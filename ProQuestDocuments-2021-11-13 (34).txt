Texto completo: Los medios estatales iraníes han asegurado este viernes que las autoridades del país han invitado a la compañía estadounidense Boeing a participar en una investigación internacional sobre uno de sus aviones, utilizado por Ucrania, siniestrado cerca de Teherán el pasado miércoles, una posibilidad que en un principio rechazaron.
En las mismas horas del accidente, este país había lanzado un ataque con misiles contra bases militares utilizadas por estadounidenses en Irak. En el siniestro del aparato murieron 176 personas.
Irán también negó ser responsable de derribar con misiles el avión siquiera por error, una tesis indicada como plausible por autoridades occidentales. Entre los países que mantienen esta posibilidad, están Estados Unidos, Canadá (país de procedencia de varios de los pasajeros a bordo del avión), Reino Unido y Australia.
Un video verificado por el diario The New York Times, y posteriormente también por NBC News, parece mostrar el momento preciso en el que el avión, que acababa de despegar del aeropuerto de Teherán fue impactado por un misil iraní y dejó de transmitir su señal antes de estrellarse el pasado miércoles.
El primer ministro canadiense, Justin Trudeau, aseguró este jueves que el hecho de que un misil haya golpeado al avión “puede que haya sido involuntario”. El presidente estadounidense, Donald Trump, dijo que tenía sus sospechas de que Irán pudiese haber derribado al avión con uno de sus misiles. “No quiero decirlo, porque otra gente también tiene esas sospechas… Alguien pudo haber cometido un error en el otro lado”, afirmó.
Las autoridades británicas invitaron a sus ciudadanos a evitar vuelos con destino a Irán, así como dentro de ese país o programados para salir de él. “Si están allí, revisen sus opciones de salida y consideren la posibilidad de marcharse”, reza el mensaje difundido por el Gobierno.
Irán, que dice que el avión sufrió un incendio antes de estrellarse y niega que el piloto haya pedido ayuda previamente a ello, invitó a sumarse al comité de investigación sobre el siniestro no solo a Boeing, sino también a Ucrania, en calidad de país propietario del aparato y emisor de la calificación del mismo, y a Francia, por ser constructor de parte de él, asegura la agencia de información estatal IRNA. También invitó a sumarse a expertos de países que perdieron a alguno de sus ciudadanos en el accidente.
El portavoz del Gobierno iraní Ali Rabiei dijo que un representante ucraniano ya está en Irán e invitó a representantes de Boeing a acudir también al país. El presidente ucraniano, Volodimir Zelenski, dijo que una investigación está en curso y solicitó a los países que sostienen que el avión fue derribado que compartan información. Canadá confirmó el envío de representantes a Irán.
Teherán había rechazado en un principio que Boeing formara parte de las pesquisas, como es habitual en estos casos. Esta empresa estadounidense mantiene importantes lazos con el Departamento de Defensa.
Irán sí invitó a la agencia de investigación de accidentes de Estados Unidos a participar en la investigación. La Junta Nacional de Seguridad en el Transporte dijo el jueves por la noche que “evaluaría su nivel de participación”, pero su papel podría verse limitado por las actuales sanciones de Estados Unidos contra Irán.
Las autoridades de Washington manifestaron temores a permitir que alguno de sus ciudadanos viaje a Irán debido a las tensiones que envuelven las relaciones entre las dos naciones.
El jefe de la Organización de la Aviación Civil iraní, Ali Abedzadeh, ha dicho este viernes que el país va a intentar descargar la información contenida en las cajas negras recuperadas en el avión siniestrado y puede pedir ayuda a otros países si no lo consigue.
La investigación sobre este accidente podría durar entre uno y dos años, según indicó.

Tensiones Teherán-Washington
Este ambiente tenso se registra en particular después de que Estados Unidos asesinara en un ataque la semana pasada al poderoso general iraní Qassem Soleimani. Trump dijo que este militar era responsable de varios actos violentos contra Estados Unidos y planeaba otros. Irán prometió venganza.
Teherán disparó el pasado martes por la noche en respuesta cohetes contra bases utilizadas por Estados Unidos, sin ocasionar en principio víctimas mortales. Después de este ataque, el clima de hostilidad entre ambas potencias pareció atenuarse.
Irán niega tajantemente haber derribado el avión ucraniano, y achaca esta acusación a una operación “psicológica” de Estados Unidos. “Es una mentira, y nadie se va a hacer responsable de una mentira”, reza el comunicado difundido por IRNA.
Las autoridades iraníes habían achacado en un principio lo ocurrido a un fallo mecánico. El aparato tenía tres años y medio de antigüedad. La aerolínea International Airlines of Ukraine, propietaria del aparato, ha asegurado: “Era uno de nuestros mejores aviones”, dijo, “dada la experiencia de la tripulación, la probabilidad de error es mínima, ni siquiera consideramos esa posibilidad”.

Texto completo: Si hay un actor que ha aprovechado la inestabilidad en Medio Oriente desde la invasión de Irak en 2003 y con la irrupción de las protestas de la primavera árabe y la lucha contra el Estado Islámico, ese ha sido Irán.
No en vano, el régimen de Sadam Husein, en sus tiempos de aliado de EE.UU. representaba una amenaza existencial literal para la Revolución islámica.
* ¿Puede la muerte de Qasem Soleimani desencadenar una guerra? (y otras preguntas tras el ataque de EE.UU. y las amenazas de Irán)
* Qasem Soleimani: 3 consecuencias internacionales de la muerte del poderoso general iraní en el ataque de EE.UU.
En los últimos años, la influencia iraní en la región se ha reforzado a través de una red de aliados en varios países.
Esa influencia se da en el contexto de conflictos como el de Siria o Yemen, y en la lucha contra el Estado Islámico en Irak.
Getty ImagesIrán ha llevado a cabo una campaña regional cultural-militar en Medio Oriente desde hace varios años.
Es lo que se conoce como “eje de la resistencia” que, según el servicio persa de la BBC, es una alianza marcadamente antiestadounidense y antiisraelí con la que Irán está reconfigurando el equilibrio de fuerzas y fortaleciendo su presencia en Medio Oriente.
Pero, ¿quién forma parte de este eje y cómo se articula?
Los movimientos de Irán en la región han alarmado a Israel, que cree que Teherán quiere establecer una especie de corredor o “cinturón terrestre” que una el país con el Mediterráneo a través de Irak, Siria y Líbano, y que serviría para transportar armas.
Los problemas económicos y las sanciones han obstaculizado las importaciones de armas de Irán, que son relativamente pequeñas en comparación con las de otros países de la región.
Getty ImagesEl “eje de la resistencia” es una alianza antiestadounidense y antiisraelí.
Según el Instituto Internacional de Estudios para la Paz de Estocolmo, el valor de las importaciones de defensa de Irán entre 2009 y 2018 fue equivalente a solo el 3,5% de las importaciones de Arabia Saudita durante el mismo período.
La mayoría de las compras iraníes provienen de Rusia y el resto de China.
En caso de conflicto, además, significaría que Israel tendría que luchar en su frontera con Siria y Líbano.
“Si hay una guerra, será regional”, le dijo al diario The New York Times Kamel Wazne, fundador del Centro de Estudios Estratégicos Estadounidense en Beirut, quien estudia las políticas de Estados Unidos e Irán en Medio Oriente.
“Cualquier confrontación será con todo el frente de resistencia contra Israel y sus partidarios”.

Texto completo: Si hay un actor que ha aprovechado la inestabilidad en Medio Oriente desde la invasión de Irak en 2003 y con la irrupción de las protestas de la primavera árabe y la lucha contra el Estado Islámico, ese ha sido Irán.
No en vano, el régimen de Sadam Husein, en sus tiempos de aliado de EE.UU. representaba una amenaza existencial literal para la Revolución islámica.
* ¿Puede la muerte de Qasem Soleimani desencadenar una guerra? (y otras preguntas tras el ataque de EE.UU. y las amenazas de Irán)
* Qasem Soleimani: 3 consecuencias internacionales de la muerte del poderoso general iraní en el ataque de EE.UU.
En los últimos años, la influencia iraní en la región se ha reforzado a través de una red de aliados en varios países.
Esa influencia se da en el contexto de conflictos como el de Siria o Yemen, y en la lucha contra el Estado Islámico en Irak.
Getty ImagesIrán ha llevado a cabo una campaña regional cultural-militar en Medio Oriente desde hace varios años.
Es lo que se conoce como “eje de la resistencia” que, según el servicio persa de la BBC, es una alianza marcadamente antiestadounidense y antiisraelí con la que Irán está reconfigurando el equilibrio de fuerzas y fortaleciendo su presencia en Medio Oriente.
Pero, ¿quién forma parte de este eje y cómo se articula?
Los movimientos de Irán en la región han alarmado a Israel, que cree que Teherán quiere establecer una especie de corredor o “cinturón terrestre” que una el país con el Mediterráneo a través de Irak, Siria y Líbano, y que serviría para transportar armas.
Los problemas económicos y las sanciones han obstaculizado las importaciones de armas de Irán, que son relativamente pequeñas en comparación con las de otros países de la región.
Getty ImagesEl “eje de la resistencia” es una alianza antiestadounidense y antiisraelí.
Según el Instituto Internacional de Estudios para la Paz de Estocolmo, el valor de las importaciones de defensa de Irán entre 2009 y 2018 fue equivalente a solo el 3,5% de las importaciones de Arabia Saudita durante el mismo período.
La mayoría de las compras iraníes provienen de Rusia y el resto de China.
En caso de conflicto, además, significaría que Israel tendría que luchar en su frontera con Siria y Líbano.
“Si hay una guerra, será regional”, le dijo al diario The New York Times Kamel Wazne, fundador del Centro de Estudios Estratégicos Estadounidense en Beirut, quien estudia las políticas de Estados Unidos e Irán en Medio Oriente.
“Cualquier confrontación será con todo el frente de resistencia contra Israel y sus partidarios”.

Texto completo: Los medios estatales iraníes han asegurado este viernes que las autoridades del país han invitado a la compañía estadounidense Boeing a participar en una investigación internacional sobre uno de sus aviones, utilizado por Ucrania, siniestrado cerca de Teherán el pasado miércoles, una posibilidad que en un principio rechazaron.
En las mismas horas del accidente, este país había lanzado un ataque con misiles contra bases militares utilizadas por estadounidenses en Irak. En el siniestro del aparato murieron 176 personas.
Irán también negó ser responsable de derribar con misiles el avión siquiera por error, una tesis indicada como plausible por autoridades occidentales. Entre los países que mantienen esta posibilidad, están Estados Unidos, Canadá (país de procedencia de varios de los pasajeros a bordo del avión), Reino Unido y Australia.
Un video verificado por el diario The New York Times, y posteriormente también por NBC News, parece mostrar el momento preciso en el que el avión, que acababa de despegar del aeropuerto de Teherán fue impactado por un misil iraní y dejó de transmitir su señal antes de estrellarse el pasado miércoles.
El primer ministro canadiense, Justin Trudeau, aseguró este jueves que el hecho de que un misil haya golpeado al avión “puede que haya sido involuntario”. El presidente estadounidense, Donald Trump, dijo que tenía sus sospechas de que Irán pudiese haber derribado al avión con uno de sus misiles. “No quiero decirlo, porque otra gente también tiene esas sospechas… Alguien pudo haber cometido un error en el otro lado”, afirmó.
Las autoridades británicas invitaron a sus ciudadanos a evitar vuelos con destino a Irán, así como dentro de ese país o programados para salir de él. “Si están allí, revisen sus opciones de salida y consideren la posibilidad de marcharse”, reza el mensaje difundido por el Gobierno.
Irán, que dice que el avión sufrió un incendio antes de estrellarse y niega que el piloto haya pedido ayuda previamente a ello, invitó a sumarse al comité de investigación sobre el siniestro no solo a Boeing, sino también a Ucrania, en calidad de país propietario del aparato y emisor de la calificación del mismo, y a Francia, por ser constructor de parte de él, asegura la agencia de información estatal IRNA. También invitó a sumarse a expertos de países que perdieron a alguno de sus ciudadanos en el accidente.
El portavoz del Gobierno iraní Ali Rabiei dijo que un representante ucraniano ya está en Irán e invitó a representantes de Boeing a acudir también al país. El presidente ucraniano, Volodimir Zelenski, dijo que una investigación está en curso y solicitó a los países que sostienen que el avión fue derribado que compartan información. Canadá confirmó el envío de representantes a Irán.
Teherán había rechazado en un principio que Boeing formara parte de las pesquisas, como es habitual en estos casos. Esta empresa estadounidense mantiene importantes lazos con el Departamento de Defensa.
Irán sí invitó a la agencia de investigación de accidentes de Estados Unidos a participar en la investigación. La Junta Nacional de Seguridad en el Transporte dijo el jueves por la noche que “evaluaría su nivel de participación”, pero su papel podría verse limitado por las actuales sanciones de Estados Unidos contra Irán.
Las autoridades de Washington manifestaron temores a permitir que alguno de sus ciudadanos viaje a Irán debido a las tensiones que envuelven las relaciones entre las dos naciones.
El jefe de la Organización de la Aviación Civil iraní, Ali Abedzadeh, ha dicho este viernes que el país va a intentar descargar la información contenida en las cajas negras recuperadas en el avión siniestrado y puede pedir ayuda a otros países si no lo consigue.
La investigación sobre este accidente podría durar entre uno y dos años, según indicó.

Tensiones Teherán-Washington
Este ambiente tenso se registra en particular después de que Estados Unidos asesinara en un ataque la semana pasada al poderoso general iraní Qassem Soleimani. Trump dijo que este militar era responsable de varios actos violentos contra Estados Unidos y planeaba otros. Irán prometió venganza.
Teherán disparó el pasado martes por la noche en respuesta cohetes contra bases utilizadas por Estados Unidos, sin ocasionar en principio víctimas mortales. Después de este ataque, el clima de hostilidad entre ambas potencias pareció atenuarse.
Irán niega tajantemente haber derribado el avión ucraniano, y achaca esta acusación a una operación “psicológica” de Estados Unidos. “Es una mentira, y nadie se va a hacer responsable de una mentira”, reza el comunicado difundido por IRNA.
Las autoridades iraníes habían achacado en un principio lo ocurrido a un fallo mecánico. El aparato tenía tres años y medio de antigüedad. La aerolínea International Airlines of Ukraine, propietaria del aparato, ha asegurado: “Era uno de nuestros mejores aviones”, dijo, “dada la experiencia de la tripulación, la probabilidad de error es mínima, ni siquiera consideramos esa posibilidad”.

Kristof: Trump has a bizarre idea of winning

Texto completo: For now we seem to have averted an all-out shooting war between the United States and Iran.
Yet it’s not over. The world is more dangerous than it was a week ago, and President Donald Trump’s exuberance suggests that he may have learned precisely the wrong lesson from his clash with Iran.
Trump and some of his supporters are crowing at the lack of American casualties — Iran may have carefully aimed so as to miss people — in ways that remind me of the hubris preceding the 2003 invasion of Iraq. As there were then, there are today concerns about whether intelligence has been overstated, leaders are thumping their chests, and there’s too much confidence in the ability of the military toolbox to solve complex problems.
Trump, who in 2012 repeatedly claimed that President Barack Obama would start a war with Iran to help win reelection, is already running election ads on Facebook trumpeting his killing of Gen. Qassem Soleimani and saying that this is “keeping America safe.” Hmm. Look at the results so far:
— Iran has cast off nuclear curbs so that it is now potentially within five months of having enough fuel for a nuclear warhead, down from almost 15 years when Trump took office.
— United States forces may be pushed out of Iraq, allowing Soleimani to achieve in death one of his foremost goals in life.
— American forces in Syria may be difficult to support without the military presence in Iraq, so some or all of them might pull out as well, another strategic victory for Iran.
— The military campaign against the Islamic State is on hold, giving terrorists a chance to regroup.
— Iran’s regime, which had been threatened by enormous protests at home and in Iraq, has been rescued by Trump’s actions. Iranians have rallied around the flag, and the Iraqi narrative has changed overnight from the bullying of Iranians to the bullying of Americans.
— Instead of bringing troops home, Trump has had to deploy more to the Middle East at huge cost. We may think we can’t afford universal pre-K, but we don’t blink at lavishing billions of dollars on these military deployments.
— North Korea has gained leverage, because it knows that Trump has little appetite for two international security crises at the same time. Kim Jong Un has also surely absorbed the lesson that he must never give up his nuclear warheads, as Trump will strike countries that lack nuclear weapons while schmoozing with leaders who have them.
So much winning! And there will be more.
It’s true that Iran’s foreign minister, Javad Zarif, said that Iran’s response had “concluded,” but Zarif is a moderate often outmaneuvered by hard-liners. I know this partly because back in 2004, after Zarif approved a visa for me, I was detained in Iran by security forces looking for information that could embarrass Zarif and get him fired.
My best guess is that Iran will strike back hard in a way that leaves it some plausible deniability. Perhaps it’ll be a truck bomb at a diplomatic mission or a Trump property, or perhaps rocket attacks on a military site by a proxy, or a cyberattack on an oil refinery or the power grid, or perhaps mines that damage oil tankers in the Strait of Hormuz. Iran has options, and let’s not celebrate prematurely.
One reason to worry is that both sides have shown such a capacity for bellicosity and miscalculation.
Trump miscalculated by initially failing to respond adequately to a series of Iranian provocations beginning in May, leading to underdeterrence. Then he overreacted on Dec. 29, with strikes that killed two dozen people, and then again with the killing of Soleimani, in each case failing to appreciate the risks to Americans in Iraq.
As for Iran, the best evidence of Soleimani’s miscalculation is simple: He’s dead.
Perhaps the most consistent foreign policy mistake that the United States has made in my lifetime is a failure to appreciate nationalism, from Vietnam to Afghanistan, Iraq to Latin America. It’s an odd mistake for a country that was born because King George III failed to accommodate our own nationalism. Yet today as well we often overstate Iran’s religiosity but underappreciate its nationalist sensitivities.
I’ve found on my visits to Iran that when we don’t muck things up, ordinary Iranians are among the most pro-American people in the region. That time I was detained in Iran, my bags were carefully examined and X-rayed by a security goon, who snarled at me: “American reporters — bad!” Another X-ray operator nearby apparently didn’t quite realize what was going on, because he beamed at me and said in the friendliest of tones: “Americans — very good!”
Some day, people like the second X-ray operator will inherit his country, if we can avoid wars and manage the nuclear crisis. But the basic rule in international security, as in medicine, is “first, do no harm,” and Trump has violated that.

Texto completo: TWO weeks from now, thousands of Pro Life teenagers will converge on the nation's capital to rally in support of the unborn at the 47th annual March for Life.
Unfortunately, many people are uncomfortable with the idea that millennials would raise their voices to oppose abortion. The image of young kids standing together with signs that read "Choose Life" and "Abortion Stops a Beating Heart" can be disconcerting when you are used to hearing it's only old white men who want to strip women of the "right to choose."
That's the only explanation I have for what some people did to a young Catholic student from Kentucky last year, when he and his classmates from Covington Catholic High attended the March for Life. As a bunch of them waitedfor their bus to pick them up, a Native American activist named Nathan Phillips approached banging his drum. Some of the boys reacted chanting their school song while one of them, Nicholas Sandmann, stood face to face with Phillips. The boy was smiling, although many characterized his expression as a "smirk." The screen shot of that encounter went viral, and was used to attack Sandmann as a bigoted, privileged white boy who was mocking both ethnic minorities and a woman's "right to choose."
Now Sandmann has finally gotten some vindication via a settlement announced this week with CNN, whom Sandmann sued for defamation - and was just one of many outlets and public figures who took shots at the teen.
One of the most offensive comments was from Rep. Ilhan Omar (D.,Minn.), who incorrectly tweeted, "The boys were protesting a woman's right to choose & yelled 'it's not rape if you enjoy it.' " She later deleted the tweet.
Maggie Haberman of the New York Times observed that "There are dozens of students laughing and egging on the behavior. Will be interesting to see if anyone is actually expelled, as officials suggest is possible," creating the false impression that the Catholic high school students were the aggressors.
HBO host Bill Maher called Sandmann a word normally used to describe a man's sexual organ.
The Washington Post came out with an initial story that falsely claimed the Covington Catholic students, some of whom were wore MAGA hats, chanted "Build that wall" without any audio or video corroboration.
Some of the worst offenders were affiliated with CNN. Bakari Sellers, a regular contributor, tweeted: "[Sandmann] is a deplorable. Some ppl can also be punched in the face." Reza Aslan, another personality who also appeared on CNN picked up the assault theme by tweeting "Honest question. Have you ever seen a more punchable face than this kid's?" (He reportedly only deleted that tweet this past week.) Conservative commentator S.E. Cupp, who hosts a CNN show called "Unflitered," tweeted "Teens in MAGA gear mock a Native American Vietnam vet." She later walked that back and apologized, but the damage was done.
Because of the overwrought, under-researched comments from many in the public eye, Sandmann and his family were subjected to months of harassment. His family had to leave their house for a time, they received death threats, and he was told not to come back to school in the days immediately after the incident. Even a Kentucky Catholic diocese initially condemned Sandmann.
In response, his family filed a defamation lawsuit against numerous media outlets including CNN and the Washington Post. CNN settled for an undisclosed amount, and the Post case is ongoing.
As an attorney, I know settlements are not a legal admission of guilt. But as a human being who understands it is natural to defend yourself when you think you are right, I'm convinced CNN believed it would lose where it counts the most: the court of public opinion.
Journalists can be heard wailing these days about assaults on the press. I think it is important, though, to examine those cases where they themselves are the assailants. This is one.
Based on incomplete facts and in a desire to get the story out as quickly as possible, some very powerful media outlets defamed a young boy, and created an environment where he was threatened. I am convinced this was, in large part, because he was a young white man with pro-life beliefs.
Sandmann: 1, CNN: (lots of) 0s.

And ZEKE MILLER
The Associated Press
WASHINGTON - It is "highly likely" that Iran shot down the civilian Ukrainian jetliner that crashed near Tehran late Tuesday, killing all 176 people on board, U.S., Canadian and British officials declared Thursday. They said the fiery missile strike could well have been a mistake amid rocket launches and high tension throughout the region.
The crash came just a few hours after Iran launched a ballistic-missile attack against Iraqi military bases housing U.S. troops in its violent confrontation with Washington over the U.S. drone strike that killed an Iranian Revolutionary Guard general. The airliner could have been mistaken for a threat, said four U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive intelligence.
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, whose country lost at least 63 citizens in the downing, said in Toronto: "We have intelligence from multiple sources including our allies and our own intelligence. The evidence indicates that the plane was shot down by an Iranian surface-to-air missile."
Likewise, U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison offered similar statements. Morrison also said it appeared to be a mistake. "All of the intelligence as presented to us today does not suggest an intentional act," he said.
The assessment that 176 people were killed as collateral damage in the Iranian-U.S. conflict cast a new pall over what had at first appeared to be a relatively calm aftermath following the U.S. military operation that killed Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani.
It was not immediately clear how the U.S. and its allies would react. Despite efforts by Washington and Tehran to step back from the brink of possible war, the region remained on edge after the killing of the Iranian general and Iran's retaliatory missile strikes. U.S. troops were on high-alert.
At the White House, President Donald Trump suggested he believed Iran was responsible for the shootdown and dismissed Iran's initial claim that it was a mechanical issue with the plane.
"Somebody could have made a mistake on the other side." Trump said, noting the plane was flying in a "pretty rough neighborhood."
Late Thursday, the U.S. House approved a measure that aims to bar any further military action against Iran without congressional approval. However, the resolution approved by the Democratic-majority House is nonbinding and, at any rate, no similar measure could pass the Republican-controlled Senate.
As for the airliner shootdown, the U.S. officials wouldn't say what intelligence they had that pointed to an Iranian missile. But they acknowledged the existence of satellites and other sensors in the region, as well as the likelihood of communication interceptions and other similar intelligence.
The New York Times posted a video Thursday it said it had verified showing the moment the apparent missile struck the plane over Iran. The video shows a fast-moving object rising before a fiery explosion. An object, apparently on fire, then continues in a different direction.
A preliminary Iranian investigative report released Thursday said that the airliner pilots never made a radio call for help and that the aircraft was trying to turn back for the airport when the burning plane went down.
The Iranian report suggested that a sudden emergency struck the Boeing 737 operated by Ukrainian International Airlines late Tuesday, when it crashed, just minutes after taking off from Imam Khomeini International Airport in Tehran.
Investigators from Iran's Civil Aviation Organization offered no immediate explanation for the disaster, however. Iranian officials initially blamed a technical malfunction for the crash, something backed by Ukrainian officials before they said they wouldn't speculate amid an ongoing investigation.
Before the U.S. assessment, Iran's state-run IRNA news agency quoted Hasan Rezaeifa, the head of the of civil aviation accident investigation commission, claiming that "the topics of rocket, missile or anti-aircraft system is ruled out."
The Ukrainian International Airlines took off at 6:12a.m. Wednesday, Tehran time, after nearly an hour's delay at Tehran's Imam Khomeini Airport, the main airport for travelers in Iran. It gained altitude heading west, reaching nearly 8,000 feet, according to both the report and flight-tracking data.
Then something went wrong, though "no radio messages were received from the pilot regarding unusual situations," the report said. In emergencies, pilots reach out to air-traffic controllers to warn them and to clear the runway for their arrival, though their first priority is to keep the aircraft flying.
Eyewitnesses, including the crew of another flight passing above, described seeing the plane engulfed in flames before crashing at 6:18a.m., the report said. The crash caused a massive explosion when the plane hit the ground, likely because the aircraft had been fully loaded with fuel for the flight to Kyiv, Ukraine.
The report also confirmed that both of the "black boxes" that contain data and cockpit communications from the plane had been recovered, though they sustained damage and some parts of their memory was lost.
Hours before the plane crash the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration had issued an emergency flight restriction barring U.S. carriers and pilots from flying over areas of Iraqi, Iranian and some Persian Gulf airspace warning of the "potential for miscalculation or misidentification" for civilian aircraft due to heightened political and military tensions.
Oleksiy Danilov, secretary of Ukraine's Security Council, told Ukrainian media that officials had several working theories regarding the crash, including a missile strike.
"A strike by a missile, possibly a Tor missile system, is among the main (theories), as information has surfaced on the internet about elements of a missile being found near the site of the crash," Danilov said.
Ukrainian investigators who arrived in Iran on Thursday awaited permission from Iranian authorities to examine the crash site and look for missile fragments, Danilov said.
The Tor is a Russian-made missile system. Russia delivered 29 Tor-M1s to Iran in 2007, and Iran has displayed the missiles in military parades.
Iran did not immediately respond to the Ukrainian comments. However, Gen. Abolfazl Shekarchi, the spokesman of the Iranian armed forces, denied a missile hit the airplane in a comments reported Wednesday by the semiofficial Fars news agency. He dismissed the allegation as "psychological warfare" by foreign-based Iranian opposition groups.
Ukraine has a grim history with missile attacks, including in July 2014 when one such strike downed a Malaysian Airlines flight over eastern Ukraine, killing all 298 people aboard.
The plane was carrying 167 passengers and nine crew members from several countries, including 82 Iranians, at least 63 Canadians and 11 Ukrainians, according to officials. Many of the passengers were believed to be international students attending universities in Canada; they were making their way back to Toronto by way of Kyiv after visiting with family during the winter break.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said, "Undoubtedly, the priority for Ukraine is to identify the causes of the plane crash. We will surely find out the truth."
The crash ranked among the worst losses of life for Canadians in an aviation disaster. The flag over Parliament in Ottawa was lowered to half-staff, and Prime Minister Trudeau vowed to get to the bottom of the disaster.
The U.S. accident investigator, the National Transportation Safety Board, is talking to the State Department and the Treasury Department about traveling to Iran to inspect the U.S.-built aircraft and working with Iranian authorities despite U.S. economic sanctions against that country. I n a statement Thursday the NTSB said it "continues to monitor the situation surrounding the crash and evaluate its level of participation in the investigation."
U.S. officials have expressed concerned about sending employees to Iran because of the heightened tensions.

Texto completo: Michael Cohen, President Donald Trump's former personal lawyer, says his prison sentence should be reduced because he offered prosecutors information about the donor behind a $900,000 contribution to Trump's inaugural committee, court records show.
Trump's onetime legal fixer made the claim in court filings his attorney submitted Thursday and Friday to convince a judge to reduce his three-year prison sentence. Cohen is serving time for pleading guilty to coordinating hush money payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal.
The women said they'd had sexual affairs with Trump before his presidency. He has denied the claims.
Battling prosecutors who have questioned his credibility, Cohen has argued the Department of Justice "acted in bad faith" by not considering his efforts to supply evidence of other potential criminal wrongdoing. The agency, he claims, shut down investigations of "all matters Trump. "
In one of the latest filings, defense attorney Roger Adler wrote that Cohen's sentence should be shortened in part because Cohen offered potential evidence against Trump inaugural committee donor Imaad Zuberi.
Zuberi, a California-based venture capitalist, agreed in October to plead guilty to federal charges that he hid his work as a foreign agent while lobbying U. S. government officials. He also admitted to making illegal campaign contributions. Representatives of foreign clients are required to register their activities with the Department of Justice.
On Tuesday, federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York accused Zuberi of obstructing a federal grand jury investigation into the source of funds he used for the inaugural committee contribution.
The court filing accused Zuberi of backdating a $50,000 check he allegedly used to refund money that an undisclosed American national had given him for the contribution. Zuberi also allegedly deleted emails between him and a foreign national who transferred $5. 8 million to the account used to fund the contribution.
Zuberi tried to hide evidence of the transactions after he learned about the federal investigation, prosecutors alleged.
Prosecutors made the accusation in a type of court filing that typically signals the defendant has made a plea agreement.
David Kelley, a former Manhattan U. S. attorney representing Zuberi, told The Washington Post his client had reached a plea agreement on the obstruction charge but had not agreed to a broader cooperation agreement. Kelley did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment on Friday.
Prosecutors have not disclosed specifics about any evidence or information offered by Cohen, including anything involving Zuberi. However, The New York Times reported last year that prosecutors questioned Cohen about Zuberi as they investigated Zuberi's contribution to the Trump inaugural committee.
Prosecutors have rejected Cohen's claims that he should get a lighter sentence because he helped them.
In a Dec. 19 court filing, prosecutors said the Manhattan U. S. Attorney's Office had "reasonably determined that Cohen did not provide substantial assistance after his sentencing. " They said they had "substantial concerns about Cohen's credibility. "
The prosecutors asked U. S. District Court Judge William Pauley, who sentenced Cohen, to dismiss his arguments for a sentence reduction without conducting a court hearing.
In response to that, Adler wrote, "Ordering a hearing is, we submit, the appropriate judicial response to known litigative 'stonewalling. '"

MIT administrators knew about Jeffrey Epstein's $850K in donations

Texto completo: BOSTON — Three top administrators at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology knew about donations from Jeffrey Epstein to support an MIT lab as early as 2013, according to a new report, and approved his money even though they were aware of his sex crimes.
A new internal report released Friday by MIT found "significant errors in judgment" in accepting $850,000 in donations from Epstein from 2002 through 2017. The donations included 10 payments overall and nine after the wealthy financier's 2008 sex crime conviction in Florida.
The report found most of the post-conviction donations, totaling $525,000, were made to support the work of MIT's embattled Media Lab, led by former director Joi Ito, while $225,000 went to Seth Lloyd, a professor of mechanical engineering and engineering systems and physics.
More: MIT Media Lab chief out after 'deeply disturbing' link to Jeffrey Epstein
But despite accepting Epstein's donations by marking them down as anonymous gifts, the report said the administrators did not violate the law or MIT policy.
"Since MIT had no policy or processes for handling controversial donors in place at the time, the decision to accept Epstein’s post-conviction donations cannot be judged to be a policy violation," the 61-page report reads. "But it is clear that the decision was the result of collective and significant errors in judgment that resulted in serious damage to the MIT community. "
The report, led by the Boston-based law firm Goodwin Procter, concluded that the post-2008 conviction donations to MIT were driven by Ito or Lloyd, not the administration.
Lloyd, a tenured professor, was put on paid administrative leave by the university Friday. Ito resigned as head of the lab in September after The New Yorker first reported on the lab donations, prompting MIT to open an investigation into what it called "deeply disturbing" links between the lab and Epstein.
Investigators cleared MIT's central administration of wrongdoing and said MIT President Rafael Reif was not aware of Epstein's donations, nor was he aware MIT was accepting donations from a sex offender and accused pedophile.
But the firm said three administrators — Vice President and General Counsel Gregory Morgan, Vice President for Resource Development Jeffrey Newton, and Executive Vice President and Treasurer Israel Ruiz — knew about the donations in 2013. That year, the investigation found, the three employees created a new framework "under which all subsequent Epstein donations to MIT were ultimately approved and accepted. "
The report found these administrators were not seeking personal gain but instead were "trying to balance the competing objectives of obtaining funding for Media Lab programs, while denying Epstein any personal benefit from his association with MIT. Morgan and Newton are retired from the university, the New York Times reported, while MIT announced last month that Ruiz would step down for a career outside of academia.
"By insisting that such donations remain anonymous, they also were attempting to protect MIT’s reputation," the report says. "Regardless of their intent, these administrators were aware of the risk that the donations might become public, but did not adequately consider the potential damage accepting donations from a convicted sex offender could cause to the MIT community. "
Epstein died Aug. 10 in a New York federal jail cell in what authorities determined was a suicide. It came as he was facing new federal sex trafficking charges.

Epstein visited professors on MIT's campus at least nine times between 2013 and 2017, according to the report, but investigators found "no evidence" that anyone in MIT’s central administration was aware of any of the trips.
The $850,000 donation figure does not include $60,000 that Epstein gave to Lloyd around 2005 to 2006 that was deposited into the professor's personal bank account, the report says.
The report claims Lloyd "purposefully failed" to inform MIT that Epstein was the source behind two separate $50,000 donations made in 2012. It says he later solicited a $125,000 donation from Epstein that was made in 2017.
Ito, who also taught at MIT, resigned hours after a September article in The New Yorker detailed how his lab accepted gifts from Epstein despite being listed as “disqualified” in MIT’s official donor database. The article said the lab listed Epstein's contributions as anonymous and avoided disclosing to the school the full extent of his involvement.
Ito disclosed that he had received $1. 2 million from Epstein for investment funds Ito controlled in addition to the $525,000 lab donation.
Through his wealth, Epstein developed connections at elite universities, including MIT and Harvard University. He gave nearly $9 million to Harvard over the in donations. After initially saying they had "no plans" to return the money to Epstein, Harvard in September announced the university is reviewing his donations.

Texto completo: The chief legal officer of Google parent Alphabet Inc. is leaving the company amid an investigation into his relationships with employees of the search-engine giant.
David Drummond, 56 years old, said he would retire at the end of the month from Alphabet after nearly 20 years of service, according to a securities filing Friday. In a memo to employees, Mr. Drummond said it is "the right time for me to make way for the next generation of leaders."
A Google spokeswoman said Mr. Drummond isn't receiving an exit package from the company.
Since November, Mr. Drummond has sold more than $221 million in Google stock, according to securities filings. He received about $47.3 million in total compensation including stock awards in 2018, company filings show, making him one of Alphabet's highest-paid executives.
Alphabet has said it was investigating Mr. Drummond's alleged misconduct.
Mr. Drummond's departure comes a month after the company shuffled its management structure , with co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin stepping down from day-to-day responsibilities and making Sundar Pichai chief executive of both Alphabet and Google.
Mr. Drummond, who joined Google full-time in 2002, has been working on Alphabet's investments including venture-capital arm GV and private-equity firm CapitalG, as well as legal matters related to the Alphabet structure. During his tenure, he had a hand in negotiating major acquisitions including Motorola Mobility and YouTube.
One year ago, a group of Alphabet shareholders sued several company officers and directors including Mr. Drummond, alleging "active and direct participation in a multi-year scheme to cover up sexual harassment and discrimination at Alphabet," according to a complaint filed in the San Mateo County Superior Court in California.
The suit, which is pending, accuses Mr. Drummond of concealing an affair with former Google employee Jennifer Blakely. It also claims he had knowledge of pervasive sexual harassment by Google executives and was complicit in failing to disclose the harassment and taking steps to cover it up.
Alphabet has declined to comment on the allegations.
Several other Alphabet shareholders have sued the company since January of last year.
In an August post on the blog site Medium, Ms. Blakely said that she began a relationship with Mr. Drummond in 2004 while she worked with him in the company's legal department and that she had a child with him in 2007.
Mr. Drummond has had romantic relationships with Google staffers other than Ms. Blakely, according to a person familiar with the matter.
"David was well aware that our relationship was in violation of Google's new policy which went from 'discouraging' direct-reporting-line relationships to outright banning them," she wrote.
In a statement to BuzzFeed last year, Mr. Drummond said that while he was "far from perfect," he had a "very different view" of Ms. Blakely's claims. "Her account raises many claims about us and other people, including our son and my former wife," he said. "As you would expect, there are two sides to all of the conversations and details Jennifer recounts, and I take a very different view about what happened."
A special committee formed by Alphabet's board hired law firm Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP and Abrams & Bayliss LLP last year to investigate how executives at the search giant have handled claims of sexual harassment and other misconduct.
An Alphabet spokeswoman said an initial investigation has been completed and the board committee will continue to engage with the plaintiffs in mediation.
Thousands of Google employees world-wide staged walkouts last year to protest the tech giant's treatment of executives, including Mr. Drummond, accused of pursuing relationships with staff.

Steel Hub's Comeback Preceded Trump, But He Benefits

Texto completo: BETHLEHEM - Just a few blocks from the rusted 16-story blast furnaces that once fired hulking steel beams for the Hoover Dam and the Golden Gate Bridge, OraSure Technologies each day produces thousands of thumbnail-size pads made to spit on.
These oral swabs, part of a home HIV test kit, are products of a matrix of manufacturers, financial companies and health care institutions powering the Lehigh Valley’s $41 billion economy.
The region’s success distinguishes it from onetime industrial dynamos in the Northeast and Midwest that have struggled to replace shuttered plants and vanishing jobs. While many midsize and smaller cities have lost out to the superstars - large urban metropolises that gulp up scads of employers, workers and customers - the Lehigh Valley is booming.
“There’s jobs everywhere,” said Stephen Polczer, 46, as he
inspected assembled swabs. Polczer, outfitted with a blue mesh apron for his beard and a head cap, started at the biomedical company less than two months ago, drawn by a $17-an-hour wage for manufacturing technicians and a four-day workweek.
The economic renaissance has been more than a decade in the making in this eastern stretch of Pennsylvania, and it has much to do with location, luck and local leaders.
“It’s transcended presidents and administrations,” said Don Cunningham, president and chief executive of the Lehigh Valley Economic Development Corp., a public-private partnership. In the last five years, employers created 26,000 additional jobs. “It began under Obama and continued under Trump,” he said.
The valley’s political affinities have been less steady recently. The area includes Northampton County, one of the few counties nationwide - and among only three in the state - that voted for Barack Obama twice before giving Donald Trump a plurality in 2016. That pivot, in a county that a Republican presidential candidate had not won since 1988, helped Trump capture Pennsylvania by less than 1 percentage point.
Trump’s message on trade and defending jobs resonated in the Lehigh Valley, where there are memories of how foreign competition clobbered the local steel and cement industries.
Whenever the rebound began, people here are feeling more secure economically, and many credit the president. “The economy is 100 times better,” Polczer said, “and it has a lot to do with President Trump.”
Incentives for business,
amenities for workers
A junction for interstate highways and rail lines, the Lehigh Valley is within an eight-hour drive of one-third of U.S. consumers. That has helped attract an army of warehouses and distribution centers built by Amazon, Walmart, FedEx and UPS as they scramble to keep up with the explosion of online shopping.
A network of nearby universities, community colleges and vocational high schools pumps out workers with a range of skills. And there is more available land, cheaper housing and lower taxes than in neighboring New Jersey, Philadelphia or New York City.
Local and state officials laid the groundwork for a possible revival after Bethlehem’s colossal mills closed completely in 1998. They built industrial and office parks and offered millions of dollars in tax credits and abatements to lure companies to Northampton and Lehigh counties.
Freshpet joined a growing cluster of food and beverage companies - including Boston Beer, Nestle Purina, Ocean Spray and Just Born (maker of the chick-shaped marshmallow treat Peeps) - when it took over an old dairy factory in Northampton County in 2013. Sales of Freshpet’s refrigerated meals for dogs and cats - made from giant vats of slow-cooked meat, vegetables and fruit that can be smelled before entering the parking lot - grew 27% in the last year.
Now the company is building a $100 million facility in its own backyard that will ultimately add 150 people to the payroll. The state and county kicked in $900,000 in grants and tax credits.
A couple of blocks away in the same Hanover Twp. industrial park, Stuffed Puffs - chocolate-filled marshmallows that first appeared in stores in May - broke ground in November on a 150,000-square-foot manufacturing plant that will employ 134 people.
The venture is backed by Factory, a business innovation center for growing food and beverage companies founded by Richard Thompson, a former chief executive at Freshpet. Hoisting up a couple of bags, he explained that the creator of Stuffed Puffs had “spent seven years figuring out how to put the chocolate inside the marshmallow.”
With support from a New York hedge fund, Thompson opened the center in 2019. “I looked everywhere from Boston to Jacksonville,” Florida, he said, before choosing a site once occupied by Bethlehem Steel.
Just to the north in rural Upper Mount Bethel Twp., Air Liquide opened a plant in 2018 to produce specialty chemicals for semiconductors, and construction on an adjoining facility has started.
Tony Stump began working there over the summer in a full-time maintenance job for $26.50 an hour, plus benefits.
He moved from Apollo, a former coal-mining town about 35 miles from Pittsburgh, to take the job. “It’s like two different worlds,” he said.
“There’s a lot of job opportunities,” Stump said of the Pittsburgh area, “but it’s harder to make a good wage.”
At his previous job, Stump made $15 an hour and had not had a raise in seven years. “There’s no way to survive,” he said.
Lots of jobs, but
‘not real good jobs’
Many of the jobs available are like the one Stump left behind. “They’re not real good jobs,” said Tom Sedor, 78. A third-generation steelworker on both sides of his family, Sedor sat with a group of other retirees in a small storefront office in the mall that houses the Steelworkers’ Archives, an oral history project.
The rich and the well-educated techies are doing well, but the working class and the poor “are the ones that are really getting hammered,” Sedor said. “It hasn’t trickled down to them.”
Although the area’s median income is more than $65,000, a new report from the United Way of Pennsylvania found that 30% of the households in Northampton County and 25% in Lehigh County could be counted among the working poor.
The steelworkers, both Democrats and Republicans, who crowded into the Wind Creek office don’t like Trump, whom they characterized as anti-union. But Sedor acknowledged that a lot of other retired steelworkers voted for him over Hillary Clinton in 2016.
“Hillary and the Democratic Party didn’t pay enough attention to trade,” Sedor said. Many of the men he meets for breakfast or sees in the union hall are still behind the president. “They’re adamant about it because of trade,” he said.
There were other motivations as well, the group agreed. “They also loved what Trump was saying about immigrants and gun control,” said Lester Clore, a 33-year veteran of Bethlehem Steel, referring to the president’s pledge to keep out immigrants and oppose gun restrictions.
Since the last presidential election, Democrats have had a wave of victories in the Lehigh Valley, sweeping local elections. A Democrat won a reconfigured congressional seat in 2018 after a moderate Republican retired. In statewide elections, the Democratic governor and senator were both reelected with hearty margins.
Although it is a quintessentially purple area, registered Democrats far outnumber registered Republicans in both Northampton and Lehigh counties.
According to one recent statewide poll, 57% of those surveyed said they did not think the president deserved reelection.
But Christopher Borick, director of the Muhlenberg College Institute of Public Opinion in Allentown, said that across Pennsylvania, the president remained popular among those who said they had voted for him.
Recent polling by The New York Times/Siena College found that in Pennsylvania and five other battleground states, nearly two-thirds of voters with a similar pattern - supporting Trump in 2016 and a Democrat in the midterms - said they intended to back the president.
Among the more than 30 business owners, professionals and employees interviewed in the two counties, many said their votes were still up for grabs. But “Medicare for All,” free public college tuition and other left-leaning proposals championed by candidates like Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., aroused more skepticism than enthusiasm.
The Democrats named as possibilities were all moderates, like former Vice President Joe Biden; Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn.; former Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana; or the latest entrant, billionaire businessman Michael Bloomberg.
“I think there’s going to be a strong pull for Democrats in the county to come home if they can,” said John Kincaid, a government professor at Lafayette College in Easton. But the Democrats will need to offer more than someone-who-is-not-Trump.
“If Warren or Sanders is the candidate,” he said, “it’s going to be harder to bring those Democrats who voted for Trump over.”

Texto completo: Steep price awaits
Editor: It has been three years since Inauguration Day when Democrats said they would impeach the man the American people voted to be the president.
It has been three years since Democrats promised that they would overturn the votes of 63 million Americans. Democrats said that they would be better to run the House of Representatives. They would fix the health care system, fix our crumbling infrastructure and put an end to the opioid crisis that kills 130 Americans every day. That’s more than 46,280 people since Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi and Democrats have been in charge.
Instead, for three years Democrats have searched for a crime so that they could impeach a president they don’t like. Clearly, the American people could not elect a Washington outsider who promised to drain the swamp and put the American people first, the forgotten Americans, those that have been discarded by the Washington elites.
You know, the basket of deplorables who weren’t smart enough to elect Hillary Clinton and instead made Donald Trump president. He not only kept his promise to put America first but is also leading the greatest economic resurgence in modern history. There are more Americans working than at any time in history, wages for blue-collar and middle-class families are rising. He commits to securing our borders and protecting Americans.
Democrats continue wasting millions of dollars of taxpayer money on an impeachment sham in search of a crime. The American people are tired of it, fatigued and fed up. In some districts across America where Democrats won House seats, those same voters elected Donald Trump. They didn’t vote for them to impeach their president. This November there will be a price to pay.

Brutish performance
Editor: John Kalafut scorched Sondra Myers for what he calls tirades against President Trump (“Lies part of Trump’s act,” Dec. 31).
In it he said “Oh! but there are his ‘lies.’ Trump often exaggerates, misstates and crack crude jokes. It’s all part of his shtick. He has never uttered an untruth that has endangered the nation.”
Kalafut left out a few other things that are his “shtick” like meanness, threatening people, being unforgiving, bullying and other character detriments.
Here’s what the Bible tells us that will cause the wrath of God. In Colossians, “But you must rid your self of these things: anger, rage, malice, slander and filthy language from your lips. Do not lie to each other . . .” It also talks about sexual immorality and greed. I don’t see anything about someone’s “shtick” making it OK.
The New York Times has followed Trump’s tweets since he took office and found that out of the 11,000 tweets he created, 5,889 have been attacks. I find it hard to see how you can excuse that when more than half of his tweets carry out what the Bible tells us not to do. Jesus tells us we should love our neighbor.
In my New International Version Study Bible there are 233 verses that deal with truth. So truth must be pretty important to anyone, especially Christians. John (4:24) says, “We must worship in spirit and truth.” John (14:6) says, “Jesus said, ‘I am the way and the truth and the life.’ ”
There are things on which I agree with Trump, but it’s hard to get past his meanness. One is that he doesn’t need anyone’s advice, even if it endangers the nation. His motto should be “make America hate again,” which he has accomplished. Thanks to Sondra Myers for telling the truth.

Harvey’s Show Goes On

Texto completo: Harvey Weinstein hobbled into a New York court Monday, leaning on a walker cushioned by two bright green tennis balls. Bent and shuffling, he no longer appeared to be the entitled movie mogul who believed he could help himself to any woman he desired.
Instead, the man whose sexual bullying helped fuel the rage behind the MeToo movement appears weak, pale and pathetic. It all feels very calculated.
Just last month, he told the New York Post that he’s the victim here.
“I feel like the forgotten man,” he told the Post. “I made more movies directed by women and about women than any filmmaker, and I’m talking about 30 years ago.. I did it first! I pioneered it! It all got eviscerated because of what happened.”
Note the semantic sleight of hand: “because of what happened,” not “because of what I did.”
Though more than 80 women have accused the once-fearsome producer, he faces charges in this trial for the harm he is alleged to have inflicted on only two: a woman who says he raped her in a Manhattan hotel in 2013 and another who says he forced oral sex on her at his home in 2006.
In an excellent turn of events, he also may face a second criminal trial. Monday, Los Angeles County District Attorney Jackie Lacey announced she would file four counts of rape and sexual battery against Weinstein involving alleged sexual attacks on two women in hotels in Los Angeles and Beverly Hills.
Whether he will be convicted on any of these counts is far from certain, but just seeing him in court is a balm.
“It’s good to see Lady Justice staring him down,” said one of his earliest accusers, Rose McGowan. “It feels like a huge win already.”
Weinstein’s wretched behavior left a trail of destruction behind him: The ruined or stymied careers of women who fought him off at their own peril, the stars who got work only at a steep cost to their well-being, the enablers and defenders who tossed their scruples out the window to protect him by helping silence accusers with financial settlements, which came with nondisclosure agreements that enabled him to continue behaving as he always had.
I can’t look at Weinstein without thinking about Bill Cosby, who got what was coming, and now sits, remorseless, in a Pennsylvania jail. Or men like Matt Lauer, Les Moonves, Charlie Rose and dozens of others who lost their jobs but never really took responsibility for their actions.
But have things changed?
Certainly, that’s the case in the upper professional echelons. One year after the Weinstein scandal broke, The New York Times reported that of the 201 powerful men who lost their jobs as a result of sexual misconduct allegations, nearly half were replaced by women.
Tanzina Vega replaced John Hockenberry on WNYC’s “The Takeaway.” Jennifer Salke replaced Ted Price as head of Amazon Studios. Alex Wagner replaced Mark Halperin as co-host of Showtime’s “The Circus.” Rachel Rosenfelt replaced Hamilton Fish as publisher/president of the New Republic, and she was herself replaced last year by another woman, Kerrie Gillis.
At least a dozen states have passed legislation addressing workplace sexual harassment, including California, which requires that publicly traded companies based in the state appoint women to their boards.
Monday, I watched a live feed of Weinstein’s courthouse entrance, then a nearby press conference by seven of his accusers, including McGowan, Rosanna Arquette and TV journalist Lauren Sivan. They call themselves the Silence Breakers. “Living in silence,” McGowan said, “is a death sentence for your soul.”
The women watched as Weinstein entered the court flanked by attorneys and beefy bodyguards.
“Did you see the thugs who were protecting him?” asked Arquette. “Like a Scorcese movie!”
Sivan genially introduced herself as “the potted plant girl.”
In 2007 at a Manhattan business dinner, she has alleged, Weinstein lured her into the restaurant section of a club he had invested in, trapped her, then masturbated into a potted plant when she refused him.
“I’m OK being known as ‘the potted plant girl’ as long as he’s forever known as the predator that he is,” she said.
Sivan has the distinction of having been targeted by Weinstein and Roger Ailes, the late Fox News Network chairman who fostered and allowed a culture of harassment to flourish at the network until he was exposed by former Fox anchor Gretchen Carlson, who sued him. Carlson won $20 million and an apology.
Jury selection in the Weinstein case began Tuesday. The trial is expected to last weeks.
As for his fear of being forgotten, Sivan said, he shouldn’t worry for a single moment.
“We will definitely remember him,” she said. “He put MeToo on the map, a movement that has taken over the country and the world. He has changed sexual harassment policies in workplaces around the nation, even in our own government. He has made it more effective and safe for people to report sexual harassment and abuse.”
Heck of a legacy, Harvey.

At 91, Dr. Ruth still has zest for life

Texto completo: ORLANDO, Fla. - I have questions for sex therapist Dr. Ruth, and my pulse quickens as I pick up the phone.
A busy signal.
Apparently Dr. Ruth K. Westheimer, who in the 1980s got Americans talking about everything from orgasms to orgies, still has a landline. Without call waiting.
The low-tech setup is probably designed to give the 91-year-old some peace - a defense against questions about masturbation, erectile dysfunction and other topics that before her radio show, television programs, newspaper columns and books were only whispered about, if they were spoken of at all.
"People find me in the street and tell me their problems," Westheimer says in her distinctive voice, high-pitched and German-accented. "But I'm grateful."
Westheimer's extraordinary life - from Holocaust survivor to Israeli sniper to household name - is detailed in Mark St. Germain's play, "Becoming Dr. Ruth." It opens at Orlando Shakes on Friday.
The play is what I have called to ask about - honestly! - but the good doctor has thoughts on today's sexual scene.
"The questions have changed," she says of those who seek her counsel. "They don't ask about premature ejaculation and how women can have an orgasm anymore. People know much more."
I suggest a whole generation knows more about their own bodies thanks to her teaching.
"I hope so," she proclaims. "There were others writing or talking about sex. But I certainly was a big part of it. And I was instrumental about talking about AIDS when no one else wanted to."
Her career in frank talk is how most people know her. When an actor first suggested to playwright St. Germain that the thrice-married diminutive doc would make a great subject for a play, he was skeptical.
"What? A 15-minute sketch about a talk show?" he remembers thinking. "Then I read about her life, and I was amazed."
But Westheimer wasn't interested.
"She said, 'Absolutely not,'" recalls St. Germain, whose acclaimed plays include "Freud's Last Session" and "Dancing Lessons." "I was kind of irritated. I felt too immediately dismissed."
Upon reflection, Westheimer had a change of heart. She liked St. Germain "right away." And she felt an obligation to those who didn't survive World War II.
"I have an obligation to talk about it," she says. "How lucky I am, how grateful I was saved. Hitler and the Nazis are dead. My four grandchildren are alive."
She says current affairs bring new resonance to her story.
"I want audiences to laugh but also to cry about the rise of Nazism, especially in today's world with anti-Semitism on the rise," she says.
Eileen DeSandre, an Oregon-based actor who stars in Orlando Shakes' production, says the play hits home for anyone who has faced trauma.
"She lost her family" when the youngster was put on a "Kindertransport," removing Jewish children from Nazi Germany to an orphanage in Switzerland, DeSandre said. "Her mother and grandmother took her to the train station, waved goodbye and she never saw them again."
Young Karola Ruth Siegel, as she was born, already had witnessed the Nazis dragging her father away.
After World War II, she emigrated to Palestine before the establishment of Israel. Because of her small stature, 4-foot-7, she was trained as a scout and a sniper in what would become the Israeli armed forces.
Israel is still important to her: She's proud that in May she'll receive an honorary doctorate from that nation's Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, where a psychology scholarship in her name is also being established (information at aabgu.org/Dr-Ruth). She laughs as she says she has a message for those who donate to the scholarship's endowment: "I promise they will have good sex for the rest of their lives."
After her stint in the Middle East, Westheimer lived in Paris before immigrating to the U.S. in 1956 and earning her master's and doctorate degrees. Even then, as a divorced woman she bucked convention.
"I was alive in the '50s, and you did not have single mothers in the '50s," DeSandre says. "But she was a single mother in the '50s without shame."
St. Germain says with Westheimer what you see is what you get: "I've never seen any personality but her real one."
The two became friends while he wrote the play. Then came the moment of truth.
"I had to read the whole thing to her," St. Germain says. "She only made two corrections - not about point of view, about locations I had wrong."
"Becoming Dr. Ruth" debuted in 2013, with The New York Times calling it "highly enjoyable" and "a design for living, as exemplified by a woman whose father told her always to be cheerful and happy."
Playing Westheimer is "a little terrifying," says DeSandre. "It's not an impersonation. It's not an imitation. It's an interpretation."
Westheimer won't travel from New York to see the local production. "I'll be teaching," she says; she lectures at Hunter College and Teachers College, Columbia University.
Her commitments don't surprise St. Germain. "She's unstoppable," he says. "She can walk faster than I can, she has more energy than I do."
And if she should need mobility assistance, Westheimer knows where to turn.
"I take a young, good-looking guy with me instead of a cane," Westheimer quips.

Technology serves as bully's pulpit Robocalls used to spew Rhodes' racist messages

Texto completo: It was Christmas Day in New York City, early evening, when a few phones in the empty offices at Columbia University and Barnard College began to ring.
What university employees found when they listened to their messages was a nearly two-minute diatribe filled with racist propaganda and hatred linked to the murder of a Barnard student. It came courtesy of our old pal Scott Rhodes, working his racist robocalls once again. Columbia described the calls as "abhorrent and viciously racist." A relatively mild example: "Remember to teach your children: Around blacks, never relax."
Rhodes was based for several years in Sandpoint, though he was said to have moved to Montana last year. Nevertheless, in much of the reporting on the case in New York City media, he is referred to as an Idaho resident and Road to Power as an Idaho-based "organization."
In truth, he's just one guy - one very small guy - using a technological megaphone to appear big. But he's established himself as an ugly echo of this region's history with racist groups whether he lives here anymore or not.
The Christmas calls were an attempt to peddle hatred on the back of the recent murder of a Barnard College freshman, who was stabbed during an attempted robbery by three middle-school classmates in a Manhattan park on Dec. 11.
The case is shocking in many ways - the suspects are 13 and 14, for one. Police have said it was not racially motivated, though the victim was white and the accused are black, according to news reports on the case.
Of course, for Rhodes, the rabid robocaller, there is a racial - or, rather, a racist - aspect to everything. The messages, which reportedly included aspersions cast against the victims' parents for allowing her to live among people of color, concluded by claiming to have been sent by Road to Power. That's the name for Rhodes' racist, anti-Semitic project, which pushes out robocalls across the nation and dwells in the sewers of the internet.
It's an amalgam of old tech and new, and Rhodes uses it to try to fuel white supremacist passions in the wake of news events he can twist toward his purposes.
The Anti-Defamation League says: "The calls, which have targeted communities in California, Idaho, Iowa, Florida, Georgia and Pennsylvania, seek to exploit current events by disseminating vile, offensive commentary."
A recent rise in this racist robocalling was the subject of reporting by former Spokesman-Review reporter Bill Morlin for the Southern Poverty Law Center in 2018. His story noted the calls are another tool relatively isolated racists have for amplifying their message - a "new, high-tech, computer-delivered brand of hate" that allows isolated individuals to amplify their message and appear to be a much larger movement than they actually are.
Rhodes came to public attention when he was found to have distributed white supremacist propaganda at Sandpoint High School in 2017. In online forums, according to the ADL, Road to Power has posted videos and commentary filled with hateful, racist speech and ideas; Rhodes has also seemingly watched the news with an eagle eye for chances to leap in with robocalls.
His calls have supported a neo-Nazi candidate in California, who he promised would rid America of "traitorous Jews." Those calls were targeted to 50 Jewish institutions in California, the ADL said.
Later, Road to Power sent out calls supporting a Holocaust denier running for office in California, as well. When Andrew Gillum, who is black, was running for governor of Florida, Road to Power targeted him with robocalls to Florida employing a minstrel voice and hooting monkeys while a speaker talks in an offensive dialect.
Rhodes targeted Stacey Abrams, an African American candidate for governor of Georgia, and Oprah Winfrey, who supported Abrams. He called for ethnic cleansing in calls to Charlottesville, Virginia, a year after the infamous Unite the Right rally. He praised police officers killing black men in calls to Pittsburgh, and raged against Latino Americans following a murder in Iowa, and on and on.
The New York murder is right up Rhodes' dark, filthy alley. Eighteen-year-old Tess Majors was stabbed several times by one young boy who was allegedly attempting to rob her with two others in a park near the Barnard College campus.
The robocalls went to faculty and staff offices - on many landlines at Barnard and a small number at Columbia. The two colleges share a campus and many connections, but are separate institutions. Officials said they did not believe students had received calls.
The New York Times reported on the message Dec. 27, including the claim of responsibility from Road to Power. Reporters there heard the message and confirmed its accuracy with sources, including law enforcement; I have not heard the message. College officials referred the matter to New York police, who have been circumspect.
A department spokesman responded to my request for an interview with a brief statement: "There is no place for hate or intolerance in New York City, or anywhere. The NYPD's Racial and Ethnically Motivated Extremism unit is aware of this incident and looking into the matter."
That unit - a newly formed team targeting threats and attacks from far-right and white supremacist organizations - might offer a new tool in the fight against extremist violence, and in finding the links between speech such as these robocalls, which are not illegal, and those who might act on them.
What's more likely is Rhodes will keep doing what he's doing, using the phone and the computer to amplify his sad, ignorant, small voice.
Raising voices of decency against him is a job that doesn't go away, no matter where he holes up next.

Texto completo: Review
'Like a Boss'
1/2
Credits: Directed by Miguel Arteta, starring Tiffany Haddish, Rose Byrne, Salma Hayak
Running time/rating: 1:23, R for coarse language, crude sexual material and drug use
"Like a Boss" is the perfect airplane movie - something that won't distract you terribly much while you work the New York Times crossword puzzle during a long flight periodically looking up at the screen when the 2-year-old in the seat behind you kicks the back of your chair.
Oh well. At least that way you won't fall asleep. In a warm movie theater with reclining lounge chairs, the risk of drifting off is far greater - which is, quite frankly, shocking considering this is a Tiffany Haddish movie.
With Rose Byrne, the normally hilarious Haddish plays the co-owner of a small, bricks-and-mortar cosmetics shop named, after the childhood best friends, Mel & Mia's.
You know, the kind of quaint, standalone boutique selling hand-mixed foundation and blush that is ground using a mortar and pestle - the kind of place that doesn't actually exist except onscreen.
Mel and Mia, $500,000 in debt, are miraculously bailed out by Claire Luna (Salma Hayek), a predatory makeup mogul who immediately - and predictably - begins driving a psychological wedge between the business partners playing Byrne's Mel (the money-minded one) off against Haddish's Mia (the creative one) so that Claire can assume a controlling interest in their company.
But the power of female friendship is too great in a movie that keeps hammering that point home between jokes about sex, marijuana and a baby shower cake with a doll's head emerging from what looks like an anatomically correct 3D model you'd find in an OB/GYN's office.
During a preview screening, the laughs were few and far between, even counting that cake scene. The roster of otherwise funny supporting actors - Billy Porter, Jennifer Coolidge, Karan Soni, Jimmy O. Yang - does little to leaven this flat loaf, which isn't just flavorless but half-baked.
Case in point: Mel and Mia's product that initially draws the attention of Claire, for instance, is a single-use makeup kit call the One Night Stand, which isn't just a dumb idea, but a wasteful one. As wasteful as the film is of its talent.
As for director Miguel Arteta, a filmmaker who, from his 1997 breakout, "Star Maps," to 2017's "Beatriz at Dinner," has never been afraid to be edgy, even transgressive, it's a mystery why he would make this film when Hollywood is full of no-name hacks willing to do the job.
True to its workplace-themed title, "Like a Boss" feels like a chore someone was handed. Perhaps oddest of all, Mel & Mia's company is all about selling makeup that doesn't hide a woman's natural beauty.
But "Boss" trowels on the clown white, strenuously reaching for nonexistent yuks instead of trusting in the talent of its likable but ill-used cast.

California's bid to toughen its trucking regulation is facing more roadblocks. A state judge says the state's new "gig-economy" law raising the bar for use of independent contractors doesn't apply to truck drivers, the WSJ Logistics Report's Jennifer Smith writes, ruling that the federal oversight built around interstate commerce preempts California's law . The ruling in a lawsuit involving port trucking operations joins another case in federal court that takes aim at the law known as AB-5. Both legal challenges have a long way to go, and the city of Los Angeles already says it will appeal the state court ruling. But Superior Court Judge William Highberger lays out detailed legal history in a ruling that state restrictions on business ties between contractor-drivers and trucking companies amount to prohibited economic regulation. Those arguments will get another airing next week as a separate case moves through federal court.
GOVERNMENT & REGULATION
The Trump administration is moving to speed up construction of highways and other infrastructure by streamlining environmental rules. The proposed regulatory overhaul faces a steep climb to enactment, the WSJ's Timothy Puko reports, with environmental groups promise to fight a plan that one official calls a "gift to the fossil-fuel industry." Business groups and construction unions counter that the effort will rein back a bureaucratic review process that can leave big projects in limbo for a decade or longer. The American Association of Port Authorities says it now takes three years to review plans to deepen shipping channels. The White House has its eyes on bigger projects, including bridges, highways and pipelines that are a backbone of energy networks. Cutting permit delays is a priority with a long history of bipartisan support, but battle lines will be drawn over the fine details of how the overhaul works.
SUPPLY CHAIN STRATEGIES
Sales results from the holiday season show the U.S. retail sector running on two very different tracks. J.C. Penney Co., Kohl's Corp. and Victoria's Secret parent L Brands Inc. all reported lower sales in the critical months of November and December, the WSJ's Suzanne Kapner reports, as Americans shifted their purchases online and to other retailers. Analysts say consumers clearly moved their shopping to Amazon.com Inc. and retail rivals such as T.J. Maxx and Target Corp. The winners in the bid for sales look to be those that have undertaken aggressive efforts to meet changing consumer buying patterns, including so-called omni-channel strategies that blend physical stores with e-commerce fulfillment. Walmart Inc. and Target have reported rising sales and store traffic as they have ramped up online ordering and in-store pickup services. But same-store sales at J.C. Penney fell 7.5% in the nine weeks ending Jan. 4.

Texto completo: LOS ANGELES -- Sue Lyon, the actress who was forever tied to her teenage portrayal of the title role in 1962's "Lolita," died Thursday in Los Angeles. The news was first reported by the New York Times, and no cause of death was immediately given. She was 73.
"How did they ever make a movie of 'Lolita' " asked the ads for the film, director Stanley Kubrick's adaptation of Vladimir Nabokov's controversial novel about a man in his 40s who becomes obsessed with a young girl. James Mason, Peter Sellers and Shelley Winters also starred in the film.
"From the first, she was interesting to watch," Kubrick was quoted as saying of Lyon in Look magazine. "Even in the way she walked in for her interview, casually sat down, walked out. She was cool and non-giggly. She was enigmatic without being dull. She could keep people guessing about how much Lolita knew about life."
Born July 10, 1946, in Davenport, Iowa, Lyon was just 14 years old and had had only a few minor screen credits when she was said to beat out more than 800 other young women for the part in "Lolita." Lyon would go on to win a Golden Globe award for most promising female newcomer for her performance.
In 1964, writing in The Times, Hedda Hopper declared, "Sue Lyon is the arch prototype of an instant star."
Lyon would go on to appear in John Huston's 1964 adaptation of Tennessee Williams's "The Night of the Iguana" and John Ford's 1966 drama "7 Women." She continued to act steadily throughout the 1960s and 1970s in both film and television. Her last screen credit was in 1980's "Alligator."
Lyon was married five times, to Hampton Fancher (who would go on to be a screenwriter on "Blade Runner"), Roland Harrison, Cotton Adamson, Edward Weathers and Richard Rudman.
Adamson was a convict for second degree murder and robbery in Colorado at the time of their marriage in 1973. When they divorced only a year later, Lyon was quoted as saying, "I've been told by people in the movie business, specifically producers and film distributors, that I can't get a job because I'm married to Cotton. Therefore, right now we can't be married."
Lyon had a daughter, Nona, from her marriage to Harrison.
In a 1967 interview with The Times promoting the Frank Sinatra-starring movie "Tony Rome," Lyon, then all of 20 years old, said, "To be pretty and to stay pretty are two different things... You can't take anything for granted, and it's foolish to think you can. You have to think ahead of how to build health and happiness. You have to learn to avoid what is going to hurt you or someone else."

Texto completo: Twenty minutes too late to spot the lead actor from a popular HBO series, I take a seat in Fore Street's bar room. The woman to my left and her boyfriend can't wait to tell me about him.
"He sat right where you are now. He and his girlfriend just sat down, and they literally did not talk the whole time," she says to me in breathy, hurried tones as she pulls out her phone to unveil the amateur paparazzi photos she snapped of the couple when they weren't paying attention.
There's Eric Dane (or someone who looks uncannily like him, his face partly obscured by the photographer's finger), scanning the evening's freshly printed menu. Look, there he is again, mouth open as a forkful of turnspit-roasted Quebec pork enters blurrily from the right of the frame.
In another half-hour, I'd be enjoying my own order of the herby pork sirloin ($28), one of executive chef Sam Hayward's signature dishes that - crusted with an electrifying coriander, juniper and black pepper rub - answers the unspoken question: What if Montreal steak seasoning were bumped up to first class?
And just like the actor who occupied my seat at the well-worn concrete bar, I can't speak as I eat. It isn't my choice, but my focus telescopes so that all I can think about is the plate in front of me.
Mea culpa to the bartender: I genuinely didn't hear you ask if I wanted another ramekin of whipped salted butter for the torn remains of the quartered Standard Baking baguette in front of me. Time and again that evening and during a repeat visit a few days later, I kept losing track of my surroundings.
I swear I wasn't being rude - just blissfully preoccupied by my meal.
Considering that Fore Street turns 24 this coming year, that's a remarkable statement. Co-owners Dana Street and Sam Hayward have, for more than an entire generation, through all of the rapid phases of evolution that have seen Maine blossom into a real culinary destination, maintained their staunch commitment to seasonal menus driven by local suppliers.
The entire staff seems to understand the centrality of this ethos. Cooks and servers alike can tell you precisely which farms produce most components of your meal, even when they are sourced ... rather unusually. When I ask head chef Daniel Young to tell me about the squash used in a phenomenal buttery puree served alongside an undercooked wood-grilled pollock ($28), he laughs as he confesses, "It's some kind of heirloom squash. I'm not saying that because I forgot the name, but Frank Gross doesn't know the name of it either. He's a farmer who has been growing food for Sam and for Fore Street for over 20 years. We never order any food from him. He just shows up with whatever came out of his field, and we buy it because it's good."
Not knowing what's coming in to your kitchen makes menu planning a challenge, which is why Fore Street's chefs improvise, rewriting the menu every day. That's no exaggeration: Two days after my first visit, I returned to find components of many dishes tweaked, some eliminated, and at least three new menu items added to the list. Every meal is like dipping your toes into the currents of Heraclitus' famous river: You'll never have precisely the same experience twice.
"Our dynamic ability to write the menu every day is beautiful, special and unique," said Young, who until early this year helmed kitchens for celebrity chef Michael Symon. "It forces you to think and approach the food new every day. You could never come in and just phone it in. The versatility of changing the menu causes happy accidents, which is one of the reasons why I say it's the most interesting restaurant I've ever eaten at or been a part of."
Hayward and Street are no strangers to praise. In addition to Hayward's 2004 "Best New Chef: Northeast" award from the James Beard Foundation, Fore Street has often been showcased in Maine travel guides and food-focused profiles of Portland. Five years ago, this paper's then-reviewer swooned over the restaurant's "always changing but always extraordinary menu" and "wood space that never seems too crowded or too empty." I could have written much of that five-star review today.
Take pastry chef Peter Robbins' oversized caramel pot de crÃ¨me, spiced with star anise, capped with a torched dollop of bittersweet, marshmallowy Italian meringue and plated with a pair of snappy molasses cookies that judder with clove and cinnamon ($11). Had I tasted this dish just a week earlier, before my filing deadline, it would have topped my list of the best desserts I ate in 2019.
Robbins' chocolate-mousse-topped dacquoise of walnuts, hazelnuts and pecans ($11) wouldn't have trailed far behind, although the plate's true scene-stealer is an exquisite scoop of ice cream made by steeping cream with star anise, vanilla and hunks of snowy coconut meat.
Not everything at Fore Street is perfect. In addition to the underdone (and aggressively salted) wood-roasted Gulf of Maine pollock I mentioned, service occasionally grows absent-minded, especially if you dine late. On my second visit, one of the floor's servers kept abandoning his tables to report scores from a Patriots game to his colleagues. At one stage, a woman from his section stood up and waved him down with a napkin.
Still, it is a small miracle that a restaurant as old as Fore Street can count its minor lapses on one hand. And for every one of them, a countervailing triumph more than balances the scale.
On my first visit, it was a side order of carrots from Goranson Farm in Dresden ($8) that won my heart: steamed until al dente, then blasted in the raging wood oven. As their miniature cast-iron pan is retrieved from the flames, the oblique-cut, blistered French Bolero carrots get tossed in a coriander-orange vinaigrette and freckled with locally foraged sumac.If you're after a less-expensive way to enjoy Fore Street, this is your ticket. Order the carrots and a glass of the lemony Torbreck Barossa Valley Semillon ($11), and you'll leave satisfied, yet not stuffed, and just $25 lighter after tax and tip.
Indeed, light (and less costly), mostly plant-based meals are easy to assemble at Fore Street, even in the winter. That's due in no small part to Hayward and Street's enduring relationships with local farmers willing to dedicate valuable hoop house real estate to greens like succulent winter purslane (aka miner's lettuce) from Bowdoinham's Dandelion Spring Farm.
In the Northern Spy apple salad ($15), a generous thicket of the delicately tart greens get a drizzle of aged balsamic, olive oil and finely rasped, field-frozen ginger preserved in rice wine vinegar. The inflammatory tartness of the dressing and sweetness from crunchy fruit and fire-roasted parsnips conspire to create a fascinating illusion: You'll taste cranberries, even though there are none on the plate.
Believe me, I searched for them, dislodging candied hazelnuts from the salad's summit and teasing apart crimson radicchio from miner's lettuce. I must have spent 15 minutes alternating small bites with bewildered rummaging through the contents of my plate. My server mentioned later that he came by to ask how the salad was, but I didn't even notice. I was, once again, happily transfixed.

Texto completo: The Washington Post
Millions of smartphone users globally got an unpleasant surprise this holiday season. ToTok, one of those "free, fast and secure" messaging apps they used to chat with family and friends, was a spying tool designed by the government of the United Arab Emirates. Americans ought to be alarmed by the news, but they also ought to be alarmed by something else: Our private data isn't actually private, either.
The New York Times obtained a cache of location information from 12 million phones that combine together for 50 billion geographic pings. Each phone user is captured by thousands of dots on a map that, when connected, reveal the most intimate details of his or her day-to-day life. Seemingly innocent apps, from jewel-swapping games to weather services, soak up our movements and sell them to brokers who in turn sell them to advertisers. The entire enterprise is completely legal.
That a massive market for location data exists isn't a revelation, but viewing so vast a collection of information in so concentrated a place still is revelatory. The Times was able to track Inau guration Day protesters, follow scientists at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, trace a Post journalist through Arlington, Virginia and even travel in President Donald Trump's digital footprints as he lounged at Mar-a-Lago and golfed at his club in Jupiter, Florida.
The data was safe in the Times's hands, but what about the hands of an enemy state seeking to blackmail an intelligence operative, or an abusive husband trying to find his fleeing wife? And what about the idea of ambient privacy - our ability to move through the world without the knowledge that someone, somewhere, is always watching?
Many have used the Times report to call for the regulation of location data, which, as the paper's analysis makes manifest, can never be truly anonymized. They're right to ask for that, but they should ask for more along with it: a comprehensive privacy framework that looks beyond a single category to restrict how companies collect, keep, process and share our personal information.
That framework should put an emphasis on what data companies reasonably need to gather (much less sell) to provide a service, rather than what data they'd like to collect to fill their coffers.
The Times's project and those that have come before it reveal that it doesn't take a plot by a repressive regime to get people to surrender to surveillance. It takes only pages on pages of opaque terms of service and a legal landscape free of restraints. Perhaps if members of Congress could see their own thousands of dots moving across a map, they would finish the work they started more than a year ago and produce the robust law the country deserves.

The right move: Count all Floridians

Texto completo: A Times editorial

Better late than never. Gov. Ron DeSantis announcement this week of a new statewide committee to work to ensure every Floridian is counted in the 2020 census is a step in the right direction. Getting an accurate count is vital for the state, and it should not be a partisan issue. While Florida is significantly behind other states in preparing for the census, it is not too late to start making up for lost time.

DeSantis appointed Lt. Gov. Jeanette Nunez as chair of the statewide Complete Count Committee. Its members include representatives from the business community, minority groups, veterans and others who can help spread the word about the census and its importance. The statewide committee should work closely with similar local committees that are working in Pinellas County and elsewhere to encourage everyone to participate.

The census occurs just once every decade, and it matters. The population numbers will determine how many seats Florida gets in the U.S. House (an expected two additional seats). It determines how the federal government allocates funds to states for health care programs and other needs. And the census information isnt just used by the government. Private businesses use it to spot population and demographic trends that help them decide whether to expand or relocate.

Its been a bumpy road to get this far on the census. The Trump administration pushed for months to add a question about citizenship, which would have discouraged some immigrants from participating in the census because of fears of being deported. The U.S. Supreme Court eventually derailed that effort last year, and the administration ran out of time to make a new push to add the question before the census forms were printed.

Even without the citizenship issue, there are concerns that Florida and other states with high numbers of African Americans and non-white Hispanics could end up with artificially low counts. The census is relying more than ever on self-reporting in an era when fewer people respond to surveys, and blacks and Hispanics more often lack reliable Internet service compared to white residents. The Tampa Bay Times also has found that records such as voter registration and property records that census workers use to find people are more comprehensive for white people.

Other states have been far more aggressive than Florida in trying to meet those challenges. California and 25 other states are collectively spending several hundred million dollars to try to improve census response rates in their states, the New York Times has reported. Most of those states spending money on census efforts are headed by Democratic governors, and most of the states that are not spending money on it are headed by Republican governors.

There should not be anything partisan about getting an accurate population count, and states that do not try to ensure every resident is counted are only hurting themselves. Fortunately, DeSantis has seen the light. The new statewide committee should get to work and coordinate with local efforts  and the governor should scrape up some money to make sure this is a vigorous effort. It would be a prudent investment that would pay off many times over in the long run.

Texto completo: Alex Hairston has a gift for portraying singers.
In the touring company of "Motown: The Musical," she was Florence Ballard -- a member of the Supremes whose tragic life was the inspiration for the Effie White character in "Dreamgirls." In the Broadway production of "Beautiful: The Carole King Musical," Hairston was a performer in another 1960s girl group, the Shirelles.
And in "Summer: The Donna Summer Musical," which begins performances Wednesday at the Fox Theatre, she's one of three singers who bring the iconic pop diva to life.
In preparing to step into Summer's shoes, Hairston says, "I definitely listened to a lot of her records and a lot of her interviews, while keeping a bit of (myself) in the role. 
"I'm not necessarily trying to re-create Donna Summer, but more to honor her and her legacy."
A native of North Carolina who has family in Jennings and Belleville, Hairston began acting as a child, appearing in commercials and, at age 12, alongside the popular purple dinosaur in the home video production "Barney: The Land of Make Believe." 
"I didn't discover musical theater until my late teenage years, which is kind of late," Hairston says. "But I just loved it so much that I took as many classes as I could." She earned a bachelor's degree from Western Carolina University, majoring in musical theater with a minor in dance.
Before arriving on Broadway, Hairston landed cruise line gigs in shows including "Priscilla, Queen of the Desert" and "Legally Blonde: The Musical" and stints in regional theater including a role in "Hairspray." Her current role is just the latest in a promising career trajectory. 
It was just about inevitable that Summer, a phenomenally successful singer-songwriter who died of cancer in 2012 at age 63, would inspire a Broadway musical. Although she was most closely identified with dance and R&B music, she also left her mark on rock, gospel and even torch songs.
But the singer -- who was born LaDonna Adrian Gaines on Dec. 31, 1948, in Boston -- is most fondly remembered for irresistible calls to get up and dance that served as a soundtrack to the 1970s and '80s. Summer not only experienced huge commercial success -- with three double albums in a row ("Live and More," "Bad Girls" and "On the Radio: Greatest Hits Volumes I & II") reaching No. 1 on the charts in the late 1970s -- but also earned multiple Grammy Awards.
"She was definitely a trailblazer," Hairston says. "With the help of her producers, she did pretty much create disco as a music genre. And she was incredibly fearless in her career. She wasn't afraid to try something new."
In the "Summer" touring ensemble, the woman who shook up radio with the risquÃ© "Love to Love You Baby" is split into three personalities: the mature Diva Donna (Dan'yelle Williamson), the preteen Duckling Donna (Olivia Elease Hardy) and the version that Hairston embodies, the late teen and 20-something Disco Donna.
With a book by Colman Domingo, Robert Cary and director Des McAnuff, "Summer: The Donna Summer Musical" premiered at the La Jolla Playhouse in San Diego in November 2017 and opened on Broadway in April 2018. A jukebox musical, it showcases Summer hits including "Bad Girls," "Hot Stuff," "I Feel Love," "Last Dance," "Love to Love You Baby," "MacArthur Park," "On the Radio" and "She Works Hard for the Money."
The show, which closed on Broadway in December 2018 after 298 performances, was nominated for two Tony Awards: best performance by a leading actress in a musical (LaChanze) and best performance by a featured actress in a musical (Ariana DeBose). 
While praising the "exciting vocalism" of LaChanze, DeBose and Storm Lever, the New York Times chided the show for reducing "the late Queen of Disco and pioneer of electronica to a few factoids and song samples that make her seem profoundly inconsequential."
But BroadwayWorld was enthusiastic about the touring production, observing that Hairston, Williamson and Hardy "give compelling and authentic acting performances, capturing both the highs and lows of Donna Summer's tumultuous life and career."
The role of Disco Donna is at once gratifying and challenging, Hairston says. 
"I have the privilege of singing most of her top hits," she says. "It's wonderful, it's terrifying and it's so much fun."

'The Book' celebrates 26 years

Texto completo: 'Rule number one," John Berendt wrote about Savannah social life in his iconic 1994 book, "Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil." "Always stick around for one more drink. That's when things happen. That's when you find out everything you want to know."
Berendt followed his own advice and learned more than he ever expected about life, death, scandal and intrigue in Savannah. Exactly 26 years ago Monday, Berendt published "Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil" to unexpected and overwhelming popular success.
Graced with a moody black-and-white cover photo by the late Savannah photographer Jack Leigh, "Midnight" celebrated the undeniable quirkiness of life in the Hostess City. The book's incredible success bathed the city in a white-hot media spotlight and shaped its future for decades to come.
Tourism explosion
To many Savannahians, "Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil" - which dominated the New York Times bestseller list for a record-setting 216 weeks - will forever be known simply as "The Book." In many ways, life in the Coastal Empire can be divided into "before The Book" and "after The Book."
By any measure, the success of Berendt's book was a pivotal point in Savannah's history. Once "The Book" exploded on the national and international stage, the world simply could not get enough of Savannah. Some local residents loved the attention and the tourist dollars that rolled in.
Savannah's tourism industry grew into a powerhouse, attracting a growing number of visitors to Georgia's First City each year. Once-empty storefronts on Broughton Street filled with businesses. Savannah's star rose, and the city became hotter - and cooler - than ever before.
In 1994, Savannah attracted 5 million visitors to the city, who spent approximately $630 million. In 2018, the city hosted 14.5 million visitors, who spent more than $3 billion. When "Midnight" was published, Savannah had 7,500 hotel rooms. Today, the number of area hotel rooms exceeds 20,000 and is still climbing.
A Southern 'hothouse'
Ostensibly written as a nonfiction suspense story about a notable Savannah murder, "Midnight" featured real-life eccentrics rendered in Southern gothic style and was full of evocative descriptions. Berendt's cast of characters included a wise-cracking drag queen, a self-proclaimed voodoo priestess and a steamy portrayal of high society.
Berendt described the Hostess City as a quirky, one-of-a-kind social greenhouse, writing: "For me, Savannah's resistance to change was its saving grace. The city looked inward, sealed off from the noises and distractions of the world at large. It grew inward, too, and in such a way that its people flourished like hothouse plants tended by an indulgent gardener. The ordinary became extraordinary. Eccentrics thrived. Every nuance and quirk of personality achieved greater brilliance in that lush enclosure than would have been possible anywhere else in the world."
Three years after the publication of Berendt's book, Clint Eastwood directed the "Midnight" movie with Kevin Spacey and John Cusack in leading roles. Shot on location in Savannah, the 1997 film celebrated the city's lush beauty and remained faithful to Berendt's book.
In honor of the 26th anniversary of "Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil," read a few passages from this iconic book and toast Berendt, an acclaimed author who redefined Savannah's future by telling an unforgettable story about its past.

Anti-Trump Christians forget the past

Texto completo: The battle between church and state is as old as church and state, as is the conflict within religious circles over who supposedly speaks for God.
The latest dust-up occurred after the departing editor of Christianity Today magazine, Mark Galli, wrote an editorial in which he said President Donald Trump is an immoral man and his impeachment by the House is cause for his immediate removal from office.
This ignited a firestorm. Major media, which regularly ignore the opinions of religious publications, overnight transported Mr. Galli from relative obscurity to national prominence. Anti-Trump evangelicals called his comments a breath of fresh air.
More like stale political air.
During the debate over slavery in America, pro- and anti-slavery clergy selectively quoted scripture to President Abraham Lincoln to justify their positions. Lincoln responded to the contradictory arguments of North and South in his second inaugural address: "Both read the same Bible and pray to the same God; and each invokes His aid against the other."
Scripture, which conservative evangelicals claim is inerrant and infallible, contains stories of leaders with severe moral flaws, whom God used for His own purposes. Those who want Mr. Trump removed from office and can't wait until the next election for voters to decide, ignore one of the most profound verses about temporal power: "Everyone must submit to governing authorities. For all authority comes from God, and those in positions of authority have been placed there by God." (Romans 13:1 NLT)
If "everyone" and "all" doesn't mean everyone and all, including people for whom some evangelicals did not vote, pray tell what does it mean?
Mr. Galli and other anti-Trumpers don't tell us their presidential preferences. One hopes it isn't any of those on the far left who have an agenda that evangelicals would consider an abomination. President Trump is right when he says he has done more to advance evangelical concerns than any other president.
What the anti-Trump forces are uncomfortable with are the resumes of people who voted for and still support the president. They are not part of the elites. They didn't go to the "right" universities where truth is subjective, if it exists at all. They don't read The New York Times, or The Washington Post or watch CNN and MSNBC. They watch Fox News and listen to Rush Limbaugh. They are tired of being treated like second-class citizens who don't deserve to have their principles upheld by a government to which they pay taxes.
I recently spoke about the Galli editorial with a former Democratic member of Congress, who is a Christian. He said one of the problems with uncritical evangelical support for the president is that it dilutes their "witness" to non-believers, who think faith in God means having to join the Republican Party and support the president.
What would their position have been had Hillary Clinton, a liberal Methodist, been elected president? Do they believe they would have been in a better position to share their faith?
People have always used such excuses for not pursuing faith, but my friend does have a point. When non-churchgoers (who are increasing in numbers, especially among the young) see people they think should be preaching about another kingdom and another King selectively ignore a leader's moral failings, they justify their unbelief.
On the other hand, anti-Trump Christians must answer this question: Would they be happier if a liberal Democrat were president, one who supports abortion and the rest of the secular-progressive social agenda and sees the Constitution as a "living document" to be interpreted by individual judges? That was the choice in 2016.
The same choice is likely in November. Such a "preferred" Democrat might be morally upright and even attend church every Sunday.
Apparently, they forget we have already had such a president. His name is Jimmy Carter.

Jet hit by iran missile; 176 died in accident near Tehran after attacks on U.S. bases

Texto completo: Iran shot down a Ukrainian passenger jet by accident earlier this week, killing all 176 people on board, American, Canadian and British officials said Thursday, a tragic discovery that comes in the wake of the U.S. killing of the Islamic nation's top general.
The doomed plane crashed shortly after taking off from Tehran's airport early Wednesday local time - just hours after Iran had fired a barrage of ballistic missiles at two U.S. airbases in Iraq in retaliation for President Trump's decision to order the Jan. 3 killing of Gen. Qassem Soleimani.
The cause of the devastating crash remained unknown for nearly two days, but four U.S. officials said late Thursday it's "highly likely" that Iran mistook the plane for a threat in the immediate aftermath of its retaliatory assaults on the Ain al-Asad and Irbil military bases in Iraq, where American troops are housed.
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, whose country lost at least 63 citizens in the crash, backed up those anonymous assertions.
"We have intelligence from multiple sources including our allies and our own intelligence," Trudeau said at a press conference in Toronto. "The evidence indicates that the plane was shot down by an Iranian surface-to-air missile."
British Prime Minister Boris Jonhson confirmed the same.
"There is now a body of information that the flight was shot down by an Iranian surface-to-air missile," Johnson said.
Speaking at an unrelated White House event, Trump said he believes Iran was responsible, without citing evidence.
"Somebody could have made a mistake on the other side," he said, adding the Ukrainian plane was flying over a "pretty rough neighborhood."
The president continued, "Some people say it was mechanical. I personally don't think that's even a question."
It was not immediately clear how the U.S. or its allies would respond to the intelligence assessments, which were unveiled one day after Trump toned down the warmongering rhetoric and said he wanted to pursue "peace" with Iran despite killing its top general.
A video of the plane crash obtained by The New York Times shows what appears to be a missile lifting from the ground before a ball of fire erupts in the sky. The apparent plane is then seen trailing off in a different direction as an explosion flares.
But Iranian officials disputed the Western intelligence, saying the crash could not have been caused by any military action.
"This is ridiculous," Iranian armed forces spokesman Abolfazl Shekarchi was quoted as telling state media. "Most of the passengers on this flight were our valued young Iranian men and women. Whatever we do, we do it for the protection and defense of our country and our people."
An initial Iranian investigative report found the pilot of the Ukrainian International Airlines Boeing 737-800 jet never made a radio call for help, but tried to turn back to the airport after the apparent strike.
In emergencies, pilots are taught to reach out to air-traffic controllers immediately to warn them and to clear the runway, though the first priority is to keep the aircraft flying.
Ukraine, meanwhile, said it considered a missile strike as one of several possible theories for the crash, including a hit by a Russian-made Tor missile.
"Undoubtedly, the priority for Ukraine is to identify the causes of the plane crash. We will surely find out the truth," said Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.
Russia delivered 29 Tor-M1s to Iran in 2007.
Iran first blamed a technical malfunction for the crash, a claim initially backed by Ukrainian officials before they said they wouldn't speculate amid an ongoing investigation.
The Ukrainian jet took off at 6:12 a.m. Wednesday local time. It gained altitude heading west, reaching nearly 8,000 feet before plummeting, according to both the report and flight-tracking data.
Witnesses, including the the crew of another flight passing above it, described seeing the plane engulfed in flames before crashing at 6:18 a.m., the Iranian report said.
Flight-tracking data for the plane cut off just before the crash, which occurred in the town of Shahedshahr to the northeast of the plane's last reported position.
Both of the so-called "black boxes" that contain data and cockpit communications from the plane had been recovered, though they sustained damage and some parts of their memory was lost, according to the report.
Ukrainian investigators that arrived in Iran early Thursday were not immediately given permission to examine the crash site.
The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board is in talks with the State and Treasury Departments about traveling to Iran to inspect the crash on the grounds that the aircraft was American-made.

Texto completo: When Louisiana State completed a rare victory over Alabama in November, my sister, Irene Cloud, kissed her tiger-striped fingernails. Then she pressed her hand to LSU coach Ed Orgeron's face on her television, which had been sprinkled with holy water for good luck.\ \ "He's so cute; I love him so much," Melissa Landry, a family friend, said in a video of the victory celebration at Irene's home in Lafayette, Louisiana.
"The Cajun Cookie Monster!" yelled Sarah Davenport, Irene's daughter and my niece.
"He does not speak English at all," Landry laughed.
Orgeron's raspy voice is similar to bayou voices they have heard their entire lives but more gravelly, like the sound of tires on an oyster shell parking lot. Scratch that. It is the sound of a fiddle being played with a chain saw.
"We finally have a coach without an accent," Irene likes to say.
All kidding aside, as LSU faces Clemson in college football's national championship game Monday in New Orleans, a sensitive subject lurks beneath the good-natured jibes about Orgeron's voice.
The Cajuns of south Louisiana, descended from French-speaking Acadians who were expelled from Canada in the 1750s for refusing to pledge fealty to the British, have long endured media portrayals as a people whose distinct accent makes them seem backward and ignorant.
Exhibit No. 1: Adam Sandler's witless character in the football comedy "The Waterboy."
"You were laughing at that character; nobody's laughing at Coach Orgeron now," said Shane K. Bernard, a Louisiana historian and author of "The Cajuns: Americanization of a People."
The success of Orgeron, 58, from tiny Larose, La., southwest of New Orleans, has provided an athletic and cultural rebuttal to ridiculing vocal stereotypes of Cajuns, who otherwise have been embraced for their food, music and hospitality.
"A lot of Cajuns can't understand him, either," Emily Davenport, my niece and Sarah's sister, said with a laugh. "But true LSU fans, now we get it. It's like a secret language. And we love it."
That was not always a prevailing opinion. In the World War I era, Louisiana tried to smother its French heritage by assimilating Cajuns into the broader American culture. The state constitution of 1921 required that public schools teach in English only. When my father attended school in the 1930s and '40s in Eunice, Louisiana, he and others caught speaking the Cajun French dialect were sometimes paddled or forced to kneel in uncooked rice that bruised the knees.
Even into the 1950s and early '60s, said Barry Jean Ancelet, a renowned folklorist and emeritus professor at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, there were reports of French-speaking schoolchildren wetting their pants because "they didn't know how to ask for permission to go to the bathroom in English and they weren't allowed to in French."
Not until 1968 did a formal, belated attempt begin to preserve the French language and the Cajun culture. As a coach, Orgeron has faced mocking suspicion that equated his accent with a lack of intelligence and sophistication. When he struggled as the coach of Mississippi from 2005 to '07, a parody song reduced his vocabulary to "Yaw yaw yaw yaw football."
Many LSU fans considered his hiring as head coach in 2016 to be the desperate signing of a shrimp boat captain instead of a master football strategist.
LSU football has long served as a measure of achievement in a state that has struggled with poverty, educational achievement, cancer rates, infant mortality and political chicanery. Rudy Penton, an inveterate LSU fan who has been known to paint purple and gold tiger stripes on his dogs, told me years ago, "When we're No. 1, it's usually for something bad."
Orgeron, though, represents characteristics that Cajuns hold dearest: resilience, innovation, hard work, pride in their heritage, lightheartedness combined with seriousness of purpose.
Mine is a family of LSU grads. A sports writer for 40-plus years, I still follow LSU football with avid interest but not emotion. My mother, sister and two nieces, though, maintain a passion as spicy as sauce piquante.
During the Alabama game, Irene hosted her granddaughter's birthday party, complete with a baby's cheerleader outfit, a cake designed as a football field, invites shaped as tickets and an LSU-themed bouncy castle. She bought tickets for her daughters to attend Monday's game. And she will be watching at home with her usual accouterments -- holy water, an LSU jersey and a costume tiger head.
"We love us some Coach O," Irene said. "A lot of smart people talk with a funny accent."

Texto completo: Vaughan Oliver, a British graphic designer whose album covers for independent record label 4AD became visual accompaniments to influential alternative rock bands like Pixies, the Breeders and Cocteau Twins, died Sunday in London. He was 62.
His death was confirmed by a spokesman for 4AD, who did not specify the cause.
Oliver grew up immersed in rock music and intrigued by album cover art. After studying design, he knew that he wanted to make artwork that was a fitting accompaniment to the music on an album.
"I always wanted to design sleeves as a kid," he said in an interview with online magazine Designboom. "Record sleeves are ephemeral, and I always wanted to make them more than that."
Oliver began designing album covers for 4AD after meeting Ivo Watts-Russell, who founded the label with Peter Kent in 1980, at a party in London. He formed a design partnership called 23 Envelope with photographer Nigel Grierson in 1983. After he parted ways with Grierson in 1988 he kept working for 4AD, collaborating with Chris Bigg and other artists under the studio name v23.
4AD became known for releasing music that did not conform to mainstream expectations, and Oliver's cover designs helped catch the eyes of record store browsers who might not have heard of the label's artists. Each of his illustrations was informed by the band's music, and therefore they were quite diverse, but they shared a surrealist sensibility.
"My goal was always to turn music into an object, granting it a physical dimension," Oliver said in an interview with online publication O Magazine.
Oliver and his studio partners designed a cover with a ghostly lace photograph for the Cocteau Twins' celestial album "Treasure" (1984) and doused a Valentine's Day heart with what looked like blood on a brilliant green and red background for the cover of the Breeders' "Last Splash" (1993), an album that began as a side project for Pixies bassist Kim Deal and Throwing Muses guitarist Tanya Donnelly.
His designs for Pixies, a jarring indie rock band from Boston that inspired later alternative groups, included a sepia photo of a topless flamenco dancer for "Surfer Rosa" (1988); a red, ringed Earth for the cover of "Bossanova" (1990); and a photograph of a monkey with a halo overlaid with a geometric design and surrounded by numbers for "Doolittle" (1989).
"I simply tried, all through my career, to create a different identity for each band I worked with," Oliver said. "Creating feelings or aesthetic moods derived from the music, from the texture and atmosphere the music itself already had. You would only get that thanks to a close collaboration and many conversations with the band in particular."
Among the other 4AD artists for whom Oliver designed covers were This Mortal Coil, Lush, TV on the Radio and Scott Walker. A memorial on the label's website said that "without Vaughan, 4AD would not be 4AD," adding that "his style also helped to shape graphic design in the late 20th century."
Vaughan William Oliver was born in Sedgefield, County Durham, England, on Sept. 12, 1957, to Doreen (Tindale) and Ernest Oliver. His father was a mining surveyor. He grew up in Newton Aycliffe, also in County Durham, before earning a bachelor's degree in graphic design at what is now Northumbria University in Newcastle upon Tyne in 1979.
Soon after that he moved to London, where he connected with Watts-Russell and began his long collaboration with 4AD.
"We somehow managed to compliment and bolster each other in our mission to transcend mediocrity," Watts-Russell wrote in a personal remembrance on the label's site.
His first work for the label was in 1980 for the Modern English single "Gathering Dust," and his last was in 2018 for a 30th-anniversary reissue of two Pixies records. He also designed cover art for the band Bush and for music by filmmaker David Lynch. He had international showings of his art, taught design and worked with commercial clients like Microsoft, Sony and L'Oreal.
He is survived by his wife, Lee Widdows, with whom he lived in Surrey, England; two sons, Beckett and Callum; and a sister, Alison Oliver.
Oliver said that he thought cover art remained an important complement to music, even though digital music formats have largely made physical albums obsolete.
"The cover, even if it has no physical presence, is another music tool," he said. "That's why there are still covers today that are very ... true. Any cover capturing and expressing the state of mind of the music it represents is true."

Texto completo: Look to Corinthians in
First Presbyterian dispute
I was very sad to read yet again about First Presbyterian Church of Bethlehem's need to go to court about expenditures that were made several years ago by elected officials of that church. The Rev. J.C. Austin maintains that he is not accusing anyone of wrongdoing, yet he believes there is no choice but to rely on the courts to understand how the money was used, even though they have in their possessions hundreds, if not thousands, of documents explaining expenditures.
I would like to suggest that there is another way of dealing with the issue, one that is clearly explained by the apostle Paul in the Bible, in 1 Corinthians chapter 6 to be exact. [It begins: "If any of you has a dispute with another, do you dare to take it before the ungodly for judgment instead of before the Lord's people?"]
I would hope that pastor Austin and his congregation would read that passage and act accordingly.

Help save migratory birds threatened by project
The New York Times reported on Dec. 25 about a construction project in Virginia that is threatening the nesting grounds of 25,000 migratory birds in the Chesapeake, including gulls, black skimmers, royal terns and other seabirds. This project, the Hampton Road Bridge Tunnel Expansion, is underway and will include the addition of twin two-lane tunnels west of the existing eastbound tunnel as well as additional highway construction.
Currently, this is proceeding with no alternative habitat planning in place. Nor is one required. Existing loopholes have eliminated any criminal penalties.
The American Bird Conservancy (abcbirds.org) is hoping to campaign state officials regarding the creation of alternative habitat. Please consider contacting them to lend support. Concerns pertaining to this project can be directed to the Virginia Department of Transportation (bit.ly/2R155sr) and the Virginia Governor's Office (bit.ly/2TaoUAa). The Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries may be reached at bit.ly/2uz22jG.
Public input is critical and timely. Officials need to be urged to be environmentally responsible. We cannot afford to continually forge ahead without, in good conscience, making every possible effort to be good stewards of this planet.

Trump, like Vince Lombardi, produces a winner
President Trump, admire or detest him, has turned our country into a front-runner. Reminds me of what Henry Jordan of the Green Bay Packers once said about coach Vince Lombardi, "Lombardi treats us all the same, like dogs." And what team was more successful than the Packers?
So my advice to all those who detest this president. Learn to bark.

We should stop wars and
focus on climate change
The U.S. assassination of Iranian General Qasem Soleimani at Baghdad Airport continues the insanity of war over power and fossil fuel resources. So many have died in the past four U.S. administrations as a result of the invasions of Kuwait and then Iraq. Families torn apart here and there for no good purpose. We can add the suffering in Yemen and Syria as collateral and continuing debacles.
The U.S. Department of State has told all U.S. citizens in Iraq to leave immediately. Such good advice - include all U.S. military personnel in that. Any leader should be getting us out as a force of conflict, using international diplomacy with other regional leaders, and focusing on the immediate threat to all our lives: the climate crisis here and worldwide.
We owe our kids citizen action to end costly militarism and to end the carbon emissions that are altering weather and burning up the planet.

A resolution to listen
more, argue less
I have never been more passionate about an issue than climate change. So passionate, in fact, that it has made it difficult to talk about it with other people without getting defensive, even with my own mother, who shares many of the same views.
So I made a New Year's resolution: to have an open conversation once a day with someone about climate change by posing a simple question, "What do you think about climate change?" But then, instead of assuming that they are against me or trying to convince them of my view, I will genuinely listen to their experience until I learn at least one thing about them.
The first conversation happened this week. A man at the gym told me he didn't know what to think because the media presents two polar opposite political opinions, but he knows something must be happening because the pollution is so bad. I pointed him toward sources that present just the facts from climate scientists, such as the Union of Concerned Scientists.
It felt freeing to have a real, open conversation in which I just listened. Please start the conversation with someone today. We urgently need everyone's help to address climate change.

U.S. should not
threaten cultural sites
In some ways, the Taliban's destruction of religious and cultural sites in Afghanistan was among their most abhorrent acts.
Now President Trump is contemplating the same thing in Iran.
Shame.

Questions remain about
killing of Soleimani
The Pentagon and Trump claim there was a plot developing to kill American citizens and that is the reason the U.S. killed Iranian Gen. Qasem Soleimani. If that's the case then yes, it was a justified assassination without engaging Congress.
However, with all the lies told by Trump and his administration, this is an example of a time where you have to ask yourself: Is he being truthful? And why, suddenly, does Trump believe his intelligence agencies, the same agencies he ignored, discounted and ridiculed so many times?
Why wasn't the Gang of Eight brought together and informed of Trump's impending action? That would have given some legitimacy to his claim there was an "imminent" threat.

Teach, study, work out, repeat: Pawlowski serves prison time In first year at low-security facility in Conn., says he keeps busy, stays in shape

Texto completo: Spin class. Learning Arabic. Consuming every book in the law library.
This self-improvement regimen isn't part of a New Year's resolution. It's how ex-Allentown Mayor Ed Pawlowski is occupying his time in prison.
Pawlowski, 54, Allentown's mayor for more than a decade, was sentenced to 15 years behind bars in 2018 for a pay-to-play corruption scandal that traded city contracts for campaign donations. He has been serving time at Federal Correctional Institution Danbury, a low-security prison camp in Connecticut, since December 2018, when he was transferred there from a federal holding facility in Philadelphia.
During his first year in prison, Pawlowski said, he has maintained a busy schedule including drumming in several bands, teaching a class on government and studying federal law, according to a letter he wrote to The Morning Call in response to an interview request.
Pawlowski, who has a degree in urban planning and public policy from the University of Illinois, said his civics class includes an overview of the U.S. Constitution, the legislative process and the various branches of government. The curriculum is supplemented with movies and shows including "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington" and "Schoolhouse Rock."
When he's not teaching, Pawlowski takes a turn as a student, studying Hebrew, Arabic and Spanish.
"I thought Hebrew would be the hardest to learn, but Arabic is tough, especially since each letter has beginning, middle and ending form," Pawlowski wrote.
The former mayor said he spends his afternoons and weekends in the prison's law library, where he has become "quite the legal scholar." There, Pawlowski said he works on his appeal, which is being considered by the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. And he has also been helping inmates with immigration paperwork and presidential pardon requests.
"I'm thinking of just skipping law school and just taking the bar exam when I get out," he wrote, punctuating the sentence with "(smile)."
Pawlowski is due to be released in 2031.
Asked to corroborate the details of Pawlowski's letter, the executive assistant at FCI Danbury said the prison cannot release information on an individual inmate's education and activities.
"However, the Bureau of Prison provides a wide variety of educational, vocational, and recreation activities to the inmate population to participate in which provide opportunities for skill enhancement to prepare for reentry and encourages inmates to use their time constructively," prison officials said in a statement.
The ex-mayor said he also is using his time to get in shape and that he's dropped 30 pounds. He enrolled in yoga and spin classes, walks the track each morning and works out in the weight room three times a week.
"The one good thing about prison is that it has gotten me in shape," he said.
Also a graduate of Moody Bible Institute in Chicago, Pawlowski has drawn upon his religious background, acting as a head elder for the prison's church. He said he leads a Bible study once a week and collects donations from inmates of soup, toothpaste and toothbrushes for new inmates. He has also been drumming in a worship band as well as in a blues/rock group. Pawlowski said his drumming occupies about 10 hours each week.
Church elder isn't the only leadership role he's held. Pawlowski said he is also "administrative orderly" for his 80-inmate unit, overseeing a crew of 15 men who clean it, securing supplies and handling quality of life issues.
"It's kind of like being mayor but for a lot less money," Pawlowski wrote. "I get all the complaints, work the bureaucracy to get things done and attempt to motivate folks to keep our living environment habitable."
For those eager to hear more about Pawlowski's stint in prison, he said he has begun writing a book about the experience. FCI Danbury was also the inspiration for the memoir "Orange is the New Black," penned by Piper Kerman.
"I'm sure it will be on The New York Times best seller list soon (smile)," Pawlowski wrote.

Texto completo: "The Vagina Monologues," a play about female sexuality, body image and other topics from the viewpoint of a variety of women, is coming to ArtsQuest Center in Bethlehem.
The episodic play, which features women frankly talking about their relationship to their anatomy, including childbirth, pelvic exams, rape and orgasms, will be performed at 6 p.m. Feb. 16, Valentine's Day weekend, in the Blast Furnace Room.
Tickets, at $22.50 for Arts-Quest members, $23 for students and seniors and $25 for others, are on sale at the ArtsQuest Center box office, at www.steelstacks.org and at 610-332-3378.
All proceeds from the play will be donated to Women's Resources of Monroe County and Crime Victims Council of the Lehigh Valley.
The humorous play, which started as an off-off-Broadway production in 1996, won author Eve Ensler the Off-Broadway Obie Award for Best New Play that year and has been called by The New York Times "probably the most important piece of political theater of the last decade,"
At ArtsQuest Center, the play will be produced by Samuel Saint Thomas, a Bethlehem professor and musician, and directed by Casey McGinty, a Lehigh Valley actress and musician.
"There has never been a more important and crucial time than now to bring men into the conversation of women's empowerment and freedom," Saint Thomas said.
"The Vagina Monologues," first performed in a cafe basement in New York's Greenwich Village, has been translated into 48 languages and performed in more than 140 countries.

Texto completo: I've covered things that injure, sicken and kill kids and adults for more than 30 years. From auto safety to medical errors, I've competed to break stories on the latest deadly defect or health policy change, most recently on electronic cigarettes.
In late August, I added vaping-related lung illnesses to the beat. Last month, I added marijuana, psychosis and other mental illnesses.
A search on the news archive Nexis shows that the number of stories mentioning "vaping" and "lung illness" went from 953 in September to 584 in October, a nearly 40% drop.
The deaths and injuries from lung illnesses are declining, but they've hardly abated and are clearly a sign of a much larger problem with excessive marijuana use among young people. Yet families from the D'Ambrosios in California to the Donats in Connecticut were caught unaware.
Ricky D'Ambrosio, 21, was in a medically induced coma for four of the 10 days he was hospitalized in August after vaping THC from a dispensary. He had a medical marijuana card.
D'Ambrosio's recovering well now, but my Connecticut high school friend Billy Donat's family wasn't so lucky.
Recently, Donat emailed me for the first time: "Sometimes we reach out to old friends at the worst of times, this is one of those times. On Christmas Day, my son of 22 years put an electric cord around his neck and hung himself one day after his release from Yale Psychiatric Hospital. On the table in the living room was a copy (of) USA Today dated 12/16/2019. I told my son that you had written an article about his condition linking pot to psychosis. SCHIZOPHRENIA. I had read the front page at the news stand. I wish I had turned to page 6 and finished the article."
If he had, he would have seen that the federal "mental health czar" and psychiatrist, Elinore McCance-Katz, lamenting about how little attention the "settled science" on pot and psychosis gets and the huge increase in suicides among young people with marijuana in their systems in Colorado.
On Tuesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said 2,561 people have been hospitalized with vaping-related lung illness and 55 have died. That's one more death and over 50 more hospitalizations from two weeks earlier. CDC said 80% of hospitalized patients who had complete information about their products reported vaping THC; 13% said they vaped just nicotine.
Former New York Times business reporter Alex Berenson says that the human cost of cannabis is too high – and that the media is too pro-pot. When his latest book, "Tell Your Children: The Truth about Marijuana, Mental Illness and Violence," came out last year, he knew marijuana proponents wouldn't like it. He just didn't think there would be what he calls a "media brownout": No publications reviewed it. (USA TODAY interviewed him for a March article.)
The recent story I wrote with colleagues on marijuana's link to mental health ran on the front page and was one of the top stories on our website for days. More than 250 people with children or personal experience with mental illness linked to marijuana joined our Facebook support group – I Survived It.
I don't know about you, but that makes me pay attention.

Film's legend links Eisenhower, extraterrestrials

Autor: Archer, Greg.

Texto completo: Written and directed by Christopher Munch, "The 11th Green" begins on slow simmer and eventually arrives at an emotional boil as it floats back and forth through time to explore a curious proposition: that former President Dwight D. Eisenhower was not only interested in but also had contact with extraterrestrials.
The film, which was partially shot in Palm Desert and other Coachella Valley locations, screens in the Locals Spotlight program at the 31st annual Palm Springs International Film Festival.
"There was an urban legend out there for some time, and I believe reports first appeared in the 1950s that Dwight Eisenhower had one or more face-to-face interactions with visitors from other worlds," Munch says. "What interested me about the story was not so much the specifics of it or whether it was true or not, but more so the emotional 'what if?' involving Eisenhower. How this man would have potentially reflected back on those experiences late in his life. Would he have regrets or done things differently?"
How did Munch craft a story with a potentially contentious subject matter that today's audiences could embrace? With an inventive storyline.
The plot: After his 85-year-old father dies from a sudden heart attack, slick Washington D.C. journalist Jeremy Rudd (played by Campbell Scott) returns to his golf resort home. Fighting memories of his beleaguered father-and-son relationship, Jeremy suddenly becomes much more acquainted with his father's mysterious legacy.
Toss in a romantic interest via his father's former assistant, Laurie (played by Agnes Bruckner), and a visit from his father's protégé, Jacobsen (played by Currie Graham), who hands Jeremy reels of film that suggest America had interaction with off-world visitors 50 years ago, and our protagonist suddenly finds himself in a personal and professional conundrum.
Is his newfound potential love interest clouding his interest? Should he believe in the film footage presented to him?
Running parallel to the present-day storyline, the story reveals Jeremy's father served on the National Security Council staff of the former president (played by George Gerdes) and that the country's collective fear pretty much left the "extraterrestrial question" in the wrong hands. Then, in 1967, two years before his death, the president finds himself revisiting the ghosts of his past in the same house that Jeremy would later inherit from his father, who, in this creative iteration, happened to own it after Ike.
"Originally the storyline was to focus just on Eisenhower in his home in Palm Desert," Munch says. "But ultimately it would take place in several different time periods. I adopted the framing device of a contemporary journalist whose father was a young man in Eisenhower's council and very trusted and I took the liberty of having him purchase the house Eisenhower once lived in, which, of course, didn't happen in real life, but it seemed like a way that the protagonist could get immersed into what happened."
Munch, a Los Angeles resident who frequents the valley, filmed the project on a low budget and with minimal crew. He says he found the Greater Palm Springs Film Alliance & Film Office to be very helpful, noting, "it's exactly the opposite of when you're filming a major production in places like Los Angeles where there's a lot of red tape."
Local landmarks such as Shields Date Garden in Indio, which Munch had visited many times, are also featured in the film.
"I wrote a scene that would take place there in the Shields' theater, where our intelligence operative shows our protagonist the alleged footage from Eisenhower's meeting with the extraterrestrial," he says. "It was nice way to photograph these historic local places."
As for the subject matter of the film, there could be a bit of kismet involved.
A 2017 Washington Post article noted that The Pentagon officially confirmed there was a $22 million government program "to collect and analyze 'anomalous aerospace threats' — government-speak for UFOs." In 2019, the New York Times featured interviews with several Navy pilots who said they witnessed, and in several instances recorded, unexplained flying objects off of the East Coast.
"In the course of the last year, the film has become timelier," Munch says. "Major publications have documented, in a very dry and matter-of-fact way, incidents involving the U.S. Military engaging with UFOs over the past 15 years or so. This has all been presented in a way which cannot be easily dismissed, as it was from the 1950s onward, where UFOs and ETs were only considered in the context of the 'giggle factor.' The subject is timelier even though these current articles have no direct relation to those Eisenhower years."
And what of Eisenhower's alleged encounters with a higher intelligence?
"I find that it would have been very routine for him; I don't think anything really phased Eisenhower," Munch muses.
"As far as my protagonist in the film, I certainly arrived at the scenes with his incredulity. He's a journalist who's reported on mainstream and fringe science. He certainly has a predisposition, but it's balanced out by his concern for the validity of what he's reporting. I think that's the quandary for any journalist who is having to report on the subject of UFOs or extraterrestrials."

Texto completo: Polk County became one Esposito's biggest clients, paying $5,000 a month for representation in Washington.
It's unclear what, if any, role Polk County will play in an investigation of a former Washington lobbyist whose home the FBI raided last week.
Polk County Administrator Mark Wandro said this week that county officials have not been contacted by the FBI. And spokespeople for Iowa's congressional delegation said they have heard little about the FBI probe involving Michael Esposito.
Esposito has not returned Des Moines Register phone calls seeking comment, and so far, the FBI has not revealed what it seized in the raid, which the Washington Post reported was seeking evidence of fraud.
The county's link to Esposito and his Federal Advocates lobbying firm goes back more than a decade. It became one his biggest clients, paying $5,000 a month for his representation in Washington.
The relationship took a big leap in 2016. The county signed a new contract with Federal Advocates for $60,000 a month — $720,000 a year — to try to protect the nonprofit status of its Prairie Meadows casino using Esposito's ties in Washington.
Yet the contract, which committed the county to paying more than the nation's largest counties for lobbying services, received little attention until Watchdog reported about it this summer.
"That struck a nerve with me," said state Sen. Claire Celsi, a Des Moines Democrat who blasted the payments on Facebook. "I just knew by looking at those numbers that Polk County had no business trying to justify that amount of spending."
Esposito, meanwhile, was busy signing up other lucrative clients, claiming close ties to President Donald Trump, administration officials and the Republican National Committee. The firm took in $4.76 million last year — before the RNC sent Esposito a cease-and-desist letter and Trump denied on Twitter that he knew the lobbyist.
Now, Esposito is drawing much wider attention following the raid on his suburban Washington home last week by the FBI
Interesting clients Some of Federal Advocates' newer clients are of particular interest to politicians, government watchdogs and reporters.
Esposito registered last year to represent the political party Justice in Ukraine, which is led by Valentyn Nalyvaichenko, a member of parliament and former head of the Ukrainian security services. According to a November article in the Post, Nalyvaichenko called for investigations into Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son, Hunter. Trump's alleged insistence on such an investigation is at the center of the impeachment case against him.
Another client, Huawei Technologies, paid Federal Advocates $1.65 million for three months' work, according to lobbyist filings collected by the Center for Responsive Politics.
The Chinese tech giant has been accused by governments around the world of working with Chinese national spy agencies. The Trump administration had blacklisted the company and its affiliates for doing business with U.S. companies without seeking approval from the U.S. government, and the president told a number of media outlets the U.S. would not be doing business with Huawei because the company was a national security concern.
But in October, the president agreed to issue licenses allowing some American companies to serve as suppliers to Huawei after the ban proved a thorn in U.S.-China trade talks, according to articles in the Wall Street Journal and New York Times.
Public records show that after Trump was elected, Esposito took a sharply different tack with the firm he founded in 2006.
In 2015, Esposito was a lobbyist for Democrats, and tried to use his relationship with the Polk supervisors to drum up business with Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign, emails published by WikiLeaks show.
He wrote Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta, saying he was "extremely close with the supervisors, and the other electeds, who I believe could significantly help early in Iowa."
By last year, Esposito was engaging in riskier practices, like when he hired Hassan Nasser Fawaz, a Lebanese banker with ties to institutions that had been sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury.
According to an investigative report in the Daily Beast, Fawaz's role as senior director of international affairs was to introduce the firm's lobbyists to potential clients who had been sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury Department. His hiring occurred even though it is illegal for American companies to lobby for sanctioned individuals.
The institutions Fawaz worked for had links to Hezbollah and a notorious drug trafficker, according to the report.
After registering as a foreign agent last year, Esposito also hired Alexander Savostianov, a former diplomat who, as deputy consul general of Ukraine in San Francisco, promoted "Ukrainian foreign policy objectives," according to his company biography.
According to the November Post article, Esposito requested meetings last year for a Justice Party official with Vice President Mike Pence, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and then-National Security Adviser John Bolton to discuss the conflict between Ukraine and Russia.
But the meeting requests were denied, he reported.
Generous donor In 2019, Esposito gave at least $30,000 to the Trump Victory political action committee and another $39,100 to the Republican National Committee, according to the Federal Election Commission.
Polk supervisor Matt McCoy said Esposito boasted during a May 2019 conference in Washington that he was very close with Jared Kushner, that he was heading the RNC's re-election efforts for Trump, and that he personally vetted candidates for the Trump cabinet.
"He implied that the guy following us that day was security and was assigned by the Trump team," McCoy said.
In 2018, Esposito made one of the largest campaign donations to Angela Connolly, who headed the county board the year after the supervisors signed their more expensive lobbying contract.
Only millionaire West Des Moines developer Bill Knapp and Kurt Rasmussen, board chairman of Prairie Meadows Racetrack and Casino, gave as much to Connolly's re-election committee that year, according to the Iowa Ethics and Campaign Disclosure Board.
Until Federal Advocates' contract expired in December, Connolly and other supervisors defended the firm and continued to make the monthly $60,000 contract payments after the first Watchdog probe in July.
After Watchdog reports about Federal Advocates, McCoy, who this month became the board's new chairman, voted against further payments. But other supervisors voted in favor of paying the firm's bills until its contract expired in December.

Texto completo: "Mike Leach is a proven winner who has established a culture of excellence for nearly two decades as a head coach, ... he has a track record of building programs to national prominence with accountability and a blue-collar approach. We are thrilled to welcome him and his family to the Mississippi State family."
John Cohen, MSU athletic director
STARKVILLE – The pirate ship has found a new dock.
Washington State head coach Mike Leach, often referred to as "the pirate" because of his fascination with 18th-century pirates, is steering his ship Southeast to become the head coach at Mississippi State.
"I can't tell you how excited I am to be the head football coach of the Mississippi State Bulldogs," Leach said in a statement. "I loved Washington State, but I am excited for the next chapter in the SEC."
Leach has been the head coach at Washington State since 2012. He has compiled a 55-47 record in Pullman. Most recently, the Cougars went 6-7 in 2019 after an 11-2 season in 2018, which marked the most wins in program history.
Leach, 58, replaces Joe Moorhead, who was fired last week after two seasons in Starkville. Moorhead went 14-12 at Mississippi State.
Leach has an overall record of 139-90 in head coaching stops at Texas Tech and Washington State. Leach brought both programs to unprecedented heights. He also led Tech to its only 11-win season in program history in 2008.
"Mike Leach is a proven winner who has established a culture of excellence for nearly two decades as a head coach," MSU athletic director John Cohen said in a statement. "An offensive genius and two-time national coach of the year, he has a track record of building programs to national prominence with accountability and a blue-collar approach. We are thrilled to welcome him and his family to the Mississippi State family and look forward to watching our football program grow under his leadership."
Well known for his air-raid offensive system, Leach has coached some of the best offenses in college football over the last two decades. His quarterback this past season, Anthony Gordon, led the country in passing yards per game.
Gordon threw for 429.2 yards per game. The second man on that list was Heisman Trophy winner Joe Burrow, who passed for 372 yards per game. Gordon also tossed 48 touchdown passes this season, second behind only Burrow's 55.
Washington State had the nation's No. 7 total offense in 2019 despite its losing record. The Cougars racked up 505.2 yards per game.
Time will tell if Leach's pass-heavy offense works in the SEC.
Broyles Award winner Joe Brady, LSU's passing game coordinator who has been credited with revitalizing the Tigers' offensive attack, proved that it probably can, but only if teams have the right pieces.
The ins and outs of whether Leach will work at Mississippi State, though, can and will be discussed once the pirate settles into his new quarters. For now, the Bulldogs are getting a facelift that comes with national exposure.
Leach is known for his comedic antics in press conferences, such as discussing which Pac 12 mascot would win in a melee. He's one of the most recognizable faces and voices in college football.
And that's for better or worse.
Leach was controversially fired from Texas Tech for legal cause in 2009 for an incident involving a player who sustained a concussion on Dec. 16 of that year. The player was Adam James, son of former SMU standout running back Craig James.
According to USA Today Sports, the elder James told then-Texas Tech chancellor Kent Hance in an e-mail that his son was punished by Leach for sustaining the injury and that he was locked in a closet for hours while the rest of the team carried on with daily routines in preparation for the Alamo Bowl, which was to be played two weeks later.
Leach adamantly denied the allegations, but he was suspended by the university on Dec. 28. He was fired on Dec. 30.
Leach's first public comments after his termination came in an interview with the New York Times that was released on Jan. 1, 2010. In the interview, Leach denied that he had mistreated James. He said he ordered James to be taken "out of the light."
"He was never locked anywhere," Leach said. "At no point was he locked anywhere."
Leach also said the James family fabricated the allegations because they were upset about Adam James' lack of playing time. Making matters even messier, Leach said the motive to fire him one year after the best season in program history was monetary.
Leach would have received a $800,000 retention bonus, he told USA Today Sports, if he was still the head coach at Texas Tech on Dec. 31, 2009. He also said he was never given roughly $1.6 million in "guaranteed" income for that season.
Ten years and multiple failed law suits later, Leach does not have the money. But he does have a reputable name in college football again because of his success at Washington State, and he also has a head coaching gig in the SEC as of today.
The pirate ship is still afloat and sailing forward.
"Mike Leach is a proven winner who has established a culture of excellence for nearly two decades as a head coach, ... he has a track record of building programs to national prominence with accountability and a blue-collar approach. We are thrilled to welcome him and his family to the Mississippi State family."

5 things to know about coach Leach

Texto completo: The Mississippi State football program has announced the hire of Mike Leach, former head coach at Washington State and Texas Tech.
Leach has 18 years of experience as a Power 5 head coach and has led his teams to 16 bowl games. Leach's teams have finished seasons ranked in the top 25 six times, including in 2018 when Washington State went 11-2 and ranked No. 10 in both the AP Top 25 and the Amway Coaches Poll at the end of the season.
Leach is known for being a pioneer of the Air Raid offense and has thrived with quarterbacks putting up eye-popping numbers. He's also known for having a larger-than-life personality in interviews and on Twitter.
Here are five things to know about Mississippi State's new head coach.
1. Mike Leach has a successful track record Leach has a career record of 139-90 in his 18 seasons as a head coach and has led his teams to bowl berths in all but two of those seasons. In 2008, Leach led Texas Tech to an 11-2 record and a Cotton Bowl appearance behind the talents of quarterback Graham Harrell and wide receiver Michael Crabtree.
In 2018, Leach's Washington State Cougars went 11-2 thanks to a record-setting passing season from Mississippi native Gardner Minshew.
Leach has overseen 12 eight-win seasons in his career and has done so in secluded towns like Lubbock, Texas, and Pullman, Washington, that have a reputation for being hard to recruit.
2. Mike Leach loves to throw Leach is a descendant of football legend Hal Mumme's Air Raid passing tree. Leach coached with Mumme at Iowa Wesleyan, Valdosta State and Kentucky, where the pair revolutionized the modern passing offense and thrived with quarterbacks like former No. 1 NFL Draft pick Tim Couch.
Leach continued his pass-first offensive attack for one season as the offensive coordinator at Oklahoma before parlaying those schemes into his head coaching career. Leach's offenses have led the FBS in passing yards per game 10 times in his head coaching career, including each of the last two seasons.
In 2019 alone, Washington State attempted 54.6 pass plays per game. No team finished within 10 pass attempts per game of that mark, with Texas Tech ranking second in the FBS at 44.3 pass plays per game.
3. Mike Leach has a large coaching tree In addition to Leach's success on the field, the coach has done an impressive job of training a generation of offensive minds. Some prominent coaches who have worked under Leach include: SMU coach Sonny Dykes, Houston coach Dana Holgorsen, Oklahoma coach Lincoln Riley, North Texas coach Seth Littrell and former Baylor coach Art Briles.
Leach also coached a large number of players who have become prominent coaches. That list includes: Arizona Cardinals coach Kliff Kingsbury, West Virginia coach Neal Brown, UCF coach Josh Heupel and Harrell, who now works as USC's offensive coordinator.
4. Mike Leach had a contentious exit from Texas Tech On Dec. 28, 2009 season, Texas Tech suspended Leach while investigating alleged inappropriate treatment of one of his players. Leach allegedly ordered the player in question, Adam James, to stand in an equipment closet during a practice he missed with a concussion.
According to reports at the time of the event, Texas Tech gave Leach until Dec. 28 to apologize to James in writing for the incident. Leach refused to do so.
Leach was fired two days after his suspension began. In a statement released after his dismissal, Leach accused Texas Tech of lying about the situation and said he thinks the lies stemmed from leftover animosity related to contract negotiations from the prior year.
In an interview with the New York Times the day after he was fired, Leach denied the allegations against him, saying he only ordered James be "taken out of the light" due to his condition. Leach also alleged the situation was a result of James' father, former SMU running back and ESPN analyst Craig James, being dissatisfied with his son's lack of playing time.
Leach sued Texas Tech for wrongful termination without cause and for issuing defamatory statements. In 2011, the Texas 7th Court of Appeals ruled in favor of Texas Tech but said Leach was within his right to claim "non-monetary reparations."
In 2012, the Texas Supreme Court denied Leach's petition for review. Leach's defamation lawsuits against ESPN and Craig James were eventually dismissed as well.

According to a New York Times profile of Leach back in 2005, Leach likes to use offseasons to learn everything he can about a specific non-sports topic that interests him, ranging from Geronimo and Jackson Pollock to whales and grizzly bears.

Texto completo: It's time to sit back in a cozy easy chair, perhaps a couch stacked with cushions, and maybe even beside a fire, pick up a good book and read.
Numerous books - fiction and nonfiction - arrived in 2019 and many are still available in local bookstores and on the internet. There are also a few old favorites from years past still waiting to be enjoyed.
Richmond native and national best-selling author David Baldacci published three new novels in 2019: "A Minute to Midnight: An Atlee Pine Thriller," "One Good Deed," featuring a new character Aloysius Archer, and "Redemption, A Memory Man Thriller." Another Virginia-based author, Rita Mae Brown, has a new book, "Scarlet Fever," a "Sister" Jane Arnold mystery and earlier in the year another novel, "Whiskers in the Dark: A Mrs. Murphy Mystery," co-authored by Sneaky Pie Brown, her cat.
In the murder mystery vein, most of us are familiar with Agatha Christie's "Hercule Poirot" detective novels; another writer in the same genre was Dorothy Sayers. She and her sleuth Lord Peter Wimsey make for a wonderful read on a chilly winter night. These books were popular way back when, but still can be found on the internet and in used book stores. In fact, "Lord Peter: A full collection of all Lord Peter Wimsey Stories," is still available in hardcover and paperback.
On the local front, an important book illustrating the story of the early African American involvement at the College of William & Mary was written by Jacquelyn McLendon, professor of English, emerita was published. "Building on the Legacy: African Americans at William and Mary" includes those first African American students and the growth of the black experience on campus. It also offers a new perspective on the enslaved people who helped build and maintain the institution, an often-overlooked element of the college's story.
Pulitzer Prize winning author Alan Taylor has written a double-faceted book, "Thomas Jefferson's Education," that explores his early education at William & Mary, his educational philosophy and his efforts to establish the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, within sight of his home at Monticello.
2019 was the 75th anniversary of the D-Day invasion, and two significant books related to the events were published: "Every Man a Hero: A Memoir of D-Day, the First Wave at Omaha Beach and a World at War," by Ray Lambert, who is 99 and living in North Carolina, and "The First Wave: The D-Day Warriors Who Led the Way to Victory in World War II," by Alex Kershaw, author of "The Bedford Boys."
Individuals within the scope of American presidential history were the subjects of two important 2019 books: "The Matriarch: Barbara Bush and the Making of an American Dynasty," by Susan Page, USA Today's Washington Bureau Chief and "America's Reluctant Prince: The Life of John F. Kennedy Jr." by Steven M. Gillon, New York Times bestselling author.

Texto completo: The Mississippi State football program has announced the hire of Mike Leach, former head coach at Washington State and Texas Tech.
Leach has 18 years of experience as a Power 5 head coach and has led his teams to 16 bowl games. Leach's teams have finished seasons ranked in the top 25 six times, including in 2018 when Washington State went 11-2 and ranked No. 10 in both the AP Top 25 and the Amway Coaches Poll at the end of the season.
Leach is known for being a pioneer of the Air Raid offense and has thrived with quarterbacks putting up eye-popping numbers. He's also known for having a larger-than-life personality in interviews and on Twitter.
Here are five things to know about Mississippi State's new head coach.
1. Mike Leach has a successful track record Leach has a career record of 139-90 in his 18 seasons as a head coach and has led his teams to bowl berths in all but two of those seasons. In 2008, Leach led Texas Tech to an 11-2 record and a Cotton Bowl appearance behind the talents of quarterback Graham Harrell and wide receiver Michael Crabtree.
In 2018, Leach's Washington State Cougars went 11-2 thanks to a record-setting passing season from Mississippi native Gardner Minshew.
Leach has overseen 12 eight-win seasons in his career and has done so in secluded towns like Lubbock, Texas, and Pullman, Washington, that have a reputation for being hard to recruit.
2. Mike Leach loves to throw Leach is a descendant of football legend Hal Mumme's Air Raid passing tree. Leach coached with Mumme at Iowa Wesleyan, Valdosta State and Kentucky, where the pair revolutionized the modern passing offense and thrived with quarterbacks like former No. 1 NFL Draft pick Tim Couch.
Leach continued his pass-first offensive attack for one season as the offensive coordinator at Oklahoma before parlaying those schemes into his head coaching career. Leach's offenses have led the FBS in passing yards per game 10 times in his head coaching career, including each of the last two seasons.
In 2019 alone, Washington State attempted 54.6 pass plays per game. No team finished within 10 pass attempts per game of that mark, with Texas Tech ranking second in the FBS at 44.3 pass plays per game.
3. Mike Leach has a large coaching tree In addition to Leach's success on the field, the coach has done an impressive job of training a generation of offensive minds. Some prominent coaches who have worked under Leach include: SMU coach Sonny Dykes, Houston coach Dana Holgorsen, Oklahoma coach Lincoln Riley, North Texas coach Seth Littrell and former Baylor coach Art Briles.
Leach also coached a large number of players who have become prominent coaches. That list includes: Arizona Cardinals coach Kliff Kingsbury, West Virginia coach Neal Brown, UCF coach Josh Heupel and Harrell, who now works as USC's offensive coordinator.
4. Mike Leach had a contentious exit from Texas Tech On Dec. 28, 2009 season, Texas Tech suspended Leach while investigating alleged inappropriate treatment of one of his players. Leach allegedly ordered the player in question, Adam James, to stand in an equipment closet during a practice he missed with a concussion.
According to reports at the time of the event, Texas Tech gave Leach until Dec. 28 to apologize to James in writing for the incident. Leach refused to do so.
Leach was fired two days after his suspension began. In a statement released after his dismissal, Leach accused Texas Tech of lying about the situation and said he thinks the lies stemmed from leftover animosity related to contract negotiations from the prior year.
In an interview with the New York Times the day after he was fired, Leach denied the allegations against him, saying he only ordered James be "taken out of the light" due to his condition. Leach also alleged the situation was a result of James' father, former SMU running back and ESPN analyst Craig James, being dissatisfied with his son's lack of playing time.
Leach sued Texas Tech for wrongful termination without cause and for issuing defamatory statements. In 2011, the Texas 7th Court of Appeals ruled in favor of Texas Tech but said Leach was within his right to claim "non-monetary reparations."
In 2012, the Texas Supreme Court denied Leach's petition for review. Leach's defamation lawsuits against ESPN and Craig James were eventually dismissed as well.
5. Mike Leach's personality is large Leach is known for being an eccentric person. He's gained the nickname "the pirate" because of his long-standing fascination with swashbucklers.

Facebook Allows Campaigns To Target Voters

Texto completo: In a break with other tech companies, Facebook Inc. said it wouldn't limit how political advertising targets potential voters, but would instead give users tools to see fewer of those ads on its platforms.
Facebook's stance -- that companies shouldn't decide how campaigns are able to reach voters -- is at odds with other tech firms' approach to handling political advertising ahead of the 2020 election.
Operators of online platforms are under increasing pressure to curb the spread of misleading or false information in the wake of the 2016 presidential campaign, which U.S. intelligence agencies have said was subject to foreign meddling online.
Facebook's announcement Thursday highlighted the divide in opinion on what the company's role should be in elections, as critics -- including some Democratic presidential candidates -- said the latest decision leaves the door wide open for disinformation.
Facebook has acknowledged that the spread of disinformation, including through targeted ads, is a problem and has expressed a desire for federal regulation of political advertising online. But its announcement in September that it would exempt politicians' and certain other ads from its third-party fact-checking program fed skepticism about its commitment to combating disinformation on its platform.
The company based its latest decision "on the principle that people should be able to hear from those who wish to lead them, warts and all, and that what they say should be scrutinized and debated in public," according to a blog post from Rob Leathern, Facebook's director of product management. "This does not mean that politicians can say whatever they like in advertisements on Facebook."
The post said all Facebook users have to follow its community standards, which ban hate speech, harmful content and content designed to intimidate voters or stop them from exercising their right to vote.
The company's announcement Thursday also included changes that Facebook said will boost transparency in its ad library relating to how political advertisers deploy their messages on its platforms.
Facebook's approach, including giving users more control over what they see, contrasts with moves by Twitter Inc. and Alphabet Inc.'s Google.
Google earlier this week launched its new policy globally barring advertisers from targeting political messages based on users' interests inferred from their browsing or search histories, among other changes. Twitter stopped accepting most political ads in November.
Facebook acknowledged it considered restricting targeting but chose not to do so.
The Wall Street Journal previously reported Facebook was weighing, among other steps, raising the minimum number of people who can be targeted in political ads on its platform from 100 to a few thousand. The practice known as microtargeting has been criticized for enabling political actors to single out groups for misleading or false ads that aren't exposed to broader public scrutiny.
Facebook said its data showed more than 85% of ad spending by U.S. presidential candidates is for messages aimed at an audience of more than 250,000 people.
The social-media giant said it consulted with a number of nonprofits, political groups and election campaigns -- both Democratic and Republican -- before reaching its decision.
"Ultimately, we don't think decisions about political ads should be made by private companies, which is why we are arguing for regulation that would apply across the industry," Mr. Leathern said, echoing comments Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg has made about the need for federal regulation of political advertising.
Reaction to Facebook's latest decision again showed divergent opinions on how the company should treat political ads.
Trump campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh said Facebook's decision not to limit targeting allows more Americans to be involved in politics. In any case, he said, there is no escaping political messaging.
"If users do elect to see fewer political ads it still won't stop them from being bombarded by ads from the news media, which are biased and just as political, because there's a loophole in the rule for the media," Mr. Murtaugh said.
Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D., Minn.) criticized Facebook's decision. "Facebook is doubling down on a policy that hurts our democracy," the presidential candidate said in a statement that reiterated her call for comprehensive federal rules on digital political ads.
The campaign of Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden also was critical of the company. "Today's announcement is more window dressing around their decision to allow paid misinformation," said campaign spokesman Bill Russo.
Roughly $3 billion is expected to be spent on political advertising online for the 2020 U.S. election. But with Election Day less than a year away, a lack of uniform rules has led to confusion about exactly what is allowed on digital platforms, how new policies will be enforced and whether advertising strategies and budgets will need to change further.
Facebook's announcement comes two days after the New York Times reported on an internal post by Facebook executive Andrew Bosworth, in which he said he believed the platform played a central role in the 2016 presidential election.
"So was Facebook responsible for Donald Trump getting elected? I think the answer is yes, but not for the reasons anyone thinks. He didn't get elected because of Russia or misinformation or Cambridge Analytica. He got elected because he ran the single best digital ad campaign I've ever seen from any advertiser. Period," Mr. Bosworth wrote.
Facebook said it aims to roll out its new user-control feature in the U.S. early this summer on its main platform and on Instagram.
Facebook said while its users have been able to hide all messages from a specific advertiser in their ad preferences, they soon will be able to stop seeing ads based on how an advertiser constructed its list of targeted users.

OFFICIALS: IRANIAN MISSILE BROUGHT DOWN JET EVIDENCE SUGGESTS TRAGEDY ACCIDENTAL

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - An Iranian missile accidentally brought down a Ukrainian jetliner over Iran this week, killing everyone aboard, American and allied officials said on Thursday, adding a tragic coda to the escalated military conflict between Washington and Tehran.
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada said his country had intelligence that an Iranian surface-to-air missile brought down the jetliner, which was carrying 63 Canadians among its some 176 passengers and crew. Mr. Trudeau said his conclusion was based on a preliminary review of the evidence but called for a full investigation "to be convinced beyond all doubt."
"We recognize that this may have been done accidentally," Mr. Trudeau said at a news conference in Ottawa. "The evidence suggests very clearly a possible and probable cause for the crash."
United States officials had a "high level of confidence" that the Iranians brought down the airliner by mistake, one American official said. The official said two missiles fired from an Iranian air defense system, the SA-15, shot down the airliner.
The Ukrainian airliner, a Boeing 737-800, went down on Wednesday morning. It had turned back toward the Tehran airport before it crashed in a huge explosion minutes after takeoff, according to an initial Iranian report released on Thursday. The report said the plane, bound for Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital, was in flames before it hit the ground but did not send a distress signal.
Although both the United States and Iran now appear to be backing away from a larger military confrontation, the new intelligence suggests that the loss of life from the downing of the plane was a direct result of those heightened tensions between the countries.
American satellites, designed to track missile launches, detected the firing of the Iranian short-range interceptor. U.S. intelligence agencies later intercepted Iranian communications confirming that the SA-15 system brought down the Ukrainian airliner, officials said.
A security camera captured the impact - first the predawn darkness, then a series of blinding bursts of light in the distance, followed by a storm of burning debris in the foreground.
The circumstances of the disaster raised suspicions that the airliner was brought down by a missile. The crash occurred just hours after Iran launched a barrage of ballistic missiles at U.S. targets in Iraq, with Tehran presumably bracing for possible American retaliation.
American officials have been reluctant to publicly assign blame for the downing of the aircraft, apparently to keep from inflaming tensions with Iran, at a time both governments were taking steps to de-escalate the military confrontation that came to a head when an American drone killed Maj. Gen. Qassem Soleimani, one of the most senior figures in Iran's government.
The SA-15 missile is designed to operate at medium to very low altitude and intercept both aircraft and guided weapons, according to military documents. It has a maximum range of 15.5 miles and can intercept aircraft and missiles at an altitude of up to 32,800 feet.
A mobile system, the SA-15 could have been brought out by the Iranian military to defend the airport if officials believed the U.S. military was intending to counterattack after the missile strike. If the Iranians thought that the United States was going to target their airport or other facilities with guided missiles, the SA-15 system could have been used to try to intercept them.
The SA-15 can track multiple targets, and seek to shoot down two at once, meaning it can fire multiple missiles nearly simultaneously, according to the military documents.
The comments from American officials came after the Iranians invited the National Transportation Safety Board of the United States to assist in the investigation despite previous reports that the Americans would not be involved, according to correspondence reviewed by The New York Times.
The board has reached out to the State Department to determine how to proceed, according to two people familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity because the correspondence was not public. Sanctions against Iran prevent Boeing from contacting the Iranians without an export license, the people said.
On Wednesday, a spokesman for Iran's armed forces, Abolfazl Shekarchi, was quoted by the Iranian news media as saying that the crash was not a result of any military action.
"This is ridiculous," Mr. Shekarchi was quoted as saying. "Most of the passengers on this flight were our valued young Iranian men and women. Whatever we do, we do it for the protection and defense of our country and our people."

Texto completo: Silvio Horta, 'Ugly Betty' creator
Silvio Horta, best known as a writer and producer of ABC's popular series "Ugly Betty," died Tuesday, his family announced. He was 45.
"It is with great sadness that we announce the passing of our dear brother and son, Silvio Horta," a statement from his mother Anna and sister Hilda Horta read. "Through his friendships, his love and his work in TV and films, Silvio touched the lives of millions."
"Silvio had an ongoing struggle with addiction and depression, but through it all, he always found a way to turn his struggle into laughter," the statement added. "He was a kind and beautiful man. He may be gone but his light will shine on."
Mr. Horta died by suicide, according to the Miami-Dade Medical Examiner.
"Ugly Betty" followed the adventures of Betty Suarez (portrayed by America Ferrera), a cheerful, fashion-challenged young Mexican American woman from Queens, N.Y., who lands a job as an assistant at a fashion magazine in Manhattan. The show was an adaptation of a wildly popular Colombian telenovela, "Yo Soy Betty, La Fea."
Ms. Ferrera paid tribute to Mr. Horta on Tuesday. "I'm stunned and heartbroken to hear the devastating news of Ugly Betty creator, Silvio Horta's death," she wrote in a caption of a photo showing her with Mr. Horta and "Ugly Betty" producer Salma Hayek after a win at the Golden Globes. "His talent and creativity brought me and so many others such joy&light."
In a 2013 interview with the Television Academy Foundation, Mr. Horta said he believed his show's legacy would be "bringing a unique, diverse face to television" as well as highlighting social issues.
Mr. Horta, a first-generation Cuban American, was born Aug. 14, 1974, in Miami. He broke out in 1998 with his screenplay for slasher film "Urban Legend," which starred Jared Leto and Alicia Witt. In the early 2000s, Mr. Horta was also known for writing sci-fi series "The Chronicle" and for creating another series, "Jake 2.0," which starred Christopher Gorham.
Mr. Horta's most recent producing and writing credit was a 2015 movie on NBC, "The Curse of the Fuentes Women."
The toll-free National Suicide Prevention Lifeline number is 1-800-273-TALK (8255).
The New York Times and Syracuse Media Group contributed.

Texto completo: Can commoners ditch their duties, too — from the laundry, grocery shopping, work deadlines, making nice with the extended family?
Asking for a friend.
To recap the #Megxit drama: Harry, Meghan, and baby Archie went on the lam after announcing Wednesday that they were going to “step back" from royal duties. Meghan's grandmother-in-law (a.k.a. Queen “The Crown" Elizabeth) turned publicly passive-aggressive, and Buckingham Palace issued a statement about "complicated issues that will take time to work through."
The couple's “take-this-job-and-shove-it" moment, delivered on Instagram, tops the fed-up flight attendant of 2010 who cursed passengers over the PA system, then exited by way of the escape chute, becoming a folk hero along the way.
That guy was later arrested. And who knows? With the queen reportedly seeking a quick resolution to the scandal — maybe by now Buckingham Palace guards have rounded up the rogue royals, and Harry is in the back of a horse-drawn carriage muttering, “Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in."
But back in the real world, where access to money, celebrities, and air travel with no checked-bag fees are what people fantasize about escaping to , the royals' move has nonetheless captivated the public.
“That was the first thing I thought of — I would like to step back from my duties," said Alison Dagnes, a political science professor, the author of books on scandal, and perhaps most pertinent, the mother of two.
“They don't tell you this when you're a kid, but there's a lot to do," she said. “My students are so excited to go off into the 'real world' and I'm like, 'Don't do it!' "
In Boston, a middle-aged woman who comes from a large, contentious clan fantasized about stepping away from her familial duties and alerting her dear ones via social media, not in person.
“The beauty of it was that Meghan and Harry didn't even need to talk to the relatives," said the woman, who didn't want to be named for fear of family wrath. “They didn't have to see their tears, the anger, the threats."
Americans who have become certified royal experts by watching “The Crown" know that being a royal can be extremely boring. Dressing, dealing with protocol, giving and receiving little bows. Like you'd almost rather be in a human resources meeting about a proposed change in mileage reimbursement.
Those who have obsessively followed Meghan — who know, say, that Misha Nonoo the clothing designer, is a BFF — understand that things have not been easy for her. That what at first looked like a great role in fact carried stress beyond the pressure to appear delighted 24/7 and sit so your legs cross primly at the ankles.
As The New York Times reported, “She was too bold, too outspoken, too difficult, too American, too multicultural, the critics said. She should not have alienated the news media by refusing to join in their celebrity games. She should not have spent so much money renovating the house the royal family was kind enough to bestow upon her and her husband."
Within minutes of the young royals' announcement, media coverage reached a saturation point that even President Trump might envy, but even so, questions remain unanswered:
Are Meghan and Harry still on the Amazon Prime account? Will the queen turn their home, Frogmore Cottage, into a gym? How will Kate and Will explain this to George, Charlotte, and Louis (when he's older)?
(Suggested consumer story for British papers: “How to talk to the heirs about their uncle and aunt stepping back from their duties.")
How long have M & H been plotting this? They haven't even been married for that long. But the Daily Mail is reporting that the couple trademarked over 100 items, from hoodies to socks “SIX MONTHS before they split with the monarchy."
In many ways, this royal diss is so far removed from commoners' lives it's hard to relate to.
Most people who leave the family business don't have their wax likenesses removed from London's Madame Tussauds museum, for example.
But wax or not, they are subject to the same laws of human emotion as the rest of us, said Sherry Kuehl, author of the “Snarky in the Suburbs" books.
“Take 'royal' out of it and they're just a family," she said. “There are going to be chasms in that relationship that will never be healed. I think they're going to be lonely."
Perhaps, but at least they'll have gotten out of all those duties.

Texto completo: A thriller series based on a Jeffery Deaver novel debuts on NBC. And RuPaul stars in a new Netflix comedy series.
What's on TV
LINCOLN RHYME: HUNT FOR THE BONE COLLECTOR 8 p.m. on NBC. Human bones are strewn about New York in "The Bone Collector," Jeffery Deaver's 1997 novel about Lincoln Rhyme, a forensics expert who solves cases without leaving his apartment. He works with a younger detective who does the ground work in tracing a serial killer. The book was adapted into a 1999 feature with Denzel Washington and Angelina Jolie, who had only the roughly two-hour running time of the film to crack the case. This new TV series adaptation should give its stars more wiggle room. It casts Russell Hornsby as Rhyme, who is left unable to walk after an injury on the job. So he works remotely, electronically communicating with a young officer (played by Arielle Kebbel), who pursues the case's mysteries with Rhyme in her ear.
BILL BURR PRESENTS: THE RINGERS 11 p.m. on Comedy Central. The comedians Rosebud Baker, Jordan Temple and Josh Adam Meyers will be the first to appear on this new stand-up show from Bill Burr. Episodes are a sampler of rising talent, with three comics each performing a short set, after briefinterviews with Burr. It's an opportunity, Burr explains, for the comics to net "a TV credit that'll get you a hotel room where your door opens up to the hallway, rather than a parking lot."
What's Streaming
AJ AND THE QUEEN Stream on Netflix. "I'm not your mother," RuPaul Charles says in this new comedy series, "I'm a drag queen on a cross-country tour." He's talking to AJ (Izzy Gaspersz), a neglected 10-year-old who covertly hitches a ride as Charles's character, Ruby Red, sets off on a road trip. Turns out they kind of need each other: Each is leaving behind a troubled past, and they help each other work through that as they travel the country by mobile home. Their first stop: Pittsburgh. It's a city, Ruby Red tells AJ, where everyone is so friendly, "it's like going back in time."
THE LITTLE STRANGER (2018) Stream on HBO platforms. Domhnall Gleeson plays a doctor to haunted British blue bloods in this horror movie, an adaptation of a Gothic novel by Sarah Waters. Directed by Lenny Abrahamson ("Room"), the film is set around a sprawling estate in Warwickshire, England, in the late 1940s. There's suspense in the air -- plenty of mysterious, spooky episodes can found here -- but there's also a heavy amount of social commentary: This is a stately home in decline, and the story is told through Gleeson's character, a commoner who wouldn't be permitted to get comfortable there even if it weren't possibly haunted. "The twisting and cracking of the British class system is always fascinating to observe, and 'The Little Stranger' traces the details of its chosen moment of social change with precision and subtlety," A.O. Scott wrote in his review for The New York Times, "and with its own layers of somewhat dubious nostalgia."

CONFLICT WITH IRAN; Iran probably downed jet by accident, officials say

Texto completo: The Ukrainian jet that crashed near Tehran this week, killing all 176 people on board, was probably shot down accidentally by Iranian surface-to-air missiles, U.S. and Canadian officials said Thursday.
U.S. intelligence analysts reached the conclusion after reviewing satellite images and other intelligence that indicated Iran's forces fired two Russian-made SA-15 antiaircraft missiles at the jet shortly after it took off from Tehran's airport, a U.S. official familiar with the finding said.
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had made public similar conclusions earlier in the day.

"We have intelligence from multiple sources, including our allies and our own intelligence," Trudeau said. "The news will undoubtedly come as a further shock to the families who are already grieving in the face of this unspeakable tragedy."
The crash came just a few hours after Iran launched a ballistic missile attack against Iraqi military bases housing American troops amid a confrontation with Washington over the U.S. drone strike that killed an Iranian Revolutionary Guard general last week.
Two U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive intelligence, said they had no certain knowledge of Iranian intent. But they said the airliner could have been mistaken for a threat.
The New York Times published a video Thursday that it said appears to show the plane being hit by a missile.
President Trump suggested that he believed Iran was responsible but wouldn't directly blame the Iranians. He dismissed Iran's initial claim that it was a mechanical issue.
"Somebody could have made a mistake on the other side," Trump said, noting the plane was flying in a "pretty rough neighborhood."
"Some people say it was mechanical," Trump added. "I personally don't think that's even a question."
Iran on Thursday rejected the claim that the plane was brought down by its missiles, calling the claim "a very well-calculated move" and "a lie" by the United States.
"It is regrettable that the U.S. government's psychological operations system and its informed or uninformed allies are adding salt to the pains of the bereaved families with these lies and victimize affected families to reach their goals in the psychological operations," Ali Rabiei, an Iranian government spokesman, said in a statement.
The statement also included an invitation to Boeing, as the airliner's manufacturer, and to France, where the engine was built, to participate in the investigation.
The airline's owner, a Ukrainian company, has already sent investigators.
It was not immediately clear how the U.S. and its allies would react to the downing of the airliner. At least 63 Canadians and 11 Ukrainians were among the dead.
Despite efforts by Washington and Tehran to step back from the brink of possible war, the region remained on edge after the killing of the Iranian general and Iran's retaliatory missile strikes. U.S. troops were on high alert.
The latest assessment came just a day after Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Army Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said they hadn't had a chance to review the intelligence on the incident.
Both spent much of the day at the White House and on Capitol Hill briefing the administration on the killing of Gen. Qassem Suleimani and the resulting attacks by Iran.
A preliminary Iranian investigative report released Thursday said that the airliner pilots never made a radio call for help and that the burning aircraft was trying to turn back for the airport when it went down.
The plane crashed just minutes after taking off from Imam Khomeini International Airport in Tehran, the main airport for travelers in Iran.
Iranian officials initially blamed a technical malfunction for the crash.
Both of the "black boxes" that contain data and cockpit communications from the plane had been recovered, though they sustained damage and some parts of their memory were lost.
Hours before the plane crash, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration had issued an emergency flight restriction barring U.S. carriers and pilots from flying over areas of Iraqi, Iranian and some Persian Gulf airspace, warning of the "potential for miscalculation or misidentification" for civilian aircraft due to heightened political and military tensions.
Ukraine has a grim history with missile attacks, including in July 2014 when one such strike downed a Malaysia Airlines flight over eastern Ukraine, killing all 298 people aboard.
The plane in this week's crash was carrying 167 passengers and nine crew members from several countries, including 82 Iranians, officials said.
Many passengers were believed to be international students attending universities in Canada; they were making their way back to Toronto by way of Kyiv, Ukraine, after visiting family during the winter break.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said he planned to call Iranian President Hassan Rouhani about the crash and the investigation.
The crash ranked among the worst losses of life for Canadians in an aviation disaster. The flag over Parliament in Ottawa was lowered to half-staff, and Prime Minister Trudeau vowed to get to the bottom of the disaster.

With original music by Tom Judson.

'DRACULA' at Classic Stage Company (previews start on Jan. 14; opens on Feb. 17). What's your type? O-positive? AB-negative? Kate Hamill's adaptation of Bram Stoker's novel investigates the themes of gender and sexuality that course through its heart and major arteries.

'MEDEA' at the BAM Harvey Theater (previews start on Jan. 12; opens on Jan. 30). The visionary writer and director Simon Stone ("The Daughter," "Yerma") brings a modern version of an ancient tragedy to BAM. In this study of sexual jealousy and vengeance, Rose Byrne and Bobby Cannavale star as an estranged couple who could likely benefit from some counseling. It's a marriage story with a body count.
718-636-4100, bam.org
'MY NAME IS LUCY BARTON' Oklahoma (in previews; opens on Jan. 15). Elizabeth Street's novel, conceived by Rona Munro as a solo show, arrives on Broadway via the Manhattan Theater Club. Ben Brantley, who saw Laura Linney perform in the one-hander last year, wrote, "This is writing -- and acting -- that grows in power without your being aware of it, and the tears it elicits feel both surprising and natural."

Last Chance
'FREESTYLE LOVE SUPREME' at the Booth Theater (closes on Jan. 12). This improvised hip-hop comedy drops the mic. Created by Thomas Kail, Lin-Manuel Miranda and Anthony Veneziale, the show uses audience suggestions to create a different concert each night. Ben Brantley wrote that it "suggests that there's no feeling, thought or experience so anxious or so random that it can't be translated into infectious, neon-bright rhythms."
212-239-6200, freestylelovesupreme.com
'GREATER CLEMENTS' at the Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater at Lincoln Center Theater (closes on Jan. 19). Samuel D. Hunter's community tragedy, set in a small, industry-starved Idaho town, goes down the silver mines for the last time. Jesse Green compared it to a mine elevator: "creaky and skeletal but with intermittent access to wonderful things." He added, "If you are looking to cry, as I always am, 'Greater Clements' will give you more than one reason to do so."
212-239-6200, lct.org
'OKLAHOMA!' at Circle in the Square (closes on Jan. 19). The wind will whistle down Broadway for just a few more performances as Daniel Fish's audacious version of the Rodgers and Hammerstein classic comes to a close. "This isn't an act of plunder," Ben Brantley wrote, "but of reclamation. And a cozy old friend starts to seem like a figure of disturbing -- and exciting -- depth and complexity."
212-239-6200, oklahomabroadway.com
'ONE IN TWO' at the Pershing Square Signature Center (closes on Jan. 12). Donja R. Love's new drama about queer black men living with H.I.V. ends its run. Laura Collins-Hughes wrote that because of this New Group production by Stevie Walker-Webb, the play "has entered the world in a state of quiet glory, equal parts laughter and pain."
917-935-4242, thenewgroup.org
'SLAVE PLAY' at the John Golden Theater (closes on Jan. 19). A work that has changed the Broadway conversation around race, sex, audiences, ticket prices and even talkbacks, Jeremy O. Harris's barbed comedy ends its run. Jesse Green wrote that in its depiction of three interracial couples, Robert O'Hara's production "lets us all see ourselves in the muddle that is race in America now."
212-947-8844, slaveplaybroadway.com
'THE SOUND INSIDE' at Studio 54 (closes on Jan. 12). Adam Rapp's twisty drama about a creative writing professor (Mary-Louise Parker) and her student (Will Hochman) closes its books. Jesse Green, who had also seen the play at the Williamstown Theater Festival, described David Cromer's production as "even more resonant on Broadway: a tragedy about fiction, both the kind we read and the kind we live."

Texto completo: Bret Stephens offered his ideas on how to beat Donald Trump. Several readers offer theirs.
To the Editor:
Re "What Will It Take to Beat Donald Trump?," by Bret Stephens (column, nytimes.com, Dec. 26):
It will take a Democratic ticket (currently, I like Biden-Abrams) that will not offend too many and that will cause independents, moderate Republicans of conscience, young people and people of color to turn out in large numbers.
It will take a unified effort by all Democrats to work together for the greater good of the country, no matter their first choice for the nomination.
It will take unparalleled contributions to and volunteer work for the Democratic candidates.
It will take constant vigilance to respond to and counter false attacks and narratives from President Trump, Republicans and right-wing media.
It will take constant vigilance on Election Day to ensure a fair election and prevent cheating and voter suppression by Mr. Trump and Republicans.
It would seem that the worst and most corrupt president in American history would be easy to remove. Yet tyrants around the world have come to power and stayed, because people did not take the threat seriously and consoled themselves with false assurances -- "He can't win," or "It won't happen again" -- instead of doing the hard work to be sure it does not happen!
John E. Colbert
Arroyo Seco, N.M.
To the Editor:
The real strategic question in the next election is which platform -- moderate or progressive -- will resonate with the greatest number of voters in the battleground states. It is clear that Bret Stephens prefers the moderate -- a candidate focused on infrastructure spending, a carbon tax and "modest increases in taxes on the wealthy matched to the promise of a balanced budget."
However, I believe that the priorities favored by the more progressive candidates make them more electable: accessible and affordable health care, a "Manhattan Project" to combat climate change, regulations targeting corporate and government corruption, affordable college education and a more progressive tax system designed to decrease income inequality.
Michael Fishbein
Falmouth, Mass.
To the Editor:
While I agree with Bret Stephens's thesis that the defeat of Donald Trump in the 2020 election is not a given, I disagree with his prescription for a Democratic win. Yes, the more radical ideas of Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, which in fact might help Middle America the most, would never pass Congress and will never gain favor with conservative rural Americans.
But, likewise, his suggestions about carbon taxes, infrastructure spending and modest tax increases on the wealthy are unlikely to gain much traction with Middle America. The Democrats must figure out a way to address the frustration and anger of those living in small towns where economies have crumbled and a lack of job opportunities has opened the door for a demagogue like Mr. Trump.
To win, the Democrats must turn some of that red ocean of the middle of the country purple and deliver hope to so many left behind by the rapid changes caused by globalization, automation and other factors.
Ernest Stokely
Dallas
To the Editor:
Bret Stephens says the country needs a bar of soap to cleanse ourselves of the grime of the Trump administration. The Republican Party has one: former Gov. Bill Weld, who is running against President Trump and promises to balance the budget and address climate change, and is just fine with Roe v. Wade, marriage equality and legal marijuana. Plus he's a model of civility and has a sense of humor. He's the soap Mr. Stephens is looking for!

Texto completo: A reader cites the many ways that U.S. policy toward the Middle East has created more problems and terrorists.
To the Editor:
"A President's Mixed Messages Unsettle More Than Reassure" (news analysis, front page, Jan. 9) quotes an Iranian-American strategist who described President Trump's policy toward the Middle East over the past few months as "strategically incoherent." In fact, U.S. policy in the region has been incoherent for nearly two decades with the pursuit of policies that have created terrorists faster than they could be eliminated.
Since the 9/11 terrorist attacks, U.S. actions have worsened the stability of the Middle East, the Persian Gulf and Southwest Asia. Our prolonged stay in Afghanistan has been a strategic nightmare. George W. Bush's invasion of Iraq was doomed from the start, targeting the wrong enemy and creating conditions for the current instability throughout the region.
American policies have contributed to metastasizing Al Qaeda into a diffuse global movement and intensified radical militancy in the Muslim world. Meanwhile, the huge costs of the "global war on terror" have compromised our ability to fund key domestic programs.
Mr. Trump's actions toward Iran will increase the terrorist threat to the United States, creating more tactical opportunities for the Islamic State, and will allow President Vladimir Putin to improve Russia's relations with both Iran and Iraq.
Finally, Iran's nuclear ambitions have been revived, and the important co-signers of the 2015 nuclear accord have questioned and challenged the wisdom of U.S. actions.

Texto completo: If a Ukrainian passenger plane was shot down in Iran on Wednesday, as American officials believe, it would join a long list of civilian aircraft brought down by armed forces.
A Ukrainian airliner, a Boeing 737-800, went down in Iran on Wednesday morning, killing at least 176 people. American officials believe that the Iranians brought down the airliner by mistake, with two missiles fired from an Iranian air defense system, the SA-15.
Here are some of the most prominent passenger jets to be shot down -- whether accidentally or, in some cases, deliberately:
July 17, 2014: Malaysia Airlines Flight 17
MH17 was flying from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, when it was blown out of the sky over eastern Ukraine, killing 298 people. In June, an international investigative team charged four people, including three with ties to Russian intelligence.
Moscow has consistently denied any involvement in the disaster, but Western countries and experts have blamed Russian-backed separatists.
Oct. 4, 2001: Siberia Airlines Flight 1812
Seventy-eight people, most of them Russian émigrés to Israel, died when the flight from Tel Aviv to Novosibirsk exploded and plunged into the Black Sea off the Russian coast.
Four minutes earlier, two long-range antiaircraft missiles were fired during a Ukrainian air defense exercise off the Black Sea's Crimean coast. Ukraine's president later said that he accepted investigators' finding that his country's military had accidentally destroyed the Russian airliner.
July 3, 1988: Iran Air Flight 655
A United States Navy warship in the Persian Gulf shot down an Iranian passenger plane that the Navy said it mistook for a jet fighter, killing all 290 people onboard. The Iran Air Airbus A300 was flying over the Strait of Hormuz while the warship, the Vincennes, a 9,600-ton missile cruiser, was being engaged by Iranian gunboats.
The Americans, who were following radar readings, wrongly thought they saw a hostile F-14 jet fighter, and downed the plane with a surface-to-air missile.
Sept. 1, 1983: Korean Air Lines Flight 007
A Soviet fighter jet shot down KAL 007 after the airliner strayed off course and over Soviet territory, killing 269 passengers and crew members and prompting several theories.
The Soviet Union contended the jet was on a spying mission, which the United States denied. The United States, Japan and the Soviet Union searched the Sea of Okhotsk for the black box recorder but said they were unable to find it.
The episode evoked the Soviet downing of Korean Air Lines Flight 902 in 1978, which had a different fate: All but two passengers on that flight survived.
June 27, 1980: Itavia Flight 870
The crash of Itavia Flight 870, known as the Ustica affair, killed all 81 people aboard and produced legions of conspiracy theories in Italy. The airliner was entering the final leg of a routine trip from Bologna, Italy, to Palermo, Sicily, when it suddenly plunged into the Tyrrhenian Sea near the small island of Ustica.
In 2013, Italy's highest court ruled that the government had to compensate the families of some of the victims, implicitly acknowledging the most widely accepted theory behind the crash: that a missile fired by a warplane had hit the twin-engine McDonnell Douglas DC-9. The court did not say where that missile came from.
Sept. 3, 1978: Air Rhodesia Flight 825
Feb. 12, 1979: Air Rhodesia Flight 827
In similar episodes, rebel forces in what was then Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe, brought down two aircraft within five minutes of their takeoff from Kariba.
Both were apparently hit by Soviet‐made Strela heat‐seeking missiles. Altogether, more than 100 people died in the two episodes.
Feb. 21, 1973: Libyan Arab Airlines Flight 114
A Boeing 727-200 en route from Tripoli, Libya, to Cairo via Benghazi, Libya, was shot down by Israeli fighter aircraft over the Sinai Desert. Just five of the 113 passengers survived.
Israel said that the plane had flown over Israeli military concentrations along the Suez Canal and over a military airfield in Sinai, which was then occupied by Israel, which claimed it downed the plane to thwart a possible act of terrorism.
July 27, 1955: El Al Flight 402
Bulgarian fighter jets shot down a wayward plane that was traveling from London to Tel Aviv and had crossed into Bulgarian airspace during a storm, killing all 58 people on board. Under international pressure, Bulgaria -- then part of the Soviet bloc -- eventually gave Israel $ 200,000.
July 23, 1954: Cathay Pacific VR-HEU
Chinese fighter jets shot down a British-made DC-3 Skymaster operated by Cathay Pacific Airlines, the airline based in Hong Kong, then a British territory. Ten of the 18 people on board died. China later apologized, saying it mistook the flight traveling from Bangkok for a Taiwanese fighter jet and that it would consider paying compensation.
A few days later, the episode grew more complicated when United States Navy aircraft searching for survivors clashed with Chinese military planes and shot down two of them.
Aug. 24, 1938: The Kweilin Incident
Five Japanese military planes shot down a Chinese-American owned DC-2, known as Kweilin, soon after it had left Hong Kong for Chongqing. China and Japan were at war at the time.
Fourteen people died; many of them had machine-gun wounds. The American pilot survived.

Texto completo: Our guide to the city's best classical music and opera happening this weekend and in the week ahead.
CHAMBER MUSIC SOCIETY OF LINCOLN CENTER at the Kaplan Penthouse (Jan. 16, 7:30 p.m.). Much of the society's output still comes from the "long 19th century," as with a concert of Suk, Janacek, Debussy and Brahms at Alice Tully Hall in the coming week (Tuesday, 7:30 p.m.). But seeing it explore more recent music with increasing enthusiasm is gratifying. A few years ago, it would never have scheduled this concert of electronic music, which includes Saariaho's "Trois Rivières" and Stockhausen's "Kontakte"; praise be that it now does.
212-875-5788, chambermusicsociety.org
LUCY DHEGRAE at National Sawdust (Jan. 11, 8 p.m.). For the second concert in Dhegrae's valuable Processing Series, which is her artistic response to the trauma of an assault, the singer performs works by Machaut, Poulenc, Eve Beglarian, Amadeus Regucera, Philippe Leroux, Georges Aperghis and Peter Kramer.
646-779-8455, nationalsawdust.org
'ELLEN WEST' at the Gelsey Kirkland Arts Center (Jan. 14-15, 8 p.m.; through Jan. 19). Frank Bidart's poem is the libretto for this Ricky Ian Gordon opera, which examines the lives of Ellen West and her psychiatrist, Ludwig Binswanger. Lidiya Yankovskaya conducts a production by Emma Griffin, featuring the singers Jennifer Zetlan and Nathan Gunn. Among the other performances at the utterly essential Prototype festival in the coming week is the premiere of "Magdalene," which sets poetry by Marie Howe to music by 14 women in a creation by Danielle Birrittella and Zoe Aja Moore.

[ Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead. ]
LONGLEASH at Flushing Town Hall (Jan. 10, 7:30 p.m.). The 250th anniversary of Beethoven's birth approaches, bringing with it all kinds of opportunities to think about what the composer means for us today -- or what, perhaps, he ought to mean. This progressive young trio puts him into context by performing two of his trios with works responding to them: John Zorn's "Ghosts" and Reiko Füting's "Free -- Whereof -- Wherefore," which receives its premiere. Appearing as part of the Five Boroughs Music Festival, the ensemble also plays at Madison Avenue Presbyterian Church later in the weekend (Sunday, 3 p.m.).
5bmf.org
NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC at David Geffen Hall (Jan. 15-16, 7:30 p.m.; through Jan. 21). Gustavo Dudamel, the shock-haired music director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, is on the podium at Lincoln Center for the next two weeks, starting with this program of Ives's "The Unanswered Question," Dvorak's Symphony No. 9 and Esteban Benzecry's Piano Concerto, "Universos infinitos," with the soloist Sergio Tiempo. Schubert and Mahler are on the bill for Dudamel's second round of concerts (Jan. 23-25).
212-875-5656, nyphil.org
'LA TRAVIATA' at the Metropolitan Opera (Jan. 10 and 14, 7:30 p.m.; through March 19). Michael Mayer's production returns for the first time since its debut during the 2018-19 season, for the first of two runs with two separate casts. Through Feb. 7, Karel Mark Chichon conducts Aleksandra Kurzak as Violetta, Dmytro Popov as Alfredo and Quinn Kelsey as Germont. Lisette Oropesa takes over as Violetta beginning on Feb. 26.

Texto completo: The travel ban was issued as Lebanon begins to consider how to treat the former executive facing financial charges in Japan.
BEIRUT, Lebanon -- A day after commanding global attention with a news conference packed with reporters, Carlos Ghosn was ordered by the Lebanese attorney general to stay in the country as officials begin to consider how to treat the former executive charged with financial misconduct in Japan.
Mr. Ghosn, a fugitive who skipped bail in Japan and fled to Lebanon two weeks ago, was summoned for questioning on Thursday at the instigation of Japanese officials. The attorney general of Lebanon's Court of Cassation, Judge Ghassan Oueidat, allowed Mr. Ghosn to keep a residency permit, but barred him from traveling outside Lebanon, according to Lebanese state media.
Mr. Ghosn's travel options were already restricted. Interpol, the international law enforcement agency, last week issued a so-called red notice for the apprehension of Mr. Ghosn at Japan's request. A red notice is simply a request for help, and countries can act as they wish, but it raised the threat of arrest whenever he traveled.
Until Mr. Ghosn slipped out of Japan on Dec. 29, evading what was supposed to be the close surveillance required by his bail conditions, Japan was set to put him on trial on charges of financial misconduct during his tenure as the head of a global auto alliance including Nissan, Renault and Mitsubishi.
Representatives of Mr. Ghosn could not be reached Thursday.
In his news conference on Wednesday, a defiant Mr. Ghosn denied all the charges against him, saying he had documents that would prove his innocence. He assailed the Japanese justice system for what he described as its inhumane treatment of him as a defendant and accused his former colleagues at Nissan of framing him.
Though free of Japanese court dates and prison cells, Mr. Ghosn is now confined to a small country where his only known business interest is a winery.
At least many in that country seem to be rooting for him. He has long been lionized in Lebanon for his success abroad, and Mr. Ghosn met with some top officials soon after reaching Beirut.
Arriving in a country gripped by economic and political tumult, Mr. Ghosn's name has been floated for everything from president to central bank governor.
On Thursday, Walid Jumblatt, the leader of the Druze religious minority and a powerful politician, was the latest to posit Mr. Ghosn as a savior of sorts. He tweeted, perhaps sarcastically, in French that appointing Mr. Ghosn as minister of energy "would be a good idea."
He also said, with apparent approval, that Mr. Ghosn had "transformed from a victim into a defender of justice."
For now, Mr. Ghosn has put a measure of distance between himself and Japanese prosecutors; Lebanon does not have an extradition treaty with Japan, and neither do France and Brazil, the other two countries where he holds citizenship.
Lebanese officials have proposed that Japan pursue its charges against Mr. Ghosn in Lebanese courts, and Mr. Oueidat's office is awaiting a request from Japan to take further action on Mr. Ghosn's case.
But Japan may not entrust its charges to the Lebanese justice system. It is unclear what will happen to the case if Japan does not do so.
On Thursday, Lebanese prosecutors also asked Mr. Ghosn about having visited Israel, which Lebanese law forbids its citizens from doing.
But a Lebanese lawyer, Diala Chehade, said on Thursday that because more than 10 years had passed since Mr. Ghosn's 2008 trip to Israel, the statute of limitations had already passed. As for the Japanese financial charges, she said, experience had taught her not to wait for a quick resolution.
"In Lebanon's bureaucracy, Ghosn's case will take at least a year, going back and forth," she said.

Lawmakers In Britain Give Brexit Green Light

Texto completo: A House of Commons, once bitterly split on how and whether to leave the European Union, agreed with little drama on withdrawal at the end of the month.
LONDON -- After more than a year of drama, recrimination and tense, late-night votes, British lawmakers signed off on Thursday, with minimal fuss and no fanfare, on legislation to take their country out of the European Union at the end of the month.
The vote in the House of Commons is not quite the final parliamentary moment of Britain's extraordinary Brexit story -- the bill will be considered next by the unelected second chamber, the House of Lords -- but the suspense that surrounded many previous votes was entirely absent.
Even if the Lords amend the bill, Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his Conservative Party now have a large majority in the Commons and could overturn any changes -- swiftly, if necessary. The legislation is almost certain to be completed and written into law next week.
Only a few dozen members of Parliament attended the opening statements of the debate on Thursday -- in contrast to the packed chamber for previous discussions on Brexit -- but by the time the debate drew to a close hours later, most of the lawmakers had trickled into the room.
They approved the bill on a vote of 330 to 231, drawing a long-awaited line under the heated debate over a Brexit plan that convulsed British politics and divided the nation.
Once the exit plan has also been approved by the European Parliament, the stage will be set for Britain to reverse more than four decades of integration with its continental neighbors, a journey that began when it entered what was then called the European Economic Community in January 1973.
What comes next remains far from clear -- the deal set to go into effect on Jan. 31 establishes a transition period, and the two sides are preparing for negotiations on a long-term trade deal and on other future ties. Those talks are expected to revive many of the cross-Channel tensions in evidence since the 2016 referendum in which Britain voted to leave the European Union, convulsing the country's politics.
Since then two prime ministers have lost their jobs, as have many of the lawmakers whose impassioned dispute over Britain's future brought the country to a state of political paralysis.
That deadlock was broken by last month's general election, won by Mr. Johnson with his pledge to "get Brexit done."
His critics point out that the painful job of untangling decades of European ties now merely moves to a second, more complicated, phase.
But it is hard to overstate the change in the political mood from last year, when Parliament was in ferment and analysts were unable to predict when -- or even whether -- Brexit would take place.
With the news dominated by Iran and the future of Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan, debates and votes on Brexit in Parliament this week have largely been ignored by a British media that once focused obsessively on parliamentary maneuvers.
Thanks to his large majority in Parliament, Mr. Johnson can easily pass all his legislation, and opposition lawmakers are powerless even to influence the coming negotiation on trade and other ties with the European Union.
Before the general election, lawmakers rejected Mr. Johnson's timetable for scrutinizing the legislation as grossly insufficient. But on Tuesday the Brexit debate finished more than three hours ahead of its allotted time.
On Thursday some of the old divisions resurfaced. "This is a great moment in our democracy," said William Cash, a Conservative lawmaker and veteran critic of the European Union. "Now we will be able to govern ourselves."
The Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, said it was "time to get Brexit done," using his Conservative party's election slogan, and added, "this bill does so."
By contrast Alistair Carmichael, a lawmaker with the pro-European Liberal Democrats, argued that the government's Brexit plan "is going to leave us poorer and more isolated on the world stage."
But the tempo of the debate resembled a slowly deflating balloon, with the outcome of the vote a foregone conclusion.
Big constitutional questions remain, and on Wednesday the Scottish Parliament refused to approve the government's plan -- a largely symbolic act that nonetheless illustrated the opposition to Brexit in Scotland, where there is growing pressure for another referendum on independence.
But Britain is now on course to leave the European Union 10 months after the first date -- March 29, 2019 -- on which it was scheduled to do so. The real effects will not be felt before January 2021, however, because Britain will be in the transition period until then, still under the European Union rulebook.
On Wednesday Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the union's executive arm, the European Commission, warned that this time frame was too short to complete a comprehensive trade deal, and that the cost of a clear break without an agreement in place would be new barriers to trade and a distant partnership.
That warning was repeated on Thursday by Michel Barnier, the European Union's chief Brexit negotiator, who said that Brussels would continue to prepare for a situation in which no deal is struck by the end of the year and tariffs and quotas are imposed.
It would be impossible to agree on everything on the table this year, Mr. Barnier said, while adding that some issues would need to be decided. These include the politically sensitive question of fishing rights, and an agreement on the general tax, antitrust, social and environmental rules for manufacturers, known as "level playing field" provisions.
European officials are determined to prevent Britain from gaining preferential access to continental European markets while undercutting them through lighter regulation.
As for Britain's objectives, those will be determined by Mr. Johnson's government, and several lawmakers lamented the fact that they will have no influence over the British negotiating strategy.

Tireless 'human jukebox' of rockabilly music

Texto completo: Sleepy LaBeef, a rockabilly and country singer who began his career in the mid-1950s and was known as a 'human jukebox' for his seemingly limitless repertoire of songs, died Dec.-26 at his home in Siloam Springs, Ark. He was 84.
His wife, Linda LaBeff, announced the death on Facebook but did not cite a cause; LaBeff was the singer's real surname. He had heart bypass surgery in 2003 but continued to perform until shortly before his death.
An imposing man who stood 6-feet-6 and weighed more than 250 pounds, Mr. LaBeef sang in a deep, drawling baritone. His record sales were never huge, but his live performances helped energize a resurgence of rockabilly music in the 1970s and '80s.
Mr. LaBeef began his career as a gospel singer but changed course when he heard Elvis Presley's recordings on Sun Records in 1954.
'I said, 'Hey, this is crazy. This is what I'm singing,' ' he told the Boston Globe in 1983. 'Except that he was singing blues lyrics and country lyrics with the same gospel beat I was using.'
He knew thousands of songs from the rock-and-roll, gospel, blues, country and pop songbooks, which he drew on for marathon medleys. A waltz might suddenly give way to a shuffle and then just as suddenly to a rocker. It all depended on how he read the audience's mood. The crowds loved it, but for his backup band it was daunting.
On Facebook, rockabilly guitarist Deke Dickerson recalled that one nightclub turned the electricity off when Mr. LaBeef continued playing after last call. Dickerson wrote that Mr. LaBeef's shows 'would consist of him performing for 3 or 4 hours straight, no breaks, with short- and long-term band members holding on for dear life, often not knowing the songs as Sleepy plowed through them like a mule plowing through hard and rocky Arkansas farmland.'
'It's about having fun,' Mr. LaBeef once said, 'not necessarily about teaching my backing band a lesson. They'll learn as they go, on-the-job training.'
On New Year's Day 1977, his van caught fire en route to a show in Amesbury, Mass. Although his clothes were destroyed, he made it to his gig at Alan's Fifth Wheel, a truck stop honky-tonk. The owners offered him a residency.
Critic Peter Guralnick, who lived nearby, heard Mr. LaBeef many times at the truck stop, where he appeared for several years. In his book 'Lost Highway,' Guralnick wrote that Mr. LaBeef 'is possessed not only of an encyclopedic knowledge of the field but of the flair, originality, and conviction to put the music across as well. At this point, I can't count the number of times I've seen him perform, but I've never seen Sleepy do a set that was less than entertaining, nor have I known him to play the same set twice.'
Thomas Paulsley LaBeff was born July-20, 1935, in Smackover, Ark., the youngest of 10 children in a farming family. He reportedly got the nickname Sleepy because of a lazy eye.
After trading a rifle for his first guitar, he began playing in church. His early influences included religious singers Sister Rosetta Tharpe, 'Cile Turner and Brother Claude Ely. In addition to guitar, he played fiddle, piano and upright bass.
He worked as a land surveyor in Houston, beginning in his late teens, and sang in gospel groups before making his first recordings in 1957. He adopted the stage name LaBeef in 1965.
His marriages to Louise Barstow and Oquita Richards ended in divorce. Survivors include his wife of 41 years, the former Linda Cerny of Siloam Springs; five children; and 12 grandchildren.
Mr. LaBeef starred in a low-budget exploitation movie, 'The Exotic Ones' (1968), also called 'The Monster and the Stripper.' Undoubtedly cast for his size and girth, he portrayed a swamp monster captured by hunters and exhibited in a strip club. 'Sleepy LaBeef Rides Again,' a documentary film about his career, was released in 2013.
His early records from the late 1950s, mostly for small labels and usually credited to Sleepy (or Tommy) LaBeff, are prized by collectors for their raw spontaneity and their rarity " an unfortunate reflection that they didn't sell.
Although the song 'Blackland Farmer' briefly entered the country charts in 1971, Mr. LaBeef never had a big hit. Throughout the 1970s and '80s, he recorded for Rounder Records and the reactivated Sun label, but he felt something was often missing from the albums.
'When you go into a studio, you hope many people are going to hear your record, but you're still singing to an engineer and microphones,' he told the New York Times in 1991.
'But really, it's hard for me,' he said. 'It's much more thrilling to get onstage and perform to people and see them get into what you're doing.'

Texto completo: 'Like a Boss' is the perfect airplane movie: something that won't distract you terribly much while you work the New York Times crossword puzzle during a long flight, periodically looking up at the screen when the 2-year-old in the seat behind you kicks the back of your chair. Oh well. At least that way you won't fall asleep.
In a warm movie theater with reclining lounge chairs, the risk of drifting off is far greater " which is, quite frankly, shocking, considering this is a Tiffany Haddish movie.
With Rose Byrne, the normally hilarious Haddish plays the co-owner of a small, bricks-and-mortar cosmetics shop named, after the childhood best friends, Mel - Mia's. (You know: the kind of quaint, stand-alone boutique selling hand-mixed foundation and blush that is ground using a mortar and pestle " the kind of place that doesn't actually exist, except on screen.)
A half-million dollars in debt, Mel and Mia are miraculously bailed out by Claire Luna (Salma Hayek), a predatory makeup mogul who immediately " and predictably " begins driving a psychological wedge between the business partners, playing Byrne's Mel (the money-minded one) off against Haddish's Mia (the creative one) so that Claire herself can assume a controlling interest in their company.
But the power of female friendship is too great, in a movie that keeps hammering that point home, between jokes about sex, marijuana and a baby-shower cake with a doll's head emerging from what looks like an anatomically correct 3-D model you'd find in an OB/GYN's office.

During a preview screening, the laughs were few and far between, even counting that cake scene. The roster of otherwise funny supporting actors " Billy Porter, Jennifer Coolidge, Karan Soni, Jimmy O. Yang " does little to leaven this flat loaf, which isn't just flavorless but half-baked. Case in point: Mel and Mia's product that initially draws the attention of Claire, for instance, is a single-use makeup kit called the One Night Stand, which isn't just a dumb idea, but a wasteful one. As wasteful as the film is of its talent.
As for director Miguel Arteta, a filmmaker who, from his 1997 breakout, 'Star Maps,' to 2017's 'Beatriz at Dinner,' has never been afraid to be edgy, even transgressive, it's a mystery why he would make this film, when Hollywood is full of no-name hacks willing to do the job.
True to its workplace-themed title, 'Like a Boss' feels like a chore someone was handed. Perhaps oddest of all, Mel - Mia's company is all about selling makeup that doesn't hide a woman's natural beauty. But 'Boss' trowels on the clown white, strenuously reaching for nonexistent yuks instead of trusting in the talent of its likable but ill-used cast.

Texto completo: Buck Henry, a comedian who created the satirical spy sitcom 'Get Smart' with Mel Brooks, was a frequent early host of 'Saturday Night Live' and turned 'plastics' into a countercultural catchword with his Oscar-nominated screenplay for 'The Graduate,' died Jan. 8 at a hospital in Los Angeles. He was 89.
The cause was a heart attack, said his wife, Irene Ramp.
A restless entertainer, Mr. Henry dabbled in improvisational comedy as well as theater, television and film. He received an Academy Award nomination for co-directing the 1978 afterlife comedy 'Heaven Can Wait' with star Warren Beatty; wrote scripts for the sex farce 'Candy' (1968), based on the novel by Terry Southern, and the Barbra Streisand screwball comedies 'The Owl and the Pussycat' (1970) and 'What's Up, Doc?' (1972); and appeared as a droll supporting actor in nearly every film he helped create, including a turn as an anxiety-inducing hotel clerk in 'The Graduate' (1967).
'I never wanted to stay at anything very long,' he told the New York Times in 2002, while performing in a Broadway revival of the Paul Osborn comedy 'Morning's at Seven.' 'I'm moderately lazy, and I'm interested in much too large a list of things other than my career.'
Mr. Henry maintained a close association with 'Saturday Night Live,' where he hosted 10 episodes in the show's first five seasons and helped establish its transgressive brand of humor.
He played Lord Douchebag, an 18th-century English nobleman who observed that 'Parliament has always had its share of Douchebags, and it always will,' and he portrayed a film actor who abuses a 'stunt baby,' throwing the crying infant " a prop " against a grandfather clock before flinging it through a glass window.
The skit, and a follow-up that featured a howling 'stunt puppy,' triggered a torrent of angry letters from viewers. But the segment seemed almost timid compared with Mr. Henry's depiction of Uncle Roy, a Polaroid-wielding babysitter who encourages his young wards (Laraine Newman and Gilda Radner) to lift their dresses and hunt for 'buried treasure' in his pants.
Created by writers Anne Beatts and Rosie Shuster, the recurring segment first aired in 1978. At Mr. Henry's urging, the writers crafted a closing joke in which Uncle Roy slyly gazed into the camera and insisted that he was not 'one in a million,' but rather that 'there's more of me than you might suspect,' a reference to what Mr. Henry took to be the widespread nature of pedophilia.
'In other words,' Mr. Henry said in 'Live From New York,' a 2002 oral history of SNL, 'I talked myself into the fact that we were performing " or that I was performing " a public service.'
Off camera, Mr. Henry cultivated a reputation as a dry-witted comedian-intellectual, claiming to read 200 periodicals each year.
He was 'the funniest and most serious guy I'd ever met " simultaneously,' said the late director Mike Nichols, a childhood friend with whom Mr. Henry collaborated on an adaptation of Joseph Heller's 'Catch-22' (1970) and, somewhat less successfully, 'The Day of the Dolphin' (1973), a thriller about a plot to assassinate the president using English-speaking dolphins.
'The Graduate,' based on Charles Webb's 1963 novella, remained their most enduring project. The film made a star of Dustin Hoffman, who played Benjamin Braddock, a college graduate who has an affair with his parents' friend Mrs. Robinson (Anne Bancroft). Mixing wry comedy, sexual drama and a soundtrack by Simon - Garfunkel, the film captured the alienation and rebelliousness of the era and was later ranked No. 7 on the American Film Institute's list of the 100 best American movies.
Much to his frustration, Mr. Henry shared his Oscar nomination for 'The Graduate' with Calder Willingham, who had worked on previous attempts to adapt the novel and sued to receive partial credit for the screenplay.
The book provided much of the film's dialogue " including the oft-quoted line 'Mrs. Robinson, you are trying to seduce me. Aren't you?' " but it was Mr. Henry who devised the 'plastics' exchange, in which a business associate of Benjamin's parents offers career advice to the lost young man.
'I just want to say one word to you, just one word,' the businessman declares. 'Plastics . . . There's a great future in plastics. Think about it. Will you think about it?'
The suggestion neatly encapsulated what some viewers saw as the artificiality and materialism of older generations.
'I was trying to find a word that summed up a kind of stultifying, silly, conversation-closing effort of one generation to talk to another. Plastics was the obvious one,' Mr. Henry told the Orlando Sentinel in 1992. 'I was embarrassed some years later. I got to know some people in the plastics business, and they were really nice.'
Henry Zuckerman was born in New York on Dec. 9, 1930. (Long known as Buck, after a grandfather, he later legally changed his name, his wife said.) An only child, he invented a pair of imaginary siblings, telling friends they lived in New Jersey because he assumed nobody would ever go there to visit. His father was a prominent stockbroker, and his mother was silent-film actress Ruth Taylor, who played the flighty Lorelei Lee in the 1928 gold-digging comedy 'Gentlemen Prefer Blondes.' (Marilyn Monroe portrayed Lee in the 1953 screen musical version.)
Mr. Henry graduated from Dartmouth College in 1952 and performed with an Army theater group before beginning a long, Benjamin Braddock-like period of what Mr. Henry described as 'vigorous, total unemployment, characterized by a great deal of sleep.'
That lifestyle changed around 1960, when he began performing with the Premise, a Greenwich Village improv group, and developed an offstage alter ego as G. Clifford Prout, the prudish president of a spoof organization called the Society for Indecency to Naked Animals.
Founded by prankster Alan Abel, the group took comic aim at 'uptight, silly morality chasers,' as Mr. Henry put it. He declared that 'a nude horse is a rude horse,' attempted to place boxer shorts on a baby elephant and was covered by credulous news programs including Walter Cronkite's 'CBS Evening News.'
The exposure helped him land writing jobs for TV variety programs and appearances on 'That Was the Week That Was,' a satirical news show. With Ted Flicker, founder of the Premise, he also wrote his first movie, 'The Troublemaker' (1964), a comedy about a farmer who arrives in New York to start a coffee shop and realizes he must bribe officials to cut through red tape.
The film bombed " 'the world wasn't really waiting for the final definitive attack on the cabaret-licensing system in New York City,' Mr. Henry quipped " but that same year he was paired by a production company with Brooks in an effort to duplicate the success of the spy series 'The Man From U.N.C.L.E.'
The result was 'Get Smart,' a sitcom featuring Don Adams as bumbling secret agent Maxwell Smart. The series debuted in 1965 and resulted in an Emmy Award for writing for Mr. Henry, who served as the story editor for two of its five seasons. (Mr. Henry's relationship with the better-known Brooks frayed over the issue of equal billing, with credits listing the show as 'By Mel Brooks with Buck Henry.')
Mr. Henry's first marriage ended in divorce, and in 2008 he married Irene Ramp, his sole immediate survivor.
His later film credits included the critically disappointing 1980 political farce 'First Family,' which was written and directed by Mr. Henry and featured Bob Newhart as an ineffectual U.S. president, and the screenplay for 'To Die For' (1995), a mockumentary about a murderously ambitious newscaster played by Nicole Kidman.
Mr. Henry also continued acting, appearing as Tina Fey's father in the NBC sitcom '30 Rock' and as himself in Robert Altman's 1992 movie 'The Player,' a Hollywood satire that began with Mr. Henry pitching a producer on a sequel to 'The Graduate.'
The movie, he said, would be set 25 years after the original and would feature a stroke-impaired Mrs. Robinson living with her daughter, Elaine, who had by then married Braddock; Julia Roberts would play their adult daughter.
'I thought . . . it would stop people from ever calling me about a sequel,' he told the film magazine Cinéaste in 2001. 'Instead, of course, the opposite happened. There was a big screening . . . and my scene got a big laugh. In the lobby afterwards, a studio guy came over and said, 'Good joke, good joke. Now let's talk serious about it.' So dumb ideas never die.'

Texto completo: They say intelligence points to erroneous strike; Tehran dismisses claim

MOSCOW " Western leaders sketched out Thursday what they say was the fate of Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752 " apparently downed by an Iranian missile, possibly fired by mistake, as the plane with 176 people aboard climbed above Tehran's outskirts.
The assessments " based on intelligence reports from the United States, Canada and elsewhere " were met with quick dismissals from Iran and suggested deepening divides over the unfolding investigation of Wednesday's crash, which killed all aboard.
In Ottawa, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said intelligence analyses indicated that a surface-to-air missile hit the plane in what could have been an 'unintentional' act.
In Washington, U.S. officials expressed 'high confidence' that the Boeing 737-800, bound for the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv, was targeted by air-defense systems as Iranian forces were on high alert. President Trump said the downing of the aircraft was probably a 'mistake.'
Trudeau's comments " as his nation mourned 63 Canadians on the flight and dozens of others with links to the country " came after U.S. officials said the plane was apparently hit by an SA-15 surface-to-air missile, part of a Russian-made air defense system also known as a Tor system.
The U.S. officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters, offered no other details on the circumstances that led to the possible missile firing Wednesday, which came about four hours after Iran launched ballistic missiles into Iraq against U.S. targets in retaliation for the killing of Iranian military commander Qasem Soleimani.
Iran has repeatedly rejected theories of a missile strike. A military spokesman on Wednesday called it 'ridiculous.' Iran's state-run Islamic Republic News Agency labeled the claims Thursday a 'psychological operation' waged by the Pentagon.
As Western officials built their case, it was unclear whether Iran would publicly acknowledge the direction of the probe or offer further details on the minutes after the flight left the runway, rose toward 8,000 feet, then burst into flames without a distress call.
And with the region on edge, Iranian military leaders could be put in a difficult spot, with commanders left to face possible questions about procedures or even the locations of antiaircraft sites.
Trudeau, speaking to reporters, said the missile-strike conclusion was based on 'intelligence from multiple sources, including our allies and our own intelligence.'
'The evidence indicates the plane was shot down by an Iranian surface-to-air missile. This may well have been unintentional,' he said, without giving further details.
Trump, speaking Thursday at the White House, also said the passenger jet could have been downed in error. 'Well, I have my suspicions,' he said. 'I don't want to say that, because other people have those suspicions also. . . . Somebody could've made a mistake on the other side.'
'Some people say it was mechanical,' Trump added. 'Personally, I don't think that's even a question.'
In London, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson joined the growing consensus around the missile strike. He cited a 'body of information that the flight was shot down by an Iranian surface-to-air missile.'
The Washington Post obtained a video that allegedly shows the moment the airliner is struck in midair. The video, first published by the New York Times, purportedly shows a missile intercepting the aircraft, followed by a loud boom.
Flight tracking data from Flightradar24 showed the Ukrainian airliner taking off from Tehran Imam Khomeini International Airport in a northwesterly direction before losing contact near the suburb of Parand.
Michael Elleman, director of the Non-proliferation and Nuclear Policy Program at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said the general area about 12 miles northwest of Tehran's airport is known to be filled with Iranian missile facilities, which could have been protected by antiaircraft systems. The Iranian government may have suspected the missile sites could be targets for a retaliation by the United States.
The Tor system dates to the Cold War and can target planes, helicopters, drones or incoming missiles. Russia has exported the system to a number of countries, including Iran in 2005. It is designed to hit targets in the short-to-medium range.
Ukrainian investigators A team of 45 experts and search-and-rescue personnel from Ukraine arrived in Tehran early Thursday to participate in the probe, as well as to identify and repatriate the bodies of the 11 Ukrainians aboard, including all nine crew members.
Before the U.S. and Canadian statements, Ukrainian investigators had said they were also looking at a range of theories " including the possibility of antiaircraft fire.
Oleksiy Danilov, secretary of Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council, wrote on Facebook that his team wanted to search for possible debris from a Tor air-defense missile, after seeing online reports about the discovery of possible fragments of one near the crash site.

Ukraine is familiar with the risks that antiaircraft weapons can pose to civilian aircraft in times of conflict.
In July 2014, Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was downed by a missile shot from a Russian-made Buk surface-to-air missile system from rebel territory in eastern Ukraine. The attack on the Boeing 777, which was passing over the conflict zone while flying from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur, killed all 298 people aboard.
A joint investigative team from Australia, Belgium, Malaysia, the Netherlands and Ukraine identified a Russian military unit in charge of the antiaircraft missile system and has pursued prosecution of Russian and Ukrainian citizens allegedly involved. Russia has denied any involvement in the incident.
Danilov said that Ukraine's investigative commission for the Tehran crash includes specialists who helped investigate the Flight 17 crash site. The government in Kyiv has also suspended all Ukrainian flights over Iranian and Iraqi airspace.
Iran's air-defense structure The responsibility for air defense traditionally falls to Iran's Air Defense Force command, said Saeid Golkar, a political science professor at the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga who has studied Iranian security forces for 20 years.
Orders to mobilize the country's air defense are given by a central command center, which includes air-defense batteries controlled by Iran's two armed forces: the regular military and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. Within this system, the Revolutionary Guard is also in control of its own air-defense systems and has the capability of acting without authorization, Golkar said.
'It is possible that the IRGC acted alone?' Golkar asked.
'If you asked me if its possible if someone mistakenly shot it down, I'd say yes, because of the whole informality of the system,' Golkar said.
The passengers on the plane were mostly Iranians but also included Europeans and Canadians.
The Iranian report said the flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder were recovered but were damaged. Abedzadeh has said Iran will not share those 'black boxes' with Boeing, but other countries have been invited to participate in the investigation in accordance with international guidelines.
John Cox, an airline safety consultant and former pilot, said Iranian officials have indicated they will conduct their probe in accordance with International Civil Aviation Organization Annex 13, which outlines the process by which international crashes are investigated. Under the protocols, the United States has a right to participate in the probe because the jet was built and certified in the country.
The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board on Thursday declined to say whether it will participate in the investigation. However, two people with knowledge of the investigation but not authorized to speak publicly said the safety body had been asked by the ICAO to take part in the probe.
Still, U.S. sanctions against Iran, which include limits on travel and information-sharing, will complicate any U.S. involvement.
NTSB officials would have to seek a license from the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control to travel to Iran, a process can take months or even years, experts say. And even if they secure a license, U.S. officials may still be limited in what information they can share with Iranian officials.

Texto completo: Sylvia Jukes Morris, a British-born biographer of first lady Edith Roosevelt and playwright-diplomat Clare Boothe Luce, whose lives she chronicled in lucid prose and meticulous detail, died Jan.-5 in Bridgnorth, England. She was 84.
The cause was cancer, said her sister and sole immediate survivor, Pauline Pennington. Mrs. Morris died less than eight months after her husband, fellow biographer Edmund Morris, who was 78. A resident of Kent, Conn., she was staying with her sister in Bridgnorth for Christmas.
Mrs. Morris came to biography somewhat late in life, while helping Edmund prepare his first book, 'The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt' (1979), which won a Pulitzer and National Book Award. The Morrises had previously collaborated on travel cassettes for Trans World Airlines, researching European history and culture for jet-setting tourists. It was unsatisfying but life-altering work, Mrs. Morris told The Washington Post last year. 'We realized that we were biographers at heart.'
Neither had graduated from college, although both had literary temperaments; Edmund said that he fell in love with Mrs. Morris after spotting a worn leatherbound set of Boswell's 'Life of Samuel Johnson' in her apartment. She was the kind of reader who devoured five books a week and could rip through a 500-page volume of Harold Nicolson's diaries on a 3 1/2 -hour car ride " then recommend a certain passage from memory, her sister said, 'on page 37, three-quarters of the way down.'
Mrs. Morris helped research and edit 'The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt,' which spurred her interest in the former Edith Kermit Carow, who married Roosevelt in 1886 after the death of his first wife. 'There's not much known about her,' Edmund said, which Mrs. Morris seemed to take as a challenge, poring over the first lady's letters, diaries and papers to write 'Edith Kermit Roosevelt: Portrait of a First Lady' (1980).
'If Theodore Roosevelt's turbulent life can be described as cyclonic,' she wrote, 'his wife was the still center of the storm. Reserved to the point of aloofness, and given to the sternest self-discipline, Edith was a lifelong enigma even to members of her family. Yet no one denied her power and influence. She was 'a sort of feminine luminiferous ether, pervading everything and everybody.' '
Mrs. Morris's subject had died 32 years earlier, but her 600-page biography benefited enormously from interviews, notably with Edith's 85-year-old son, Archibald Bulloch Roosevelt, who responded to a request for information Mrs. Morris had placed in the New York Times Book Review.
A close relationship Mrs. Morris forged with his son Archie Jr. launched her on a biography of Luce, who rose from a tumultuous childhood in Spanish Harlem to become a Vanity Fair editor, congresswoman, diplomat and playwright, as well as the wife of Time magazine co-founder Henry Luce.
Mrs. Morris met Luce at a Roosevelt family dinner party. 'She appeared to pay no attention to me,' Mrs. Morris wrote in a New York Times essay, but the 77-year-old Luce later remarked: 'You're too young and charming to be a writer.' Nonetheless, the two began a courtship through the mail, with Mrs. Morris sending a copy of her last book and writing, 'Someone will embark on a major biography, and I should like it to be me.'
The biography ultimately spanned 1,300 pages and two volumes, 'Rage for Fame: The Ascent of Clare Boothe Luce' (1997) and 'Price of Fame: The Honorable Clare Boothe Luce' (2014). Beginning her research in 1981, Mrs. Morris devoted 33 years to the project, working her way through 246 linear feet and 460,000 items of archival material at the Library of Congress " a collection, she said, that was 'bigger than that of most Presidents.'
'Like her husband, she was an indefatigable researcher, and wanted to leave no stone unturned,' said Will Murphy, who edited her second Luce volume for Random House. 'Sylvia was trying to absorb into the life of Clare Boothe Luce her times, and the history that unfolded around her and that she helped shape.'
Luce had " at 20 " married a millionaire who was more than twice her age, then divorced him and landed a job at Vanity Fair after simply showing up at the office, sitting down at an empty desk and waiting for assignments. She went on to write the hit 1936 Broadway play 'The Women,' which became a popular film, and struck Henry Luce like a bolt of lightning.
According to Mrs. Morris, he left his wife and two sons after seeing Clare for the second time; later, Luce served two terms in the U.S. House of Representatives and was appointed Eisenhower's ambassador to Italy and Brazil. 'I hope I shall have ambition until the day I die,' she told Mrs. Morris, in one of their many interviews before Luce's death in 1987.
Both volumes of Mrs. Morris's biography were met with general acclaim, with Gore Vidal calling 'Rage for Fame' " the title came from a quote by English satirist John Wolcot, which Luce used for her eighth-grade yearbook " 'a model biography . . . of the sort that only real writers can write.'
The books also angered some reviewers, and friends of Luce's, who accused Mrs. Morris of being too critical in her examination of a woman described as an inveterate embellisher of stories, and sometimes as an outright liar. (She also had a playful, adventurous side, Mrs. Morris reported, which included scuba diving and LSD use.)
'These characters take over your life, these huge characters,' Mrs. Morris told Newsday in 2001. 'I find that you neglect your personal life, your family life.' But it took time, she said, to uncover details such as the color of Edith Roosevelt's eyes (sapphire blue) or the humorous names Clare Luce gave to her ulcers (Qaddafi and Begin).
'The longer you take,' she added, 'the better understanding you have.'
Sylvia Jukes was born in Dudley, a suburb of Birmingham, on May 24, 1935. Her mother was a homemaker, and her father ran a munitions factory. Mrs. Morris 'was very misunderstood in the area we were brought up in,' said her sister, Pennington. 'She was a very quiet little girl, basically, and I think people found that a little intimidating.'
Mrs. Morris was 9 when her mother died. She won a scholarship to a girl's high school and drew early praise as a writer for her senior thesis, which was read by historian A.J.P. Taylor, according to Pennington, and traced the 19th-century deaths of local children to issues with the town's sewage system. She later studied at the University of London but left before receiving a degree, her sister said.
Mrs. Morris was teaching English at a London high school, living at a nearby boardinghouse, when she met Edmund. Raised in South Africa, he was an advertising copywriter and devoted pianist, and developed an informal arrangement with Mrs. Morris's landlord, performing chores in exchange for practice time on the building's piano.
They married in 1966, after she spotted him washing the floor, and soon immigrated to the United States. His Roosevelt project grew into a trilogy " almost twice the length of her Luce books " and both worked closely together. She read him each page of her manuscripts, including a passage on Theodore Roosevelt's death that had moved her to tears and left stains on her handwritten draft.
'They felt things so deeply,' said Marion Elizabeth Rodgers, an H.L. Mencken biographer who worked as a researcher for both Morrises in the late 1980s. 'To write these books, it was gut-wrenching. It took a lot out of them, physically and emotionally. . . . Edmund always said you have to be something of a masochist to be a biographer, and I think that's how she felt, too. But once she started writing, she could get on a tear: She'd begin in the morning, and wouldn't even get up to have lunch.'
In a C-SPAN interview, Edmund Morris recalled that he was once asked by a Times reporter whether it was easier to write about the living or the dead. 'I hadn't thought of it, and I was struggling to think what to say, when my wife, who was in the next room, shouted out, 'Dead is easier.' And of course this journalist used that line to begin his article in the New York Times the following day.'
Mrs. Morris, he added, 'got a T-shirt a couple of days later, which has 'Dead Is Easier' all over the front and which she wears when she gives lectures.'

Texto completo: When 'Ugly Betty' premiered in 2006, it was unlike anything that had previously been seen on American television. The series, adapted from the Colombian telenovela 'Yo Soy Betty, La Fea,' revolved around a Mexican American native of Queens who lands an unlikely job at a fictional Vogue-esque magazine.
Played by 'Real Women Have Curves' breakout America Ferrera, Betty " who shows up for her first day of work in a vibrant poncho emblazoned with 'Guadalajara' " was prone to being underestimated by her peers. The one-hour dramedy initially suffered the same fate. 'Ugly Betty,' which was created by Silvio Horta " who died Tuesday at age 45 in his native Miami, according to multiple outlets " predated the telenovela-inspired 'Jane the Virgin' and Hollywood's heightened attention on on-screen representation.
Even as some media outlets proclaimed it 'promising' and 'groundbreaking,' many were uncertain about the show's future and how it would play to a 'mainstream' audience. 'It's too much to ask of this mostly guileless, slightly ungainly series that it be another 'Lost' or 'Desperate Housewives' for ABC this year, so maybe we should watch aloofly, starting tonight,' the New York Times advised in its review of the show's first season. 'Let's let Betty find her locker and her lunch table, and observe her without asking that she be more than she is.'
But 'Ugly Betty' quickly gained a devoted fan base, thanks to its plucky heroine, a reliably hilarious ensemble cast " editrix Wilhelmina Slater (Vanessa Williams) and sassy fashion assistants Marc St. James (Michael Urie) and Amanda Tanen (Becki Newton) among them " and a healthy dose of sharp wit. About halfway through Season 1, the ABC comedy would prove just how much Betty Suarez resonated with viewers. In January 2007, 'Ugly Betty' won the Golden Globe for best TV comedy, beating out 'Entourage,' 'Weeds,' 'The Office' and, ahem , 'Desperate Housewives.'
'Like a lot of its characters and a lot of us up here right now, this show is an immigrant,' the show's creator, Silvio Horta, said as he accepted the honor with the cast and crew " including Ferrera and executive producer Salma Hayek " smiling behind him. 'Betty is a testament to the American Dream, and the American Dream is, in fact, alive and well " and within reach of anyone in the world who wants it.'
As a first-generation Cuban American, Horta was deeply familiar with that dream. It was an experience he infused into the beloved series, which ran for four seasons before its 2010 finale. 'Betty is first-generation Latino American, like myself, trying to straddle two new worlds,' Horta told TV Week ahead of the show's premiere.
Ferrera won best actress in a TV series musical or comedy at the 2007 Golden Globes, where she proclaimed 'it's such an honor to play a role that I hear from young girls on a daily basis how it makes them feel worthy and lovable and that they have more to offer the world than they thought.'
She paid tribute to Horta in an Instagram post Tuesday night: 'His talent and creativity brought me and so many others such joy - light. I'm thinking of his family and loved ones who must be in so much pain right now- and of the whole Ugly Betty family who feel this loss so deeply.'
'Ugly Betty' had been in development for years before ABC signed on to air it. According to a 2006 New York Times article, 'Betty La Fea' and a slew of successful international remakes had piqued the interest of Ben Silverman, the prolific producer behind 'The Office.' But the American version got a boost from Hayek, who recruited Ferrera with the promise of a role that the actress later described as 'lightning through my body.'
Horta " who penned the 1998 slasher film 'Urban Legend,' and helmed the short-lived UPN sci-fi series 'Jake 2.0' " was uniquely suited to adapt the popular telenovela for a U.S. audience. 'We had one television growing up, and my mom would be watching the telenovelas every night,' Horta told the Times. 'We had no choice. All my friends, first-generation immigrants, would make fun of them, and then become completely addicted.' The Miami-Dade County medical examiner ruled on Wednesday that the death was a suicide, according to NBC Miami.
Horta wanted to be involved with 'Ugly Betty' so much that he initially pitched a supremely over-the-top version that featured Betty as an FBI agent, he recalled in a 2007 Paley Center interview. But he soon found that his own experience was all he needed to draw on to make the show a success. 'I really just looked into my past, how I grew up with telenovelas and growing up being first-generation Cuban American and . . . that's the way I found in.'
'Through his friendships, his love and his work in TV and films, Silvio touched the lives of millions,' Horta's family said in a statement to Variety. The statement, attributed to Horta's mother and sister, described him as 'a kind and beautiful man' who 'had an ongoing struggle with addiction and depression.'
Horta was also remembered by other members of the close-knit 'Ugly Betty' cast. 'His creativity and passion will be missed by so many of us that worked with him,' Williams wrote on Instagram.
'I will be forever indebted to this sweet, brilliant man,' tweeted Urie, who also shared tributes from fans of the show. 'This is sad especially because Ugly Betty kinda shaped me into the person I am today,' one wrote. Another fan tweeted that Horta had changed his life: 'He is a shining example of what representation can do for a young, Latino brown gay boy.'
Justin, Betty's fashion-obsessed nephew, was partly inspired by Horta's own life. The character, a preteen in the show's pilot, eventually came out as gay. Horta recalled in a 2016 interview with the cast how he and the writers delicately approached the character's coming-out journey. That, too, was rooted in Horta's own experience.
'Silvio gave me my start at 11 years old and trusted me with a character that was so close to his heart,' Mark Indelicato, who played Justin, wrote in an Instagram story. 'He will be greatly missed by all.'

Texto completo: Larry Heinemann, a Vietnam veteran who explored his lingering battlefield memories in two acclaimed novels, including 'Paco's Story,' which unexpectedly won the National Book Award in 1987, died Dec. 11 at a hospital in Bryan, Tex. He was 75.
The cause was chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, said his daughter, Sarah Heinemann.
Drafted into the Army in 1966, Mr. Heinemann was sent to Vietnam, where he saw combat while peering over the barrel of a .50-caliber machine gun. After a tour of duty with the 25th Infantry Division, he returned to his hometown of Chicago and studied writing, compelled to tell the world about what he had experienced.
'I was a soldier of the most ordinary kind and the war took much away from me,' he wrote in a 2005 foreword to a new edition of 'Paco's Story,' 'but the war also gave me a story that simply would not be denied, as well as a way of looking at the world.'
At a time when other books about Vietnam, including Philip Caputo's 'A Rumor of War' and Tim O'Brien's 'Going After Cacciato,' were gaining wide recognition, Mr. Heinemann's first novel, 'Close Quarters' (1977), received little notice.
Described as 'a first-person grunt's-eye view of the Vietnam War' by novelist Ivan Gold in the New York Times, 'Close Quarters' recounted a year in the life of an infantry unit, with all its drudgery, violence, brutality " and ever-present fear.
'It rains harder for a time, then slacks,' he wrote. 'The moonlight dims and the rain picks up again. Then the not-quite-rain sound. Not the rustling of crickets and hares, not a night sound, but the stride of farmers, ploddish some, quick and silent some. Bare feet squeak in the grass. A silver and black shadow stands upright in the rain. . . . He fires.'
'Close Quarters' gained a certain gritty renown, literary scholar Gerald Nicosia wrote in 2005, and 'was quickly discovered and treasured by a loyal coterie of combat vets for its graphic, down-and-dirty realism.'
In 1986, Mr. Heinemann published 'Paco's Story,' the pained saga of a badly wounded soldier, Paco Sullivan, returning from Vietnam as the sole survivor of an attack that killed everyone else in his unit. The novel follows Paco as he wanders the country, getting off a bus in Texas, where he works as a dishwasher, with his thoughts invariably returning to the horrors he witnessed in Vietnam.
The story, related by one of Paco's ghostly fallen comrades, is addressed to an imaginary character referred to as James, whose only role is to listen in silence to the harrowing tale. The language is rough-hewn, profane and digressive, reflecting an attitude of cynicism and contempt toward authority of every kind. In one of his more lyrical passages, Mr. Heinemann wrote:
'And the next morning, in the bright, hot light of day, with the monsoon clouds clearing away to the west, the medic rose, stretched, and yawned . . . and he looked around, sour-faced, at the carnage and the ruin, the wreckage, at his fellows in Bravo Company (Which one of them will die today?). And, James, it was as if he saw the sheer, manifest ugliness " the blunt and pervasive, raw and stupefying ugliness " of that place for the first time.'
'Paco's Story' was one of five finalists for the National Book Award for fiction, including Toni Morrison's 'Beloved' and Philip Roth's 'The Counterlife.' When Mr. Heinemann was announced as the winner, there was an awkward moment of stunned silence.
'This is an interesting surprise,' Mr. Heinemann said in accepting the award, which included a $10,000 check and a sculpture by Louise Nevelson. 'I didn't come here expecting to win.'
Several days later, New York Times critic Michiko Kakutani published a tartly worded essay, noting the 'surprise and astonishment' of 'the literary community' and suggesting that 'Paco's Story' was not in the same league as 'Beloved.' A group of African American writers published a letter of protest in the Times, upset that Morrison had been overlooked. (Her novel was awarded the Pulitzer Prize several months later.)
'They can squawk all they want to,' Mr. Heinemann said. 'I ain't giving back the Nevelson and the $10,000 check has been cashed.'
Larry Curtis Heinemann was born Jan. 18, 1944, in Chicago. His father was a bus driver, his mother a homemaker.
Mr. Heinemann studied at a community college before serving in the Army. After coming back from Vietnam, he attended Columbia College Chicago, supporting himself as a bus driver before graduating in 1971.
'I became a writer because of the war,' he later said. 'If not for Vietnam, I'd be driving a bus.'
Two of Mr. Heinemann's brothers also served in the military during the Vietnam War. One of them vanished after returning from combat, and the other died by suicide.
'Everybody who came back knew that the war was a lie and that we had been betrayed and lied to,' Mr. Heinemann told the Los Angeles Times in 1988. 'Basically we were used, wasted and dumped.'
He taught for 15 years at his alma mater, Columbia College Chicago, and in 1992 published a comic novel, 'Cooler by the Lake,' that received lukewarm reviews. He received fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts and the Guggenheim Foundation and studied Vietnamese folklore on a Fulbright fellowship in Hue, Vietnam.
Mr. Heinemann was a writer-in-residence at several colleges, including at Texas A-M University from 2005 until his retirement in 2015.
His 45-year marriage to the former Edie Smith ended in divorce. Survivors include his partner of several years, Kathy Favor of Bryan; two children from his marriage, Sarah Heinemann of Brooklyn and Preston Heinemann of Chicago; and a granddaughter.
In 2005, Mr. Heinemann published a memoir, 'Black Virgin Mountain,' about his experiences in Vietnam and their lasting effect on his life.
'I arrived in Vietnam scared to death, and we were not pleasant people (down where the rubber met the road, so to speak) and the war was not a pleasant business,' he wrote. 'I have no doubt we radicalized more southern Vietnamese to Ho Chi Minh's nationalist revolution than we 'saved.' We understood perfectly well that we were the unwilling doing the unnecessary for the ungrateful.
'Like everyone else, I simply wanted out.'

Iran’s retaliation is more conventional than expected

Texto completo: After a U.S. drone strike killed Iranian General Qassem Soleimani last week, America braced itself for the unexpected: The Department of Homeland Security issued an advisory warning that Iran may launch cyberattacks against critical infrastructure. New York’s governor deployed the National Guard to New York City’s major airports.
Those precautions are wise and understandable. But Iran’s missile attacks on bases hosting U.S. troops in Iraq on Wednesday shows that the regime’s retaliation may be more conventional than expected.
Since the 1979 Islamic revolution, Iran has used terrorist groups as proxies to strike at civilians and embassies, attempting to obscure their own responsibility for these attacks. Now the Iranian regime is signaling a new approach. Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, told his advisers last week that its response should be a “direct and proportional attack on American interests,” according to the New York Times, and that it should be “openly carried out by Iranian forces themselves.”
That said, there is good reason to doubt that Iran’s response will be limited to this attack. Iran has fought its wars through proxies since the 1990s. This was Soleimani’s legacy. From 2003 until his death last week, he built up militias in Iraq, Yemen and Syria, waging an imperial war in the shadows on Iran’s behalf throughout the Middle East.
Some analysts acknowledge that Iran’s military has the capability to do a lot of damage, particularly to U.S. allies such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. But it “is not going to be able to out-escalate the United States,” says Alireza Nader, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. Khamenei understands this, he says, and he may be attempting to convey strength at a moment when the regime has been weakened.
Another possibility is that the U.S. drone strike demolished the strategy of plausible deniability that Iran has relied on for so long. It’s not just that Iran’s generals could no longer count on being spared the fate of the terrorists they cultivated and sponsored. The strike signaled a new U.S. strategy that imposes grave costs for Iran’s broader proxy war.
The regime will almost certainly still depend on its terrorist proxies. But Iran’s missile strike shows that it is prepared to engage in direct military attacks to take revenge for Soleimani. The world’s leading state sponsor of terrorism will also rely on conventional warfare.

Texto completo: Headnote LOCAL
ASK PHYLLIS ZEMBLE, the new Eastern Pennsylvania director of the national Jews Choose Trump organization, why she supports President Donald Trump, and she'll rattle off a litany of offenses by former President Barack Obama and the Democratic Party.
The mother of five and grandmother of 13, who is one of just 10 JCT regional directors, cites the Iran deal first and foremost,- but has plenty of other gripes with the Democrats.
"Gradually, the traditional values of family, education and hard work were being replaced with single-parent homes, anti-Semitism on college campuses, an increase in city crime and a lower threshold for government welfare," Zemble said of the Obama presidency. She also noted that one of Obama's first phone calls to another head of state after his inauguration was to Mahmoud Abbas.
"You know where (Obama's) allegiance lies, and it was not with Israel," she said.
Zemble switched parties to vote for Trump in the 2016 presidential election, and will help lead an effort to convince Eastern Pennsylvania voters - Jews and non-Jews alike - to vote Republican this fall.
"By putting my name out there, and showing that I support Donald Trump, maybe I'll influence a few people to not be afraid to admit their support for Donald Trump," Zemble said.
She's aware that he remains largely unpopular with Jewish voters but she's thankful for the president's Israel policy, and appreciates his demeanor as well.
The president "speaks with what he's thinking at the moment. He's not a trained politician, with advisers in his ear. He says what he feels at the time, and I respect that," Zemble said.

Zemble, who once served as a Lower Merion Township commissioner, was approached about taking the position by Lori Lowenthal Marcus, a well-known local Israel activist who has been vocal about her support for Trump. Marcus helped found JCT with Carol Greenwald and Richard Allen in July 2016. The three of them now make up the executive committee. As Greenwald notes, the organization is not a PAC, nor a 501(c)(3), and does not accept donations of any sort; it is, as she puts it, "nothing but free speech."
Indeed, the JCT website, in addition to making the case for Trump's benefit to American Jews and Israel, largely consists of blog posts by Greenwald or op-eds from jns.org, in addition to photos of Zemble and other JCT members wearing JCT apparel while posing with right-wing media figures.
Greenwald, like Zemble, was a registered Democrat for many years. The former Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks was known as a crusading reformer - The New York Times called her a "maverick bank official" in a 1981 headline. She even wrote a book with an introduction by Ralph Nader ("Banks Are Dangerous to Your Wealth"). But she's always been deeply committed to Israel and, after 9/11, her politics took a turn. Now, she's committed to the reelection of Trump, who she believes will win.
"It is our opinion that the record cannot be left to stand that there was no part of the Jewish community that was not enthusiastic and grateful for everything this president has done for the Jews," Greenwald said. She worries that if the Jewish community does not show gratitude to the president, he'll adopt the attitude of former Republican official James Baker, who served under presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush: "F- 'em, they don't vote for me anyway."
"History will treat the Jewish leadership very harshly for their allegiance to a Democratic Party that has abandoned them," she said.
Zemble's position with JCT will consist of lobbying local organizations to have her or someone from the board speak to their members about the accomplishments of the Trump administration. For Zemble, it's a chance to be involved in something she believes in.
"If you see something that's wrong, you have to correct it," she said. *

Yes, we need another Rachmaninoff recording

Texto completo: DESTINATION: RACHMANINOV -– ARRIVAL

Daniil Trifonov with the Philadelphia Orchestra (Deutsche Grammophon)

The standard repertory in classical music is often standard for good reason: Great works are gifts that keep on giving with repeated hearings.

But what about repeated recordings? It's one thing to hear young pianists take on Rachmaninoff's mighty Third Piano Concerto in concert, with its in-the-moment excitement. But do they really need to record it?

After all, the market is saturated with several dozen recordings.

This overload did not stop young Russian pianist Daniil Trifonov from newly recording the piece with the Philadelphia Orchestra and Yannick NÃ©zet-SÃ©guin. That release, on Deutsche Grammophon, completes Trifonov's two-album survey of the four Rachmaninoff concertos.

And it's splendid. His white-hot virtuosity is tempered by coolheaded thinking and lyrical sensitivity. Passages of teeming intensity are rendered with wondrous clarity and lightness. Yet, when appropriate, Trifonov shapes phrases and colors chords with milky richness. The third movement is crackling delight.

The recording offers proof that new takes on standard repertory works - if not as essential as recordings of works by living composers or of overlooked scores from the past - can enrich and enliven the art form. It's empowering for performers and audiences alike to have recordings of these scores by artists we can hear today. In the flush of hearing Trifonov, you may well think: Who needs Horowitz?

BORN IN THE BRONX

Handsome Dick Manitoba (Liberation Hall)

The front man of punk progenitors the Dictators steps up with his first solo album, and, go figure, the brash singer who wears his New York-ness like a badge of honor cut Born in the Bronx in Nashville, with producer/multi-instrumentalist Jon Tiven and a bunch of Americana stalwarts.

But no, Handsome Dick Manitoba is not trying to reinvent himself as a rootsy troubadour. The music is mostly fast and rocking, spiced by sax and piano, echoing the spirit of early rock-and-roll, and fitting right into Manitoba's wheelhouse. His first set of self-penned (with Tiven) songs is Big Apple-centric.

Manitoba is not the smoothest of vocalists and lyricists, but with him, feeling and attitude have always trumped finesse. The same holds true here, whether he's recalling a teen romance ("Callie") and his wayward youth in a housing project ("Magenta Street"), longing for an idealized California ("Surfside), or, on the darker side, dealing with addiction ("The Cooker and the Hit"). He also delivers a couple of solid slices of pop-soul with "Thicker Than Blood" and "8th Avenue Serenade."

The one non-original, a timely take on P.F. Sloan's "Eve of Destruction," finds Manitoba at his most earnest. But have no fear, his old strutting boastfulness and "white boy jive" is on full display in "Soul Punk King of NYC."

ICE CREAM IN HELL

Tinsley Ellis (Alligator Records)

Atlanta-born, Florida-raised blues rocker Tinsley Ellis has performed at various times in Toledo over the years, from being a foot-stompin' summer festival headliner at International Park to bringing down the house with a fiery show at a West Toledo blues club. Ellis, considered one of the hardest working musicians on the blues-rock scene today, jokingly said he has traveled enough miles over the past 40 years of touring "to get to the moon and back six times."

This album, the 18th solo recording in his long and illustrious career, is what Ellis himself considers one of the most guitar-driven performances of his career. While I'm not sure if that's true (only because all Ellis albums leave nothing behind, guitar-wise), Ice Cream in Hell certainly has its searing moments.

It's old school. And it has the sheer power and rawness that puts Ellis in a class of his own. His soulful ballads and wailing guitar solos are - as always - something to behold. The 11-song disc showcases the influence of the Three Kings on him (Freddie, B.B., and Albert King), as well as that of Carlos Santana, Hound Dog Taylor, and others.

Ellis has performed in the past with the likes of Stevie Ray Vaughan, Otish Rush, Willie Dixon, Leon Russell, Albert Collins, and KoKo Taylor. Ice Cream in Hell is rugged, gritty, grisled, and another fine example of his Southern blues-rock style.

Texto completo: "I'm always going to be a failure to somebody, a starlet to somebody, overrated to somebody. I don't care about any of that, I just want to tell the truth and do it in style."
At age 18, Bianca Vivion Brooks became the youngest contracted opinion writer for The New York Times. Three years later she became the youngest New York Times writer ever to be published in print. Growing up between Atlanta and Oakland, and living in Harlem throughout college and early adulthood, Brooks has lived within some of America's most cherished, yet forgotten, communities. And through this lived magnifying lens, Brooks has been able to produce some of the most compelling and profound commentary on the 21st century. With nearly a decade of writing experience under her belt, including a degree in human rights and economics from Columbia University, but a lifetime of practicing love and celebrating Blackness, she's never lost sight of her audience.
"The people I'm beholden to are the people I grew up with. I always say, 'God and the Ghetto, send me back to both when I'm done with all of this.' I'm not thinking-when I'm writing- about white liberals in America. I'm writing to the person I needed to hear from when I was 15,16, 21, 22. That's who I'm always writing for."
In a time where the young, Black voice has been silenced, exploited and tokenized by white publications and audiences, Brooks has been intentional about positioning these voices, including her own, and their experiences at the core of her writing. It is this genuine love for her communities-Black folks young people, artists, the South- that allows her to rise each morning and continue telling the truth.
"Loving others is the only reason for life. Love God and cherish people. That's the only reason I want to be alive, anything else is jus: commentary. I'll do it with a movie with a book, I don't care what I'm doing on a day-to-day basis as long as it's real and fun."
And when it comes to success, love is still at the root of all of her hare work and the driving force behino her livelihood as a Black woman. Without which Brooks says she would feel incomplete-a lesson that she's learned from other successful Black women, such as the late Toni Morrison, a major inspiration for the writer.
"If you make love a secondary or tertiary priority, you're going to feel like a failure.. .fust really pursue love. I think Black women especially, it's one of the things that make me emotional, that by the time we reach the pinnacle of success the one thing that we decided we could sacrifice is love."
In 2020, the self-proclaimed entertainer, artist and lover is set to release "Generational Anxiety," a laik show, along with a collection of essays entitled 'Swimming Backwards: Stories of a girl who reac the fine print."
Brooks currently lives in Harlem, New York and can be reached at bianca@vivionco.com.

Texto completo: This past holiday season, ballet history was made when New York City Ballets annual production of George Balanchines jį "The Nutcracker" featured 11-year-old Charlotte Nebres, lbe Inst Black ballerina cast as the classics lead since it was first produced sixty-five years ago, in 1954.
Nebres played the ballet's central Figure. Marie, a little girl whose Christmas is brightened by the gift of a toy Nutcracker. The ballet is filled with the stuff of children's fairy tales. There is a dream sequence with a towering Christmas tree a battle between giant mice and toy soldiers led by the Nutcracker, an enchanted snow-covered forest, dancing snowflakes, a Land of Sweets with a Sugar Plum fairy and waltzing flowers. In the ballet, Nebres holds the Lincoln Center stage with ease and grace.
While much of the media coverage of Nebres focuses on the fact a Black youngster "breaks the color barrier" and stars in this time-honored ballet classic, Charlotte captured its importance when telling a New York Times reporter how she felt watching Misty Copeland become the first Black ballerina American Ballet Theatre chose to make a principal after 75 years: "I saw her perform and she was just so inspiring and so beautiful. When I saw someone who looked like me onstage, I thought, that's amazing. She was representing me and all the people like me." Nebres probably spoke for many aspiring Brown-skinned ballerinas when she added, "I feel free and I feel empowered. I feel like I can do anything when I dance. It makes me happy..." But, she also reminded us of the many little girls and boys before her who, though equally talented and capable, had been locked out of that world simply because of the color of their skin.
Let's face it, until recently, for many Black parents the predominantly white world of ballet didn't make their child's dream of becoming a ballet dancer a realistic career choice. So, to get Nebres' parents perspective on the fact NYCB finally chose to permit a lovely, young, gifted and Black ballerina to play the lead in its production ofThe "Nutcracker," The Amsterdam News recently spoke to Charlotte Nebres' mother, who, herself, studied ballet at a young age.
Q: Charlotte has such a lovely stage presence. How long has she been dancing?
Ms. Nebres: Charlotte started dancing while she was in my stomach. I would take her to the Mommy and Me ballet class I attended with her older daughter before and after she was bom. Then, when she was 6 years old, she started with the Children's Division of the School of American Ballet, the feeder school for NYCB. Some of tire kids are asked to participate in productions, like The Nutcracker, beginning around age 8. At age 9, Charlotte appeared in the ballet as an angel. The following Christmas she was one of the little cousins at the party. This year, she's Marie, who the story centers around. She's also been in Midsummer Night's Dream and had a leading role in Sleeping Beauty where she was Little Red Riding Mood. She was pretty magnificent in that and that was my first inkling she might be in the running for some sort of lead role. I didn't realize before that she could hold the stage in that way, but it was really delightful and mesmerizing to watch.
Q: 1 las NYCB talked about a career trajectory for Charlotte?
A: We really haven't. She's in the Children's Division now. It's an honor to be part of that. Her sister is in her first year in the Intennediate Division at SAB, so we've sort of had those discussions, very cautiously for her. But, for Charlotte it's a little early.
Q: It's wonderful that you, as her parents, are so supportive of your children's dance aspirations.
A: We think it's great for their development and there is so much to learn from tliis sort of study. The discipline they get from dance is tremendous. Crowing up in dance I had some experience and got to know how brilliant and disciplined dancers are.
Q: But there is also the question of it being a viable career.
A: Of course, there is the need to have a tangible career patlı or academic track for our children. Both my husband and I are first generation Americans. Ocuparen ts were immigrants to tliis country, mine from the Caribbean (Trinidad) and his from Asia (Philippines), so that comes with a certain amount of expectation that my husband and I dealt with growing up. My husband's mother and father are both physicians and my father was a medical doctor, so they had ambitions for us in that way, so botlı of us ended up going to college and grad school. But we also understand that, in this country, there are many paths to success and as parents, we're trying to have a balanced approach to what our kids seek for their future and how we can assist them.
Q: I low :s Charlotte handling this newfound attention?
A: The best part of it is how this whole Nutcracker run has been structured: there is no downtime. Also, social media hasn't come into their lives in a big way. There are no accounts on Instagram or those other outlets. We've also focused on casual family-oriented down time with her sister and little brother -crafting, watching a few TV shows, doing musical theatre, sing-a-long type tilings. She's been pretty insulated, in fact, I don't think she understands what's happening. I don't either, really, (chuckling)
Q: I understand she recently got a chance tc meet Misty Copeland and that made a strong impression on her.
A: Misty was so wonderful. Obviously, she's been where Charlotte is as a young perfonner, so she very thoughtfully asked that no one mention to Charlotte ahead of time tli a: she was going to be in the audience. After the Matinee the NYCB folks told her, 'There's a special guest who wants to meet you.' Then they asked, 'Would you like to meet Misty Copeland?' Charlotte burst into a radiant smile and said, 'Of course. There was a crowd of beautiful people of color standing on stage clapping and there was Misty with her amis outsfretched reaching out to Charlotte, and then that wann hug. It was very sweet and so surreal. Charlotte was overwhelmed with excitement and love. It was so special She was very giddy and happy.
Q: Now, like Misty, Charlotte is part of a unique moment in the history of Blacks in ballet in America. Do you talk to her about that?
A: I think there's a sort of innocence that Charlotte still has but she is aware and it has come up at the ballet school. The SAB Alumnae Advisory Panel on Diversity has brought in graduates who've shared their experiences and I've made sure Charlotte and her sister go. She got to meet Aisha Ash (the beautiful Black ballerina whose picture was featured with the New York Times article "Where Are All The Black Swans?") Ash talked very frankly about her experience as a student and NYCB company member and about the pain she experienced, and, obviously, as a family of color we've discussed race and how it plays into our daily lives.
They've also seen the women of color currently in NYCB, like the gorgeous dancer India Bradley and Rachel Hutsell. They see how glorious they are on stage, but they have also started to notice who's in the company, who's a soloist, who's a principle. So, now they say 'Well, we think they're fabulous, but is the company going to promote them?' I'm hoping that, as young girls, they're not disappointed. I hope Charlotte and her sister get the correct message from watching some of these young rising ballerinas and see that progress can happen the way it happened with Misty. I have my fingers crossed that we'll have some good news about some of those young ladies that will affirm for my daughters that, 'Oh, yes, there's space for me.'
Q: What advice would you give to other Black parents of daughters and sons who aspire to careers in ballet?
A: I would say it's really important to know as a parent that while we have ideas for our children and we want to mold and shape them, that we can also learn from them. Also, when one child has a unique opportunity, it's important for the whole family to participate because the others can also learn and potentially leam from that, too.
Q: And, when it's a history-making event that potentially plays a pivotal role opening doors for others?
A: I'm so honored NYCB chose Charlotte. Of course, there have been öftrer children before who were ready to handle this experience but, my daughter has been lucky. She's so happy about it and now, thanks to this moment, öftrer children waiting in the wings can hope.

Texto completo: So let me get this straight: We have an impeached president authorizing international assassinations at an international airport, heedless of possible civilian casualties, without consulting with relevant congressional leaders, while tweeting from a golf course.
His justification for assassinating Iranian Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, a top Iranian Revolutionary Guard commander, has been judged suspicious by informed Pentagon analysts and by folks with common sense all around the world.
According to New York Times correspondent Rukmini Callimachi, "I've had a chance to check in with sources, including two U.S. officials who had intelligence briefings after the strike on Suleimani. Here is what I've learned. According to them, the evidence suggesting there was to be an imminent attack on American targets is 'razor thin.'"
Given his track record as a compulsive liar-15,000 lies counted by The
Washington Post since he's been in office - it's hard to give him the benefit of the doubt... because he lies!
There was a time in 2011 when Trump repeatedly tweeted diat then-President Barack Obama would bomb Iran in order to get reelected. Oh, how the worm has turned.
That's what failing presidents do, in order to deflect public attention away from their problems and onto a national security threat. In fact, on the day of former White House intern Monica Lew-inskys testimony in his impeachment trial, President Bill Clinton bombed a Sudanese pharmaceutical plant, falsely claiming there were "precursors" to weapons of mass destruction (WMD) in the soil outside the plant.
Then he did it again: on the day before the Senate vote on his impeachment -Dec 16,1998-Clinton played the oldest game in the book, bombing Iraq, citing a "military need to move swifdy" according to The Times. The tactic delayed the impeachment vote.
But what may really be behind this dangerous gambit is 45's loyalty to the State of Israel, even above U.S. interests. When asked why he was so soft on Saudi Arabia after the brutal murder and dismemberment of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khassogi in one of the country's embassies, he said Saudi Arabia has been a "great ally," adding that, "without them, Israel would be in a lot more trouble."
There are credible news media reports that Israel even had advance notice of the U.S. plan, even when congressional leaders in this country were kept in the dark. This is according to Israeli military and diplomatic analysts who refrained from providing details due to heavy military censorship.
"Our assessment is that the United States informed Israel about this operation in Iraq, apparendy a few days ago," said Barak Ravid, a journalist and commentator with deep sources in the Israeli security establishment, according to Mondoweiss.
The U.S. signed on to the Israeli strategy even before Trump, though. Former Supreme Allied Commander Wesley Clark said a handful of Arab-Muslim countries were to be dealt with by U.S. power. "We're going to take out seven countries in five years, starting with Iraq, and dien Syria, Lebanon, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and finishing off with Iran," Clark said on Dec 16, 2016 according to "Democracy Now!" Check the list.
Then, after snubbing his own government - yet informing Russian authorities, and even guests at his Mar-a-Lago golf resort where he spent the holidays - he told Congress to follow his Twitter feed in order to get the latest.
"These Media Posts will serve as notification to the United States Congress that should Iran strike any U.S. person or target, the United States will quickly & fully strike back, & perhaps in a disproportionate manner. Such legal notice is not required, but is given nevertheless!" The Dude tweeted from Air Force One on his return from Florida to Washington. That's what you call "cheeky."
What's more, this Guy's golf cart rentals alone have cost the taxpayers $500,000 for 257 days at a golf resort he owns. In all, he has spent 338 days at a property he owns (billing the government for his staff and his Secret Service detail), since he took office in 2017. He and his cadre claim the country can't afford medical care, food, or education for millions of its people, yet he's spent $5.6 trillion on war since 9/11, this according to Andrea Germanos, writing for Common Dreams. And he boasted this week that he's spent $2 trillion on fancy weapons that can destroy even sacred cultural sites in Iran, which would constitute a war crime. Wow!
Brace yourself This country will certainly be in for a rough ride in 2020 - apocalyptic or maybe Armageddon-style, even.

Apathy Remains as 100th Anniversary of Women's Suffrage Approaches

Texto completo: This is part of an ongoing Washington Informer series about the Women's Suffrage Movement and an initiative that includes Informer Publisher Denise Rolark Barnes that will use the lens of history, the fabric of art and culture and the venue of the public square to shine a light into dark places, equipping all with a compass to chart the way forward. The initiative lives in the institutional home of the Washington Informer Charities.
The suffrage movement undoubtedly left many scars, and today African American women still look back with apathy because of the way their heroic ancestors, who fought for the rights of everyone, were mistreated.
Monique Lewis, founder of the PR consultancy firm ML Management, said the suffragist movement is why she doesn't identify as a feminist.
'As a Black woman of this current century, I certainly did not grow up without hearing stories of misogyny, discrimination and racism, particularly the intersection of all three when it came to Black women," Lewis said. "I understood from a young age what the feminist movements did - equality, voting rights, equal pay, and more. What was hidden from me, quite intentionally, were the stories of women who looked like me who was leading or participating in these movements."
For Lewis, it would take decades of self-education to discover the contributions of Black women in the suffrage movement.
"We literally were the hidden figures, and, often, when white and non-Black women reached their success, they never reached back to pull us up along with them," Lewis said. "We were utilized and discarded. This is why I vehemently state that I am not a feminist, I am a womanist who stands for and with other Black women.
"Being the most maligned, degraded, and abused, I soon realized that we are forced to rely on each other as we lack support from other women," she said.
Lewis isn't alone. New York Times editorial board member Brent Staples wrote that among the suffrage movement's worst offenses, "it rendered nearly invisible the Black women who labored in the suffragist vineyard and that it looked away from the racism that tightened its grip on the fight for the women's vote in the years after the Civil War."
Sinead DeRoiste, of ERA Par-rish Realty Legacy Group, said that in today's economy, Black women continue to earn significantly less than their professional peers, including those of equal or less experience, education, or time committed to an organization.
"If Black women were ever intended to be treated as women and ladies in our society, why hasn't the toxic masculine popular culture of rap music been addressed for its grotesque misrepresentation of Black women as subjects to degrade either lyrically, visually, physically, or otherwise?" DeRoiste wondered.
"Look at the disproportionate amounts of Black women who are going missing at such alarming rates," DeRoiste said. "Yet, if Black women were beneficiaries of the women's empowerment, suffrage, and #MeToo movement, where are the public outrage and uniformed gatherings in honor of fellow women who are continuing to suffer due to inequity both financial, social, and otherwise?"
Film writer and producer Faith DeVeaux, who authored the book "When Duty Calls," said since she learned that the suffragettes didn't want to "deal with the color problem," she lost interest in anything to do with the celebration or remembrance of the 19 th Amendment that gave women the right to vote.
"Some white feminists that I know don't even notice that there are no Black women in any of the footage or photos documenting the movement," she said. "I don't recall seeing a significant amount of Black women in the 2016 Women's March in D.C. I've seen many articles floating around the internet lately about how Black women are the backbone of the Democratic party and are being taken for granted.
"I've just been in a conversation with someone talking about a local production on the suffrage movement," DeVeaux said. "The only Black woman included is Ida B. Wells."

Texto completo: Whenever an organization has nonprofit status, the public seems to assume that its objective is to benefit the people. For that reason, it is expected that political liberals would support trade unions, even without considerable assurance of the moral clarity of their expenditures. A recent New York Times report on the federal investigation of the United Automobile Workers union suggests that the public should not be so blindly forgiving.
Trade unions are supported by the dues paid by members. One expects that union officials would be economical with the union funds produced by the sweat of the workers' brows.
However, between August of 2014 and June of 2017, UAW officials spent more than $1 million of union funds for fancy meals and for the rental of villas in a Palm Springs, California resort. Union officials burned up UAW funds in the cost of expensive cigars.
Clearly, the vice of human greed is not restricted to corporate officials. The comfort of the well-financed lifestyle is generally attractive. Many people will sell their souls to be able to live in comfort. Armed with an awareness of this human flaw, the working class is forced to spend the time and energy to protect themselves from the unbridled avarice of others.

Accident or Attack, Iran 737 Crash Is Not What Boeing Needs Right Now

Texto completo: It’s still far too early to know exactly what caused a Ukrainian passenger jet to crash six minutes after takeoff from Tehran early Wednesday, killing all 176 people on board, but there are already consequences.
As The New York Times reported, airline crash investigations can take a year or more in the best of circumstances—and this is not that. The crash occurred during a state of near-war between the United States and Iran, as well as an extremely rough period for Boeing, manufacturer of the Ukraine International Airlines Boeing 737-800 (which, it must be emphasized early, is related to but is not the 737 Max, which is grounded and will require significant investment to fly again).
SEE ALSO: Boeing Backs Virgin Galactic’s Supersonic Jet Project in Space Travel Bid
In an absence of answers, for now, the disaster will be all things for all people: a regrettable and so-far inexplicable accident, or a clear sign of aggression—a theory flatly denied by Iranian officials (and who benefits from downing a passenger jet in these circumstances is far from clear). Either way, it’s more potential bad news for embattled Boeing, which won’t be able to participate directly in the investigation—now undertaken by experts, as well as amateur sleuths across the world “thanks” to social media.

I finally found the exact location of the #PS752 crash site.

CNN: US intelligence is “taking a look at the crash” of the Ukrainian jet last as suspicions rise about what could have caused a Boeing jet to crash near the Tehran airport shortly after takeoff.
— Shimon Prokupecz (@ShimonPro) January 8, 2020
Authorities in Iran, from where missiles were fired towards U.S. and Iraqi military targets in Iraq four hours prior, said “technical failure following a fire” brought down the plane in a field.
The possibility of some kind of technical malfunction seemed bolstered by a later analysis, supported by video evidence, that suggested the plane had turned back around toward the Tehran airport when it caught fire, continued to maintain altitude, and then, exploded, rather than hitting the ground intact.
For their part, Ukrainian officials backed away from an earlier statement attributing the disaster to engine failure, declaring all possibilities open—except for pilot error on the part of the highly experienced crew.
Two videos we verified of the crash – including this posted early on by an Iranian journalist – confirm #PS752 was ablaze, kept some altitude, before exploding and downing fast. Debris and remains spread over large area. @trbrtc geolocated a 2nd video. https://t.co/1XsjWjVkvq

Eighty-two the victims were Iranian citizens and 63 were Canadian citizens, according to The Financial Times , quoting Ukraine’s foreign minister. There are significant numbers of both Ukrainians and Iranians in Canada, the paper noted—which raises a salient question: If it was a missile, as questionable Twitter accounts are claiming, why would Iranian forces want to murder their own people? (What “false flag” attacks there are in reality generally aren’t self-inflicted wounds.)
Russia is an Iranian ally; it’s also very hard to conceive of a situation in which either the U.S. or Israel would have strategic interest in an attack, let alone be able to position weapons inside Iranian territory near an airport.
For these reasons, and statistics, some terrible accident would appear to be more likely, though solid answers will only be found in the wreckage—in both the “black boxes” recording flight data and cockpit chatter, as well in the remnants of the plane and the remains of the victims.
As much as 80% of fatal commercial airline disasters occur during either takeoff or landing—however, according to a Boeing analysis, 48% of all fatal crashes occurred during the final approach and landing. (At the same time, there’s some precedent in recent history for fatal or near-fatal takeoffs: American Airlines Flight 587 crashed in Rockaway, Queens, after takeoff from JFK, killing all on board; US Airways Flight 1549, the setting for the “Miracle on the Hudson,” managed to ditch in the Hudson River after it struck a flock of Canadian geese two minutes after takeoff from LaGuardia Airport.) Takeoff and initial climb, which comprise about 2% of flight time and are the stages in which something went wrong here, account for 14% of accidents.
For now, owing to tensions between the United States and Iran, neither Boeing nor American investigators will have access to the black boxes, though Ukrainian officials may participate, as per most recent media reports.
If the craft was brought down by a missile, evidence attesting to the fact will be very obvious and extremely hard to hide—so long as scrupulous investigators are granted access to the debris and to the victims.
The disaster drew comparisons to Malaysia Airlines flight MH17, a passenger jet shot down over eastern Ukraine in July 2014. Investigators believe a surface-to-air missile provided by Russian to pro-Russian separatists shot down the plane and murdered 298 passengers and crew—in no small part because investigators recovered both paint and shrapnel fragments from a missile in the wreckage, and also determined beyond doubt that only a missile could have created the explosion that brought down the plane in-flight, one of the least likely times for a crash. (Images circulating on Twitter, purporting to show tail sections of a common surface-to-air missile, are untrustworthy at best.)
Boeing, so far, has remained near-silent on the disaster, but at least some investors seem to be reacting.
Stock in Boeing was trading at $331.37 a share at markets’ close on Tuesday, before briefly tumbling to just above $300 a share in after-hours trading—roughly the same position where the stock had pitted in December 2018, when the company and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) first reported that the 737 Max’s steering system posed an “unacceptable safety risk.”
That’s a significant dip from its 2019 high of $440.62, a peak Boeing stock hit in March, after 737 Max craft were grounded, but Wednesday’s nadir still represents a significant long-term gain for Boeing investors who held the stock in 2016, when it was trading in the low $100s.
Markets are people, and people are not rational—and there will be many questionable actors using the crash to push various hobbyhorses.

Texto completo: (JTA) — Iran will no longer honor the nuclear deal it signed with world powers.
The announcement came Sunday following a meeting of the Islamic Republic’s National Security Council to discuss the country’s nuclear policy following the assassination on Friday of Qassem Soleimani by the United States, The New York Times reported. Soleimani was the head of the Iranian Quds Force, which operates a number of regional militias and is allied with terrorist groups targeting Israel, including Hezbollah and Hamas.
“The Islamic Republic of Iran will end its final limitations in the nuclear deal, meaning the limitation in the number of centrifuges. Therefore, Iran’s nuclear program will have no limitations in production including enrichment capacity and percentage and number of enriched uranium and research and expansion,” read a statement released after the Sunday meeting, the Times reported.
Since the Trump administration pulled out of the nuclear agreement, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action signed, and reimposed economic sanctions, Iran had begun to abrogate many parts of the deal, including exceeding the nuclear enrichment level set by the deal and operating advanced centrifuges.
China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, Germany and the European Union have remained committed to the pact.
The Iranian government said it would return to the nuclear deal if the sanctions against it were removed.

Texto completo: There are no more adults in the room.
After three harrowing years, we’ve reached the point many of us feared from the moment Donald Trump was elected. His decision to kill Maj. Gen. Qassem Soleimani, Iran’s second most important official, made at Mar-a-Lago with little discernible deliberation, has brought the United States to the brink of a devastating new conflict in the Middle East.
We don’t yet know how far Iran will go in its retaliation, or whether all-out war will be averted.
But already, NATO has suspended its mission training Iraqi forces to fight ISIS. Iraq’s Parliament has voted to expel U.S. troops — a longtime Iranian objective. On Sunday, Iran said it will no longer be bound by the remaining restrictions on its nuclear program in the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, the deal that Trump abandoned in 2018.
The administration has said that the killing of Soleimani was justified by an imminent threat to American lives, but there is no reason to believe this. One skeptical U.S. official told The New York Times that the new intelligence indicated nothing but “a normal Monday in the Middle East,” and Democrats briefed on it were unconvinced by the administration’s case.
The Washington Post reported that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo — who last year agreed with a Christian Broadcasting Network interviewer that God might have sent Trump to save Israel from the “Iranian menace” — has been pushing for a hit on Soleimani for months.
Rather than self-defense, the Soleimani killing seems like the dreadful result of several intersecting dynamics. There’s the influence of rapture-mad Iran hawks like Pompeo and Vice President Mike Pence. Defense officials who might have stood up to Trump have all left the administration.
According to Peter Bergen’s book “Trump and His Generals,” James Mattis, Trump’s former secretary of defense, instructed his subordinates not to provide the president with options for a military showdown with Iran.
But with Mattis gone, military officials, The Times reported, presented Trump with the possibility of killing Soleimani as the “most extreme” option on a menu of choices, and were “flabbergasted” when he picked it.
It’s hard to see how this ends without disaster. Defenders of Trump’s move have suggested that he might have reestablished deterrence against Iran, frightening its leadership into restraint. But Vali Nasr, a Middle East scholar at Johns Hopkins University and former senior adviser to Obama’s State Department, tells me that Iran likely believes that it has to reestablish deterrence against the United States.
“If they don’t do anything, or if they don’t do enough, then Trump will get comfortable with this kind of behavior, and that worries them,” Nasr said. To Iranians, after all, America is the aggressor, scrapping a nuclear agreement that they were abiding by.
“His maximum pressure policy has failed,” Nasr said of Trump. “He has only produced a more dangerous Iran.”
Unlike with North Korea, it’s difficult to imagine any photo op or exchange of love letters defusing the crisis the president has created.
Now the nightmare phase of the Trump presidency is here. The biggest surprise is that it took so long.

Why does Washington demonize drug companies?

Texto completo: Over the holidays, I read Elton John's biography, Me. He writes about his friendship with Freddie Mercury, the ultratalented lead singer of the rock group Queen. Mercury tragically died at the age of 45 of AIDS in 1991. Mercury was one of the last people to die of the disease in Britain during the epidemic years. John writes sadly and almost offhandedly that, if Mercury had lived one year longer, he probably would have survived because of the AIDS medication that eventually saved millions of lives.
Then, a few days ago, we all read on the front pages of newspapers the amazing story that cancer death rates (age-adjusted) have fallen to their lowest level in decades. Millions of lives saved. We are winning the race for the cure remarkably quickly. The decline in the death rate is due in part to the considerable drop in smoking but also because of new drug therapies and treatments to combat tumors.
Deaths from heart disease have also fallen dramatically in recent decades, though, in recent years, obesity in America has slowed progress. Still, new wonder drugs to deal with stroke and diabetes have played a major role. According to a government report: "The total age-adjusted rates for mortality per 100,000 changed from 266.5 in 1999 to 165.0 in 2017 for heart disease, from 61.6 to 37.6 for stroke, from 25.0 to 21.5 for diabetes."
The public is roughly twice as likely to survive a cancer diagnosis or a heart attack today as they would have four decades ago.
Then, I turned on the TV and listened to the politicians vilify drug companies as public enemies. Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren refers to pharmaceutical firms as "corrupt cartels" that "rig the rules, insulate themselves from accountability, and line their pockets at the expense of American families." Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders has likened drug company CEOs to murderers and says that, when they raise prices too much, we should "put them in jail."
On the Republican side of the aisle, President Trump says that the drug companies "get away with murder" and that he wants to force down drug prices, however possible.
CNBC recently noted that attacking drug companies is one of the remaining bipartisan activities in Washington.
Now, I will openly confess that I have received funding from the pharmaceutical industry, but even I find fault from time to time with some of the pricing activities of big pharma. It is outrageous that the public often has to pay twice for drugs developed here than what the Canadians, the Germans, and the Japanese pay.
But it is an industry that should be celebrated, not denigrated. It's the ultimate example of how free market capitalism and the profit motive save lives.
The New York Times recently wrote an editorial protesting high drug prices charged to consumers. They wrote:
The proposed law would enable the Health and Human Services secretary to negotiate prices directly with drugmakers on as many as 250 prescription drugs that Medicare spends the most money on. It would cap the final price based on the average paid by several peer nations, including Australia, Britain, and Canada. The pharmaceutical industry could lose as much as $1 trillion in profits over a decade, and, as a result, would bring roughly eight to 15 fewer drugs to market during that time period (out of the 300 or so that would be expected), the Congressional Budget Office estimates.
By the way, that is only during the first 8, 10, or 12 years while the firms hold the patent for the new drug, which can easily cost $1 billion or more to invent and test. Then, prices for drugs, vaccines, and medical equipment fall forever after, and radically, thus benefiting all of humanity. To its credit, the New York Times conceded that drug price controls will save consumers money but will also delay for a year or two or three the introduction of new drugs. They came down on the side of lower prices.
But if we go in this direction, we should recognize the trade-off. Economist Milton Friedman used to say that when government regulation or price controls delay the introduction of a new drug that saves 50,000 lives a year, the government policies are, in effect, killing 50,000 people a year.
A one-year delay can cost a superstar such as Freddie Mercury his life or the life of a loved one who has cancer. Is it worth it? You decide.

HOUSE PANEL SET TO WEIGH IN ON WEED: The House Energy and Commerce’s Health Subcommittee is holding a hearing next week that will look at whether to deschedule marijuana.
Cannabis faces a patchwork of regulations and rules. It still remains illegal at the federal level even though it has been legalized for recreational reasons in 14 states and for medical reasons in 33 states. At the same time, the Food and Drug Administration is set to issue rules for CBD, the chemical derived from hemp that its users say helps them with stress and sleep. The agency has sent almost two dozen warning letters to companies that have falsely marketed their products.
The House hearing ahead, titled “Cannabis Policies for the New Decade,” is going to look at CBD as well as medical research for marijuana. Roughly two-thirds of the country supports legalizing marijuana, a steep climb from 12% support in 1970, according to Gallup.
Advocates have their eyes on the Marijuana Opportunity, Reinvestment, and Expungement Act, which was approved in the House Judiciary Committee. The bill would not only deschedule marijuana, but it would also expunge criminal records of those with marijuana-related conviction and add a 5% sales tax to products. The money would be reinvested into communities for programs such as job and literacy training, and would provide loans for small businesses who sell marijuana.
The National Cannabis Industry Association held a Reddit AMA Wednesday to highlight different measures they support. The ultimate goal for them is to have marijuana be de-scheduled, but still regulated, so that it’ll be treated similarly to alcohol and tobacco, but there are other changes that could help to loosen current restrictions. The STATES Act, for example, would recognize the legalization of marijuna at the state level.
The group is also hopeful that the Senate Banking Committee will mark up the SAFE Banking Act, which has 33 cosponsors and already passed the House. Mitch McConnell, however, opposes overhauls to cannabis laws, so they don’t expect to get a floor vote this session. The bill would allow cannabis companies to access banking and financial services so they don’t have to keep relying on cash to run their businesses.

LATEST OBAMACARE ENROLLMENT: About 8.3 million people selected or were automatically re-enrolled in plans using the HealthCare.gov during the 2020 open enrollment period. We’re still waiting to hear from states, some of whom run their own exchanges, and to see how many of that 8.3 million pay the first month of premiums.
TRUMP’S PUBLIC CHARGE RULE HITS ANOTHER WALL, AT LEAST FOR NOW: The 2nd U.S. Court of Appeals refused to invalidate an injunction blocking the Trump administration’s “public charge” rule, which seeks to withhold green cards from immigrants likely to require government assistance including healthcare and food stamps. The court also set a deadline, Feb. 14, for the administration to submit legal documents to appeal a lower court’s decision to block the rule, Reuters reported Wednesday.
RBG IS CANCER-FREE: Ruth Bader Ginsburg, 86, one of four liberal justices on the Supreme Court, announced in a CNN interview that she is cancer-free after undergoing treatment for a malignant tumor on her pancreas. The tumor, which was discovered in July 2019 after a routine blood test, was the latest in a spate of health scares and her fourth treatment for cancer since her nomination to the Supreme Court in 1993 by President Bill Clinton. Ginsburg underwent surgery to remove cancerous nodules from her left lung last year, having found them after suffering broken ribs from a fall. She had undergone treatment for pancreatic cancer in 2009 and for colorectal cancer before that in 1999. She was hospitalized last November for unrelated “fevers and chills.” Earlier that same month she missed oral arguments due to the stomach flu, but was back to work just a day later.
Every time she gets sick, Democrats hold their breath: Democrats have been uneasy about RBG’s health scares since the start of Trump’s tenure, fearing he will get the chance to nominate a third justice to the nine-member court. The death of Antonin Scalia led to Trump’s first nominee, Neil Gorsuch, taking a seat on the bench, and Brett Kavanaugh took up Anthony Kennedy’s seat after he retired. When news came out that she was cancer-free, Democrats and even some Republicans breathed a sigh of relief. RBG received an outpouring of support on Twitter, with messages like, “Good, now give her a flu shot and stick her in a goddamn bubble.”
HHS DECLARES A PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY IN PUERTO RICO: Health and Human Services declared a public health emergency in Puerto Rico Wednesday a day after a 6.4 magnitude earthquake left most of the island without electricity and clean water. Aftershocks still rock the island and many, according to CNN, have been afraid to go indoors for fear of being crushed if another shock topples more buildings.
Puerto Rican officials and residents have said the quake was worse than Hurricane Maria, which ravaged the island two years ago. "With the hurricane, you knew when and at what time it would arrive," Tatiana Rodriguez, 28, told CNN. "This, you don't know at what time it's going to happen." Puerto Rican officials are still waiting on billions in funding from the government to help the island recover after the category 4 hurricane. North Carolina Democrat David Price said to the Washington Post: “I think it puts a considerable burden on the administration to show good faith… And in this case, good faith involves not just responding to this latest disaster, but cleaning up from the previous one as well.”
IN EBOLA’S SHADOW, MEASLES HAS RAVAGED THE CONGO: Doctors Without Borders reported last month that 310,000 people in the Democratic Republic of the Congo have contracted measles and at least 6,000 have died due to a lack of access to medical facilities for treatment and a vaccine shortage throughout the country. In the last week of November alone, 9,605 new measles cases were confirmed and the fatality rate in 2019 was higher than it had been in previous years. Some regions in the country have dangerously low vaccination rates, and access to more vaccines is limited. The national vaccine program in the Congo is stretched thin and many people don’t have access to treatment facilities where they live.
Doctors on the ground say that a heightened response to Ebola outbreaks around the country have taken resources away from treating and preventing other infectious diseases, measles included. “When medical staff and equipment are already limited, epidemiological surveillance and medical care for patients may deteriorate for other diseases such as measles,” said Dr. Nicolas Peyraud, a Doctors Without Borders vaccination referent.

TRUMP UNVEILS NATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY ACT OVERHAUL: The Trump administration unveiled long-awaited proposed reforms to the National Environmental Policy Act on Thursday, in what could be its most significant deregulatory action.
NEPA “affects nearly every decision made by the federal government that affects the environment,” Interior Secretary David Bernhardt said at a White House address with President Trump, other administration officials, and industry stakeholders. “It will be the most significant deregulatory proposal you will implement.”
Trump, a real estate developer in his private life, has taken a hands-on approach with the administration’s new proposed rules to quicken federal approval of highways, bridges, energy projects, and other infrastructure, updating NEPA for the first time in 40 years.
He notably never mentioned pipelines, oil and gas leases, or other energy projects in his address, despite criticism from environmentalists and Democrats who say his real intent is to encourage more fossil fuel development while limiting consideration of climate change in permitting reviews.
“Critical infrastructure projects are tied up and bogged down by an outrageously burdensome federal approval process,” Trump said. “We are going to have very strong regulation but it's going to go quickly.”
His administration's proposed updates to regulations governing NEPA seek to limit reviews to two years — “ideally less than that,” Trump said — compared to an average of four-and-a-half now, while making it more difficult for environmentalists and others to challenge projects in court.
The administration also proposes to allow agencies to consider fewer alternatives for the path of a project so that options considered are “technically and economically feasible.” The changes would exempt projects from NEPA reviews that require little federal funding or involvement.
The climate change angle: Most critically for environmental advocates, the proposal does not require agencies to measure the “cumulative” environmental impacts of actions.
The Trump administration wants to narrow the definition of environmental effects, so agencies focus less on long-term, i.e. cumulative, impacts such as climate change and more on immediate, tangible factors that closely relate to a proposed project.
Changing the metrics could reverse a recent trend of courts citing climate change in blocking projects.
However, Mary Neumayr, chairwoman of the White House Council on Environmental Quality, told Josh in an exclusive interview that the Trump administration proposal “does not exclude greenhouse gas emissions" from being considered in reviews.
“We want to ensure agencies are focused on the most significant environmental impacts,” she said.

‘INDUSTRY IS WRONG’: Congressman John Shimkus of Illinois, a Republican leader on the Energy and Commerce Committee, likely won’t be supporting bipartisan legislation to address greenhouse gas refrigerants.
The committee will hear testimony next week on the bipartisan bill, introduced Tuesday by Democrat Paul Tonko of New York and Republican Pete Olson of Texas. The legislation would target emissions of hydrofluorocarbons, or HFCs, refrigerant chemicals that are potent greenhouse gases.
Shimkus’ opposition comes despite near-unanimous support for the legislation from appliance manufacturers and chemical makers and an already strong bipartisan backing, more than 30 co-sponsors, for the Senate companion bill.
“Without the proposed law, American businesses are left in an uncertain position in a highly competitive global market for next generation fluorocarbon technologies,” said Kevin Fay, director of the industry group Alliance for Responsible Atmospheric Policy.
Why Shimkus doesn’t like it: The bill would ensure industry is able to implement a global HFC deal struck during the Obama administration. Shimkus said he doesn’t think that international agreement is needed.
“I think they’re trying to, again, cover their rear ends,” Shimkus said of companies backing the bill. “It’s a big sector, too, so we’re always also concerned about the smaller individual companies and entities that may not be able to have the full force of the mighty large corporate perspective.”
An industry-backed study in 2018 said phasing down HFCs, as the bill would do, could create 33,000 new manufacturing jobs in the U.S.
2019 BY THE CLIMATE NUMBERS: Massive flooding, particularly in the Midwest, was the extreme weather event with the biggest impact in 2019, according to new climate data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
Flooding in Missouri, Arkansas, and the Mississippi River basin alone cost $20 billion, nearly half of the U.S. total disaster costs last year, NOAA said in a news release Wednesday. 2019 was also the second-wettest year since 1973.
Alaska also broke a record: 2019 was the hottest year on record for the state, with temperatures more than 6 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than average.
HOUSE DEMOCRATS’ BIG CLIMATE PLAN: It’s a comprehensive framework they say will get to a 100% clean economy by 2050, and they’re confident they can build consensus around it.
That consensus might not include their Republican colleagues, though. House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Frank Pallone of New Jersey told reporters Wednesday he wouldn’t be waiting for Republicans to try to move the plan or pieces of it. And House Republican committee leaders told reporters they hadn’t even seen the plan yet.
“We would love to have Republicans, but it’s hard when there’s so many climate deniers,” Pallone said during a news conference.
What’s in the plan: The framework includes building on or retooling existing federal and state authorities to deal with climate change. For example, it would set up a program, directed by the Environmental Protection Agency, through which states would submit plans to reach a 100% clean economy, similar to state plans for national air quality standards.
More on what’s in the plan, which Democrats say is the basis for a discussion draft bill they’re releasing later this month, in Abby’s story from Wednesday.
SUNRISE CHOOSES BERNIE: The youth climate movement demanding a Green New Deal thinks Bernie Sanders is the guy to make it happen.
The Sunrise Movement announced it is backing Sanders with a tweet Thursday. In a longer statement, the group says their endorsement comes after a six-week long consideration process, during which they determined Sanders would provide “the best political terrain” to enact a Green New Deal. The movement also praised Sanders’ “consistency” on climate change across his political career.
Runner-up: Sunrise stressed their endorsement for Sanders wasn’t an “indictment” on other candidates — a line that was directed in large part to Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, Sanders’ progressive rival.
Warren received 17.4% of the movement’s vote for an endorsement, the group said. Nonetheless, Sunrise has also been critical of Warren in recent weeks, particularly for her pledge to support the new NAFTA trade deal.
DOE CHALLENGES ITSELF ON ENERGY STORAGE: The Energy Department wants to hold itself accountable for boosting “next-generation” energy storage technologies, announcing an initiative Wednesday to accelerate their deployment.
The Energy Storage Grand Challenge aims to mix R&D funding opportunities, prizes, partnerships, and other programs in order to meet a suite of goals by 2030.
DOE wants to strengthen U.S. manufacturing and supply chain for storage technologies, reducing dependence on foreign sources for critical minerals.
It also looks to accelerate technology transfer to speed up the process of moving from research to system design to use in the private sector. And it aims to bolster workforce training to “meet the needs of the 21st century electric grid and energy storage value chain.”

Stop negotiating with Iran as if we have any shared goals or interests

Texto completo: Iranians aren’t exactly in a position to be making demands, but there is one that we should happily oblige: Stop pretending that we share any common interests or goals.
Everyone needs to read this, as reported by the New York Times on Wednesday, the day after Iran targeted military bases harboring U.S. soldiers in Iraq:
In a televised address from the holy city of Qom, Ayatollah Khamenei said incremental military actions against the United States alone were “not sufficient.” “What matters is that the presence of America, which is a source of corruption in this region, should come to an end,” he said to a hall filled with imams and others. “Death to America!,” the crowd chanted. “Death to Israel!” Ayatollah Khamenei said that “sitting at the negotiating table” with American envoys would open the door to greater American intervention in the region and that such negotiations therefore must “come to an end.”
No part of that sounds like a country that wants to reach an agreement with us, let alone like we have anything in common.
Yet President Trump said in his remarks at the White House on Wednesday that he wanted our Western allies to work together in an effort to reach some “deal” with Iran.
A stern editorial by the Washington Post later that day said that while military hostilities between the U.S. and Iran appeared to have stalled, the administration should “begin serious negotiations with the Islamic republic.”
Serious negotiations for what? We don’t share any interests or goals. This would be like asking a lion and a zebra to simply “work it out.” The zebra wants to be left alone with its other zebra friends. The lion wants to eat the zebra. There’s no bridging that gap.
Here’s what the U.S. has wanted for Iran and every other broken country in the Middle East for the last 40 years: democracy, human rights, a robust economy, the rejection of terrorism, and a disinterest in the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Here’s what Iran and every other broken country in the Middle East have continued to want: theocracy, servitude of the masses, the rejection of Western civilization, and perpetual war with Israel.
As with the lion and the zebra, there’s no bridging that gap either.
Iran doesn’t want to negotiate with the U.S., so let’s stop trying to force it.

Marlboro Man rides into the sunset

Texto completo: You may notice it the most when you come home from a restaurant or bar and your clothes don't smell of smoke. Or, maybe it's when you do get a whiff of cigarette smoke that you realize your nose is more sensitive to it. If you're a smoker, though, you note the disappearance of cigarette smoking by how many fewer places allow you to light up.
But here's where scientists have noticed the decline of smoking in the United States: cancer death rates.
The rate of people dying of cancer each year took a nosedive between 2016 and 2017, tumbling 2.2%, which is more than it has declined during any other year on record, according to a recent report by the American Cancer Society.
"It seems to be driven by accelerating declines in lung cancer mortality," Rebecca Siegel, scientific director for surveillance research at the society, told NPR.
That means the steady decline of cancer deaths in the U.S., while aided by developing technology, has primarily benefited from a declining population of smokers.
Before anti-smoking campaigns of the late '60s, smoking was a status symbol, and the Marlboro Man was a model of Americana.
"The Marlboro Man stood as an iconic symbol, an individual in control of his destiny," media studies professor Barry Vacker told the New York Times. "He was a reassuring figure at the height of our fear of nuclear annihilation and a conservative counter to changing values."
Now, as smoking has become less prevalent, the ripple effect has extended to future generations. Robert Norris, one of television's Marlboro men, was not a smoker. When he realized the ads weren't setting a good example for his children, he gave them up.
Our role models are different these days, for better and worse. Our restaurants are laid out differently, too — there are no more smoking sections. Our clothes even smell different. All of these cultural changes are part of the same shift that has registered, in a good way, in our morbidity tables.

Texto completo: They were two women who defined, and in some cases became emblematic of, the treatment of mental illness, though opposite in every way. One was a career scientist obsessed with how the human brain works; the other an author who found her life's meaning only after publishing her memoir at the ripe old age of 27. One lived a long and full life out of the public eye, dying so quietly that her passing was not even mentioned in the media until months later; the other, arguably, craved and needed the world's attention and, dying young, commanded the headlines.
Dr. Heather Ashton, who died at the age of 90 in her home in England in September, tirelessly researched benzodiazepines such as Xanax and how they were used and abused in the treatment of depression. Elizabeth Wurtzel, author of Prozac Nation: Young and Depressed in America, which brought mental illness to the forefront of popular discussion and exposed an epidemic of sadness taking root among Generation X in the mid-1990s, died this week of cancer. She was 52.
Wurtzel took a chance publishing her debut memoir back in 1994, both because it was rare to see a memoir from someone so young and, as yet, unknown, and because it was the first glimpse many had into the sometimes-twisted world of mental illness and, specifically, depression. Wurtzel's book pulled the curtain back on the struggles of so many, particularly among her generation, and contributed markedly to eliminating the stigma around mental illness and its treatment.
Gen Xers, according to the British medical journal Lancet, are diagnosed with clinical depression at a rate three times that of previous generations, but researchers say that's not because they're suffering more. It's because they're seeking treatment, seeing therapists, and taking drugs such as Prozac — and that's in part because Wurtzel was so candid, for better or worse.
"Elizabeth Wurtzel didn't just change the memoir game," Lindsey Adler of the Athletic wrote in a tweet this week. "She helped brush back the stigma of psychiatric treatment for mental health issues. Her work did important things and yet, she wasn't always taken seriously because of those issues. She suffered for her candor."
Indeed, Wurtzel was roundly mocked for her confessional style, even though she was also widely copied. Her dark prose came to define a certain profile of Generation X — one not always so flattering. Eventually, even Wurtzel criticized herself in a 2013 piece for the New Yorker. But that didn't make her any less iconic.
After publishing several other books, including collections of her essays and a follow-up to her memoir, Wurtzel attended Yale Law School. She graduated with her J.D. in 2008 but continued writing rather than practicing law. She announced that she'd been diagnosed with breast cancer in 2015 in her signature way: Cancer, she said, "like many things that happen to women is mostly a pain in the ass. But compared with being 26 and crazy and waiting for some guy to call, it's not so bad. If I can handle 39 breakups in 21 days, I can get through cancer."
She passed away from complications from metastatic breast cancer on Jan. 7.
Across the pond, Ashton struggled with the fallout from the steep increase in depression diagnoses, helping those who found solace in medications such as Xanax manage the long-term consequences of the drug, including dependence and addiction.
She led a withdrawal clinic, reportedly treating and studying patients who struggled with the drugs and tailoring drug schedules and treatment programs with such precision that her work formed the foundation for how depression patients, such as Wurtzel, are treated today. She also helped to modernize prescribing practices for antidepressants, helping to ensure fewer people who have mental illness also deal with addiction.
"Her work both honored her patients and turned out to be more helpful than any randomized, controlled trial,” Dr. Anna Lembke, the head of Stanford's Addiction Medicine Dual Diagnosis Clinic, told the New York Times.
And Ashton is still at work, despite passing away. She discovered that patients who used and abused benzodiazepines were more likely to abuse opioids, and she created one of the first road maps for treating opioid dependence — a modern American crisis.
“Basically, we now recommend using the same kind of interventions that are used to address the opioid crisis to address the benzodiazepine overprescribing crisis,” Lembke went on. “Dr. Ashton was the vanguard of that change.”
Her work may have very well helped Wurtzel's contemporaries, helping to create a safe and well-researched landscape for treating their illnesses just as the need was greatly expanding, thanks to Wurtzel's candor. Together, the pair helped to evolve the diagnosis, treatment, and acceptance of depression. And together, the pair revolutionized the world for those who have mental illness, each making it, in their own way, safer.

Texto completo: Washington • Sen. Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, insisted Wednesday that Speaker Nancy Pelosi accept his terms for President Donald Trump’s impeachment trial and promptly deliver the charges from the House, as a growing number of Senate Democrats signaled that they, too, were eager to begin the proceeding.
A day after he announced that he had the votes to conduct a trial without agreeing to Democrats’ demands for witnesses, McConnell said that the House had no choice now but to end “shameless game-playing” and transmit the two articles of impeachment against Trump that it approved last month.
“There will be no haggling with the House over Senate procedure,” McConnell, R-Ky., said on the Senate floor. “We will not cede our authority to try this impeachment. The House’s turn is over. The Senate has made its decision.”
Although they voiced deference to the speaker, a growing number of Senate Democrats said Wednesday that they were losing patience with the delay and wanted the trial to begin.
“It’s pretty clear there is not going to be any agreement,” said Sen. Doug Jones, D-Ala. and the most politically vulnerable Democratic incumbent. “The rules are going to be what they are, and she should know that now, so let’s just go ahead.”
Liberals and senior lawmakers joined the call as well.
“I don’t see what good delay does,” said Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the senior senator from Pelosi’s home state, California.
[ Read more: Sen. Mitt Romney says Senate should hear from John Bolton in impeachment trial ]
Their impatience fueled a growing sense in both chambers that three weeks after the House voted to impeach Trump, Pelosi may soon act to start the trial.
Pelosi has been withholding the charges in an unusual bid to help Democrats press their case that any fair trial must include the guarantee of new witnesses and documents. On Tuesday evening, she demanded that McConnell make public his proposed rules for the proceeding before she delivered the articles so that Democrats could “see the arena in which we will be participating.”
But McConnell appeared in no rush to do so. Citing the heightened tensions in the Middle East — where Iran fired missiles at U.S. forces in Iraq early Wednesday — the Senate leader charged that the speaker was playing a dangerous game on impeachment at the worst possible time.
“At the very same time a global crisis was unfolding in real time, she published another ‘Dear colleague’ letter saying she intends to keep our commander in chief in this limbo indefinitely,” McConnell said.
The pointed remarks were the latest in an escalating confrontation between two of the most powerful leaders Congress has seen in a generation.
McConnell, 78, and Pelosi, 79, each of whom has served for more than three decades, are considered master tacticians in their parties, and neither is known for backing down from a contentious fight. Both have a keen understanding of the political dynamics in their rank and file and excel at consolidating their colleagues around a single position and refusing to budge.
McConnell’s objective in the current battle is to bring about a speedy acquittal of the president, belittling the House’s case in the process. He went to the White House on Wednesday afternoon on other business, but spoke with the president about the impending trial, according to a person with knowledge of the meeting. Democrats have already accused the majority leader of too closely coordinating with the defense.
Pelosi, having carefully orchestrated the impeachment vote in the House, does not want to allow the Senate to quickly bury the matter without delving into additional witness accounts or documents. And if she cannot force McConnell to agree to those terms, she is determined at least to convince the public that the Senate trial is illegitimate — and, by extension, that Trump’s acquittal was rigged from the start.
The two leaders, whose relationship has grown chillier in recent years, have not spoken directly about impeachment stalemate, instead carrying out their terse exchanges in speeches and through the news media.
The latest comments from McConnell came in response to a letter from Pelosi to House colleagues late Tuesday in which she accused him of putting his loyalty to the president above the Constitution. In recent weeks, she has also referred to McConnell as “rogue” and complicit in a cover-up of what she described as the president’s misbehavior.
She said she needed details about what a trial would look like so she could choose the team that will prosecute the House’s case that Trump abused his power and then obstructed Congress. The charges stem from a House inquiry that concluded Trump pressured Ukraine to investigate his political rivals in a bid to bolster his reelection campaign and then sought to conceal his actions from legislative oversight.
While Pelosi is widely expected to pick Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif. and the Intelligence Committee chairman who oversaw the House’s Ukraine inquiry, to lead the team of managers, she is still weighing the size and makeup of the rest of the team.
The White House’s own defense team remains in flux. In addition to Pat A. Cipollone, the White House counsel, and his deputies, Trump and his advisers are still weighing whether to offer formal trial roles to Reps. Jim Jordan of Ohio and John Ratcliffe of Texas, two Republicans who led his defense in the House with flair.
On Wednesday, McConnell reiterated that he intended to closely follow the model of President Bill Clinton’s 1999 impeachment trial, delaying any consideration of additional witnesses or evidence not included in the House inquiry until opening arguments are complete and senators have a chance to question the prosecution and defense.
In 1999, those procedures garnered unanimous support from senators, but Democrats this time are expected to oppose them en masse. The facts of the cases are simply different, they argue. Then, every witness of consequence had been questioned and their testimony made public before the trial began. Trump, on the other hand, succeeded in the fall in blocking the testimony of a dozen top officials and did not produce a single document to investigators.
At least three Senate Republicans have indicated they are open to potentially calling witnesses like John Bolton, the former national security adviser who said this week he would be willing to testify. But Democrats would have to find a fourth Republican willing to join with them to muster the majority needed to do so.
With Pelosi firmly backed by her own caucus, McConnell tried Wednesday to drive a wedge between Democrats in the House and the Senate to increase pressure on the speaker.
He said Pelosi’s leverage to influence the Senate was “nonexistent” and urged Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. and the Democratic leader, to listen to his own members who want the trial to begin quickly.
“The Democratic leader does not need to continue to be in thrall to the speaker,” McConnell said of Schumer. “He does not need to keep colluding with outside efforts to supplant the judgment of his own colleagues.”
Schumer offered the majority leader and Republican senators a warning in his own speech on the Senate floor. Schumer said he would force votes on calling witnesses and documents during the trial and the nation could judge at the ballot box the actions of each lawmaker.
“If the Senate rushes through the president’s impeachment — if we actually fail to try the case, as the Constitution demands — then the true acquittal the president craves will be unobtainable,” he said. “The American people will see right through a partisan trial and understand that a rush to judgment rendered that moot.”

Texto completo: Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, whose health has become a preoccupation of the American public as the Supreme Court hews rightward under President Donald Trump, announced this week that she was cancer-free.
Ginsburg, 86, one of four liberal justices on the nine-member court, told CNN on Tuesday that treatment for a malignant tumor on her pancreas had been successful.
Her doctors discovered the tumor in July after a routine blood test, and a biopsy at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City confirmed a localized malignant tumor.
“I’m cancer-free,” Ginsburg said in the interview, adding that she had resumed an active schedule.
This was the fourth time that Ginsburg, who was nominated to the court by President Bill Clinton in 1993, had undergone cancer treatment.
In 2018, surgeons removed two malignant nodules from Ginsburg’s left lung and determined the cancer had not spread. In 2009, she had surgery for early-stage pancreatic cancer, and in 1999 she was treated for colon cancer without missing a day on the bench.
The five-year survival rate for pancreatic cancer that is localized is 37%, according to the National Cancer Institute. But many patients don’t show symptoms — which include abdominal pain, jaundice, lack of appetite and weight loss — until the pancreatic cancer has spread to other organs, according to medical experts.
In 53% of pancreatic cancer cases in the United States, the cancer has metastasized to distant organs, which the National Cancer Institute said decreases the five-year survival rate to 2.9%.
Ginsburg’s health challenges have made Democrats uneasy about another retirement or vacancy on the court while Trump is president. Since taking office, Trump has nominated two justices to the nine-member court: Neil Gorsuch after the death of Antonin Scalia and Brett Kavanaugh to replace Anthony Kennedy, who had been considered the swing vote on the court before his retirement in 2018.

Trump moves to exempt big projects from environmental review

Texto completo: Washington • The White House on Thursday will introduce the first major changes to the nation’s bench mark environmental protection law in more than three decades, moving to ease approval of pipelines and other major energy and infrastructure projects without detailed environmental review.
Many of the changes to the 50-year-old National Environmental Policy Act, a landmark measure that touches nearly every significant construction project in the country, have been long sought by the oil and gas industry, whose members applauded the move and called it long overdue.
White House officials Thursday morning declined to comment on the proposed regulations, which will be formally released later in the day. One person familiar with the announcement said the administration would highlight a replacement of the Herbert C. Bonner Bridge in North Carolina, which took more than 20 years because of federal reviews. Administration officials will argue that the changes will help projects like that one move faster.
Under the law, major federal projects like bridges, highways, pipelines or power plants that will have a significant impact on the environment require a review, or environmental impact statement, outlining potential consequences. The proposed new rules, which guide the way the law is implemented, will narrow the range of projects that demand such a review. It will do that by creating a new category of “non-major” federal actions that can move forward without any assessment, according to two government officials familiar with the regulation.
In some cases the federal government merely funds studies for small infrastructure projects, which triggers a required environmental review.
But the proposed regulation does not set a dollar threshold for what constitutes a large federal footprint, which one official said could also allow major mining, drilling and other projects to avoid environmental assessments. That lack of definition is highly likely to prompt lawsuits from environmental organizations.
“Our country is at a pivotal time for American energy,” said Anne Bradbury, chief executive of the American Exploration & Production Council, which represents independent operators.
She praised the administration for clarifying the regulations and creating what she described as a more-efficient process that “removes bureaucratic barriers that were stifling construction of key infrastructure projects.”
Environmental groups said the revisions would threaten species and lead to more greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. The proposed regulations also will relieve federal agencies of having to take climate change into account in environmental reviews.
The proposal will not mention the words “climate change” but will say that agencies no longer must consider the “cumulative” consequences of new infrastructure. Courts have interpreted that requirement as a mandate to study the effects of allowing more planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere. It also has meant understanding the impacts of rising sea levels and other results of climate change on a given project.
That means agencies will not have to examine whether a pipeline, mine or other fossil fuel project would worsen climate change. It also means there will not be any requirement to understand how or whether a road or bridge in a coastal area would be threatened by sea-level rise.
Richard L. Revesz, a professor of environmental law at New York University, said he did not believe the changes would hold up in court. He noted that the Environmental Policy Act requires that all the environmental consequences of a project be taken into account, and that core requirement cannot be changed by fiat.
“A regulation can’t change the requirements of a statute as interpreted by the courts,” Revesz said. In fact, he argued, it is more likely that federal agencies will be sued for inadequate reviews, “thereby leading to far longer delays than if they had done a proper analysis in the first place.”

Texto completo: Much of the work of H.P. Lovecraft, an American horror and science fiction writer who worked during the first decades of the 20th century, is defined by individual encounters with the incomprehensible, with sights, sounds and ideas that undermine and disturb reality as his characters understand it. Faced with things too monstrous to be real, but which exist nonetheless, Lovecraftian protagonists either reject their senses or descend into madness, unable to live with what they’ve learned.
It feels, at times, that when it comes to Donald Trump, our political class is this Lovecraftian protagonist, struggling to understand an incomprehensibly abnormal president. The reality of Donald Trump — an amoral narcissist with no capacity for reflection or personal growth — is evident from his decades in public life. But rather than face this, too many people have rejected the facts in front of them, choosing an illusion instead of the disturbing truth.
The past week has been a prime example of this phenomenon. On Thursday night, the United States killed Gen. Qassem Soleimani of Iran, leader of the Quds Force and one of the most powerful military leaders in the region. The strike was sudden and unexpected. The White House notified Congress only after the fact, with a brief, classified document.
The assassination of Soleimani was tantamount to a declaration of war and has escalated tensions between the United States and Iran. Tehran has already promised “harsh revenge” against the United States, while Trump said he would “HIT VERY FAST AND VERY HARD” if Iran made good on its threat, vowing an attack on “52 Iranian sites” including locations “important to Iran & the Iranian culture.”
This standoff, which in its latest incarnation saw Iranian missiles sailing toward bases in western Iraq on Tuesday night, is so consequential that it’s been hard not to impute some logic to the president’s actions, even as many observers acknowledge the lies and dysfunction surrounding the attack. It’s only natural. As humans, we want to impose order on what we see. As Americans, we want to believe our leaders understand the gravity of war. Traditional news outlets published detailed descriptions of the president’s decision-making process. Sympathetic observers, like Matthew Continetti of the Washington Free Beacon, hailed the strike as a “stunning blow to international terrorism and a reassertion of American might.” Cable news analysts spoke as if this was part of a considered plan for challenging the Iranian government.
But we’ve learned since that the strike on Soleimani was almost certainly another impulsive action from an impatient president. Pentagon officials have said they were stunned by the decision. According to reporting in The Times, they gave Trump the option of an attack with the expectation that he would reject it for being too extreme. Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have been pushing for an attack on Iran for some time, but the past few days of confusion — of mixed-messages and shifting rationales — are evidence that this strike was made with little thought to the consequences, justified after the fact with claims of imminent danger.
This is reckless but it isn’t shocking. Trump is not a steady hand. He’s never been one. Three years in office have neither changed his character nor enhanced his capabilities. He is as ignorant and incurious as a president as he was as a candidate (and as a would-be mogul before that). His main goal is self-preservation, and he’ll sacrifice anything to achieve it. His current assault on the authority of Congress — his refusal to have the White House or members of his administration release documents or obey subpoenas — is an attempt to escape responsibility for his own unethical (and potentially illegal) actions. He is self-involved, unethical and unstable — a dangerous combination to have for the commander-in-chief of the world’s most powerful military forces, under pressure from impeachment and a re-election campaign.
I think most observers know this. But the implications are terrifying. They suggest a much more dangerous world than the one we already believe we live in, where in a fit of pique, a single action taken by a single man could have catastrophic consequences for millions of people. This isn’t a new observation. When he was still a rival — and not one of Trump’s most reliable allies — Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida warned Republicans that they shouldn’t give “the nuclear codes of the United States” to an “erratic individual.” Hillary Clinton said Trump was “temperamentally unfit to hold an office that requires knowledge, stability and immense responsibility” and that “a man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons.”
Fear of what Trump would do with the power of the presidency was so acute that his defenders actually urged critics to ignore his actual words in favor of symbolic understanding, to take him “seriously” but not “literally.” You can even understand the constant drive to normalize Trump as an attempt to turn away from the reality of what he is for fear of what it means.
Somehow, we’re still doing it. Everything we know about Trump says he doesn’t make considered choices. Pence and Pompeo may have campaigned for an attack on Iran, but there’s no evidence that Trump — the actual president — has planned for the consequences, or has a rationale for the strike other than his usual brand of bellicose nationalism. When Iran retaliated Tuesday night, the president did not speak, although of course he tweeted. No one knows what the administration will do next.
In his careless thrashing, the president may have started a war with no plan to end it and no regard for the lives that will be lost. The situation is precarious. It’s scary to think about. But we cannot look away.

Texto completo: An altercation over a man's refusal to remove a "Make America Great Again" hat triggered a recent active shooter scare at a Luzerne County mall, police said.
The altercation started outside when a man confronted another man wearing the hat in support of President Donald Trump inside the Wyoming Valley Mall in Wilkes-Barre, Pa., on Dec. 30, authorities said Tuesday. The man threatened to assault the Trump supporter if he did not remove the hat, then tried to knock it off his head.
Police say the man wearing the hat then pulled a gun out and pointed it at the ground, prompting the other man to flee.
The tense dispute spread on social media and caused a panic at the mall, the Citizens Voice reported.
Wilkes-Barre Township Police Chief Will Clark said firearms are not permitted inside the mall, but the altercation happened near the Macy's inside the mall. The armed man had a concealed carry permit, and Chief Clark said no charges will be filed against him.
Facebook exec's post
Longtime Facebook executive Andrew Bosworth said in a blunt internal post that the company's advertising tools were crucial to the election of President Donald Trump in 2016 and may help him win again, but that executives must resist the temptation to make policy changes that would alter the course of legitimate political debate.
The post, which appeared on the company's internal systems last week and surfaced in news reports Tuesday, reflected the combination of anguish, defensiveness and brash self-confidence that many of the company's employees have more privately expressed in the difficult aftermath of Mr. Trump's unexpected victory.
Mr. Bosworth's post also shed light on the thinking within the company's highest levels as it heads into a new election year amid controversies over its reluctance to police lies by politicians or limit their ability to narrowly target small groups of voters.
Super Bowl ad battle
Michael Bloomberg's presidential campaign has secured a 60-second advertising spot to air nationally during next month's Super Bowl telecast, an ad buy that will most likely cost at least $10 million.
Hours after The New York Times reported Mr. Bloomberg's plans, President Donald Trump's re-election campaign said that it, too, had reserved 60 seconds' worth of advertising during the game for roughly $10 million.
The dueling ads on the year's biggest night of TV are evidence that the two New York billionaires are preparing for a schoolyard brawl on the national airwaves over the coming months, with each increasingly willing to dip into his vast resources - Mr. Bloomberg is spending his own fortune, and Mr. Trump has a nine-figure campaign war chest - to broadcast their messages.

All three itineraries were part of a list, published in The New York Times on Thursday, of 52 destinations recommended to explore around the globe in 2020. Colorado Springs was one of the seven U.S. locations included in the list.
Colorado Springs, “a gateway to alpine vacationlands since trains first arrived in 1871” will “spring anew in 2020,” writes New York Times’ reporter Kathryn O’Shea-Evans.
The list cites April’s opening of the $90 million U.S. Olympic & Paralympic Museum and the debut this fall of the Pikes Peak Summit House as reasons to visit Colorado’s second-largest city.
To fuel one’s travels, the New York Times suggested Nightingale Bread, where they mill their own organic heirloom grain at the Lincoln Center. Or, Four by Brother Luck to try cornbread with wojapi (berry sauce) or another dish inspired by indigenous foods of the Four Corners region.
Fresh trout from Front Range streams can be found on the menu of The Broadmoor hotel: “a pink stucco Italian Renaissance-style resort that looms over the landscape like a fever dream of Gold Rush-era miners,” wrote O’Shea-Evans.
The New York Times compiled the list by polling its Travel Desk and asking for suggestions from its travel writers and frequent travelers.

Robert Rowe: Sen. Collins just playing the game

Texto completo: In her guise as a moderate Republican, Sen. Susan Collins demanded a fair hearing during the Brett Kavanaugh hearings. Then she disappeared behind Mitch McConnell’s nomination process, voting for President Trump’s nominee without hearing all the witnesses.
Deborah Ramirez, a college friend of Kavanaugh, accused the nominee of sexual assault but was denied an opportunity to speak at the hearing. This, after the New York Times reported that, after she gave the F.B.I. a list of at least 25 individuals who may have had corroborating evidence, the Bureau interviewed none of them. According to New York Times reporters Pogrebin and Kelly, agents told Ramirez they found her charges against Kavanaugh “credible.” But a McConnell-controlled Senate had imposed strict limits on the investigation and Ramirez was never called to testify. Collins voted for Kavanaugh, calling it a fair hearing.
Now Collins is saying she will be an impartial juror at Trump’s trial. The thing is, McConnell is still the decider on the process. Collins will use his method for cover when witnesses crucial to the impeachment hearings are not heard. Collins, our “moderate Senator,” will be able to make her “impartial decision” on impeachment without listening to critical witnesses. We’ve seen this movie before.
Collins plays the part of a small-town Mainer who believes in fairness. Beneath this continuing fraud, Collins is just another played-out, partisan politician — cynical, calculating — and without a real “down-home” moral compass to guide her to the heart of the matter — a process leading to justice.

Chloë Sevigny Is Having a Baby With Her Art Gallery Director Boyfriend

Texto completo: In an age where Instagram influencers of all kinds run rampant in this nation’s major metropolitan areas, the iconic below-14th-street heroine Chloë Sevigny still feels like one of the last pure artistic It Girls on the scene in New York City, probably because she came of age just before the Internet democratized the concept of “becoming cool.” Of course, after having starred in a number of interesting movies and participating in countless creative partnerships, Sevigny has far surpassed the constraints of the It Girl moniker, but the identifier seems to fit her all the same. Sevigny’s latest creative endeavor is an adorable one: this week, she confirmed that she’s expecting her first child with her boyfriend Sinisa Mackovic, the director of Karma gallery in the East Village.
Certain outlets have pointed out by that dating and procreating with someone in the fine art industry, Sevigny may be somehow “following in the footsteps” of other stars like Jennifer Lawrence and Jenny Slate, given that Lawrence married gallery director Cooke Maroney last year and that Slate is engaged to a very cute short story writer-slash-gallery director named Ben Shattuck. Sure, making out with art guys might be trendy right now, but make no mistake; Sevigny is 45 years old and she invented dating art guys. She’s been doing it for practically her entire career, and she’s always been more interesting than anyone she’s ever been associated with!

For example, most recently, Sevigny gave an interview to the New York Times style magazine about her most prized possession, which is a tiny sculpture of a bird that was made in prison by Damien Echols. Echols was falsely accused of participating in the murder of three teenagers in 1993, and spent years behind bars practicing magic rituals and making art in order to cope. Sevigny also just completed a collaborative perfume project with the L.A. brand Régime des Fleurs, is acting in Luca Guadagnino’s upcoming HBO series We Are Who We Are and recently made an appearance in Russian Doll on Netflix.
Plus, given that Mackovic is an art connoisseur, he and Sevigny are demonstrably well matched: according to a New York magazine piece from 2012, the actress has a “vast” art collection that includes “a seven-foot-tall Paul Falconer Poole oil painting and controversial Gary Gross photos of a young, naked Brooke Shields.” There’s a 100 percent chance that their baby is going to be cool.

Texto completo: El ataqué iraní de este 8 de enero a bases militares estadounidenses en Irak es el único que Irán ha admitido contra Estados Unidos o sus aliados desde la toma de la embajada estadounidense en 1979. En él se utilizaron misiles balísticos que causaron poco daño pero la capacidad armamentística de Irán es bastante mayor.
Para recordar el potencial del ejército iraní, the New York Times recurre a su inesperado y exitoso ataque contra instalaciones petroleras sauditas hace cuatro meses. En aquel momento, la magnitud y audacia de irán sorprendió sobre manera a oficiales de inteligencia y al propio ejército estadounidense ya que casi ningún país de la región -a excepción, quizá, de Israel- podría haberse detenido de aquel ataque.
Aunque Irán ha negado estar detrás de los ataques a Arabia Saudí, oficiales estadounidenses han estimado que los drones y los misiles salieron desde Irán o desde el sur de Irak . Esta presunción ha llevado a los expertos a concluir que en las últimas décadas Teherán ha cultivado habilidades menos convencionales ideadas para una una hipotética y desproporcionada guerra contra una superpotencia como Estados Unidos.
El Times descata que Irán comanda el arsenal más grande de misiles balísticos y de crucero de la zona. Los oficiales estadounidenses calculan que tiene repartidos por toda la región a 250,000 combatientes de grupos militantes aliados y equipos de hackers que consideran de los más peligrosos del mundo.
Irán también ha desarrollado sofisticados drones armados y de vigilancia y, al no contar con una armada convencional fuerte, ha explotado el flujo de petróleo del golfo Pérsico con una flota de lanchas pequeñas y rápidas un un arsenal de minas submarinas.
El analista Jack Watling, del Royal United Services Institute, considera que “ la capacidad ofensiva de Irán es drásticamente mayor que la capacidad defensiva para contenerla “. “Su habilidad para causar daño significativo hace que el costo de la guerra con Irán sea bastante severo”, añadió Watling.

Douthat: Andrew Jackson in the Persian Gulf

Texto completo: There’s a witticism that makes the rounds on Twitter whenever Donald Trump does something particularly plutocratic or corrupt, a variation on the following: Look, this is what all those folks in Midwestern diners voted for. The sarcastic point being either that Trump’s populism was a con with blue-collar voters as its mark, or else that Trump’s supporters professed to care about his populist promises only as a means to own the libs.
But with the assassination of Qassem Soleimani, I’m afraid that I must deploy the one-liner seriously: This was, in fact, exactly what a certain kind of Trump supporter voted for — including both the downscale, disaffected conservatives who turned out for him in the primary and the blue-collar Obama-Trump moderates who tipped the Midwest in the general election.
Not the killing of Soleimani specifically; like Trump himself on the campaign trail, some of these voters wouldn’t be able to tell the Quds Force from the Kurds. But the strategic spirit behind the killing, the preference for a single act of vengeance over more ambitious forms of intervention, the belief in the hardest possible counterpunch, the dismissal of norms and rules and cautious habits that constrain the violence that America deals out … all this is what Trump promised in the 2016 campaign, with his simultaneous dismissal of both neoconservatism and liberal internationalism and his pledge to crush America’s enemies by any means.
This combined promise was not a contradiction; it was an expression of a practical philosophy of foreign policy, usefully called Jacksonianism, that many Americans and especially many white and rural and working-class Americans have always tended to embrace.
The phrase “Jacksonian” belongs to the foreign policy scholar Walter Russell Mead, part of a famous typology in which he divides U.S. foreign policy tendencies into four worldviews: Hamiltonian, Wilsonian, Jacksonian and Jeffersonian. The worldviews are simplifications (“intended to be suggestive and evocative,” in Mead’s words), and they inevitably frustrate many scholars; nonetheless, they remain a useful way of thinking about how, in our imperial era, U.S. foreign policy tends to work.
The Hamiltonians are the business-minded internationalists, cold-eyed and stability-oriented and wary of wars that seem idealistic rather than self-interested. The Wilsonians are the idealists, whether neoconservative or liberal-humanitarian, who regard the U.S. military as a force for spreading democracy and protecting human rights. Most foreign policy elites belong to one of these two groups, both political parties include both tendencies in their upper echelons, and most recent presidencies have been defined by internal conflicts between the two.
But far more American voters are either Jacksonians or Jeffersonians. The Jeffersonian impulse, more common on the left than on the right, is toward a “come home, America” retreat from empire that regards global hegemony as a corrupting folly and America’s wars as mostly unwise and unjust. (“No blood for oil” is the defining Jeffersonian attitude toward all our Middle Eastern misadventures.) The Jacksonian tendency, more common on the right than on the left, is toward a pugilistic nationalism that’s wary of all international entanglements but ready for war whenever threats arise. (“More rubble, less trouble” is the essential Jacksonian credo.) Since neither tendency has that much purchase in the imperial capital, it’s a safe bet that at any given moment in Washington, D.C., elites in both political parties will be trying to mobilize Jacksonian or Jeffersonian sentiment to achieve Hamiltonian or Wilsonian ends.
But when elites of both persuasions preside over too many calamities, you can get Jeffersonians and Jacksonians as important presidential contenders in their own right — think of George McGovern and George Wallace when the Vietnam War went bad. And when one party’s elite loses control of the electoral process entirely, it turns out that you can get an actual Jacksonian in the White House.
Yes, not everything Trump has done fits Mead’s paradigm — but a great deal of what makes him different from previous presidents is plainly Jacksonian. A Hamiltonian wouldn’t have saber-rattled so wildly against North Korea; a Wilsonian wouldn’t be so subsequently eager for a deal with such an odious regime. A Hamiltonian wouldn’t be as eager for an extended trade war with China; a Wilsonian would speak out more clearly against Beijing’s human rights abuses instead of just treating them as one more bargaining chip. Trump’s bureaucracy-impeded attempts to pull out of Syria and Afghanistan are patently Jacksonian; likewise his disdain for his predecessor’s negotiations on climate change. His eagerness to pardon war criminals and threaten war crimes, meanwhile, are Jacksonianism at its worst.
What is the best of Jacksonianism? I would say it’s the capacity to identify and prioritize threats, an area where Wilsonians get way too expansive and ambitious (“make the world safe for democracy,” “an end to evil”), while Hamiltonians sometimes let realpolitik blind them to ideological enmities that can’t be negotiated away.
To the extent that Trump’s foreign policy has been a useful corrective to his predecessors, and better than what other Republican candidates might have offered, it’s been because of his attempts at just such a prioritization. The execution has been, inevitably, Trumpy, but the goals — drawing down in Syria and Central Asia, confronting China while de-escalating with North Korea, burden-shifting to other NATO powers in Europe while keeping our relationship with Russia cool but short of Cold War hostility — are more strategically reasonable than the Bushian and Clintonite forms of interventionism that Trump campaigned against.
But in Trump’s Iran policy we may be seeing the limits of Jacksonianism, or at least a Jacksonianism that operates in strategic contexts that its own impulses did not create.
The Iranian government is indeed our enemy, to an extent that the Hamiltonians in the Obama administration sometimes underestimated, and in that sense Trump’s hawkishness toward the mullahs fits with his Jacksonian approach. But the Tehran regime’s capacity and inclination to cause problems for America also reflect our regional presence, posture and alliances, which mostly exist to advance a kind of mixtape of Hamiltonian and Wilsonian grand strategies — access to Middle Eastern oil, the promotion of democracy and human rights and regime change in Tehran itself.
None of these are naturally Jacksonian goals, especially now that America is more energy independent than when the Carter Doctrine was formulated or the first Iraq War fought. Were America’s Iran policy fully Jacksonian we might still be at loggerheads with Tehran, but we wouldn’t be nearly so invested in projecting power in the Persian Gulf, and there would be fewer natural flash points and fewer targets for Iranian attacks.
But so long as Trump is working within an inherited Hamiltonian-Wilsonian strategic framework, his Jacksonian tactical approach — in the Soleimani case, picking the most surprising and dramatic option on the military board of retaliatory options — is unlikely to serve his official goal of escaping endless Middle Eastern entanglements. Instead, it points to either a permanent retaliatory cycle with the Iranians — we hit hard, they hit hard, we hit a little harder, ad infinitum — or else a disastrous ground war in a nonessential theater, the least Jacksonian of ends.
Precisely because I think Trump’s Jacksonianism is fundamentally sincere, I don’t think the full-scale war scenario is particularly likely. And since I’ve written numerous columns, before his election and since, about Trump as geopolitical destabilizer without anything as bad as Obama’s still-unfolding Libya folly yet ensuing, it’s important to stress that the fallout from the Suleimani gambit could less dramatic than the panicked punditry expects. Indeed, if the dead general was really the Islamic Republic’s Stonewall Jackson, its asymmetric strategy’s indispensable man, then over the long run his death might benefit U.S. interests more than any subsequent escalation hurts them.
But the most likely near-term consequence of Soleimani’s death is an escalation in hostilities that looks to most Americans like more of the endless war that Trump campaigned against. In which case some war-weary voters might decide that if they really want out of futile Middle Eastern conflicts electing a ruthless Jacksonian is not enough; only a peace-seeking Jeffersonian will do.
And it just so happens that a genuine left-wing Jeffersonian, Bernie Sanders, is currently near the top of the Democratic field, contending with Joe Biden, the embodiment of the Hamiltonian-Wilsonian elite dialectic despite his blue-collar lingo, in an increasingly spirited foreign policy debate.
If the establishment’s follies gave us Trump’s Jacksonian presidency, in other words, the question before the Democratic electorate is whether the perils of Trumpism require that we give that establishment another chance — or whether putting a Jeffersonian in charge of an empire built by Hamiltonians and Wilsonians is the only reasonable option left.

Texto completo: Elizabeth Wurtzel
NEW YORK - Elizabeth Wurtzel, whose blunt and painful confessions of her struggles with addiction and depression in the best-selling "Prozac Nation" made her a voice and a target for an anxious generation, died Tuesday at age 52.
"Prozac Nation" was published in 1994 when Wurtzel was in her mid-20s and set off a debate that lasted for much of her life. Critics praised her for her candor and accused her of self-pity and self-indulgence, vices she fully acknowledged. Wurtzel wrote of growing up in a home torn by divorce, of cutting herself when she was in her early teens, and of spending her adolescence in a storm of tears, drugs, bad love affairs and family fights.
"I don't mean to sound like a spoiled brat," she wrote. "I know that into every sunny life a little rain must fall and all that, but in my case the crisis-level hysteria is an all-too-recurring theme."
Wurtzel became a celebrity, a symbol and, for some, a punchline. Newsweek called her the famously depressed Elizabeth Wurtzel.'' She was widely ridiculed after a 2002 interview with the The Toronto Globe and Mail in which she spoke dismissively of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks from the year before.
I just felt, like, everyone was overreacting. People were going on about it. That part really annoyed me," she said, remarks that she later said were misrepresented.
But many readers embraced her story and would credit her with helping them face their own troubles. News of her death Tuesday was met with expressions of grief and gratitude. The writer Anne Theriault tweeted: "It's hard for me to even articulate how important Prozac Nation was to me at a certain point in my life." Author Sady Doyle lamented that Wurtzel was regarded as a "Sad Example Of Something - female memoir-writers, women who got famous for being themselves, young women generally."
"And to see her gone so young is a harsh reminder of how cruel that was," Doyle tweeted.
Wurtzel's other books included "Bitch: In Praise of Difficult Women" and "More, Now, Again: A Memoir of Addiction." Her essays were published in The New York Times, New York magazine and other publications.
In a 2015 piece for the Times, she described her initial success in fighting her cancer diagnosis.
"I live in an age of miracles and wonders, when they cure cancer with viruses. If I ever meet cancer again, I will figure it out. You see, I am very Jewish, which is to say ... I am undefeated by the worst," she wrote. "But I would have preferred to skip this. That would have been much better."

Texto completo: "The Iron Range is back in business."
President Donald Trump proclaimed the renaissance at a Minneapolis rally last October. "Tremendous jobs," he crowed.
The president was correct, if by "tremendous" he meant jobs for precisely 200 more people. The Iron Range indeed has inched back from its nadir. But at a high -- and unjustifiable -- price to the nation. And, paradoxically, at a cost to the U.S. steel industry.
The month Trump declared the resurrection of the Iron Range, Minnesota employed 7,004 people in mining and logging, up from 6,804 in October 2018.
By way of comparison, state employment in the sector was nearly 500 higher in October 2014 -- the peak for that month in the last decade.
Trump promised that trade wars were easy to win when he imposed tariffs on imported steel in March 2018. When the final 2019 numbers are in, production of iron ore pellets on the Iron Range actually is expected to show a small decline -- to 37 million tons, down from 39.1 million tons in 2018, according to Minnesota Department of Revenue Minerals Tax Office estimates.
In 2018, boosters of the Iron Range were celebrating gains in jobs and production. Fair enough. But how much thought did they -- or Trump, for that matter -- give to a big contributor to the uptick? Iron ore exports were up 42% in the third quarter of that year. Who buys U.S. iron ore exports? Foreigners. Foreigners making steel, such as China.
A White House threat to expand tariffs on Chinese goods recently was lifted, at least for now. But Trump's tax on steel imports from China and Europe -- ultimately paid by U.S. consumers -- remain on thousands of steel parts imported from China and Europe. Higher prices on consumer products contributed to falling demand. The result: the greatest slump in U.S. manufacturing in more than a decade.
In the steel industry, "the protection against imports [had] helped prompt United States producers to invest billions of dollars in new facilities that they hope will be more efficient," the New York Times reported.
"But the price of steel plunged, in part as a result of lower demand from manufacturers, putting pressure on the steelmakers. In December, United States Steel said it was going to indefinitely idle most of a mill near Detroit. Some 1,500 workers from the facility got layoff notices. U.S. Steel also cut its capital spending forecast for this year, to $875 million from $950 million."
Trump's embrace of protectionism has cost more jobs in the steel industry than it has saved. And it's cost American consumers and businesses more than $900,000 a year for every job spared.
For a couple of hundred more taconite workers finding work on the Iron Range, their paychecks doubtlessly are welcome. For the rest of us, those jobs came at a high price.

Texto completo: A record drop in the rate of U.S. cancer deaths, announced Wednesday, has Minnesota specialists encouraged that advances in medical treatment are having an impact alongside preventive measures such as anti-smoking campaigns and colonoscopy screenings.
The American Cancer Society reported Wednesday that the U.S. cancer death rate has declined 29% since 1991, and 2.2% in just one year, from 2016 to 2017 -- the largest one-year drop ever recorded.
While increased cancer screenings help explain the gradual, decadeslong trend, they alone couldn't have caused such a dramatic change in one year, said Matt Flory, an analyst for the Cancer Society's North region, based in Eagan.
"Do people really think smoking [habits] changed that much year over year?" he said. "I think that's a signal that it's not just smoking, but that it's advances in therapy, too."
New treatments include the use of "checkpoint inhibitor" drugs over the past decade, particularly in the treatment of a form of skin cancer known as melanoma, that prevent cancer cells from eluding the human immune system. Testing to identify specific molecules and genetic mutations behind certain cancers has helped doctors create treatments tailored to individual patients, and such testing is becoming cheaper and more widely used.
The overall decline was driven largely by progress in preventing and treating melanoma and lung cancer, though the latter still kills more people than breast, prostate, colorectal and brain cancers combined, the Cancer Society data showed.
Progress has been incremental, said Dr. Douglas Yee, director of the University of Minnesota's Masonic Cancer Center. A new treatment for breast cancer, for example, might work for only the 3% of patients with certain genetic mutations. New guidelines have refined standard chemotherapies so they work better, and new technology has focused radiation beams so they more tightly target tumors rather than healthy tissue.
"Each one may benefit only a small group, but in aggregate, they decrease mortality," Yee said. "The yardage gained is sort of small increments. You don't get the Hail Mary pass that everyone would like."
The melanoma mortality rate began declining by 7% per year among men and women ages 20 to 64, and by 5% to 6% per year in individuals 65 and older, following federal approval in 2011 of two new therapies for the most severe, metastatic versions of the skin cancer.
"That was the largest decline in cancer mortality that we saw," said Rebecca Siegel, director of surveillance research at the American Cancer Society and lead author of the organization's report, which was published online in CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians. "And what made it so dramatic is that for people 65 and older, melanoma mortality rates were actually increasing in the 2000s."
Harnessing T cells
Recent declines in cancer deaths also reflect the launch of immunotherapies that have helped some patients by enlisting so-called T cells to kill their tumors. Both the Mayo Clinic and University of Minnesota have launched CAR-T therapy programs that harvest T cells from patients' immune systems, boost their cancer-fighting properties, and then infuse them back into the patients.
Screening and prevention efforts have played a role, especially in Minnesota. The male cancer death rate in Minnesota for the five-year period ending in 2017 was 179 per 100,000 people, compared with the U.S. rate of 189.3. The state's breast cancer death rate of 10.8 per 100,000 women was among the lowest in the nation.
National survey data showed that 73% of Minnesotans 50 and older were up to date on screenings for colon cancer, compared with a national screening rate of 67%. Flory said recent gains in colon cancer screenings have resulted in more polyps being found in patients' intestines before they reach cancerous stages.
"Everyone is looking for the silver bullet" that caused cancer deaths to drop, he said. "It's a little bit of everything."
National cancer experts urged caution in celebrating the results. Declines in the rates of death from breast and colorectal cancers have begun to taper off, likely due to the rising rate of obesity among Americans, as well as significant racial and geographic disparities in prevention and treatment programs. The decline in the rate of prostate cancer deaths has halted entirely.
Studies have found that obesity, unhealthy diets and a lack of physical activity are associated with metabolic and hormone abnormalities and with chronic inflammation, which may help explain the link to cancer. Controlling these factors could help jump-start declines in cancer incidence and mortality rates once again, said Timothy Rebbeck, an epidemiologist at Harvard University and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.
Still a killer
Cancer remains the second leading cause of death after heart disease in both men and women nationally. The American Cancer Society predicts that in 2020 there will be about 1,806,590 new cancer cases and 606,520 cancer deaths.
"We are still dealing with the effects of cigarette smoking from the 1960s and '70s in today's population," said Dr. Otis Brawley, an oncologist at Johns Hopkins University and former chief scientific officer at the American Cancer Society. Because there is a lag between exposure and cancer diagnosis, people who stopped smoking may develop lung cancer years later. But these rates should continue to decline, Brawley said.
Renewed progress in reducing mortality for breast and other cancers might require organizing and understanding the wealth of information coming from diagnostic and molecular tests, said Dr. Edward Greeno, chief of cancer care for M Health Fairview, based in Minneapolis.
Right now, testing is producing more genetic and molecular information than doctors can effectively analyze and use in treatment planning, he said. "It's not yet information overload, but you can see we're at the beginning of a really steep slope."
In some cases, doctors know of some genetic mutations causing cancers, but treating them one at a time might be ineffective compared to treating the combinations of them that are actually at work, he said.
Greeno said research also will help by producing more antibody therapies that either target tumors themselves or identify unhealthy cancer cells so that chemotherapy drugs can target them and spare healthy cells from their toxic effects.
"It's all of these not-very-sexy incremental improvements that we make" that are helping, he said. "And some of it frankly is learning not to use some things when we shouldn't, too."

How come only the royals can step back from their duties?

Texto completo: Can commoners ditch their duties, too — from the laundry, grocery shopping, work deadlines, making nice with the extended family?
Asking for a friend.
To recap the #Megxit drama: Harry, Meghan, and baby Archie went on the lam after announcing Wednesday that they were going to “step back" from royal duties. Meghan's grandmother-in-law (a.k.a. Queen “The Crown" Elizabeth) turned publicly passive-aggressive, and Buckingham Palace issued a statement about "complicated issues that will take time to work through."
The couple's “take-this-job-and-shove-it" moment, delivered on Instagram, tops the fed-up flight attendant of 2010 who cursed passengers over the PA system, then exited by way of the escape chute, becoming a folk hero along the way.
That guy was later arrested. And who knows? With the queen reportedly seeking a quick resolution to the scandal — maybe by now Buckingham Palace guards have rounded up the rogue royals, and Harry is in the back of a horse-drawn carriage muttering, “Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in."
But back in the real world, where access to money, celebrities, and air travel with no checked-bag fees are what people fantasize about escaping to , the royals' move has nonetheless captivated the public.
“That was the first thing I thought of — I would like to step back from my duties," said Alison Dagnes, a political science professor, the author of books on scandal, and perhaps most pertinent, the mother of two.
“They don't tell you this when you're a kid, but there's a lot to do," she said. “My students are so excited to go off into the 'real world' and I'm like, 'Don't do it!' "
In Boston, a middle-aged woman who comes from a large, contentious clan fantasized about stepping away from her familial duties and alerting her dear ones via social media, not in person.
“The beauty of it was that Meghan and Harry didn't even need to talk to the relatives," said the woman, who didn't want to be named for fear of family wrath. “They didn't have to see their tears, the anger, the threats."
Americans who have become certified royal experts by watching “The Crown" know that being a royal can be extremely boring. Dressing, dealing with protocol, giving and receiving little bows. Like you'd almost rather be in a human resources meeting about a proposed change in mileage reimbursement.
Those who have obsessively followed Meghan — who know, say, that Misha Nonoo the clothing designer, is a BFF — understand that things have not been easy for her. That what at first looked like a great role in fact carried stress beyond the pressure to appear delighted 24/7 and sit so your legs cross primly at the ankles.
As The New York Times reported, “She was too bold, too outspoken, too difficult, too American, too multicultural, the critics said. She should not have alienated the news media by refusing to join in their celebrity games. She should not have spent so much money renovating the house the royal family was kind enough to bestow upon her and her husband."
Within minutes of the young royals' announcement, media coverage reached a saturation point that even President Trump might envy, but even so, questions remain unanswered:
Are Meghan and Harry still on the Amazon Prime account? Will the queen turn their home, Frogmore Cottage, into a gym? How will Kate and Will explain this to George, Charlotte, and Louis (when he's older)?
(Suggested consumer story for British papers: “How to talk to the heirs about their uncle and aunt stepping back from their duties.")
How long have M & H been plotting this? They haven't even been married for that long. But the Daily Mail is reporting that the couple trademarked over 100 items, from hoodies to socks “SIX MONTHS before they split with the monarchy."
In many ways, this royal diss is so far removed from commoners' lives it's hard to relate to.
Most people who leave the family business don't have their wax likenesses removed from London's Madame Tussauds museum, for example.
But wax or not, they are subject to the same laws of human emotion as the rest of us, said Sherry Kuehl, author of the “Snarky in the Suburbs" books.
“Take 'royal' out of it and they're just a family," she said. “There are going to be chasms in that relationship that will never be healed. I think they're going to be lonely."
Perhaps, but at least they'll have gotten out of all those duties.

Texto completo: Brad Pitt took home the award for best supporting actor at the National Board of Review Annual Awards Gala on Wednesday night and dedicated part of his acceptance speech to Bradley Cooper.
At the awards show, Cooper presented the "Once Upon a Time in Hollywood" star with his latest honor.
"Thank you, Bradley. Bradley just put his daughter to bed and then rushed over to do this. He's a sweetheart. " Pitt said. "I got sober because of this guy, and every day’s been happier ever since. I love you, and I thank you. "
The 56-year-old movie star has been open about his struggles with sobriety before.
In an interview with The New York Times last year, Pitt revealed he spent over a year in Alcoholic's Anonymous following his split from Angelina Jolie in 2016. He spoke about a particularly cathartic experience that contributed to his health and success this year, when he quit drinking and began going to Alcoholics Anonymous meetings.
"I had taken things as far as I could take it, so I removed my drinking privileges," he said, before praising his AA group, which was comprised solely of men. “You had all these men sitting around being open and honest in a way I have never heard. It was this safe space where there was little judgment, and therefore little judgment of yourself. "

Cooper has also struggled with addiction, telling The Hollywood Reporter in 2012 that he gave it all up at 29.
"I don't drink or do drugs at all anymore," the "Hangover" star said. "Being sober helps a great deal. "
Just days prior, Pitt also took home a Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actor for his role in "Once Upon a Time in Hollywood," where he also gave a memorable speech this time mocking his co-star Leonardo DiCaprio.
"He's an all-star, he's a gent. … Still, I would've shared the raft," he joked, referencing DiCaprio's 1997 film "Titanic. "

Texto completo: Back when they were primary foes, Sen. Marco Rubio suggested Donald Trump wasnt up to the challenge of commanding the worlds most powerful military. He asserted foreign adversaries like Iran would take advantage of Trumps perceived ignorance on world affairs.

Trump, Rubio said in 2016, is not ready for the test.

He doesnt know anything about policy, Rubio said.

But the Jan. 3 U.S. strike against Iranian general Qasem Soleimani is the latest example of how much Rubios opinion of Trump has flipped since those remarks. Rubio, who once said Trump was too dangerous to possess the nuclear codes, applauded Trumps tremendous restraint on Iran  right after the president gave the go-ahead for the attack at Baghdads international airport.

Rubio, in 16, said Trump was an embarrassment. Now, those who blame Trump for escalating tension with Iran have anti-

Trump derangement syndrome, Rubio wrote on Twitter. On television and via social media, few have come to Trumps defense in the past week with as much fervor as Rubio.

Within hours of Irans retaliatory missile strike aimed at U.S. troops in Iraq on Tuesday night, Rubio tweeted: I am very confident (Trump) will pursue an appropriate response & act at a time of our choosing.

Rubio was not available for an interview, his office told the Tampa Bay Times. Asked to explain Rubios prior statements about Trump, a spokesman noted Trump is now entering his fourth year in office. The spokesman pointed to a New York Times story on Rubios growing influence in Trumps global strategy, especially in the South America. The article highlighted how Rubio worked with Vice President Mike Pence to earn Trumps trust on these matters.

Rubios about-face on Trump doesnt reflect a change in the president  who the Florida Republican predicted would fail to earn the worlds respect. Trump remains who he was in the campaign: unpredictable, dismissive of allies and experts, and instinctual.

Nevertheless, Rubio continues to find his hawkish worldview overlapping with the Trump administrations approach to foreign policy. Rubio ran for president promising to strengthen the U.S. military and use American power to oppose any violations of international waters, airspace, cyberspace, or outer space.

From Venezuela and Cuba to China and now Iran, Trump repeatedly has taken action that has won over his former Republican rival. For a while, Republicans in Florida and Washington speculated that Rubio could be positioning himself to succeed Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. However, that speculation has taken a break for now. Multiple media outlets have reported this week that Pompeo will remain in Trumps Cabinet and not seek a Kansas seat in the Senate.

So Rubio remains in the Senate. Its there, from his vantage on the Foreign Relations and Intelligence committees, that Rubio has long urged the United States to take a stronger position against Iran. He was a vocal critic of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal that was reached under President Barack Obama. It included the European Union and the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, but Trump had the U.S. abandon the deal last year. After the Jan. 3 attack, the future of the deal is in doubt.

But unlike Trumps maneuverings to cut off the Castro regime or inflict more economic harm on China, the latest escalation in the Middle East has pushed the United States to the brink of a protracted military campaign against Iran, if not an all-out-war. The action has led many 2020 Democratic hopefuls to echo some of the concerns that Rubio once espoused about a Trump administration.

Former Vice President Joe Biden said that Trump relied on a haphazard decision-making process. Sen. Bernie Sanders said the president acted impulsively without explanation.

Were not here by accident, Sen. Elizabeth Warren tweeted. Were here because a reckless president.

Other Florida Democrats have questioned whether Trump has a plan for whats next.

This reckless and destabilizing strike puts Americans and our allies at risk, U.S. Rep. Val Demings, an Orlando Democrat said. Did we confer with our allies in the region? What is the administrations overall strategic plan since deliberately undermining the Iran nuclear deal?

Rubio has responded harshly to these criticisms, insisting Iran is the bad actor and the instigator. On Sundays episode of CBS Face the Nation, Rubio said Trumps strategy is clear to him.

Its self-defense, Rubio said, alluding to the administrations insistence that an attack from Soleimani was imminent. He couldnt, however, discuss how he knew that because its highly sensitive. It cannot be disclosed at this time without also putting a danger.

Rubio has said that what happens next is up to Iran, leading to an uncertain future.

Do you believe now that America is safer after carrying out the strike against Qasem Soleimani? Face the Nation host Margaret Brennan asked.

Rubios response was typical of him: A prolonged, seemingly effortless monologue that displayed a command of foreign affairs.

One word it didnt include? Yes.

Texto completo: Former Vice President Joe Biden has continued to recast what advice he gave President Barack Obama about whether to raid the compound that was the suspected hideaway for Osama bin Laden.
Biden’s latest statement occurred during a brief exchange with Fox News reporter Peter Doocy in Iowa on Jan. 3, following President Donald Trump’s order to kill Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani.
Doocy: “As commander in chief, if you were ever handed a piece of intelligence that said you can stop an imminent attack on Americans but you have to use an airstrike to take out a terror leader, would you pull the trigger?”
Biden: “Well, we did. Guy’s name was Osama bin Laden.”
Doocy: “Didn’t you tell President Obama not to go after bin Laden?”
Biden: “No, I didn’t. I didn’t.”
It is a challenge to fact-check what Biden told Obama in advance of the May 2011 raid to kill bin Laden, because their conversations were largely private. However, Biden has made conflicting statements about what he told Obama.
In 2012, Biden said he told Obama “don’t go” and called for him to take additional steps to confirm bin Laden was at the compound. But in 2015, Biden said he told Obama “go.”
In 2012 Biden said he told Obama not to launch raid on compound
In January 2012 at a Democratic congressional retreat, Biden recounted how Obama asked senior officials whether they should go ahead with the raid. Everyone in the room “hedged their bet” except CIA Director Leon Panetta, who said “go.”
“Mr. President, my suggestion is, don’t go,” Biden recounted. “‘We have to do two more things to see if he’s there.”
In May 2012 on NBC’s Meet the Press, Biden said he told Obama “follow your instincts.”
Obama’s statement during a debate in 2012 supported the idea that Biden was critical about the raid proposal. Obama said that “ even some in my own party, including my current vice president,” critiqued the proposed raid.
Biden later said he told Obama to go ahead with the raid
By 2013, Biden started to recast his account of what he told Obama. The New York Times magazine wrote that Biden had advised against the 2011 raid on the house in Pakistan that was suspected to be bin Laden’s hideaway.
But the quote by Biden was more vague: “I remember walking up to his office and saying, ‘Look, follow your instincts, follow your instincts.’”
In 2015, Biden said he did tell Obama privately to go after bin Laden.
On Oct. 20, 2015, at an event honoring former Vice President Walter Mondale, Biden said when Obama asked everyone in the room whether he should go forward, only two were definitive: Panetta said “go” and Secretary of Defense Robert Gates said “don’t go.”
Biden said he told Obama in a private conversation, “I thought he should go but to follow his own instincts.”
That led to multiple news reports showing that Biden had revised his account from 2012 when he said he told Obama “don’t go.”
Days later, CBS journalist Norah O’Donnell asked Biden to clear up the confusion about whether he told Obama to conduct the raid.
“Everything I said was completely accurate. I just never until last Tuesday night told the whole story,” he said, referring to the Mondale event.
Biden continued: “Immediately, we got up, as we always do, and I walked out with the president. We walked up to the Oval. I said, ‘Mr. President, follow your instincts. I know you should do it, but follow your instincts.’ “
Obama-era officials said Biden expressed skepticism
Biden’s claim that he told Obama to “go” conflicted with other accounts from Obama-era officials in their books.
Obama’s Secretary of State Hillary Clinton wrote in “Hard Choices” that Biden “remained skeptical.”
Panetta wrote in “Worthy Fights” that Biden “argued that we still did not have enough confidence that bin Laden was in the compound, and he came out firmly in favor of waiting for more information.”
Defense Secretary Robert Gates wrote in “Duty: Memoirs of a Secretary at War” that he and Biden were the “two primary skeptics.”
“Biden’s primary concern was the political consequences of failure,” Gates wrote.
Our ruling
When Doocy asked Biden “Didn’t you tell President Obama not to go after bin Laden?” Biden replied “No, I didn’t. I didn’t.”
Biden’s answer to Doocy is hardly the full story and misses critical context. We rate his statement Mostly False.

Church forced to learn to fight back Deadly plot against Ga. congregation uncovered in time

Texto completo: GAINESVILLE, Ga. - The tiny white church has new locks, peepholes and brass plates. While its parishioners pray, the sanctuary is bolted shut and a police officer is now stationed outside. Soon, surveillance cameras will be installed, and the 47-member congregation will participate in active-shooter training.
This is the next chapter for the Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church, which the authorities said was targeted in mid-November. Gainesville police charged a 16-year-old white girl with planning a racially motivated knife attack to kill the black worshippers, a plot they said bore eerie similarity to a 2015 massacre at a storied African American church in Charleston, South Carolina.
In Gainesville, a small city of 40,000 residents in the heart of Georgia's poultry industry, the police chief has urged church members to use low-tech force to protect themselves. They should hurl Bibles or hot coffee, chairs or fire extinguishers, anything, he said, that can be weaponized if they are under attack and cannot safely escape.
"It's a shame that we live in a world today where we have to protect our institutions of worship, our schools, but evil knows where we are most vulnerable," Chief Jay Parrish told church leaders during a recent introduction to the active-shooter training. "The lightning bolt got too close this time."
Faced with a rise in attacks on houses of worship, the Rev. Michelle Rizer-Pool, the pastor of Bethel, and other religious leaders across the country are fortifying their buildings and preparing for the possibility of mass shootings. Some have also turned to armed security and organized law enforcement patrols.
Last week, a gunman opened fire during Sunday service at a Texas church, killing two congregants before an armed member of the church's volunteer security team fatally shot him. And over the past two years, gunmen have targeted worshippers at synagogues in Poway, California, where one person died, and in Pittsburgh, where a man shouting anti-Semitic slurs gunned down 11 people, and at a Baptist church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, where 26 people were killed and 20 more were wounded.
"Unfortunately, this is what it has come to. We have to be ready to fight back," said Rizer-Pool, a retired Army major who has led Bethel for about 18 months. "We are having to get our arms around this idea of praying and praising our God in what is supposed to be a place of peace, but having to be watchful and on the lookout."
Faith groups have responded to the growing threat of hate crimes and violence, in part, by offering specialized training and producing safety guides. The Council on American-Islamic Relations published a safety manual for religious institutions and began holding training sessions after a mass shooting at a Sikh temple in Wisconsin in 2012.
"Our thinking is, if you substitute 'mosque' for 'church' or 'synagogue' or 'temple,' the concerns are the same, so we made the guide available to the entire faith community," said Ibrahim Hooper, national communications director for the group.
After a gunman stormed the small church in Sutherland Springs in November 2017, a Dallas-area megachurch organized an active-shooter training session, which more than 600 church leaders from across the country attended. Since then, the church and the Southern Baptists of Texas Convention have provided training and security assessments at 150 churches in Texas, Oregon and Missouri. Texas legislators responded, too, by passing laws that allow anyone with a concealed-carry license to bring firearms into churches.
In Gainesville, 55 miles northeast of Atlanta, the police department has conducted training and security assessments across the city since a gunman stormed an elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut, and killed 26 people, including 20 children, in 2012.
At Bethel on one recent dreary Saturday morning, after the hymn, the prayer and the scripture reading, Parrish and Sgt. Kevin Holbrook talked to the church's leadership about fear - and fighting back. They had gathered in a backroom to discuss the creation of a security team and response plan to protect the congregation.
The new reality, the police officers said, calls for adding a layer of vigilance to the church's general culture and spirit of inclusion. Now, parishioners need to know alternate exits. They need to make eye contact with visitors. They need to set up patrol details.
But the most important strategy, the officers said, is knowing how to react if attacked: Run, hide or fight. Run to safety; hide from the attacker; or, as a last resort, fight back with anything available.
"A fire extinguisher makes a huge cloud, and if it gets on your skin, it burns. If it gets in your eyes, it blinds. And if you get hit in the head with it, it will knock you out," Parrish said. "If you have to fight, know you're fighting for your life."
The Gainesville High School student arrested a few weeks before this training session was on a mission to kill Bethel church members, the authorities said. In a carefully orchestrated plan, they said, the teenage girl acquired butcher knives, researched online, took meticulous notes and had scouted the church's location on Mill Street.
On the day she went to the church - either to launch the attack or to collect more information, the police said - she found an empty building. Authorities said the girl's plan was likely inspired by Dylann Roof, the convicted white supremacist who murdered nine worshippers during Bible study at a church of the same denomination, Emanuel AME, in Charleston, South Carolina.
The Gainesville plot was foiled by classmates who told a high school counselor about the girl's notebook, which contained the chilling plans. Police said the level of detail in her notes may have saved Bethel.
The student, who has not been identified by the authorities, was charged with criminal intent to commit murder.
Though police said her plan was racially motivated, she was not charged with a hate crime because the state is one of four across the country with no such law. But after the planned attack was made public, a group of black legislators announced that they would continue to push for a bill to create stiffer penalties for crimes motivated by hate.

Facebook to Keep Targeted Political Ads but Give Users More Control; The social-media giant breaks with other tech firms, says regulators—not companies—should rule on political ads

Texto completo: In a break with other tech companies, Facebook Inc. said it wouldn't limit how political advertising targets potential voters, but would instead give users tools to see fewer of those ads on its platforms.
Facebook's stance—that companies shouldn't decide how campaigns are able to reach voters—is at odds with other tech firms' approach to handling political advertising in the run-up to the 2020 election.
Operators of online platforms are under increasing pressure to curb the spread of misleading or false information in the wake of the 2016 presidential campaign, which U.S. intelligence agencies have said was subject to foreign meddling online.
Facebook's announcement Thursday highlighted the divide in opinion on what the company's role should be in elections, as critics—including some Democratic presidential candidates—said the latest decision leaves the door wide open for disinformation.
Share Your Thoughts
What limits to political ads would you want to put on your own Facebook account, if any? Join the conversation below.
Facebook has acknowledged that the spread of disinformation, including through targeted ads, is a problem and has expressed a desire for federal regulation of political advertising online. But its announcement in September that it would exempt politicians' and certain other ads from its third-party fact-checking program fed skepticism about its commitment to combating disinformation on its platform.
The company based its latest decision "on the principle that people should be able to hear from those who wish to lead them, warts and all, and that what they say should be scrutinized and debated in public," according to a blog post from Rob Leathern, Facebook's director of product management. "This does not mean that politicians can say whatever they like in advertisements on Facebook."
The post said all Facebook users have to follow its community standards, which ban hate speech, harmful content and content designed to intimidate voters or stop them from exercising their right to vote.
The company's announcement Thursday also included changes that Facebook said will boost transparency in its ad library relating to how political advertisers deploy their messages on its platforms.
Facebook's approach, including giving users more control over what they see, contrasts with moves by Twitter Inc. and Alphabet Inc.'s Google.
Google earlier this week launched its new policy globally barring advertisers from targeting political messages based on users' interests inferred from their browsing or search histories, among other changes. Twitter stopped accepting most political ads in November.
Facebook acknowledged it considered restricting targeting but ultimately chose not to do so.
The Wall Street Journal previously reported Facebook was weighing, among other steps, raising the minimum number of people who can be targeted in political ads on its platform from 100 to a few thousand. The practice known as microtargeting has been criticized for enabling political actors to single out groups for misleading or false ads that aren't exposed to broader public scrutiny.
Facebook said its data showed more than 85% of ad spending by U.S. presidential candidates is for messages aimed at an audience of more than 250,000 people.
The social-media giant said it consulted with a number of nonprofits, political groups and election campaigns—both Democratic and Republican—before reaching its decision.
"Ultimately, we don't think decisions about political ads should be made by private companies, which is why we are arguing for regulation that would apply across the industry," Mr. Leathern said, echoing comments Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg has made about the need for federal regulation of political advertising.
Reaction to Facebook's latest decision again showed divergent opinions on how the company should treat political ads.
Trump campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh said Facebook's decision not to limit targeting allows more Americans to be involved in politics. In any case, he said, there is no escaping political messaging.
"If users do elect to see fewer political ads it still won't stop them from being bombarded by ads from the news media, which are biased and just as political, because there's a loophole in the rule for the media," Mr. Murtaugh said.
Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D., Minn.) criticized Facebook's decision. "Facebook is doubling down on a policy that hurts our democracy," the presidential candidate said in a statement that reiterated her call for comprehensive federal rules on digital political ads.
The campaign of Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden also was critical of the company. "Today's announcement is more window dressing around their decision to allow paid misinformation," said campaign spokesman Bill Russo.
Tara McGowan, chief executive of Acronym, a progressive nonprofit that tracks political-ad spending among other work, said she largely agreed with Facebook's move to not limit political targeting but hopes the company does more to rein in misinformation and hate speech.
Roughly $3 billion is expected to be spent on political advertising online for the 2020 U.S. election. But with Election Day less than a year away, a lack of uniform rules for the ads has led to confusion about exactly what is allowed on digital platforms, how intensely new policies will be enforced and whether advertising strategies and budgets will need to change further.
Watchdogs, including lawmakers and advocacy groups, have called for greater oversight of political advertising following revelations that Russian entities purchased digital ads designed to influence the 2016 presidential election.
Facebook's announcement comes two days after the New York Times reported on an internal post by Facebook executive Andrew Bosworth, in which he said he believed the platform played a central role in the 2016 presidential election.
"So was Facebook responsible for Donald Trump getting elected? I think the answer is yes, but not for the reasons anyone thinks. He didn't get elected because of Russia or misinformation or Cambridge Analytica. He got elected because he ran the single best digital ad campaign I've ever seen from any advertiser. Period," Mr. Bosworth wrote.
Facebook said seeing fewer political and social-issue ads was a common request from users and that it aims to roll out its new user-control feature in the U.S. early this summer on its main platform and on Instagram. It will later expand to other locations. Other features aimed at increasing ad transparency will launch in the current quarter.
Facebook said while its users have been able to hide all messages from a specific advertiser in their ad preferences, they soon will be able to stop seeing ads based on how an advertiser constructed its list of targeted users.
In addition, users will be able to opt in to see messages that are directed at a group that didn't automatically include them.
Efforts to block political advertising likely wouldn't have a large impact on Facebook's top line. In October Mr. Zuckerberg said on an earnings call he estimated political ads would account for less than 0.5% of the company's total revenue in 2020.

Texto completo: I have spent the last 20 or so New Years' Eves glued to the SyFy Channel's "Twilight Zone" marathon. My wife and I love the writing, the plots and picking out famous actors in their one-off roles for the classic television series.
Maybe I'll write an episode of my own, complete with a Rod Serling-worthy opening monologue:
"The year is 2017. Donald Trump is inaugurated as president of the United States, and mass amnesia has washed over America. Half the country can no longer remember anything that happened before Jan. 20. The former president, Barack Obama, is literally sitting right there. Yet, his own party cannot remember one thing about his eight years ..."
It is one of the strangest phenomena of the Trump era – the memory-holing of Obama's executive powers. Democrats continuously act as though they've just fallen off the Washington turnip wagon when Trump does anything.
Trump's illegal immigration policies are draconian! He's deporting too many, they screamed, forgetting that Obama deported more. A lot more. And, you know those cages on the southern border? Obama built them, not Trump.
Trump's defying congressional subpoenas! No president has ever stonewalled Congress, they screamed, forgetting that Obama's attorney general, Eric Holder, was held in contempt of Congress for ... defying subpoenas related to the Fast and Furious scandal. There were at least eight other times when Obama's administration defied congressional oversight, even preventing people from testifying (sound familiar?).
When Trump announced his "America First" policy during his inaugural, Democrats apparently took it as literally as one can.
Now, they howl over Trump's latest outrage: the airstrike that killed Iranian terrorist Qassem Soleimani, who was in Iraq fomenting attacks against the American embassy and, evidently, plotting future hits on American targets.
Washington Democrats whined about Trump authorizing a drone strike without their notification or consent. This, after Obama authorized at least 2,800 drone strikes in Iraq and Syria without congressional approval.
"When Obama accepted the Nobel Peace Prize in December 2009, he had authorized more drone strikes than George W. Bush had approved during his entire presidency. By his third year in office, Obama had approved the killings of twice as many suspected terrorists as had ever been imprisoned in Guantánamo Bay," Newsweek reported.
Obama practically invented modern push-button warfare, for goodness' sake! Eventually, the American people will have to choose between partisan disingenuousness or rank stupidity to explain Democratic reaction to Trump's perfectly precedented decisions.
On Iran, Trump made a bold choice and sent a strong message that we aren't going to take the regime's provocations and hostility anymore. Obama sent them pallets of cash. Trump sent an MQ-9 Reaper.
Anyone who knows how this will all shake out is lying. They don't. But the commander in chief took out the world's most notorious terrorist, one with plenty of American blood on his hands. Trump is the good guy here, not the terrorist.
Yet, Democrats couldn't wait to pounce. How many statements included perfunctory "yeah, Soleimani was a bad guy, but ..." construction before hammering Trump?
Here's a pro-tip: If your statement has a "but" in the middle (I'm looking at you, Elizabeth Warren), just eliminate the throat-clearing, political pablum that came before it and say what you really mean. We get it. Iranian Guy Bad, Orange Man Worse.
This attitude will cost Democrats in the upcoming election. Not just on foreign policy, but across the board (they speak of the economy as though we are in another Great Depression). They just can't give Trump an inch no matter how safe or prosperous the world is, thanks at least in part to the president's decisions.
It hasn't always been this way. After the death of Osama bin Laden, Republicans praised Obama's decision to get him.
"Former Vice President Dick Cheney declared, 'The administration clearly deserves credit for the success of the operation.' New York's former mayor, Rudolph W. Giuliani, said, 'I admire the courage of the president.' And Donald J. Trump declared, 'I want to personally congratulate President Obama,'" according to the New York Times.
But no such allowance is given to President Trump, when he kills a terrorist. As commentator Guy Benson tweeted, "The US auto industry is alive, and Baghdadi/Soleimani are dead," referencing the ISIS leader Trump had killed a few months ago and recalling Obama's reelection slogan.
Or, as Mr. Serling might say, "Democrats will soon wake up from their amnesia to an old lesson: Past is prologue. And it's a Shakespearean seminar most acutely taken ... in The Twilight Zone."

Texto completo: 'The Selected Letters of Ralph Ellison'
Edited by John F. Callahan and Marc C. Conner, Random House, 1,060 pages, $50.
"You are hereby warned," Ralph Ellison wrote to his friend Albert Murray in 1951, "that I have dropped the shuck."
After years of struggle and doubt, Ellison had finished "Invisible Man," his epic of midcentury African American life. The novel would win the National Book Award. His life was about to change.
An essential new book, "The Selected Letters of Ralph Ellison," presents this writer in all his candor, seriousness, outrage and wit. Nearly all of these letters are previously unpublished. What brings them alive is that while they brood on the largest of issues -- identity, alienation, the political responsibilities of the artist -- they're earthy and squirming with all the vital things of everyday experience.
You move from the cascade of Ellison's thinking about art and ideas, for example, to one of the funniest and warmest letters I've ever read. It too is to Murray, the influential critic; these two men found something deeply congenial in each other.
It's about the problem of finding the ingredients Ellison needs to cook pigs' trotters while a fellow at the American Academy in Rome in 1956. He misses home cooking amid all the highbrow pasta.
He prepares them anyway, "but they weren't right, man. They were the saddest and I threw most of mine in the garbage."
Ellison (1913-1994) was born in Oklahoma City, the grandson of slaves. His father delivered ice and coal. He died when Ellison was 3, and his mother worked odd jobs to hold the family together.
Ellison attended Tuskegee University in Alabama as a music major, and his letters home were typical collegiate ones: He tended to need money or a new pair of pants. He played the trumpet and thought he might become a composer.
Ellison moved to Harlem in 1936 and fell in with a bohemian crowd that included the writers Langston Hughes and Richard Wright. (In this book's later letters, Ellison works to disentangle his legacy from Wright's.) He began writing "Invisible Man" at a friend's farm in Vermont.
Ellison's Vermont letters could be a little book of their own.
"When the poison of Harlem mixes with this pure mountain air anything's apt to come out of my typewriter," he wrote. In another letter he wrote that birch trees "show like girls in light summer dresses."
In Vermont he was often without a car, miles from a grocery store, and he begged friends to send items such as coffee and sharp cheese. Ellison suffered throughout his life from what appears to be irritable bowel syndrome, and many letters lay bare his gastric distress.
He wrote with ardor about the literary process.
To Wright, he said: "It isn't the prose, per se, that worries me; it's the form, the learning how to organize my material in order to take the maximum advantage of those psychological and emotional currents within myself and in the reader which endow prose with meaning." He added: "It's an uncertain battle on a dark terrain."
To the literary critic Kenneth Burke, he wrote: "Let me ask you a question: How will a Negro writer who writes out of his full awareness of the complexity of western personality, and who presents the violence of American culture in psychological terms rather than physical ones -- how will such a writer be able to break though the stereotype-armored minds of white Americans so that they can receive his message?"
"Invisible Man" found so many white readers that, in a later letter, Ellison thanked Murray for turning more black readers onto it.
The great question that hangs over Ellison's career is why didn't he publish a second novel during his lifetime? ("Juneteenth," finally issued in 1999, was a 368-page condensation of a much longer manuscript written over 40 years.)
These letters offer more than a few clues. Fame struck Ellison like lightning after the publication of "Invisible Man." He was invited everywhere to speak and mostly accepted. A single letter from 1957 mentions Rome, Karachi, Tehran and Hong Kong.
He recalls adventures in Rome with John Cheever in Cheever's Fiat. He attended Robert Penn Warren's black-tie parties. He lived for a while in Saul Bellow's upstate New York house. He drank and argued with Norman Mailer and Dwight Macdonald.
Ellison taught at Bard, New York University and elsewhere. He wrote essays, many of them about music. After a while, lines like this one, from a 1958 letter to Bellow, begin to crop up: "I've got a natural writer's block as big as the Ritz and as stubborn as a grease spot on a gabardine suit."
This collection has so many incidental pleasures that I nearly always felt lucky to be reading it while the rest of the world had to make do with Twitter. He writes about his love of hunting, his anxiety over going bald, how to cope with aggressive cats. (To Bellow: "I know about dogs; but how, pray, does one kick a cat's ass?") There's a sorrowful letter about pulling porcupine quills from his beloved dog's snout.
His writing about music is nearly always sublime.
"Bessie Smith singing a good blues may deal with experience as profoundly as Eliot," he wrote.
About Herman Melville: "Been rereading 'Moby-Dick' again and appreciating for the first time what a truly good time Melville was having when he wrote it. Some of it is quite funny and all of it is pervaded by the spirit of play, like real jazz sounds when a master is manipulating it."

Church forced to learn to fight back [Corrected 01/10/2020]

Texto completo: The tiny white church has new locks, peepholes and brass plates. While its parishioners pray, the sanctuary is bolted shut and a police officer is now stationed outside. Soon, surveillance cameras will be installed, and the 47-member congregation will participate in active-shooter training.
This is the next chapter for the Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church, which the authorities said was targeted in mid-November. Gainesville police charged a 16-year-old white girl with planning a racially motivated knife attack to kill the black worshippers, a plot they said bore eerie similarity to a 2015 massacre at a storied African American church in Charleston, South Carolina.
In Gainesville, a small city of 40,000 residents in the heart of Georgia's poultry industry, the police chief has urged church members to use low-tech force to protect themselves. They should hurl Bibles or hot coffee, chairs or fire extinguishers, anything, he said, that can be weaponized if they are under attack and cannot safely escape.
"It's a shame that we live in a world today where we have to protect our institutions of worship, our schools, but evil knows where we are most vulnerable," Chief Jay Parrish told church leaders during a recent introduction to the active-shooter training. "The lightning bolt got too close this time."
Faced with a rise in attacks on houses of worship, the Rev. Michelle Rizer-Pool, the pastor of Bethel, and other religious leaders across the country are fortifying their buildings and preparing for the possibility of mass shootings. Some have also turned to armed security and organized law enforcement patrols.
Last week, a gunman opened fire during Sunday service at a Texas church, killing two congregants before an armed member of the church's volunteer security team fatally shot him. And over the past two years, gunmen have targeted worshippers at synagogues in Poway, California, where one person died, and in Pittsburgh, where a man shouting anti-Semitic slurs gunned down 11 people, and at a Baptist church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, where 26 people were killed and 20 more were wounded.
"Unfortunately, this is what it has come to. We have to be ready to fight back," said Rizer-Pool, a retired Army major who has led Bethel for about 18 months. "We are having to get our arms around this idea of praying and praising our God in what is supposed to be a place of peace, but having to be watchful and on the lookout."
Faith groups have responded to the growing threat of hate crimes and violence, in part, by offering specialized training and producing safety guides. The Council on American-Islamic Relations published a safety manual for religious institutions and began holding training sessions after a mass shooting at a Sikh temple in Wisconsin in 2012.
"Our thinking is, if you substitute 'mosque' for 'church' or 'synagogue' or 'temple,' the concerns are the same, so we made the guide available to the entire faith community," said Ibrahim Hooper, national communications director for the group.
After a gunman stormed the small church in Sutherland Springs in November 2017, a Dallas-area megachurch organized an active-shooter training session, which more than 600 church leaders from across the country attended. Since then, the church and the Southern Baptists of Texas Convention have provided training and security assessments at 150 churches in Texas, Oregon and Missouri. Texas legislators responded, too, by passing laws that allow anyone with a concealed-carry license to bring firearms into churches.
In Gainesville, 55 miles northeast of Atlanta, the police department has conducted training and security assessments across the city since a gunman stormed an elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut, and killed 26 people, including 20 children, in 2012.
At Bethel on one recent dreary Saturday morning, after the hymn, the prayer and the scripture reading, Parrish and Sgt. Kevin Holbrook talked to the church's leadership about fear -- and fighting back. They had gathered in a backroom to discuss the creation of a security team and response plan to protect the congregation.
The new reality, the police officers said, calls for adding a layer of vigilance to the church's general culture and spirit of inclusion. Now, parishioners need to know alternate exits. They need to make eye contact with visitors. They need to set up patrol details.
But the most important strategy, the officers said, is knowing how to react if attacked: Run, hide or fight. Run to safety; hide from the attacker; or, as a last resort, fight back with anything available.
"A fire extinguisher makes a huge cloud, and if it gets on your skin, it burns. If it gets in your eyes, it blinds. And if you get hit in the head with it, it will knock you out," Parrish said. "If you have to fight, know you're fighting for your life."
The Gainesville High School student arrested a few weeks before this training session was on a mission to kill Bethel church members, the authorities said. In a carefully orchestrated plan, they said, the teenage girl acquired butcher knives, researched online, took meticulous notes and had scouted the church's location on Mill Street.
On the day she went to the church -- either to launch the attack or to collect more information, the police said -- she found an empty building. Authorities said the girl's plan was likely inspired by Dylann Roof, the convicted white supremacist who murdered nine worshippers during Bible study at a church of the same denomination, Emanuel AME, in Charleston, South Carolina.
The Gainesville plot was foiled by classmates who told a high school counselor about the girl's notebook, which contained the chilling plans. Police said the level of detail in her notes may have saved Bethel.
The student, who has not been identified by the authorities, was charged with criminal intent to commit murder.
Though police said her plan was racially motivated, she was not charged with a hate crime because the state is one of four across the country with no such law. But after the planned attack was made public, a group of black legislators announced that they would continue to push for a bill to create stiffer penalties for crimes motivated by hate.

Texto completo: Elizabeth Wurtzel, whose startling 1994 memoir, "Prozac Nation: Young and Depressed in America," won praise for opening a dialogue about clinical depression and helped introduce an unsparing style of confessional writing that remains influential, died Tuesday in New York City. She was 52.
Writer David Samuels, a friend since childhood, said the cause was metastatic breast cancer, a disease that resulted from the BRCA genetic mutation. Wurtzel had a double mastectomy in 2015. After her diagnosis, she became an advocate for BRCA testing -- something she had not had -- and wrote about her cancer experience in The New York Times.
"I could have had a mastectomy with reconstruction and skipped the part where I got cancer," she wrote. "I feel like the biggest idiot for not doing so."
Writing about her final illness was a natural choice for Wurtzel, who had for a quarter-century scrutinized her life in relentless detail, becoming a hero to some, especially to many women of her generation and younger, but also drawing scorn. "Prozac Nation," her first book, published when she was 27, was unvarnished in its accounts of her student days at Harvard University, her drug use, her extensive sex life and more.
It divided critics.
"Wurtzel's nation is a nation of one," Karen Schoemer wrote in a dismissive review in Newsweek. "She makes only tenuous attempts to draw parallels between herself and her generation, and she randomly blames her parents, her therapists, her friends, the divorce rate, drugs and the times for her problems."
But Michiko Kakutani, reviewing the book in The New York Times, found more to like. She acknowledged that its self-pitying passages "make the reader want to shake the author, and remind her that there are far worse fates than growing up during the '70s in New York and going to Harvard."
"But," she added, "Ms. Wurtzel herself is hyperaware of the narcissistic nature of her problems, and her willingness to expose herself -- narcissism and all -- ultimately wins the reader over."
The book became a cultural reference point and part of a new wave of confessional writing.
Wurtzel followed her own lead with her subsequent writing, especially "More, Now, Again: A Memoir of Addiction," published in 2002. That book detailed her abuse of cocaine and of Ritalin, which she would grind up and snort.
Elizabeth Lee Wurtzel was born July 31, 1967, in Manhattan. Her mother, Lynne Ellen Winters, was married to Donald Wurtzel, and until recently Elizabeth Wurtzel had assumed that he was her father. In a 2018 essay in New York, she wrote of learning that she was actually the child of an affair between her mother and photographer Bob Adelman, who died in 2016.
She grew up on the Upper East Side and began writing "Prozac Nation" in 1986.
"It was originally a book about Harvard; it wasn't even about depression," she told the news website Vice in 1994. "But everything in it was about being depressed, so that changed it."
While earning her bachelor's degree she wrote for The Harvard Crimson and started an internship at The Dallas Morning News, but she lost that job amid accusations of plagiarism. After graduating she was able to get jobs with New York magazine and The New Yorker, writing about rock music, often in a way that invited derision. When Tina Brown took over as editor of The New Yorker in 1992, Wurtzel was one of her first cuts.
In 2015, Wurtzel married James Freed Jr., who survives her, as does her mother.

Texto completo: In a year of gut punches to Britain's royal family, Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan, delivered a jarring blow of their own Wednesday, announcing that they would "step back" from their official duties.
It was an extraordinary retreat by the popular prince and his American wife, who had grown increasingly isolated within the House of Windsor since their 2018 wedding.
In a statement, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, as they are also known, said they planned to divide their time between Britain and North America and would "work to become financially independent."
"After many months of reflection and internal discussions, we have chosen to make a transition this year to carve out a progressive new role within this institution," the couple said in a post on their Instagram account. "It is with your encouragement, particularly over the last few years, that we feel prepared to make this adjustment."
While the language in the statement was mild and upbeat, the change that Harry, 35, and Meghan, 38, his wife are embarking on is momentous. Although he is sixth in the line of succession to Queen Elizabeth II, Harry has exerted an outsize hold on the public imagination ever since his days as the mischievous younger son of Prince Charles and Princess Diana.
For the duke and duchess to forsake Britain and relinquish their royal duties, even for part of the year, will be a jolt to one of the nation's most immutable institutions.
It continues the convention-defying ways of Harry, who enthralled millions of Britons and angered others when he decided to take an American actress, with a biracial background, as his bride.
Buckingham Palace issued a terse two-line statement Wednesday evening, suggesting that the couple's announcement had caught the royal family off guard, if not totally blindsided it.
"Discussions with the Duke and Duchess of Sussex are at an early stage," the statement said. "We understand their desire to take a different approach, but these are complicated issues that will take time to work through."
Among those issues, one royal watcher said, was how a partial self-exile would work. Other members of the family have been exiled because of divorce, abdication or their own behavior. But no one has attempted the half-in, half-out arrangement that Harry and his wife appear to be pursuing.
It also raises questions about how they would support themselves, since British taxpayers fund their security, among many other expenses.
Wednesday's announcement came amid persistent rumors of tensions between Harry and Meghan and his brother, Prince William, and his wife, Kate, which have been eagerly dissected by the tabloid press in London.
In October, during a trip to South Africa, the Sussexes opened up to TV interviewer Tom Bradby. The duchess said she was struggling with being a royal and a new mother. Harry kindled rumors of a rift by saying that he and William were on "different paths at the moment."
On Wednesday, the duke and duchess said they would continue "to fully support Her Majesty the Queen" and would still support charities with which they are affiliated.
But they said they wanted to give their 8-month-old son, Prince Archie, "geographic balance" in his upbringing. Spending part of the year outside Britain, they said, would provide their family with "the space to focus on the next chapter, including the launch of our new charitable entity."
The couple did not say where in North America they planned to live, but royal watchers said they expected it to be Canada.

The couple spent several weeks during the holidays at a house in Vancouver, and the duchess -- who was raised in Los Angeles and attended Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, graduating in 2003 -- lived in Toronto for several years, where her television series, "Suits," was filmed.

Texto completo: TikTok, the smartphone app beloved by teenagers and used by hundreds of millions of people around the world, had serious vulnerabilities that would have allowed hackers to manipulate user data and reveal personal information, according to research published Wednesday by Check Point, a cybersecurity company in Israel.
The weaknesses would have allowed attackers to send TikTok users messages that carried malicious links. Once users clicked on the links, attackers would have been able to take control of their accounts, including uploading videos or gaining access to private videos. A separate flaw allowed Check Point researchers to retrieve personal information from TikTok user accounts through the company's website.
"The vulnerabilities we found were all core to TikTok's systems," said Oded Vanunu, Check Point's head of product vulnerability research.
TikTok learned about the conclusions of Check Point's research Nov. 20 and said it had fixed the vulnerabilities by Dec. 15.
The app, whose parent company is based in Beijing, allows users to post short, creative videos, which can easily be shared on various apps.
It has also become a target of lawmakers and regulators who are suspicious of Chinese technology. Several branches of the U.S. military have barred personnel from having the app on government-issued smartphones.
TikTok has exploded in popularity over the past two years, becoming a rare Chinese internet success story in the West. It has been downloaded more than 1.5 billion times, according to the data firm Sensor Tower.
But new apps like TikTok offer opportunities for hackers looking to target services that haven't been tested through years of security research and real-world attacks. And many of its users are young and perhaps not mindful of security updates.
"TikTok is committed to protecting user data," said Luke Deshotels, the head of TikTok's security team.
One vulnerability allowed attackers to use a link in TikTok's messaging system to send users messages that appeared to come from TikTok. The Check Point researchers tested the weakness by sending themselves links with malware that let them take control of accounts, uploading content, deleting videos and making private videos public.
The researchers also found that TikTok's site was vulnerable to a type of attack that injects malicious code into websites. Check Point researchers were able to retrieve users' personal information.
Deshotels said there was no indication in customer records that a breach or an attack had occurred.
TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, is one of the world's most valuable tech startups. But TikTok's popularity and its roots in China, where no large corporation can thrive outside the good graces of the government, have prompted intense scrutiny of the app's content policies and data practices.

McConnell rebuffs Pelosi on impeachment trial terms [Corrected 01/10/2020]

Texto completo: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell flatly refused Wednesday to negotiate with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on the terms of the Senate's impeachment trial of President Donald Trump and accused the speaker of playing politics with a solemn process at a time of possible war.
A day after he announced that he had the votes to conduct a trial without agreeing to Democrats' demands for witnesses, McConnell said the House had no choice now but to end "shameless game-playing" and transmit the two articles of impeachment against Trump that it approved last month.
"There will be no haggling with the House over Senate procedure," McConnell, R-Ky., said on the Senate floor. "We will not cede our authority to try this impeachment. The House's turn is over. The Senate has made its decision."
Pelosi, D-Calif., has been withholding the charges in a bid to help Democrats press their case that any fair trial must include the guarantee of new witnesses and documents. On Tuesday evening in a letter to House colleagues, she demanded that McConnell make public his proposed rules for the proceeding before she delivered the articles so that Democrats could "see the arena in which we will be participating."
But McConnell appeared in no rush to do so. Citing the heightened tensions in the Middle East -- where Iran fired missiles at U.S. forces in Iraq early Wednesday -- the Senate leader charged that the speaker was playing a dangerous game on impeachment at the worst possible time.
"At the very same time a global crisis was unfolding in real time, she published another 'Dear colleague' letter saying she intends to keep our commander in chief in this limbo indefinitely," McConnell said.
McConnell's objective in the current battle is to bring about a speedy acquittal of the president, belittling the House's case in the process.
Pelosi, having carefully orchestrated the impeachment vote in the House, does not want to allow the Senate to quickly bury the matter without delving into additional witness accounts or documents.
And if she cannot force McConnell to agree to those terms, she is determined at least to convince the public that the Senate trial is illegitimate -- and, by extension, that Trump's acquittal was rigged from the start.
The latest comments from McConnell came in response to a letter from Pelosi to House colleagues late Tuesday in which she accused the Senate leader of putting his loyalty to the president above the Constitution.
The impeachment charges stem from a House inquiry that concluded Trump pressured Ukraine to investigate his political rivals in a bid to boost his reelection campaign and then sought to conceal his actions from legislative oversight.
On Wednesday, McConnell reiterated that he intends to follow the model of President Bill Clinton's 1999 impeachment trial, delaying any consideration of additional witnesses or evidence not included in the House inquiry until opening arguments are complete and senators have a chance to question the prosecution and defense.
Although at least three Senate Republicans have indicated they are open to potentially calling witnesses like John Bolton, the former national security adviser who said this week he would be willing to testify, Democrats would have to find a fourth Republican willing to join with them to muster the majority needed to do so.

When bitter is good

Texto completo: Many good wines have a built-in defense against being consumed by children: They are inherently bitter, a flavor that children seem genetically hard-wired to abhor.
Eventually, taste buds evolve. Young adults come to love many bitter flavors, whether in beer, dark chocolate, arugula, Negronis, coffee or tea.
Despite the prevalence of bitter flavors in popular foods and beverages, many people resist the idea that bitterness can be a positive. The old saw has it that American wine consumers talk dry but drink sweet.
The negative connotation of bitterness extends to wine descriptions. Despite the many examples of excellent wines that contain bitter flavors, no producers want to associate their wine with the word bitter. Few consumers would find such a description to be particularly attractive.
Wine marketers know that the public will flock to wines described as smooth, silky, velvety, fruit-forward, spicy, bold and rich. Bitter? Not so much.
I'm hoping that 2020 might be a year for rehabilitating the notion of bitterness in wine. I started to think about this on a trip in November to northern Italy, a land where bitter flavors seem to be built into the cuisine.
On arriving in Milan, I had dinner at Carlo e Camilla, a restaurant serving creative interpretations of northern Italian food in a beautifully restored old mill.
Seeking a bit of warming comfort on a cold, rainy night, I ordered a glass of Valpolicella Classico and was delighted with its clear-as-a-bell flavors, ringing of tart cherry and ending with a refreshing bitterness that prompted the next sip.
The next day, I finished a quick pizza lunch with an espresso, pulled and poured into a tiny cup. It was the proverbial Italian coffee experience, just enough to bolt in one go -- This one was ideal: smooth, radiant in flavor, bitter at the end and perfectly refreshing.
That night at dinner at Trattoria Masuelli San Marco, a traditional Milanese restaurant with a blessedly regional wine list, I drank an excellent Barolo Bricco Delle Viole 2007 from G.D. Vajra, vibrant and expressive with a touch of welcome bitterness as the other flavors faded away.
These beverages, though very different, had in common that punctuating bitterness. In each case, it was both cleansing and revitalizing, an acknowledgment of what had come before and a shift in attention to what would come next.
This attractive bitterness is one component of a spectrum of flavors that evolve directly from the fermentation of wine grapes. Wine can offer other forms of bitterness that may not always be so pleasing.
Tannic red wines can be astringent, a drying sensation in the mouth that can be experienced as bitter. Tannins that are part of a harmonious whole don't bother me, so long as they suit the intent of the wine.
I expect a top Barolo or Bordeaux to be tannic in youth. These tannins might be fine and barely detectable, yet firm enough to wrap up the flavors and nuances of the wines for quite a few years until they integrate. Then the youthful bitterness and astringency will largely evaporate to reveal the complexities within.
Similarly, a rustic young red from southern Italy might be robustly tannic yet still be a pleasure to drink, the astringency and bitterness of the tannins balancing out the sweet fruit.
Tannins generally come from the skins, seeds and stems of grapes, which is why white wines are rarely tannic. To provide wine with color, red grapes are crushed and macerated with their skins, and sometimes seeds and stems. To avoid color in white wines, the juice is whisked away from the pigment-bearing skins, with a notable exception.
That is the category of orange wines, white wines made as if they were reds, macerated with their skins until they take on an amber tinge. Depending on how long the juice stays in contact with the skins, these wines can become starkly tannic and quite bitter. It's all a matter of balance.
I find the welcome sort of bitterness most often in Italian reds. It doesn't matter which region or what grape, it seems to cut across both, whether Valpolicella of the Veneto, Barbera d'Asti of the Piedmont, Chianti Classico of Tuscany, the aglianicos of Campania or the Etna rossos of Sicily.
I find it in French wines, too, though not as pervasively. Good Beaujolais often has a welcome bitter component, as do the syrahs of the Northern Rhone, Bordeaux and cabernet francs of the Loire. In Spain, I sense it in traditionally made Riojas and the mencias of Ribeira Sacra.
Alcohol level plays a role, though. The higher the alcohol, particularly when you get to the range of 14.5% and above, the more likely a wine's procession of flavors will culminate in sweetness rather than bitterness. This is partly because of the elevated amount of glycerol found in high-alcohol wines. The combination of fruitiness, alcohol and glycerol contributes to a perception of sweetness, even if the wine contains no residual sugar.
The alcohol level in American wines can often provide a clue as to whether the wine will have a refreshing snappiness, of which bitterness is a component, or a flabby sweetness.
Sweet flavors of course are highly popular, whether in some of America's most expensive cult wines or in mass-produced supermarket wines. I don't quibble with anybody who enjoys them.
But stay aware of the flavors that make so many red wines so delicious, as well as other foods. Perhaps we can make 2020 a bitter year, and I mean that in the best possible way.<

Texto completo: GAINESVILLE, Ga. - The tiny white church has new locks, peepholes and brass plates. While its parishioners pray, the sanctuary is bolted shut and a police officer is now stationed outside. Soon, surveillance cameras will be installed, and the 47-member congregation will participate in active-shooter training.
This is the next chapter for the Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church, which the authorities said was targeted in mid-November. Gainesville police charged a 16-year-old white girl with planning a racially motivated knife attack to kill the black worshippers, a plot they said bore eerie similarity to a 2015 massacre at a storied African American church in Charleston, South Carolina.
In Gainesville, a small city of 40,000 residents in the heart of Georgia's poultry industry, the police chief has urged church members to use low-tech force to protect themselves. They should hurl Bibles or hot coffee, chairs or fire extinguishers, anything, he said, that can be weaponized if they are under attack and cannot safely escape.
"It's a shame that we live in a world today where we have to protect our institutions of worship, our schools, but evil knows where we are most vulnerable," Chief Jay Parrish told church leaders during a recent introduction to the active-shooter training. "The lightning bolt got too close this time."
Faced with a rise in attacks on houses of worship, the Rev. Michelle Rizer-Pool, the pastor of Bethel, and other religious leaders across the country are fortifying their buildings and preparing for the possibility of mass shootings. Some have also turned to armed security and organized law enforcement patrols.
Last week, a gunman opened fire during Sunday service at a Texas church, killing two congregants before an armed member of the church's volunteer security team fatally shot him. And over the past two years, gunmen have targeted worshippers at synagogues in Poway, California, where one person died, and in Pittsburgh, where a man shouting anti-Semitic slurs gunned down 11 people, and at a Baptist church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, where 26 people were killed and 20 more were wounded.
"Unfortunately, this is what it has come to. We have to be ready to fight back," said Rizer-Pool, a retired Army major who has led Bethel for about 18 months. "We are having to get our arms around this idea of praying and praising our God in what is supposed to be a place of peace, but having to be watchful and on the lookout."
Faith groups have responded to the growing threat of hate crimes and violence, in part, by offering specialized training and producing safety guides. The Council on American-Islamic Relations published a safety manual for religious institutions and began holding training sessions after a mass shooting at a Sikh temple in Wisconsin in 2012.
"Our thinking is, if you substitute 'mosque' for 'church' or 'synagogue' or 'temple,' the concerns are the same, so we made the guide available to the entire faith community," said Ibrahim Hooper, national communications director for the group.
After a gunman stormed the small church in Sutherland Springs in November 2017, a Dallas-area megachurch organized an active-shooter training session, which more than 600 church leaders from across the country attended. Since then, the church and the Southern Baptists of Texas Convention have provided training and security assessments at 150 churches in Texas, Oregon and Missouri. Texas legislators responded, too, by passing laws that allow anyone with a concealed-carry license to bring firearms into churches.
In Gainesville, 55 miles northeast of Atlanta, the police department has conducted training and security assessments across the city since a gunman stormed an elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut, and killed 26 people, including 20 children, in 2012.
At Bethel on one recent dreary Saturday morning, after the hymn, the prayer and the scripture reading, Parrish and Sgt. Kevin Holbrook talked to the church's leadership about fear - and fighting back. They had gathered in a backroom to discuss the creation of a security team and response plan to protect the congregation.
The new reality, the police officers said, calls for adding a layer of vigilance to the church's general culture and spirit of inclusion. Now, parishioners need to know alternate exits. They need to make eye contact with visitors. They need to set up patrol details.
But the most important strategy, the officers said, is knowing how to react if attacked: Run, hide or fight. Run to safety; hide from the attacker; or, as a last resort, fight back with anything available.
"A fire extinguisher makes a huge cloud, and if it gets on your skin, it burns. If it gets in your eyes, it blinds. And if you get hit in the head with it, it will knock you out," Parrish said. "If you have to fight, know you're fighting for your life."
The Gainesville High School student arrested a few weeks before this training session was on a mission to kill Bethel church members, the authorities said. In a carefully orchestrated plan, they said, the teenage girl acquired butcher knives, researched online, took meticulous notes and had scouted the church's location on Mill Street.
On the day she went to the church - either to launch the attack or to collect more information, the police said - she found an empty building. Authorities said the girl's plan was likely inspired by Dylann Roof, the convicted white supremacist who murdered nine worshippers during Bible study at a church of the same denomination, Emanuel AME, in Charleston, South Carolina.
The Gainesville plot was foiled by classmates who told a high school counselor about the girl's notebook, which contained the chilling plans. Police said the level of detail in her notes may have saved Bethel.
The student, who has not been identified by the authorities, was charged with criminal intent to commit murder.
Though police said her plan was racially motivated, she was not charged with a hate crime because the state is one of four across the country with no such law. But after the planned attack was made public, a group of black legislators announced that they would continue to push for a bill to create stiffer penalties for crimes motivated by hate.

Texto completo: Some residents of the local Iranian community declined to comment because they feared relatives could be targeted in Iran or be barred from traveling back and forth on either side.
Shortly after Iran fired ballistic missiles at a military base in Iraq housing U.S. troops on Tuesday night, Iranian-born Naeim Torkian's phone lit up.
"Everyone was like, 'Oh my God, war is started,'" the Louisville valet worker said of his Iranian friends and family in the U.S. and abroad, who have spent days on edge after the U.S. killed Iran's top general over the weekend.
At the same time, Babak Rezaei, 32, who came to Louisville from Iran as a refugee, was inundated with calls and texts from family and friends in Iran: "They didn't know what the U.S. reaction would be. They were asking if they should pack and run away, go to the mountains."
He told them, "I'm not sure. I'm not in the room to know what Trump is thinking. Just be prepared for the worst."
One local Iranian American family canceled flights for a family visit, he said, while others remembered all too vividly the backlash from the 1979 Iranian hostage crisis, a time when bumper stickers said, "Iranians Go Home."
But by Wednesday, some in Louisville's Iranian American community, which Rezaei estimated at several thousand, said fears about war in the Middle East and the fallout in the U.S. gave way to signs that the situation was deescalating — at least for now.
Iran's missile attack on an Iraqi base housing U.S. troops may have purposely avoided any casualties or major damage, and statements from both sides appeared to suggest both were looking to calm the open conflict that ramped up after the assassination of Gen. Qassem Soleimani.
Few Iranian Americans in Louisville and elsewhere were mourning the death of Soleimani. Rezaei said he believes that Soleimani was "a murderer" whose proxy militias killed U.S. troops and oppressed Iranians inside its borders, despite the estimated 1 million people who turned out for his funeral in Tehran.
"A friend of mine texted me right away and said Soleimani is killed, and he had a happy face," he said of the former leader of Iran's elite Quds Force.
But as Iranian Americans across the country debated how the clash would impact terrorist attacks in the Middle East and recent protests against the Iranian regime, some worried about the conflict's potential consequences for family.
Louisville resident Shahab Taheri, 23, whose family came to the U.S. for more opportunity, said his father, a dentist, still hasn't been admitted back to the U.S. after visiting home in Shiraz, Iran, in February 2018. He said President Donald Trump's "travel ban" restrictions on seven majority-Muslim nations, including Iran, are to blame.
That has left the rest of the family to operate a small sandwich restaurant in his absence, leading to strains.
"Because of the travel ban, he hasn't been able to get a visa," Taheri said. The latest tensions are "just going to make things worse."
Meanwhile, some residents of the local Iranian community declined to comment because they feared relatives could be targeted in Iran or be barred from traveling back and forth on either side.
Weighing heavily were media reports that U.S. Department of Homeland Security officials detained dozens of Iranian travelers returning from work trips or vacations and held them for hours at the Canadian border in Washington State over the weekend.
The New York Times reported that when one family asked agents why they were being questioned, an officer told them, "This is a bad time to be an Iranian."
"Every Iranian in the U.S. right now is worried," Rezaei said. "They don't want their loyalty and love for the U.S. questioned, and at the same time, what if Iran responded and somebody got killed, what is the next step? There is so much baggage" between the two nations, he said.
On Wednesday, the National Iranian American Council issued a statement expressing concern about the rocket attacks but laid blame for the conflict on Trump.
"Donald Trump owns this 100%. He inherited a working nuclear deal and a tense but stable situation with Iran. He has deeply wounded the first major diplomatic initiative between the U.S. and Iranian government in decades, and listened to ideologues who convinced him to assassinate an Iranian general. At every step of the way, he has been warned he risked moving back on the path to war. Now that day may be here," the group said.
Iranian Americans in the U.S. are estimated to number up to 1 million, according to the U.S. State Department, including thousands in the years before and after the 1979 Iranian Revolution.
Rezaei, now a middle school teacher with two children, came later after growing up in the small city of Masjed Soleiman. His father, an engineer, spent several years in prison in Iran for being a political activist seeking a more secular government.
After his father was again detained for questioning in 2005, the family left for Turkey. Rezaei was granted political asylum in the U.S., and the rest of his family was resettled in the Netherlands. Now a U.S. citizen, he didn't vote for Trump or Hillary Clinton in the last election, he said.
But, he said, "going to war with Iraq wasn't justified and wasn't necessary, and if not for the removal of Saddam Hussein, Iran wouldn't be emboldened enough to become a major player in the Middle East."
As tensions in a long-running shadow war recently escalated, he said many Iranians thought open conflict could break out in June, when Iran shot down a U.S. drone. But Trump called off a retaliatory strike because of the potential loss of life.
He said it seemed Trump "had had enough" after Iranian-backed Shiite militias surrounded and attacked the U.S. embassy in Baghdad, perhaps stirring memories of Iranian protesters taking over the U.S. embassy 1979 and holding hostages.
After Soleimani was killed, he was shocked. "I didn't think Trump would go that far," he said.
He believes it helped unite conservative Iranians, possibly undercutting recent anti-government protests in Iran amid high inflation and unemployment fueled by U.S. sanctions.
Others debated Trump's threats to attack cultural sites, which drew worries and condemnation, including from U.S. Rep. John Yarmuth, Kentucky's only Democrat in Washington.
For his part, Torkian, who now lives in Jeffersonville, Indiana, said he came to the U.S. in 2011 as a refugee from Iran, where he was part of a religious minority that suffered discrimination.
He said some including in the U.S. still count Soleimani as a hero, and he's been blocked by friends on social media for calling him a criminal. His family in several Iranian cities, including Tehran, remain "worried about war," he said
Iran's supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, dubbed Tuesday's missile attack as a "slap in the face" to the U.S., and another top official said its missile attack had concluded.
On Wednesday, Trump said Iran "appears to be standing down," and threatened Iran with additional sanctions. He also appeared to offer the Iranians an olive branch, signaling the United States does not seek a war with Tehran.
"The United States is ready to embrace peace with all who seek it," Trump said.
As some Iranian Americans wonder what's next, Taheri said that if no one is hurt or killed, "I think it's going to fade away, and there's not going to be any war. At least, I hope so."

Bogus 'guardians' steal nest eggs, sometimes life

Texto completo: The concept of "retirement," along with government social welfare programs to support old folks who no longer worked, dates to the 1880s. That's when German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck concluded that a little socialism for the elderly — Germany set retirement its age at 70 — was better than blanket entitlement programs for all his constituents.
As Bismarck's idea circulated across the Atlantic, Florida didn't take long to catch on. The New York Times noted a few years ago that by 1910 middle-class retirees joined the wealthy in discovering the Sunshine State as an appealing place to live out their golden years. Retirement communities began popping up within the next two decades.
Thus, for a century Florida has marketed itself and catered to the elderly, becoming a top destination of elders seeking a retirement pasture.
But that influx of senior citizens made Florida a target-rich environment for hucksters, shysters and ne'er do wells out to con them — or harm them in other ways. And on occasion that abuse came from those entrusted to watch out for their interests.
Now, state Rep. Colleen Burton has joined an effort to better protect our seniors.
The Lakeland Republican has sponsored a bill that would toughen oversight of the state's guardianship program for seniors, which is managed by the state Department of Elder Affairs.
Focus on this arm of the tiny agency began last summer after media reports surfaced about Rebecca Fierle, an Orlando-based guardian. The Florida Department of Law Enforcement investigated her after one of her clients, Steven Stryker, 75, died from choking on food while hospitalized in Tampa. Fierle reportedly filed a "do not resuscitate" order, which precluded hospital staff from treating Stryker, without permission from either Stryker or his family.
Subsequently, an audit by Orange County determined Fierle had billed Advent Health more than $4 million over 10 years, double-billing the hospital system and court for the same services. Fierle also had clients in Volusia and Flagler counties, and after news of the Tampa case broke, Volusia County Circuit Judge Margaret Hudson started requiring that guardians seeking a DNR appear before her for an evidentiary hearing with medical testimony and notice to the ward's family.
A few months before Stryker's case became news, the website RealClearInvestigations.com reported on Lillie White, an 88-year-old from Palm Coast. During an August 2016 doctor's appointment, while her niece remained in the waiting room, a guardian took White and declined to say where she went. Two years later White's family learned that her sole granddaughter, who had been cut out of White's will, had persuaded a judge White needed guardianship.
White, who was worth $4 million, was housed in an assisted living facility 35 miles from home. The guardian, without White's family's knowledge, sold her house and some of her other assets to pay the fees of the guardian as well as a court-appointed lawyer and other people overseeing her case.
We believe that most of the state's 500-plus guardians are professional, conscientious, devoted to the best interests of their wards and law-abiding.
But as noted above, some are not. In order to protect Florida's elderly who need this service, as well as the state's reputation as a haven for senior citizens, we must have stricter rules governing this program. For working for that, we applaud Rep. Burton and Sen. Passidomo.

The outdoor dining dome trend has come to the Fox Cities

Texto completo: GRAND CHUTE - Sure, outdoor patio dining can be a year-round thing in Wisconsin.
All it takes is a heated "igloo."
That's what the employees at the DoubleTree by Hilton hotel (formerly a Holiday Inn) at 150 Nicolet Road are calling their newly-installed domes, now open for restaurant and bar patrons looking to spend some time in the hotel courtyard in single-digit temps.
The outdoor domes are an eating-and-drinking trend of late, with the New York Times a few days ago declaring them "everywhere this winter" in the city. They've popped up in the Milwaukee area in recent years, including with Café Benelux in the Third Ward finding success with rooftop domes. Lodge Kohler is promoting some as opening soon in Green Bay. They're surfacing in Michigan, too, including at a popular brewpub in the Upper Peninsula.
The DoubleTree has three of the domes set up in the courtyard outside the hotel restaurant, the Watermark. Each sits a maximum of six people and they can be reserved for no more than two hours. There also is a $100 minimum for the food and drink tab.
The dome walls are a see-through plastic (or plastic-like material) and each shelter is screwed into the concrete. They are carpeted, decorated with lights and throw blankets and have a zippered door like a tent would have to enter and exit.
Most importantly, each one also has a space heater.
Steve Madson came to the Grand Chute hotel to be the food and beverage manager about six months ago. Before that he'd worked at a Hilton hotel in Wausau that successfully brought in a few of these wintertime domes. He wanted to do the same here.
"It's a novelty," Madson said. " ... It's just something different. You can't get it anywhere else."
The hope is for the domes to attract Fox Cities residents looking for a new and fun experience. Many of the hotel guests are business travelers, Madson said, so getting a group together outside isn't really an option for them.
Both Madson and hotel sales administrator Jessica Kerwin said they haven't heard of any other place in the Fox Cities with igloos. It's likely this is the first — and using other areas as a reference point, unlikely to be the last.
Know of another place with domes, or plans to have them this winter? Contact Shane Nyman at 920-996-7223 or snyman@gannett.com. Follow him on Twitter at @shanenyman.

Texto completo: What lures a novelist from Nigeria to Vermont?
Nature or quietude, one might guess. But for Ukamaka Olisakwe, a Montpelier-based screenwriter, novelist and poet, the draw was Shonda Rhymes.
"I like to tell anyone who asks me this question that I came here because I wanted a quiet place away from city noises so I can concentrate and create meaningful art," Olisakwe said. "But the truth is I fell in love with Vermont after watching Shonda Rhimes' 'Scandal.' "
"Scandal" is a political drama about a D.C. fixer named Olivia Pope (played by Kerry Washington) that ran from 2012 to 2018.
"There is a very romantic episode set in Vermont called 'Vermont is for Lovers, Too,' " Olisakwe said, in which a character brings Olivia, his love interest, to see the house they would have lived in had things been different for them. "I immediately knew I wanted to see that state."
That, and a friend from Nigeria had recommended the Master of Fine Arts program at the Vermont College of Fine Arts in Montpelier, where Olisakwe is a degree candidate.
In her work, Olisakwe takes intrepid dives into the deeply personal. She's written about motherhood, postpartum trauma, and growing up Christian during a time of fraught violence between Christians and Muslims in northern Nigeria.
Olisakwe has been featured in the New York Times and published two books: "Eyes of a Goddess," her first, was published in 2012. She describes her debut novel as "speculative fiction that follows the tumultuous life of a teenage humangoddess." Her second, "Ogadinma," will be published in the spring of 2020.
We caught up with her about who inspires her, what she's reading now, and her best advice for how to write about what scares you.
This interview has been edited for clarity and concision.
Q: How did you know you wanted to pursue writing?
A: I think I was too busy raising my children and being a wife to care about writing, until I got a job at a local bank and met people who read my simple correspondences and thought I always reached for a clear narrative arc in my emails. They encouraged me to take this writing thing seriously. That was in 2010. I am glad I listened.
Q: What other careers did you consider before deciding on writing?
A: I worked in sales and marketing for a local bank in Nigeria, and also worked as a customer service officer for a different bank. I enjoyed both jobs but looking back, I was exasperated all the time because of the unfair conditions and also because there was no safety in them. But they gave me the background I needed and the inspiration for my TV series, "The Calabash", which I wrote over a course of one year and was aired on Africa's biggest network –DSTV, in 2015.
Q: Are there still things you're afraid to write about? How do you overcome fear in writing about the deeply personal?
A: I recently published a very personal essay that explored my experiences with childbirth and my postpartum trauma. That was the most terrifying thing I had ever done. Having done that – having confronted that fear and survived it – I do not think there is anything I can't now not write. It took a long time to get here, and my mental health took a lot of beating because of this. But I survived it and it is thanks to the community of women I have surrounded myself with, who continually tell me that my story is valid, that my voice is strong, that it is okay to face this fear, to speak. Their support brought down the bricks of fear I had walled myself with.
Q: You came to America in 2018, a tumultuous time. What do you see as the primary role of a writer in a time when political tempers are running high?
I love E.B. White's response to the question about responsibility of a writer at a time like this. He said, "A writer should concern himself with whatever absorbs his fancy, stirs his heart, and unlimbers his typewriter. I feel no obligation to deal with politics. I do feel a responsibility to society because of going into print: a writer has the duty to be good, not lousy; true, not false; lively, not dull; accurate, not full of error. He should tend to lift people up, not lower them down. Writers do not merely reflect and interpret life, they inform and shape life."
Q: What has been the most stark difference between Nigeria and your life in Vermont?
Quietude. My city, Aba, is a fun, loud commercial place with about a million people. Montpelier has less than 8,000 people, and it reminds me of my hometown in Abagana. All that foliage and the small-town niceness. It reminds so much about home.
Still, I miss the noise of Aba, the highlife music, even the food. But I have been able to produce more creative work within a very short period since I moved here.
Q: Do you have any Vermont writers with whom you're close or whose work you admire?
A: I had the privilege of working with the poet Bianca Stone at the Vermont College of Fine Arts; she opened my eyes to the wild things I could do with poetry. I am also currently working with Frances Cannon, an illustrator and writer, whose recent graphic book, Walter Benjamin Reimagined, shows the amazing things we can do when we bend genres.
Q: What's the best piece of writing advice you've ever received?
A: To read widely and across genres, because when you do this, when you read beyond your comfort zone, beyond the constricting categorizations that tend to separate the 'literary' from the 'commercial', you will be amazed by what you learn. You will have a broader playing field.
Q: What is the biggest misconception Vermonters have about Nigerians?
A: I sincerely do not know what Vermonters think about Nigeria, given that there's this stark disparity in the racial demography here.
But in general, I like to think that Nigerians are perceived as high achievers and I shamelessly chuckle when I hear people say this. We work so hard. We are awake when others are asleep. We want to make a point about black success, especially in a country that's still rife with racial segregation. We want to go back home to our relatives with news of our successes abroad. Every time I click on a journal and spot a Nigerian-looking name, I do cartwheels and pump the air in celebration, even though I don't personally know the writers.
Q: You write extensively about marriage, motherhood and childbirth. What other work has informed your writing? What work would you recommend to people looking to explore those topics?
A: I have read everything Lesley Nneka Arimah has written, everything by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, Buchi Emecheta, Flora Nwapa, Lola Shoneyin, and many others. My critical analysis of their works has helped frame the structure and context of my own story. They captured the realities of Nigerian women in the past and present, and their works do not gloss over the subtle religious and cultural norms that contribute to our psychological makeup.
I also recommend Carmen Maria Machado's debut memoir "In the Dream House" and Yiyun Li's memoir "Dear Friend, from My life I Write to You in Your Life." These works opened my eyes to how the passage of time affects how vulnerable we can be on the page, with significant gap in time serving as the psychological distance we need before we can coherently and clearly articulate our traumatic experiences. The purpose of the distancing from the source of trauma allows our work to not appear too raw on the page, undigested.
Q: What are you reading right now?
A: I am reading Abi Dare's "The Girl With the Louding Voice."
Q: What do you still hope to see while you're in Vermont?
A: A teeming Nigerian community. That is all I hope for.

Texto completo: In 1924, the U.K.-based newspaper The Tamworth Herald warned of a dangerous craze that had "enslaved" the United States.
The paper described a "menace ... making devastating inroads on the working hours of every rank of society." People were "shamelessly" participating at all hours of the day. It was dealing "the final blow to the art of conversation."
The culprit? Crossword puzzles.
Yep, crossword puzzles, those grids of black-and-white blocks and often pun-ny clues that appear in the pages of newspapers. They were all the rage in the 1920s, until the nationwide fad eventually died along with the Charleston and pole-sitting.
Nearly a century later and we're in the "golden age of crosswords." Or so says Will Shortz. He should know: Shortz has been the editor of the storied New York Times crossword puzzle since 1993, and before that worked at Games magazine for 15 years.
"They have never been as popular, with the possible exception of 1924," Shortz, who lives in Pleasantville, told NorthJersey.com. "Now crosswords are more up to date, they're livelier, they feel more modern. I think they're attracting a wider audience than ever."
'A good kind of torture' Once upon a time, crossword fans had to rely on newspapers, magazines or published puzzle books to get their fix. Now you can solve them on your tablet or phone via apps (USA TODAY's crossword app was a big hit with its readers), or subscription-based sites like The Inkubator and Fireball Crosswords can send them to your inbox. You can sign up for Queer Crosswords or Women of Letters by donating to specific charities.
"Now there are so many other options and venues," said Anna Gundlach, a puzzle fan and crossword constructor who lives in Portland, Oregon. "A lot of the distribution channels are able to be bypassed entirely."
The proliferation of independent crossword puzzles means a wider range of clues and answers and more provocative content. Puzzle editors at the New York Times reject puzzles if they decide a clue or answer is too obscure. Gundlach said the paper passed on one of hers because it referenced Bell Biv DeVoe.
"The American Values Club, which I've done a crossword for recently, has a more Gen X, millennial bent to it," she said. "Fresher clues, not afraid to swear or talk about sex."
Gundlach has had a nearly lifelong puzzle obsession. For Howard Barkin, a love of crosswords came late. He started solving them in his early 30s during lunch breaks to get his mind off work. Now he's 45 and a legit crossword puzzle champion. Barkin, who lives in Somerset County, finished first in the 2016 American Crossword Puzzle Tournament in Stamford, Connecticut.
Shortz is the director for the contest, which pits the best crossword solvers against one another in seven games over the course of a weekend, culminating in a final round for the three finalists. Barkin's tournament victory came after solving the last puzzle in 7 minutes, 49 seconds.
The stress was high, Barkin said.
"Most people aren't used to solving a crossword with a timer counting down in a room full of 500 people," he said.
Barkin also constructs crosswords when he frees time between doing dishes and raising two young daughters. He said his favorite to solve involve "extremely evil" tricks.
"A puzzle that breaks the rules, but for a good reason," he said. "A puzzle where you have to write a Greek letter into a square or something. It's a good kind of torture."
'Wow us' Even with a host of alternatives, the gold standard crossword remains the one The New York Times publishes.
"It's capital T, capital C: The Crossword," Gundlach said. "When people talk about 'the Sunday crossword' or 'the Friday crossword,' that's generally assumed to be the New York Times crossword."
Crossword fans use the hashtag #NYTXW on Twitter to brag about their finish times and offer their often-harsh criticism of that day's puzzle. The Dec. 12 crossword elicited reviews like "Ugh. So Bible heavy and then that twist? No." and "Ok #NYTXW sorry I don't know the ATOMIC NUMBER of NEODYMIUM?!?!"
The paper's associate puzzles editor, Sam Ezersky, doesn't take that kind of criticism personally. His Facebook banner photo is a foul-mouthed pan of one of his crossword puzzles.
"It's an obsessive culture," Ezersky said. "I get being so passionate about something like this."
Ezersky grew up in a Washington, D.C., suburb as a puzzles fanatic and sold his first crossword puzzle to the Los Angeles Times when he was 16 years old. He's 24 now, lives in Hoboken, New Jersey, and spends his days sifting through some of the roughly 600 crossword puzzle submissions the New York Times receives monthly (via snail mail only). Some he turns down with nothing more than a glance. Either the grid is an odd pattern, or the words are meh.
"We're just looking for fresh things that really capture our attention," he said. "These days we really need the puzzles to wow us."
Ezersky does not construct puzzles as much as he used to, but he snagged a dream assignment this year, creating the annual "super mega" crossword that ran Dec. 15 in the New York Times' special puzzles section. It was a massive undertaking: a 50x50-square grid with 708 answers. It's so big the clues are printed on a separate page. Ezersky estimates it took hundreds of hours to construct. Still, he would have begged to do it if necessary.
"I know there were other constructors that declined because it's a such a Herculean task," he said. "If I could have been totally no filter and not cared about professionality, I would have been like, 'Please, please, please, please, please.'"
An Ezersky crossword from August shows how his mind works when he puzzles out a puzzle. He began with the across answer at the bottom left, where he placed "tech-savvy." He then stacked "heist film" right on top, giving himself the unenviable challenge of finding a down answer that ends with "lv." He did: "capital V."
Once the grid is done, he dreams up clues. He clued "tech-savvy" with "E-sharp?" – that question mark is crossword-ese indicating there's a joke or pun involved – and asked readers to get to "capital V" with the clue "Symbol for 54-down." The answer was "volts."
Constructing crossword puzzles can be agonizing, Ezersky said, but he wouldn't want any other job.
"My mantra to myself is I'm just getting started," he said. "I'm just humbled and grateful to be doing what I'm doing."

Nesting grounds tarred and no longer feathered Paving of HRBT south island for expansion displaces 25,000 birds

Texto completo: Twenty-five thousand seabirds have lost their 40-year-old nesting site on an island along the Hampton Roads Bridge-Tunnel.
It just got paved over.
A little over a month ago, crews finished paving the entire south island to prepare for the $3.862 billion project, a Virginia Department of Transportation spokeswoman said. A new island for the birds will not be constructed as part of the expansion, though transportation officials did work since 2017 with researchers and other federal agencies to try to come up with another place for them to live.
What that means for the 25,000 birds that have nested there since the early 1980s is unclear. The spokeswoman said VDOT will have to wait and see what the birds do when they return from their trip south in April. Researchers surmise some will likely hang around and try to lay eggs while others will fly off to find another spot to call home.
While the south island of the bridge-tunnel, so close to speeding cars, is a peculiar site for birds, researchers say it's unlikely that any other site in the state could successfully maintain the community of terns, black skimmers and gulls. Researchers say it's the largest seabird colony in Virginia.
That will likely mean population declines for species like the gull-billed tern, listed as threatened under the Virginia endangered species act. Also affected will be the royal tern: The south island provides breeding habitat for 98% of that species in Virginia.
"There's no doubt that there will be thousands of birds that will come back this spring," said Jim Fraser, a professor of wildlife conservation at Virginia Tech who VDOT contracted to study the bird population and come up with solutions, possibly another island. "It's really hard to predict what will happen."
They'll still be able to eat the plentiful fish, but without a spot to nest they might get themselves in trouble by roosting at the nearby airport.
Still, good news might be on the horizon.
In October, the Department of Game and Inland Fisheries submitted a formal request to the Army Corps of Engineers to use dredged material to build a bird island, said the agency's executive director Ryan Brown. That could be a long ways off, up to a couple years, Brown said. The agency is still waiting to see if it could get the material and does not yet know how much an island would cost.
"Our main focus is the birds right now," said Paige Pearson, spokeswoman for the game department. "We're trying to figure out the best thing for them."
The birds' future has been made more precarious because of the Trump administration, which came out with an interpretation in 2017 of the century-old Migratory Bird Treaty Act.
It all but ends punishment for bird deaths from "incidental bird takes," or destruction of nests during something like construction, according to The New York Times. If the purpose or intent of the activity is not to take birds, nests or eggs, then it is no longer prohibited. The administration has discouraged local governments and businesses from taking precautionary measures to protect birds, The Times reported.
The rollback of the act led a group of attorneys general to sue the Interior Department, which oversees the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. A group of former Interior Department appointees called for an end to the opinion.
Now, Virginia is not required to provide mitigation like building a new island as it starts construction on the bridge-tunnel.
In Virginia, efforts to find a new home for the birds go back about three years and have faced a number of roadblocks including federal permitting, protection of fish habitats and safety concerns around U.S. naval airspace.
Virginia Tech researchers gave VDOT a number of options such as stringing together 24 barges along the east side of the island. They looked at expanding the south island by four acres near Fort Wool, which is on the National Register of Historic Places. Early discussions even included the option of the birds using an island 68 miles away.
VDOT came close to developing an elbow-shaped portion of land on Willoughby Spit, once eyed for condo development. The Navy ultimately quashed that, writing to the state in May 2018 that the birds would pose a danger to pilots who use the airspace.
Virginia Tech professors had their minds set on building a new island nearby. The birds like islands because of the lack of mainland predators like raccoons and foxes and because of the rich food source in the waters below, researchers said. They've nested on the south island because of threats from those animals as well as development around the Eastern Shore.
"Habitat for birds like terns in the lower bay is really at a premium now, and most of the areas they were able to nest in have been developed in some form or fashion," said Michael Parr, president of the D.C.-based nonprofit American Bird Conservancy.
Still, even the new island idea came with concerns. Biologists with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration warned that building a 10-acre island in the middle of Hampton Roads would impact habitat for the dozen fish species in the area. While building a structure could attract some species of fish, it would take away habitat for others like those species that use the bottom, said Dave O'Brien, a fisheries biologist with the agency. It could also impact fish migratory patterns.
Plus it could cost several millions of dollars, though an Army Corps program could bring the price tag way down.
That back-and-forth about options for the seabirds continued until June 2018, when the researchers felt VDOT stopped responding.
The reason, they say, is the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service told them continued conservation efforts for migratory birds are now "purely voluntary," in accordance with the 2017 interpretation, according to a copy of the letter obtained by The Times.
If the state is successful in building an island for the birds, Fraser is optimistic they will come back.
"If you build it they will come," he said.

Texto completo: House will vote to limit Trump's war power amid concerns on Iran strategy
The House will vote Thursday on a measure that would limit President Donald Trump's ability to wage war with Iran. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Trump's action last week — authorizing a drone strike that killed top Iranian General Qasem Soleimani — was "provocative and disproportionate" and done without consulting Congress. But even if the measure passes the House, which is controlled by Democrats, it will face hurdles in the GOP-controlled Senate. And Trump can veto the measure, as he did last year when Congress tried to end the American military role in Yemen.

Trump takes re-election message to Ohio
The commander in chief will hold his first rally of 2020 Thursday in Ohio, an important swing state that supported him in 2016. The "Keep America Great" rally will be held in the Huntington Center in downtown Toledo. Trump easily won Ohio by 8 percentage points over Democrat Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election, although he lost in Toledo. Trump's visit comes amid increased tension between the U. S. and Iran. On Wednesday, Trump threatened Iran with additional sanctions following Iran's rocket attack on airbases in Iraq housing U. S. troops.

Puerto Rico earthquake: Many still left without power
Government inspectors on Thursday are expected to visit one of the hardest-hit towns affected by the string of earthquakes in Puerto Rico, according to the New York Times. The worst quake — a magnitude 6. 4 that struck early Tuesday — killed at least one person, injured at least nine and caused the power outage that has left about half a million people in the U. S. territory without electricity. The powerful quake was the strongest the island has seen in more than a century and comes as many areas are still recovering from the devastation of the deadly Hurricane Maria in 2017, which killed thousands. Punta Ventana, a coastal rock formation that had formed a sort of rounded window, and other popular landmarks were damaged by the quakes, officials said.

Will Harry and Meghan's royal bombshell upstage Duchess Kate's birthday?
While Duchess Kate celebrates her 38th birthday on Thursday, royal fans are eagerly waiting to learn more about Prince Harry and Duchess Meghan's stunning decision to step down from their senior royal roles. The couple, who also confirmed that they intend to split their time between North America and the United Kingdom, also said they're working on becoming "financially independent. " After their announcement came a palace statement, suggesting that some in the royal family were not amused.

Australian wildfires: Residents urged to flee as hot, windy conditions escalate
The unprecedented wildfires in Australia, which have killed at least 25 people and destroyed 2,000 homes, are expected to escalate Thursday, according to the Associated Press. Residents in the path of infernos razing southeastern Australia were urged to evacuate as hot and windy conditions are forecast in the region. Experts say climate change has increased bushfire risk in Australia by lengthening the fire season, decreasing precipitation and increasing temperature. The U. S. State Department upped its travel warning level for Australia on Wednesday and recommended that tourists consider postponing their trips.

Texto completo: Many good wines have a built-in defense against being consumed by children: They are inherently bitter, a flavor that children seem genetically hard-wired to abhor.
Eventually, taste buds evolve. Young adults come to love many bitter flavors, whether in beer, dark chocolate, arugula, Negronis, coffee or tea.
Despite the prevalence of bitter flavors in popular foods and beverages, many people resist the idea that bitterness can be a positive. The old saw has it that American wine consumers talk dry but drink sweet.
The negative connotation of bitterness extends to wine descriptions. Despite the many examples of excellent wines that contain bitter flavors, no producers want to associate their wine with the word bitter. Few consumers would find such a description to be particularly attractive.
Wine marketers know that the public will flock to wines described as smooth, silky, velvety, fruit-forward, spicy, bold and rich. Bitter? Not so much.
I'm hoping that 2020 might be a year for rehabilitating the notion of bitterness in wine. I started to think about this on a trip in November to northern Italy, a land where bitter flavors seem to be built into the cuisine.
On arriving in Milan, I had dinner at Carlo e Camilla, a restaurant serving creative interpretations of northern Italian food in a beautifully restored old mill.
Seeking a bit of warming comfort on a cold, rainy night, I ordered a glass of Valpolicella Classico and was delighted with its clear-as-a-bell flavors, ringing of tart cherry and ending with a refreshing bitterness that prompted the next sip.
The next day, I finished a quick pizza lunch with an espresso, pulled and poured into a tiny cup. It was the proverbial Italian coffee experience, just enough to bolt in one go - This one was ideal: smooth, radiant in flavor, bitter at the end and perfectly refreshing.
That night at dinner at Trattoria Masuelli San Marco, a traditional Milanese restaurant with a blessedly regional wine list, I drank an excellent Barolo Bricco Delle Viole 2007 from G.D. Vajra, vibrant and expressive with a touch of welcome bitterness as the other flavors faded away.
These beverages, though very different, had in common that punctuating bitterness. In each case, it was both cleansing and revitalizing, an acknowledgment of what had come before and a shift in attention to what would come next.
This attractive bitterness is one component of a spectrum of flavors that evolve directly from the fermentation of wine grapes. Wine can offer other forms of bitterness that may not always be so pleasing.
Tannic red wines can be astringent, a drying sensation in the mouth that can be experienced as bitter. Tannins that are part of a harmonious whole don't bother me, so long as they suit the intent of the wine.
I expect a top Barolo or Bordeaux to be tannic in youth. These tannins might be fine and barely detectable, yet firm enough to wrap up the flavors and nuances of the wines for quite a few years until they integrate. Then the youthful bitterness and astringency will largely evaporate to reveal the complexities within.
Similarly, a rustic young red from southern Italy might be robustly tannic yet still be a pleasure to drink, the astringency and bitterness of the tannins balancing out the sweet fruit.
Tannins generally come from the skins, seeds and stems of grapes, which is why white wines are rarely tannic. To provide wine with color, red grapes are crushed and macerated with their skins, and sometimes seeds and stems. To avoid color in white wines, the juice is whisked away from the pigment-bearing skins, with a notable exception.
That is the category of orange wines, white wines made as if they were reds, macerated with their skins until they take on an amber tinge. Depending on how long the juice stays in contact with the skins, these wines can become starkly tannic and quite bitter. It's all a matter of balance.
I find the welcome sort of bitterness most often in Italian reds. It doesn't matter which region or what grape, it seems to cut across both, whether Valpolicella of the Veneto, Barbera d'Asti of the Piedmont, Chianti Classico of Tuscany, the aglianicos of Campania or the Etna rossos of Sicily.
I find it in French wines, too, though not as pervasively. Good Beaujolais often has a welcome bitter component, as do the syrahs of the Northern Rhone, Bordeaux and cabernet francs of the Loire. In Spain, I sense it in traditionally made Riojas and the mencias of Ribeira Sacra.
Alcohol level plays a role, though. The higher the alcohol, particularly when you get to the range of 14.5% and above, the more likely a wine's procession of flavors will culminate in sweetness rather than bitterness. This is partly because of the elevated amount of glycerol found in high-alcohol wines. The combination of fruitiness, alcohol and glycerol contributes to a perception of sweetness, even if the wine contains no residual sugar.
The alcohol level in American wines can often provide a clue as to whether the wine will have a refreshing snappiness, of which bitterness is a component, or a flabby sweetness.
Sweet flavors of course are highly popular, whether in some of America's most expensive cult wines or in mass-produced supermarket wines. I don't quibble with anybody who enjoys them.
But stay aware of the flavors that make so many red wines so delicious, as well as other foods. Perhaps we can make 2020 a bitter year, and I mean that in the best possible way.

Texto completo: Editor's note: Jennifer Cervantes is among our 2020 Movers & Shakers — profiles on people or groups expected to shape Las Cruces in the coming year.
LAS CRUCES - Las Cruces-based children's author Jennifer Cervantes — pen name J.C. Cervantes — had a great year in 2019, landing on the New York Times Best Sellers list, and shows no signs of slowing in 2020.
This year, fans can expect the third and highly anticipated book of Cervantes' "The Storm Runner Series." Also, you might be seeing the series' characters on screen soon.
"I can't give specifics yet, but I can tell you that it's been optioned for television," she said.
Cervantes, 49, didn't imagine herself becoming an author while growing up, but she's been a success since her first foray into the business.
Her first book, "Tortilla Sun," published in 2010, won a New Mexico Book Award and Zia Book Award, among many other accolades.
Next, she began writing a trilogy for young adults that follows the story of a young New Mexican boy named Zane Obispo and his three-legged dog named Rosie. Zane meets with colorful characters inspired by Mayan mythology in his adventures.
The first book of the series, "The Storm Runner," published in September 2018 and landed on the New York Times Best Sellers list. The second book, "The Fire Keeper," debuted at No. 4 on the list when in published in September 2019.
The third book, "The Shadow Crosser," will be released Sept. 1, 2020.
Cervantes is the second author to publish under Rick Riordan Presents, a Disney-Hyperion imprint, headed by Riordan, best-selling author of the "Percy Jackson" series.
"The platform that they have created has been nothing short of remarkable and is so necessary in this changing industry," she said.
Also, Cervantes said she's finished up a young adult novel that should be announced soon. "And after that? A couple more books are in the works that I can't wait to talk about," she said.
On tour Now that she's a New York Times best selling author, Cervantes said "so much is the same and so much is different."
"I still get up every day and face the page with both enthusiasm and doubt," she said. "But I also now have this platform that allows me to reach more readers and connect with more kids and that's one of the best parts of this job."
In 2019, she went on a book tour and traveled to conferences and festivals all over the country.
"When I am on the road, I often tell people about the magic of the Land of Enchantment," Cervantes said. "There is an uncompromising natural beauty here and we are so fortunate to call this place home."
Cervantes said she hopes to continue writing stories for as long as she can for anyone who will read them.
"My goal is to keep writing books that connect kids and readers to something greater than themselves," she said. "Books that offer a frame for dreaming, imagining, learning, and growing."
Once upon a time ... When Cervantes was a girl, she said she didn't think about becoming an author.
"While I have always been a voracious reader, I didn't realize my passion for writing until later," she said. "I look up to so many people in the writing world who are doing amazing work — from editors and agents, to other authors and community organizers."
Cervantes, a San Diego native, attended both the University of New Mexico and New Mexico State University where she earned her bachelor's in communication studies and a master's in rhetoric and professional communication.
Cervantes met her husband, Joseph Cervantes, who is a state senator and last year ran for governor, while she was a student at UNM. The couple have three daughters, Alexandra, 25, Isabella, 24, and Juliana, 20.
Aside from being a best-selling author, Cervantes has worn many hats in Las Cruces and has volunteered on several boards and several other charitable organizations.
She is a former executive director of the Community Foundation of Southern New Mexico which fosters and expands the nonprofit industry in Doña Ana, Grant, Hidalgo, Lincoln, Luna, Otero and Sierra counties.
Cervantes said she is now focusing 100% percent on writing.
"I'm incredibly proud of the body of work I have created. Every time I sit down to write a new book, I wonder if I can do it again. It's just part of the process," Cervantes said, adding that she's "astonished" she was able to pen a trilogy.
"Writing a multi-book series is a bit like swimming in the ocean without a life vest," she said. "But that's the beauty of art. It allows you to reach for the horizon in increments. Inch by inch just to see what's on the other side."
Cervantes encourages writers young and old to follow their dreams if they wish to be an author one day.
"My advice for anyone who wants to write is read widely, follow your heart and write what moves you, don't let the critics in too soon, study your craft and be kind," she said.

Texto completo: "They have never been as popular, with the possible exception of 1924. Now crosswords are more up to date, they're livelier, they feel more modern."
Will Shortz
New York Times crossword puzzle editor
In 1924, the U.K.-based newspaper The Tamworth Herald warned of a dangerous craze that had "enslaved" the United States.
The paper described a "menace ... making devastating inroads on the working hours of every rank of society." People were "shamelessly" participating at all hours of the day. It was dealing "the final blow to the art of conversation."
The culprit? Crossword puzzles.
Yep, crossword puzzles, those grids of black-and-white blocks and often pun-ny clues that appear in the pages of newspapers. They were all the rage in the 1920s, until the nationwide fad eventually died along with the Charleston and pole-sitting.
Nearly a century later and we're in the "golden age of crosswords." Or so says Will Shortz. He should know: Shortz has been the editor of the storied New York Times crossword puzzle since 1993, and before that worked at Games magazine for 15 years.
"They have never been as popular, with the possible exception of 1924," Shortz, who lives in Pleasantville, told NorthJersey.com. "Now crosswords are more up to date, they're livelier, they feel more modern. I think they're attracting a wider audience than ever."
'A good kind of torture' Once upon a time, crossword fans had to rely on newspapers, magazines or published puzzle books to get their fix. Now you can solve them on your tablet or phone via apps (USA TODAY's crossword app was a big hit with its readers), or subscription-based sites like The Inkubator and Fireball Crosswords can send them to your inbox. You can sign up for Queer Crosswords or Women of Letters by donating to specific charities.
"Now there are so many other options and venues," said Anna Gundlach, a puzzle fan and crossword constructor who lives in Portland, Oregon. "A lot of the distribution channels are able to be bypassed entirely."
The proliferation of independent crossword puzzles means a wider range of clues and answers and more provocative content. Puzzle editors at the New York Times reject puzzles if they decide a clue or answer is too obscure. Gundlach said the paper passed on one of hers because it referenced Bell Biv DeVoe.
"The American Values Club, which I've done a crossword for recently, has a more Gen X, millennial bent to it," she said. "Fresher clues, not afraid to swear or talk about sex."
Gundlach has had a nearly lifelong puzzle obsession. For Howard Barkin, a love of crosswords came late. He started solving them in his early 30s during lunch breaks to get his mind off work. Now he's 45 and a legit crossword puzzle champion. Barkin, who lives in Somerset County, finished first in the 2016 American Crossword Puzzle Tournament in Stamford, Connecticut.
Shortz is the director for the contest, which pits the best crossword solvers against one another in seven games over the course of a weekend, culminating in a final round for the three finalists. Barkin's tournament victory came after solving the last puzzle in 7 minutes, 49 seconds.
The stress was high, Barkin said.
"Most people aren't used to solving a crossword with a timer counting down in a room full of 500 people," he said.
Barkin also constructs crosswords when he frees time between doing dishes and raising two young daughters. He said his favorite to solve involve "extremely evil" tricks.
"A puzzle that breaks the rules, but for a good reason," he said. "A puzzle where you have to write a Greek letter into a square or something. It's a good kind of torture."
'Wow us' Even with a host of alternatives, the gold standard crossword remains the one The New York Times publishes.
"It's capital T, capital C: The Crossword," Gundlach said. "When people talk about 'the Sunday crossword' or 'the Friday crossword,' that's generally assumed to be the New York Times crossword."
Crossword fans use the hashtag #NYTXW on Twitter to brag about their finish times and offer their often-harsh criticism of that day's puzzle. The Dec. 12 crossword elicited reviews like "Ugh. So Bible heavy and then that twist? No." and "Ok #NYTXW sorry I don't know the ATOMIC NUMBER of NEODYMIUM?!?!"
The paper's associate puzzles editor, Sam Ezersky, doesn't take that kind of criticism personally. His Facebook banner photo is a foul-mouthed pan of one of his crossword puzzles.
"It's an obsessive culture," Ezersky said. "I get being so passionate about something like this."
Ezersky grew up in a Washington, D.C., suburb as a puzzles fanatic and sold his first crossword puzzle to the Los Angeles Times when he was 16 years old. He's 24 now, lives in Hoboken, New Jersey, and spends his days sifting through some of the roughly 600 crossword puzzle submissions the New York Times receives monthly (via snail mail only). Some he turns down with nothing more than a glance. Either the grid is an odd pattern, or the words are meh.
"We're just looking for fresh things that really capture our attention," he said. "These days we really need the puzzles to wow us."
Ezersky does not construct puzzles as much as he used to, but he snagged a dream assignment this year, creating the annual "super mega" crossword that ran Dec. 15 in the New York Times' special puzzles section. It was a massive undertaking: a 50x50-square grid with 708 answers. It's so big the clues are printed on a separate page. Ezersky estimates it took hundreds of hours to construct. Still, he would have begged to do it if necessary.
"I know there were other constructors that declined because it's a such a Herculean task," he said. "If I could have been totally no filter and not cared about professionality, I would have been like, 'Please, please, please, please, please.'"
An Ezersky crossword from August shows how his mind works when he puzzles out a puzzle. He began with the across answer at the bottom left, where he placed "tech-savvy." He then stacked "heist film" right on top, giving himself the unenviable challenge of finding a down answer that ends with "lv." He did: "capital V."
Once the grid is done, he dreams up clues. He clued "tech-savvy" with "E-sharp?" – that question mark is crossword-ese indicating there's a joke or pun involved – and asked readers to get to "capital V" with the clue "Symbol for 54-down." The answer was "volts."
Constructing crossword puzzles can be agonizing, Ezersky said, but he wouldn't want any other job.
"My mantra to myself is I'm just getting started," he said. "I'm just humbled and grateful to be doing what I'm doing."

Texto completo: EAST LANSING — George Julius Perles, the polarizing and outspoken former Michigan State University football player, coach, athletic director and Board of Trustees member, died late Tuesday night, the Free Press has learned. He was 85.
Perles died peacefully in East Lansing with his family surrounding him, according to multiple sources close to family. He announced he was battling Parkinson's disease in 2017.
Perles was born July 16, 1934, in Detroit's west side and was a football and baseball star at Detroit Western. He earned all-state football honors as a junior and senior and graduated in 1953, then briefly attended the University of Tennessee before returning to Detroit and joining the Army with a number of his friends.
He served in the Army from 1954-56 and was stationed in Hawaii, where he continued to play football. After returning from active duty, Perles joined Duffy Daugherty's football team at MSU as an offensive and defensive tackle in the fall of 1956. Perles lettered for the Spartans in 1958 before a knee injury ended his playing career.
"He's a tough kid. It was a tough neighborhood," Danny Boisture, a former Daugherty assistant coach who grew up in the same neighborhood near Vernor and Junction as Perles, told the Free Press in 1982. "He was a great football player, a typical red-blooded young kid of that day."
After getting his bachelor's degree from MSU in 1960, Perles joined Daugherty's staff as a graduate assistant. He received his master's in educational administration in 1961 and went on to coach high school football first at St. Rita's in Chicago and St. Ambrose High in Grosse Pointe Park, which went 23-2 in three seasons and won the 1962 City League championship with Perles as head coach.
After a two-year stint as an assistant coach at the University of Dayton, Perles returned to MSU and Daugherty's staff, coaching defensive line from 1967-71.
Tom Landau, one of Perles' players at St. Ambrose, told the New York Times in 1990 that Perles was a "streets of Detroit guy."
"That's where he was from and it shaped the way he acted," Landau told the Times. "He was tough, but he was very loyal. If he thought you were with him, he stuck by you. But if he thought you weren't, you were his enemy for life."
Chuck Noll, the legendary NFL coach, poached Perles in 1972 to coach the Pittsburgh Steelers' budding defensive line. Perles became one of the architects of the Steelers' vaunted Steel Curtain defense that dominated the decade, with his innovative stunt 4-3 formation helping Pittsburgh win four Super Bowls. He became Noll's defensive coordinator in 1978 and assistant head coach from 1979-82.
That led Perles to a head coaching job with the Philadelphia Stars of the upstart United States Football League. He helped build the team throughout 1982 but never coached a game when the league began in the spring of 1983 because his alma mater came calling for the job he coveted most.
MSU hired Perles to replace Muddy Waters on Dec. 3, 1982, giving the 48-year-old a five-year contract three years after he was bypassed by Waters for the job. He also applied for the job in 1976, after Denny Stolz was forced out and the school was placed on probation.
"That's the only college job in the country I would be interested in," Perles said in 1976. "I think anybody is interested in going home if he's not running away from something. And I'm definitely not running away from anything."
The decision to hire Perles resulted in a $1 million lawsuit by the Stars that was settled out of court, reportedly with MSU paying the USFL team $175,000. It foreshadowed the mercurial relationship between the university and Perles over the next three decades.
Perles promised to lead the Spartans, coming off a 2-9 season in Waters' final year, back to the national respectability it enjoyed during Daugherty's tenure.
"If we make all decisions based on winning the Rose Bowl," Perles told the Free Press in late 1982, "we won't make a poor decision."
He guided the Spartans to the 1988 Rose Bowl, their first since 1966, along with the 1987 Big Ten title that was their first since 1978. They also won a share of the 1990 conference championship, which would be MSU's last until Mark Dantonio earned a share in 2010.
"George was one of the most renowned coaches in America; everybody knew who Coach Perles was and what he brought to the game," Dantonio said in a statement Wednesday. "... He always brought a blue-collar mentality and really we've embraced a lot of things in our program over the years that came from him. He left a legacy and was an impactful figure."
Perles' tenure was marked with a number of ups and downs.
It included allegations of steroid abuse — documented in the book, "Behind the Green Curtain: The Sacrifice of Ethics and Academics in Michigan State Football's Rise to National Prominence" — that included offensive lineman Tony Mandarich, the No. 2 pick in the 1989 NFL draft.
On a few occasions, Perles leveraged his own NFL connections into more power at MSU. He reportedly was going to take over the Green Bay Packers after the Spartans won the Big Ten in 1987, only to remain at MSU. He then used talks with the New York Jets in 1990 to sway his alma mater into giving him the athletic director job along with his football responsibilities.
"There are a lot of people who take offense at my dad's personality," Perles' son, John, told the Free Press in 1982, before MSU hired his father. "He's not exactly a soft-spoken guy. There are always a few people overwhelmed by his aggressiveness."
Perles parlayed the Jets offer into a 10-year deal as football coach and athletic director that did not last. His stint as athletic director ended in 1992 after friction with then-president John DiBiaggio, who demanded Perles pick one job or the other. Perles then was fired as football coach by ensuing president Peter McPherson near the end of the 1994 season.
In 12 seasons, Perles was 73–62–4 overall and 58–37–2 in the Big Ten. However, he was forced to vacate five wins in his final season due to the NCAA finding major violations at MSU during his tenure — though Perles never was personally implicated in the NCAA's charges of academic fraud and payments to recruits. The Spartans received four years of probation and lost nine scholarships for Perles' eventual replacement Nick Saban, who had served as Perles' defensive coordinator for the 1987 Big Ten title team.
"He was one of my mentors in this profession," Saban, now at Alabama, said in a statement Wednesday, "and he gave me my first opportunity to be in a position of leadership as the defensive coordinator at Michigan State. George was always a great friend and someone who I turned to for advice on many occasions. I learned an incredible amount of both football and life from him over the years.
"... Those five years at Michigan State, which culminated with a Rose Bowl victory at the end of the 1987 season, showed us the type of foundation necessary to build a program."
After being fired, Perles sued MSU in 1995 for breach of contract and age discrimination but eventually dropped the lawsuit two months later.
In 2006, Perles ran and won a seat on the MSU Board of Trustees as a Democrat, and was re-elected in 2014. He served from 2007 until November 2018, when he resigned and cited health concerns following a year which included fallout from the Larry Nassar conviction, the resignation of president Lou Anna K. Simon and athletic director Mark Hollis, and scrutiny into sexual assault allegations surrounding the school's football and basketball programs.

Bogus guardians steal money, sometimes life

Texto completo: The concept of retirement, along with government social welfare programs to support old folks who no longer worked, dates to the 1880s. That's when German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck concluded that a little socialism for the elderly — Germany set retirement its age at 70 — was better than blanket entitlement programs for all his constituents.
As Bismarck's idea circulated across the Atlantic, Florida didn't take long to catch on. The New York Times noted a few years ago that by 1910 middle-class retirees joined the wealthy in discovering the Sunshine State as an appealing place to live out their golden years. Retirement communities began popping up within the next two decades.
Thus, for a century Florida has marketed itself and catered to the elderly, becoming a top destination of elders seeking a retirement pasture.
But that influx of senior citizens made Florida a target-rich environment for hucksters, shysters and ne'er do wells out to con them — or harm them in other ways. And on occasion that abuse came from those entrusted to watch out for their interests.
Now, state Rep. Colleen Burton has joined an effort to better protect our seniors.
The Lakeland Republican has sponsored a bill that would toughen oversight of the state's guardianship program for seniors, which is managed by the state Department of Elder Affairs.
Focus on this arm of the tiny agency began last summer after media reports surfaced about Rebecca Fierle, an Orlando-based guardian. The Florida Department of Law Enforcement investigated her after one of her clients, Steven Stryker, 75, died from choking on food while hospitalized in Tampa. Fierle reportedly filed a "do not resuscitate" order, which precluded hospital staff from treating Stryker, without permission from either Stryker or his family.
Subsequently, an audit by Orange County determined Fierle had billed Advent Health more than $4 million over 10 years, double-billing the hospital system and court for the same services. Fierle also had clients in Volusia and Flagler counties, and after news of the Tampa case broke, Volusia County Circuit Judge Margaret Hudson started requiring that guardians seeking a DNR appear before her for an evidentiary hearing with medical testimony and notice to the ward's family.
WFTS in Tampa recently reported on a Pinellas County guardian charged with draining her 92-year-old client's bank account of $541,000 in just 10 months. She had convinced him to grant her power of attorney over his affairs and proceeded to pay herself $1,600 a day.
Meanwhile, the state's director of the program resigned last year amid a lengthy backlog complaints about guardians — which the Department of Elder Affairs now says has been addressed.
In response, Burton and Sen. Kathleen Passidomo, R-Naples, have filed bills that will strengthen protections for the more than 3,800 Floridians managed by guardians.
We believe that most of the state's 500-plus guardians are professional, conscientious, devoted to the best interests of their wards and law-abiding.
But as noted above, some are not. In order to protect Florida's elderly who need this service, as well as the state's reputation as a haven for senior citizens, we must have stricter rules governing this program. For working for that, we applaud Rep. Burton and Sen. Passidomo.
This editorial was originally published in the Lakeland Ledger.
Judge Lisa Davidson replaced Rebecca Fierle as guardian for two Brevard residents.

Facebook pushes untrusted sources after missile attack

Texto completo: Searches for information about Iran's missile strike against U.S. troops at a pair of Iraqi military bases Tuesday night were more right than wrong on Google and YouTube, a change from past situations that saw fake stories rise to the top.
Searches on Facebook, however, took users to non-trusted sources in other countries, and to organizations most USA TODAY readers wouldn't be familiar with.
Google and YouTube produced stories from news organizations most of us have grown up with. A search for "Iran attacks United States" produced results from the New York Times, Fox, CNN, CBS, BBC, Bloomberg and others, as well as tweets from President Donald Trump, Iran's prime minister and a Washington Post reporter, while YouTube had much of the same, minus the tweets.
Facebook, which has vowed many times to clean up its act after tampering by the Russians in the 2016 election, pointed users to video reports from mostly unknown sources.
The search for the same query produced three videos, a Pakistan journalist named Awami Awaz, a "personal blog" called "Army Power" and WION from India.
None had the blue "verified" check mark, which Facebook shows to verify to users that these are trusted sources.
On Twitter, it wasn't hard to find some misleading tweets, like the one from self-described screenwriter Mark Hughes saying that 20 soldiers had died, or Breitbart's announcement as fact that comedian George Lopez had agreed to assassinate Trump. (That was part of a routine.)
On YouTube, misleading headlines could play havoc with viewers. The U.S. has not declared war on Iran. But South Africa's SABC TV posed the question: "Has the US just declared war?"
A non-trusted source, a YouTuber named Gmshawaii Ba, said flatly, "The draft is coming back."
And the obviously parody International Inquirer used this headline: "12 year old children now eligible for draft." Not when there isn't one.
Meanwhile, the internet is ripe with "deepfake," videos, which have been re-edited and computer-altered to look real.
How to tell if the video is fake? Start with trusted sources. Does it come from a reliable news organization you've lived with all your life, or someone you've never heard of?
Is the video low-resolution or grainy? Is it a single person talking in the video? Is it relatively short -- say 30 seconds or 60 seconds long? Those are usually telltale signs the video is potentially fake.
Other telltale signs discernible to the naked eye, according to Subbarao Kambhampati, a computer science professor at Arizona State University: Different-size eyes or ill-formed teeth, or more than two eyes, or inconsistencies in the background of the video.

Texto completo: HIGASHI-OSAKA, Japan - The rice balls are gone. So are the juice bottles, which Mitoshi Matsumoto priced to sell early. Most of his store's shelves stand empty, but he has kept some cigarette cartons and bottles of alcohol in the hope that his long-running battle with the 7-Eleven convenience store chain will end in his favor.
The company that controls the 7-Eleven chain, Seven & I Holdings Co., terminated Matsumoto's franchise last week after he decided to close his store for a day on New Year's Day, and it has stopped supplying him.
It was the latest battle between Matsumoto and one of Japan's most well-known companies over harsh working conditions in the Japanese convenience store industry, which demands that stores stay open seven days a week, 24 hours a day, for all 365 days a year.
Matsumoto remains in business, but just barely. The screen on the ATM flashes "not in operation." His two full-time employees are ready to jump to new jobs once he finally closes, and his seven part-time employees no longer show up.
Still, he plans to stay open as long as he can.
"I want to stay in business for the sake of myself and other owners throughout the country," said Matsumoto, 57, who says he plans to continue his fight in a local court.
A spokesman for Seven & I, Katsuhiko Shimizu, said the company terminated Matsumoto's contract on Dec. 31. He denied that the termination was tied to Matsumoto's plan to close for a day, and instead cited numerous customer complaints about the store and Matsumoto's disparaging remarks about the company on social media.
Matsumoto's fight with 7-Eleven has made him famous in Japan, a country that has long struggled with a strenuous and sometimes deadly work culture.
Those strains are evident in the convenience store industry.
Japan's convenience store chains have expanded dramatically in recent years in an effort to capture market share at one another's expense.
While the expenses were minimal for the chains, the expansion took a toll on the franchisees who operate the vast majority of Japan's more than 55,000 convenience stores. Unable to find dependable workers, many owners increasingly worked themselves.
"Under the current situation, the company can have it both ways," said Naoki Tsuchiya, a professor at Musashi University in Tokyo and an expert on labor issues in the convenience store industry, who called Matsumoto "a significant figure" in the nationwide discussion over the industry.
Despite his troubles with the company, Matsumoto said he hoped a legal fight would restore his franchise and allow him to open up. He said 7-Eleven offered to pay for his remaining inventory - owners are responsible for buying their own products from the company at wholesale prices - but he refused. He wants Japan's convenience store industry to change instead.
"If I win the case, I hope more will follow and raise their voices," he said. "If I lose, many will get depressed and more afraid of 7-Eleven."

Texto completo: Miya's Sushi, a longtime fixture in New Haven known for its distinctive and sustainable sushi interpretations, has announced it will close at the end of the year.
Restaurant owner Bun Lai announced plans in a Facebook post on New Year's Eve. "At the end of 2020, with the deepest gratitude in our hearts to everybody who has carried us along the way, Miya's will close its doors," he wrote. "We chose to close- sooner rather than later - so that my family and I would still be healthy enough to be able to give back more but in other ways."
Lai did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Lai's Japanese mother, Yoshiko, a nutritionist and former caterer, opened Miya's, New Haven's first sushi restaurant, in 1982. Through its tenure, it became a destination for creative and healthful sushi rolls and dishes, with plates named for poetry, literature, religion and cultural philosophy references.
In more recent years, Miya's has been a leader in creating menu items with sustainable ingredients, using invasive species or other organisms that threaten the ecological balance or require pesticides for eradication. Sushi rolls also feature insects as a source of protein, including wild grasshoppers and fly larvae. The majority of the menu is plant-based.
"At Miya's, you will experience a kinder and more caring future, where sushi has evolved to become a way of eating that honors and celebrates all life on Earth," the website reads.
Miya's and Lai have received widespread attention for the restaurant's mission, garnering coverage in the New York Times, the New Yorker, Vice and many other national publications. Lai was a semifinalist for a James Beard award (Best Chef: Northeast) in 2013, and a documentary, "Blind Sushi," in which Lai and travel writer Ryan Knighton forage and dive along the New England coast, was nominated for a Beard award in 2018. In 2016, Lai was also named one of President Barack Obama's "Champions of Change for Sustainable Seafood."
Throughout its final year, Miya's will offer "a one-page menu where we will be rotating creations from our library of original sustainable sushi recipes," according to Lai's Facebook post. "Items from this menu will be priced as low as possible so that more people will be able to experience something very meaningful that we all created together."
Miya's Sushi is at 68 Howe St. in New Haven. 203-777-9760, miyassushi.com.

After 100 years, we're in a crossword 'golden age'

Texto completo: In 1924, the U.K.-based newspaper The Tamworth Herald warned of a dangerous craze that had "enslaved" the United States.
The paper described a "menace ... making devastating inroads on the working hours of every rank of society." People were "shamelessly" participating at all hours of the day. It was dealing "the final blow to the art of conversation."
The culprit? Crossword puzzles.
Yep, crossword puzzles, those grids of black-and-white blocks and often pun-ny clues that appear in the pages of newspapers. They were all the rage in the 1920s, until the nationwide fad eventually died along with the Charleston and pole-sitting.
Nearly a century later and we're in the "golden age of crosswords." Or so says Will Shortz. He should know: Shortz has been the editor of the storied New York Times crossword puzzle since 1993, and before that worked at Games magazine for 15 years.
"They have never been as popular, with the possible exception of 1924," Shortz, who lives in Pleasantville, told NorthJersey.com. "Now crosswords are more up to date, they're livelier, they feel more modern. I think they're attracting a wider audience than ever."
'A good kind of torture' Once upon a time, crossword fans had to rely on newspapers, magazines or published puzzle books to get their fix. Now you can solve them on your tablet or phone via apps (USA TODAY's crossword app was a big hit with its readers), or subscription-based sites like The Inkubator and Fireball Crosswords can send them to your inbox. You can sign up for Queer Crosswords or Women of Letters by donating to specific charities.
"Now there are so many other options and venues," said Anna Gundlach, a puzzle fan and crossword constructor who lives in Portland, Oregon. "A lot of the distribution channels are able to be bypassed entirely."
The proliferation of independent crossword puzzles means a wider range of clues and answers and more provocative content. Puzzle editors at the New York Times reject puzzles if they decide a clue or answer is too obscure. Gundlach said the paper passed on one of hers because it referenced Bell Biv DeVoe.
"The American Values Club, which I've done a crossword for recently, has a more Gen X, millennial bent to it," she said. "Fresher clues, not afraid to swear or talk about sex."
Gundlach has had a nearly lifelong puzzle obsession. For Howard Barkin, a love of crosswords came late. He started solving them in his early 30s during lunch breaks to get his mind off work. Now he's 45 and a legit crossword puzzle champion. Barkin, who lives in Somerset County, finished first in the 2016 American Crossword Puzzle Tournament in Stamford, Connecticut.
Shortz is the director for the contest, which pits the best crossword solvers against one another in seven games over the course of a weekend, culminating in a final round for the three finalists. Barkin's tournament victory came after solving the last puzzle in 7 minutes, 49 seconds.
The stress was high, Barkin said.
"Most people aren't used to solving a crossword with a timer counting down in a room full of 500 people," he said.
Barkin also constructs crosswords when he frees time between doing dishes and raising two young daughters. He said his favorite to solve involve "extremely evil" tricks.
"A puzzle that breaks the rules, but for a good reason," he said. "A puzzle where you have to write a Greek letter into a square or something. It's a good kind of torture."
'Wow us' Even with a host of alternatives, the gold standard crossword remains the one The New York Times publishes.
"It's capital T, capital C: The Crossword," Gundlach said. "When people talk about 'the Sunday crossword' or 'the Friday crossword,' that's generally assumed to be the New York Times crossword."
Crossword fans use the hashtag #NYTXW on Twitter to brag about their finish times and offer their often-harsh criticism of that day's puzzle. The Dec. 12 crossword elicited reviews like "Ugh. So Bible heavy and then that twist? No." and "Ok #NYTXW sorry I don't know the ATOMIC NUMBER of NEODYMIUM?!?!"
The paper's associate puzzles editor, Sam Ezersky, doesn't take that kind of criticism personally. His Facebook banner photo is a foul-mouthed pan of one of his crossword puzzles.
"It's an obsessive culture," Ezersky said. "I get being so passionate about something like this."
Ezersky grew up in a Washington, D.C., suburb as a puzzles fanatic and sold his first crossword puzzle to the Los Angeles Times when he was 16 years old. He's 24 now, lives in Hoboken, New Jersey, and spends his days sifting through some of the roughly 600 crossword puzzle submissions the New York Times receives monthly (via snail mail only). Some he turns down with nothing more than a glance. Either the grid is an odd pattern, or the words are meh.
"We're just looking for fresh things that really capture our attention," he said. "These days we really need the puzzles to wow us."
Ezersky does not construct puzzles as much as he used to, but he snagged a dream assignment this year, creating the annual "super mega" crossword that ran Dec. 15 in the New York Times' special puzzles section. It was a massive undertaking: a 50x50-square grid with 708 answers. It's so big the clues are printed on a separate page. Ezersky estimates it took hundreds of hours to construct. Still, he would have begged to do it if necessary.
"I know there were other constructors that declined because it's a such a Herculean task," he said. "If I could have been totally no filter and not cared about professionality, I would have been like, 'Please, please, please, please, please.'"
An Ezersky crossword from August shows how his mind works when he puzzles out a puzzle. He began with the across answer at the bottom left, where he placed "tech-savvy." He then stacked "heist film" right on top, giving himself the unenviable challenge of finding a down answer that ends with "lv." He did: "capital V."
Once the grid is done, he dreams up clues. He clued "tech-savvy" with "E-sharp?" – that question mark is crossword-ese indicating there's a joke or pun involved – and asked readers to get to "capital V" with the clue "Symbol for 54-down." The answer was "volts."
Constructing crossword puzzles can be agonizing, Ezersky said, but he wouldn't want any other job.
"My mantra to myself is I'm just getting started," he said. "I'm just humbled and grateful to be doing what I'm doing."

When bitter is good Understanding how the flavor can enhance your wine

Texto completo: Many good wines have a built-in defense against being consumed by children: They are inherently bitter, a flavor that children seem genetically hard-wired to abhor.
Eventually, taste buds evolve. Young adults come to love many bitter flavors, whether in beer, dark chocolate, arugula, Negronis, coffee or tea.
Despite the prevalence of bitter flavors in popular foods and beverages, many people resist the idea that bitterness can be a positive. The old saw has it that American wine consumers talk dry but drink sweet.
The negative connotation of bitterness extends to wine descriptions. Despite the many examples of excellent wines that contain bitter flavors, no producers want to associate their wine with the word bitter. Few consumers would find such a description to be particularly attractive.
Wine marketers know that the public will flock to wines described as smooth, silky, velvety, fruit-forward, spicy, bold and rich. Bitter? Not so much.
I'm hoping that 2020 might be a year for rehabilitating the notion of bitterness in wine. I started to think about this on a trip in November to northern Italy, a land where bitter flavors seem to be built into the cuisine.
On arriving in Milan, I had dinner at Carlo e Camilla, a restaurant serving creative interpretations of northern Italian food in a beautifully restored old mill.
Seeking a bit of warming comfort on a cold, rainy night, I ordered a glass of Valpolicella Classico and was delighted with its clear-as-a-bell flavors, ringing of tart cherry and ending with a refreshing bitterness that prompted the next sip.
The next day, I finished a quick pizza lunch with an espresso, pulled and poured into a tiny cup. It was the proverbial Italian coffee experience, just enough to bolt in one go - This one was ideal: smooth, radiant in flavor, bitter at the end and perfectly refreshing.
That night at dinner at Trattoria Masuelli San Marco, a traditional Milanese restaurant with a blessedly regional wine list, I drank an excellent Barolo Bricco Delle Viole 2007 from G.D. Vajra, vibrant and expressive with a touch of welcome bitterness as the other flavors faded away.
These beverages, though very different, had in common that punctuating bitterness. In each case, it was both cleansing and revitalizing, an acknowledgment of what had come before and a shift in attention to what would come next.
This attractive bitterness is one component of a spectrum of flavors that evolve directly from the fermentation of wine grapes. Wine can offer other forms of bitterness that may not always be so pleasing.
Tannic red wines can be astringent, a drying sensation in the mouth that can be experienced as bitter. Tannins that are part of a harmonious whole don't bother me, so long as they suit the intent of the wine.
I expect a top Barolo or Bordeaux to be tannic in youth. These tannins might be fine and barely detectable, yet firm enough to wrap up the flavors and nuances of the wines for quite a few years until they integrate. Then the youthful bitterness and astringency will largely evaporate to reveal the complexities within.
Similarly, a rustic young red from southern Italy might be robustly tannic yet still be a pleasure to drink, the astringency and bitterness of the tannins balancing out the sweet fruit.
Tannins generally come from the skins, seeds and stems of grapes, which is why white wines are rarely tannic. To provide wine with color, red grapes are crushed and macerated with their skins, and sometimes seeds and stems. To avoid color in white wines, the juice is whisked away from the pigment-bearing skins, with a notable exception.
That is the category of orange wines, white wines made as if they were reds, macerated with their skins until they take on an amber tinge. Depending on how long the juice stays in contact with the skins, these wines can become starkly tannic and quite bitter. It's all a matter of balance.
I find the welcome sort of bitterness most often in Italian reds. It doesn't matter which region or what grape, it seems to cut across both, whether Valpolicella of the Veneto, Barbera d'Asti of the Piedmont, Chianti Classico of Tuscany, the aglianicos of Campania or the Etna rossos of Sicily.
I find it in French wines, too, though not as pervasively. Good Beaujolais often has a welcome bitter component, as do the syrahs of the Northern Rhone, Bordeaux and cabernet francs of the Loire. In Spain, I sense it in traditionally made Riojas and the mencias of Ribeira Sacra.
Alcohol level plays a role, though. The higher the alcohol, particularly when you get to the range of 14.5% and above, the more likely a wine's procession of flavors will culminate in sweetness rather than bitterness. This is partly because of the elevated amount of glycerol found in high-alcohol wines. The combination of fruitiness, alcohol and glycerol contributes to a perception of sweetness, even if the wine contains no residual sugar.
The alcohol level in American wines can often provide a clue as to whether the wine will have a refreshing snappiness, of which bitterness is a component, or a flabby sweetness.
Sweet flavors of course are highly popular, whether in some of America's most expensive cult wines or in mass-produced supermarket wines. I don't quibble with anybody who enjoys them.
But stay aware of the flavors that make so many red wines so delicious, as well as other foods. Perhaps we can make 2020 a bitter year, and I mean that in the best possible way.

Child tax credit underscores shifting priorities

Texto completo: America's income gap, the difference in annual earnings between those at the top of the economic ladder and those at the bottom, is the greatest its been in more than a half-century. The nation's wealth gap is even greater. The bottom 50% of Americans hold just 1% of the nation's wealth. The top 10% hold 70%, of which the top 1% accounts for 32%.
In 2017 the Trump administration and a Republican Congress made tax changes that increased the gaps. Some of the changes, the biggest drop in corporate tax rates in history, for example, benefited the 10% of Americans who own 84% of stocks.
Changes to the federal child tax credit, which shifted more money to the upper middle class than the poor, slid through the shadows.
Recently, The New York Times published a story with the headline, "Tax Credit for Children, Except the Ones Who Need It Most." The story, by reporter Jason DeParle, explained that Trump's tax reform made households with incomes up to $400,000 for married couples eligible for up to a $2,000 per child tax credit. Unlike a tax deduction, a tax credit comes right off the top. Owe Uncle Sam $5,000 but have two $2,000 child tax credits? Pay $1,000.
Republicans structured the tax credit so that the higher an eligible family's income, the bigger the credit. Minimum wage workers saw their per-child tax credit increase by just $75. In the nation's poorest counties, the Times reported, more than half of all parents earned too little to get the full benefit.
Nationally, 35% of households had incomes too low to receive the full credit. A single parent with two children would have to make $30,000 to qualify for the $4,000 credit, which is partially refundable. Parents who earn enough to qualify but owe little or nothing in taxes can get up to $1,400 back as a refund that again is based on earnings. A policy of giving more to families that need less help makes no sense. Giving the full benefit to poor households would reduce childhood poverty by 25% or more.
Study after study has found that children who grow up in families with less financial stress, more stability, less hunger and access to at least some of the enriching experiences middle-class children are afforded, do better in school, earn more, pay more taxes as adults, and cost society less in social services like drug treatment and incarceration.
Democrats, with support from some Republicans, have filed several bills that would grant the full tax credit, or in some cases even larger credits, to low-income families with children. It's impossible to assess, in the chaos that is Trump's Washington, what the odds are that bills that provide more help for the poor will become law. In fact, the trend, given the administration's threatened cuts to the nation's food stamp program, is in the other direction.
Increasing the child tax credit and making it equally available to all families below a household income level of, say, $200,000 or $300,000 would dramatically lower the poverty rate. It would also brighten the future of millions of children and strengthen the nation. Please give the effort your support.

Texto completo: America has just completed a banner year for private giving. The 10 largest donations in 2019 amounted to $6.2 billion, up 8% from 2018. These went to a wide array of causes, and came from men and women of the right (Jim Walton, Karen Huntsman) and the left (George Soros, Eric Schmidt). When the total of all U.S. philanthropy becomes available this summer, it will show that Americans voluntarily gave away around $430 billion in 2019.
Private giving builds institutions of civil society that provide valuable services, alleviating many pressing public problems. The New York Public Library has operated as a charity since its founding 125 years ago, and Central Park is run by a donor-funded conservancy that rescued it from decay in 1980. Quietly effective philanthropies get little visibility, though, and scant credit from journalists, academics and politicians.
Instead, progressive editorialists and political candidates openly call for deep cuts in the charitable deduction, an end to tax protections for churches and other charities, the taxing down of personal fortunes, and new regimes in which government becomes the sole ministrant of societal needs. Givers like the Kochs and Waltons are treated as punching bags for ideological reasons, but even liberals such as Bill Gates, Eli Broad and Robert Smith are pilloried for practicing philanthropy.
Mr. Gates is called everything from a rank amateur to a manipulating megalomaniac for making massive donations to public health, education and other causes. The Broad Museum in Los Angeles has been picketed and its patron savaged for his gifts to charter schools. Paying off $34 million of loans for Morehouse College students earned Mr. Smith opprobrium for having made money in private equity.
"A gift like [Mr. Smith's] can make people believe that billionaires are taking care of our problems, and distract us from the ways in which others in finance are working to cause problems," writes Anand Giridharadas in "Winners Take All," this year's trendiest critique of philanthropy. One of a half-dozen books now out with a similar tone, it was lavishly praised by the Washington Post, New York Times and NPR for arguing that charitable giving is an "elite charade" that does more harm than good, a way of disguising merciless taking by appearing to give back, a tool of injustice in a rigged system, a means of suppressing dissent.
Today's critics of private giving are most misleading in their suggestion that it is primarily a game played by "the billionaire boys' club." That's not even close to accurate. The lion's share of America's vast philanthropy comes from ordinary citizens, 100 million of whom make charitable gifts annually, with the average household donating around $3,000. In addition, 77 million citizens volunteer time and labor. This broad generosity powers some 1.5 million independent nonprofits across the country, operating in every imaginable part of the economy, pursuing a panoply of approaches to national improvement.
Rather than being an instrument of plutocracy, America's highly decentralized philanthropy is one of its most pluralistic and democratic elements. Philanthropy disperses authority, gives individuals direct opportunities to change their communities, and lets nonmainstream alternatives have their day in the sun.
Charitable problem-solving also has many practical advantages. What works to alleviate homelessness or loneliness in old age may be different in Nebraska than in New York. With government programs it is almost impossible, even illegal, to pursue different strategies in different places. In philanthropy that's easy -- local variegation is one of the field's inherent strengths. Studies show that philanthropic efforts are more effective than government in the amount of social repair accomplished per dollar.
One reason many progressives are so hostile to private giving is that government and charity are often competitors. They function in many of the same areas and sometimes attack the same problems, albeit in different ways. Critics of philanthropy argue that it is disruptive, even illegitimate, for civil-society groups to compete with the state. Public-employee unions, agency officials and activists for big government scream when social authority and resources migrate from state bureaus and into independent organizations like charter schools, churches, medical charities and trainers of the poor.
Authoritarians have always hated independent civil society. Russian, Iranian and Chinese dictators clamped down on charities in recent years because they want the state to be the only forum for human influence. "Everything within the state, nothing outside the state, nothing against the state" was Mussolini's encapsulation. For people with a controlling impulse, private wielders of resources represent alternative sources of ideas and social legitimacy that must be suppressed in favor of unitary government prescriptions.
Even democratically elected leaders are often jealous of civil society and blind to its productivity. Vice President Joe Biden said a few years ago that "every single great idea that has marked the 21st century, the 20th century, and the 19th century has required government vision and government incentive." The late Sen. Ted Kennedy once said that "the ballot box is the place where all change begins in America."
Actually, government and ballot boxes had surprisingly little to do with many climactic shifts in American history. From the rise of universal schooling to the revulsion against slavery, from the creation of great universities to the national mastery of rocketry and space flight, private donors paved the way for many breakthroughs. Charitable action has been one of the country's most valuable sources of ingenuity and social progress. In fields from brain research to immunotherapy, from family revival to improving teacher quality, philanthropists continue to lead.
If we view social refinement as solely the work of government, we will eventually despair because the political process so often disappoints. When we recognize the contributions of community institutions, self-help groups, faith activity, local norms, neighborhood networks and grass-roots collaborations, our prospects appear much brighter.
In America, independent problem-solvers pounce on many issues before they even rise to national notice. Privately funded civil society attends to a vast range of problems and threats. This is a distinguishing strength of the U.S. It will be a tragedy if Americans allow our rich tradition of voluntary action to be smothered.

Sonos Takes On Tech Giants --- The maker of high-end speakers tunes in to backlash against Google, Amazon

Texto completo: [Financial Analysis and Commentary]
Sonos has a lot to lose in publicly challenging Google and Amazon.com. But on second glance, perhaps not as much as it seems.
The maker of high-end wireless speakers sued Google in federal court on Tuesday, accusing the internet giant owned by Alphabet Inc. of infringing on its patents. It also filed a similar complaint with the International Trade Commission, seeking an injunction against Google's devices such as its Home smart speakers and even its Pixel smartphones. Google and Amazon have both denied the claims.
Amazon wasn't named as a party in either complaint, but unnamed Sonos executives told the New York Times that they believe Amazon's Echo smart speakers are also infringing on its technology. Focusing on Google, they said, was to avoid battling two of the world's largest companies in court at the same time. But the article also noted that Sonos Chief Executive Patrick Spence has been in discussions to testify in Congress about his company's issues with both tech giants.
At a glance, the move seems like madness. Sonos is tiny compared with the two internet behemoths.
Moreover, Sonos relies on both companies' voice platforms to keep its products competitive in a world where consumers now want their speakers to take commands -- and talk back. The first Amazon Echo that launched widely in 2015 proved popular enough to crimp sales of Sonos speakers that year, even given the latter's undisputed advantage in quality.
But Sonos might be on the right side of the trend this time. Public sentiment has soured greatly against tech companies over the past year. And official scrutiny has sharpened. Lawmakers and regulators across the globe are closely examining Google and Amazon, as well as Facebook, for antitrust violations. That alone could limit any retaliatory actions against Sonos, as any such move would be seen as confirming the company's gripes about the tech platforms' outsize power. Sonos made a point of noting in its complaint that Google sells many of its devices as "loss leaders" to generate future sales.
Sonos also is hedging its bets. The company recently acquired a "private by design" voice platform to develop for future products. It also has launched new devices in recent months that don't include Google's and Amazon's voice assistants, which suggests a growing distaste among consumers to put tech company's ears in their homes.
Now, Sonos just needs to get the right people listening in.

MALL SHOOTER SCARE TRIGGERED BY MAN IN MAGA HAT

Texto completo: An altercation over a man's refusal to remove a "Make America Great Again" hat triggered a recent active shooter scare at a Luzerne County mall, police said.
The altercation started outside when a man confronted another man wearing the hat in support of President Donald Trump inside the Wyoming Valley Mall in Wilkes-Barre, Pa., on Dec. 30, authorities said Tuesday. The man threatened to assault the Trump supporter if he did not remove the hat, then tried to knock it off his head.
Police say the man wearing the hat then pulled a gun out and pointed it at the ground, prompting the other man to flee.
The tense dispute spread on social media and caused a panic at the mall, the Citizens Voice reported.
Wilkes-Barre Township Police Chief Will Clark said firearms are not permitted inside the mall, but the altercation happened near the Macy's inside the mall. The armed man had a concealed carry permit, and Chief Clark said no charges will be filed against him.
Facebook exec's post
Longtime Facebook executive Andrew Bosworth said in a blunt internal post that the company's advertising tools were crucial to the election of President Donald Trump in 2016 and may help him win again, but that executives must resist the temptation to make policy changes that would alter the course of legitimate political debate.
The post, which appeared on the company's internal systems last week and surfaced in news reports Tuesday, reflected the combination of anguish, defensiveness and brash self-confidence that many of the company's employees have more privately expressed in the difficult aftermath of Mr. Trump's unexpected victory.
Mr. Bosworth's post also shed light on the thinking within the company's highest levels as it heads into a new election year amid controversies over its reluctance to police lies by politicians or limit their ability to narrowly target small groups of voters.
Super Bowl ad battle
Michael Bloomberg's presidential campaign has secured a 60-second advertising spot to air nationally during next month's Super Bowl telecast, an ad buy that will most likely cost at least $10 million.
Hours after The New York Times reported Mr. Bloomberg's plans, President Donald Trump's re-election campaign said that it, too, had reserved 60 seconds' worth of advertising during the game for roughly $10 million.
The dueling ads on the year's biggest night of TV are evidence that the two New York billionaires are preparing for a schoolyard brawl on the national airwaves over the coming months, with each increasingly willing to dip into his vast resources - Mr. Bloomberg is spending his own fortune, and Mr. Trump has a nine-figure campaign war chest - to broadcast their messages.

Texto completo: It's been a little slow lately for new music, but things will pick up in the next few weeks and 2020 should be a busy year.
Here are some releases that we know about:
Halsey, "Manic" (Jan. 17): The electropop hitmaker from New Jersey has stated that her third record will in fact be manic and all over the place stylistically.
Anti-Flag, "20/20 Vision" (Jan. 17): Reacting to three years of Trump, expect a fiery album from the veteran Pittsburgh punks.
Frances Quinlan, "Likewise" (Jan. 31): The first solo album from the emotive Philly-bred Hop Along frontwoman, recorded with her bandmate Joe Reinhart, comes with a cover of Built to Spill's "Carry the Zero."
Kesha, "High Road" (Jan. 31): Kesha promises a return to her pop roots on this fourth album that features guest appearances by Big Freedia, Sturgill Simpson and Brian Wilson.
Green Day, "Father of All ..." (Feb. 7): We can expect the usual exuberance, and maybe then some, from the ageless pop-punk trio that will head out on the Hella Mega Tour with album No. 13.
Tame Impala, "The Slow Rush" (Feb. 14): At last, the follow-up to 2015's "Currents," recorded, produced and mixed by Australian psych-rocker Kevin Parker, who told The New York Times, "A lot of the songs carry this idea of time passing, of seeing your life flash before your eyes, being able to see clearly your life from this point onwards."
Grimes, "Miss Anthropocene" (Feb. 21): Five years after "Art Angels," the Canadian art-pop singer-songwriter returns with what she's called "a concept album about the anthropomorphic goddess of climate change."
The 1975, "Notes on a Conditional Form" (Feb. 21): The fourth album from the British band is expected to include 20 tracks, including the screaming single "People."
Alanis Morissette, "Such Pretty Forks in the Road" (May 1): The 25th anniversary of "Jagged Little Pill" is timed with a Broadway musical based on the album's themes written by Oscar-winning writer Diablo Cody ("Juno"). Morissette is also releasing her first new album since 2012, led by the single "Reasons I Drink."
Weezer, "Van Weezer" (May 15): Would you believe this is the 14th album from Weezer? This time, the band will go with heavy riffage, leaning on influences like Kiss and Van Halen, the inspiration for the title.
The Killers, "Imploding the Mirage" (spring): The first album in three years from the Vegas rockers was preceded by a politically charged gospel-inflected ballad, "Land of the Free," brought to life with a Spike Lee-directed video.
Matt Berninger, "Serpentine Prison" (TBA): Speaking with NME, The National frontman said of his debut solo album, produced by Memphis soul legend Booker T. Jones, "I just wanted to see if I could do something by myself, so I brought in 20 of the most brilliant musicians and some of the coolest people I know."
Code Orange (title and date TBA): This week marks three years since the Pittsburgh hardcore/metal band released "Forever," the breakout third album that earned them widespread acclaim and a Grammy nomination. In 2020, we'll hear what brutal sounds they've been brewing.
Ozzy Osbourne, "Ordinary Man" (TBA): The metal icon will head out on "No More Tours 2" with this 12th studio album backed by producer/guitarist Andrew Watt, bassist Duff McKagan (Guns N' Roses) and drummer Chad Smith (Red Hot Chili Peppers) and preceded by the singles "Under the Graveyard" and "Straight to Hell."
Cardi B (TBA): The NYC rapper will follow her Grammy-winning 2018 debut, "Invasion of Privacy," with a second album that may or may not be called "Tiger Woods."
Dua Lipa, "Future Nostalgia" (early 2020): The British dance-pop sensation says she was aiming for more of a "live element" on her sophomore album, which was inspired by artists "from Gwen Stefani to Madonna to Moloko to Blondie and Outkast, to name just a few."
Lil Baby, "My Turn" (early 2020): The Grammy-nominated Atlanta rapper behind "Drip Too Hard" posted on Instagram that for his second album, "I called it 'My Turn' 'cause I feel like everybody else had a lil' turn. It's my turn now."
Marilyn Manson (TBA): The shock-rocker, who recently released an explosive cover of The Doors' "The End," is working with Shooter Jennings on the follow-up to 2017's "Heaven Upside Down."
Doobie Brothers (TBA): On this 50th anniversary year, the Doobies, working with producer John Shanks (Bon Jovi, Sheryl Crow, Goo Goo Dolls), will release their first new material since 2010's "World Gone Crazy."
Dixie Chicks, "Gaslighter" (TBA): For the first studio album in 14 years, the country-pop trio hooked up with hitmaker Jack Antonoff (Taylor Swift, Lorde, St. Vincent).

Texto completo: President Donald Trump often talks about leaving the Middle East, getting out of "endless wars" and spending our resources here at home under a policy of "America First."
So it was quite a moment when, on Sunday night, he threatened to impose "very big sanctions" on Iraq if the Iraqi parliament follows through on its nonbinding resolution to oust American forces from its soil. "We will charge them sanctions like they've never seen before, ever," Mr. Trump said. "It'll make Iranian sanctions look somewhat tame."
If you're trying to follow along from home, this is a perfectly understandable moment to say, "Wait, what? Isn't that a complete flip?"
The key word here is "moment." That's where Mr. Trump lives: in the moment. You wouldn't think Don from Queens could be so zen, but it is what it is. He consistently says he wants to extricate the U.S. from Mideast conflicts. Except for all the times he doesn't. With each about-face, his defenders and detractors rush to debate the theory behind the policy change, when there is none.
We should be used to it by now. Mr. Trump has told us time and time again: He leads with his gut, listens to his instincts, keeps people guessing and goes with the flow. "I prefer to come to work each day and just see what develops," he says in his ghostwritten autobiography "The Art of the Deal."
To expect intellectual consistency from Mr. Trump is like expecting a dog to meow. It's not in his nature.
Mr. Trump has made it clear he doesn't care for extensive preparation or briefing papers. He likes to go into summits unencumbered by such things, relying instead on his ability to read the room.
When Mr. Trump announced he was pulling U.S. troops out of Syria last fall, there was no policy development behind it, according to sources familiar with the event. He had a phone conversation with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and made the decision on the fly. Mr. Erdogan told Mr. Trump that he had to make way for Turkish troops because NATO allies cannot fight each other.
Aides and advisers were appalled but couldn't convince Mr. Trump to reverse course - until they told him about some oil wells we'd be leaving behind. Having talked for years about "taking the oil" as recompense for Middle East military interventions, he changed course again. Had he read his briefing papers, he'd have known about the marginally significant oil wells already. He'd also have known we didn't have to do Mr. Erdogan's bidding.
But that's how Mr. Trump governs, from one moment to another, responding to stimuli from conversations, TV shows and his own mood. (In a deposition years ago, he admitted that his estimate of his net worth changes with how he feels about himself on any given day.)
Most presidents try to follow a consistent line of policy, philosophy or both. Mr. Trump is a man of dots - scattershot moments connected only by Mr. Trump's authorship of them. He has a few core convictions ("tariffs are good," "get the oil," etc.), a love of praise and a desire to collect disparate "wins" he can use as talking points. Thus, you can be sure he will simultaneously campaign on pulling troops out of the Middle East and sending them in, in the same way he boasts about lowering trade barriers and raising them. Consistency is in the eye of the beholder, not the man.
This leaves observers, at home and abroad, to connect the dots on their own. His fans see three-dimensional chess, or, when that won't fly, they see the "real" Trump being manipulated by sinister forces. His most ardent foes see, well . lots of different things. The Iranians, for example, made the mistake of believing Mr. Trump's rhetoric about getting out of the Middle East and its endless wars.
Over the last six months, Iran committed one outrageous and provocative act after another, and the Trump administration did little in response, because the Magic 8 Ball that is Mr. Trump's gut said, "Ask Again Later." Then, suddenly, the president changed his mind and seized a new moment, opting for a massive escalation by killing Qassem Soleimani, Iran's most important general. Mr. Trump's reasoning might have been, as the White House alleges, to avert imminent threats. Or it might have been because he wanted to change media coverage, or influence the impeachment process, or because he had bad clams for lunch.
The wisdom of his decision depends entirely on which dots you connect from his presidency so far. But for Mr. Trump, it was just another moment.

Texto completo: In an earlier era of environmental awareness, the Very Rev. James Parks Morton insisted that clergy must consider protecting the world's natural resources a key spiritual priority.
“The most profound role churches have always played is that of moral arbiter," he told the Globe in 1991. “They point to the crises and the deepest meaning of a situation. Think of the role the churches played on the abolition issue."
The environmental crisis, he added, “is an issue of that spiritual magnitude."
Rev. Morton, who formerly served as dean of the Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine in Manhattan, N.Y., for a quarter-century, died Saturday in his Manhattan home. He was 89 and had been treated for Alzheimer's disease, his daughter Polly Morton Barton told The New York Times.
During his tenure, he transformed the cathedral into a vibrant center for the arts, the homeless, circus performers, endangered animals, and interfaith engagement.
He gave over the cathedral's great stone pulpit to a variety of speakers, among them the homeless and gay people (even before they were officially accepted as clergy in the Episcopal Church). He invited Catholic priests, rabbis, imams, and leaders of other faiths. Among the guest preachers were the Nobel laureates Archbishop Desmond Tutu and Elie Wiesel.
“One Sunday morning the Dalai Lama will preach the sermon, on another occasion a rabbi teaches from the pulpit," he wrote in 1986 for an anniversary report of his Harvard College class.
Rev. Morton's efforts also expanded the church's role in the surrounding community. He opened a homeless shelter on the cathedral grounds and worked to empower the poor by helping createa program that assists people as they rebuild, occupy, and own apartments in abandoned buildings.
He also introduced the Blessing of the Animals on St. Francis Day. Elephants and llamas — as well as neighborhood dogs, cats, and goldfish (in bowls) — were brought in for the annual event. The elephants came from the Big Apple Circus, which, for a time, found its off-season home at the cathedral.
“The animals bless us as we bless them," Rev. Morton said at the 1990 ceremony. “So, in the presence of these beautiful beasts, we will pray this year for ourselves: that we may have the wisdom and the courage to be more faithful custodians of God's creation."
Rev. Morton also turned the cathedral into a cultural destination by hosting music and dance programs, including some that continue to this day.
Kusumita Pedersen, a scholar of religion who worked on interfaith programs with Rev. Morton, said social justice remained at the core of all he did: “He told me, 'My conservative wealthy donors forgive me all the social justice programs if I give them the arts.' "
For several years he brought Leonard Bernstein and the New York Philharmonic to the cathedral on New Year's Eve.
He was appointed dean of the cathedral in 1972 by the Rev. Paul Moore Jr., who was then the new bishop of the diocese. Together, they re-envisioned the church as “a medieval cathedral for New York City" that would engage the city in all its promise and problems.
At the time, New York City was in the midst of a financial crisis that almost drove it to bankruptcy. The cathedral, between Columbia University and Morningside Park, with Harlem beyond, was a symbol of the city's stagnancy. A century after its cornerstone had been laid, the building remained unfinished. What had been built was largely unused and sat on a neglected piece of property.
In 1979, Rev. Morton began a program for unemployed young residents of Harlem and Newark, N.J., to train with master stonemasons to continue construction of the cathedral towers. “We will resume building this great house of God," he said at the time, “and revive the dying art of stone craft by teaching it to the young people of our neighborhood." The program lasted several years.
“His cathedral was on the urban margin," Matthew Weiner, an associate dean at Princeton University, wrote about Rev. Morton in his doctoral dissertation about religious life in New York City, “but, through his own jagged sense of curiosity and showmanship, he transformed this crippling fact into an asset by inventing projects that involved those from the surrounding communities in inventive ways."
A native of Houston, James Parks Morton attended Phillips Exeter Academy in New Hampshire and Harvard College, from which he graduated in the class of 1951. As a senior majoring in architecture, he heard a speech by Rev. Moore that changed his life.
“He heard Paul tell the story about St. Martin giving his cloak to the poor," his daughter Polly told the Times.
After Harvard, Rev. Morton did graduate work at Trinity College in Cambridge, England, from which he received a master's in theology, and then studied at the General Theological Seminary in New York, he wrote in 1966 for his 15th Harvard class report.
Subsequently, he was a priest in Jersey City, N.J., coordinated a Joint Urban Program for the Episcopal church in New York, and directed the Urban Training Center for Christian Mission in Chicago, which encouraged greater awareness of society's needs.
“Only as the minister is himself grasped by the realities of life may he teach his flock to make decisions as members of the people of God," he told the Globe in 1965.
In addition to his daughter Polly, Rev. Morton leaves his wife, Pamela Taylor Morton, whom he married in 1954; two other daughters, Sophia and Maria; eight grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren. A fourth daughter, Hilary Morton Shontz, died in 2010.
His funeral will be held at 6 p.m. Saturday in the cathedral.
Rev. Morton stepped down as dean of the cathedral at the end of 1996 and founded the Interfaith Center of New York, which promotes mutual understanding among religions.
Years before climate change became a key matter for political campaigns, Rev. Morton said the environmental crisis was also “a religious issue."
In the 1991 Globe interview, he called it “one of the most sacred issues there is. We have been bad stewards.
“We are destroying God's creation."

Metro Boston free paper closes after 19 years
The free Metro Boston paper is shutting down after 19 years in business. A memo from publisher Ed Abrams and associate publisher Susan Peiffer issued on Wednesday said it didn't make sense to continue to operate the paper after the New York and Philadelphia Metro papers were sold. They said the Metro Boston paper lost access to “centralized resources, and a difficult decision had to be made." The Metro New York and Metro Philadelphia papers have been sold to Schneps Media, the owner of New York's other free daily, amNewYork. (Schneps is combining the two New York papers.) The Alliance for Audited Media reported that the Metro Boston's recent average daily circulation was 50,000, as of the third quarter of 2019, for editions that published Monday through Thursday. The Boston Globe owned a 49 percent stake in the Metro Boston, dating back to when The New York Times Co. owned the Globe and decided to invest in the free paper. That stake was transferred when the Times Co. sold the Globe to John Henry in 2013. — JON CHESTO
GOVERNMENT
Baker concerned about Galvin's new standards for broker-dealers
Wall Street isn't happy with Secretary of State William Galvin's effort to impose a new, more stringent conduct standard for broker-dealers. Neither, apparently, is Governor Charlie Baker. The governor wrote a letter to Galvin on Tuesday, expressing concerns about Galvin's “fiduciary conduct standard" for securities brokers. Baker said his administration fears the regulation may create more confusion than clarity in the investment industry and among individual investors. Baker wrote that the rule could reduce investment services that people rely on, and could harm the business model for broker-dealers. He said Galvin's rule could also disrupt the state Division of Insurance's regulation of annuities and discourage brokers from selling municipal bonds directly to investors. Galvin also received criticism about the rule from representatives of financial companies and business groups during a public hearing on Tuesday at the State House. — JON CHESTO
TECHNOLOGY
Waltham maker of weapons-screening systems has a new CEO
Evolv Technology, a Waltham-based maker of weapons-screening systems, said Wednesday that it named Peter George as chief executive officer, succeeding co-founder Mike Ellenbogen, who will remain at the company and oversee research and development. George, 60, is a veteran tech industry executive in the region who joined the company in February 2019 as chief commercial officer. He most recently served as CEO at empow, a Boston startup that makes data security management systems, and earlier at Fidelis Cybersecurity, a local company that was acquired by General Dynamics. Evolv also said it added another $6 million to the $24 million in Series C financing the company announced in October, bringing total funding to more than $75 million since it was founded in 2013. Finback Investment Partners, former Florida governor Jeb Bush's venture firm, participated in the latest investment. The company's existing investors include Bill Gates, DCVC, General Catalyst Partners, Lux Capital, and SineWave Ventures. Evolv said its systems have screened more than 50 million people for weapons at venues including Lincoln Center, Oakland Airport, Gillette Stadium, and L.L. Bean. — LARRY EDELMAN
HEALTH CARE
Cambridge Health Alliance has a new chief executive
The hospital system Cambridge Health Alliance on Wednesday appointed a longtime physician executive, Dr. Assaad Sayah, as its new chief executive. Sayah has been serving as interim CEO since June, following the retirement of Patrick Wardell. He has been chief medical officer at Cambridge Health Alliance since 2013, and before that was chief of emergency medicine and senior vice president of primary care. Sayah, 58, previously worked at other Boston-area hospitals, including Brigham and Women's. Cambridge Health Alliance, which has campuses in Cambridge, Somerville, and Everett, said Wednesday that its board selected Sayah from a pool of 150 applicants. The Harvard-affiliated community health system has been in the headlines after the death of Laura Levis, a 34-year-old woman who found a locked door at CHA Somerville Hospital when she arrived early one morning in 2016, suffering from an asthma attack. She collapsed outside the hospital and later died. — PRIYANKA DAYAL MCCLUSKEY
RETAIL
Macy's closing 28 stores, including one in Leominster
Macy's is closing 28 stores, including one in Leominster, as well as one Bloomingdale's in coming weeks, though the company reported some improvement in comparable-stores sales during the crucial holiday shopping season. Macy's sales at stores opened at least a year fell 0.6 percent during the November and December period, which was not as bad as most industry analysts had anticipated. Like other department stores, Macy's is struggling to adapt to a shift online by customers, and also intense competition from off-price discounters like T.J. Maxx. Macy's has pursued a number of strategies as a way to get shoppers back. That includes expanding an off-price concept at its Macy's stores called Backstage. It also recently teamed up with resale site ThredUp. The company's Bloomingdale's division has recently launched a clothing rental service. — ASSOCIATED PRESS
ECONOMY
Businesses added 202,000 jobs in December
US companies added 202,000 jobs in December, led by robust hiring in construction, trade, transportation and utilities, according to a private survey. Payroll processor ADP said Wednesday that the bulk of the hiring was among smaller and mid-sized businesses with fewer than 500 employees. Hiring in November was also revised upward to 124,000, a sign that the job market was stronger than past surveys initially suggested. — ASSOCIATED PRESS
STARTUPS
Fitness class subscription business is now a unicorn
ClassPass is now worth more than $1 billion, after raising new cash from investors, the startup said on Wednesday. The latest funding marks the fitness class subscription app's entry into the unicorn club of startups, as fitness companies titillate investors. The New York-based company, which lets users take classes across multiple boutique fitness studios and gyms without purchasing memberships at those locations, raised $285 million led by L Catterton and Apax Digital. — BLOOMBERG NEWS
STREAMING
Spotify developing several daily sports shows
Spotify is developing several daily sports shows, a big part of the music-streaming giant's push into original podcasts, according to people familiar with the plans. One program will be a recap of the day in sports and run about 10 minutes, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the projects are still being developed. It's considering a number of options, including audio programs tailored to fans of specific teams. The company has already had success with original daily podcasts in true crime and horoscopes. — BLOOMBERG NEWS
ENTERTAINMENT
The movie business not expected to be as robust in 2020
Movie ticket sales are expected to fall again in 2020 without the full force of the Avengers to save them. After a year marked by Walt Disney Co. hits, including the biggest animated release ever in “Frozen II," a Star Wars trilogy finale, and an Avengers flick that ranks as the best-selling film of all time, 2020 will feel like a hangover, according to box-office analysts. While the year will certainly have some blockbusters, including a live-action version of “Mulan" and the Marvel installment “Black Widow," the slate doesn't include the large volume of highly anticipated franchise features that marked 2019. — BLOOMBERG NEWS

Texto completo: A new Netflix documentary series follows competitive cheerleaders. And a recent documentary about Luciano Pavarotti airs on Showtime.
What's Streaming
CHEER Stream on Netflix. In the series "Last Chance U," the director Greg Whiteley captured junior-college football on and off the field, mixing sports documentary wins and defeats with personal portraits of players. In this new series, Whiteley turns his attention to cheerleading. "Cheer" focuses on the competitive squad at Navarro College in Corsicana, Tex. The season builds toward a big competition -- but, as with "Last Chance U," its heart is set less on the question of whether the team will win or lose and more on the players, whose personal lives and emotions rush to the surface as they chase athletic perfection. "The way that we prepare, you keep going until you get it right," the team's coach, Monica Aldama, says in the first episode. "And then you keep going until you can't get it wrong."
IMMORTAL BELOVED (1994) Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. This year is the 250th anniversary of the birth of Beethoven. One way to celebrate could be to revisit this biographical drama, in which Gary Oldman plays that composer. The film, directed by Bernard Rose, frames its plot around attempts by one of Beethoven's early biographers, Anton Schindler (played by Jeroen Krabbé), to determine the identity of the "immortal beloved" that Beethoven once addressed a love letter to. "Think of this as an extremely ambitious classical music video, with visual ideas that merely echo the moods of the music." Janet Maslin wrote in her review for The New York Times. She also wrote that Beethoven is "dazzlingly impersonated" by Oldman.
What's on TV
PAVAROTTI (2019) 8 p.m. on Showtime. For a music luminary doubleheader, pair "Immortal Beloved" with this documentary about the opera singer Luciano Pavarotti, directed by Ron Howard. The film mixes archival footage, audio recordings and interviews (including with other musicians like José Carreras, Bono and Lang Lang) to appraise his career, which brought him success both inside the realm of traditional opera and outside of it. "The importance of the new documentary, the opportunity it provides," Zachary Woolfe wrote in an article in The Times last year, "is to make us reckon with these two Pavarottis as one, and in doing so to recognize a side of opera that many of us who love it as high art like to ignore. The vulgar side, the trashy, the elemental, the baldly populist -- the side never better embodied than by this hulking, sweaty man with stringy hair, a patchy beard and an unforgettable sound."
BAD BOYS (1995) and BAD BOYS II (2003) 5:30 p.m. and 8 p.m. on USA Network. Will Smith and Martin Lawrence are set to return as a Miami crime-fighting duo in "Bad Boys for Life," out next week. Its impending release is a good excuse to rewatch these first two movies in the "Bad Boys" series -- though the new movie will be missing Michael Bay, who directed the original pair. Whether the new movie's directors, Bilall Fallah and Adil El Arbi, can successfully carry Bay's torch (or detonator) remains to be seen.

Texto completo: Also this week, wildfires in Australia
Welcome to the Climate Fwd: newsletter. The New York Times climate team emails readers once a week with stories and insights about climate change. Sign up here to get it in your inbox. (And find the website version of this week's letter here .)
When we make a mess in the kitchen, many of us reach for paper towels without sparing a thought for where those crisp white sheets originated.
If you're in North America, some of the fiber in your paper towels (and other tissue products like toilet paper) probably started off as a tree in the boreal forest of northern Canada, one of the last big, intact forests in the world.
Boreal forests stretch across Canada, Alaska, Siberia and Northern Europe, and, together, they form a giant reservoir that stores carbon dioxide. That's important, because that carbon would otherwise be released into the atmosphere and contribute to global warming. Collectively, boreal forests lock away about 703 gigatons of carbon in woody fibers and soil. Tropical forests, by comparison, store about 375 gigatons of carbon.
These are tough times for forests, though. Because of climate change, they're highly susceptible to wildfires, like the ones in Australia, and pest infestations. So, anything we can do to keep them intact is good.
Trevor Hesselink, director of policy and research at the Wildlands League, a Canadian conservation organization, said it's important to weigh the value of paper products against the value of intact forests. "If you are thinking through a carbon lens, those single-use products are very short-lived," he said.
Canada is generally seen as being good at forest management. In logged areas of the boreal forest, trees are replanted and allowed to regenerate, and the country boasts a very low official deforestation rate of just 0.02 percent (though that has been disputed by some environmental groups).
The bad news is, even if actual deforestation is low, planting a young tree to replace a mature one is not the one-for-one carbon scenario many people imagine, Mr. Hesselink said.
For a long time, scientists believed older trees stopped absorbing carbon as they aged. But recently, researchers have that found older trees continue absorbing carbon dioxide for decades or even centuries longer than originally thought, said William Moomaw, a physical chemist and lead author on five Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports.
Leaving existing forests to grow will be more effective at mitigating climate change over the next 80 years than reforestation or planting new forests, Dr. Moomaw and his colleagues have said. A tree planted this year won't make much of a difference in terms of carbon sequestration over the next decade, a period many scientists say is critical for climate action. "They just don't absorb enough carbon dioxide," Dr. Moomaw said. "They aren't big enough."
Furthermore, boreal forests support a diverse array of plant and animal species. They're also central to life for hundreds of indigenous groups.
There is some debate over the degree to which pulp and paper products, like the disposable towels in your kitchen, drive logging activity in the boreal forest.
Tony Lemprière, senior manager of climate change policy in the Canadian Forest Service, pointed out that industry can use waste from timber production to make paper products. But the Natural Resources Defense Council estimates that 44 percent of the pulp produced in Ontario comes from whole trees rather than byproduct.
Regardless, it's easy to reduce the amount of single-use paper products you buy.
Reusable cloth towels are a great alternative, said Shelley Vinyard, who heads the boreal forest program at the Natural Resources Defense Council. For those moments when you really do need a paper towel, she recommends one made of recycled content. The council's consumer guide has recommendations for paper towels, toilet paper and facial tissues.
We really need to be thinking about forests in a different way at this "critical junction," Mr. Hesselink said. Instead of soaking up spilled milk, those trees can help us tackle a much larger mess.
Intense fires have been burning across southeastern Australia for months, encroaching on major cities, threatening popular tourist destinations and scorching forests that are home to millions of animals.
The state of New South Wales, which includes Sydney, the country's largest city, is experiencing its worst fire season in at least 20 years. More than 12 million acres of land have burned across the state since September, according to the Rural Fire Service, an area about the size of Vermont and New Hampshire combined. Also hard-hit has been the state of Victoria.
This year's fire season started early and has been disastrous, experts said, even for a country accustomed to burning. Wildfires have ravaged areas much closer to the densely populated southeast coast than in previous years.
The fires have been fueled by years of drought, record-breaking temperatures and strong winds.
Government records made public shortly after the New Year confirmed that 2019 was the country's hottest and driest year on record. The map above, based on data from the Australian Government Bureau of Meteorology, shows record-low rainfall across large swaths of southeastern Australia over the past three years.
Crystal A. Kolden, a wildfire scientist at the University of Idaho, said those conditions were "fully consistent" with the extremes expected in the era of global warming. In our interactive feature tracking the fires, she called the blazes both "a harbinger of what is to come" and a signal that we're already feeling some of the effects of climate change.
You can read the full article here. We'll be updating it regularly.
You might have seen my article this week about marine labs and climate change. It's a story three years in the making.
In January 2017, I was in Louisiana to investigate the effects of climate change on the Gulf Coast. It's a topic I've been writing about for nearly 15 years. (I like to joke that some of my colleagues have been to all 50 states; I've been to one state 50 times.)
At a public meeting sponsored by the state Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority, I met Alex Kolker, a researcher who studies coastal land loss. He invited me to visit him at his lab at the Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium down in Cocodrie, a speck of a place at the end of Louisiana State Highway 56, where spiffy vacation homes and battered trailers perch on pillars that elevate them 12 feet or more above the ground to get through hurricane flooding. I had some flexibility in my schedule, so I drove down the next day.
When I got there, the building was dark. I made my way up to the second floor and found Dr. Kolker's office. He explained that the power had been flickering for days and, with a boom, had just gone out. It was inconvenient, but with a hazardous edge: computers and equipment that run experiments are endangered by blackouts.
We walked out to the parking lot, where workers had removed an access panel in the ground and were looking down into a junction box with electrical lines running through it. The junction box was full of water.
The rising waters, a hallmark of climate change, had done their work. And that sounded like the kernel of a story to me: a science facility built like a fortress against hurricanes was under attacked from climate change on a separate front.
After my visit, I went back to work on a major project on climate change and South Louisiana with my colleague Kevin Sack and journalists from the New Orleans Times-Picayune. Dr. Kolker and his lab were not a part of that project, but I held on to my precious nugget of a story.
A few months ago, he got back in touch and asked whether I'd be interested in heading back down to his lab. I was, and I did. You can read the article here, complete with video of a swarm of fiddler crabs.
If climate change is stopping the people who study climate change from doing their work, well, that's a problem for us all.

Texto completo: Writers discuss the attack on American air bases and the speech by President Trump.
To the Editor:
Re "Trump Backs Away From Further Military Conflict With Iran" (nytimes.com, Jan. 8):
Iran could have reacted two ways to the assassination of Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani. It could have bombed the hell out of us, killing hundreds of Americans. That would have forced America to respond in kind, and the end result would have been the feared war that nobody wanted. Or the Iranians could phone in a warning and then lob a bunch of low-rent missiles into an unoccupied part of two Iraqi bases. Obviously, that's the option it chose.
The president killed General Suleimani for two reasons: because President Barack Obama wouldn't, and because he knew it would take the emphasis off his impeachment trial and bolster his ratings with his followers. The schoolyard bully poked and prodded a hostile enemy until it responded, then made up a story about pending terrorist attacks and his awesome response to the threat.
As a former military member, I cried when I heard about the attacks on our bases. I thought of all those young American men and women who were going to die in the name of Donald Trump's maniacal bravado. Then I realized that Iran didn't target the Americans; it targeted Mr. Trump's ego. And in the process both sides got what they wanted.
Iran won't get an ill-fated U.S. attack on its critical infrastructure. Mr. Trump hopes this boosts his chances of getting re-elected by followers who honestly think he saved us from Iranian terrorism.

To the Editor:
I am thankful that at least for now, President Trump seems to be backing off from engaging in further provocation of our implacable foe, Iran. Obviously, some reasonable individual has gotten through to him that to continue the dangerous game of tit for tat could be ruinous to our country and our allies.
Mr. Trump's incompetence and impetuousness brought about the assassination of one of the most revered and powerful individuals in Iran. The world has been ridden of an evil and bloodthirsty man, but at what cost? It would be reasonable to expect that Iran and its network of proxies would respond with vengeance, and we have seen the outrage of millions of its people in the streets since the killing.
If we are able to emerge from this with no loss of life or limb by our soldiers and civilians, which seems to be the case as I write this, we should consider ourselves lucky. Let us hope that this is not simply the calm before the storm.
Oren Spiegler

To the Editor:
"Long Before President's Drone Strike, Iran Hawks Pushed for the Killing of a General" (news article, Jan. 7) is spot on. The assassination of Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani was utterly brilliant, in conception and in execution. General Suleimani had the blood of numerous victims on his hands.
I'm appalled that the Democrats can't see that the swing voters whom they need in order to beat President Trump won't respond well to criticism of the assassination. They are so full of disdain for Mr. Trump that they are helping him to be re-elected rather than agree with anything he does.
Those of us who really dislike Mr. Trump should check if we are forming our opinion of General Suleimani's killing because of our antipathy for the president. If Barack Obama had authorized the killing of General Suleimani, as he did for Osama bin Laden, what would we say?
Gilad Stern
Cape Town
To the Editor:
Re "The Day After War Begins in Iran," by Azadeh Moaveni (Op-Ed, nytimes.com, Jan. 6):
I thank Ms. Moaveni for her thoughtful perspective and insights. I'm of the generation that had the privilege to attend an American university during the 1960s along with quite a few Iranian students, and to work weekends at a restaurant with several of them who, like me, needed a bit of income to keep body and soul together.
They were wonderful young people, and that very positive experience is a vivid memory. It stimulated a lifelong interest in Iran and its peoples. Now, in my declining years, and with these recent events, I am saddened to realize that I am unlikely to ever be able to visit their country and learn more about their culture.
Could our two countries do what is needed to heal our differences and return to a state of mutual respect and appreciation? I sincerely hope so.

Texto completo: The online magazine deleted a glowing story about Facebook after questions were raised about whether it was an ad.
On Wednesday, Teen Vogue published an article on Facebook's efforts to safeguard political speech. It had no byline and a glowing tone.
Not long after it was posted, a line appeared, in italics, at the top of the story to signal that it was a paid advertisement: "Editor's note: This is sponsored editorial content."
Soon after, the "sponsored editorial content" label disappeared. And then, the article itself vanished.
Under the headline "How Facebook Is Helping Ensure the Integrity of the 2020 Election," the lengthy Teen Vogue post included question-and-answer-style interviews with five female Facebook managers who said the platform was taking steps to avoid spreading misinformation and propaganda as another presidential election drew near. The article also included a portrait of the women.
"We're a different company than we were in 2016," Katie Harbath, Facebook's director of global elections, was quoted as saying. "Including when it comes to elections."
Condé Nast, the owner of Teen Vogue, said in a statement, "We made a series of errors labeling this piece, and we apologize for any confusion this may have caused. We don't take our audience's trust for granted, and ultimately decided that the piece should be taken down entirely to avoid further confusion."
A Condé Nast employee with knowledge of the arrangement, who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly, said the article had indeed been commissioned as sponsored content, meaning it was an ad.
Facebook pitched the idea for the article last year, when the social media network and the online magazine were in talks about the Teen Vogue Summit, a three-day event that took place in Los Angeles in November, with speakers including the YouTube star Liza Koshy and the film director Greta Gerwig. Facebook was a sponsor of the gathering.
"We had a paid partnership with Teen Vogue related to their women's summit, which included sponsored content," Facebook said in a statement. "Our team understood this story was purely editorial, but there was a misunderstanding."
Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook's chief operating officer, and other executives at the company shared the Teen Vogue story Wednesday morning, before it went into the digital ether.
"Great Teen Vogue piece about five incredible women protecting elections on Facebook," Ms. Sandberg wrote on her Facebook page. The post went on to plug the company's attempts to "stop the spread of misinformation" and "fight foreign interference and voter suppression."
Phillip Picardi, Teen Vogue's former chief content officer, was one of the article's critics. "I am so sorry to the @TeenVogue team for whatever irresponsible sales or marketing staff pushed this article into their feed, therefore discrediting all the GOOD work they've been doing to educate their audience about the REAL threats posed by @Facebook in our election," he wrote on Twitter.
As the debate about the article made Teen Vogue a trending topic on Twitter, another online critic linked to the article and posed the question, "What is this Teen Vogue?" To that, the verified Teen Vogue account replied in a tweet that was later deleted: "literally idk."
Facebook has struggled to shore up its reputation after a three-year string of debacles related to its handling of election interference and data privacy. Lawmakers and civil rights groups have warned that the company seems unprepared to counter the disinformation campaigns that clogged social media during the last presidential campaign.
This week, a 2,500-word internal post by a Facebook executive, Andrew Bosworth, set off discord at the company. In his post, which was obtained by The New York Times, he warned against the temptation to skew the platform against President Trump's 2020 re-election campaign and stood by the company's stance on not censoring politicians' posts.
Teen Vogue started in 2003 as a pet project of Anna Wintour, the longtime editor in chief of Vogue and Condé Nast's artistic director. In 2017, as the magazine gained attention for adding articles on politics and social issues to its mix, Condé Nast shut down the print edition.
On Wednesday, the Teen Vogue home page included serious fare like "No to War With Iran" alongside lifestyle articles headlined "How to Tell Your Crush You Like Them" and "The Best Under $ 100 Bags to Shop From Coach's Major Winter Sale."
For now, anyone clicking on the link to Teen Vogue's Facebook article is met with this message: "Uh-Oh. Unfortunately this page does not exist."
Kevin Roose contributed reporting.

Texto completo: President Trump addressed the nation from the White House on Wednesday about the conflict with Iran.
Surrounded by his top advisers and military officials, Mr. Trump said, "The United States is ready to embrace peace with all who seek it."
The following is the complete transcript of Mr. Trump's remarks, as prepared by The New York Times.
PRESIDENT TRUMP: As long as I'm president of the United States, Iran will never be allowed to have a nuclear weapon. Good morning. I'm pleased to inform you the American people should be extremely grateful and happy. No Americans were harmed in last night's attack by the Iranian regime. We suffered no casualties. All of our soldiers are safe, and only minimal damage was sustained at our military bases. Our great American forces are prepared for anything.
Iran appears to be standing down, which is a good thing for all parties concerned and a very good thing for the world. No American or Iraqi lives were lost because of the precautions taken, the dispersal of forces and an early warning system that worked very well.
I salute the incredible skill and courage of America's men and women in uniform. For far too long, all the way back to 1979, to be exact, nations have tolerated Iran's destructive and destabilizing behavior in the Middle East and beyond. Those days are over. Iran has been the leading sponsor of terrorism, and their pursuit of nuclear weapons threatens the civilized world. We will never let that happen. Last week, we took decisive action to stop a ruthless terrorist from threatening American lives. At my direction, the United States military eliminated the world's top terrorist, Qassim Suleimani.
As the head of the Quds Force, Suleimani was personally responsible for some of the absolutely worst atrocities. He trained terrorist armies, including Hezbollah, launching terrorist strikes against civilian targets. He fueled bloody civil wars all across the region. He viciously wounded and murdered thousands of U.S. troops, including the planting of roadside bombs that maim and dismember their victims. Soleimani directed the recent attacks on U.S. personnel in Iraq that badly wounded four service members and killed one American, and he orchestrated the violent assault on the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad. In recent days he was planning new attacks on American targets, but we stopped him.
Suleimani's hands were drenched in both American and Iranian blood. He should have been terminated long ago. By removing Suleimani, we have sent a powerful message to terrorists. If you value your own life, you will not threaten the lives of our people. As we continue to evaluate options in response to Iranian aggression, the United States will immediately impose additional punishing economic sanctions on the Iranian regime. These powerful sanctions will remain until Iran changes its behavior. In recent months alone, Iran has seized ships in international waters, fired an unprovoked strike on Saudi Arabia and shot down two U.S. drones. Iran's hostilities substantially increased after the foolish Iran nuclear deal was signed in 2013, and they were given $ 150 billion, not to mention $ 1.8 billion in cash.
Instead of saying thank you to the United States, they chanted, "Death to America." In fact, they chanted, "Death to America," the day the agreement was signed. Then Iran went on a terror spree, funded by the money from the deal, and created hell in Yemen, Syria, Lebanon, Afghanistan and Iraq. The missiles fired last night at us and our allies were paid for with the funds made available by the last administration. The regime also greatly tightened the reins on their own country, even recently killing 1,500 people at the many protests that are taking place all throughout Iran.
The very defective J.C.P.O.A. expires shortly anyway and gives Iran a clear and quick path to nuclear breakout. Iran must abandon its nuclear ambitions and end its support for terrorism. The time has come for the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Russia and China to recognize this reality. They must now break away from the remnants of the Iran deal, or J.C.P.O.A., and we must all work together toward making a deal with Iran that makes the world a safer and more peaceful place. We must also make a deal that allows Iran to thrive and prosper and take advantage of its enormous untapped potential.
Iran can be a great country. Peace and stability cannot prevail in the Middle East as long as Iran continues to foment violence, unrest, hatred and war. The civilized world must send a clear and unified message to the Iranian regime: Your campaign of terror, murder, mayhem will not be tolerated any longer. It will not be allowed to go forward.
Today, I am going to ask NATO to become much more involved in the Middle East process. Over the last three years, under my leadership, our economy is stronger than ever before and America has achieved energy independence. These historic accomplishments changed our strategic priorities. These are accomplishments that nobody thought were possible. And options in the Middle East became available.
We are now the No. 1 producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world. We are independent, and we do not need Middle East oil. The American military has been completely rebuilt under my administration at a cost of $ 2.5 trillion. U.S. armed forces are stronger than ever before. Our missiles are big, powerful, accurate, lethal and fast. Under construction are many hypersonic missiles. The fact that we have this great military and equipment, however, does not mean we have to use it. We do not want to use it. American strength, both military and economic, is the best deterrent.
Three months ago, after destroying 100 percent of ISIS and its territorial caliphate, we killed the savage leader of ISIS, al-Baghdadi, who was responsible for so much death, including the mass beheadings of Christians, Muslims and all who stood in his way. He was a monster. Al-Baghdadi was trying again to rebuild the ISIS caliphate and failed. Tens of thousands of ISIS fighters have been killed or captured during my administration. ISIS is a natural enemy of Iran. The destruction of ISIS is good for Iran. And we should work together on this and other shared priorities.
Finally, to the people and leaders of Iran, we want you to have a future and a great future, one that you deserve. One of prosperity at home and harmony with the nations of the world. The United States is ready to embrace peace with all who seek it. I want to thank you, and God bless America. Thank you very much.

Texto completo: Many potential jurors in his rape case want to be excused, saying their knowledge of the accusations could affect their judgment.
One potential juror said she had a friend who had "an encounter" with the film producer Harvey Weinstein, without giving details.
Two others said they had read Ronan Farrow's book, "Catch and Kill: Lies, Spies, and a Conspiracy to Protect Predators," which detailed the challenges he faced in reporting on sexual misconduct allegations against Mr. Weinstein.
Another woman said she could not be fair because she had been sexually assaulted. A fifth said they had a connection to one of Mr. Weinstein's ex-wives and asked to be excused.
As jury selection in Mr. Weinstein's rape trial entered its second day, it became clear that the pervasive media coverage of the allegations against Mr. Weinstein was making it difficult to find jurors who do not already have strong opinions about his guilt or innocence and could judge the evidence fairly.
Since 2017, more than 90 women have come forward to make public complaints about Mr. Weinstein, with allegations ranging from sexual harassment and unwanted touching to sexual assault and rape. The accounts have appeared in hundreds of news stories, dozens of magazine pieces and at least two books.
The New York Times and The New Yorker won Pulitzer Prizes for their reporting on the allegations against Mr. Weinstein, which set in motion a global movement, known as #MeToo, that has resulted in dozens of powerful men being fired for sexual misconduct.
Mr. Weinstein's lawyers noted in court this week that on Monday an additional 400 news stories were published after new rape and sexual assault charges were filed against Mr. Weinstein in Los Angeles.
Despite the avalanche of news accounts, prosecutors and defense lawyers are trying to find 12 jurors and six alternates in Manhattan who can put aside what they have read or heard about Mr. Weinstein and judge the case solely on the evidence introduced in the courtroom.
On Wednesday, 120 people were brought into State Supreme Court in Manhattan as potential jurors.
"The name of the case which is about to be tried here is 'The People of the State of New York Against Harvey Weinstein,"' Justice James M. Burke told the prospective panelists. One man immediately dropped his chin to his chest in a gesture of disappointment after learning which case it was. (He later told the judge he could not be fair in the case.)
The judge then asked the lawyers and Mr. Weinstein to stand and greet the people in the courtroom. When the movie producer stood -- slightly hunched because of a recent back injury -- one woman in a back row rolled her eyes. Others craned their necks to get a look at the infamous producer.
Justice Burke acknowledged that it was likely that most of the potential jurors had read about the case, but added they would not be disqualified as a result. He then asked if any of the people in the room felt they could not be fair or impartial to the producer, who is charged with rape, criminal sexual act and predatory sexual assault. By noon, about 45 of the potential jurors had asked to bow out.
"I have a very close friend who had an encounter with the defendant," one young woman told Justice Burke. The woman, who did not give her name, was excused and declined to comment about her friend's experience as she left the courtroom.
Another woman, who indicated she had just finished reading Mr. Farrow's book, said, "I don't think I would be fair."
More people raised their hands to speak. One woman said, "I've been assaulted in my past. I can't be fair."
A man was dismissed after he said he had worked with the journalists who had broken the initial stories on the producer's alleged sexual misconduct.
The jury selection for the trial is being done in stages. Justice Burke has brought in panels of 120 people each day, weeding out jurors who clearly have their minds made up or who have scheduling conflicts. He has asked the remaining potential jurors to fill out questionnaires about themselves and return next week.
The judge, prosecutors and defense lawyers will use the questionnaires to further whittle down the potential jurors into a much smaller pool.
Then the formal process of empaneling a jury will begin on Jan. 16. The seats in the jury box will be filled through a random lottery, and the jurors will be questioned more closely in open court by prosecutors and defense lawyers. Both sides will then have a chance to strike some individual jurors from the panel for no stated reason. They may also ask the judge to remove a juror if they can make an argument that the juror cannot be fair.
Mr. Weinstein is accused of raping one woman in a Manhattan hotel in 2013 and forcing oral sex on a second woman in his Tribeca apartment in 2006. Prosecutors plan to call four other women to testify about their allegations that he sexually assaulted them in the past.
Mr. Weinstein's lawyers have argued his encounters with the women were consensual.
On Wednesday, the producer's lawyers also filed a motion asking Justice Burke to recuse himself from the case. The motion argued that the judge was biased, citing his threat on Tuesday to throw Mr. Weinstein in jail for using his cellphones in court.
The judge asked Mr. Weinstein, "Is this really the way that you want to end up in jail for the rest of your life, by texting and violating a court order?"
Arthur Aidala, one of Mr. Weinstein's lawyers, said the judge's comments were "so inflammatory, biased and prejudicial that they have virtually gone viral."
He added: "It has become clear to Mr. Weinstein that the court has already violated its own mandate to the potential jurors by deciding that Mr. Weinstein is guilty before it has heard any of the trial evidence."
The judge did not immediately rule on the defense motion. Joan Illuzzi-Orbon, the lead prosecutor, said in court that she had no comment because she had yet to read the papers.

Texto completo: The president of the American Federation of Teachers writes that the fight for better teaching and learning conditions in our schools was the big education story of 2019.
To the Editor:
"Year in Education: Stalled Test Scores, Increased College Costs" (news article, Dec. 28) misses what any educator would call the biggest happening in education in 2019: the resurgence of public schooling.
From the fights for better teaching and learning conditions, the issues that were at the core of the teacher strikes in Los Angeles and Chicago, to the renewed calls for funding in state capitals from Austin to Indianapolis to Boston, educators -- supported by parents, students and others -- were on the streets fighting for the public schools our children deserve.
Instead of national politicians singing the praises of a movement to blame teachers, seven presidential candidates spoke about the value of public education in a full-day forum near the end of last year. The constant chorus was not just the fight against a secretary of education who has sought to demonize public education, it was the voice of a nation that has come to value its neighborhood schools.

Texto completo: Known as Daddy-O, he created roadside, streetside and top-of-the-roof attractions in Texas and elsewhere.
Bob Wade, a Texas artist whose 40-foot-long iguana sculpture once perched atop the Lone Star Cafe in Manhattan and whose 63-foot-high saxophone lured patrons to a blues nightclub in Houston, died on Dec. 24 at his home in Austin. He was 76.
His wife, Lisa Wade, said the cause was cardiac arrest.
For more than 40 years, Mr. Wade -- who was known by the nickname Daddy-O -- built whimsical, outsize public art that nodded to Texas's culture of bigness, gaining renown for his uninhibited style but also drawing attention as a serious artist in some circles.
Like most of his creations, his iguana, which he christened Iggy, could not be ignored.
Inspired by a stuffed iguana a friend had brought him from Mexico, Mr. Wade used wire mesh and polyurethane foam to fabricate the work, a ferocious-looking monster with an open, spiky-toothed mouth, knifelike spines running down its back and an impressively large dewlap.
"I know for sure that Texans are fascinated by critters -- all kinds of critters," he said in a 1999 documentary film about his work, "Too High, Too Wide and Too Long: A Texas-Style Road Trip," directed by Karen Dinitz.
In the movie, which follows him around the state to view his artwork, Mr. Wade and friends tow his Iguana Mobile, an Airstream trailer that he customized with a fiberglass iguana's head in front, a tail in back and a saddle on top.
Iggy wound up at the Lone Star, a Texas-themed honky-tonk, in the 1970s after Mr. Wade had shown it at an exhibition in western New York, near Niagara Falls. Impetuously picking up the phone one day at 2 a.m., he called Mort Cooperman, the club's owner, and asked him if he would like to install the sculpture on the roof of the Lone Star building, at Fifth Avenue and 13th Street. Mr. Cooperman said yes, agreeing to pay Mr. Wade $ 1,000 a year for Iggy -- the deal was originally for five years -- and $ 1,000 a year for his bar tab.
"It had this confident, cocky, regal kind of look, derived from all that earlier stuff -- dragons and dinosaurs," Mr. Wade said of the sculpture in an interview with The New York Times in 2010. "In a place like New York, it could hold its own."
It did. Iggy remained in place for most of the 1980s, looming over a banner that proclaimed, "Too Much Ain't Enough," and surviving a lawsuit filed by residents who objected to the sculpture as grotesque. Mr. Wade became a favorite of Mayor Edward I. Koch's.
But when the Lone Star went out of business in 1989, the sculpture was removed, leaving it without a permanent home until the Fort Worth Zoo acquired it in 2010 to promote a new herpetarium there, full of reptiles and amphibians. (Iggy arrived suspended from a helicopter.)
The iguana was Mr. Wade's opening act. There would be many more gigantic, kitschy installations: A sextet of 10-foot-tall dancing frogs and an alligator made of Altoid tins. A New Orleans Saints helmet made largely out of an old Volkswagen. A hog-shaped motorcycle made from salvaged Harley-Davidson parts. A colossal pair of simulated ostrich-skin boots. (They'd fit a cowboy with size 500 feet, he estimated.)
The boots, made of polyurethane foam and supported by steel skeletons, were commissioned by the Washington Project of the Arts; Mr. Wade built them in 1979 in a space near the White House, with swaggering Texas politicians like President Lyndon B. Johnson in mind.
"I said, 'You know, there's always a precedent here in D.C. for these Texas guys blowing in and flouting their boots, so maybe a giant pair of boots would be perfect,"' he told "The Texas Standard," a news radio show, in 2017.
A few years after the boots were disassembled and moved to a mall in San Antonio on three flatbed trucks in 1980, Mr. Wade got a phone call from the mall's manager. A homeless man had found his way into one of the boots and cooked his lunch there. The boot was on fire.
"It was the size of a small apartment, kind of a nice spot, and he was cooking lunch with cans of Sterno, and smoke was emerging from the top of the boots," Mr. Wade said in "Too High, Too Wide and Too Long."
The work, rising 35 feet 3 inches, was certified in 2014 by Guinness World Records as the tallest cowboy boot sculpture in the world.
Robert Schrope Wade was born in Austin on Jan. 6, 1943. His father, Chaffin, was a hotel manager who took his family with him as he moved to various properties around Texas. His mother, Pattie (Womack) Wade, was a department store clerk and a cousin of the cowboy entertainer Roy Rogers.
Bob showed artistic talent as a boy, painting flames on a toy car and then on a Vespa scooter. He loved hot rods, and when he showed up with one at the University of Texas, Austin, where he studied art, a fraternity brother nicknamed him Daddy-O.
After receiving a master's degree in painting from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1966, he was an art instructor at McLennan Community College in Waco, Texas; then director of the experimental art institute at what is now Northwood University in Cedar Hill, a suburb of Dallas; and finally a professor of art at North Texas State University (now the University of North Texas).
Near the end of his time at North Texas State, Mr. Wade created "Bicentennial Map of the U.S.A.," a 300-foot-wide earthwork in Dallas that included miniaturized billboards and skyscrapers, a telephone booth and an Old Faithful-style water fountain from Wyoming. After People magazine wrote about the map, La Biennale Paris, the venerable art fair, asked Mr. Wade to submit a project.
His submission was the "Texas Mobile Home Museum," a 1947 trailer coach that he filled with Texas artifacts: stuffed armadillos, white cowboy boots, a pair of longhorns, a taxidermied two-headed calf and a bucking bronco (mounted upside down).
"We were trying to send this little freak show museum to Paris and blow the minds of the French," Mr. Wade told Alcalde, the alumni magazine of the University of Texas, in 2017. "They loved it."
He won a prize of $ 1,000, but it wasn't enough to cover the costs of bringing the exhibit home, so he left the trailer behind.
Most of his projects were too immense to lug back to Austin -- like the 63-foot-tall blue saxophone that he and a crew made in 1993 for a Houston nightclub, the Billy Blues Bar and Grill.
"The sax is an interesting-looking contraption," Mr. Wade told Roadside America, "and I knew I could probably get away with having all kinds of weirdness."
He used an upside-down Volkswagen Beetle for the bottom curve of the instrument, a surfboard for the reed, hubcaps for the keys and beer kegs for the mouthpiece.
After the nightclub closed, the saxophone was donated in 2013 to the Orange Show Center for Visual Art, a folk art organization in Houston.
Mr. Wade had a second artistic pursuit: creating photo emulsions in which he transferred images of the Southwest from old postcards and photographs onto canvasses, painted and enlarged them. Some of them were exhibited in 1973 at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York.
He married Lisa Sherman. In addition to his wife, he is survived by two daughters, Rachel Wade and Christine Codelli; and three grandchildren. His previous marriage, to Sue Immel, ended in divorce.
Writing in Texas Monthly after Mr. Wade's death, the author W.K. Stratton, recalling an observation by an art critic, Dave Hickey, noted that Mr. Wade's wildly-imagined public installations were reminiscent of extravagant homecoming parade floats.
"Bob's sculptures and paintings are taken seriously by his peers," Mr. Stratton wrote, "yet they are also as much fun as any parade. His fans include legions who have never read a word of art criticism or set foot in a gallery. That was fine by Bob."
A worker admired Bob Wade's iguana sculpture in 1997 when it was being moved. For years it sat atop the Lone Star Cafe in Manhattan, until the club closed in 1989.

Texto completo: The plan, running out of money, wants to take the rare step of cutting benefits that have already been earned.
The largest musicians' pension plan in the United States is seeking to cut retirement benefits that have already been earned by thousands of musicians, in an effort to keep the plan from running out of money.
The plan, the American Federation of Musicians and Employers' Pension Fund -- which covers more than 50,000 people, including Broadway musicians, players in some orchestras, and freelance musicians and recording artists -- declared over the summer that it was in "critical and declining status" and would run out of money to pay benefits within 20 years.
The fund calculated that it had, as of last March, roughly $ 1.8 billion in assets and $ 3 billion in projected liabilities -- a severe shortfall. Now its trustees are taking the rare step of trying to cut benefits that have already been earned by many of the plan's participants.
"We faced two challenging options -- to allow the plan to run out of money within 20 years or try to prevent that from happening by applying to the government for approval to reduce earned benefits," plan officials wrote in an email to participants on Tuesday. The email said that if the plan did nothing and ran out of money, the federal government's insurer, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, would likely step in and pay retirees even less than the new proposal calls for.
Under the proposal that the plan filed with the Treasury Department late last month and shared with members on Tuesday, more than half the plan's participants would see no reduction in their benefits; about 45 percent would see their retirement benefits reduced by up to 19 percent of what they have been promised; and a little under 2 percent would have their benefits cut by 20 to 40 percent. Benefits would not be cut for retirees over 80, and cuts would be reduced for those over 75.
If approved, the cuts would go into effect next year.
Several musicians expressed concern about the proposed cuts. Adam Krauthamer, the president of the union's largest local, Local 802 in New York, said in an email to The New York Times that it was "a tough day for unionism, for the A.F.M. and for my fellow musicians across the country."
The executive board of Local 802 wrote in an email to its members that many musicians "will be severely impacted by the impending cuts." Officials at the local pledged to scrutinize the proposed cuts and the application process; work to help Broadway musicians implement a new 401(k) plan to help them prepare for retirement; and push for more accountability from the pension fund and the board of trustees that oversees it.
The American Federation of Musicians, both nationally and among its local chapters, has been pushing for federal legislation to help address the growing national problem of underfunded multiemployer pension plans. But there have been few signs of action in Washington.
The underfunded musicians' plan and the prospect of benefit cuts have roiled the union in recent years. Mr. Krauthamer was an insurgent candidate who was elected president of Local 802 in 2018 in a major upset that was driven largely by concerns about the plan. Some musicians have sued the plan's trustees, claiming mismanagement of the fund, which the trustees have denied. Many rank and file musicians are becoming activists when it comes to their pensions.
A number of factors have contributed to the fund's shortfall, plan officials and musicians said. It enacted a series of expensive benefit increases before 2000, and then suffered major losses in the recessions since. It made a series of bad investment decisions in recent years, which are now the subject of the lawsuit brought by the musicians. And the fund now pays out more in benefits to retirees -- whose ranks have swelled -- than it receives in contributions from currently working musicians and employers, draining the fund.
The plan is seeking to cut benefits under a recent federal law, the Multiemployer Pension Reform Act, which was enacted in 2014. The Treasury Department will accept comments on the proposal and has until mid-August to review it. If it approves the plan, the proposed cuts will be put to a vote of the membership. But the law makes it difficult to reject cuts: Such a rejection would require a majority of all the plan's participants, not just a majority of those who vote.
"This means that not voting counts the same as a vote to approve the reduction," the plan noted in its email to members.

Texto completo: General Suleimani is not the only one who harmed civilians.
It was a hot day in June, 30 years ago. I was sweating in a chador, a speck in the black-clad throng of mourners pouring through Tehran for the funeral of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. As the keening crowd surged dangerously toward the grave site, I was lifted off my feet, lost in a heaving mass of humanity.
Then, I was a Middle East correspondent for The Wall Street Journal. My job was to understand and explain why what may have been the largest crowd of mourners ever assembled wept hysterically for a man my readers considered monstrous.
Today, three decades of diplomatic failure later, I watch from afar on cable news as a similar crowd in Iran, this time a deadly one, mourns Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani. I'm not a journalist anymore, so I'm reduced to groaning at the TV when commentators don't help us understand what's going on, but instead confound our understanding by providing incorrect information.
Watching CNN, I howl in frustration when a reporter states that in July 1988 the United States Navy warship Vincennes "accidentally" shot down Iran Air 655, a civilian passenger plane, and that nine months later, General Suleimani arranged the pipe-bombing in San Diego of a vehicle driven by the wife of the Vincennes's commander, Capt. William C. Rogers III. (She survived the blast.)
The CNN reporter implies that this demonstrates how volatile and dangerous General Suleimani was. But the F.B.I. was unable to establish that the bombing of the Rogers vehicle was an act of Iranian terrorism; the case remains open. And the attack on Iran Air 655 by the Vincennes wasn't, in any meaningful sense, accidental -- and it killed 290 people, 66 of them children.
In 1988 I traveled to Iran for the funerals of those 290 civilians. Their bodies had been fished from the water of the Persian Gulf and brought home for burial. My editor called me as I left for Tehran, asking me to consider the possibility that Iran shot down the plane itself, since she thought it odd that the recovered bodies were unclothed. "Did they put naked corpses in that plane before they shot it down?" she asked.
She could be forgiven for not knowing the relevant physics: Clothing would be torn from the passengers' bodies as the exploding plane plummeted from the sky into the sea. It was harder to forgive her cultural unawareness: A state as obsessed with modesty as Iran was -- to the extent of covering every hair on a woman's head and every male kneecap -- would never consider undressing bodies before blowing them up.
Ignorance surrounded -- and still surrounds -- that tragedy. In the immediate aftermath of the downing of Iran Air 655, the United States military's prevarications came thick and fast: The plane wasn't in the civilian air corridor. (It was.) It didn't have its transponder turned on. (It did.) It was descending toward the Vincennes. (It wasn't.)
The truth gradually came out in the course of the Navy's own inquiries and in later investigative reports that revealed a pattern of reckless aggression by the Vincennes captain, beginning a month earlier. David Carlson, the commanding officer of the frigate Sides, which was also deployed then in the gulf, called the downing of the Iranian airliner "the horrifying climax" of that aggressiveness. Just before firing at the plane, Captain Rogers had provoked Iranian gunboats and then followed them into Iran's territorial waters.
Yet the United States later decorated Captain Rogers "for exceptionally meritorious conduct" as commander of the Vincennes during that time. The citation made no mention of the downing of Iran Air 655. How would Americans feel if Iran pinned a medal on a man who killed 290 American civilians?
General Suleimani has American blood on his hands, as we are reminded repeatedly, not only by President Trump but also by Democratic presidential candidates. This is true. But is it wrong to remind ourselves of the Iranian blood we have on ours?
On other reporting trips to Iran, I visited Khorramshahr, a city that had been reduced to rubble by a barrage of shelling by Saddam Hussein, as well as the civilian neighborhoods of Tehran, which had endured a similar barrage. At that time Mr. Hussein was, as the United States ambassador in Baghdad told me, "a guy we can work with." We and Israel secretly provided him with information on how best to target his missile strikes. There, too, civilian Iranian blood was on our hands.
Having witnessed that destruction, I don't find it hard to understand why Iran seeks to build up its missile capability. We would, if in its position. Israel's supporters often note that Israel's military aggression can be excused because it lives in "a bad neighborhood" -- and indeed, it does. But we characterize Iran as "meddling" in Iraq, forgetting or oblivious to the fact that not long ago Iraq posed an existential threat to Iran, which the United States abetted.
General Suleimani killed Americans and, we are told, had plans to kill more. He was a military commander. Military commanders have plans to kill their enemies. And the United States is Iran's enemy, reneging on the nuclear agreement and choking its economy, impoverishing and immiserating civilians who have nothing to do with, and no say in, their government's policy.
Is Iran a brutal, murderous, repressive regime that tramples the rights of women and minorities? No doubt. But so is Saudi Arabia, and we have managed to work with that regime. Iran is just as critical to the long-term stability of the region.
Forty years is a long time for the United States to be without a diplomatic presence in a country, and Iran bears the blame for severing those relations. But the dangerous, disproportionate assassination of General Suleimani may have shut the diplomatic door for many more decades.

Texto completo: Justice Ginsburg, 86, underwent treatment for a malignant tumor that was discovered after a blood test in July.
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, whose health has become a preoccupation of the American public as the Supreme Court hews rightward under President Trump, announced this week that she was cancer-free.
Justice Ginsburg, 86, one of four liberal justices on the nine-member court, told CNN in a wide-ranging interview on Tuesday that treatment for a malignant tumor on her pancreas had been successful.
Her doctors discovered the tumor in July after a routine blood test, and a biopsy at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City confirmed a localized malignant tumor.
"I'm cancer-free," Justice Ginsburg said in the interview, adding that she had resumed an active schedule. "That's good."
A Supreme Court spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday.
This was the fourth time that Justice Ginsburg, who was nominated to the court by President Bill Clinton in 1993, had undergone cancer treatment.
In 2018, surgeons removed two malignant nodules from Justice Ginsburg's left lung and determined that the cancer had not spread. In 2009, she had surgery for early-stage pancreatic cancer, and in 1999 she was treated for colon cancer without missing a day on the bench.
The five-year survival rate for pancreatic cancer that is localized is 37 percent, according to the National Cancer Institute. But many patients don't show symptoms -- which include abdominal pain, jaundice, lack of appetite and weight loss -- until the pancreatic cancer has spread to other organs, according to medical experts.
In 53 percent of pancreatic cancer cases in the United States, the cancer has metastasized to distant organs, which the National Cancer Institute said decreases the five-year survival rate to 2.9 percent.
Justice Ginsburg's health challenges have made Democrats uneasy about another retirement or vacancy on the court while Mr. Trump is president. Since taking office, Mr. Trump has nominated two justices to the nine-member court: Neil M. Gorsuch after the death of Antonin Scalia and Brett M. Kavanaugh to replace Anthony M. Kennedy, who had been considered the swing vote on the court before his retirement in 2018.
Justice Ginsburg, the senior member of the court's four-member liberal wing, is expected to play a key role in a number of landmark cases that are scheduled to come before the court, including a Louisiana abortion law, a Second Amendment case and the push by Democrats in Congress for the release of Mr. Trump's tax and financial records.
Justice Ginsburg has stayed in the public eye during her most recent cancer diagnosis with a series of speaking engagements. There has been a book ("Notorious RBG: The Life and Times of Ruth Bader Ginsburg"), a major motion picture, a documentary and merchandise, including a necklace pendant resembling the collar she wears when writing a dissenting opinion.
In an interview last year with National Public Radio, Justice Ginsburg notably brushed aside skepticism about her health, recalling a comment from a senator long ago.
"There was a senator, I think it was after my pancreatic cancer, who announced with great glee that I was going to be dead within six months," she said. "That senator, whose name I have forgotten, is now himself dead, and I am very much alive."

Texto completo: A psychiatrist is troubled by statements in an Op-Ed article linking anti-Semitic violence to mental health problems.
To the Editor:
Re "How to Combat Anti-Semitic Violence" (Op-Ed, Jan. 2):
As a Jewish American, I appreciated many of Mitchell D. Silber's recommendations for combating anti-Semitic violence. As a psychiatrist, however, I am troubled by some of his statements regarding the role of mental illness in these attacks.
He refers to data he has reviewed showing that "approximately a third of the recent anti-Semitic attacks in New York are committed by people with histories of psychiatric problems." I have not seen Mr. Silber's data, so I don't know what "psychiatric problems" his research has uncovered. However, an abundance of research has found no strong link between having "psychiatric problems" per se and an increased risk of violence. Indeed, individuals with serious mental illness are more often the victims of violent crimes than the perpetrators.
It is therefore unhelpful when Mr. Silber goes on to describe "mental health issues" as a "serious threat." Nevertheless, when serious mental illness (such as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder) goes untreated, the risk of violence does increase, particularly when substance abuse is involved.
For some such individuals, assertive community treatment -- involving a 24/7, multidisciplinary team approach -- may help reduce the potential for violence.

Randi Weingarten: The Resurgence of Public Schools
To the Editor:
"Year in Education: Stalled Test Scores, Increased College Costs" (news article, Dec. 28) misses what any educator would call the biggest happening in education in 2019: the resurgence of public schooling.
From the fights for better teaching and learning conditions, the issues that were at the core of the teacher strikes in Los Angeles and Chicago, to the renewed calls for funding in state capitals from Austin to Indianapolis to Boston, educators -- supported by parents, students and others -- were on the streets fighting for the public schools our children deserve.
Instead of national politicians singing the praises of a movement to blame teachers, seven presidential candidates spoke about the value of public education in a full-day forum near the end of last year. The constant chorus was not just the fight against a secretary of education who has sought to demonize public education, it was the voice of a nation that has come to value its neighborhood schools.

Dealing With Hearing Loss
To the Editor:
Re "For Brain Health, Correct Mild Hearing Loss," by Jane E. Brody (Personal Health, Dec. 31):
As one who has studied hearing-related difficulties for 30 years, I heartily agree that if you suspect hearing loss, don't let vanity ("I'm too young for hearing aids!") or denial ("Everyone is mumbling!") prevent you from seeking appropriate amplification. But realize that managing hearing loss is a journey, one that doesn't end with the purchase of hearing aids.
Here are the guidelines I recommend to my patients:
Understand that it takes time and concerted effort to adapt to hearing aids; it doesn't happen overnight. Engage in regular conversation, even if doing so is daunting, because social isolation leads to a downward emotional and cognitive spiral.
Exercise your auditory brain skills through structured listening practice. Maintain contact with others who have hearing loss, either in person or through social media, because you'll benefit from their empathy and support.
Get an online coach who is a hearing professional. The more you learn about conversational strategies, the easier it will be to overcome your communication challenges.

Texto completo: The crash of a Ukrainian Boeing 737-800 reverberated around the world. Canada alone lost at least 63 people.
MONTREAL -- There was the family of a prominent Iranian writer who had emigrated to Canada a few years ago. There was a newlywed couple. And there were international students and children.
The victims of a crash on Wednesday morning of a Boeing 737-800 included passengers and crew members from at least seven countries, among them at least 63 Canadians.
It is unclear what caused the crash.
Ukrainian International Airlines Flight 752 went down amid tensions between the United States and Iran over the American drone strike last week that killed Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, the leader of Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps. Early Wednesday, Iran attacked two bases in Iraq that house United States troops.
The plane was bound for Kyiv and crashed shortly after taking off from Tehran. All 176 people on board were killed.
Vadym Prystaiko, Ukraine's minister of foreign affairs, said the victims included 82 Iranians and 11 Ukrainians, including nine Ukrainian crew members. Sixty-three passengers were from Canada, 10 from Sweden, four from Afghanistan, three from Germany and three from Britain, he said.
For Canada, the crash was one of the worst losses of life in an aviation disaster. In 1985, a bomb exploded and killed 329 people aboard an Air India flight, most of them Canadians of Indian ancestry.
Canada has one of the world's largest shares of the Iranian diaspora; 210,000 people who identify as Iranian live in the country, and many of them fled their homeland after the 1979 Islamic revolution. Others arrived more recently, often drawn by education or employment opportunities.
Iranian immigrants in Canada live largely in the suburbs of the country's three largest cities: Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver.
Mahsha Alimardani, a doctoral student at Oxford University, wrote on Twitter that the route from Tehran to Toronto through Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital, had become affordable for many Iranian-Canadians who did not have access to direct flights.
Payman Parseyan, an Iranian immigrant in Edmonton, told the CBC, the Canadian broadcaster, that the disaster was "devastating" for the close-knit Iranian community in that city. People were glued to their televisions sets and seeking one another out in search of news about loved ones, he said.
As many as 30 victims came from Edmonton.
Mr. Parseyan said they included two young girls, 9 and 14, as well as international students from Iran.
Reza Akbari, president of the Iranian Heritage Society of Edmonton, told The Edmonton Journal that the victims included doctors as well as a newlywed couple, Arash Pourzarabi, 26, and Pouneh Gorji, 25, computer science students who had traveled to Iran for their wedding.
"It's been a shock," he told the newspaper. "I know some of these people in person. I had a chance to see them at different, parties, gatherings."
"I can tell you pretty much every Iranian in Edmonton knew some of them," Mr. Akbari said. "So it's very devastating."
The crash also took the lives of the wife and daughter of an Iranian author, Hamed Esmaeilion, a dentist celebrated as a leading writer of his generation.
Husband-and-wife engineering professors at the University of Alberta, Mojgan Daneshmand and Pedram Mousavi, and their daughters Daria and Dorina Mousavi, were also killed. The university described Professor Daneshmand as a pioneering researcher in microwave sensors who had been making advances for a variety of products, including wearable health monitors.
In North Vancouver, Arash Azrahimi, owner of Rosewood Photography, said several of the victims had been his customers. Two of them, he said, Mohammadhossein and Zeynab Asadilari, who were in their 20s, were children of a member of the Iranian government and had been living in Vancouver.
Other victims from Vancouver area included a couple -- both of them doctors -- and the wife and daughter of a bakery owner, he said.
Majid Mahichi, a Vancouver-based television producer of a Farsi language program, knew the doctor couple, Firouzeh Madini and Naser Pourshabanoshibi, for 40 years. He said they had gone to Iran to visit their parents and had one daughter, who did not travel with them.
The pair moved to Canada about five years ago, Mr. Mahichi said. "They were a very happy couple," he said. "They were so happy to have moved to Canada."
He said, "We have some friends who just wanted to visit their families -- but now unfortunately, their bodies are coming back."
Laing O'Rourke, a construction company based in Britain, confirmed in an email on Wednesday that Saeed Tahmasebi Khademsadi, 35, who worked at the company office in Dartford, died in the crash. Mr. Tahmasebi, a civil engineer at Laing O'Rourke, was a doctoral candidate at Imperial College in London, according to his LinkedIn page.
Sam Zokaei, a reservoir engineer for BP, was also killed, the company confirmed. Mr. Zokaei, an Arabic and Persian speaker who was on holiday in Iran, had been with BP for the past 14 years, according to his LinkedIn profile.
At a news conference, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada said his government would ensure that the incident was fully investigated. "Canadians have questions, and they deserve answers," he said.
François-Philippe Champagne, Canada's foreign affairs minister, said that he was in touch with the Ukrainian government and that he would keep Canadians informed as the situation became clearer. "Our hearts are with the loved ones of the victims, including many Canadians," he wrote on Twitter.
The Canadian Ministry of Foreign Affairs has warned Canadians to avoid nonessential travel to Iran, citing "the volatile security situation, the regional threat of terrorism and the risk of arbitrary detention."
"Canadians, particularly dual Canadian-Iranian citizens, are at risk of being arbitrarily questioned, arrested and detained," the travel warning says. "Iran does not recognize dual nationality and Canada will not be granted consular access to dual Canadian-Iranian citizens. Canadian-Iranian dual citizens should carefully consider the risks of traveling to Iran."
Transport Canada, the country's transport ministry, said that Air Canada, the only Canadian air carrier that operates in the region, "had altered its routes to ensure the security of its flights into and over the Middle East."

Texto completo: Cybersecurity experts are seeing malicious activity from pro-Iranian forces, and warning that Iran has the capacity to do real damage to American computer systems.
WASHINGTON -- Iran's declaration on Wednesday that a missile attack on Iraq had "concluded proportionate measures" against the United States in response to the killing of its most important general may amplify the Trump administration's attention on computer systems as the next battlefield in its showdown with Tehran.
Cybersecurity experts and government officials are already monitoring an uptick of malicious activity by pro-Iranian hackers and social media users that they believe are harbingers of more serious computer attacks from Tehran, including possible efforts aimed at destroying government databases.
"Iran has the capability and the tendency to launch destructive attacks," said Christopher C. Krebs, the director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, the Department of Homeland Security's computer security arm. "You need to get in the head space that the next breach could be your last."
A battle cloaked in computer systems is more in keeping with Iran's history of attacking the United States and its allies by clandestine means or through proxies. And mischief-making has already begun. In recent days, hackers have defaced government websites and pursued divisive disinformation campaigns on social media. Members of Iran's Miqdad Cyber Base have used official state texting channels to threaten retaliatory strikes on the United States and Israel after the targeted killing of Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani.
The cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike warned customers in an alert obtained by The New York Times that it observed hackers supporting Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps deface local city websites in Minneapolis and Tulsa, Okla., with images honoring General Suleimani. Over the weekend, hackers claiming to be associated with Iran replaced the home page of the Federal Depository Library Program, a division of the Government Publishing Office, with a doctored image of a bloodied President Trump getting punched in the face.
An adviser to Iran's president, Hassan Rouhani, in a series of messages on Twitter, posted a link to Mr. Trump's properties and said: "Our sole problem is Trump. In the event of war, it is he who will bear full responsibility."
The public should be prepared for worse, Mr. Krebs said in an interview. Iran has the ability to not only access private-sector and government computers in the United States, but to "burn down the system," he said.
"This is a capable actor that has demonstrated prior capability in the region," Mr. Krebs said. "They're known to be pretty aggressive."
While most of the activity so far has been limited to anti-Trump threats on social media and government websites, cybersecurity experts have said that true retaliatory attacks could still be coming. A member of a chat group supportive of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps told members to "await a final decision" from Iran's leadership before launching attacks. The hackers of the federal library site included a message with their defacement that warned it was "only a small part of Iran's cyberability."
Former and current government officials predicted that Iran's first method of retaliation would be a physical attack. On Tuesday, Iran fired more than a dozen missiles at two bases housing American troops in Iraq. Mohammad Javad Zarif, Iran's foreign minister, said after the attack that Iran "concluded proportionate measures in self-defense."
Mr. Trump responded on Wednesday by announcing new economic sanctions against Iran. Jamil N. Jaffer, the executive director of the National Security Institute at George Mason University's law school, said the Iranians would not want their next move to provoke a large-scale retaliation from the United States. It could be more difficult for the United States to point to the culprit of an attack on computer systems.
"Conducting terrorists attacks and killing people is binary," Mr. Jaffer said. "On the other hand, cyberattacks can be ratcheted up and down dynamically. As a result, cyberattacks give the Iranians more room in the event they want to engage in a further response."
Tehran's abilities are much more advanced than they were in 2009, when a classified United States intelligence assessment concluded that Iran had the motivation to inflict harm but lacked the skills and resources to do so.
Since then, Iranian hackers used data-destroying malware to target 30,000 computers at Saudi Aramco, the world's largest oil company, destroying Aramco's data, replacing it with the image of a burning American flag and upending the market for computer hard drives as a result. Iranian hackers took American banks offline in 2013 by flooding them with traffic in a so-called denial-of-service attack.
They also destroyed data on thousands of computers at the casino and resort company Las Vegas Sands Corp., after its chief executive, Sheldon G. Adelson, a Republican megadonor, suggested that the United States bomb Iran.
Mr. Krebs hosted a call last Friday with more than 1,700 members of the private sector and state and local governments, encouraging them to back up their data on storage sites not connected to the internet and to alert security personnel to be on the lookout for signs of breaches in their computer systems. While hackers have conducted attacks for ransom, Mr. Krebs warned that future attacks could simply be to cause mayhem.
Mr. Krebs's agency serves mainly to advise private companies and local governments of risks before attacks are launched. While the United States government can assist in the event of a breach, private computer security firms and the companies themselves are expected to be able to handle the initial response and rebuild their networks.
Iranian hackers backed off from such destructive attacks in the lead-up to the signing of the Iran nuclear deal in 2015 and afterward. But Iranian hacking units never ceased; they moved to quieter espionage campaigns, with increasing sophistication.
After Mr. Trump backed out of the Iran nuclear deal in 2018, private security experts and American officials braced for a renewed campaign of Iranian computer warfare. At the time, Gen. Keith B. Alexander, the former director of the National Security Agency, told The Times, "With the nuclear deal ripped up, our nation and our allies should be prepared for what we've seen in the past."
Last year, the Department of Homeland Security grew alarmed by a series of successful hackings on the internet's underlying computer coding, called the Domain Name System. Private researchers at FireEye and other security firms found a connection between the hackers and Iran.
The hackers stole thousands of credentials from telecommunications companies, government agencies and internet infrastructure companies in the United States, Europe and Middle East. Months later, as private researchers noticed an uptick in Iranian hackings, the Department of Homeland Security's cybersecurity division issued a statement warning that Iran was looking to do more than "just steal money and data."
The division released a new advisory on Monday night, warning that "Iran and its proxies and sympathizers" have the ability to conduct disruptive computer attacks, espionage and drone attacks. Customs and Border Protection, another arm of the Department of Homeland Security that employs agents at ports throughout the country, has instructed officers to enhance security.
Over the past year, Iranian hackers have been quietly probing American infrastructure and government networks, according to private researchers and the United States Cyber Command, the Defense Department agency responsible for carrying out attacks on computer systems.
Iranian hackers may use their access to destroy databases, or they may choose to try to gain access to the electricity grid that powers Silicon Valley "as a way of saying, 'You may want to retaliate, but there will be consequences,"' said Suzanne Spaulding, a former under secretary for cybersecurity and critical infrastructure at the Department of Homeland Security. "'We're sitting here with a gun to your head."'
In the past, Iran has used Hezbollah and Hamas for cyberactions, said James A. Lewis, a cybersecurity expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, which gives Iran a degree of deniability should it retaliate with cyberattacks.
It has also had some misfires. In 2016, the Justice Department indicted several Iranian hackers for penetrating the controls of the Bowman Avenue dam in Westchester County, N.Y.
American officials had panicked that the incursion had been at the towering Arthur R. Bowman Dam in Oregon, where a breach could have been catastrophic. Instead, Iranian hackers hit a 20-foot-high structure, where a sudden water release could have flooded the ground floors of some houses, but not much more.
"They didn't have situational awareness to realize they wouldn't have any impact at all," Ms. Spaulding said.

Texto completo: In Beirut, the fugitive ex-Nissan chairman made his first public comments since he fled Japan at news conference and in an interview with The New York Times.
BEIRUT, Lebanon -- It was part corporate presentation, part legal defense, part rambling tirade.
For more than two hours on Wednesday, Carlos Ghosn, the former Nissan executive who fled house arrest in Japan and surfaced in Lebanon last month, launched an impassioned defense of his decision to escape, portraying himself as the victim of a rigged justice system and a corporate coup by disloyal underlings.
By the end of the day, sitting at a conference room table with his wife, Mr. Ghosn seemed less defiant than tired. In an interview with The New York Times, he acknowledged that he had regrets. The biggest: He wished he had retired before everything unraveled.
Mr. Ghosn, who led an auto empire that spanned continents, was arrested in late 2018 and charged with financial wrongdoing. The reporters who gathered to hear him speak at a Beirut news conference had hoped for an account of his daring international escape -- a dash across Japan to a chartered jet that carried him out of the country.
Instead, they were treated to a wide-ranging and sometimes hard-to-follow defense against the charges that Japanese prosecutors had leveled against him. He attacked the authorities in Tokyo as well as executives at Nissan.
Japanese prosecutors responded on Wednesday with a statement issued soon after Mr. Ghosn's conference ended, saying that he had been deemed a flight risk, which "is obvious from the fact that he actually fled and illegally departed from the country."

"His statements during his press conference today failed to justify his acts," the Tokyo prosecutor's office said.
Mr. Ghosn, speaking in English, French and Arabic during the news conference, said he was the victim of "character assassination" and "political persecution."
In the interview with The Times, Mr. Ghosn was mum on the details of his escape, except to say that "there is a lot of imagination" in some media accounts of his brazen flight.
Mr. Ghosn expressed optimism about his future, including the odds that he will be welcomed back into elite company. Since his arrival in Lebanon, he said, a number of prominent organizations, including an Ivy League university, have courted him for possible speaking engagements.
"A lot of people want to get in contact with me," he said.
Below are highlights of Mr. Ghosn's first day speaking to the press about his arrest and escape:
Mr. Ghosn looks toward his 'Mission Impossible.'
As an international fugitive, Mr. Ghosn faces an uncertain future. He is intent on clearing his name, but it is unclear what legal route he could take.
"I am used to what you call Mission Impossible," he said at the news conference, responding to a question from a reporter about whether he will spend the rest of his life as a fugitive. He added: "I would be willing to stand trial anywhere where I think I could have a fair trial."
Mr. Ghosn is a citizen of France, Brazil and Lebanon. Asked whether he would consider going to France, Mr. Ghosn said he was content in Lebanon. "I'm very happy to be here," he said. "I'm with my friends, I'm with my family, my kids can come visit me. I can use the phone, I can use the internet."
In recent days, officials in France have hardened their stance on Mr. Ghosn, calling him a "defendant like any other" and saying he should face justice in a court of law.
He treated the conference as a boardroom.
Mr. Ghosn began his speech as if he were giving a corporate presentation, promising a point-by-point defense and projecting documents onto a screen.
He outlined the minutiae of the case against him and discussed specific emails and statements to prosecutors, complete with a presentation of documents to support his argument. But there was a problem: The text was too small for anyone in the room to read.
He noted that both of his companies had fared worse without him. "By the way, the market cap decrease of Nissan is more than $ 10 billion," he said. "By the way, Renault is not better. ... The market cap of Renault went down by more than $ 5 billion."
"As a shareholder of Nissan, I say, 'Who is protecting me?"' he said.
Nissan 'colluded' with prosecutors, he said.
Mr. Ghosn pushed his theory that his arrest was the work of Nissan executives motivated by the fact that Nissan's performance had begun to decline.
And, he said, the charge of underreporting income isn't one that should have landed him in jail.
Mr. Ghosn has also claimed the charges against him were an effort by Nissan and Japanese officials to prevent a merger with Renault.
Taking questions from reporters, he said that rather than a merger, he had proposed creating a holding company that would have had one board of directors but allowed Nissan and Renault to continue operating as separate companies.
Mr. Ghosn says he was a victim of 'character assassination.'
He defended a lavish party that he held at the Palace of Versailles in 2016 that has been the subject of an investigation by French prosecutors. At question is whether the party was a misuse of company money, because it coincided with Mr. Ghosn's wedding to his second wife, Carole, and with her 50th birthday.
Mr. Ghosn said the party had emerged from a pre-existing relationship between Versailles and the auto alliance.
Still, he said, "obviously this is not a very cheap party."
One of the major public criticisms of Mr. Ghosn has involved houses that reports have said Nissan bought for his benefit. The properties include those in Rio de Janeiro and Beirut.
On Wednesday, Mr. Ghosn argued that the houses had been bought with the assent of top officials at Nissan. He displayed documents that he said showed that Greg Kelly, his onetime lieutenant, and Hiroto Saikawa, his successor as chief executive and one of the company officials he blames for his downfall, had signed off on the purchases.
The criminal charges against Mr. Ghosn in Japan do not include the properties. But Mr. Ghosn said the accusations had been leaked as part of a Nissan smear campaign.
"This is part of the character assassination," he said.
Mr. Ghosn: 'I did not escape justice. I fled injustice.'
Since his arrest, Mr. Ghosn and his family have denounced the Japanese justice system, arguing that he has been a victim of "injustice and political persecution." His comments followed a similar line.
"I have not experienced a moment of freedom since Nov. 19, 2018," he told the room of reporters. "It is impossible to express the depth of the aggravation and my profound appreciation once again to be able to be reunited with my family and loved ones."
Mr. Ghosn defended his decision to flee Japan rather than face trial.
"I did not escape justice. I fled injustice and political persecution," he said. "I was left with no other choice but to protect myself and my family."
Mr. Ghosn also assailed his treatment by prosecutors.
Japanese officials said Mr. Ghosn's claims were false.
Prosecutors in Tokyo issued a long statement on Wednesday saying that Mr. Ghosn's claim of a conspiracy between them and Nissan is "categorically false and completely contrary to fact."
The statement said Mr. Ghosn's treatment reflected the fact that he was a flight risk.
Earlier in the day, the authorities entered the offices of Mr. Ghosn's lawyers in Japan with a search warrant. But the law firm of Junichiro Hironaka, Mr. Ghosn's top lawyer in Japan, said lawyers had kept the authorities from confiscating two computers that Mr. Ghosn had used.
A crush of reporters packed the news conference.
Mr. Ghosn walked with his wife, Carole, into a frenzy of camera operators in a plain white conference room in Beirut, with a burst of flash bulbs going off. Organizers were pleading with the camera operators to back off. A burly, bearded bodyguard stood next to Mr. Ghosn at the lectern.
Before he emerged, more than 100 journalists from across the world had jostled to get inside the conference room at the Lebanese Press Syndicate. A security team checked IDs and bags, and Lebanese reporters interviewed their Japanese counterparts about Mr. Ghosn's escape from Tokyo.
How did Mr. Ghosn escape from Japan?
Mr. Ghosn, 65, a celebrity in Japan and a hero to many in Lebanon, oversaw a turnaround at Nissan starting in the late 1990s and had the rare position of running two major companies simultaneously: Nissan and Renault, based in France.
Born in Brazil and raised in Lebanon, Mr. Ghosnjoined Renault as an executive in the 1990s.
But his career collapsed in late 2018 when he was arrested by the Japanese authorities and later charged with underreporting his compensation and shifting personal financial losses to Nissan. Nissan had also been indicted on charges of improperly reporting Mr. Ghosn's income -- and had said it would cooperate with prosecutors.
Mr. Ghosn was held for more than 100 days, after which he was in and out of jail. He was released after he posted bail and agreed to strict conditions: He could not leave Tokyo, and his movements would be monitored, although he was not required to wear an ankle bracelet.
After he was arrested again in April, prosecutors imposed another condition for his release: Mr. Ghosn was forbidden from communicating with his wife.
No official account of how Mr. Ghosn escaped has emerged yet. But reporting by The Times and the news media in multiple countries has revealed a basic outline of what likely took place.
On the afternoon of Dec. 29, he walked out of his home in Tokyo and took a bullet train to Osaka, about 340 miles southwest of the capital. Then he boarded a corporate jet at Kansai International Airport, hidden inside a box designed for concert equipment. He landed at Istanbul Ataturk Airport, switched planes and flew to Beirut.
When he spoke on Wednesday, Mr. Ghosn was quick to tell reporters that he was not planning to talk about the escape.
"I am here to talk about why I left," he said.
Ben Dooley and Vivian Yee reported from Beirut, and David Yaffe-Bellany from New York. Kevin Granville and Geneva Abdul contributed reporting from London, and Carlos Tejada from Hong Kong.

Texto completo: "Ghosts Guns," assembled from kits, can be bought online and don't have serial numbers. To learn more about them, we ordered one.
Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
It has always been legal in America for people to make their own guns.
Americans have been building personal firearms for hundreds of years, but more modern ways to make a gun have been developed. 3-D printed guns first became a reality in 2013. But it was not until last year, when the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives reported that 30 percent of the firearms seized in California were homemade, when I thought about "ghost gun" kits.
They are available online and will ship to your address. Some companies accept Bitcoin as payment. And the finished product doesn't have a serial number.
It's one way someone could anonymously acquire a working firearm.
On the Graphics desk at The New York Times, we're often thinking about visually compelling ways to tell stories. We wondered how easy it was to order and assemble a gun kit. So we considered buying one for a Glock 19.
At a certain point in the assembly, we would be in possession of a handgun without a license in Manhattan, which is illegal. So we needed to find someplace else to build and test our gun. We also wanted to experience the legal framework that buyers of gun kits face.
I started exploring states with more lenient gun laws. Florida, Nevada, Pennsylvania and New Hampshire were possibilities for various reasons. Florida has a large gun manufacturing sector, for example. And Pennsylvania has seen an increase in seizures of ghost guns. But as a nonresident, I would have potentially faced some restrictions in those states. We settled on Virginia, where the lack of restrictions and proximity to Washington and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, which we wanted to interview, provided a sweet spot for the project. I had the kit shipped to a colleague who lives in that state and works out of The Times's Washington bureau.
We decided that a video would be the best way to tell this story, which created an unanticipated problem: People seemed to be spooked that the The New York Times was filming a video about homemade guns. We struggled to find a shooting range that would let us test the weapon, and the A.T.F. denied our request for an on-camera interview.
Building the gun kit was a lot like finishing a minor home improvement project. I had to follow the instructions carefully and use the right tools. Removing too much polymer from the frame would have caused as many problems as not removing enough. When the right amount of polymer was removed, the kit became a firearm. It was tough to tell the exact moment when that happened, but it was clearly a functional weapon after I added all the internal parts.
I can see why responsible gun owners like these kits. They're fun to build. The process was a bit more difficult than I had anticipated, mostly because I had been living in New York for almost a decade and was a little rusty with tools. Looking back on the mistakes I made, I could make another gun much faster next time.
We interviewed a former employee of the National Rifle Association who is a firearms expert; a retired A.T.F. agent; and Representative Jennifer Wexton, a Democrat from Virginia's 10th Congressional district. Their arguments for more, or less, gun control seemed to echo conversations I had heard across the country.
We were worried about striking a balance on such a polarizing topic. After our video was published, Second Amendment advocates said we were fearmongers, while those seeking tighter restrictions said we were promoting gun kits.
One of the most surprising parts of the whole project came when we dropped off the firearm at the police station in Sterling, Va. Once an officer removed the weapon from our vehicle, I followed him to a locked area within the station where I was frisked and interviewed. Officers asked me questions while they dismantled the gun and looked for identifying features. They filed a report and performed a background check on me. Getting rid of the gun required a lot more screening than owning it.

Texto completo: It's Gabrielle Canon, here again, filling in for Arlene Martinez who will be back tomorrow.
Make sure you sign up for our In California newsletter, delivered every evening Monday through Friday.
Wednesday's news includes environmental concerns over the USMCA trade deal, a bounty for information on who is shooting wolves in Northern California, and a new fate for 30,000 trash cans nearly doomed to the landfill.
But first, today we learned there's a secret abandoned basketball court at the top of Disneyland's famous Matterhorn Bobsleds ride. Back in the day (aka the '70s and '80s) the park hired guys and gals to climb around outside of Disney's favorite mountain; the small court was a spot where they could chill between shifts or when the weather was bad. The climbers still make appearances from time to time, but according to WDW News Today (a Disneyland and Disneyworld specific online news org — yep, that's a thing), now the court is used by costumed cast members before their nightly "flight to the castle" fireworks celebration.
While you probably won't be able to catch a glimpse of the basketball court (or your favorite characters engaging in a pre-fireworks game of one-on-one), if you are a lucky SoCal resident, The Desert Sun reports you can at least get into the Happiest Place on Earth with a big discount. Three-day tickets are going for $199 — under $67 a day — and you can use them anytime between now and May 21.
For more fun facts about what is arguably one of the best rides in the West, read this story from the WDW.
Now, onto today's news.
Environmentalists are condemning the USMCA
The giant trade pact between the United States, Mexico, and Canada — ultimately a renegotiated NAFTA — is expected to come up for a vote in the Senate soon (unless there are any impeachment-related setbacks). But environmental advocacy organizations who have condemned the deal's failure to consider climate change are raising alarm about moving forward without binding standards on Mexico to regulate pollution.
“The deal does not even mention climate change, fails to adequately address toxic pollution, includes weak environmental standards and an even weaker enforcement mechanism,” the organizations said in a letter sent to Congress ahead of the House of Representatives' approval.
Lawmakers in the House who approved the Trump Administration's negotiated deal last month did authorize $300 million for clean-up efforts along the U. S. -Mexican border, where failing sewer systems pump toxic discharge into rivers threatening both ecosystems and lives. But critics of the deal are concerned that it doesn't do enough to curb the cause of the problem.
The Desert Sun published an investigation into the issue in 2018, that found local residents are dying of respiratory illnesses at higher rates due to the pollution and the numbers are rising. For more on the key changes between the new USMCA and NAFTA, here's an explainer from USA Today.
Newsom's new plans to combat homelessness
As the housing crisis continues to push Californians into poverty and onto the streets, Gov. Gavin Newsom announced today that he is seeking $750 million to help people pay their rent.
The fund, which will be created by executive order, comes two days ahead of his second annual budget proposal, which will be presented to the Legislature at the end of this week.
Newsom also called for 100 travel trailers and other temporary housing units that will be provided by the state to cities and counties for health and social services' use, and announced a new team that will help local governments.
Meanwhile, after vociferous opposition from locals, plans for a new homeless shelter in Oxnard were scrapped today. Across the state, cities have faced pushback from residents who don't want the shelters in their communities. The unhoused are also seeing an uptick in aggression and backlash.
"What we call the 'criminalization of homelessness' is a big problem," Maria Foscarinis, executive director of the National Law Center on Homelessness & Poverty told USA Today. "I think the problem is getting worse because the housing crisis is getting worse. "
What else we are reading today
A California venture capitalist was charged with obstructing a federal investigation into hundreds of thousands of dollars donated to President Trump's inaugural committee.
Moms 4 Housing, a collective of homeless women in Oakland, is gaining support from California lawmakers as they demand more affordable housing.
Close to half a million immigrants living in California take low-wage work — even when they have advanced degrees.
California lawmakers introduced new legislation today that would require telecommunication companies to fund at least 72 hours of backup power for cellphone towers in fire-prone areas.
Feds want info on gray wolf shooting
It's been over a year since a wolf — an endangered gray wolf to be exact — was shot in Modoc County, a rural area on the northern border of California. And now, officials with the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service are running low on leads. They are turning to the public for help with the investigation and offering a $2,500 cash reward for information.
The wolf, which crossed into California from Oregon in December 2018, was wearing a satellite tracker collar when he was shot. The 1½-year-old died from his wounds and was left along Country Road 91.
30,000 trash bins were on their way to the landfill — until a local company stepped up
A trash can graveyard stretches across a five-acre lot in Visalia, the result of the Central Valley city's decision to switch to a three-can system last year. But the city hasn't known what to do with the 30,000 plastic bins rendered useless by the switchover. It was contemplating grinding them up and sending them to the dump — at a cost of more than $300,000.
The Visalia Times Delta originally highlighted the issue in October, and noted the "cruel twist of irony: What had originally started as an innovative measure to promote recycling, was likely headed to clog the county landfill. " As a result, community members started coming forward with solutions. Now, a local company, AZS Dependable Inc. , has offered to charge the city only $51,085 to recycle the bins.
I'll leave you with a bit more good news, provided by Cronkite News.
In a planting project organized by Arizona's Game & Fish Department, volunteers stepped up to help the dwindling population of monarch butterflies, a species that migrates over 3,000 miles each year and relies on milkweed to lay their eggs.
The Western Monarch Butterfly Conservation Plan is a 50-year plan aiming to reverse the 74% decline in the beautiful flying insects across Arizona, California, Idaho, Nevada, Oregon, Utah and Washington — and it's working.
In 2018 there was a 97% decline in the numbers of butterflies reaching their wintering spots, compared to numbers just two decades ago. Last year, there was evidence that they could be bouncing back.
Thanks for tuning in the last few days! Arlene will be back in action tomorrow. 'Till next time!

Does skeptical reporting equate to a lack of patriotism? Some think so.

Texto completo: Pete Hegseth is dubious about the news media's loyalty and patriotism. Hegseth, a military veteran and weekend co-host of President Trump's favorite program, 'Fox and Friends,' put it this way the other day:
'I bemoan the fact, especially since the Iraq War, that it feels like patriotism is largely dead among our journalism corps. Where is the home team for a lot of these people? Taking a moment to cheer and appreciate that when America kills one of our enemies on the battlefield that's a good thing. It just doesn't feel like that exists much anymore.'
Commentators have often asked that question " whether journalists, committed to presenting more than just one side of a story, could be loyal members of the 'home team' amid a national crisis, especially a war. It came up in the days preceding the Persian Gulf War in 1991, when CNN correspondent Peter Arnett outraged some Americans by presenting the view from Baghdad; in the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks; in the run-up to the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003; and in lesser national security incidents since then, such as publication of classified National Security Agency documents in 2013.
Hegseth's comment was made in the aftermath of the U.S. military strike on Iranian Gen. Qasem Soleimani Friday, which prompted Iran to threaten retaliation and moved both nations closer to war.
The comment plays into a larger context, too. President Trump has repeatedly called into question reporters' loyalties. The news media, he has said, are 'the enemy of the people.'
Journalists have defended themselves for years by pointing out that there's a bold line between loyalty to the country and fealty to the people who are running it. Skepticism of those in power is patriotic, too, as the veteran editor and author Bill Kovach wrote in the wake of 9/11.
'A journalist is never more true to democracy " is never more engaged as a citizen, is never more patriotic " than when aggressively doing the job of independently verifying the news of the day; questioning the actions of those in authority; disclosing information the public needs but others wish secret for self-interested purposes,' he wrote.
This may be especially true during wartime. Officials in the Nixon administration deemed the New York Times and The Washington Post unpatriotic for publishing the Pentagon Papers, a secret government account of U.S. military involvement in Vietnam, though in hindsight the publication stands as a landmark of democratic action and journalistic truth-seeking.
The Pentagon and Trump administration spent three years seeking to bar The Post from publishing a similar trove of confidential documents and interviews with military and diplomatic officials about the war in Afghanistan. 'The Afghanistan Papers' revealed the government's doubts about the 18-year war, and exposed a campaign of official lies about its true progress.
Similar skepticism is warranted on the eve of another potential war, said Martin Baron, The Post's executive editor.
'Most of the press wasn't aggressive enough in questioning the premise for the Iraq War, when the Bush administration rationalized U.S. military action with false and misleading statements about that country's development and stockpiling of weapons of mass destruction,' he said.
'The highest responsibility of the press is to report thoroughly, vigorously and probingly when this country's leaders take actions that can put the lives of American troops and others at risk.'
But the probing often isn't equally skeptical or vigorous, said Tim Graham, director of media analysis for the Media Research Center, a conservative watchdog organization. He said American and Western journalists often are tougher on their own government officials than they are on those representing adversarial governments.
He argued that Western journalists frequently avoid asking tough follow-up questions or allow dubious claims to go unchallenged. He cited, for example, a CBS correspondent, Imtiaz Tyab, who reported in August that doctors at an Iranian hospital he visited said children there were dying of cancer as a result of American sanctions.
'If a journalist is more skeptical about what the American government is doing and just forwards what an Iranian spokesman tells them, people sense' unfairness, he said. 'You have to be at least as tough on [Iranian officials] as on the Americans.' (However, some authorities suggest that the CBS report was accurate.)
Graham doesn't go as far as Hegseth to suggest reporters are being unpatriotic, just that the same rules should apply equally.
But if skepticism equals disloyalty, Hegseth might have questioned his Fox colleagues Geraldo Rivera and Tucker Carlson, both of whom have raised doubts about the Trump administration's actions in the wake of Soleimani's death (Hegseth was unavailable for comment).
'Six months ago . . . this guy [Soleimani] was our friend,' Rivera said Friday on Fox. 'We may not have loved him, but he was our ally in the fight against ISIS. Everyone, do we remember ISIS? It's like ISIS never existed. ISIS had a caliphate. They were cutting people's heads off. Wait a second, they were burning Americans! We know who ISIS is. Who helped us defeat ISIS? This same guy! Soleimani. He saved people.'
Carlson put it more pointedly on his show Friday: 'Is Iran really the greatest threat we face?' he asked. 'And who's actually benefiting from this? And why are we continuing to ignore the decline of our own country in favor of jumping into another quagmire from which there is no obvious exit?'
Hegseth also might have questioned a fellow named Donald Trump, who has said he opposed the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003. 'I disagreed with that decision from the beginning,' he told reporters in September, repeating a debunked claim. 'I was outspoken about it. I thought it was a terrible mistake.'
Trump has made similar statements before. No one called him unpatriotic.

Texto completo: Longtime Facebook executive Andrew Bosworth said in a blunt internal post that the company's advertising tools were crucial to the election of Donald Trump in 2016 and may help him win again, but that executives must resist the temptation to make policy changes that would alter the course of legitimate political debate.
The post, which appeared on the company's internal systems last week and surfaced in news reports Tuesday, reflected the combination of anguish, defensiveness and brash self-confidence that many of the company's employees have more privately expressed in the aftermath of Trump's unexpected victory.
Bosworth's post also shed light on the thinking at the company's highest levels as it heads into a new election year amid controversies over its reluctance to police lies by politicians or limit their ability to narrowly target small groups of voters. Critics have said that addressing both issues is key to helping stanch the flood of disinformation on the platform.
'So was Facebook responsible for Donald Trump getting elected? I think the answer is yes, but not for the reasons anyone thinks,' wrote Bosworth, the company's vice president for augmented and virtual reality and long considered close to chief executive Mark Zuckerberg.
Bosworth dismissed the idea that Russian efforts to manipulate U.S. voters over Facebook, a subject of extensive government investigation and journalistic scrutiny, were crucial to Trump's victory. Bosworth, who shared his post publicly after the New York Times published it, also played down the importance of the use of Facebook data by the political consultancy Cambridge Analytica, which worked for the Trump campaign and boasted of its ability to target ads using psychological profiles of voters derived from their social media posts.
Rather, said Bosworth, who ran advertising at Facebook for several years, President Trump 'got elected because he ran the single best digital ad campaign I've ever seen from any advertiser. Period.'
Bosworth, a self-proclaimed liberal who donated heavily to 2016 Democratic Party nominee Hillary Clinton, particularly praised Trump's leading digital-advertising adviser in 2016, Brad Parscale, who is managing Trump's reelection campaign. Parscale has publicly cited Facebook's ability to reach small numbers of voters with targeted messages, using tens of thousands of versions of ads per day to maximize the campaign's effectiveness, as essential to Trump's victory.
'Parscale and Trump just did unbelievable work,' Bosworth wrote in his post. 'They weren't running misinformation or hoaxes. They weren't microtargeting or saying different things to different people. They just used the tools we had to show the right creative to each person. The use of custom audiences, video, ecommerce, and fresh creative remains the high water mark of digital ad campaigns in my opinion.'
That comment and some others puzzled some who read the post. The term 'microtargeting' is often understood to include the company's powerful Custom Audiences tool, which Trump used and allows advertisers to identify targets by a wide range of factors " location, age, income, interests, education or even visits to a certain website or Facebook page.
Bosworth's post generated significant commentary and debate in the comments section below it and on Twitter. Facebook employees also had more private conversations in which they questioned some of his assertions.
Sriram Krishnan, a former Facebook executive who worked on some of the Facebook ad platforms in question before leaving the company in 2016, wrote on Twitter that Bosworth's post showed off the good aspects of Facebook's company culture and its 'ability to be self-critical and introspective and debate things internally.'
Krishnan concurred with the memo's claim that Cambridge Analytica did not benefit Trump, calling the unauthorized use of data 'a total non-event for the 2016 election.' However, in his Twitter posts, Krishnan also noted that Bosworth identified a common reaction inside tech companies, where media criticisms are rejected 'because of one incorrect detail' while ignoring the broader point.
Alex Stamos, Facebook's former chief security officer, also weighed in on Twitter. Bosworth's analysis of Facebook's role in the 2016 election was correct, Stamos wrote, adding: 'Where I disagree with Boz is that I think limits on targeting for political and issue ads are neutral and fair in the long-run and conducive to healthier democracy. Same with a tightly drawn standard on false claims about opponents. Neither are an attack on Trump.'
Bosworth's post is reflective in sections. He urges the company not to overreact to criticism from the news media " even when employees think all or part of news reports are wrong. And he cites American moral philosopher John Rawls, who died in 2002, who proposed a form of moral decision-making called 'the veil of ignorance,' in which people are supposed to propose structures for a society without supposedly knowing factors including their own race, income, education level or gender.
Citing J.R.R. Tolkien's 'Lord of the Rings' epic, Bosworth also expressed serious concern about the possible corrupting influence of Facebook's power, comparing it to the ring carried by the hobbit Frodo Baggins.
Bosworth says the current election season carries a similar moral risk with regard to how Facebook sets advertising policies that could affect Trump and other politicians, who have vociferously opposed possible new restrictions.
'That brings me to the present moment, where we have maintained the same ad policies,' Bosworth wrote. 'It occurs to me that it very well may lead to the same result. As a committed liberal I find myself desperately wanting to pull any lever at my disposal to avoid the same result. So what stays my hand?'
'I find myself thinking of the Lord of the Rings at this moment. Specifically when Frodo offers the ring to Galadrial and she imagines using the power righteously, at first, but knows it will eventually corrupt her. As tempting as it is to use the tools available to us to change the outcome, I am confident we must never do that or we will become that which we fear.'
One Facebook employee, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said in an interview that debate inside Facebook was limited to reasonable changes. 'We could pull a lever, as in disallow political ads, disallow certain kinds of targeting, enforce stricter standards on racism in ads,' the employee said. 'No one at any point has ever suggested we deliberately scuttle Trump's campaign. That's pretty inconceivable.'

Texto completo: There she was: Judith Miller, the former New York Times reporter most closely identified with the paper's flawed reporting in the run-up to the Iraq War, chattering away on Fox News.
Karl Rove, one of the masterminds of that 2003 'shock and awe' invasion and its aftermath " now widely seen as disastrous " was called upon. And why, there was Ari Fleischer, the hawkish spokesman for President George W. Bush " and even the war's 'godfather,' Paul Wolfowitz.
All had recent star turns on Fox News. But that pro-Trump network was far from alone.
Days after President Trump ordered a drone strike that killed an Iranian commander, Maj. Gen. Qasem Soleimani " thrusting the nation on a potential path to war " the major Sunday news shows were showing their traditional colors, too.
In addition to giving Secretary of State Mike Pompeo his say, the shows also managed to find time for three politicians who had voted in favor of authorizing the 2003 invasion: Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) and former senator Rick Santorum, the Pennsylvania Republican.
But here's who they didn't talk to: a single one of the 156 members of Congress who voted no to the Iraq War.
Granted, some " sad to say " are permanently unavailable for comment. Elijah E. Cummings, Louise M. Slaughter, Ted Kennedy and Julia Carson, for example, have died.
But other Iraq War naysayers " including senators Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), Patty Murray (D-Wash.) and Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.) " are still in office, and therefore presumably not averse to sharing their views.
One hears the rumor that Bernie Sanders, the senator from Vermont, presidential hopeful and Iraq War opponent, is willing to hold forth on occasion.
Others of the original 156 have left office but remain in the public sphere.
Judd Legum, an independent journalist who has been keeping track of the punditry parade in his newsletter, Popular Information, thought the Sunday shows missed an important opportunity.
'If I were a producer, I would say, 'Hey, let's get some of those who were speaking out against the rush to war.' '
But, as Legum told me Tuesday, in something of an understatement, 'that doesn't seem to be the orientation of the coverage.'
This raises deeper questions.
The media often touts the need for self-examination " and issues the occasional mea culpa " but how much have journalists really learned over the past 17 years?
How much true change has there been since the Times, The Washington Post and many other news organizations put their weight behind the Iraq War " either indirectly through anonymously sourced reporting about weapons of mass destruction that turned out to be misleading, or directly through their editorial stances?
Based on what I've seen of the early coverage, not nearly enough.
Yes, it's true " and heartening " that some of the most prominent journalists in the country are expressing the need for skeptical journalism.
'The march to war is a hell of a drug,' CNN chief Washington correspondent Jake Tapper told Vanity Fair's Joe Pompeo. That piece also quoted Times executive editor Dean Baquet on the importance of reporting that questions official pronouncements, and it noted recent skeptical pieces of reporting in The Post.
But, just as in the wake of 9/11, there's a powerful pushback when skepticism rears its unpopular head.
'The president's Praetorian Guard is already out there questioning the patriotism of those who are skeptical, or anyone who dares to even welcome an opposing position,' Tapper said.
And the TV news media " largely " is up to its old tricks of amplifying the voices of military officials and those with a history of supporting war. (Astonishingly, a Fairness - Accuracy in Reporting study of coverage from early 2003 found that of the 267 on-camera American guests in a two-week period on three networks, only one " Ted Kennedy " expressed skepticism or opposition to the war.)
Sure, it's somewhat better now when it comes to a diversity of voices and views:
l Some pro-Iraq War talkers have changed their minds and were willing to say why and express newfound doubts.
l Fox's Tucker Carlson has been a strong contrarian voice.
l Presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) " critical of Trump's move " was featured on 'Meet the Press' Sunday (but, notably, she was a professor in 2002, not a voting senator).
What's more, the rise of digital news sources over the past 17 years means that mainstream TV pundits aren't as influential as they used to be.
It makes you wonder, though " what's really behind these coverage choices? Is it fear of being criticized as unpatriotic? A lack of vision about a different approach?
Is it, as Legum puts it, an underlying 'elite consensus' about our nation's role in the world, which amounts to 'credulousness about America's ability to improve things through military intervention'?
Or, as the Intercept's Glenn Greenwald accusingly tweeted, is war, for U.S. journalists, 'what gets their blood pumping'?
Whatever the reasons, with the stakes so high, too much of what we're seeing is far from encouraging.
And it's not nearly good enough.

Texto completo: Former deputy attorney general defends Comey firing memo, other actions
Rod J. Rosenstein, the former No. 2 Justice Department official whose tumultuous two-year tenure was defined by the special counsel investigation he initiated, is joining the King - Spalding law firm's special government investigations team, the firm announced Wednesday.
A longtime U.S. attorney tapped by President Trump to be the deputy attorney general, Rosenstein dealt with high-profile controversy within weeks of assuming his post, continuing almost to the moment when he left government in May.
Before he was in the job a month, Rosenstein, at Trump's request, wrote a memo to support the firing of FBI Director James B. Comey " a move that plunged the bureau and the Justice Department into chaos, as many feared the president was trying to thwart an investigation into possible coordination between his 2016 campaign and Russia.
Rosenstein then appointed Robert S. Mueller III as special counsel to lead that investigation and restore public faith in the process. But in doing so, he drew the ire of the commander in chief, who toyed intermittently with firing Rosenstein along with Attorney General Jeff Sessions, whose recusal from the Russia case left Rosenstein to supervise the matter.
In an interview, Rosenstein declined to address most of the politically thorny moments during his tenure as deputy attorney general " including his reported assurances to Trump about the Mueller investigation, the allegation that he suggested wearing a wire to surreptitiously record the president and his reaction to the inspector general's review of the Russia case.
He conceded that, 'certainly in retrospect, there are things that I might do differently,' but also asserted, 'I think we got all the big issues right.'
Rosenstein notably stood by giving Trump a memo used to fire Comey.
'No,' Rosenstein said, when asked if he regretted the move. 'I would have written that memo if any president asked me about my opinion about Jim Comey, and as you know, my view was 100 percent vindicated by the lengthy and detailed inspector general investigation. And my dispute with Mr. Comey was not personal. He violated some very important principles, and that's consistent with what the inspector general found.'
The inspector general rebuked Comey for his handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation; in supporting Comey's firing, Rosenstein expressed similar concerns.
Lawyers for Comey did not immediately return messages seeking comment.
Rosenstein said that while his handling of the Russia case might have attracted media attention, 'when I look back at my tenure at the department, it was mostly not about Russia.' He said he considered among his most significant accomplishments the rewriting of the Justice Department policy manual, the development of a new corporate fraud enforcement policy and the efforts the department made to curb opioid overdose deaths and violent crime.
He said he maintained a good relationship with officials in the Trump administration, and while he conceded his relationship with the president had 'ups and downs,' he asserted, 'I think I left on relatively good terms.'
Rosenstein said he chose King - Spalding because of the firm's international profile and 'collegial culture.' He said he had been impressed with lawyers from the firm with whom he worked over the years.
King - Spalding has added several former high-profile officials in recent months and years, including former deputy attorney general Sally Yates, former director of national intelligence Daniel Coats, former U.S. attorneys Zachary Fardon and John Horn, and former FBI chief of staff Zack Harmon.
Wick Sollers, chair of the firm's special matters and government investigations practice, said: 'Rod deserves his well-earned reputation for being decisive and unflappable in extraordinary professional situations. His experiences conducting and supervising large criminal and civil litigation uniquely qualify him to counsel and defend clients facing complex investigations, lawsuits and enforcement matters.'
Rosenstein had served in the Justice Department in both Democratic and Republican administrations before being nominated as deputy attorney general by Trump, and he generally enjoyed a reputation as a nonpartisan prosecutor. He served as the U.S. attorney in Maryland from 2005 to 2017, during the administrations of President George W. Bush and President Barack Obama.
Had he not been selected by Trump for the Justice Department leadership post, Rosenstein might have been little known outside of the Maryland and D.C. legal communities. But his role in the firing of Comey and his appointment and supervision of Mueller soon made him a household name " and presented him with unprecedented challenges.
Rosenstein was particularly on edge during the time when Comey was fired, people familiar with the events of that time say. Though Rosenstein wanted Comey gone over concerns about his handling of the Clinton email case, the president had other reasons " including that Comey would not say publicly the president wasn't personally being investigated in the Russia case.
When Mueller's team questioned the deputy attorney general about that period, he had to pause, 'appearing to have been overcome by emotion,' according to a government account of the interview.
Rosenstein was particularly upset with how the firing was initially blamed largely on him. Trump, though, ultimately conceded in a televised interview he had resolved to remove his FBI director no matter what other officials recommended, and was thinking about the Russia case when he did so.
Former acting FBI director Andrew McCabe alleged that Rosenstein suggested at one point after Comey was fired that he could wear a wire to surreptitiously monitor the president " a dramatic move that was never carried out. Rosenstein's defenders have said the suggestion was not considered seriously.
When discussions about the matter were reported in the fall of 2018 by the New York Times " and Rosenstein's job again seemed in jeopardy " Rosenstein sought to defuse the volatile situation and assure Trump that he would be treated fairly in the investigation, according to people familiar with matter.
'I give the investigation credibility,' Rosenstein said, according to an administration official with knowledge of what was said during the call. 'I can land the plane.'

The War on Philanthropy; Private giving achieves what government can't—which is why authoritarians hate it.

Texto completo: America has just completed a banner year for private giving. The 10 largest donations in 2019 amounted to $6.2 billion, up 8% from 2018. These went to a wide array of causes, and came from men and women of the right (Jim Walton, Karen Huntsman) and the left (George Soros, Eric Schmidt). When the total of all U.S. philanthropy becomes available this summer, it will show that Americans voluntarily gave away around $430 billion in 2019.
Private giving builds institutions of civil society that provide valuable services, alleviating many pressing public problems. The New York Public Library has operated as a charity since its founding 125 years ago, and Central Park is run by a donor-funded conservancy that rescued it from decay in 1980. Quietly effective philanthropies get little visibility, though, and scant credit from journalists, academics and politicians.
Instead, progressive editorialists and political candidates openly call for deep cuts in the charitable deduction, an end to tax protections for churches and other charities, the taxing down of personal fortunes, and new regimes in which government becomes the sole ministrant of societal needs. Givers like the Kochs and Waltons are treated as punching bags for ideological reasons, but even liberals such as Bill Gates, Eli Broad and Robert Smith are pilloried for practicing philanthropy.
Mr. Gates is called everything from a rank amateur to a manipulating megalomaniac for making massive donations to public health, education and other causes. The Broad Museum in Los Angeles has been picketed and its patron savaged for his gifts to charter schools. Paying off $34 million of loans for Morehouse College students earned Mr. Smith opprobrium for having made money in private equity.
"A gift like [Mr. Smith's] can make people believe that billionaires are taking care of our problems, and distract us from the ways in which others in finance are working to cause problems," writes Anand Giridharadas in "Winners Take All," this year's trendiest critique of philanthropy. One of a half-dozen books now out with a similar tone, it was lavishly praised by the Washington Post, New York Times and NPR for arguing that charitable giving is an "elite charade" that does more harm than good, a way of disguising merciless taking by appearing to give back, a tool of injustice in a rigged system, a means of suppressing dissent.
Today's critics of private giving are most misleading in their suggestion that it is primarily a game played by "the billionaire boys' club." That's not even close to accurate. The lion's share of America's vast philanthropy comes from ordinary citizens, 100 million of whom make charitable gifts annually, with the average household donating around $3,000. In addition, 77 million citizens volunteer time and labor. This broad generosity powers some 1.5 million independent nonprofits across the country, operating in every imaginable part of the economy, pursuing a panoply of approaches to national improvement.
Rather than being an instrument of plutocracy, America's highly decentralized philanthropy is one of its most pluralistic and democratic elements. Philanthropy disperses authority, gives individuals direct opportunities to change their communities, and lets nonmainstream alternatives have their day in the sun.
Charitable problem-solving also has many practical advantages. What works to alleviate homelessness or loneliness in old age may be different in Nebraska than in New York. With government programs it is almost impossible, even illegal, to pursue different strategies in different places. In philanthropy that's easy—local variegation is one of the field's inherent strengths. Studies show that philanthropic efforts are more effective than government in the amount of social repair accomplished per dollar.
One reason many progressives are so hostile to private giving is that government and charity are often competitors. They function in many of the same areas and sometimes attack the same problems, albeit in different ways. Critics of philanthropy argue that it is disruptive, even illegitimate, for civil-society groups to compete with the state. Public-employee unions, agency officials and activists for big government scream when social authority and resources migrate from state bureaus and into independent organizations like charter schools, churches, medical charities and trainers of the poor.
Authoritarians have always hated independent civil society. Russian, Iranian and Chinese dictators clamped down on charities in recent years because they want the state to be the only forum for human influence. "Everything within the state, nothing outside the state, nothing against the state" was Mussolini's encapsulation. For people with a controlling impulse, private wielders of resources represent alternative sources of ideas and social legitimacy that must be suppressed in favor of unitary government prescriptions.
Even democratically elected leaders are often jealous of civil society and blind to its productivity. Vice President Joe Biden said a few years ago that "every single great idea that has marked the 21st century, the 20th century, and the 19th century has required government vision and government incentive." The late Sen. Ted Kennedy once said that "the ballot box is the place where all change begins in America."
Actually, government and ballot boxes had surprisingly little to do with many climactic shifts in American history. From the rise of universal schooling to the revulsion against slavery, from the creation of great universities to the national mastery of rocketry and space flight, private donors paved the way for many breakthroughs. Charitable action has been one of the country's most valuable sources of ingenuity and social progress. In fields from brain research to immunotherapy, from family revival to improving teacher quality, philanthropists continue to lead.
If we view social refinement as solely the work of government, we will eventually despair because the political process so often disappoints. When we recognize the contributions of community institutions, self-help groups, faith activity, local norms, neighborhood networks and grass-roots collaborations, our prospects appear much brighter.
In America, independent problem-solvers pounce on many issues before they even rise to national notice. Privately funded civil society attends to a vast range of problems and threats. This is a distinguishing strength of the U.S. It will be a tragedy if Americans allow our rich tradition of voluntary action to be smothered.

The recent U.S. drone strike that killed Maj. Gen. Qasem Soleimani, Iran's grand military strategist in the Middle East, made me search my archives for an old column. In 2017 I wrote a piece called, "Moral Outrage, Moral Opposition, and When Trump Contemplates War." I claimed the moral outrage expressed by anti-war protesters in the United States was never moral opposition to war itself.
During the LBJ/Nixon/Vietnam years the anti-war protesters lived during the time of the military draft. The protesters didn't feel morally obligated to participate in a civil war in another country. Their moral outrage was against the draft, which is not the same thing as moral opposition to U.S. military intervention. So, to prevent future unrest (especially incidents like Kent State) the U.S. government ended the draft and created an all-volunteer army.
At the turn of the century, the Bush/ Cheney administration invaded Afghanistan before they invaded Iraq. The Afghan invasion was based on the "Bush doctrine," an unprecedented doctrine that sanctioned the invasion of sovereign states for harboring terrorists. At the time no serious opposition to the invasion formed because Americans were still morally outraged over 9/11. Plus, the ruling Afghan government wasn't recognized by the majority of the world's nations. So, the unprecedented language of the "Bush doctrine" was overlooked because of the insignificance of its target.
I stated that was the time for a serious moral opposition to war but it never materialized.
Success in Afghanistan and the lack of serious opposition to the invasion encouraged the Bush/Cheney administration to invade Iraq, a separate issue, but the Bush/Cheney administration figured if they connected Iraq to 9/11 and Afghanistan, America's moral outrage would continue in their favor, but that didn't work. So, the anti-war protesters during the Bush/Cheney/ Iraq years were morally outraged at the falsehoods that led to the invasion of Iraq, which is not a moral opposition to war itself.
Then in 2008 the Obama/Biden ticket won the presidency after successfully campaigning to end Bush's war in Iraq. President Obama kept his promise and withdrew the troops from Iraq, but ISIS emerged, there were still troops in Afghanistan, and a Syrian civil war ensued. The situation got confusing. In 2013 the American Spectator wanted to know who America was at war with. The Spectator wrote, "If you ask President Obama who the U.S. is at war with, he will usually say 'Al Qaeda,' the Taliban, and their associated forces. The Spectator asked: "Who are their associated forces?" Then stated the United States was in a cold war with Iran.
At the end of Obama's presidency, a White House correspondent for The New York Times stated that President Obama has an unexpected legacy of two full terms at war. He wrote: "Obama, the anti-war candidate, would have a longer tour of duty as a wartime president than FDR, LBJ, and Nixon."
And definitely no moral opposition.
There was another unexpected legacy of the Obama/Biden administration; drone warfare. In 2017,m Foreign Affairs Magazine stated, Trump inherited a targeted killing program that was the cornerstone of U.S. counterterrorism strategy for the past eight years. (Obama inherited it from his predecessor, also.) Three days into Obama's presidency, President Obama authorized his first military action: two drone strikes that killed as many as 20 civilians. Two terms and 540 drone attacks later (3,797 killed, 324 civilians), Obama left office after expanding and normalizing the use of armed drones for counterterrorism and close air support situations in non-battlefield settings. Washington Post columnist David Ignatius wrote with concern, "I think this is an issue we-both as a profession of journalist and the public-have accepted without sufficient debate. There is something about assassinations from ten thousand feet that is more acceptable than it would be from one foot, by the bayonet."
I concluded that column stating, Trump inherited these conflicts (plus the normalization of drone warfare) and when Trump escalates the conflicts all the moral outrage against war will be ignored or dismissed as partisan because serious opposition to war itself failed to develop when it was needed.

Bill Cosby Handed Bum Deal from Superior Court

Texto completo: Headnote COMMENTARY
On December 10, the Pennsylvania Superior Court unanimously rejected Bill Cosby's appeal.
The primary reason that Cosby and his team cited to justify the appeal is that Judge Steven T O'Neill allowed the testimony of prior bad acts - five women who were not connected to this case Cosby was tried for but who claimed that they were also drugged and assaulted by Cosby.
According to several attorneys and legal experts interviewed by NNPA Newswire, that ruling and many of the other decisions made by O'Neill over the course of the trial, were questionable.
"With respect to prior bad acts evidence, such as these other accusers, trial courts often let this type of evidence in where the Commonwealth can show that the allegations were similar or somewhat similar to the allegations in the current case, and the appellate courts usually approve of this," stated Zak Goldstein, a Philadelphia-based criminal appeals attorney with the firm, Goldstein Mehta LLC.
The NNPA Newswire covered both trials and their aftermath. Both trials hinged upon Cosby's interaction with Andrea Constand, a former Temple University athlete and employee.
Cosby acknowledged giving Constand one-and-a-half tablets of Benadryl, which is less than the normally dispensed dosage. Contrary to popular belief, Quaaludes were never administered to Constand.
Both Cosby and Constand agree that Constand was never coerced to accept the Benadryl tablets. She accepted them and consumed them of her own free will.
During Cosby's initial trial, in 2017, Constand and Kelly Johnson, who worked for Cosby's agent, the William Morris Agency, were allowed to testify. Both women alleged that Cosby drugged and sexually assaulted them.
Johnson initially testified said the incident happened in the late 1980s. However, during her testimony she changed the date of the incident at least three times, citing a different year each time.
While O'Neill allowed prosecutors to call Johnson, whose case was arguably unrelated to Constand, to testify, he refused to allow Cosby's lawyers to call Marguerite Jackson, a Temple University employee, who in a sworn affidavit, said Constand told her about Constand's scheme to "get Cosby."
Because of O'Neill's refusal to allow testimony from Jackson, the defense did not call a single witness during the 2017 trial, which ended in a hung jury.
In the second trial in 2018, O'Neill shockingly reversed his decision from allowing one woman to testify against Cosby, to letting prosecutors call five other women who had decades-old, uncharged, and un-proven claims against the actor.
One of the women, Janice Baker-Kinney, testified that she had taken a guaalude BEFORE visiting Cosby. Later, she said she accepted another pill from Cosby while at his home in Tahoe, Nevada.
When asked on the witness stand why she took a guaalude, Baker-Kinney gave perhaps the most damning response: "To get in the mood," she stated.
Another woman, Chelan La-sha, gave her testimony while being coached from the audience by her attorney. The Black
Press observed attorney Gloria Allred appearing to motion for her client to cry while on the witness stand. Lasha sobbed throughout the entire, almost unintelligible testimony.
O'Neill refused to allow Cosby's attorneys to question Lasha, or inform the jury, about her reported history of perjury and prostitution.
Another woman, former supermodel Janice Dickinson, testified that Cosby assaulted her in the 1980s. Dickinson claimed that she was on a modeling shoot on an exotic island with her boyfriend when Cosby called her from Nevada. She immediately left the boyfriend and flew to Nevada, where she had dinner with Cosby and a friend.
Dickinson said she went to Cosby's room, and he drugged and assaulted her.In her memoirs, however, Dickinson wrote an entirely different story.
She said, "Cosby was such a gentleman," and noted that she had gotten high on her own. A photo displayed in court regarding the night in question was curious.
It showed Cosby in a robe and talking on the telephone, while Dickinson lies on a bed appearing alert and a willing participant in whatever was to take place.
The second trial also was a lesson on how not to select a jury. When selected, Juror #11, quipped that Cosby was already guilty. However, O'Neill refused defense attorneys request to remove him. Also, despite other jurors admitting to "personal relationships" with case detectives and prosecutors, O'Neill also refused defense motions to remove them.
One juror even admitted to being neighbors and friends with O'Neill's court reporter, but the judge declined to remove that individual.
The judge also refused to rule on whether the statute of limitations had expired. In Pennsylvania, the statute of limitations on sexual assault is 12 years. For prosecutors to have brought a case against Cosby that dated back to 2004, it must have been done by December 31, 2016.
A day earlier, on December 30, 2016, prosecutors did charge Cosby. Lead defense attorney Tom Mesereau laid out travel and telephone records that should have proved that the case against Cosby was filed after the statute of limitations had run.
O'Neill declined to rule on the statute of limitations, and decided to allow jurors to determine if they had indeed expired. Based on statements released by the jury, they never considered the law about the statute of limitations.
Prosecutors pinpointed the date of the Constand/Cosby incident to the second or third week in January 2004. However, evidence showed that Cosby wasn't in Pennsylvania at all in January 2004. The documents also snowed Cosby wasn't in the state in December 2003.
Perhaps the most credible witness called by either side was Cosby's former personal chef, John-Conrad Ste. Marthe.
Earlier, Constand testified that the Ste. Marthe was at the house the night of the incident and left after preparing a meal, and he was still in Cosby's employ.
Ste. Marthe remembered Constand but testified that he left his position in May of 2003 - a 2009 New York Times feature on the chef noted that he did leave Cosby's employ in 2003.
Robert Russell, a former friend of Constand, said Constand was hooked on mushrooms and marijuana, and she came to America to try and become a millionaire.
Russell said he, Constand, and her mother, Gianna, were close friends in the late 1990s and early 2000s.
Russell, who said Con-stand's mother, Gianna, "hated blacks and gays," said Constand wasn't "this holistic person" she portrayed herself to be and that she had a plan to get $1 million from Cosby, who eventually paid Constand nearly $4 million to settle a civil claim she'd brought against him after prosecutors initially declined to prosecute Cosby.
That civil case involved Cosby providing a deposition that included his response to Con-stand's lawyers questioning whether he had provided Quaaludes to women he dated decades earlier.
In the deposition, Cosby maintained that he had never given women Quaaludes without their knowledge or consent. He said he obtained them because, in the 1970s, "it was the in thing." Both women and men wanted them, similar to the ecstasy craze of the 1980s and 1990s.
When asked if he gave them to women whom he wanted to have sex with, Cosby said he did.
While his statements to police and in his deposition remained consistent, Constand's statements changed several times. So much so, that former District Attorney, Bruce Castor, advised her to seek civil remedies because he said: "she's not credible."
O'Neill refused to allow Castor to testify on behalf of the defense, in part, because of a longstanding feud between the judge and Castor. Reportedly, O'Neill blamed Castor for outing an affair O'Neill had with a then-assistant district attorney in Castor's office.
During the Cosby trial, O'Neill refused to recuse himself, and inexplicably gave an emotional and arguably inappropriate dissertation from the bench on how much he loves his wife and how she's independent.
Shortly afterward, the jury reached its verdict to convict Cosby.

Congregant says Plame is not a member of Jewish temple

Texto completo: This updated version of this story includes comments from former Santa Fe City Councilor Steve Farber.
SANTA FE – A prominent member of Temple Beth Shalom says former CIA operative Valerie Plame, contrary to what she recently told an Israeli journalist, is not a member of the Jewish congregation in Santa Fe.
Plame, now a New Mexico congressional candidate, continues to draw criticism for retweeting an anti-Semitic article headlined “Jews are driving America’s wars” in 2017. But she said in the recent interview that she’s drawn to her own Jewish heritage and that she has joined Temple Beth Shalom.
One of her opponents in the race for the Democratic nomination for the U.S. House seat in New Mexico’s 3rd Congressional District has repeatedly called attention to the 2017 tweet, for which Plame has apologized. The campaign of District Attorney Marco Serna of Santa Fe says Plame “shared anti-Semitic conspiracy theories.”
As the Journal reported on Sunday, Plame said during the recent videotaped interview that she’d discovered that her great-grandfather was a rabbi in Ukraine, that she had “always been drawn to that aspect of my Jewish heritage” and that this interest led her to Temple Beth Shalom in Santa Fe.
She said she is a member of the temple. Israeli journalist Tal Schneider, who interviewed Plame, reported confirming with members of the local Jewish community that Plame had attended some services.
But Daniel Yohalem, a Santa Fe attorney who is a member of Temple Beth Shalom and has served on the temple board, said Wednesday that Plame has never been a member of the congregation, at least as of earlier this week.
He said he checked the temple’s membership list and also confirmed with the congregation’s staff that Plame is not a member.
“I am deeply concerned about Miss Plame’s repeated apparent lack of candor on these issues,” Yohalem said.
He said he has donated twice to the campaign of one of Plame’s Democratic opponents in the congressional race, attorney Teresa Leger Fernandez. Federal Election Commission records show one $250 contribution by Yohalem to the Leger campaign.
Alex Koren of the Plame campaign said Wednesday night, “Valerie has attended services at Temple Beth Shalom for years. It’s unfortunate that someone would try to question another person’s faith for political gain.”
Steve Farber, a former city councilor who is lawyer for Temple Beth Shalom, said Thursday that Plame has attended services there.
“I have sat next to Valerie during High Holiday services and have appreciated her sensitivity and concerns,” he said. Farber said he assumed that Plame had paid the required High Holiday rates both times he sat next to her, in 2018 and 2019.
Temple Beth Shalom Rabbi Neil Amswych, responding via email to Journal questions, said he couldn’t say whether Plame has joined the congregation “because our membership information is not public. I can say that Temple Beth Shalom is a welcoming, inclusive community that is open to all.”
When Plame is asked during Schneider’s interview if she is a member of the temple, Plame nods her head yes.
Plame had said in a popular James Bond-style campaign video from last year that she came from Ukrainian Jewish immigrants.
In 2017, after tweeting out the “Jews are driving America’s wars” article, which said Jews should be labeled as such when serving as TV commentators, Plame briefly defended the article, then apologized and said she had only skimmed it. She told Twitter followers, “I’m not perfect and make mistakes. This was a doozy. All I can do is admit them, try to be better, and read more thoroughly next time. Ugh.”
Plame, who has lived in Santa Fe for several years, became a national figure in 2003 when she was outed as a CIA operative, effectively ending her career with the spy agency, by people inside then-President George W. Bush’s administration. The outing was retaliation for a New York Times opinion piece written by her then-husband, former ambassador Joe Wilson, that challenged intelligence put forth by the Bush administration to justify the U.S. invasion of Iraq.

Questions remain during Iran crisis

Texto completo: Nearly five days after the world was jolted by America's death-by-drone assassination of Iran's leading general, Qassem Soleimani, on the road to Baghdad International Airport, here is one thing the average U.S. citizen can say with certainty:We don't know enough about it - not with the nation and the region seemingly on the brink of an unwanted war. Here's just a sample of many unanswered questions. Ask yourself: Is this any way for a democratic republic to do business?
1. Who was the U.S. contractor killed in Iraq? Of course, the start of the downward spiral of U.S.-Iranian relations can be traced back to 2017, or 1979, or 1953, depending on whom is asked. But the immediate events were triggered on Dec. 27, when a rocket attack on a base near the Iraqi city of Kirkuk killed an American civilian contractor and wounded several troops. The United States blamed Iranian-sponsored militias and struck back with a round of airstrikes that killed 25 people, which caused protesters tied to those militia groups to storm and partially overrun the American embassy in Baghdad, which caused President Donald Trump to order the Pentagon to follow through on a plan to kill Soleimani.
Oddly, considering the central role his death played in sparking what's become a huge international incident, the name of the U.S. contractor is still secret some 11 days later. Perhaps his mission was classified, or tied to the CIA. But the mystery is yet another reminder of how American citizens are mostly kept in the dark.
2. Was the assassination legal? Once upon a time in America, there was a bipartisan and arguably universal agreement that killing foreign leaders was something bad the U.S. had supported or actually did (in the Dominican Republic, Congo, and elsewhere) during the 1950s and '60s but should now ban forever. President Gerald Ford's landmark 1975 executive order was updated by Ronald Reagan in 1981 with the current Executive Order 12333, which states: "No person employed by or acting on behalf of the United States Government shall engage in, or conspire to engage in, assassination."
Pretty clear-cut, no? Well, as Bill Clinton, who changed the interpretation in 1998, might say, that all depends on what your definition of the word assassination is. The rise of al-Qaeda led to an exemption in the case of what the government defines as "terrorism." Experts also note that targeted killings can be considered legal under international law - but only if it prevents an imminent attack and is a proportional response.

3. Was an Iranian attack directed by Soleimani actually imminent? Given the fact that thwarting an imminent terrorist attack on Americans, our interests, or our allies is a) the only semi-valid legal justification for the U.S. drone strike and b) the one explanation that all Americans - even those least inclined to support our currently impeached president - would rally behind, you'd expect Team Trump would offer a compelling case for this.
No such thing has happened. On Tuesday morning, while I wrote this column, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo insisted during a news conference that "it was the right decision" but declined to offer specifics about any alleged plot that was foiled by killing the commander of Iran's elite Quds Force. Privately, Pentagon officials told the New York Times "the intelligence did not indicate an imminent attack," and the paper's well-sourced Middle East correspondent Rukmini Callimachi tweeted that any evidence was "razor thin."
4. Why was Pompeo advocating for aggressive action on Iran long before the events of the last couple of weeks? Last March, Trump's secretary of state traveled to Israel and gave an interview with the Christian Broadcasting Corp. in which he seemed to agree with the interviewer's premise that Trump may have been sent to Earth to protect Israel from Iran. "As a Christian, I certainly believe that's possible," Pompeo said, adding: "I am confident that the Lord is at work here."
That certainly dovetails with reports that Pompeo - aided at times by Pompeo's friend and West Point classmate, Pentagon chief Mark Esper - prodded the president for months toward a more aggressive posture on Iran, which would also please right-wing Israeli leaders with whom Pompeo has supposedly grown close, as well as his Christian fundamentalist constituency here at home.
Americans wouldn't have nearly so many questions if we had a government we could trust. Instead, we've been battered by a trail of dishonesty that began in Vietnam and grew wider with the blatant deceptions of the 2000s and 2010s over Iraq and Afghanistan. Rather than an honest government, the 2016 election produced a deceitful demagogue who has poured gasoline on that fire with literally thousands of lies.
Rather than believing the newest and worst fictions, Americans must rally behind Congress and the War Powers Act, the law that was inspired by Vietnam lies in 1973 and is needed to restrain an unfit and out-of-control president, more than ever. Or else the unanswered questions will keep piling up.

Texto completo: NEARLY FIVE days after the world was jolted by America's death-by-drone assassination of Iran's leading general, Qassem Soleimani, on the road to Baghdad International Airport, here is one thing the average U.S. citizen can say with certainty:We don't know enough about it - not with the nation and the region seemingly on the brink of an unwanted war. Here's just a sample of many unanswered questions. Ask yourself: Is this any way for a democratic republic to do business?
1. Who was the U.S. contractor killed in Iraq? Of course, the start of the downward spiral of U.S.-Iranian relations can be traced back to 2017, or 1979, or 1953, depending on who is asked. But the immediate events were triggered on Dec. 27, when a rocket attack on a base near the Iraqi city of Kirkuk killed an American civilian contractor and wounded several troops. The U.S. blamed Iranian-sponsored militias and struck back with a round of airstrikes that killed 25 people, which caused protesters tied to those militia groups to storm and partially overrun the American embassy in Baghdad, which caused President Trump to order the Pentagon to follow through on a plan to kill Soleimani.
Oddly, considering the central role his death played in sparking what's become a huge international incident, the name of the U.S. contractor is still secret some 11 days later. Perhaps his mission was classified, or tied to the CIA. But the mystery is yet another reminder of how American citizens are mostly kept in the dark.
2. Was the assassination legal? Once upon a time in America, there was a bipartisan and arguably universal agreement that killing foreign leaders was something bad the United States had supported or actually did (in the Dominican Republic, the Congo, and elsewhere) during the 1950s and '60s but should now ban forever. President Gerald Ford's landmark 1975 executive order was updated by Ronald Reagan in 1981 with the current Executive Order 12333, which states: "No person employed by or acting on behalf of the United States Government shall engage in, or conspire to engage in, assassination."
Pretty clear-cut, no? Well, as Bill Clinton, who changed the interpretation in 1998, might say, that all depends on what your definition of the word assassination is. The rise of al-Qaeda led to an exemption in the case of what the government defines as "terrorism." Experts also note that targeted killings can be considered legal under international law - but only if it prevents an imminent attack and is a proportional response. Which raises another unanswered question ....
3. Was an Iranian attack directed by Soleimani actually imminent? Given the fact that thwarting an imminent terrorist attack on Americans, our interests, or our allies is a) the only semi-valid legal justification for the U.S. drone strike and b) the one explanation that all Americans - even those least inclined to support our currently impeached president - would rally behind, you'd expect Team Trump would offer a compelling case for this.
No such thing has happened. On Tuesday morning, while I wrote this column, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo insisted during a news conference that "it was the right decision" but declined to offer specifics about any alleged plot that was foiled by killing the commander of Iran's elite Quds Force. Privately, Pentagon officials told the New York Times "the intelligence did not indicate an imminent attack," and the paper's well-sourced Middle East correspondent Rukmini Callimachi tweeted that any evidence was "razor thin."
4. Why was Pompeo advocating for aggressive action on Iran long before the events of the last couple of weeks? Last March, Trump's secretary of state traveled to Israel and gave an interview with the Christian Broadcasting Corp. in which he seemed to agree with the interviewer's premise that Trump may have been sent to Earth to protect Israel from Iran. "As a Christian, I certainly believe that's possible," Pompeo said, adding: "I am confident that the Lord is at work here."

Texto completo: Stacey Abrams, a Georgia Democrat who has launched a multi-million-dollar effort to combat voter suppression, will appear later this month at a Martin Luther King Jr. Day celebration in Portland.
The University of New England is hosting Abrams for a public forum at noon on Jan. 22 at Innovation Hall at the university's Portland campus on Stevens Avenue, the university announced Wednesday.
In 2018, Abrams mounted an unsuccessful bid for the Georgian governor's mansion, coming within 55,000 votes of her Republican opponent, Brian Kemp, according to The New York Times.
Since her loss, the Yale-educated tax lawyer delivered the Democrats' response President Donald Trump's 2019 State of the Union address and has launched an initiative, Fair Fight, to fight voter suppression, which she called a "national scourge" in a November interview with Politico.
"[A]ll of the progress we speak of as Democrats rests on the ability of voters to be heard and to participate in our process. You cannot have an effective health care system or laws that move our health care system forward, you cannot pass laws to address climate change if we do not have the right to vote," Abrams told Politico.
Abrams is a lifetime member of the Council on Foreign Relations, the 2012 recipient of the John F. Kennedy New Frontier Award and a member of the Center for American Progress' board of directors, according to the University of New England. She is the author of the 2018 New York Times best-seller "Lead from the Outside."
Abrams will be joined by Theodore R. Johnson, a senior fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice who has written on politics and racial disparities, the university said.
The university's annual MLK Day celebration is held in honor of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s May 1964 visit to St. Francis College, the University of New England's predecessor, and to encourage the discussion of racial equality.
The University of New England is Maine's largest private university.

Ship fires that reminded Lewes of seafaring heritage

Texto completo: Because Lewes is perched on the doorstep of the Atlantic, the seafaring tradition runs deep. From expert bay pilots to simple deck hands, from captains of oceangoing ships to skippers of humble menhaden fishing boats, mariners of all stripes have called Lewes home.
With the development of the railroad in the 19th century and the arrival of the automobile in the early 20th century, many Lewes residents turned from the sea, but two frightening fires and one Midwestern newspaper reminded the people of Lewes again of their proud seafaring heritage.
In the early decades of the 20th century, the Clyde Steamship Company operated several passenger ships between ports along the Atlantic coast, but Lewes was not one of them.
On Jan. 1, 1925, the Clyde liner Mohawk, commanded by Captain James Staples and carrying 200 passengers, left the dreary winter weather in New York City and set sail for sunny Jacksonville, Florida.
Steaming along the New Jersey coast, the ship encountered an icy storm that pounded the vessel with high, cold waves. During the night, members of the crew methodically knocked on stateroom doors and announced, "Get up, the ship's on fire!"
The fire had started in the afterhold and threatened to consume the entire ship. After Captain Staples radioed for assistance, two tugs, the Mars and the Kaleen, had steamed out of Lewes harbor to help.
The Coast Guard Cutter Kickapoo, stationed at Cape May, heard the distress call and sailed into the storm to help. The passenger liner Persian also diverted course to aid the stricken ship. As the Mohawk burned, the weather continued to deteriorate, and the fire continued to grow.
As the ship's crew circulated among the passengers to assure them that help was on its way, Mohawk steamed full speed ahead toward the Delaware Bay.
Despite the obvious danger, there was no panic among the passengers. Captain Staples turned the Mohawk into Delaware Bay, where several vessels had gathered to help those aboard the burning liner.
As the Mohawk shuttered to a halt and listed sharply to starboard, passengers, crew and Captain Staples were methodically transferred to rescue vessels. The Mohawk was a smoldering wreck, but not a life was lost.
Eleven months later in November, another passenger ship, the Lenape, carrying over 300 passengers, also caught fire along the New Jersey coast. In a remarkable repeat of the Mohawk disaster, the Lenape turned into Delaware Bay, where all but one of those aboard the ship were rescued.
One man who put his life-preserver on upside down and jumped off the ship was drowned.
During the two fiery disasters, over 500 people were saved by the Coast Guard, passing vessels and the seafaring community of Lewes.
The cool seamanship and professionalism of the rescuers received well-deserved national recognition, but a Midwestern newspaper, far from the ocean, perhaps said it best.
In an editorial titled, "A Thrill of Pride," the Indianapolis Times commented after the Mohawk fire, "(The rescuers) have shown what American seamen can do on American ships, even when the ships are sinking. They have stirred the hearts of millions of inland living Americans who had almost forgotten that we had coast lines and a merchant marine.
"They, and the Coast Guard men who aided them, have lived up to the best traditions of the sailors of all time, and in so doing they have proved that the claims of the United States to a place in the world as a seafaring nation are real."

Resting on your laurels is a risky business

Texto completo: It is easy to look at the massive amount of literature about the benefits of running (and other aerobic forms of exercise) and the data supporting it and conclude that running is a magic bullet for good health. And from my biased point of view, there is little doubt that running at almost any level below the marathon distance will provide a litany of ways a person's health can be better.
And yet we all know someone (maybe even ourselves) who suffers from the very same type of illnesses we believe running should protect us from, especially when it is coupled with a good diet. I still recall the surprise and anger when I discovered, despite a mostly good diet and all of the running I did, my blood pressure was high and needed to be treated with medication.
Later, I would need a stent to open an artery. Just recently, a very good friend who I have run with for at least 30 years suffered a heart attack – from out of nowhere. This story repeats far too often now.
And of course, there are the high-profile examples like Jim Fixx, a major force behind the running and fitness movements becoming "mainstream" and millions of people becoming participants in road racing, including the New York City Marathon.
Fixx's book, "The Complete Book of Running," became a New York Times best-seller and he had several successful follow-ups. In the introduction to The Complete Book of Running, Fixx wrote that his purpose was: "first, to introduce you to the extraordinary world of running, and second, to change your life."
Most runners know the next step in the story. Out for a run on the afternoon of July 20, 1984, Fixx suffered a massive heart attack and died, most likely along the route he was running. An autopsy revealed that Fixx died of a massive heart attack and that two of his coronary arteries were sufficiently blocked to warrant a bypass operation. Genetics did not favor Fixx as his father suffered from a heart attack at age 35 and died from one at age 43.
While Fixx's death quickly became an "I told you so" moment for many who did not like running anyway, others like Fred Lebow, the director of the New York City Marathon, took a different view. Lebow was quoted as saying "What I'm concerned about now is all those people who talk about the danger of running. What does this prove to them? Sure, we have people dying in Central Park, one or two a year while running. But I'm sure more people die on the golf course or watching the Yankees play baseball. Maybe if Jim Fixx didn't run, he'd have died five years ago."
Lebow need not have worried, however. In 1984 just over 14,470 people finished the New York City Marathon. This past year there were more than 53,157 official finishers according to the NYC Marathon website.
And that is exactly what should have happened as almost all of the data that keeps rolling in from studies continues to support the conclusion that the health benefits and quality of life improvements from running are substantial and well worth the effort. A tour through the conclusions of a number of studies produced the following claims:
Thirty minutes of running in the morning during weekdays for 3 consecutive weeks impacted positively on sleep and psychological functioning in healthy adolescents compared with control subjects.
In general, the more people run, the healthier their hearts tend to be.
Running just five minutes per day could add years to your life.
Getting 30 minutes or more of aerobic exercise on a regular basis makes people significantly less likely to die from almost any cause.
Research continues to show an hour or more of movement is even better. People who meet these exercise guidelines are significantly less likely to develop a number of forms of cancer, according to a major review of research.
There have been some concerns that extreme amounts of running could stress or scar the heart. There is a growing body of research that seems to indicate that's not a significant risk. Researchers have found that people who run at least 40 miles per week have healthier hearts than those who run 13 miles a week, for example. Consistency seems to be important as well.
Aerobic exercise has a cognitive-boosting effect for all ages, improving working memory, the ability to focus, and skills for task switching.
Several studies have shown that aerobic exercise can improve one's ability to cope with stress — and many of those studies focused on runners. In a review of research about exercise and stress published in Clinical Psychology Review, author Peter Salmon concluded that "this training recruits a process which confers enduring resilience to stress." Researchers think this may be because aerobic exercise increases levels of neurotransmitters like serotonin and norepinephrine, and causes the brain to generate new neurons. (Something runners with Parkinson's love to hear.)
On the other side of the spectrum, researchers continue testing and finding support for the theory that people who sit for long stretches have an increased chance of heart failure even if they exercised on a regular basis. Sitting for long periods of time remains an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease, cancer and diabetes.
So, don't give it up when you hear those scary stories. Instead, make sure you get up and exercise enough to put yourself in the best place possible.

Texto completo: After a U.S. drone strike killed Iranian General Qassem Soleimani last week, America braced itself for the unexpected: The Department of Homeland Security issued an advisory warning that Iran may launch cyberattacks against critical infrastructure. New York’s governor deployed the National Guard to New York City’s major airports.
Those precautions are wise and understandable. But Iran’s missile attacks on bases hosting U.S. troops in Iraq on Wednesday shows that the regime’s retaliation may be more conventional than expected.
Since the 1979 Islamic revolution, Iran has used terrorist groups as proxies to strike at civilians and embassies, attempting to obscure their own responsibility for these attacks. Now the Iranian regime is signaling a new approach. Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, told his advisers last week that its response should be a “direct and proportional attack on American interests,” according to the New York Times, and that it should be “openly carried out by Iranian forces themselves.”
That said, there is good reason to doubt that Iran’s response will be limited to this attack. Iran has fought its wars through proxies since the 1990s. This was Soleimani’s legacy. From 2003 until his death last week, he built up militias in Iraq, Yemen and Syria, waging an imperial war in the shadows on Iran’s behalf throughout the Middle East.
Some analysts acknowledge that Iran’s military has the capability to do a lot of damage, particularly to U.S. allies such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. But it “is not going to be able to out-escalate the United States,” says Alireza Nader, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. Khamenei understands this, he says, and he may be attempting to convey strength at a moment when the regime has been weakened.
Another possibility is that the U.S. drone strike demolished the strategy of plausible deniability that Iran has relied on for so long. It’s not just that Iran’s generals could no longer count on being spared the fate of the terrorists they cultivated and sponsored. The strike signaled a new U.S. strategy that imposes grave costs for Iran’s broader proxy war.
The regime will almost certainly still depend on its terrorist proxies. But Iran’s missile strike shows that it is prepared to engage in direct military attacks to take revenge for Soleimani. The world’s leading state sponsor of terrorism will also rely on conventional warfare.

Texto completo: Lancaster’s Max Bartos is heading to Broadway with the cast of “Sing Street.”
The musical, about a group of scrappy Dublin schoolboys in the 1980s who form a band, will move to the 900-seat Lyceum Theatre, with previews beginning March 26. It opens April 19, which will make it eligible for this year’s Tony nominations.
Currently “Sing Street” is playing at the New York Theatre Workshop , with plans to close January 26.
Highly anticipated 'Sing Street,' coming to New York with local actor Max Bartos
Bartos, who at 16 is the youngest member of the cast, plays Darren, their business manager, who eventually joins the band.
“I’m overwhelmed with gratitude for this opportunity,” says Bartos who also has a small role in the film “Uncut Gems,” currently in theaters. “The support that I’ve gotten from all my friends and family is incredible.”
“Sing Street” started out as a film, written and directed by John Carney, who also directed “Once,” which became a Tony Award winning musical. Irish playwright Enda Walsh, wrote the theatrical book for both.
The musical is being directed by Rebecca Taichman, who won a Tony for “Indecent,” and choreographed by Sonya Tayeh, who also oversees the dance in this season’s “Moulin Rouge!”
Max Bartos is 16, so of course, he started his own theater company, with first show, 'Edges,' Saturday
The “Sing Street” score is made up of nine songs written for the movie by Carney and Gary Clark (including one that was cut from the film), as well as fragments of ’80s pop songs.
The Off-Broadway production has sold well but reviews have been mixed.
Entertainment Weekly critic Christian Holub wrote that “It’s a joy just to be swept along that beautiful sea.”
For many critics, the problems seemed fixable. Ben Brantley of the New York Times called it “promising but still unfulfilled.”
Taichman said on Tuesday that the creative team was already at work revising the show.
“We’re looking at a lot of things — among them, how to nail the tone of the piece exactly right, and how to explode the world of New Romantics and synthesizers and 1980s pop music into the room more,” she told the New York Times. “We have listened to the wonderful audiences we’ve had, and have learned a tremendous amount, and we are now thrilled to have the opportunity to make the show better.”

An anti-Trump narrative dies in the Iraqi desert

Texto completo: Scrambling to condemn President Trump's decisive and popular elimination of the world's top terrorist, Qassem Soleimani, the New York Times filled most of a page on Jan. 6 with an editorial headlined, "Congress, stop the rush to war." Above this alarmist sentiment masquerading as sober constitutional propriety was a threatening but fanciful photo illustration of Trump and Republican leaders, a Reaper drone, a couple of Hellfire missiles, and the glowing fireball that was the Quds Force leader's doom.
The editorial was just days ago, but it came from a different epoch, when, if you squinted as hard as Trump's critics did, you could see a slide to full-scale war, the result of reckless impulsiveness rather than coherent strategy. But just two days after the editorial ran in print, the president was able to go on TV and tell the public that Iran was standing down after exacting only paltry and symbolic revenge.
Some rush to war.
Let's stipulate that Trump's threat to target Iran's cultural sites was wrongheaded and undermined the clear legal and moral case to be made for his hard line against Iran. It made it easy, as usual, to depict him and his administration as unthinking and devoid of any planning, plausible or otherwise. But easy answers are often lazy ones. And so it was with the Left's reflexive outrage over the hit on Soleimani.
Joe Biden, whose record of getting foreign policy wrong is unbroken for half a century, accused Trump of being "dangerously incompetent," of tossing a "stick of dynamite into a tinderbox," and of putting Iran in "the driver's seat" in the Middle East. He and others in the Democratic Party and presidential primary field, plus the usual bien-pensants, suggested there was a glaring contradiction between Trump's destruction of Soleimani and his promise to keep America out of unnecessary wars.
But as Yoram Hazony, author of The Virtue Of Nationalism, tweeted, "1. Pulling US forces out of Iraq, while 2. Holding Iran responsible for violent actions against America — That is a coherent policy. "
Tweet
The New York Times editorial also posed a question. Responding to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's suggestion of temporary turbulence in the Middle East — "it may be that there's a little noise here in the interim" — the prune-lipped gray lady asked, "Would Mr. Pompeo consider a vote by the Parliament in Baghdad noise?"
The answer is probably yes, and it should be. The Iraqi legislature took a nonbinding and symbolic vote to expel American forces from the country. But Prime Minister Adil Abdul-Mahdi also said U.S. troops would leave according to a timetable, which means nothing, and his letter to Parliament emphasized Iraq's neutrality between Washington and Tehran.
Trump's "rush to war" critics — that's most of the news media — made a meal out of the vote, suggesting it loosened America's grip on a dangerously unstable region of the world. But it was really no more than an effort to help Iran save face while it contemplated its regional humiliation.
The mad mullahs raged impotently like King Lear on the blasted heath: "I will have such revenges ... I will do such things —What they are, yet I know not, but they shall be the terrors of the earth!" These terrors turned out to be damp squibs — a few missiles lobbed with ineffective pyrotechnics into a wasteland. It was what Gen. Colin Powell once referred to as "bouncing rubble" or, better, an actual manifestation of pounding sand.
As our editorial points out, "World War III" trended (absurdly) on Twitter. It's a tribute to the power of vacuous alarmism on social media. Instead, we saw a shocked local bully trying to look unbowed after being given a bloody nose by a serious power. The bully can be expected to sneak out again and attack an innocent victim from behind. That's what he does. So the foreign policy success of the past week has not yet been fully accounted. But the mania and delusions of anti-Trumpian responses in the past week have outstripped perhaps anything we have seen in three years.
That's what you get when you lock your dial at 11 and respond to everything done by the president you hate with mockery, outrage, disdain, contempt, alarm, and disgust — indeed with anything other than a fair-minded assessment of the known facts. When you define yourself as a resistance rather than as a government in waiting, your responses are limited in type but not in degree.
The only variation is in vehemence.

New York Times compares John Bolton with Christine Blasey Ford

Texto completo: The New York Times drew a parallel between former national security adviser John Bolton and Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh's accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, after the former said he would testify in President Trump's Senate impeachment trial.
On Monday, Bolton indicated that he would be willing to testify in the trial if the Senate were to subpoena him. The move "echoes" Kavanaugh's contentious Senate confirmation, during which Ford testified about her allegations that he sexually assaulted her in high school, according to a Tuesday opinion article by the paper's chief Washington correspondent Carl Huse.
"With the former national security adviser John R. Bolton now volunteering to testify in the Senate impeachment trial of President Trump, the circumstances of the toxic 2018 Kavanaugh showdown could provide a template for what to expect as senators extend their clash over the ground rules for opening the proceeding," he wrote.
With Utah Sen. Mitt Romney, so far, the only Republican in the chamber who has expressed interest in having Bolton testify, Huse argued Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is unconcerned, "as [he was] in the Kavanaugh confirmation," with GOP members breaking from the party and voting to convict the president.
"Instead, Mr. McConnell’s concern in the Kavanaugh fight was the handful of Republicans who might break from the pack — Ms. Collins, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Jeff Flake of Arizona — and sink the nomination," Huse wrote. "As a result, Mr. McConnell needed to pay heed to their wishes as they pushed for reconvening the hearings to allow Ms. Blasey Ford to testify, and later to reopen the background check of Judge Kavanaugh to pursue new material that surfaced about his conduct."
The correspondent went on to point out a "major difference" between the two instances: "that Republicans have a larger majority to work with in the impeachment trial."
"During the Kavanaugh battle, Republicans held a 51-to-49 advantage and could afford to lose only one vote, making every vote essential," he said. "Republicans now control the Senate 53 to 47 and have more room to maneuver since Democrats would need to win four votes from Republicans to call witnesses."
Even if enough Republicans defect and join Democrats in pushing for a Bolton subpoena, Huse isn't sure that hearing from the former national security adviser will make a difference.
"Even if Mr. Bolton testified, it was unclear what he would say and whether it could significantly change the course of the trial," he said. "As the Kavanaugh example showed, new testimony — however explosive it may seem to some — does not necessarily change enough minds in the Senate to change an outcome."
The House of Representatives impeached Trump last month on two articles — abuse of power and obstruction of Congress — following the scandal surrounding his July 25 phone call with the president of Ukraine. During the call, the president asked the foreign leader to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, the 2020 Democratic front-runner. He was later accused of withholding military aid to the nation in exchange for the investigation.
Since Trump's impeachment, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has refused to pass the articles along to the Senate, where an impeachment trial is expected to begin this month, as she awaits "details" of McConnell's plan for the event. McConnell, however, so far does not have enough votes to proceed without the articles from Pelosi.
Huse, who was has been a Capitol Hill reporter for decades and wrote the 2019 book Confirmation Bias: Inside Washington's War Over the Supreme Court, from Scalia's Death to Justice Kavanaugh, was previously the Washington editor of the New York Times and the outlet's chief congressional correspondent.

'Ugly world': New York Times columnist suggests QAnon downloaded child porn via his computer connection

Texto completo: Economist and New York Times columnist Paul Krugman claimed his IP address was compromised and was used to download child pornography.
"Well, I’m on the phone with my computer security service, and as I understand it someone compromised my IP address and is using it to download child pornography," he tweeted Wednesday. "I might just be a random target. But this could be an attempt to Qanon me. It’s an ugly world out there." Krugman followed up his tweet a couple hours later stating, "The Times is now on the case."
Tweet
The Nobel Prize-winning economist did not provide further details about the attack or why he thought QAnon was responsible. Krugman has been a staunch critic of President Trump and accused the media of being too "pro-Trump."
QAnon is a complex conspiracy theory that spawned from the internet and alleges there is a "deep state" plot against the president. The believers of the conspiracy theory are largely a subsection of Trump supporters.
Last month, a Colorado mother was charged with the attempted kidnapping of her own daughter after she got involved with a member of a QAnon group. She claimed that "pedophiles" and "Satan worshipers" had taken her child.

Trump responds to Iran's act of war

Texto completo: In all the reportage and commentary on the killing of Qassem Soleimani, I haven’t seen much mention of an interesting parallel between the Iranian mullah regime’s attacks on America this past week and its attacks when it first came to power 40 years ago.
The similarity is that on both occasions, the Iranian regime violated diplomatic immunity.
In 1979, they seized 52 American diplomats and held them hostage for 444 days, releasing them only on the day Ronald Reagan took office. Last week, they attacked the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad after launching multiple attacks on U.S. troops in Iraq.
Diplomatic immunity is perhaps the oldest and most basic principle of international law. It has been sanctioned by international agreements and observed (even by Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin) for at least three centuries. Violation of diplomatic immunity is an act of war.
Iran’s attacks on diplomats reveal it as an outlaw regime.
That’s why it promulgated the fiction that “students” seized and controlled the hostages beyond the government’s control. In the past week, leading American media have echoed the mullah regime’s similar fictions, calling those who attacked the U.S. Embassy “mourners” (the New York Times) or “protesters” (the Washington Post). That’s in line with the Post headlines describing Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al Baghdadi as “an austere religious scholar” and calling Soleimani “Iran’s most revered military leader.”
American media giants’ ready endorsement of a tyrannical regime’s propaganda labels shouldn’t fool anyone. “The whole ‘protest’ against the United States Embassy compound in Baghdad last week was almost certainly a Soleimani-staged operation,” the New York Times’s Thomas Friedman wrote last week, not a spontaneous attack by “mourners” or “protesters,” just as the hostage-taking in 1979 was the work not of “students” but of the regime.
Much media commentary following Soleimani’s death dwelled on the possibility, clearly relished by some commentators, that Iran would retaliate violently against the United States. Few bothered to note that the embassy attack followed weeks of violent attacks: oil tankers seized, drones downed, bombs lobbed at a Saudi oil refinery, and rockets at U.S. troops.
Iran’s retaliation so far seems perfunctory. It’s possible Iran will attack the “great Satan” more aggressively later or that it will halt its attacks, as it did after Ronald Reagan ordered sorties that sank some of its ships in 1988.
In the meantime, the Obama administration’s hopes in the permanence of its JCPOA nuclear agreement with Iran, which never had majority support in Congress, were shattered by President Trump’s withdrawal in May 2018. And there’s little or no evidence that Iran ever became the cooperative partner in the Middle East that Barack Obama expected.
Distaste for Trump is obviously warping many critics’ judgment on Iran. Without losing a beat, Democrats such as Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut moved straight from criticizing Trump’s inaction to criticizing his action. News stories depicting his decision as impulsive and not based on serious military planning were, without acknowledgment, contradicted by news stories the next day.
But it’s possible for a knowledgeable observer not afflicted with Trump Derangement Syndrome to discern a coherent foreign policy strategy, “a bold agenda internationally and a deeply controversial one at home,” as Walter Russell Mead wrote this week in the Wall Street Journal. ”Confrontation with Iran, competition with China, outreach to Russia.”
Does “confrontation” mean, as the New Yorker’s military correspondent Dexter Filkins argues, regime change in Iran? Critics treat that as unthinkable, even though it would be welcomed by millions of Iranians. Those who care about human rights should not mourn the end of a thugocracy that throws gay men off high-rises and beats up women whose headscarves slip down.
It’s possible to encourage peaceful regime change. Reagan administration policies in the 1980s helped to undermine the communist regimes in Eastern Europe and unravel the Soviet Union — things almost no experts thought could happen.
Iran’s current regime has lasted for 40 years so far, about as long as the communist satellite regimes in Eastern Europe. Is it totally unrealistic to hope that it might peacefully disappear as well?
It is clear that the attempted Obama rapprochement with the Iranian regime has failed, and it seems possible that the elimination of its most aggressive promoter of terrorism, and Trump's crackdown on its economy, are an attempt to provoke peaceful regime change.
Meanwhile, Trump was justified under international law to respond with military force to a violation of diplomatic immunity (an act of war), just as Jimmy Carter was 40 years ago when he authorized the hostage rescue raid in Iran.
That attempt, unhappily, failed. The regime stayed in place. Trump’s action succeeded, and we’ll see what happens next.

Texto completo: We choose our presidents in happy times and sad, amid bull and bear markets, when we’re trying to conserve what is and when we’re itching to discover what might be.
We should always choose them as if we’re on the brink of war, because it’s impossible to predict when we’ll find ourselves there, in petrified need of a strong, stable leader we can trust.
Donald Trump was chosen in a fit of long-building and largely warranted cynicism, as a gamble and protest. He hadn’t demonstrated any particular strength, only that he could perform a peculiar burlesque of it. He showed zilch in the way of honor, but had a genius for stoking doubts that it still existed in politics at all. His supporters thrilled to a pledge of disruption, not a promise of safe harbor.
And here we are, with an inexperienced, impulsive and perpetually aggrieved commander in chief precisely when we can’t afford one.
I hope I have him wrong. I do. I hope that some of his worst colors are an act, that some of his rashest outbursts are a strategy, that instinct can be as useful as erudition and that in ordering the killing of Qassem Soleimani, he has persuaded Iran to rethink rather than redouble its aggression.
But there are reasons to be worried, even terrified, and they’re rooted in his untraditional and sometimes irrational approach to the presidency — and in the wages of that.
I’m scared because all presidents are only as good as the counsel they seek and the counselors who provide it, and Trump has burned through so many top advisers and so much good will that he operates with a hollowed-out staff of half-baked experience.
His second (and current) defense secretary, Mark Esper, lacks the seasoning and stature of his first, Jim Mattis, who resigned 13 months ago when Trump rejected his pleas and vowed to pull U.S. troops out of Syria. That, at least, was the specific prompt for Mattis’ departure. But Mattis also “found the president to be of limited cognitive ability and of generally dubious character,” wrote Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor-in-chief of The Atlantic, in a profile of Mattis last fall.
Limited cognition? Dubious character? Those may not matter when you’re choosing the gilt for a golf resort or skyscraper. They do when you’re deciding whether to put American lives on the line.
Trump is on his fourth national security adviser, Robert O’Brien, whose résumé is thin for the job. And throughout the Trump administration, there are relevant posts unfilled or occupied by officials never confirmed by the Senate.
We’re estranged from some of our most important allies, who are exhausted by Trump’s moods, offended by his mockery of them and chilled by his ignorance. They have concluded that if he is America, America is no longer trustworthy.
As Greg Miller of The Washington Post recently observed, the president “has disparaged U.S. intelligence agencies, disrupted relationships with European partners and diluted the power of the bully pulpit with thousands of falsehoods.”
All of that is coming home to roost. It’s impossible not to hear his justifications for Soleimani’s killing through the filter of his past exaggerations and lies. It will be equally difficult to have faith in the information that he doles out going forward.
And it’s hard to make sense of this. Erratic in so many other ways, Trump was fairly consistent in opposing American military entanglements in the Middle East, to the point of scornfully bashing Republicans who got us into Iraq and ignoring recommendations for reprisals against Iran before last week.
But in targeting Soleimani, he embraced a course that his predecessors in the Oval Office rejected as too extreme. According to The Times’ reporting, Pentagon officials were stunned.
Is Trump’s spectacular turnabout a function of fresh developments or a spasm of ego? We’re always yoked to a president’s psyche — to George W. Bush’s itch for separation from his father, to Barack Obama’s investment in his own unflappability. Trump’s self-soothing pantomimes of potency could strangle us.
And what of his recklessly provocative tweets? They’re one thing when he’s baiting Democrats, quite another when he’s thumbing his nose at international law. On Twitter he threatened to bomb important cultural sites in Iran and later explained to reporters aboard Air Force One that if it and other countries were going to engage in terrorism and torture, hell, why should we be any better?
Here, Mr. President, is the reason: Because we aspire to values that are actually worth fighting for. And the day we take our cues from the likes of the Taliban and the Islamic State is the day we should just junk the Statue of Liberty and retire the national anthem.
Reshaping America’s image in 280-character yowls and uppercase yelps, Trump told Iran to be prepared for military attacks of “a disproportionate manner.”
Please, God, let Richard Nixon’s “madman theory” of international relations — which held that an aura of recklessness might cow adversaries — have merit. Otherwise, there’s no telling where this mad man might drag us.
“Donald Trump has not made a single public statement since ordering last Thursday’s operation that has not been either unhelpful or counterproductive,” Noah Rothman, the associate editor of Commentary, wrote on Monday. Rothman is conservative, does not routinely bash Trump and defended Soleimani’s killing itself. But in his essay, titled “A Dangerous Man in Perilous Times,” he noted that “the best anyone can say about Trump’s spasmodic conduct is that it won’t matter.”
“Serious moments demand sober and rational minds at the helm, and the president’s behavior so far does not inspire confidence,” Rothman added.
No, it makes you tremble.

CDC warns of ‘widespread’ flu activity

Texto completo: The United States may be headed into a bad flu season, according to figures recently released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
As of the last week of December, “widespread” flu activity was reported by health departments in 46 states. More ominously, a second measure — the percentage of patients with flu symptoms visiting medical clinics — shot up almost to the peak reached at the height of the 2017-18 flu season, which was the most severe in a decade.
About 61,000 Americans died of flu that season, the CDC said. (The original estimate of 79,000 was revised downward last year; the agency said the number changed as more death certificate information became available.)
This year’s flu vaccine may not be particularly effective against the strain of the virus now widespread in the United States, experts said. But even so, it’s worth getting the shot: People who are vaccinated fare better if struck by the flu than those who are not.
It is still too early to know how severe this season will be, said Lynnette Brammer, leader of the agency’s domestic influenza surveillance team.
[ Read more: Utahn dies of the flu ]
Although many people are coming down with flu, the two chief indicators of severity — hospitalizations and deaths — are not yet elevated, she noted.
Deaths from pneumonia and flu are actually lower than normal at this time. But reports of hospitalization and death normally lag other indicators by at least two weeks.
The current season did begin unusually early. By late November, the flu had hit hard in the Deep South, from Texas to Georgia. The virus then broke out in California and the Rocky Mountain states, but was not widespread in the Northeast until recently.
That pattern echoes what happened in Australia, where winter runs from June through August. Flu came unusually early to the Southern Hemisphere in 2019. In seasons when Australia has a bad flu season, the Northern Hemisphere sometimes does, too.
In another important way, however, the United States is not following Australia’s lead. The A(H3N2) strain of influenza was dominant there last year, while most U.S. cases this season have been caused by a very different strain, called B Victoria. (B strains are named for the cities where they were first isolated.)
B strain flus do not normally arrive until late in the season. But when they do, “they often impact children more than adults and older adults,” Brammer said.
The CDC tracks the deaths of children individually, rather than making estimates, as is done for adults. Those older than 65 are usually the group hardest hit by flu. Thus far this season, 27 children have died of flu — in 2017-18, 187 died — but pediatric deaths don’t normally start peaking until mid-January.
On the rise now is the A(H1N1)pdm09 strain, which is a descendant of the pandemic “swine flu” that first appeared in 2009 and then morphed into a seasonal flu.
H1N1 strains are usually the first to appear. They usually cause fewer hospitalizations and deaths per capita than B strains or A(H3N2).
Thus far, based on limited testing data, this season’s flu shot does not look like a good match for the B Victoria flu and may not be very effective, the CDC said. But the shot does still appear to be well matched for the A(H1N1)pdm09 strain.
CDC flu data relies on reports from doctors’ offices, clinics and hospital emergency rooms about how many patients come in with flu symptoms.
An even faster measurement of flu’s spread comes from Kinsa Health, which collects daily readings of fevers from up to 2 million users around the country who own its thermometers. The devices connect to smartphones and instantly upload readings to the company’s app.
Kinsa readings indicate that flulike activity peaked Dec. 24 at a level just below the 2017-18 level — confirming what the CDC found — and has since dropped by almost a third, said Nita Nehru, a company spokeswoman.
But even this week’s lower figure “is much higher than is typical of this time of year,” she added. It may bounce up again soon, now that students have returned to school from holiday vacations.
The company assumes that fevers lasting three or more days indicate flu rather than a common cold, said Inder Singh, the company’s founder.
The CDC has not endorsed Kinsa’s methods, but the data does show flu patterns at least a week or two ahead of reports from medical clinics.
Thus far, almost none of the hundreds of samples tested by the CDC have been resistant to Tamiflu or any other common anti-flu drug. Those medications do not cure the flu; they only reduce the severity of an infection, and only if they are taken early.

Ross Douthat: Andrew Jackson in the Persian Gulf

Texto completo: There’s a witticism that makes the rounds on Twitter whenever Donald Trump does something particularly plutocratic or corrupt, a variation on the following: Look, this is what all those folks in Midwestern diners voted for. The sarcastic point being either that Trump’s populism was a con with blue-collar voters as its mark, or else that Trump’s supporters professed to care about his populist promises only as a means to own the libs.
But with the assassination of Qassem Soleimani, I’m afraid that I must deploy the one-liner seriously: This was, in fact, exactly what a certain kind of Trump supporter voted for — including both the downscale, disaffected conservatives who turned out for him in the primary and the blue-collar Obama-Trump moderates who tipped the Midwest in the general election.
Not the killing of Soleimani specifically; like Trump himself on the campaign trail, some of these voters wouldn’t be able to tell the Quds Force from the Kurds. But the strategic spirit behind the killing, the preference for a single act of vengeance over more ambitious forms of intervention, the belief in the hardest possible counterpunch, the dismissal of norms and rules and cautious habits that constrain the violence that America deals out … all this is what Trump promised in the 2016 campaign, with his simultaneous dismissal of both neoconservatism and liberal internationalism and his pledge to crush America’s enemies by any means.
This combined promise was not a contradiction; it was an expression of a practical philosophy of foreign policy, usefully called Jacksonianism, that many Americans and especially many white and rural and working-class Americans have always tended to embrace.
The phrase “Jacksonian” belongs to the foreign policy scholar Walter Russell Mead, part of a famous typology in which he divides U.S. foreign policy tendencies into four worldviews: Hamiltonian, Wilsonian, Jacksonian and Jeffersonian. The worldviews are simplifications (“intended to be suggestive and evocative,” in Mead’s words), and they inevitably frustrate many scholars; nonetheless, they remain a useful way of thinking about how, in our imperial era, U.S. foreign policy tends to work.
The Hamiltonians are the business-minded internationalists, cold-eyed and stability-oriented and wary of wars that seem idealistic rather than self-interested. The Wilsonians are the idealists, whether neoconservative or liberal-humanitarian, who regard the U.S. military as a force for spreading democracy and protecting human rights. Most foreign policy elites belong to one of these two groups, both political parties include both tendencies in their upper echelons, and most recent presidencies have been defined by internal conflicts between the two.
But far more American voters are either Jacksonians or Jeffersonians. The Jeffersonian impulse, more common on the left than on the right, is toward a “come home, America” retreat from empire that regards global hegemony as a corrupting folly and America’s wars as mostly unwise and unjust. (“No blood for oil” is the defining Jeffersonian attitude toward all our Middle Eastern misadventures.) The Jacksonian tendency, more common on the right than on the left, is toward a pugilistic nationalism that’s wary of all international entanglements but ready for war whenever threats arise. (“More rubble, less trouble” is the essential Jacksonian credo.) Since neither tendency has that much purchase in the imperial capital, it’s a safe bet that at any given moment in Washington, D.C., elites in both political parties will be trying to mobilize Jacksonian or Jeffersonian sentiment to achieve Hamiltonian or Wilsonian ends.
But when elites of both persuasions preside over too many calamities, you can get Jeffersonians and Jacksonians as important presidential contenders in their own right — think of George McGovern and George Wallace when the Vietnam War went bad. And when one party’s elite loses control of the electoral process entirely, it turns out that you can get an actual Jacksonian in the White House.
Yes, not everything Trump has done fits Mead’s paradigm — but a great deal of what makes him different from previous presidents is plainly Jacksonian. A Hamiltonian wouldn’t have saber-rattled so wildly against North Korea; a Wilsonian wouldn’t be so subsequently eager for a deal with such an odious regime. A Hamiltonian wouldn’t be as eager for an extended trade war with China; a Wilsonian would speak out more clearly against Beijing’s human rights abuses instead of just treating them as one more bargaining chip. Trump’s bureaucracy-impeded attempts to pull out of Syria and Afghanistan are patently Jacksonian; likewise his disdain for his predecessor’s negotiations on climate change. His eagerness to pardon war criminals and threaten war crimes, meanwhile, are Jacksonianism at its worst.
What is the best of Jacksonianism? I would say it’s the capacity to identify and prioritize threats, an area where Wilsonians get way too expansive and ambitious (“make the world safe for democracy,” “an end to evil”), while Hamiltonians sometimes let realpolitik blind them to ideological enmities that can’t be negotiated away.
To the extent that Trump’s foreign policy has been a useful corrective to his predecessors, and better than what other Republican candidates might have offered, it’s been because of his attempts at just such a prioritization. The execution has been, inevitably, Trumpy, but the goals — drawing down in Syria and Central Asia, confronting China while de-escalating with North Korea, burden-shifting to other NATO powers in Europe while keeping our relationship with Russia cool but short of Cold War hostility — are more strategically reasonable than the Bushian and Clintonite forms of interventionism that Trump campaigned against.
But in Trump’s Iran policy we may be seeing the limits of Jacksonianism, or at least a Jacksonianism that operates in strategic contexts that its own impulses did not create.
The Iranian government is indeed our enemy, to an extent that the Hamiltonians in the Obama administration sometimes underestimated, and in that sense Trump’s hawkishness toward the mullahs fits with his Jacksonian approach. But the Tehran regime’s capacity and inclination to cause problems for America also reflect our regional presence, posture and alliances, which mostly exist to advance a kind of mixtape of Hamiltonian and Wilsonian grand strategies — access to Middle Eastern oil, the promotion of democracy and human rights, and regime change in Tehran itself.
None of these are naturally Jacksonian goals, especially now that America is more energy independent than when the Carter Doctrine was formulated or the first Iraq War fought. Were America’s Iran policy fully Jacksonian we might still be at loggerheads with Tehran, but we wouldn’t be nearly so invested in projecting power in the Persian Gulf, and there would be fewer natural flash points and fewer targets for Iranian attacks.
But so long as Trump is working within an inherited Hamiltonian-Wilsonian strategic framework, his Jacksonian tactical approach — in the Soleimani case, picking the most surprising and dramatic option on the military board of retaliatory options — is unlikely to serve his official goal of escaping endless Middle Eastern entanglements. Instead, it points to either a permanent retaliatory cycle with the Iranians — we hit hard, they hit hard, we hit a little harder, ad infinitum — or else a disastrous ground war in a nonessential theater, the least Jacksonian of ends.
Precisely because I think Trump’s Jacksonianism is fundamentally sincere, I don’t think the full-scale war scenario is particularly likely. And since I’ve written numerous columns, before his election and since, about Trump as geopolitical destabilizer without anything as bad as Obama’s still-unfolding Libya folly yet ensuing, it’s important to stress that the fallout from the Suleimani gambit could less dramatic than the panicked punditry expects. Indeed, if the dead general was really the Islamic Republic’s Stonewall Jackson, its asymmetric strategy’s indispensable man, then over the long run his death might benefit U.S. interests more than any subsequent escalation hurts them.
But the most likely near-term consequence of Soleimani’s death is an escalation in hostilities that looks to most Americans like more of the endless war that Trump campaigned against. In which case some war-weary voters might decide that if they really want out of futile Middle Eastern conflicts electing a ruthless Jacksonian is not enough; only a peace-seeking Jeffersonian will do.
And it just so happens that a genuine left-wing Jeffersonian, Bernie Sanders, is currently near the top of the Democratic field, contending with Joe Biden, the embodiment of the Hamiltonian-Wilsonian elite dialectic despite his blue-collar lingo, in an increasingly spirited foreign policy debate.
If the establishment’s follies gave us Trump’s Jacksonian presidency, in other words, the question before the Democratic electorate is whether the perils of Trumpism require that we give that establishment another chance — or whether putting a Jeffersonian in charge of an empire built by Hamiltonians and Wilsonians is the only reasonable option left.

Texto completo: A Utahn has died from influenza — the state’s first confirmed death of the current flu season.
According to the Southwest Utah Public Health Department, an adult under the age of 65 died recently of influenza type A. The department did not provide any more details about the person, who lived in one of the five counties it serves: Beaver, Garfield, Iron, Kane and Washington.
According to SWUPHD epidemiologist Kassidy Peterson, 36 people — from “infants to the elderly” — have been hospitalized with the flu in those five counties this season. Statewide, more than 170 people have been hospitalized with influenza.
“It’s not too late to get vaccinated,” Peterson said, “and we urge everyone to do so — especially those whose age or health condition makes them more vulnerable.”
Influenza is contagious and can spread by droplets from infected people when they talk, cough or sneeze, according to the SWUPHD. Symptoms may include rapid onset of fever, chills, cough, sore throat, muscle or body aches, headache, fatigue and vomiting. Diarrhea is also a symptom, but is more common in children than adults.
Nationally, recently released figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show the nation may be headed into a bad flu season, The New York Times reported Wednesday.
As of the last week of December, health departments in 46 states reported “widespread” flu activity. And the percentage of patients with flu symptoms visiting medical clinics shot up, almost to the peak reached at the height of the 2017-18 flu season, which was the most severe in a decade, the Times reported.

Texto completo: There are no more adults in the room.
After three harrowing years, we’ve reached the point many of us feared from the moment Donald Trump was elected. His decision to kill Maj. Gen. Qassem Soleimani, Iran’s second most important official, made at Mar-a-Lago with little discernible deliberation, has brought the United States to the brink of a devastating new conflict in the Middle East.
We don’t yet know how Iran will retaliate, or whether all-out war will be averted. But already, NATO has suspended its mission training Iraqi forces to fight ISIS. Iraq’s Parliament has voted to expel U.S. troops — a longtime Iranian objective. (On Monday, U.S. forces sent a letter saying they were withdrawing from Iraq in response, only to then claim that it was a draft released in error.)
On Sunday, Iran said it will no longer be bound by the remaining restrictions on its nuclear program in the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, the deal that Trump abandoned in 2018. Trump has been threatening to commit war crimes by destroying Iran’s cultural sites and tried to use Twitter to notify Congress of his intention to respond to any Iranian reprisals with military escalation.
The administration has said that the killing of Soleimani was justified by an imminent threat to American lives, but there is no reason to believe this. One skeptical U.S. official told The New York Times that the new intelligence indicated nothing but “a normal Monday in the Middle East,” and Democrats briefed on it were unconvinced by the administration’s case.
The Washington Post reported that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo — who last year agreed with a Christian Broadcasting Network interviewer that God might have sent Trump to save Israel from the “Iranian menace” — has been pushing for a hit on Soleimani for months.
Rather than self-defense, the Soleimani killing seems like the dreadful result of several intersecting dynamics. There’s the influence of rapture-mad Iran hawks like Pompeo and Vice President Mike Pence. Defense officials who might have stood up to Trump have all left the administration. According to Peter Bergen’s book “Trump and His Generals,” James Mattis, Trump’s former secretary of defense, instructed his subordinates not to provide the president with options for a military showdown with Iran. But with Mattis gone, military officials, The Times reported, presented Trump with the possibility of killing Soleimani as the “most extreme” option on a menu of choices, and were “flabbergasted” when he picked it.
Trump likely had mixed motives. He was reportedly upset over TV images of militia supporters storming the U.S. Embassy in Iraq. According to The Post, he also was frustrated by “negative coverage” of his decision last year to order and then call off strikes on Iran.
Beyond that, Trump, now impeached and facing trial in the Senate, has laid out his rationale over years of tweets. The president is a master of projection, and his accusations against others are a decent guide to how he himself will behave. He told us, over and over again, that he believed Barack Obama would start a war with Iran to “save face” and because his “poll numbers are in a tailspin” and he needed to “get reelected.” To Trump, a wag-the-dog war with Iran evidently seemed like a natural move for a president in trouble.
It’s hard to see how this ends without disaster. Defenders of Trump’s move have suggested that he might have reestablished deterrence against Iran, frightening its leadership into restraint. But Vali Nasr, a Middle East scholar at Johns Hopkins University and former senior adviser to Obama’s State Department, tells me that Iran likely believes that it has to reestablish deterrence against the United States.
“If they don’t do anything, or if they don’t do enough, then Trump will get comfortable with this kind of behavior, and that worries them,” said Nasr.
To Iranians, after all, America is the aggressor, scrapping a nuclear agreement that they were abiding by and imposing a punishing “maximum pressure” sanctions campaign. Just like militarists in the United States, they’re likely to assume that weakness invites attacks.
“I don’t think they want to provoke war, but they do want to send a signal that they’re prepared for it,” said Nasr.
Even if Iran were to somehow decide not to strike back at the United States, it’s still ramping up its nuclear program, and Trump has obliterated the possibility of a return to negotiations.
“His maximum pressure policy has failed,” Nasr said of Trump. “He has only produced a more dangerous Iran.”
Meanwhile, ISIS benefits from the breach between Iraq and America.
“ISIS suicide and vehicle bombings have nearly stopped entirely,” said Brett McGurk, who until 2018 was special presidential envoy to the coalition fighting ISIS. “Only a few years ago, there were 50 per month, killing scores of Iraqis. That’s because of what we have done and continue to do. These networks will regenerate rapidly if we are forced to leave, and they will again turn their attention on the West.”
Unlike with North Korea, it’s difficult to imagine any photo op or exchange of love letters defusing the crisis the president has created. Most of this country has never accepted Trump, but over the past three years, many have gotten used to him, lulled into uneasy complacency by an establishment that has too often failed to treat him as a walking national emergency.
Now the nightmare phase of the Trump presidency is here. The biggest surprise is that it took so long.

IN TRUMP'S AMERICA, 'THE ECONOMY' IS ALL THAT COUNTS

Texto completo: Here's yet another public policy decision by the Trump administration that the good folks at Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce can probably get behind.
The federal government has stopped investigating most migratory bird deaths and, in fact, is discouraging local governments and businesses from taking precautions to protect birds.
All those regulations requiring investigations of large-scale kills places a burden on businesses, after all, and therefore isn't good for the health of the economy.
According to a recent investigative report in the New York Times, the state of Virginia was preparing for a major bridge and tunnel expansion in Chesapeake Bay in 2018, and engineers on the project were aware that the area that would be impacted was the nesting grounds of 25,000 gulls, black skimmers, royal terns and other seabirds.
So they planned to develop an artificial island to attract the birds away from their old habitat. But the Fish and Wildlife Service, under Donald Trump's tutelage, notified the state that it is no longer required to do that. The administration has "clarified" the Migratory Bird Act of 1918 to not only eliminate criminal penalties for bird kills that "come in the course of normal business," but no longer required to file reports of bird deaths. Consequently, the island has not been built while the bridge and tunnel project proceeds.
The "clarification" of the century-old law, of course, fits right in with Trump's assertion that the oil industry, in particular, has been subject to "totalitarian tactics" under the the law.
Oil and gas trade associations often cite former President Barack Obama's administration for prosecuting seven oil companies in North Dakota for the deaths of 28 birds.
"It felt like it was weaponized against one industry," Kathleen Sgamma, president of the West Energy Alliance, told the newspaper.
Any restrictions on fossil fuel companies, we've come to learn, amount to waving a red-flag at Trump.
Hence, now if a landowner destroys a barn knowing it is filled with baby owls, they would not be liable, as long as the intent was not to kill the owls. Nor would the spraying of a banned pesticide represent a legal liability as long as the birds were not the "intended target."
This all comes on the heels of rollbacks in dozens of environmental protections that previous administrations have enacted over the years, including major efforts to reduce fossil fuel emissions that are directly linked to global warming and climate change.
Only four months ago, ornithologists at Cornell and Georgetown reported the news that the wild bird population in the U.S. and Canada has diminished by a third in the past 50 years, much of it attributed to climate change.
Birds are indicator species, they said, and serve as acutely sensitive barometers of environmental health.
"Their mass declines signal that the earth's biological systems are in trouble," wrote Drs. John Fitzpatrick and Peter Marra.
They also reported all is not lost - that the staggering loss of birds can be reversed with scientific conservation management and programs that protect wetlands.
But that, of course, takes an awareness by governments at all levels and, most of all, encouragement from the federal government. Instead, we are getting the opposite. The environment, endangered species and the birds are sacrificed for the "good" of the economy. It comes before all.
Aren't you happy how we are making America great again?

FOR 2020, 'OK BOOMER' IS THE WRONG TOPIC

Texto completo: OK, I'll admit it.
As someone born at the height of the baby boom, my instinctive reaction to the currently fashionable ridicule being directed at my generation is a snarky defense.
Did our young critics face anything like the Vietnam draft, or struggle with staggering inflation or job markets choked with fellow boomers, or watch their political heroes being murdered one after another?
But where does that kind of reaction get us?
No, it is better to recognize and acknowledge the many ways it may well seem to younger people that we boomers have been selfish, self-righteous and have really screwed things up for them.
Probably paramount among our failures is not addressing the existential threat of climate change. Given the scientific evidence, that is inexcusable.
But also grievous is how we have fostered an economy and taxation system that exacerbates the wealth gap between young and old. And, unlike the generation before us, we have utterly failed to make long-term investments in infrastructure such as highways, high-speed rail and subways.
And we have blithely enjoyed a short-term sugar high by running up a massive national debt and leaving the consequences for younger people to face.
We have failed to protect children from firearms in schools, and have been slow to fully embrace gender equality and to attack longstanding cultures of sexual harassment in and out of the workplace.
We have countenanced both the ugly racial backlash against Barack Obama's presidency and a hysterical anti-immigrant movement. Both should have made us take to the proverbial streets.
We haven't done enough to invest in shaping economies of the future, and instead have thrown up our hands and blamed technology, deindustrialization and globalization. The kind of strategic, long-term action that is probably needed might be inconvenient and costly, so we kicked the can down the road.
Shared sacrifice? What's that?
And that list doesn't even include two of the most explosive issues of generational conflict - access to adequate and affordable health care and the skyrocketing costs of education and the resulting crisis of debt.
Looking at it from their perspective, and accounting for their different life experiences, one can see why they think we've screwed things up.
Against this mea culpa backdrop, I think about a recent Washington Post opus focused on how 2019 was not only the year of "OK boomer," but one in which "the generations were at each other's throats."
The story describes how age-based prejudice appears to be the last bastion of acceptable bias in proper society. Decent people feel free to sling nasty generalizations across generational lines that they would never dare utter about race, gender or sexual orientation.
Predictably, the coarse and filter-free world of social media has played a major role in all this. It's an "intergenerational quipping contest, fueled by the rapid, reductionist and unrestrictive nation of social media, which makes it far too easy to cast verbal stones," asserts the Post writer, quoting academics who study such things.
And many of the generalizations feel so unfair. The story says some older pundits were upset that 16-year-old Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg was named Time's Person of the Year instead of Nancy Pelosi, who is 79. Personally, I was elated at the Thunberg choice on its merits, but also because it so riled our thin-skinned president.
In researching this column, I read a trove of what I regarded as self-righteous and egocentric jabs from both sides of the generational divide. If I found the younger generation's comments to be self-centered and immature, the criticisms from my generation seemed stubborn and incurious.
We have to get beyond this.
Because this year we face an existential threat to our democracy. Our freedom to choose our leaders is imperiled by a national wave of voter suppression, widespread installation of blatantly partisan judges and grotesquely manipulated political boundaries across the country.
Freedom of the press is under assault like at no time in my lifetime by a president who embraces dictators and fantasizes about jailing journalists. The New York Times just reported that Donald Trump used the term "fake news" 273 times on Twitter in 2019, a 50-percent increase from 2018. He declared two Post reporters "shouldn't even be allowed on the grounds of the White House" and accused the Times of treason.
One party in Congress refuses to ever hold the president accountable for anything and continues, 1950s-style, to be dominated by old white men who cling to a past in which they were always on top. (That spineless behavior, I would note, is not both parties and all boomers, but a self-selected assortment of good old boys and their mouthpieces on Fox News and conservative talk radio.)
Making things even more challenging for the future of democracy is the penchant of the most rustic and probably uneducated of Trump's supporters to make chilling threats about how many guns they possess to demonstrate some crazy zealotry.
Against that backdrop, do you really think this generational squabbling is a good idea?
Because before we can act on climate change or college tuition or anything else, we first have to save democracy from Trump.
Yet the two most prominent cleavages that seem to divide Democrats relate to age - one directly, one not.
The first is the grousing about whether Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Mike Bloomberg, all past 70, are simply too old to be president. The flip side of that concerns whether Pete Buttigieg, at 37, is too young, even if he is a Rhodes Scholar and a war veteran.
The second cleavage connects less directly to age, but generally pits younger progressives who demand more radical change such as Medicare and free public college tuition for all against other Democrats - generally older ones - who define themselves as pragmatists and see the best opportunity for actual change as coming in increments, as Obama did.
Sadly, those age-linked issues, more than any other master narratives, have dominated and been divisive in the primary season thus far. One must fervently hope that those divides won't weaken the eventual Democratic nominee, whatever that candidate's age or penchant for major change.
No, what seems clear to me is that Americans across generations who share a revulsion at this obscene Trump era should look beyond intergenerational grievances and slogans.
Because confronting Donald Trump is the only conflict that really matters.

Texto completo: Del mismo modo en que Los Ángeles alberga el mayor número de mexicanos fuera de México , esta ciudad también es hogar de la comunidad iraní más numerosa que existe fuera de Irán .
Esto ha hecho que la población del área se vea especialmente afectada por la situación de tensión que existe ahora entre su país de origen y Estados Unidos , luego de la muerte de un alto militar iraní , el comandante de la Guardia Revolucionaria, Qasem Soleimani , y hasta el día de hoy, en que el presidente Donald Trump dio un discurso en el que anunció sanciones económicas para aquel país.
El vecindario de “Tehrángeles” , al oeste de la ciudad , es el principal asentamiento de la comunidad iraní en Los Ángeles. Ahí se establecieron para buscar paz , pero la muerte de Soleimaní la semana pasada revivió el miedo de una guerra.
“Hay preocupación. Se nota en las caras” , dice a Efe, Nader , un inmigrante iraní que no quiso dar su apellido precisamente por miedo.
There are half a million Iranians in the LA area. More than anywhere outside of Iran.

No sólo una guerra les podría “traer problemas” a ellos de manera indirecta . Ya desde ahora algunas personas se han visto afectadas : como lo reportó el diario The New York Times, unos 200 migrantes con residencia en Estados Unidos e incluso ciudadanos americanos fueron detenidos “de manera injusta”, en la frontera , para ser objeto de interrogatorios por parte de personal de migración.

Texto completo: Del mismo modo en que Los Ángeles alberga el mayor número de mexicanos fuera de México , esta ciudad también es hogar de la comunidad iraní más numerosa que existe fuera de Irán .
Esto ha hecho que la población del área se vea especialmente afectada por la situación de tensión que existe ahora entre su país de origen y Estados Unidos , luego de la muerte de un alto militar iraní , el comandante de la Guardia Revolucionaria, Qasem Soleimani , y hasta el día de hoy, en que el presidente Donald Trump dio un discurso en el que anunció sanciones económicas para aquel país.
El vecindario de “Tehrángeles” , al oeste de la ciudad , es el principal asentamiento de la comunidad iraní en Los Ángeles. Ahí se establecieron para buscar paz , pero la muerte de Soleimaní la semana pasada revivió el miedo de una guerra.
“Hay preocupación. Se nota en las caras” , dice a Efe, Nader , un inmigrante iraní que no quiso dar su apellido precisamente por miedo.
There are half a million Iranians in the LA area. More than anywhere outside of Iran.

No sólo una guerra les podría “traer problemas” a ellos de manera indirecta . Ya desde ahora algunas personas se han visto afectadas : como lo reportó el diario The New York Times, unos 200 migrantes con residencia en Estados Unidos e incluso ciudadanos americanos fueron detenidos “de manera injusta”, en la frontera , para ser objeto de interrogatorios por parte de personal de migración.

Texto completo: MEDIA
Metro Boston free paper closes after 19 years The free Metro Boston paper is shutting down after 19 years in business. A memo from publisher Ed Abrams and associate publisher Susan Peiffer issued on Wednesday said it didn't make sense to continue to operate the paper after the New York and Philadelphia Metro papers were sold. They said the Metro Boston paper lost access to “centralized resources, and a difficult decision had to be made." The Metro New York and Metro Philadelphia papers have been sold to Schneps Media, the owner of New York's other free daily, amNewYork. (Schneps is combining the two New York papers.) The Alliance for Audited Media reported that the Metro Boston's recent average daily circulation was 50,000, as of the third quarter of 2019, for editions that published Monday through Thursday. The Boston Globe owned a 49 percent stake in the Metro Boston, dating back to when The New York Times Co. owned the Globe and decided to invest in the free paper. That stake was transferred when the Times Co. sold the Globe to John Henry in 2013. — JON CHESTO
GOVERNMENT
Baker concerned about Galvin's new standards for broker-dealers Wall Street isn't happy with Secretary of State William Galvin's effort to impose a new, more stringent conduct standard for broker-dealers. Neither, apparently, is Governor Charlie Baker. The governor wrote a letter to Galvin on Tuesday, expressing concerns about Galvin's “fiduciary conduct standard" for securities brokers. Baker said his administration fears the regulation may create more confusion than clarity in the investment industry and among individual investors. Baker wrote that the rule could reduce investment services that people rely on, and could harm the business model for broker-dealers. He said Galvin's rule could also disrupt the state Division of Insurance's regulation of annuities and discourage brokers from selling municipal bonds directly to investors. Galvin also received criticism about the rule from representatives of financial companies and business groups during a public hearing on Tuesday at the State House. — JON CHESTO
TECHNOLOGY
Waltham maker of weapons-screening systems has a new CEO Evolv Technology, a Waltham-based maker of weapons-screening systems, said Wednesday that it named Peter George as chief executive officer, succeeding co-founder Mike Ellenbogen, who will remain at the company and oversee research and development. George, 60, is a veteran tech industry executive in the region who joined the company in February 2019 as chief commercial officer. He most recently served as CEO at empow, a Boston startup that makes data security management systems, and earlier at Fidelis Cybersecurity, a local company that was acquired by General Dynamics. Evolv also said it added another $6 million to the $24 million in Series C financing the company announced in October, bringing total funding to more than $75 million since it was founded in 2013. Finback Investment Partners, former Florida governor Jeb Bush's venture firm, participated in the latest investment. The company's existing investors include Bill Gates, DCVC, General Catalyst Partners, Lux Capital, and SineWave Ventures. Evolv said its systems have screened more than 50 million people for weapons at venues including Lincoln Center, Oakland Airport, Gillette Stadium, and L.L. Bean. — LARRY EDELMAN
HEALTH CARE
Cambridge Health Alliance has a new chief executive The hospital system Cambridge Health Alliance on Wednesday appointed a longtime physician executive, Dr. Assaad Sayah, as its new chief executive. Sayah has been serving as interim CEO since June, following the retirement of Patrick Wardell. He has been chief medical officer at Cambridge Health Alliance since 2013, and before that was chief of emergency medicine and senior vice president of primary care. Sayah, 58, previously worked at other Boston-area hospitals, including Brigham and Women's. Cambridge Health Alliance, which has campuses in Cambridge, Somerville, and Everett, said Wednesday that its board selected Sayah from a pool of 150 applicants. The Harvard-affiliated community health system has been in the headlines after the death of Laura Levis, a 34-year-old woman who found a locked door at CHA Somerville Hospital when she arrived early one morning in 2016, suffering from an asthma attack. She collapsed outside the hospital and later died. — PRIYANKA DAYAL MCCLUSKEY
RETAIL
Macy's closing 28 stores, including one in Leominster Macy's is closing 28 stores, including one in Leominster, as well as one Bloomingdale's in coming weeks, though the company reported some improvement in comparable-stores sales during the crucial holiday shopping season. Macy's sales at stores opened at least a year fell 0.6 percent during the November and December period, which was not as bad as most industry analysts had anticipated. Like other department stores, Macy's is struggling to adapt to a shift online by customers, and also intense competition from off-price discounters like T.J. Maxx. Macy's has pursued a number of strategies as a way to get shoppers back. That includes expanding an off-price concept at its Macy's stores called Backstage. It also recently teamed up with resale site ThredUp. The company's Bloomingdale's division has recently launched a clothing rental service. — ASSOCIATED PRESS
ECONOMY
Businesses added 202,000 jobs in December US companies added 202,000 jobs in December, led by robust hiring in construction, trade, transportation and utilities, according to a private survey. Payroll processor ADP said Wednesday that the bulk of the hiring was among smaller and mid-sized businesses with fewer than 500 employees. Hiring in November was also revised upward to 124,000, a sign that the job market was stronger than past surveys initially suggested. — ASSOCIATED PRESS
STARTUPS
Fitness class subscription business is now a unicorn ClassPass is now worth more than $1 billion, after raising new cash from investors, the startup said on Wednesday. The latest funding marks the fitness class subscription app's entry into the unicorn club of startups, as fitness companies titillate investors. The New York-based company, which lets users take classes across multiple boutique fitness studios and gyms without purchasing memberships at those locations, raised $285 million led by L Catterton and Apax Digital. — BLOOMBERG NEWS
STREAMING
Spotify developing several daily sports shows Spotify is developing several daily sports shows, a big part of the music-streaming giant's push into original podcasts, according to people familiar with the plans. One program will be a recap of the day in sports and run about 10 minutes, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the projects are still being developed. It's considering a number of options, including audio programs tailored to fans of specific teams. The company has already had success with original daily podcasts in true crime and horoscopes. — BLOOMBERG NEWS
ENTERTAINMENT
The movie business not expected to be as robust in 2020 Movie ticket sales are expected to fall again in 2020 without the full force of the Avengers to save them. After a year marked by Walt Disney Co. hits, including the biggest animated release ever in “Frozen II," a Star Wars trilogy finale, and an Avengers flick that ranks as the best-selling film of all time, 2020 will feel like a hangover, according to box-office analysts. While the year will certainly have some blockbusters, including a live-action version of “Mulan" and the Marvel installment “Black Widow," the slate doesn't include the large volume of highly anticipated franchise features that marked 2019. — BLOOMBERG NEWS

Texto completo: A group of about 25 Chinese university students and young professionals from around the country gathered in Minneapolis on Tuesday in a show of solidarity with the student who has sued billionaire Richard Liu following an alleged sexual assault in 2018.
The two dozen people, most of them women, carried supportive signs in the Hennepin County Government Center atrium. They snapped photos with the intention of posting them to Weibo, a Chinese social media site similar to Twitter, that has hundreds of millions of users.
Liu, whose Chinese name is Liu Qiangdong, is CEO and founder of JD.com, an e-commerce site similar to Amazon. He is one of the world's richest men.
He was attending a doctoral program for Chinese executives at the University of Minnesota's Carlson School of Management when he was arrested in August 2018 for allegedly raping a 20-year-old undergraduate who was attending the school. He was released, and following an investigation, Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman declined to press charges. The woman, who insists she was raped, then sued Liu.
The Star Tribune has not published the name of the student, Liu Jingyao, until now. But last month she went on the record in an interview with the New York Times, telling a correspondent that survivors of sexual assault shouldn't allow the public to shame them.
In China's social media community, she has been harshly and widely criticized. The organizers who came to Minneapolis are trying to counter that message. The activists said another purpose of their protest is to point to the similarities between the young woman's case and that of other sexual-assault victims in China.
"There are a lot of young women in China who are experiencing the same thing," said Xiaowen Liang, 27, a New York lawyer, who helped coordinate the group that showed up in Minneapolis. "They are sexually harassed, raped by people in power, but a lot of them cannot speak out for a lot of reasons."
Others turned out from other cities including Philadelphia, the San Francisco Bay Area, Seattle, Toronto and Madison, Wis.
A hearing in Liu Jingyao's lawsuit was scheduled for Tuesday, but postponed to Jan. 28. Most of the activists had already booked flights to be here Tuesday so they came anyway to show their support, said Anna Zhao, 25, a 2016 graduate of the Carlson School.
"She's a role model for us," said Serena Wang, 24, a law student in Minneapolis, and one of a handful of local Chinese activists who participated Tuesday.
Wil Florin, the woman's attorney, said his client is "enormously grateful for the outpouring of support."
A spokesperson for Liu did not respond to a request for comment.

Rev. James Parks Morton, who expanded a cathedral's identity, dies at 89

Texto completo: In an earlier era of environmental awareness, the Very Rev. James Parks Morton insisted that clergy must consider protecting the world's natural resources a key spiritual priority.
“The most profound role churches have always played is that of moral arbiter," he told the Globe in 1991. “They point to the crises and the deepest meaning of a situation. Think of the role the churches played on the abolition issue."
The environmental crisis, he added, “is an issue of that spiritual magnitude."
Rev. Morton, who formerly served as dean of the Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine in Manhattan, N.Y., for a quarter-century, died Saturday in his Manhattan home. He was 89 and had been treated for Alzheimer's disease, his daughter Polly Morton Barton told The New York Times.
During his tenure, he transformed the cathedral into a vibrant center for the arts, the homeless, circus performers, endangered animals, and interfaith engagement.
He gave over the cathedral's great stone pulpit to a variety of speakers, among them the homeless and gay people (even before they were officially accepted as clergy in the Episcopal Church). He invited Catholic priests, rabbis, imams, and leaders of other faiths. Among the guest preachers were the Nobel laureates Archbishop Desmond Tutu and Elie Wiesel.
“One Sunday morning the Dalai Lama will preach the sermon, on another occasion a rabbi teaches from the pulpit," he wrote in 1986 for an anniversary report of his Harvard College class.
Rev. Morton's efforts also expanded the church's role in the surrounding community. He opened a homeless shelter on the cathedral grounds and worked to empower the poor by helping createa program that assists people as they rebuild, occupy, and own apartments in abandoned buildings.
He also introduced the Blessing of the Animals on St. Francis Day. Elephants and llamas — as well as neighborhood dogs, cats, and goldfish (in bowls) — were brought in for the annual event. The elephants came from the Big Apple Circus, which, for a time, found its off-season home at the cathedral.
“The animals bless us as we bless them," Rev. Morton said at the 1990 ceremony. “So, in the presence of these beautiful beasts, we will pray this year for ourselves: that we may have the wisdom and the courage to be more faithful custodians of God's creation."
Rev. Morton also turned the cathedral into a cultural destination by hosting music and dance programs, including some that continue to this day.
Kusumita Pedersen, a scholar of religion who worked on interfaith programs with Rev. Morton, said social justice remained at the core of all he did: “He told me, 'My conservative wealthy donors forgive me all the social justice programs if I give them the arts.' "
For several years he brought Leonard Bernstein and the New York Philharmonic to the cathedral on New Year's Eve.
He was appointed dean of the cathedral in 1972 by the Rev. Paul Moore Jr., who was then the new bishop of the diocese. Together, they re-envisioned the church as “a medieval cathedral for New York City" that would engage the city in all its promise and problems.
At the time, New York City was in the midst of a financial crisis that almost drove it to bankruptcy. The cathedral, between Columbia University and Morningside Park, with Harlem beyond, was a symbol of the city's stagnancy. A century after its cornerstone had been laid, the building remained unfinished. What had been built was largely unused and sat on a neglected piece of property.
In 1979, Rev. Morton began a program for unemployed young residents of Harlem and Newark, N.J., to train with master stonemasons to continue construction of the cathedral towers. “We will resume building this great house of God," he said at the time, “and revive the dying art of stone craft by teaching it to the young people of our neighborhood." The program lasted several years.
“His cathedral was on the urban margin," Matthew Weiner, an associate dean at Princeton University, wrote about Rev. Morton in his doctoral dissertation about religious life in New York City, “but, through his own jagged sense of curiosity and showmanship, he transformed this crippling fact into an asset by inventing projects that involved those from the surrounding communities in inventive ways."
A native of Houston, James Parks Morton attended Phillips Exeter Academy in New Hampshire and Harvard College, from which he graduated in the class of 1951. As a senior majoring in architecture, he heard a speech by Rev. Moore that changed his life.
“He heard Paul tell the story about St. Martin giving his cloak to the poor," his daughter Polly told the Times.
After Harvard, Rev. Morton did graduate work at Trinity College in Cambridge, England, from which he received a master's in theology, and then studied at the General Theological Seminary in New York, he wrote in 1966 for his 15th Harvard class report.
Subsequently, he was a priest in Jersey City, N.J., coordinated a Joint Urban Program for the Episcopal church in New York, and directed the Urban Training Center for Christian Mission in Chicago, which encouraged greater awareness of society's needs.
“Only as the minister is himself grasped by the realities of life may he teach his flock to make decisions as members of the people of God," he told the Globe in 1965.
In addition to his daughter Polly, Rev. Morton leaves his wife, Pamela Taylor Morton, whom he married in 1954; two other daughters, Sophia and Maria; eight grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren. A fourth daughter, Hilary Morton Shontz, died in 2010.
His funeral will be held at 6 p.m. Saturday in the cathedral.
Rev. Morton stepped down as dean of the cathedral at the end of 1996 and founded the Interfaith Center of New York, which promotes mutual understanding among religions.
Years before climate change became a key matter for political campaigns, Rev. Morton said the environmental crisis was also “a religious issue."
In the 1991 Globe interview, he called it “one of the most sacred issues there is. We have been bad stewards.
“We are destroying God's creation."

Texto completo: Following the death of top Iranian Gen. Qasem Soleimani on Jan. 3, a number of unverified and false posts have spread widely on the internet.
The surge of traffic resulting from Soleimani's death mixed with worries of a potential war caused the U. S. Selective Service's website to go down.
The agency tweeted Jan. 3: "Due to the spread of misinformation, our website is experiencing high traffic volumes at this time. "

Since the news of Soleimani's death, we've compiled a list of some of the false news that has appeared across social media and the web.
1. Trump didn't tweet about the draft
A screenshot of a tweet from President Donald Trump circulated widely on Facebook and Twitter indicating the start of a draft.
The tweet is fake. Trump has made no mention of a draft in connection to conflicts with Iran.
2. Fraudulent texts of U. S. Army request to enter the military draft
After a U. S. drone strike killed Soleimani, speculation about a potential war rose. Soon after, images of alleged text messages were shared on the web of what appeared to be official requests from the U. S. Army to enter the draft.
In a tweet Jan. 8, the U. S. Army noted the messages were fraudulent.
"Fact check: The U. S. Army is NOT contacting anyone regarding the draft. If you are receiving texts, phone calls or direct messages about a military draft, they are not official communications from the U. S. Army"

Cyberwar with Iran: How vulnerable is America?
Read Trump's remarks on Iran: 'Iran will never be allowed to have a nuclear weapon. '
3. A doctored photo of President Barack Obama shaking hands with Hassan Rouhani

A photo of former President Barack Obama shaking hands with Hassan Rouhani was tweeted by U. S. Rep, Paul Gosar, R-Ariz. , on Jan. 6.
"The world is a better place without these guys in power," Gosar wrote.
The image is a doctored photo from a 2015 ad associated with a super PAC in support of U. S. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis. . The original image, reported by the New York Times, was taken in 2011 and shows Obama shaking hands with then-Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in Bali.
4. Outdated images claiming Iranian attacks
These images spread as some people on Twitter unwittingly shared the dated images, which apparently were originally posted with a Jan. 8 story by Iranian news agency, IRNA.
This shared photo claimed to capture recent Iranian attacks on Ayn al Assad, an Iraqi Armed Forces and United States armed forces base in Iraq's Anbar province, but is actually a photo from Nov. 14, cited by a Google reverse search, that captures flames from Israeli missiles that struck in Gaza, not Iraq.
This image was perceived to be the first of the Sepah ballistic missile launch from Iran. In reality, this image is of smoke trails from ballistic missiles launched by Iran toward Syria on Oct. 1, 2018, according to a Google reverse search.
5. Resurfaced fake tweet from Rep. Rashida Tlaib
Early last year, a social media post spread widely claiming Rep. Rashida Tlaib tweeted on Jan. 4: Americans have spent decades raping and pillaging my people. What goes around comes around. #FridayFeeling. " The tweet was exposed to be a hoax.
The fake post has since resurfaced in a viral meme including a screenshot of the fake tweet with a social media user stating Tliab is “anti-american” and "should not be in office. ” The meme also noted at the bottom: This was her comment on the Protesters Siege of the U. S. Embassy in Iraqi. ”
Facebook has since flagged the post as false information.

Locals rally around Australia as wildfires rage

Texto completo: The images from Australia broke Adele Ohki's heart: burnt orange skies and animals fleeing runaway wildfires. Ohki was so overwhelmed by the scenes of her home country engulfed in flames that she felt compelled to act.
Ohki, who lives in Arlington, came across the Animal Rescue Craft Guild, an international organization requesting donations of handmade pouches and blankets for animals orphaned and displaced by the fires. Hand-sewn items include kangaroo pouches, snake nests, and bat wraps to donate to Australian animal groups such as the Rescue Collective.
“I am not an activist. This is a huge first for me," said Ohki, a native of the Australian capital, Canberra, who works as a violin and viola instructor at the Conservatory Lab Charter School in Boston. “I just couldn't sit back and not do anything."
Ohki is among the many New Englanders inspired to help Australia as devastating fires sweep through large swaths of the country. At least 25 people have died, millions of acres of land have burned, and an estimated billion animals have perished.
Sam Jackson, an Australia native who moved to Boston 12 years ago, was similarly moved by harrowing accounts of the fires inching closer to his friends and family. Jackson runs KO Catering and Pies, an Australian-inspired restaurant in East Boston.
“At first, the overwhelming feeling of sadness and shock made me feel helpless and in many ways useless," Jackson said. “However, I knew that sitting around doing nothing and feeling sorry wasn't going to help."
That's when he realized that, with his connections to the local restaurant scene, “there was a platform for us to DO something."
Jackson asked restaurateurs and chefs if they would be interested in supporting Australia from Boston. Overnight, “Boston Barbie for Bushfire Support" was born.
“The community support in Boston is so remarkable," Jackson said. “I'm so thankful for people's generosity and the least I can do is offer an outlet to be generous."
Jackson believes that barbies, Australian slang for a barbecue, are more about community and connections than food. Proceeds will benefit the Australian Red Cross, the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, the World Wildlife Fund, Australian Wildlife Rescue Organisation, the New South Wales Rural Fire Service, and others.
“We want to show the people of Australia that they have so much love and support all the way over here," he said.
The barbie will be held Jan. 28 at Capo Restaurant and Supper Club in South Boston. A raffle and silent auction are planned.
More than 20 local restaurateurs and chefs are participating, including John Ross from The Oyster Bar at Encore Boston Harbor casino, Ming Tsai from Blue Dragon, and Nathan Gould from O Ya. Tickets are available on Eventbrite.
“We have been just absolutely blown away by the outpouring of support from local people looking for ways to help," Jackson said. “Our greatest power is our strength in numbers."
Jackson remains hopeful that professional sports teams such as the Red Sox and Celtics will also contribute, ideally through matching donations.
For Ohki, bats didn't cross her mind before the wildfires. But she quickly realized their vital role in re-pollinating land and allowing new foliage to grow.
Hand-sewn items such as bat wraps allow the animals to nestle securely and keep warm.
“We can make those wraps. We can fill those pouches. We can do that here," Ohki said. “We don't have to do that in Australia."
After joining the Animal Rescue Craft Guild as an organizer, Ohki quickly posted requests for crocheted items to her local community groups and forums. She then linked up with other concerned people on Facebook and American Rescue Crafters Connect, an online group working with the craft guild.
Danielle Letourneau, a Canadian who works on the Lewiston campus of the University of Southern Maine, was also drawn to the online crochet movement to send relief for Australian animals. On Saturday, she became the 10th member of American Rescue Crafters Connect. By Tuesday afternoon, the group had swelled to more than 30,000 members.
While she acknowledges the value of monetary donations, Letourneau also emphasizes the importance of fiber arts.
“Those of us who don't have a heck of a lot of funds but have a heck of a lot of fabric or yarn . . . this is something we can do," she said. “This is a call for help for handmade items, especially crochet, that can only be done by hand."

Clinton Backer at Facebook Debunks Clinton Claims; Plus, Chelsea shows Hunter that you don't have to fly to Ukraine to get rich.

Texto completo: Former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and politicians like Rep. Adam Schiff (D., Calif.) may cling to the discredited belief that Donald Trump and Russia used social media to rig the 2016 election. But liberals in a position to know still aren't buying it.
The New York Times reports that it has obtained a recent internal memorandum from senior Facebook executive Andrew Bosworth. According to the text of the memo published by the Times, Mr. Bosworth throws cold water on a favorite conspiracy theory of the political left:
So was Facebook responsible for Donald Trump getting elected? I think the answer is yes, but not for the reasons anyone thinks. He didn't get elected because of Russia or misinformation or Cambridge Analytica. He got elected because he ran the single best digital ad campaign I've ever seen from any advertiser. Period.
Cambridge Analytica was a political consulting firm and Trump campaign vendor which was accused of using personal data about Facebook users without their knowledge. The Federal Trade Commission recently settled a case with some of those involved, who agreed to destroy the data they collected and be honest with users in the future about data collection. The memo from Facebook's Mr. Bosworth continues:
To be clear, I'm no fan of Trump. I donated the max to Hillary. After his election I wrote a post about Trump supporters that I'm told caused colleagues who had supported him to feel unsafe around me (I regret that post and deleted shortly after).
But [Trump campaign digital media chief Brad Parscale] and Trump just did unbelievable work. They weren't running misinformation or hoaxes. They weren't microtargeting or saying different things to different people. They just used the tools we had to show the right creative to each person. The use of custom audiences, video, ecommerce, and fresh creative remains the high water mark of digital ad campaigns in my opinion.
"Creative" is a noun in the marketing world, used to describe the particular advertisements designed to deliver messages. Mr. Bosworth fears that Team Trump is still really good at creating them and therefore he fears that Mr. Trump may win again. "As a committed liberal I find myself desperately wanting to pull any lever at my disposal to avoid the same result. So what stays my hand?," asks Mr. Bosworth. He writes, "I find myself thinking of the Lord of the Rings at this moment. Specifically when Frodo offers the ring to Galadrial and she imagines using the power righteously, at first, but knows it will eventually corrupt her. As tempting as it is to use the tools available to us to change the outcome, I am confident we must never do that or we will become that which we fear."
This column is skeptical that Facebook decides the outcomes of U.S. elections, but applauds Mr. Bosworth's effort to encourage his Silicon Valley colleagues to act with integrity. Also encouraging is that he's just the latest Valley resident to attempt to provide a reality check to anti-Trump partisans.
Readers may recall Google CEO Sundar Pichai's December, 2018 visit to the House Judiciary committee. That's when Chairman Jerry Nadler (D., N.Y.) asked if Google knew "the full extent to which its online platforms were exploited by Russian actors in the election two years ago".
Mr. Pichai reported that after a thorough investigation his company had discovered "two main ad accounts linked to Russia" which had spent on Google advertising a grand total of... $4,700. This amounted to roughly 1/234,000th of what Mrs. Clinton spent on advertising during the 2016 campaign.
Meanwhile over at Facebook, the number seems to have been larger but still tiny in comparison to overall political advertising. Writes Mr. Bosworth:
$100,000 in ads on Facebook can be a powerful tool but it can't buy you an American election, especially when the candidates themselves are putting up several orders of magnitude more money on the same platform (not to mention other platforms).
Instead, the Russians worked to exploit existing divisions in the American public for example by hosting Black Lives Matter and Blue Lives Matter protest events in the same city on the same day. The people who shows (sic) up to those events were real even if the event coordinator was not. Likewise the groups of Americans being fed partisan content was (sic) real even if those feeding them were not. The organic reach they managed sounds very big in absolute terms and unfortunately humans are bad at contextualizing big numbers. Whatever reach they managed represents an infinitesimal fraction of the overall content people saw in the same period of time and certainly over the course of an election across all media.

Did Hunter Biden Need to Go All the Way to Ukraine?
Hillary Clinton may remain confused about what happened in 2016 but her family continues to thrive financially. Ed Lin reports in Barron's that daughter Chelsea Clinton's stock in Internet company IAC is now worth $9 million.
IAC's chairman is Barry Diller, a longtime donor to the campaigns of Democratic politicians, including the Clintons. Chelsea Clinton serves on the board of IAC and according to Mr. Lin, her board tenure has been lucrative:
Clinton, who has been an IAC director since 2011, receives an annual $50,000 retainer and $250,000 in restricted IAC stock units, or RSUs. As of Dec. 31, she owned the equivalent of 35,242 IAC shares, consisting of 29,843 shares and 5,399 share units under a deferred-compensation plan, according to a form she filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Share units convert to stock when an IAC director leaves the board.

Older People Need Geriatricians. Where Will They Come From?

Texto completo: Linda Poskanzer was having a tough time in her late 60s.
“I was not doing well emotionally,” she recalled. “Physically, I didn’t have any stamina. I was sleeping a lot. I wasn’t getting to work.”
A therapist in Hackensack, New Jersey, Poskanzer was severely overweight and grew short of breath after walking even short distances. Her house had become disorganized, buried in unsorted paperwork. The antidepressant she was taking didn’t seem to help.
Her son, visiting from Florida, called his sisters and said, “Mommy needs an intervention.”
One of her daughters made an appointment with a geriatrician - a physician who specializes in the care of older adults. Dr. Manisha Parulekar, now chief of geriatrics at Hackensack University Medical Center, suggested her new patient take action on several fronts. She arranged for a sleep study, which found that Poskanzer suffered from apnea. She prescribed a different antidepressant and physical therapy in a pool to help rebuild her stamina.
And weight loss. Eventually, the geriatrician agreed that bariatric surgery made sense. Over nine months, Poskanzer lost 75 pounds; she has shed another 15 since.
Now about to turn 80, Poskanzer is still receiving therapy, 30 hours each week, feels “full of spirit” and continues to see her geriatrician every four months. “She sits and talks, which a lot of doctors don’t do anymore,” Poskanzer said. “And she knows me. I feel very well taken care of.”
Testimonials like this spotlight the rising need for geriatricians. These doctors not only monitor and coordinate treatment for the many ailments, disabilities and medications their patients contend with, but also help them determine what’s most important for their well-being and quality of life.
Patients like Poskanzer often can’t easily find geriatricians like Parulekar, however. As the nation’s older population surges, the gap between need and supply has steadily widened, and a persistent shortage of geriatricians has troubled the medical profession for years.
Geriatrics became a board-certified medical specialty only in 1988. An analysis published in 2018 showed that over 16 years, through the academic year 2017-18, the number of graduate fellowship programs that train geriatricians, underwritten by Medicare, increased to 210 from 182. That represents virtually no growth when adjusted for the rising U.S. population. “It’s basically stagnation,” said Aldis Petriceks, the study’s lead author, now a medical student at Harvard.
Moreover, geriatrics fails to attract enough young doctors to the graduate fellowships it does offer. Leaving aside geriatric psychiatry, more than a third of 384 slots went unfilled last year, the American Geriatrics Society reports.
If one geriatrician can care for 700 patients with complex medical needs, as a federal model estimates, the nation will need 33,200 such doctors in 2025. It has about 7,000, only half of them practicing full time.
Why do so few residents choose to specialize in geriatrics? Though salaries are rising, total compensation (wages along with certain benefits) for geriatricians in 2018 averaged $233,564, according to the Medical Group Management Association. Anesthesiologists earned twice as much; radiologists and cardiologists topped $500,000.
“These are smart people looking at economic reality,” said Dr. Mark Supiano, a geriatrician and researcher at VA Salt Lake City Health Care System. Treating patients covered by Medicare, which pays less than commercial insurance, is a slow way to repay medical school loans.
Nor does the field offer much glamour or the prospect of medical heroics. “Having patience, having good communication skills, it’s a different personality than being a surgeon,” Supiano acknowledged. Yet a much-cited 2009 survey of 42 medical specialties found that geriatricians reported higher career satisfaction than most.
Not every older person needs a geriatrician, but the federal model estimates that 30% of the over-65 population does. This is especially true “when someone has three or more chronic conditions and is over 85,” said Nancy Lundebjerg, chief executive of the American Geriatrics Society.
That describes Dorothy Lakin, 93, whose recent medical history includes heart failure, macular degeneration, falls, colon cancer and heart valve surgeries, and a stroke.
“She’s had a zillion trips to the ER, one after another,” said her daughter Mary Ellen Lakin, 70, who lives in Newton, Massachusetts. “I thought, ‘Let’s see if there’s a way to make her life easier.’ ”
Mary Ellen Lakin found her way to Dr. Laura Nelson Frain, a geriatrician at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, who has gently steered mother and daughter through the past year. She reduced the number of medications Dorothy Lakin took and the specialists she saw, stayed in touch with Mary Ellen and sent a geriatric nurse-practitioner to make house calls.
“It’s less of ‘Let’s order this med, let’s order that procedure,’ more of a holistic approach,” Mary Ellen Lakin said. Her mother recently entered hospice care.
Still, given the numbers, “we’re not going to address this growing older population through some miraculous influx of specialized geriatricians,” Petriceks said.
Leaders in geriatrics agree, and while they continue working to bolster their numbers, they’re also adopting other strategies. Dr. Mary Tinetti, chief of geriatrics at the Yale School of Medicine, has called for geriatricians to serve as “a small, elite workforce” who help train whole institutions in the specifics of care for older adults.
“The most important thing geriatricians can do is make sure all their other colleagues” understand these patients’ needs, she said, including nurse-practitioners, physician assistants and pharmacists.
To some extent, this is already happening. Medical associations representing cardiologists and oncologists have begun focusing on older patients, Lundebjerg pointed out. Health systems are adopting age-friendly approaches, like specialized emergency rooms. The American College of Surgeons’ new verification program sets standards hospitals should meet to improve results for older patients.
Last month the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions voted to reauthorize a $41 million program that educates health professionals in geriatrics; it awaits a floor vote. A companion bill has already passed the House of Representatives. “It’s money very well spent,” Tinetti said.
Health professionals increasingly recognize that if they’re not in pediatrics, they will be seeing lots of seniors, whatever their specialty. A 2016 American Medical Association survey, for example, found that close to 40% of patients treated by internists and general surgeons were Medicare beneficiaries.
“Our medical students are living and breathing this,” said Supiano, who also teaches at the University of Utah School of Medicine. He warns them, “If you don’t like taking care of older people, find another career.”

Texto completo: Linda Poskanzer was having a tough time in her late 60s.
“I was not doing well emotionally,” she recalled. “Physically, I didn’t have any stamina. I was sleeping a lot. I wasn’t getting to work.”
A therapist in Hackensack, New Jersey, Poskanzer was severely overweight and grew short of breath after walking even short distances. Her house had become disorganized, buried in unsorted paperwork. The antidepressant she was taking didn’t seem to help.
Her son, visiting from Florida, called his sisters and said, “Mommy needs an intervention.”
One of her daughters made an appointment with a geriatrician - a physician who specializes in the care of older adults. Dr. Manisha Parulekar, now chief of geriatrics at Hackensack University Medical Center, suggested her new patient take action on several fronts. She arranged for a sleep study, which found that Poskanzer suffered from apnea. She prescribed a different antidepressant and physical therapy in a pool to help rebuild her stamina.
And weight loss. Eventually, the geriatrician agreed that bariatric surgery made sense. Over nine months, Poskanzer lost 75 pounds; she has shed another 15 since.
Now about to turn 80, Poskanzer is still receiving therapy, 30 hours each week, feels “full of spirit” and continues to see her geriatrician every four months. “She sits and talks, which a lot of doctors don’t do anymore,” Poskanzer said. “And she knows me. I feel very well taken care of.”
Testimonials like this spotlight the rising need for geriatricians. These doctors not only monitor and coordinate treatment for the many ailments, disabilities and medications their patients contend with, but also help them determine what’s most important for their well-being and quality of life.
Patients like Poskanzer often can’t easily find geriatricians like Parulekar, however. As the nation’s older population surges, the gap between need and supply has steadily widened, and a persistent shortage of geriatricians has troubled the medical profession for years.
Geriatrics became a board-certified medical specialty only in 1988. An analysis published in 2018 showed that over 16 years, through the academic year 2017-18, the number of graduate fellowship programs that train geriatricians, underwritten by Medicare, increased to 210 from 182. That represents virtually no growth when adjusted for the rising U.S. population. “It’s basically stagnation,” said Aldis Petriceks, the study’s lead author, now a medical student at Harvard.
Moreover, geriatrics fails to attract enough young doctors to the graduate fellowships it does offer. Leaving aside geriatric psychiatry, more than a third of 384 slots went unfilled last year, the American Geriatrics Society reports.
If one geriatrician can care for 700 patients with complex medical needs, as a federal model estimates, the nation will need 33,200 such doctors in 2025. It has about 7,000, only half of them practicing full time.
Why do so few residents choose to specialize in geriatrics? Though salaries are rising, total compensation (wages along with certain benefits) for geriatricians in 2018 averaged $233,564, according to the Medical Group Management Association. Anesthesiologists earned twice as much; radiologists and cardiologists topped $500,000.
“These are smart people looking at economic reality,” said Dr. Mark Supiano, a geriatrician and researcher at VA Salt Lake City Health Care System. Treating patients covered by Medicare, which pays less than commercial insurance, is a slow way to repay medical school loans.
Nor does the field offer much glamour or the prospect of medical heroics. “Having patience, having good communication skills, it’s a different personality than being a surgeon,” Supiano acknowledged. Yet a much-cited 2009 survey of 42 medical specialties found that geriatricians reported higher career satisfaction than most.
Not every older person needs a geriatrician, but the federal model estimates that 30% of the over-65 population does. This is especially true “when someone has three or more chronic conditions and is over 85,” said Nancy Lundebjerg, chief executive of the American Geriatrics Society.
That describes Dorothy Lakin, 93, whose recent medical history includes heart failure, macular degeneration, falls, colon cancer and heart valve surgeries, and a stroke.
“She’s had a zillion trips to the ER, one after another,” said her daughter Mary Ellen Lakin, 70, who lives in Newton, Massachusetts. “I thought, ‘Let’s see if there’s a way to make her life easier.’ ”
Mary Ellen Lakin found her way to Dr. Laura Nelson Frain, a geriatrician at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, who has gently steered mother and daughter through the past year. She reduced the number of medications Dorothy Lakin took and the specialists she saw, stayed in touch with Mary Ellen and sent a geriatric nurse-practitioner to make house calls.
“It’s less of ‘Let’s order this med, let’s order that procedure,’ more of a holistic approach,” Mary Ellen Lakin said. Her mother recently entered hospice care.
Still, given the numbers, “we’re not going to address this growing older population through some miraculous influx of specialized geriatricians,” Petriceks said.
Leaders in geriatrics agree, and while they continue working to bolster their numbers, they’re also adopting other strategies. Dr. Mary Tinetti, chief of geriatrics at the Yale School of Medicine, has called for geriatricians to serve as “a small, elite workforce” who help train whole institutions in the specifics of care for older adults.
“The most important thing geriatricians can do is make sure all their other colleagues” understand these patients’ needs, she said, including nurse-practitioners, physician assistants and pharmacists.
To some extent, this is already happening. Medical associations representing cardiologists and oncologists have begun focusing on older patients, Lundebjerg pointed out. Health systems are adopting age-friendly approaches, like specialized emergency rooms. The American College of Surgeons’ new verification program sets standards hospitals should meet to improve results for older patients.
Last month the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions voted to reauthorize a $41 million program that educates health professionals in geriatrics; it awaits a floor vote. A companion bill has already passed the House of Representatives. “It’s money very well spent,” Tinetti said.
Health professionals increasingly recognize that if they’re not in pediatrics, they will be seeing lots of seniors, whatever their specialty. A 2016 American Medical Association survey, for example, found that close to 40% of patients treated by internists and general surgeons were Medicare beneficiaries.
“Our medical students are living and breathing this,” said Supiano, who also teaches at the University of Utah School of Medicine. He warns them, “If you don’t like taking care of older people, find another career.”

Texto completo: George Julius Perles, the polarizing and outspoken former Michigan State University football player, coach, athletic director and Board of Trustees member, died late Tuesday night, the school announced.
Perles also was know for being an assistant with the dominant Pittsburgh Steelers teams of the 1970s that won four Super Bowls and coaching in the USFL, a rival league to the NFL.
Perles was born July 16, 1934, in Detroit’s west side and was a football and baseball star at Detroit Western. He earned all-state football honors as a junior and senior and graduated in 1953, then briefly attended the University of Tennessee before returning to Detroit and joining the Army with a number of his friends.
He served in the Army from 1954-56 and was stationed in Hawaii, where he continued to play football. After returning from active duty, Perles joined Duffy Daugherty’s football team at Michigan State as an offensive and defensive tackle in the fall of 1956. Perles lettered for the Spartans in 1958 before a knee injury ended his playing career.
“He's a tough kid. It was a tough neighborhood,” Danny Boisture, a former Daugherty assistant coach who grew up in the same neighborhood as Perles, told the Free Press in 1982. “He was a great football player, a typical red-blooded young kid of that day. ”
After getting his bachelor’s degree from Michigan State in 1960, Perles joined Daugherty’s staff as a graduate assistant. He received his master’s in educational administration in 1961 and went on to coach high school football first at St. Rita’s in Chicago and St. Ambrose High in Grosse Pointe Park, Michigan, which went 23-2 in three seasons and won the 1962 City League championship with Perles as head coach.
After a two-year stint as an assistant coach at the University of Dayton, Perles returned to Michigan State and Daugherty’s staff, coaching defensive line from 1967-71.
Tom Landau, one of Perles' players at St. Ambrose, told the New York Times in 1990 that Perles was a “streets of Detroit guy. ”
“That's where he was from and it shaped the way he acted,'' Landau told the Times. “He was tough, but he was very loyal. If he thought you were with him, he stuck by you. But if he thought you weren't, you were his enemy for life. ”
Seeing Roses
Chuck Noll, the legendary NFL coach, poached Perles in 1972 to coach the defensive line of the Pittsburgh Steelers. Perles became one of the architects of Pittsburgh's vaunted Steel Curtain defense that dominated the decade, with his innovative stunt 4-3 formation helping the Steelers win four Super Bowls. He became Noll’s defensive coordinator in 1978 and assistant head coach from 1979-82.
That led Perles to a head coaching job with the Philadelphia Stars of the upstart United States Football League. He helped build the team throughout 1982 but never coached a game when the league began in the spring of 1983 because his alma mater came calling for the job he coveted most.
Michigan State hired Perles to replace Muddy Waters on Dec. 3, 1982, giving the 48-year-old a five-year contract three years after he was bypassed by Waters for the job. He also applied for the job in 1976, after Denny Stolz was forced out and the school was placed on probation.
“That's the only college job in the country I would be interested in,” Perles said in 1976. “I think anybody is interested in going home if he's not running away from something. And I'm definitely not running away from anything. ”
The decision to hire Perles resulted in a $1 million lawsuit by the Stars that was settled out of court, reportedly with Michigan State paying the USFL team $175,000. It foreshadowed the mercurial relationship between the university and Perles over the next three decades.
Perles promised to lead the Spartans, coming off a 2-9 season in Waters’ final year, back to the national respectability it enjoyed during Daugherty’s tenure.
“If we make all decisions based on winning the Rose Bowl,” Perles told the Free Press in late 1982, “we won't make a poor decision. ”
He guided the Spartans to the 1988 Rose Bowl, their first since 1966, along with the 1987 Big Ten title that was their first since 1978. They also won a share of the 1990 conference championship, which would be Michigan State’s last until Mark Dantonio earned a share in 2010.
However, Perles’ tenure also was marked with a number of ups and downs.
It included allegations of steroid abuse — documented in the book, “Behind the Green Curtain: The Sacrifice of Ethics and Academics in Michigan State Football’s Rise to National Prominence” — that included offensive lineman Tony Mandarich, the No. 2 pick in the 1989 NFL draft.
On a few occasions, Perles leveraged his own NFL connections into more power at Michigan State. He reportedly was going to take over the Green Bay Packers after the Spartans won the Big Ten in 1987, only to stay. He then used talks with the New York Jets in 1990 to sway his alma mater into giving him the athletic director job along with his football responsibilities.
“There are a lot of people who take offense at my dad's personality," Perles’ son, John, told the Free Press in 1982, before Michigan State hired his father. “He's not exactly a soft-spoken guy. There are always a few people overwhelmed by his aggressiveness. ”
Perles parlayed the Jets offer into a 10-year deal as football coach and athletic director that did not last. His stint as athletic director ended in 1992 after friction with then-president John DiBiaggio, who demanded Perles pick one job or the other. Perles then was fired as football coach by ensuing president Peter McPherson near the end of the 1994 season.
In 12 seasons, Perles was 73–62–4 overall and 58–37–2 in the Big Ten. However, he was forced to vacate five wins in his final season due to the NCAA finding major violations during his tenure — though Perles never was personally implicated in the NCAA's charges of academic fraud and payments to recruits. The Spartans received four years of probation and lost nine scholarships for Perles’ eventual replacement Nick Saban, who had served as Perles’ defensive coordinator for the 1987 Big Ten title team.
Saban has gone on to win six national championships with one coming at LSU and five at Alabama. He considered Perles a mentor.
“George Perles meant a tremendous amount to not only me, but the entire Saban family," Saban said in a statement. "He was one of my mentors in this profession, and he gave me my first opportunity to be in a position of leadership as the defensive coordinator at Michigan State. George was always a great friend and someone who I turned to for advice on many occasions. I learned an incredible amount of both football and life from him over the years.
"George did an outstanding job at Michigan State building that program. He was a great leader who impacted that transformation at Michigan State from the top down. Those five years at Michigan State, which culminated with a Rose Bowl victory at the end of the 1987 season, showed us the type of foundation necessary to build a program. We are so very close to his family, his wife Sally, and their children, Kathy, Terry, John and Pat, and they are in our thoughts and prayers. It is a sad day for the Sabans when it comes to losing one of our great mentors and the fantastic memories that we had with them. ”
After being fired, Perles sued Michigan State in 1995 for breach of contract and age discrimination but eventually dropped the lawsuit two months later.
Highs and lows
In 2006, Perles ran and won a seat on the Michigan State Board of Trustees as a Democrat, and was re-elected in 2014. He served from 2007 until November 2018, when he resigned and cited health concerns following a year which included fallout from the Larry Nassar conviction, the resignation of president Lou Anna K. Simon and athletic director Mark Hollis, and scrutiny into sexual assault allegations surrounding the school’s football and basketball programs.
A Free Press investigation found then-interim president John Engler helped wipe out Perles’ nearly $200,000 debt from a gift pledge to the university days after his resignation. That situation prompted an investigation by state Attorney General Dana Nessel.
Following his stint as Michigan State coach, Perles helped create the Motor City Bowl in 1997, which reintroduced a college football bowl to Detroit (Michigan State had played in the 1984 Cherry Bowl under Perles, a game that existed for just two years).
Perles also was a staunch supporter of the Special Olympics. He joined with former attorney general Frank Kelley and Peter Secchia, a former ambassador to Italy and another Michigan State alum, to create the annual Kelley-Perles-Secchia Special Olympics Golf Classic in Lansing that began in 1987 and continued through 2018.
Among his other activities, Perles served on the board for Blue Cross Blue Shield, was a member of the selection committee for the Hula Bowl and was a contributor to the Harris Interactive College Football Poll. He was inducted into the Michigan Sports Hall of Fame in 2006.
Perles is survived by his wife, Sally, and their children Kathy, Terry, John and Patrick. They have six grandchildren.

Texto completo: An editorial from
the San Diego Union-Tribune
This needs to be the year in which a vigorous debate about online privacy takes center stage. If that happens, it will be at least partly because California's pioneering online privacy law went into effect last Wednesday. It gives residents the right to be informed about what data is being collected on them; to request that the information be deleted; and to opt out of letting companies sell this information. Businesses with annual sales of less than $25 million that obtain little online information are exempt.
As often happens, the Golden State's law is likely to be copied by many states and perhaps Congress as well. Unfortunately, the California Consumer Privacy Act is so murky that it is unclear what will result from its implementation. A recent analysis in the Los Angeles Times noted all the unanswered questions about the law: "What does 'sell' mean? How can companies be sure they're deleting the right person's data? And does simply having a website that keeps track of how many people visit each year mean you must wade into the regulatory thicket?" It's also plain that the state doesn't remotely have the resources to monitor the internet and the trillions of interactions that Californians will have online in 2020.
This vagueness - and its traditional corporate arrogance - has already inspired Facebook to announce it won't change its data-collection policies one bit. But in enforcing the new law, California Attorney General Xavier Becerra shouldn't be fazed by any company's deep pockets. A recent series by The New York Times showed that online privacy is a myth. Using information provided by a worker at one of the dozens of companies that track the every movement of consumers to get hints of what they might want to buy, The Times showed how it could track 12 million Americans - including visitors to the White House, to the Pentagon, to celebrities' homes, to hospitals, to anywhere.
The newspaper's reporting showed that contrary to claims of companies that the information is anonymized, it's easy to quickly determine the names of those being tracked by their phones. The Times raised the prospect that controls on this information are so weak that authoritarian governments - or vengeful ex-spouses - could use this data to bully or terrorize people. This may already be happening. The opportunities for blackmail are immense.
In "The Age of Surveillance Capitalism" - cited by former President Barack Obama as one of the best books of 2019 - Harvard professor Shoshana Zuboff makes the case that the massive store of information that digital companies accumulate on virtually everyone with a phone has created a mutant form of capitalism. As The Guardian wrote, this separates "the citizens in all societies into two groups: the watchers (invisible, unknown and unaccountable) and the watched. This has profound consequences for democracy because asymmetry of knowledge translates into asymmetries of power."
What will check the emergence of Google and Facebook as de facto global superpowers, seemingly answerable to no one? The world shall see. But at the least, the California Consumer Privacy Act is a landmark sign that tech companies can no longer count on the complacency of those they surveil.

Texto completo: In brief
MLB: Major League Baseball says it will investigate allegations the Boston Red Sox illegally used their video replay room to steal signs between opposing pitchers and catchers during their 2018 World Series championship season.
The claims were made Tuesday in a report by The Athletic. The website cited three anonymous sources it said were with the Red Sox during the 2018 season who said some players visited the replay room during games to get information on sign sequences.
Those sources told The Athletic that the Red Sox weren't able to do it during the postseason because of in-person monitors used by MLB in those games.
"The Commissioner made clear in a September 15, 2017, memorandum to clubs how seriously he would take any future violation of the regulations regarding use of electronic equipment or the inappropriate use of the video replay room. Given these allegations, MLB will commence an investigation into this matter," the league said in a statement.
The Red Sox said they will cooperate as MLB looks into the allegations.
"We were recently made aware of allegations suggesting the inappropriate use of our video replay room," the team said in a statement. "We take these allegations seriously and will fully cooperate with MLB as they investigate the matter."
The incident that prompted MLB's 2017 warning from Commissioner Rob Manfred to teams came after the Red Sox were fined an undisclosed sum for "sending electronic communications from their video replay room to an athletic trainer in the dugout" during an August 2017 series against the New York Yankees.
The New York Times reported that general manager Brian Cashman filed a complaint with the commissioner's office regarding that incident which included video. The newspaper said it showed a member of Boston's training staff looking at his Apple Watch in the dugout and relaying a message to players.
Manfred said at the time that future violations would be subject to more serious sanctions, including possible loss of draft picks. He said last month that he has the authority to levy even stiffer penalties.
The latest allegations against the Red Sox come after The Athletic reported last month that the Houston Astros allegedly stole signs during home games of their 2017 World Series championship season by using a camera positioned in center field.
Red Sox manager Alex Cora was the bench coach for that team and has spoken with MLB. He has declined further comment on the matter.
No. 12 Maryland grinds
past No. 11 Ohio State
College basketball: Anthony Cowan Jr. scored 20 points, and No. 12 Maryland used an unyielding defensive performance to defeat 11th-ranked Ohio State 67-55 in College Park, Maryland, and remain unbeaten at home.
Jalen Smith had 11 points and seven rebounds for the Terrapins, who have won three straight. Maryland went up by 10 on a 3-pointer by Cowan with 12:58 left and cruised to the finish.
Ohio State shot a miserable 31%, went 5 for 27 from 3-point range and committed 14 turnovers.
Both teams were ranked third in the nation at different times last month before going through a poor stretch. The Buckeyes came in with three losses in their last five games, including two straight. Maryland's descent in the poll was a result of successive defeats on the road against Penn State and Seton Hall.
Boston College upsets No. 18 Virginia: Jared Hamilton hit a tiebreaking 3-pointer with 37 seconds left and added a pair of free throws to clinch it as host Boston College beat No. 18 Virginia 60-53 and sent the defending national champions to their first Atlantic Coast Conference loss of the season.
Jay Heath scored 17 for the Eagles, who had not beaten Virginia since 2013.
Braxton Key scored 16 points with eight rebounds for the Cavaliers, who have lost two of their last four games.
Pistons' Griffin sidelined indefinitely after surgery
NBA: Detroit Pistons forward Blake Griffin is out indefinitely after having surgery on his left knee.
The 30-year-old Griffin was an All-Star last season for the sixth time. He has played in just 18 games this season and is averaging a career-low 15.5 points and a career-low 4.7 rebounds per game.
Local watch

Texto completo: Welcome to my annual review of the top news of a feather.
The 2019 birding year wasn’t boring, that’s for sure. Birds drew the national spotlight; drama and history played out on a Chicago beach; and a series of rare sightings sent local birders scrambling for their binoculars, scopes and car keys.
Like a dark cloud, one story overshadowed all the others. In September, the journal Science revealed that breeding bird populations in the U.S. and Canada are tanking — down 29 percent since 1970. About 3 billion fewer birds are in the air than 50 years ago. Researchers at seven institutions, including the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, co-authored the study.
Birders have long known certain species are in decline, some clearly inching toward extinction. But the magnitude of loss caught even the experts off guard, as did the news that so-called "common" birds such as blue jays and red-winged blackbirds are suffering, too.
Mainstream media jumped on it, owing that birds are an indicator of overall ecosystem health. "The mass disappearance of North American birds is a dire warning about the planet’s well-being," The New York Times said.
Study details, including reasons for the decline and "7 Simple Actions to Help Birds," are online at 3billionbirds.org.
Birds are resilient creatures, one of the reasons my glass remains half full. In fact, waterfowl and raptor populations are increasing thanks to effective conservation efforts.
Avian resiliency was on full display last summer at Montrose Beach along Lake Michigan. I suspect you’ve heard a thing or two about Monty and Rose, the first piping plovers to nest in Chicago since the mid-1950s. It was the local nature story of the year, rivaled only by an alligator in the Humboldt Park Lagoon.
Some 190 volunteers from the birding community devoted more than 1,200 hours to the Piping Plover Watch, monitoring and protecting the federally endangered birds for two months on the busy beach.
Their extraordinary efforts were rewarded by the birth and successful fledging of two piping plover chicks. The siblings began their southern migration in late August.
Gov. J.B. Pritzker declared Nov. 18 to be Piping Plover Day, coinciding with the debut of "Monty and Rose," a film directed by Bob Dolgan. The first showing at the Music Box Theatre sold out, as did subsequent screenings at other Chicago venues. Watch for viewing opportunities in the Western suburbs.
Ironically, the inspiring Montrose plover story played out during a year in which the Endangered Species Act came under attack by the Trump administration. The ESA, enacted in 1973, is generally heralded as a success by Republicans and Democrats alike. We now enjoy bald eagles around DuPage County because of it.
In October, Kirtland’s warbler exited the endangered species list, further evidence of ESA’s effectiveness in helping imperiled species rebound from near-extinction.
Odd and rare But enough politics. Head-scratching bird stories are more interesting, like the Georgia family that discovered a live screech owl in their Christmas tree days after they’d brought the tree inside and decorated it with lights and owl ornaments.
In Florida, a man raising exotic birds suffered death by cassowary. Also in the Sunshine State, a rare yellow cardinal visited a backyard feeder. A gynandromorphic cardinal — half male and half female — showed up in Erie, Pennsylvania.
Pennsylvania’s other avian shocker was a snail kite, spotted in October — the first U.S. sighting of the nonmigratory raptor outside of Florida, South Carolina or Texas. Where was it seen? In Erie, of course.
In Redding, California, a fledgling red-tailed hawk was observed in a bald eagle nest along with two eaglets, all three being cared for by two adult eagles. Shockingly, the eagles settled on raising the baby hawk instead of eating it.
Sadly, in June, a car struck and killed one of the beloved Mooseheart bald eagles in North Aurora. The surviving adult male assumed full-time parenting duties.
Woody Goss witnessed a cowbird chick being fed by common yellowthroats, a male and female — and then by a catbird! It happened at Morton Arboretum in Lisle.
Wild turkeys strutting around Chicago added further proof that when it comes to birds, you just never know.
Now let’s turn to the truly remarkable sightings of 2019 — the feathered wonders that local birders went out of their way to see and photograph.
In some cases, way out their way, such as Effingham County. That’s where a western beauty, Lewis’s woodpecker, visited feeders at the Ballard Nature Center in early May. The species was a first record for Illinois, and a lifer for many who ventured to see it.
On May 9, lucky watchers in Chicago witnessed both Kirtland’s warbler and western tanager in the same area of Grant Park. The Kirtland’s stayed for a week, and those who missed the western would have other chances. For whatever reason, 2019 was a phenomenal year for vagrant western tanagers in the Great Lakes region.
Jeff Smith discovered a male painted bunting at Midewin National Tallgrass Prairie in Will County on June 2. The Technicolor songbird seldom strays so far north.
Two other rarities, little stint and ruff, caused a rush to downstate Fulton County in early August. Even further south, sightings of fulvous whistling duck tempted birders in August (Jackson County) and September (Monroe).
The first confirmed Illinois record of limpkin, a large wader rarely spotted outside of Florida in the U.S., occurred near Olney in Richland County. Birders didn’t hear about it until September, but the bird was first noticed by local homeowners in June.
A Cassin’s kingbird at Montrose, discovered by Krzysztof Kurylowicz on Sept. 22 was a new species for the state’s No. 1 hot spot.
On a frigid Halloween, Tamima Itani scoped a king eider paddling around the Northwestern lagoon. The large sea duck was well seen on subsequent days in Evanston and Chicago.
The next mega-rarity, ancient murrelet, arrived eight days later at Montrose. First reported by Bob Hughes, it was all-time species No. 347 for the site, according to eBird.
Montrose, of course, home of the Magic Hedge, is a magnet for migratory birds. And with lots of watchers, rare sightings are almost routine. Highlights in 2019 (not already mentioned) included barred owl, black tern, black-bellied whistling duck, black vulture, common gallinule, long-billed curlew, purple sandpiper, Smith’s longspur, snowy egret, Townsend’s warbler and a flyby pair of whooping cranes. Insane!

Pennsylvania’s other avian shocker was a snail kite, spotted in October — the first U.S. sighting of the nonmigratory raptor outside of Florida, South Carolina or Texas. Where was it seen? In Erie, of course.
In Redding, California, a fledgling red-tailed hawk was observed in a bald eagle nest along with two eaglets, all three being cared for by two adult eagles. Shockingly, the eagles settled on raising the baby hawk instead of eating it.
Sadly, in June, a car struck and killed one of the beloved Mooseheart bald eagles in North Aurora. The surviving adult male assumed full-time parenting duties.
Woody Goss witnessed a cowbird chick being fed by common yellowthroats, a male and female — and then by a catbird! It happened at Morton Arboretum in Lisle.
Wild turkeys strutting around Chicago added further proof that when it comes to birds, you just never know.
Now let’s turn to the truly remarkable sightings of 2019 — the feathered wonders that local birders went out of their way to see and photograph.
In some cases, way out their way, such as Effingham County. That’s where a western beauty, Lewis’s woodpecker, visited feeders at the Ballard Nature Center in early May. The species was a first record for Illinois, and a lifer for many who ventured to see it.
On May 9, lucky watchers in Chicago witnessed both Kirtland’s warbler and western tanager in the same area of Grant Park. The Kirtland’s stayed for a week, and those who missed the western would have other chances. For whatever reason, 2019 was a phenomenal year for vagrant western tanagers in the Great Lakes region.
Jeff Smith discovered a male painted bunting at Midewin National Tallgrass Prairie in Will County on June 2. The Technicolor songbird seldom strays so far north.
Two other rarities, little stint and ruff, caused a rush to downstate Fulton County in early August. Even further south, sightings of fulvous whistling duck tempted birders in August (Jackson County) and September (Monroe).
The first confirmed Illinois record of limpkin, a large wader rarely spotted outside of Florida in the U.S., occurred near Olney in Richland County. Birders didn’t hear about it until September, but the bird was first noticed by local homeowners in June.
A Cassin’s kingbird at Montrose, discovered by Krzysztof Kurylowicz on Sept. 22 was a new species for the state’s No. 1 hot spot.
On a frigid Halloween, Tamima Itani scoped a king eider paddling around the Northwestern lagoon. The large sea duck was well seen on subsequent days in Evanston and Chicago.
The next mega-rarity, ancient murrelet, arrived eight days later at Montrose. First reported by Bob Hughes, it was all-time species No. 347 for the site, according to eBird.
Montrose, of course, home of the Magic Hedge, is a magnet for migratory birds. And with lots of watchers, rare sightings are almost routine. Highlights in 2019 (not already mentioned) included barred owl, black tern, black-bellied whistling duck, black vulture, common gallinule, long-billed curlew, purple sandpiper, Smith’s longspur, snowy egret, Townsend’s warbler and a flyby pair of whooping cranes. Insane!

Texto completo: Welcome to my annual review of the top news of a feather.
The 2019 birding year wasn’t boring, that’s for sure. Birds drew the national spotlight; drama and history played out on a Chicago beach; and a series of rare sightings sent local birders scrambling for their binoculars, scopes and car keys.
Like a dark cloud, one story overshadowed all the others. In September, the journal Science revealed that breeding bird populations in the U.S. and Canada are tanking — down 29 percent since 1970. About 3 billion fewer birds are in the air than 50 years ago. Researchers at seven institutions, including the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, co-authored the study.
Birders have long known certain species are in decline, some clearly inching toward extinction. But the magnitude of loss caught even the experts off guard, as did the news that so-called "common" birds such as blue jays and red-winged blackbirds are suffering, too.
Mainstream media jumped on it, owing that birds are an indicator of overall ecosystem health. "The mass disappearance of North American birds is a dire warning about the planet’s well-being," The New York Times said.
Study details, including reasons for the decline and "7 Simple Actions to Help Birds," are online at 3billionbirds.org.
Birds are resilient creatures, one of the reasons my glass remains half full. In fact, waterfowl and raptor populations are increasing thanks to effective conservation efforts.
Avian resiliency was on full display last summer at Montrose Beach along Lake Michigan. I suspect you’ve heard a thing or two about Monty and Rose, the first piping plovers to nest in Chicago since the mid-1950s. It was the local nature story of the year, rivaled only by an alligator in the Humboldt Park Lagoon.
Some 190 volunteers from the birding community devoted more than 1,200 hours to the Piping Plover Watch, monitoring and protecting the federally endangered birds for two months on the busy beach.
Their extraordinary efforts were rewarded by the birth and successful fledging of two piping plover chicks. The siblings began their southern migration in late August.
Gov. J.B. Pritzker declared Nov. 18 to be Piping Plover Day, coinciding with the debut of "Monty and Rose," a film directed by Bob Dolgan. The first showing at the Music Box Theatre sold out, as did subsequent screenings at other Chicago venues. Watch for viewing opportunities in the Western suburbs.
Ironically, the inspiring Montrose plover story played out during a year in which the Endangered Species Act came under attack by the Trump administration. The ESA, enacted in 1973, is generally heralded as a success by Republicans and Democrats alike. We now enjoy bald eagles around DuPage County because of it.
In October, Kirtland’s warbler exited the endangered species list, further evidence of ESA’s effectiveness in helping imperiled species rebound from near-extinction.
Odd and rare But enough politics. Head-scratching bird stories are more interesting, like the Georgia family that discovered a live screech owl in their Christmas tree days after they’d brought the tree inside and decorated it with lights and owl ornaments.

Texto completo: BOSTON -- Major League Baseball says it will investigate allegations the Boston Red Sox illegally used their video replay room to steal signs between opposing pitchers and catchers during their 2018 World Series championship season.

The claims were made Tuesday in a report by The Athletic. The website cited three anonymous sources it said were with the Red Sox during the 2018 season who said some players visited the replay room during games to get information on sign sequences.

Those sources told The Athletic that the Red Sox weren't able to do it during the postseason because of in-person monitors used by MLB in those games.

"The Commissioner made clear in a September 15, 2017 memorandum to clubs how seriously he would take any future violation of the regulations regarding use of electronic equipment or the inappropriate use of the video replay room. Given these allegations, MLB will commence an investigation into this matter," the league said in a statement.

The Red Sox said they will cooperate as MLB looks into the allegations.

"We were recently made aware of allegations suggesting the inappropriate use of our video replay room," the team said in a statement. "We take these allegations seriously and will fully cooperate with MLB as they investigate the matter."

The incident that prompted MLB's 2017 warning from Commissioner Rob Manfred to teams came after the Red Sox were fined an undisclosed sum for "sending electronic communications from their video replay room to an athletic trainer in the dugout" during an August 2017 series against the rival New York Yankees.

The New York Times reported that general manager Brian Cashman filed a complaint with the commissioner's office regarding that incident which included video. The newspaper said it showed a member of Boston's training staff looking at his Apple Watch in the dugout and relaying a message to players.

Manfred said at the time that future violations would be subject to more serious sanctions, including possible loss of draft picks. He said last month that he has the authority to levy even stiffer penalties.

The latest allegations against the Red Sox come after The Athletic reported last month that the Houston Astros allegedly stole signs during home games of their 2017 World Series championship season by using a camera positioned in center field.

Boston Red Sox manager Alex Cora was the bench coach for that team and has spoken with MLB. He has declined further comment on the matter.

Dick Fleming: Journalist and civic visionary Neal Peirce left lasting impacts in St. Louis

Texto completo: With the passing of Neal R. Peirce at age 87 at the close of 2019, America lost a unique and remarkable chronicler and champion of cities and regions whose impact spanned six decades.
I worked with and admired Neal since first interviewing with him in 1978 when I served at the Department of Housing and Urban Development in Washington. He was my friend and civic mentor.
The Washington Post, where Peirce wrote a syndicated column for 35 years, cited his extraordinary role as an "urban affairs columnist who championed inclusive cities, while helping galvanize a now flourishing movement for more vital, inclusive cities." The New York Times also published an extensive tribute, praising his six-decade journalistic "spotlight on urban innovation" -- comparing him to legendary urbanists Jane Jacobs and Lewis Mumford.
Both obituaries touted Peirce for having framed and provoked dialogue about transit, education, sustainable growth, labor relations, racist redlining policies, energy conservation, affordable housing, and a host of other issues faced by America's cities and suburbs.
Time Magazine described Peirce as "the only chronicler of grassroots America."
Peirce authored a dozen books, including "The Book of America" and "The People's President" on the history of the electoral college, which he reprised in a September 2019 debate at Cooper Union's Great Hall in New York City. Weeks later, Peirce learned of his terminal illness.
Peirce's connections to St. Louis were substantial -- both through his 35 years of columns carried in the Post-Dispatch as well as his authorship of The St. Louis Peirce Report in 1997, one of an eventual two dozen Peirce Reports that included Dallas, Philadelphia, Denver, Seattle and others.
This independent, candid civic assessment of our city and region was jointly sponsored by the Post-Dispatch, the St. Louis Regional Chamber and Growth Association and the William Kemper Foundation. Following their nearly year-long set of interviews of some 1,000 St. Louisans, a team consisting of Peirce, Curtis Johnson, Ida Early and Rebecca Riley penned the 85-page report, which was published over a full week in the Post-Dispatch.
The Peirce Report set the stage for over two decades of civic reflection and action with "Call To Action" chapters titled: Area's Problems Demand a Reality Check, Vital Signs Point To Alarming Troubles for the Region, and Reversing the Bleak Trend Is An Urgent Challenge, along with hopeful ones: Region's Assets Provide a Strong Foundation, Can We Find the Collaborative Spirit? Old Concepts Are Giving Way to the New, A Timid St. Louis Civic Psyche, and To Energize the Region St. Louisans Might Take Risks and Look To the Future Instead of the Past.
St. Louis can trace some progress on a number of civic issues back to the Peirce Report, including the Missouri Historic Preservation Tax Credit program leading to the revitalization of entire neighborhoods and much of downtown and generating billions of private investment. Other initiatives that can be traced back to the report include MetroLink expansion, the 113-mile Great Rivers Greenway, Cortex and the Danforth Plant Science Center. Large-scale projects reconnecting the riverfront and downtown through both Citygarden Sculpture Park and the CityArchRiver project also have roots in the report.
Another clear example: Peirce's July 2001 syndicated column declaring, "St. Louis Could Become Biotech Leader: St. Louis is showing how a region can position itself … where the new century is headed." It concluded, "Could St. Louis, a settled old industrial city, become America's 21st century BioBelt?" Indeed, in 2019, Coldwell Banker Richard Ellis named St. Louis "one of the fastest growing life sciences markets in the nation."
The report, which I reread this week, also made clear that many of the Peirce recommendations dealing with regionalism and improving local and regional governance, addressing issues of racial equity and investing in long-neglected areas of St. Louis, and our stalled progress in metro-wide transit, are all still begging for serious, collaborative civic action.
We'd do well to return to the original Peirce Report and put into practice the lifetime of civic entrepreneurship that Peirce advanced both here and throughout the nation.

Texto completo: Sonos has a lot to lose in publicly challenging Google and Amazon.com. But on second glance, perhaps not as much as it seems.
The maker of high-end wireless speakers sued Google in federal court on Tuesday, accusing the internet giant owned by Alphabet Inc. of infringing on its patents. It also filed a similar complaint with the International Trade Commission, seeking an injunction against Google's devices such as its Home smart speakers and even its Pixel smartphones. Google and Amazon have both denied the claims.
Amazon wasn't named as a party in either complaint, but unnamed Sonos executives told the New York Times that they believe Amazon's Echo smart speakers are also infringing on its technology. Focusing on Google, they said, was to avoid battling two of the world's largest companies in court at the same time. But the article also noted that Sonos Chief Executive Patrick Spence has been in discussions to testify in Congress about his company's issues with both tech giants.
At a glance, the move seems like madness. Sonos is tiny compared with the two internet behemoths; Amazon and Alphabet each spend more just on sales and marketing expenses every month than Sonos generates in revenue for a full year.
Moreover, Sonos relies on both companies' voice platforms to keep its products competitive in a world where consumers now want their speakers to take commands—and talk back. The first Amazon Echo that launched widely in 2015 proved popular enough to crimp sales of Sonos speakers that year, even given the latter's undisputed advantage in quality.
But Sonos might be on the right side of the trend this time. Public sentiment has soured greatly against big tech over the past year. And official scrutiny has sharpened. Lawmakers and regulators across the globe are closely examining Google and Amazon, as well as Facebook, for antitrust violations. That alone could limit any retaliatory actions against Sonos, as any such move would be seen as confirming the company's gripes about the tech platforms' outsize power. Sonos made a point of noting in its complaint that Google sells many of its devices as "loss leaders" to generate future sales.
Sonos also is hedging its bets . The company recently acquired a "private by design" voice platform to develop for future products. It also has launched new devices in recent months that don't include Google's and Amazon's voice assistants, which suggests a growing distaste among consumers to put big tech's ears in their homes.
Now, Sonos just needs to get the right people listening in.

'Prozac Nation' author led wave of confessional writing

Texto completo: Elizabeth Wurtzel, whose startling 1994 memoir, "Prozac Nation: Young and Depressed in America," won praise for opening a dialogue about clinical depression and helped introduce an unsparing style of confessional writing that remains influential, died Tuesday in New York City. She was 52.
Writer David Samuels, a friend since childhood, said the cause was metastatic breast cancer, a disease that resulted from the BRCA genetic mutation. Wurtzel had a double mastectomy in 2015. After her diagnosis, she became an advocate for BRCA testing - something she had not had - and wrote about her cancer experience in The New York Times.
"I could have had a mastectomy with reconstruction and skipped the part where I got cancer," she wrote. "I feel like the biggest idiot for not doing so."
Writing about her final illness was a natural choice for Wurtzel, who had for a quarter-century scrutinized her life in relentless detail, becoming a hero to some, especially to many women of her generation and younger, but also drawing scorn. "Prozac Nation," her first book, published when she was 27, was unvarnished in its accounts of her student days at Harvard University, her drug use, her extensive sex life and more.
It divided critics.
"Wurtzel's nation is a nation of one," Karen Schoemer wrote in a dismissive review in Newsweek. "She makes only tenuous attempts to draw parallels between herself and her generation, and she randomly blames her parents, her therapists, her friends, the divorce rate, drugs and the times for her problems."
But Michiko Kakutani, reviewing the book in The New York Times, found more to like. She acknowledged that its self-pitying passages "make the reader want to shake the author, and remind her that there are far worse fates than growing up during the '70s in New York and going to Harvard."
"But," she added, "Ms. Wurtzel herself is hyperaware of the narcissistic nature of her problems, and her willingness to expose herself - narcissism and all - ultimately wins the reader over."
The book became a cultural reference point and part of a new wave of confessional writing.
Wurtzel followed her own lead with her subsequent writing, especially "More, Now, Again: A Memoir of Addiction," published in 2002. That book detailed her abuse of cocaine and of Ritalin, which she would grind up and snort. As she put it in a 2013 essay for New York magazine, "I made a career out of my emotions."
Elizabeth Lee Wurtzel was born July 31, 1967, in Manhattan. Her mother, Lynne Ellen Winters, was married to Donald Wurtzel, and until recently Elizabeth Wurtzel had assumed that he was her father. In a 2018 essay in New York, she wrote of learning that she was actually the child of an affair between her mother and photographer Bob Adelman, who died in 2016.
She grew up on the Upper East Side and began writing "Prozac Nation" in 1986, while she was a student at Harvard.
"It was originally a book about Harvard; it wasn't even about depression," she told the news website Vice in 1994. "But everything in it was about being depressed, so that changed it."
While earning her bachelor's degree she wrote for The Harvard Crimson and started an internship at The Dallas Morning News, but she lost that job amid accusations of plagiarism. After graduating she was able to get jobs with New York magazine and The New Yorker, writing about rock music, often in a way that invited derision. When Tina Brown took over as editor of The New Yorker in 1992, Wurtzel was one of her first cuts.

7-Eleven strikes back at owner who took day off

Texto completo: HIGASHI-OSAKA, Japan - The rice balls are gone. So are the juice bottles, which Mitoshi Matsumoto priced to sell early. Most of his store's shelves stand empty, but he has kept some cigarette cartons and bottles of alcohol in the hope that his long-running battle with the 7-Eleven convenience store chain will end in his favor.
The company that controls the 7-Eleven chain, Seven & I Holdings Co., terminated Matsumoto's franchise last week after he decided to close his store for a day on New Year's Day, and it has stopped supplying him.
It was the latest battle between Matsumoto and one of Japan's most well-known companies over harsh working conditions in the Japanese convenience store industry, which demands that stores stay open seven days a week, 24 hours a day, for all 365 days a year.
Matsumoto remains in business, but just barely. The screen on the ATM flashes "not in operation." His two full-time employees are ready to jump to new jobs once he finally closes, and his seven part-time employees no longer show up.
Still, he plans to stay open as long as he can.
"I want to stay in business for the sake of myself and other owners throughout the country," said Matsumoto, 57, who says he plans to continue his fight in a local court.
A spokesman for Seven & I, Katsuhiko Shimizu, said the company terminated Matsumoto's contract on Dec. 31. He denied that the termination was tied to Matsumoto's plan to close for a day, and instead cited numerous customer complaints about the store and Matsumoto's disparaging remarks about the company on social media.
Matsumoto's fight with 7-Eleven has made him famous in Japan, a country that has long struggled with a strenuous and sometimes deadly work culture.
Those strains are evident in the convenience store industry.
Japan's convenience store chains have expanded dramatically in recent years in an effort to capture market share at one another's expense.
While the expenses were minimal for the chains, the expansion took a toll on the franchisees who operate the vast majority of Japan's more than 55,000 convenience stores. Unable to find dependable workers, many owners increasingly worked themselves.
"Under the current situation, the company can have it both ways," said Naoki Tsuchiya, a professor at Musashi University in Tokyo and an expert on labor issues in the convenience store industry, who called Matsumoto "a significant figure" in the nationwide discussion over the industry.
Despite his troubles with the company, Matsumoto said he hoped a legal fight would restore his franchise and allow him to open up. He said 7-Eleven offered to pay for his remaining inventory - owners are responsible for buying their own products from the company at wholesale prices - but he refused. He wants Japan's convenience store industry to change instead.
"If I win the case, I hope more will follow and raise their voices," he said. "If I lose, many will get depressed and more afraid of 7-Eleven."

'Pig' boss cries oink-le; Restaurateur settles sex harass claim for $240G

Texto completo: The owner of a trendy West Village eatery will have to pay survivors of his alleged abuse $240,000 plus a share of profits to come in a settlement announced by state Attorney General Letitia James on Tuesday.
Several of 11 former employees who accused Ken Friedman of sexual harassment, discrimination and retaliation at the Spotted Pig restaurant voiced a sense of triumph at the end of the year-and-a-half-long investigation.
"Most people in our circumstance or worse never get justice. They live in fear, suffering in silence," Jamie Seet, the Spotted Pig's former general manager, said at a news conference in James' downtown office. "And to that we say, no more.
"I hope that the ripples felt throughout our industry and others is that people stop getting sexually assaulted and sexually harassed in the workplace by people in a position of power."
James' office found Friedman forcibly kissed employees and pressured them to send nude photos in a hostile, sexually charged atmosphere that violated city and state human rights laws.
The 11 victims will split the $240,000 sum, along with 20% of the restaurant's profits for the next decade. Friedman agreed to step down from the Spotted Pig, which will have to give managers and staff training on sexual harassment, discrimination and retaliation.
"No matter how high-profile the establishment or how seemingly powerful the owner is, today's settlement reiterates the fact we will not tolerate sexual harassment of any form in the workplace and that no one - no one - is above the law," James said.
Friedman did not admit to wrongdoing in the settlement, according to the attorney general.
"I'm sorry for the harm I have caused, and for being part of an environment where women were afraid to speak up," Friedman said in a statement sent to the website Eater, though he went on to contend, "I disagree with several of the allegations."
"I hope this agreement will bring some comfort to those former employees impacted by my behavior," the disgraced restaurateur added. "And I hope we are all able to put this painful chapter behind us."
Celebs flocked to the restaurant, which featured a third-floor VIP area sickeningly known as the "rape room." Friedman allegedly sexually assaulted longtime server Trish Nelson there in 2017, according to The New York Times.
Celebrity chef Mario Batali was also seen there kissing and groping a woman who appeared to be unconscious, the Times reported.
"Women have been the keepers of your dirty little secrets," Nelson said during tearful remarks.
"Luckily, that silence is now ended and more women are gaining the strength to address the issues that have plagued our experiences."
The saga of the Spotted Pig isn't over yet.
James said her office is looking into allegations against Batali - who has stepped away from his own restaurants and previously apologized for his behavior toward women - along with his business partner, whom she did not name; his management company, and three restaurants.
"Our work on this front is far from over," James said.
"Every individual deserves to go to work free of fear, abuse and discrimination, retaliation and harassment and sexual assault. And we won't stop fighting until this is true for everyone."

Pikesville's Edmart closes after 61 years and countless orders of 'Jewish foie gras' baltimore diner

Texto completo: "What am I, chopped liver?" The old saying would have little resonance at Edmart, a Pikesville deli where chopped chicken liver happened to be the second most popular item on the menu, according to employee Steven Gordon, who called it "Jewish foie gras."
At Edmart, he said, it was made with hardboiled egg and schmaltz, rendered chicken fat. Overhearing Gordon tell this to a reporter, cook Devon Hamilton chided his coworker for giving away the the business' secrets. But what does it matter? Gordon wondered: Edmart closed for good on New Year's Eve.
Owner Shelley Lev Wiseman, whose father helped open Edmart 61 years ago, said she wanted to spend more time with her family. "I haven't seen my grandchildren," she said. "And they just grow up so fast." Wiseman is open to selling the business, and has heard from an interested buyer, whom she declined to name. "We don't know what the future of Edmart will be."
Still, news of the closure came as a disappointment to Edmart's mostly older Jewish customer base and others who have frequented the shop.
For years, customer Ira Miller had been coming by daily for a sandwich with a side of chit chat. "The quality is always excellent," he said. The staff here became like family to him.
Politicians ate here, and so did Oprah Winfrey, when she lived in Baltimore.
"Oprah used to get her bagels sliced in threes when she was dieting," Wiseman said.
Tastes are changing, Gordon said. His own nephews are eating sushi and tacos, not corned beef on rye. "Times change, people change."
It's the latest in a wave of historic Jewish delis and restaurants in Baltimore closing, including Lenny's and Gourmet Again, which went out of business last year. And it's not just in Baltimore. According to The New York Times, there are around just 20 kosher delis in New York City, down from more than 1,500 Jewish delis in the 1930s.
Edmart's unusual name was a combination of the names of its original owners, Wiseman's New York-born father, Martin Lev, and his business partner, Ed Stern. Lev bought out his partner months after the shop opened, but he never changed the name.
Inside, little seemed to have changed from those days. Hanging on the walls were wooden placards with fake meats that likely seemed very fashionable when Edmart first opened. On the shelves were dusty jars of pickles Gordon said he didn't realize were just for show until mistakenly selling one to a customer.
As the business prepared to close and shelves began to look bare, Hamilton, the Trinidadian born chef, was still preparing orders for customers; creamed herring for the new year. When he began working at Edmart 22 years ago, he couldn't make a single Jewish dish. He learned quickly. He layered herring onto sour cream and onions for an order. "I's the only one that can make it like this," he said.
The deli's most popular dish was the brisket, which has even been featured on Duff Goldman's "Best Thing I Ever Ate." Every time the episode aired on the Food Network, a new crop of diners came in to try it.
Edmart's brisket was cooked in the same Vulcan oven that was installed a few years after the delicatessen opened on Reisterstown Road in 1958. With each use, it developed a new patina that helped flavor the meat. You could use the same recipe with the same cut of meat, and without that old oven, Gordon said, it just won't taste as good.

Texto completo: Japanese authorities on Tuesday said they issued a warrant for the arrest of Carole Ghosn, the wife of Carlos Ghosn, taking direct aim at the family of the fallen auto magnate as they seek to bring him back to the country to face criminal charges.
Prosecutors in Tokyo said they had obtained an arrest warrant for Carole Ghosn, 53, on suspicion of giving false testimony. In a written statement, they said Ghosn had testified in April that she did not know a person who was involved in Carlos Ghosn's case, even though she was in communication with that person while the person was wiring money between companies at Ghosn's request.
The statement did not disclose the identities of the person or the companies.
The Ghosn family could not immediately be reached for comment.
Carlos Ghosn, the architect of the Nissan-Renault-Mitsubishi auto empire, faces charges of financial wrongdoing in Japan. But he fled the country Dec. 29 and reappeared in Lebanon. Ghosn is a Lebanese national, and the nation does not extradite its citizens.
Carole Ghosn is believed to be in Beirut, the Lebanese capital, where she was photographed with her husband on New Year's Eve. It is not clear how a Japanese arrest warrant would affect her ability to return to the United States, which has an extradition agreement with Japan, or to travel to other countries with extensive ties to Japan.
Japanese officials prompted Interpol, the international criminal information clearinghouse, to issue what is known as a red notice, which is issued internationally for individuals wanted for prosecution or to serve a sentence. But red notices essentially function as a diplomatic request for help, not as an international arrest warrant, and they do not obligate governments to comply.
On Tuesday, Nissan broke its silence on Ghosn's flight, saying in a statement that an internal investigation found "numerous acts of misconduct," and it could continue to cooperate with authorities in investigating him.

When bitter is good

Texto completo: Many good wines have a built-in defense against being consumed by children: They are inherently bitter, a flavor that children seem genetically hard-wired to abhor.
Eventually, taste buds evolve. Young adults come to love many bitter flavors, whether in beer, dark chocolate, arugula, Negronis, coffee or tea.
Despite the prevalence of bitter flavors in popular foods and beverages, many people resist the idea that bitterness can be a positive. The old saw has it that American wine consumers talk dry but drink sweet.
The negative connotation of bitterness extends to wine descriptions. Despite the many examples of excellent wines that contain bitter flavors, no producers want to associate their wine with the word bitter. Few consumers would find such a description to be particularly attractive.
Wine marketers know that the public will flock to wines described as smooth, silky, velvety, fruit-forward, spicy, bold and rich. Bitter? Not so much.
I'm hoping that 2020 might be a year for rehabilitating the notion of bitterness in wine. I started to think about this on a trip in November to northern Italy, a land where bitter flavors seem to be built into the cuisine.
On arriving in Milan, I had dinner at Carlo e Camilla, a restaurant serving creative interpretations of northern Italian food in a beautifully restored old mill.
Seeking a bit of warming comfort on a cold, rainy night, I ordered a glass of Valpolicella Classico and was delighted with its clear-as-a-bell flavors, ringing of tart cherry and ending with a refreshing bitterness that prompted the next sip.
The next day, I finished a quick pizza lunch with an espresso, pulled and poured into a tiny cup. It was the proverbial Italian coffee experience, just enough to bolt in one go -- This one was ideal: smooth, radiant in flavor, bitter at the end and perfectly refreshing.
That night at dinner at Trattoria Masuelli San Marco, a traditional Milanese restaurant with a blessedly regional wine list, I drank an excellent Barolo Bricco Delle Viole 2007 from G.D. Vajra, vibrant and expressive with a touch of welcome bitterness as the other flavors faded away.
These beverages, though very different, had in common that punctuating bitterness. In each case, it was both cleansing and revitalizing, an acknowledgment of what had come before and a shift in attention to what would come next.
This attractive bitterness is one component of a spectrum of flavors that evolve directly from the fermentation of wine grapes. Wine can offer other forms of bitterness that may not always be so pleasing.
Tannic red wines can be astringent, a drying sensation in the mouth that can be experienced as bitter. Tannins that are part of a harmonious whole don't bother me, so long as they suit the intent of the wine.
I expect a top Barolo or Bordeaux to be tannic in youth. These tannins might be fine and barely detectable, yet firm enough to wrap up the flavors and nuances of the wines for quite a few years until they integrate. Then the youthful bitterness and astringency will largely evaporate to reveal the complexities within.
Similarly, a rustic young red from southern Italy might be robustly tannic yet still be a pleasure to drink, the astringency and bitterness of the tannins balancing out the sweet fruit.
Tannins generally come from the skins, seeds and stems of grapes, which is why white wines are rarely tannic. To provide wine with color, red grapes are crushed and macerated with their skins, and sometimes seeds and stems. To avoid color in white wines, the juice is whisked away from the pigment-bearing skins, with a notable exception.
That is the category of orange wines, white wines made as if they were reds, macerated with their skins until they take on an amber tinge. Depending on how long the juice stays in contact with the skins, these wines can become starkly tannic and quite bitter. It's all a matter of balance.
I find the welcome sort of bitterness most often in Italian reds. It doesn't matter which region or what grape, it seems to cut across both, whether Valpolicella of the Veneto, Barbera d'Asti of the Piedmont, Chianti Classico of Tuscany, the aglianicos of Campania or the Etna rossos of Sicily.
I find it in French wines, too, though not as pervasively. Good Beaujolais often has a welcome bitter component, as do the syrahs of the Northern Rhone, Bordeaux and cabernet francs of the Loire. In Spain, I sense it in traditionally made Riojas and the mencias of Ribeira Sacra.
Alcohol level plays a role, though. The higher the alcohol, particularly when you get to the range of 14.5% and above, the more likely a wine's procession of flavors will culminate in sweetness rather than bitterness. This is partly because of the elevated amount of glycerol found in high-alcohol wines. The combination of fruitiness, alcohol and glycerol contributes to a perception of sweetness, even if the wine contains no residual sugar.
The alcohol level in American wines can often provide a clue as to whether the wine will have a refreshing snappiness, of which bitterness is a component, or a flabby sweetness.
Sweet flavors of course are highly popular, whether in some of America's most expensive cult wines or in mass-produced supermarket wines. I don't quibble with anybody who enjoys them.
But stay aware of the flavors that make so many red wines so delicious, as well as other foods. Perhaps we can make 2020 a bitter year, and I mean that in the best possible way.

Trump upholds tradition of lying to Americans about war

Texto completo: Donald Trump's administration has been a fountain of lies from his first day in office. But the U.S. attack that killed an Iranian general promises to turn that fountain into a tsunami.
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo claimed the drone strike on the Baghdad airport was urgent because intelligence indicated Qassem Soleimani presented "imminent threats to American lives." But he was curiously reluctant to supply evidence.
The New York Times reported, "According to one United States official, the new intelligence indicated 'a normal Monday in the Middle East' -- Dec. 30 -- and General Soleimani's travels amounted to 'business as usual.'" The Washington Post divulged that Pompeo had been pressing Trump to kill Soleimani for months.
Why should anyone believe what the secretary of state says? He was deliberately misleading Sunday when he scoffed at the idea that Trump might order the destruction of Iranian cultural sites -- something the president had threatened before and reiterated even after Pompeo denied it.
Trump himself has been a paragon of dishonesty on Iran, even more than on most subjects. He pulled out of the nuclear deal, which he falsely said Iran was violating. Under the agreement, he said, Iran would be "free to go ahead and create nuclear weapons" after seven years. In fact, it stipulated "that under no circumstances will Iran ever seek, develop or acquire any nuclear weapons."
He tweeted that Barack Obama "gave Iran 150 Billion Dollars and got nothing." Obama agreed to unfreeze Iran's own assets, which amounted to a fraction of that amount, in exchange for the effective dismantling of its nuclear program.
Americans should know by now that when our leaders take us into wars, they will do it on the basis of disinformation. President Lyndon Johnson got the authority to escalate in Vietnam by exploiting a minor 1964 naval incident in the Tonkin Gulf to accuse North Vietnam of "open aggression on the high seas" -- which was false.
Johnson campaigned that year on a promise not to "send American boys 9 or 10,000 miles away from home to do what Asian boys ought to be doing for themselves." In 1965, he did exactly that. His successor, Richard Nixon, expanded the war with a lengthy bombing campaign in neighboring Cambodia, undertaken in secrecy.
Like Johnson and Nixon, this president and his subordinates believe that deceit is essential to gain support for military action. Mike Pence said Soleimani's killing was justified because his Quds Force assisted al-Qaida in the 9/11 attacks -- a conclusion rejected by the 9/11 Commission.
But Pence took a lesson from the Bush administration, which justified the Iraq War on the spurious claim that Saddam Hussein was responsible for the 9/11 attacks. Repetition of the charge soon convinced most Americans, though Bush himself later had to admit it was baseless.
Obama felt no compulsion to tell the truth about the war in Afghanistan, which he promised to end in his first 16 months but never did. A report by the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction quoted an Obama National Security Council official on the administration's repeated claims of progress: "The metrics were always manipulated for the duration of the war."
Obama justified his intervention in the Libyan civil war as a way to prevent the slaughter of civilians, but eventually --without saying so -- expanded the mission to regime change. It succeeded, but Libyans have gone on killing one another.
During World War I, the leftist writer Randolph Bourne argued that "war is the health of the state." What has become clear since then is that war depends on deception -- about the reasons for committing to combat, the reasons for continuing to fight when it goes badly and the reasons the effort was necessary despite its ultimate failure.
Politicians apparently realize that if citizens are to be mobilized in support of wars of choice, they must be fed a diet of lies. Even that may not work: Last summer, a Gallup Poll found that only 18% of Americans favored military action against Iran. A HuffPost/YouGov survey found that only 43% approved of the strike against Soleimani.
But if public support doesn't materialize, we can be sure the administration will concoct more fictions. There is a long history of presidential mendacity when it comes to matters of war. No one is better suited to uphold that tradition than Trump.

Bonus of museum visit? You might live longer.

Texto completo: Numerous studies have shown that art and music can help soothe chronic pain, stave off symptoms of dementia and Alzheimer's disease, and accelerate brain development in young children.
Now there is evidence that simply being exposed to the arts may help people live longer.
Researchers in London who followed thousands of people 50 and older for 14 years discovered that those who went to a museum or attended a concert just once or twice a year were 14% less likely to die during that period than those who didn't.
The chances of living longer only went up the more frequently people engaged with the arts, according to the study, which was published in December in The BMJ, formerly The British Medical Journal. People who went to a museum or the theater once a month or even every few months had a 31% reduced risk of dying in that period, according to the study.
The study controlled for socioeconomic factors like a participant's income, education level and mobility, said Andrew Steptoe, a co-author of the study and the head of University College London's research department of behavioral science and health.
"Even if you take those things into account, we still found that there is a difference in the survival of people who are involved in the arts," Steptoe said.
The study did not examine what kind of music, art or theater led to a longer life, he said. In other words, it's not clear whether your chances of living longer are improved by choosing "Die Walküre" over "The Phantom of the Opera."
But Steptoe said researchers theorized that people who expose themselves to the arts are likely to be more engaged in the world.
"We know that a sense of purpose in life is important," he said. "Being involved and excited by the arts keeps and maintains your purpose in life."
The study also noted that engaging in the arts can reduce loneliness, promote empathy and emotional intelligence, and keep people from becoming sedentary -- all factors that contribute to a longer life.
Many studies have examined the positive effects of the arts on older people.
Americans older than 55 who did not create art or go to concerts, museums or plays reported higher rates of hypertension and cognitive decline than those who did, according to a study of nearly 1,500 participants released by the National Endowment for the Arts in 2017.
The London study is believed to be the first comprehensive examination of the effects of art on mortality, Steptoe said.
From 2004 to 2005, researchers collected data from 6,710 people who responded to questionnaires about how often they went to concerts, museums, galleries, the theater or the opera.
In addition to providing personal information such as age, gender, ethnicity, marital status, educational background, profession and income, participants answered questions about their physical and mental health, how often they smoked or drank, and how much exercise they got.
Over the next 14 years, about 2,000 participants died -- a vast majority of them from illnesses related to cancer, cardiovascular disease, respiratory problems and other natural causes, according to the study.
"This study raises a number of future research questions," the authors wrote. For example, future studies could consider how engagement in the arts from a young age might affect a person's life span.
The study also did not examine whether there was any overlap with participants who actively participated in art, as by playing music, dancing or painting.
Still, the results of the study excited art and theater advocates who said they hoped the research would motivate a push to restore arts and music programs that have been cut from schools around the country over the years.
"So much of that has been destroyed," said Heather A. Hitchens, chief executive of the American Theater Wing, which funds a wide range of productions and programs.
"Too often, the arts are seen as this frill, but they really do play an essential role in our lives," Hitchens said. "Now we have a study telling us it helps us live longer. It's just yet the latest example of how powerful the arts are."
Advocates said the study was also a reminder of how critical it is for the arts to be more accessible to Americans of all incomes.
Gabriella Souza, a spokeswoman for the Walters Art Museum in Baltimore, said the study's results were not surprising.
"In terms of finding peace and tranquility in galleries, that is one of the reasons people come to our museums," she said.
The museum, which offers free admission and gets about 160,000 visitors a year, recently surveyed visitors about why they come. Twenty percent said for "peace and rejuvenation," Souza said.
"It's a real testament to how important exposure really is," she said. "You need to be able to access art to be able to appreciate it."

Texto completo: Many good wines have a built-in defense against being consumed by children: They are inherently bitter, a flavor that children seem genetically hard-wired to abhor.
Eventually, taste buds evolve. Young adults come to love many bitter flavors, whether in beer, dark chocolate, arugula, Negronis, coffee or tea.
Despite the prevalence of bitter flavors in popular foods and beverages, many people resist the idea that bitterness can be a positive. The old saw has it that American wine consumers talk dry but drink sweet.
The negative connotation of bitterness extends to wine descriptions. Despite the many examples of excellent wines that contain bitter flavors, no producers want to associate their wine with the word bitter. Few consumers would find such a description to be particularly attractive.
Wine marketers know that the public will flock to wines described as smooth, silky, velvety, fruit-forward, spicy, bold and rich. Bitter? Not so much.
I'm hoping that 2020 might be a year for rehabilitating the notion of bitterness in wine. I started to think about this on a trip in November to northern Italy, a land where bitter flavors seem to be built into the cuisine.
On arriving in Milan, I had dinner at Carlo e Camilla, a restaurant serving creative interpretations of northern Italian food in a beautifully restored old mill.
Seeking a bit of warming comfort on a cold, rainy night, I ordered a glass of Valpolicella Classico and was delighted with its clear-as-a-bell flavors, ringing of tart cherry and ending with a refreshing bitterness that prompted the next sip.
The next day, I finished a quick pizza lunch with an espresso, pulled and poured into a tiny cup. It was the proverbial Italian coffee experience, just enough to bolt in one go - This one was ideal: smooth, radiant in flavor, bitter at the end and perfectly refreshing.
That night at dinner at Trattoria Masuelli San Marco, a traditional Milanese restaurant with a blessedly regional wine list, I drank an excellent Barolo Bricco Delle Viole 2007 from G.D. Vajra, vibrant and expressive with a touch of welcome bitterness as the other flavors faded away.
These beverages, though very different, had in common that punctuating bitterness. In each case, it was both cleansing and revitalizing, an acknowledgment of what had come before and a shift in attention to what would come next.
This attractive bitterness is one component of a spectrum of flavors that evolve directly from the fermentation of wine grapes. Wine can offer other forms of bitterness that may not always be so pleasing.
Tannic red wines can be astringent, a drying sensation in the mouth that can be experienced as bitter. Tannins that are part of a harmonious whole don't bother me, so long as they suit the intent of the wine.
I expect a top Barolo or Bordeaux to be tannic in youth. These tannins might be fine and barely detectable, yet firm enough to wrap up the flavors and nuances of the wines for quite a few years until they integrate. Then the youthful bitterness and astringency will largely evaporate to reveal the complexities within.
Similarly, a rustic young red from southern Italy might be robustly tannic yet still be a pleasure to drink, the astringency and bitterness of the tannins balancing out the sweet fruit.
Tannins generally come from the skins, seeds and stems of grapes, which is why white wines are rarely tannic. To provide wine with color, red grapes are crushed and macerated with their skins, and sometimes seeds and stems. To avoid color in white wines, the juice is whisked away from the pigment-bearing skins, with a notable exception.
That is the category of orange wines, white wines made as if they were reds, macerated with their skins until they take on an amber tinge. Depending on how long the juice stays in contact with the skins, these wines can become starkly tannic and quite bitter. It's all a matter of balance.
I find the welcome sort of bitterness most often in Italian reds. It doesn't matter which region or what grape, it seems to cut across both, whether Valpolicella of the Veneto, Barbera d'Asti of the Piedmont, Chianti Classico of Tuscany, the aglianicos of Campania or the Etna rossos of Sicily.
I find it in French wines, too, though not as pervasively. Good Beaujolais often has a welcome bitter component, as do the syrahs of the Northern Rhone, Bordeaux and cabernet francs of the Loire. In Spain, I sense it in traditionally made Riojas and the mencias of Ribeira Sacra.
Alcohol level plays a role, though. The higher the alcohol, particularly when you get to the range of 14.5% and above, the more likely a wine's procession of flavors will culminate in sweetness rather than bitterness. This is partly because of the elevated amount of glycerol found in high-alcohol wines. The combination of fruitiness, alcohol and glycerol contributes to a perception of sweetness, even if the wine contains no residual sugar.
The alcohol level in American wines can often provide a clue as to whether the wine will have a refreshing snappiness, of which bitterness is a component, or a flabby sweetness.
Sweet flavors of course are highly popular, whether in some of America's most expensive cult wines or in mass-produced supermarket wines. I don't quibble with anybody who enjoys them.
But stay aware of the flavors that make so many red wines so delicious, as well as other foods. Perhaps we can make 2020 a bitter year, and I mean that in the best possible way.

Trump, Iran and that ambiguous balance on making war Another viewpoint

Texto completo: It was June 2011, and John Boehner was mad.
The House speaker told President Barack Obama that he would violate the War Powers Act if he didn't seek congressional authorization to extend American military involvement in Libya. Obama had joined the NATO-led coalition in March, and the War Powers Act requires authorization after 90 days at the most.
Boehner previously had expressed skepticism of the War Powers Act, which Congress passed in 1973 over Richard Nixon's veto. Nine years ago, however, the restive GOP House caucus demanded that Boehner send that letter to Obama.
Now a Republican president is defending an action - the killing of Iran Gen. Qassem Soleimani - against criticism from congressional Democrats. The partisan role reversal from nearly a decade ago underscores the dangerously ambiguous balance between Congress and the president when it comes to the military.
About 100,000-plus members of the U.S. armed forces have been killed in "wars" over the last 75 years without Congress declaring war. Another 200,000-plus have been wounded. Almost all of the casualties have come in Korea, Vietnam, Iraq and Afghanistan.
Yet Congress last declared war against Japan and Germany in 1941. Three years of war in Korea began with a congressional resolution allowing a response to the invasion of South Korea. Eleven years of war in Vietnam began with a congressional resolution allowing a response to an attack on a U.S. naval vessel that never happened.
The flashpoint now is Iran and whether Soleimani's death could lead to direct military conflict. Like presidents before him, Donald Trump has tried to stretch his powers as commander-in-chief as far as possible.
Example: Vice President Mike Pence made the laughable argument that the post-9/11 use of force authorization justified the drone strike on Soleimani. Pence claimed, against all evidence, that the Iranian general had aided some of the 9/11 hijackers.
Congress gave President George W. Bush that authorization. Obama used it to justify the many drone strikes against Al-Qaeda operatives that Bush's administration called "targeted killings."
Despite that authorization, Obama went to great lengths to justify the raid on Osama bin Laden in 2011. The New York Times reported that four national security lawyers worked in secret to build the case. Attorney General Eric Holder didn't learn of the raid until the day before.
And for all the Democratic criticism of Trump's failure to brief congressional leaders before the strike on Soleimani, Obama also didn't want to alert Congress to the bin Laden raid. Then he learned that CIA Director Leon Panetta had done so on his own. Had the raid failed, Obama hoped that it never would become public.
There is general agreement that presidents can act quickly to repel threats. The key point with Soleimani is whether Trump had credible evidence of an "imminent" threat. Soleimani was not a stateless terrorist leader. He was a commander of a sovereign country, and Iran has called his death "an act of war."
The wider, more important issue, is open-ended, unapproved military involvement. We're in Afghanistan 18 years after dislodging the Taliban government that had shielded Al-Qaeda. We're in Iraq 17 years after that misguided invasion began with a resolution sold on false pretenses.
In retrospect, presidents might wish there had been a congressional second opinion. Bush's quagmire led to the creation of the Islamic State. Obama has called the failure to prepare for a Libya after Moammar Gadhafi the biggest mistake of his presidency. Libya remains in a civil war.
Similarly, Trump appears to have no plan for what happens next with Iran. He started the confrontation by withdrawing from the Iran nuclear deal and imposing new sanctions. Having vowed on Twitter - in capital letters - that Iran never will obtain nuclear weapons, he may face the choice of attacking Iran to prevent the development of the weapons that Obama's deal addressed.
It is past time for Congress to revisit the 9/ 11 use of force authorization. There also should be bipartisan support to review the War Powers Act.
This long period of war through resolution has worked out just once, when George H.W. Bush got in and out of Iraq in 1991. The Constitution and the country deserve better.

Notice to Trump: Don't distort my religion

Texto completo: Last month, the headline on a front page article in the New York Times declared: "Broader Definition of Jewishness Arms U.S. in College Crackdown." By executive order President Trump, in the words of theTimes, "essentially defined Judaism as a race or national origin, not just a religion, under the Civil Rights Act...His order also expanded the definition of anti-Semitism to include some anti-Israel sentiment."
Who the hell asked him to define my religion? (I'm angry...) We will discuss that in a minute. The origin of this executive order is Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, which extends protections based on race, color or national origin. What it does not protect is criticism of religion.
First, let's talk about what Jewishness is. During the 19th century many people classified Jews as a race, which was obviously false. There are black Jews, Asian Jews and a variety of other colors as well. Others have classified us as a nationality, which is also patently false.
By nationality, I am a proud American. My "national origin" status would have to be somewhere in Eastern Europe, where my grandparents barely survived persecution from a government that excluded them from belonging to the national identity of the land.
Certainly, my "national origin" is not Israel. Sad to say, the vast majority of American Jews have not even visited Israel. Yes, I have a love of that land, but so do millions of committed Christians, based on the origins of their religion - but that does not define their "national origin."
Let's get this straight: Judaism is a set of beliefs (a variety of beliefs, since Judaism is not monolithic). That is the essence of my religion. Jewishness is also a peoplehood, a cultural community, a tribe in its broadest sense, a heritage of customs and mentality that allow a Jew to grope for guidelines to a better life and a better world. But that does not make a nation by any standards.
So how did we get here? Believe it or not, this is all part of the anti-BDS movement (Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions against Israel because of its refusal to allow an independent Palestinian government on the West Bank and Gaza). This issue is being fought out on college campuses between Jewish and Palestinian students.
The head of the Education Department's Office of Civil Rights Kenneth Marcus, whose job it is to enforce Trump's executive order, commented on the use of Title VI that, "the U.S. will hold (universities) accountable for allowing campus anti-Semitism, anti-Zionism, and/or physical or emotional harassment of Jewish students." Every American, Jew or Gentile, should be alarmed, as this is a direct attack on the First Amendment and free speech, whether one is pro or anti BDS. (For the record, I do not support BDS, but I do boycott West Bank products.)
Marcus included "emotional harassment" within his purview. This takes me back to an incident at Florida Atlantic University in Boca Raton in 2012. The Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) circulated a flyer to protest Israel having demolished 25,000 homes of Arabs in the West Bank. They posted fake eviction notices on the dorm room doors of more than 200 students to show them how it would feel to be evicted (a prerequisite to demolition).
The flyer was randomly distributed. Jews were not targeted. In capital letters it read: "NOT A REAL EVICTION NOTICE." Jewish students claimed harassment. Community response: JewishJournal headline - "Eviction notices scare students." ZOA - the notice "was anti-Semitic in nature" and "contained a modern blood libel." Anti-Defamation League - the flyer utilized "intimidation tactics." Sun-Sentinel - the flyer created "a manifestly hostile environment for Jewish fellow students." This reflected the power of the Jewish community to distort reality (shades of what is happening with Trump today).
My comment at the time in the Jewish Journal: "Let me be blunt. If students actually thought that they were being evicted, I would check their IQ scores and wonder how they were accepted in FAU in the first place. If you can't read, you shouldn't be in college."
Thanks to Trump, now my religion is being re-defined and being dragged into a political battle over Israeli government policies. I personally resent the use of American Civil Rights legislation manipulated as a tool in the arsenal of right-wing Jews and Gentiles (including Trump) in support of the Israeli government.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - American businesses and consumers, not China, are bearing the financial brunt of President Donald Trump's trade war, new data shows, undermining the president's assertion that the United States is "taxing the hell out of China."
"U.S. tariffs continue to be almost entirely borne by U.S. firms and consumers," Mary Amiti, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, wrote in a National Bureau of Economic Research working paper. The other authors of the paper were David Weinstein of Columbia University and Stephen Redding of Princeton University.
Examining the fallout of tariffs in data through October, the authors found that Americans had continued paying for the levies - which increased substantially over the course of the year. Their paper, which is an update on previous research, found that "approximately 100 percent" of import taxes fell on American buyers.
The findings are the latest evidence that voters and American businesses are paying the cost of Trump's penchant for using tariffs to try to rewrite the terms of trade in favor of the United States.
Manufacturing is slumping, a fact economists attribute at least partly to uncertainty stemming from the trade spats, and business investment has suffered as corporate executives wait to see how - or if - the tensions will end.
The United States and China have reached a trade truce and are expected to sign an initial deal this month, but tariffs on $360 billion worth of Chinese goods will remain in place. The levies, which are as high as 25%, have forced some multinational businesses to move their operations out of China, sending operations to countries like Vietnam and Mexico.
Trump and his supporters say that the United States had no choice but to resort to tough tactics to try to force China to abandon unfair economic behaviors, like infringing on U.S. intellectual property and providing state subsidies to Chinese firms.
And Trump has continued to incorrectly assert that China - not American companies and consumers - is paying the cost of the tariffs.
Tariffs may have worked as a negotiating chip to get China to the table, but recent academic research shows that leverage has come at a steep price for some American businesses and consumers.
The authors of the latest study used customs data to trace the fallout, examining import values before and after the tariffs. The research showed that the tariffs had little effect on China.
"We're just not seeing foreigners bearing the cost, which to me is very surprising," Weinstein said in an interview.
They also find a delayed effect from the tariffs, with the decline in some imports doubling on average in the second year of the levies.
That is because "it takes some time for firms to reorganize their supply chains so that they can avoid the tariffs," the authors write.
Reaction to the tariffs has varied across business sectors, however. In the steel industry, companies that export to the United States have dropped their prices - suggesting that other countries are in fact paying "close to half" of the cost of tariffs, according to the paper.
Because China is only the 10th-largest steel supplier to the United States, though, exporters in the European Union, Japan and South Korea are likely bearing much of that cost. And as foreign prices drop, domestic steel production has barely budged, which bodes poorly for hiring in the U.S. steel industry, the authors note.
"The steel industry isn't getting that much protection, as a result," Weinstein said.
In previous research, the authors found that by December 2018, import tariffs were costing American consumers and importing businesses $3.2 billion per month in added taxes and an additional $1.4 billion per month in efficiency losses. They did not update those numbers in the latest study.

Texto completo: There were a record-breaking 92 international film entries to the Oscars this year, and 51 of them are screening at the 2020 Palm Springs International Film Festival.
One receiving a lot of attention is South Korean film "Parasite." It follows a family living in a semi-basement apartment and struggling to make ends meet, who are gifted with a mysterious rock that is supposed to bring them wealth but takes a dark and gut-wrenching turn for the worst.
"Parasite" was the first Korean film in the history of the Cannes Film Festival to win its highest prize, the Palme d'Or, in 2019.
It also won the Foreign Language category at the Golden Globes and made the shortlist of foreign films for the Oscars. "Parasite" has appeared on countless year-end top 10 film lists, including Rolling Stone, The New York Times and TIME.
The film screens at the Palm Springs film festival at 6 p.m. on Jan. 8.
Festival programmers also pointed to a few other international films that they expect to do well with audiences.
Here's a short list of international films you won't want to miss.
'Dogs Don't Wear Pants' (Finland) The title of the film is deceptive. "Tom of Finand" actor Pekka Strang plays a widowed heart surgeon who takes his daughter to get her tongue pierced and has an encounter with a dominatrix.
Through exploring BDSM, he finds himself in dangerous situations facing his inner-demons.
In her Screen Daily review, Wendy Ide said Strang and co-star Krista Kosonen's performance is "an encounter which will change both lives, and a consensual but somewhat bruising relationship develops which may leave some audience members whimpering for a safe word."
Showtimes: 5:30 p.m., Jan. 10, Palm Canyon Theater; 1:45 p.m., Jan. 11, Regal Cinemas
'Lunana: A Yak In The Classroom' (Bhutan) The South Asian and Himalayan Kingdom of Bhutan is not known for films, but "Lunana: A Yak In The Classroom" gives audiences a chance to experience the country in this narrative about a government teacher named Ugyen (played by Sherab Dorji) who wants to leave everything behind for a chance to be a singer in Australia. He is sent to teach in a remote village with a lack of necessities, such as electricity and the comforts he's used to, but finds the children have something to teach him about happiness.
"There's a lot to like about this film: the scenery is fantastic, and the story itself is a sweet tale that mixes ambition, national pride, young love, and a love of music," wrote Michael Hayward of Geist.
Screenings: 4:30 p.m., Jan. 10, Regal Cinemas; 12:15, Jan. 11, Camelot Theatres; 10:30 a.m., Jan. 12, Mary Pickford is D'Place
'Papicha' (Algeria) Set during the Algerian Civil War in the '90s, "Papicha" tells the story of a young woman, who dreams of being a fashion designer, and her friend rebelling against Algeria's laws requiring women to be completely covered. In an act of protest, they stage a fashion show. The film was censored in Algeria right before the cutoff date in September to be considered for the Oscars.
Screenings: 2:30 p.m., Jan. 12, Regal Cinemas
Hearts and Bones (Australia) Hugo Weaving ("The Matrix" and "The Lord of the Rings") plays an Australian war photographer with post-traumatic stress disorder who returns home and meets a South Sudanese refugee. The refugee asks him not to feature any photos of the massacre in his village in an upcoming photo exhibition. While going through the photos, they make a startling discovery. Weaving is nominated for an Australian Academy of Cinema and Television Arts award for Best Actor for his performance.
Screenings: Jan. 9, Camelot Theatres. 7 p.m., Jan. 11, Palm Springs High School.
Workforce (Mexico) After a mason falls to his death on the job and his pregnant widow is denied compensation by his employer, this socioeconomic drama takes a utopian turn.
"It's the kind of measured, intelligent provocation which is tailor-made for the festival audience, and should go on to screen extensively at other events," wrote Ide.
Director David Zonana won Best Director at the Zurich Film Festival.
Screenings: 6 p.m., Jan. 9, Camelot Theatres.

7-Eleven strikes back at owner who took day off

Texto completo: HIGASHI-OSAKA, Japan - The rice balls are gone. So are the juice bottles, which Mitoshi Matsumoto priced to sell early. Most of his store's shelves stand empty, but he has kept some cigarette cartons and bottles of alcohol in the hope that his long-running battle with the 7-Eleven convenience store chain will end in his favor.
The company that controls the 7-Eleven chain, Seven & I Holdings Co., terminated Matsumoto's franchise last week after he decided to close his store for a day on New Year's Day, and it has stopped supplying him.
It was the latest battle between Matsumoto and one of Japan's most well-known companies over harsh working conditions in the Japanese convenience store industry, which demands that stores stay open seven days a week, 24 hours a day, for all 365 days a year.
Matsumoto remains in business, but just barely. The screen on the ATM flashes "not in operation." His two full-time employees are ready to jump to new jobs once he finally closes, and his seven part-time employees no longer show up.
Still, he plans to stay open as long as he can.
"I want to stay in business for the sake of myself and other owners throughout the country," said Matsumoto, 57, who says he plans to continue his fight in a local court.
A spokesman for Seven & I, Katsuhiko Shimizu, said the company terminated Matsumoto's contract on Dec. 31. He denied that the termination was tied to Matsumoto's plan to close for a day, and instead cited numerous customer complaints about the store and Matsumoto's disparaging remarks about the company on social media.
Matsumoto's fight with 7-Eleven has made him famous in Japan, a country that has long struggled with a strenuous and sometimes deadly work culture.
Those strains are evident in the convenience store industry.
Japan's convenience store chains have expanded dramatically in recent years in an effort to capture market share at one another's expense.
While the expenses were minimal for the chains, the expansion took a toll on the franchisees who operate the vast majority of Japan's more than 55,000 convenience stores. Unable to find dependable workers, many owners increasingly worked themselves.
"Under the current situation, the company can have it both ways," said Naoki Tsuchiya, a professor at Musashi University in Tokyo and an expert on labor issues in the convenience store industry, who called Matsumoto "a significant figure" in the nationwide discussion over the industry.
Despite his troubles with the company, Matsumoto said he hoped a legal fight would restore his franchise and allow him to open up. He said 7-Eleven offered to pay for his remaining inventory - owners are responsible for buying their own products from the company at wholesale prices - but he refused. He wants Japan's convenience store industry to change instead.
"If I win the case, I hope more will follow and raise their voices," he said. "If I lose, many will get depressed and more afraid of 7-Eleven."

Texto completo: Ernest J. Gaines' "A Lesson Before Dying" launches Broward County Library's Big Read 2020 with myriad book and culture programs. A critically acclaimed bestseller, "A Lesson Before Dying" is the story of a barely literate black man on trial in Louisiana for a murder he didn't commit and the teacher who helps him. Themes of social justice, racial inequality and personal redemption reverberate through the novel. The 1993 novel won the National Book Critics Circle Award for Fiction, was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize, featured in Oprah's Book Club and a New York Times bestseller. Gaines, who died in November 2019, also wrote "A Gathering of Old Men" and "The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman." Big Read events for "A Lesson Before Dying" include book and movie discussions for adults and children at each Broward County library, crafts, Cajun cooking workshops and a blues concert reflecting music from the novel's era. Many discussions also include American Sign Language. A complete schedule of events is at Broward.org/Library.
Copies of "A Lesson Before Dying" in several media are available from the Broward County Library, including books, downloadable ebooks, audiobooks and DVD. Big Read 2020 is a National Endowment for the Arts program.

Texto completo: Elizabeth Wurtzel, whose startling 1994 memoir, "Prozac Nation: Young and Depressed in America," won praise for opening a dialogue about clinical depression and helped introduce an unsparing style of confessional writing that remains influential, died Tuesday in New York City. She was 52.
Writer David Samuels, a friend since childhood, said the cause was metastatic breast cancer, a disease that resulted from the BRCA genetic mutation. Wurtzel had a double mastectomy in 2015. After her diagnosis, she became an advocate for BRCA testing - something she had not had - and wrote about her cancer experience in The New York Times.
"I could have had a mastectomy with reconstruction and skipped the part where I got cancer," she wrote. "I feel like the biggest idiot for not doing so."
Writing about her final illness was a natural choice for Wurtzel, who had for a quarter-century scrutinized her life in relentless detail, becoming a hero to some, especially to many women of her generation and younger, but also drawing scorn. "Prozac Nation," her first book, published when she was 27, was unvarnished in its accounts of her student days at Harvard University, her drug use, her extensive sex life and more.
It divided critics.
"Wurtzel's nation is a nation of one," Karen Schoemer wrote in a dismissive review in Newsweek. "She makes only tenuous attempts to draw parallels between herself and her generation, and she randomly blames her parents, her therapists, her friends, the divorce rate, drugs and the times for her problems."
But Michiko Kakutani, reviewing the book in The New York Times, found more to like. She acknowledged that its self-pitying passages "make the reader want to shake the author, and remind her that there are far worse fates than growing up during the '70s in New York and going to Harvard."
"But," she added, "Ms. Wurtzel herself is hyperaware of the narcissistic nature of her problems, and her willingness to expose herself - narcissism and all - ultimately wins the reader over."
The book became a cultural reference point and part of a new wave of confessional writing.
Wurtzel followed her own lead with her subsequent writing, especially "More, Now, Again: A Memoir of Addiction," published in 2002. That book detailed her abuse of cocaine and of Ritalin, which she would grind up and snort. As she put it in a 2013 essay for New York magazine, "I made a career out of my emotions."
Elizabeth Lee Wurtzel was born July 31, 1967, in Manhattan. Her mother, Lynne Ellen Winters, was married to Donald Wurtzel, and until recently Elizabeth Wurtzel had assumed that he was her father. In a 2018 essay in New York, she wrote of learning that she was actually the child of an affair between her mother and photographer Bob Adelman, who died in 2016.
She grew up on the Upper East Side and began writing "Prozac Nation" in 1986, while she was a student at Harvard.
"It was originally a book about Harvard; it wasn't even about depression," she told the news website Vice in 1994. "But everything in it was about being depressed, so that changed it."
While earning her bachelor's degree she wrote for The Harvard Crimson and started an internship at The Dallas Morning News, but she lost that job amid accusations of plagiarism. After graduating she was able to get jobs with New York magazine and The New Yorker, writing about rock music, often in a way that invited derision. When Tina Brown took over as editor of The New Yorker in 1992, Wurtzel was one of her first cuts.
In 2015, Wurtzel married James Freed Jr., who survives her, as does her mother.

Pelosi's drug-pricing plan robs patients of new medicines Guest columnist

Texto completo: The House of Representatives just passed Speaker Nancy Pelosi's unprecedented crackdown on the pharmaceutical industry. Her bill, HR 3, would allow the government to dictate prices on a broad array of drugs, with the promise of bringing domestic prices closer to those in foreign countries with government-run healthcare systems.
HR 3 is savvy politics. Nearly eight in 10 Americans say prescription drugs cost too much. But government price-setting is not the solution. Such policies stifle innovation and deprive patients of novel medicines.
The centerpiece of HR 3 is a requirement that up to 250 high-end drugs submit to government-run "negotiations" over their price. But these would be negotiations in name only. Drug firms would be required to charge prices indexed to those in Japan, Germany, and several other countries where the government effectively dictates drug prices.
Put differently, these "negotiations" would simply import foreign price caps.
Technically, drug makers could decline to participate. But if they did, they'd face a new tax of 65 percent of sales of the drug in question, with raises in subsequent years. If the bill becomes law, drug makers will lose a trillion dollars in revenue within just 10 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office.
Plummeting revenue would have severe consequences for drug research. Consider the impact on small biotech firms. About two in three new medicines originates at a small company. These firms rely on venture capital, but as more than a dozen venture capitalists explained in a recent letter to Congress, government price caps would make investing in small firms "too risky." At big drug firms, manufacturers plow roughly one of every five dollars in revenue back into research.
The Congressional Budget Office calculates that HR 3 will snuff out up to 15 new drugs over the next decade. But this is a gross underestimate, as it ignores the fact that it often takes more than a decade to bring a single new medicine to market.
I've witnessed firsthand how sudden drops in revenue can compromise drug innovation. Thirteen years ago, I ran global research at Pfizer. After pouring billions of dollars - and thousands of research hours - into what we'd hoped would be a breakthrough cholesterol drug, the product failed in clinical trials.
To stanch the bleeding on our balance sheet, we had to cut our research and development budget by 10 percent and close Michigan's largest biopharmaceutical research facility. More than 2,000 people lost their jobs.
Speaker Pelosi's plan would needlessly impose these kinds of losses across the drug industry.
Some supporters of the speaker's plan claim the National Institutes of Health can step in and fill any drop in private research funding. HR 3 even includes a provision that earmarks some of the expected public savings for the NIH to spend on drug development.
But this thinking is naïve. The average NIH grant to a university researcher is under a million dollars. Pharmaceutical firms, on the other hand, spend an average of about $2.6 billion to develop just one new drug. The NIH does not have nearly enough money to compensate for the evaporation of private investment in drug development.
The NIH also lacks the expertise to bring new medicines to patients. Most NIH researchers work on early-stage, basic research - not the late-stage discovery and testing required to bring a new medicine to market.
Some supporters of the Pelosi plan's champions have bitten the bullet and admitted it will devastate drug innovation. As one glowing New York Times editorial put it: "Americans will need to accept a trade-off."
"Trade-off." That's quite the euphemism for a public health disaster. The United States is currently the drug innovation capital of the world, home to over 4,500 potential new medicines in development across U.S. labs.
Three-quarters of those research lines are "first in class," meaning they represent genuine breakthroughs attacking disease in novel ways.
Proponents of HR 3 believe sacrificing a few new drugs is OK if it means lower prices. But that's not an option for the patients and families living with a disease for which there is no cure.
Policymakers should, of course, look for ways to make drugs more affordable for patients - but not in ways that will sacrifice future innovation.
The author is a senior partner at PureTech Health and the former president of Pfizer Global Research and Development.

Texto completo: On Christmas Day, Greta Gerwig's updated version of the young adult classic "Little Women" opened in theaters to great acclaim, fantastic reviews and strong box office numbers.
And yet, some women found fault with the fact that not enough men were flocking to see it.
In a piece for the New York Times, writer Kristy Eldredge observed that the film hadn't garnered a lot of award nominations from the Screen Actors Guild (zero) and the Golden Globes (two), and mentioned that the audiences seemed to be overwhelmingly filled with women. Film producer Amy Pascal agrees, arguing in Vanity Fair that many male awards-season voters are skipping Gerwig's adaptation because they think it's not for guys.
Eldredge seemed to blame men for not appreciating female-centric stories and framed it as some sort of character flaw that society needed to address: "If many men haven't wanted to give it a chance because they don't think it's meant for them, we still have a way to go in considering all kinds of narratives about women to be deserving of thoughtful attention."
It's not surprising that a story about the relationship between four Civil War-era sisters written over 150 years ago and with absolutely no battlefield scenes is not a favorite with the Xbox set. While there has always been some cross-gender interest in young adult literature like "A Separate Peace" and "Catcher in the Rye" which have strong male characters, there is a universality of message in those books. In other words, Holden Caulfield's existential angst and the rough contours of Gene and Phinny's tragic friendship have resonance beyond their masculinity.
But "Little Women" is really just a movie about females, and their dreams and aspirations and disappointments, and that's perfectly OK. In fact, it's sublime. The book and the movies adapted from it are some of the most touching examples of female bonding in literary and cinematic history. As a Bryn Mawr graduate – like Katharine Hepburn – I am partial to the 1933 film, but Gerwig's adaptation is exceptional and deserving of all the accolades it will earn.
But it is a bit ridiculous for women to be complaining that men are not interested in a book and movie called, for lord's sake, "Little WOMEN". This preoccupation with "gender parity" has become cult-like.
I know a bunch of boys around the age of 11 or 12 who love dinosaurs and Jedis. They also love Harry Potter, The Lord of the Rings, R.L. Stine, and any number of things that girls the same age also enjoy.
I don't share the angst over a presumed lack of interest on the part of men about the destinies of Meg, Jo, Amy and Beth March.
Ironically, Louisa May Alcott herself wasn't thrilled with the idea of writing what she called a "girls' story." She wrote in her diary: "I plod away, though I don't enjoy this sort of thing. Never liked girls or knew many, except my sisters; but our queer plays and experiences may prove interesting, though I doubt it."
If even the writer of this wonderful story doesn't expect boys to like it, why in the world should we?

Texto completo: A Freeport woman plans to file a $1 million civil rights lawsuit against Nassau County and Freeport officials, claiming a deputy sheriff punched her in the face during a verbal altercation partially captured on video from her doorbell camera.
Felita Dobbins, 46, of Lena Avenue, has filed a notice of claim against the county, the Nassau sheriff's department, Freeport Village and individual police officers and sheriff's deputies. In it, she alleges that when she tried to report the alleged assault to police, they attempted to cover it up. 
Dobbins, in a sometimes tearful interview Tuesday at the Hauppauge office of her attorney Kenneth M. Mollins, said she was home with her children and grandchildren Dec. 30 about 8 p.m. when two sheriff's deputies came to her door - apparently to serve legal papers on her daughter connected to a paternity suit.
Dobbins said she answered the door and one of the deputies threatened to arrest her. She said she began screaming at him, swearing and calling him names. "I said some nasty words I shouldn't have said; My emotions got over me because of certain things I've been through in life," said Dobbins, referring to past interactions with law enforcement and her sexual assault in prison. 
Video footage from Dobbins' Ring doorbell camera shows the deputy dropping papers in the home and leaving, but as Dobbins continues to shout, the pair returns a few seconds later.
"He ran back and hit me with the cuffs and tried to hold the door with his other hand," said Dobbins, who said she went to the hospital for treatment.
The video, which only shows the outside of the home, does not show the deputy's hand coming into contact with Dobbins, who was standing inside her home at the door when she said she was struck.
"Clearly, you see him come up to the door, you see him throw the papers, you see him step towards her on the video, and you see his fist go back. Then Ring only shows you what's in front of the doorbell. The contact occurred in the house behind the doorbell," Mollins said. "So he assaulted her in her own home."
Mollins said the deputy should be charged and he contacted the Nassau County district attorney's office Monday. "We learned of these allegations yesterday and will review them," said Miriam Sholder, a spokeswoman for the district attorney's office. 
Captain Michael R. Golio, a sheriff's department spokesman, said in an email: "This matter is under investigation. Nassau County does not comment on anticipated or pending litigation." Freeport Village also denied the allegations.
Dobbins, who has a criminal record, served several years in prison in upstate Bedford Hills in the 1990s in connection with a Manhattan robbery. She was sexually assaulted by a guard while there, a case that became part of a successful fight to expand state law to make it a crime for a prison guard to have sex with an inmate, according to a 1996 New York Times article.
Dobbins said Tuesday that Freeport police attempted to prevent her from filing a police report about the alleged assault at her home, but she ultimately did. 
"We believe the Freeport police are looking to protect this deputy sheriff, who clearly, based on the video, acted improperly, acted illegally, and assaulted my client," Mollins said.
Freeport Village Attorney Howard Colton said: "While it is policy to not comment on pending litigation, we believe this action is absolutely frivolous and will be vehemently defended by the Villag

Ghosn and Japan Inc. Can Make Up

Texto completo: There are two reasons to become a fugitive: because you're afraid you'll get justice or afraid you won't. This column first used these words not in relation to Carlos Ghosn but in relation to Jacob "Kobi" Alexander, the tech CEO who fled to Namibia in 2006 rather than face prosecution in the stock-option backdating scandals.
The interesting case, of course, is not the completely innocent person, but one who may be guilty of something but fears being strung up out of all proportion to an alleged wrong. When all was said and done, a prominent lawyer later explained to the New York Times, the backdating "prosecutions went out with a whimper rather than a bang," not least because judges and juries came to see how a hysterical press had exaggerated the nature of the offense involved.
From his haven in Namibia, Mr. Alexander eventually faced justice voluntarily, serving time and likely judging his flight to have been a bad decision all things considered.
Which brings us to Mr. Ghosn. He who flees to put himself under a friendlier country's laws is not in precisely the same position as one who dons a false mustache and goes underground. In the case of a politically hot fugitive, another consideration may also come into play: His escape is not entirely unwelcome. As a source "close to Nissan" told the Journal, "We wanted it to stop. In Japan, New Year's is about driving evil spirits out of the house. In that way [Mr. Ghosn's departure] is the perfect story for New Year's."
In 1999, as a top officer at Renault, Mr. Ghosn arranged the alliance that saved Nissan from bankruptcy, using "ruthless competence" as a Japanese newspaper put it. In later years, he was in charge of setting his own pay, which he kept in line with what GM and Ford chief executives were earning. Then came the 2008 financial crisis, and Japan enacted a new disclosure rule along with ill-advised caps on what board members could be paid. Because he feared political blowback in Japan or in France (accounts vary), Mr. Ghosn chose to begin deferring about half his paycheck until after he retired.
These arrangements were apparently memorialized in writing but not guaranteed. A future CEO would still have to sign off on each payment. Mr. Ghosn reportedly told prosecutors that he was advised this meant the commitments did not have to be disclosed under Japanese law.
The amounts involved here add up to less than 0.01% of Nissan's annual revenue. Mr. Ghosn's total pay was approximately half what Sean Hannity is reported to make for his TV show.
Mr. Ghosn is a rich man, worth an estimated $120 million before his troubles began, but not stock-option rich or private-equity rich in the American sense -- though he certainly would have been bombarded with job offers to become so.
While he may not be wholly innocent of record-keeping and disclosure violations that in other countries would be regulatory issues, a big factor in Mr. Ghosn's arrest was a new Japanese plea-bargaining scheme introduced just months earlier. Under its terms, two Nissan executives were reportedly directed by the company to plead guilty to crimes that Mr. Ghosn could then be implicated in. All this came as Mr. Ghosn was seeking to make permanent the Renault-Nissan alliance by formally merging the two companies, under a deal that necessarily would have left Renault's shareholders, as the original rescuers, in a superior position.
Mr. Ghosn may have been high-handed; he may have tended to treat Nissan's resources as his own. But he likely was a lot less guilty than the Japanese legal system was getting ready to make him simply to ensure that Nissan remained a Japanese-controlled company.
His Japanese lawyer has admitted advising his client that he could not expect a fair trial in Japan but might still win. With a few more paragraphs to work with, I might even weave in a Jeffrey Epstein parallel. After all, the parties in Japan Inc. who are happy now to avoid a Carlos Ghosn trial are undoubtedly numerous, including Nissan's new leadership, which has been running the company into the ground while struggling with legal problems of its own.
In choosing to flee, Mr. Ghosn enjoyed an option unavailable to others caught up in Japan's nobody-is-innocent, everybody-confesses trial system. Perversely, Japan's new plea-bargain scheme, introduced in June 2018, likely only worsens a predilection for false confessions. The subjects under whose noses these plea deals are dangled can be interrogated under onerous conditions without defense counsel present. They hardly need to be reminded that fewer than 1% of defendants are acquitted at trial.
Reforms are plainly needed. Mr. Ghosn is expected to address the media on Wednesday from his bolt-hole in Beirut. Various outcomes have been bruited. A good one would be a proper (U.S. style) plea bargain in which both sides lose a little face and recognize that there's plenty of disgrace to go around.

Boeing Does U-Turn on MAX Steps --- Plane maker now recommends extra simulator training for grounded aircraft

Texto completo: Boeing Co. recommended extra flight-simulator training for 737 MAX pilots, a humbling and costly reversal of a longstanding design principle that helped the aircraft maker minimize the time and expense for airlines to start flying the jets.
Boeing had steadfastly argued, even after two 737 MAX crashes, that pilot training on personal computers or laptops alone was sufficient. On Tuesday, the company disclosed its new position -- one that in the process jettisons a decades-old safety assumption that pilots typically respond to emergencies in mere seconds.
The move is the latest sign that new leadership at Boeing is seeking a more conciliatory approach toward national regulators, many of whom had bristled at the company's effort to flag when the plane would be cleared to fly. Last month, Boeing named David Calhoun to be its new chief executive.
At the same time, the training recommendation could complicate preparations by airlines to return the grounded aircraft to service once regulators give the go-ahead. Though the move was gaining support within the Federal Aviation Administration, some of Boeing's most loyal customers were upset at the abrupt announcement and lack of consultation by the plane maker, according to government and industry officials.
One of Boeing's main selling points for the MAX when the aircraft was first offered in 2011 was saving airlines the expense and time of subjecting flight crews to extra simulator sessions. New requirements could make it more difficult for carriers to seamlessly substitute pilots and planes when needed. The final cost hinges on the type and length of the training mandated by regulators.
As part of Boeing's initial marketing campaign, the plane maker promised to refund Southwest Airlines Co. $1 million for each MAX purchased if the jets ended up requiring extra simulator time for crews, according to congressional investigators and industry officials familiar with the specifics.
Southwest, the largest MAX operator with 34 of the jets in its fleet at the time of the grounding in March, said it is awaiting final direction from regulators, but has been modeling scenarios for both simulator and computer-based training requirements.
Boeing's shift in position threatens to further delay the return of the MAX to passenger service. Southwest and American Airlines are currently aiming to fly the MAX again in April, while United Airlines isn't planning to fly the plane again until June.
"It certainly doesn't bode well for a near-term return to service," Greg Bowen, chairman of the training and standards committee at the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association.
Airlines and leasing companies already were saying it could take 18 months or more to put into service the entire global fleet of about 800 jets, including 420 undelivered aircraft. Boeing is halting MAX production this month to prevent the backlog growing.
Carriers are seeking details about whether the training sessions will have to take place in a simulator designed specifically for the MAX. There are about 35 such simulators available. Among U.S. airlines, Southwest has three, American Airlines Group Inc. has one, and United Airlines Holdings Inc. has one, though United's doesn't have full motion capability. Additional simulators are on the way this year.
Boeing's move also reflects how dramatically the 737 MAX crisis, stemming from crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia that cost 346 lives, has altered some longstanding standards for aircraft design, training and regulation.
For decades, Boeing and the FAA have maintained that the typical pilot would need no more than four seconds to react to most cockpit emergencies. Now, they consider 10 or 15 seconds as a more likely period of time needed by pilots to react to a range of cockpit emergencies, according to industry and government experts participating in the deliberations.
The reassessment, which has been under way with regulators for months, means that engineers, aviation authorities and carriers no longer will be able to rely as heavily as they did on pilots to serve as ultimate backstops when onboard systems malfunction or automated flight-control features go haywire.
Boeing had previously said it expected some airlines to opt for simulator training, but viewed computer-based education as providing all necessary information for pilots on software fixes to the MAX's flight-control computer.
Greg Smith, Boeing's interim chief executive, said in a statement Tuesday that combining simulator sessions and computer-based training would help build confidence among the flying public, airlines and other stakeholders. Boeing's recommendation to back simulator training was earlier reported by the New York Times.
An FAA spokesman said the agency will consider Boeing's position as a cadre of international airline pilots reviews training issues in coming weeks, adding that data from those tests will be used to draft a report that eventually will be available for public comment.
"The agency will not approve the aircraft for return to service until all parts of the certification process are completed to its satisfaction," the FAA said.

AN IMPULSIVE, DIVERSIONARY TACTIC?

Texto completo: It was reported that President Donald Trump was given a number of possible actions to take against Iran and Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani and that, in the end, he shocked advisers by selecting the most extreme option - assassination.
At first, the justification given to the American people was that Gen. Soleimani had an American contractor killed. Yet strangely, there was no retaliation when Otto Warmbier was tortured by North Korea and later died, or when the Saudis killed Jamal Khashoggi.
Later, the explanation changed - Gen. Soleimani was assassinated because there was a dire, imminent threat. The president asked us to trust the U.S. Intelligence Agencies which are "the best in the world" (the same ones he previously called "corrupt" and part of a "deep state").
On Sunday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo walked the "imminent" part back when he said on CNN, "If you're an American in the region, days and weeks, this is not something that is relevant." So what was the impetus for this consequential assassination? What are we to believe?
The larger question is - how can a self-serving, frequent liar ever be believed? How can an administration that proudly admits to "alternative facts" be seen as trustworthy? And the fact that the president tweeted to announce the assassination to the nation (in between golfing) does not inspire confidence that this dangerous decision was given serious consideration
In all, this appears to have been an impulsive decision, that's why the story kept changing. As a longtime terrorist, Gen. Soleimani probably deserved his fate. But why did it happen now and in this way? Was it an impulsive, diversionary tactic by the president to take our minds off his impeachment? That is, did he seize on this opportunity to benefit himself? How many innocent people will be killed as a result?

Texto completo: There is only one interpretation of President Donald Trump's ordered killing last week of Iran's senior military commander, Maj. Gen. Qassem Soleimani: Mr. Trump wants to take America to war with Iran.
One cannot assassinate the head of another country's military without expecting that country to respond with corresponding acts.
Why does Mr. Trump want such a war? Primarily, he wants to emulate the experience of former President George W. Bush, who ordered the invasion of Iraq in 2003 under false pretenses in order to make himself a "war president" who could only be replaced in the 2004 elections at the country's hazard, in effect changing horses in the middle of a stream. Mr. Bush got his second term and, 17 years later, the U.S. is still heavily involved in Iraq.
Mr. Trump's second reason for wanting a war with Iran is more immediate. Washington and the media are - or were - busily circling around Mr. Trump's impeachment. What better way to draw the buzzards to a fresher kill than a war with Iran?
A third, more secondary reason for Mr. Trump's apparent desire for a war with Iran is that both Israel and Saudi Arabia would like one. Israel's three principal enemies in the Middle East used to be Iraq, Syria and Iran. The U.S. took out Iraq definitively in 2003. Syria has self-destructed with its own civil war, which continues. That leaves Iran. Soleimani was the commander of Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards Force, also known as the Quds Force. "Quds" is Arabic for Jerusalem.
Saudi Arabia's quarrel with Iran is steeped in differing interpretations of Islam. The Saudis and the United Arab Emirates, their frequent partner in Gulf adventures, are Sunni Muslim. Iran is Shiite. The most vigorous battle waged by the Saudis and the UAE, until now, has been in Yemen, torn to pieces (in humanitarian terms) by the war. The U.S. has armed and aided the Saudis in that conflict, to our shame.
But how do we get to U.S. responsibility for a war with Iran, if there is one? The U.S. currently has at least 5,000 troops in Iraq and perhaps even more contractors. (One could ask why.) A shell allegedly fired by Popular Mobilization Forces, an Iranian-backed Iraqi militia, killed an American contractor in an Iraqi camp. The U.S. responded by bombing several PMF camps, killing 75. Iraqi mobs in Baghdad then attacked the American Embassy, setting a fire before being repelled by American and Iraqi government forces.
Shortly thereafter, Soleimani and a deputy commander of the PMF were killed by a U.S. drone strike at the Baghdad airport, setting off the current kerfuffle. The chants of crowds across Iran and Iraq, as well as militant pronouncements in Tehran and Baghdad, have suggested a likely violent response by Iran, and possibly Iraq. Iraq is cross because the killing took place on its soil.
So far, Iran has said that it is no longer bound by its agreement with China, France, Germany, Russia and the United Kingdom - Mr. Trump had the U.S. drop out of the deal in 2018 - to halt its nuclear weapons program in return for the removal of economic sanctions. Iraq's parliament has voted for the removal of any U.S. forces currently stationed in its country.
Worse is likely to come for the United States. Its forces, bases and diplomatic and consular installations are sprawled across the world. The U.S. is as vulnerable as a climber on a rock face.
And that's just abroad. Never mind any vulnerabilities in the great heartland. Mr. Trump has said the U.S. will bomb up to 52 Iranian sites, including cultural targets (read, mosques and monuments) if Iran does something to American facilities or personnel somewhere.
All of this for Mr. Trump's electoral campaign. A war with Iran would put Mr. Trump's eventual Democratic opponent up against the wall. Would he or she support the war? Or would the Democrat opponent oppose it, raising the specter of disloyalty or treason, as well as non-support of our brave warriors, in spite of the needlessness of the war?
By the way, the difficulty of a war with Iran should not be underestimated. The road to Tehran would not be like the road to Baghdad. Iran is big, with a population of 80 million. It fought and took big casualties in its war against Iraq in the 1980s. It has allies that can light serious brushfires in other countries. (One example of this occurred during the weekend when a sometime Iranian ally, al-Shabab in Somalia, attacked a U.S.-Kenyan military base in northern Kenya.)
Are Americans ready for another war in the Middle East? I doubt it, given that we are already engaged in expensive wars in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Yemen and Ukraine. And it's not as if there aren't pressing problems at home, featured in the presidential campaign, that call for attention, instead of one more Middle Eastern enterprise for the Department of Defense.

AUSTRALIA ABLAZE THE AUSTRALIAN PM TOOK A VACATION AS HIS COUNTRY BURNS

Texto completo: Large tracts of the Australian continent are ablaze. Beyond the toll in lives and property, the most remarkable thing about this bushfire season is that people can see it, taste it and feel it.
While fires have long been a product of the country's hot, dry climate, they remained a remote idea for most Australians - something you caught for a few minutes on the evening news. Now more than 20 people have died and scores are missing. Areas larger than Denmark have been razed. As recently as last week, temperature warnings for parts of Sydney climbed to 45 degrees Celsius (113 degrees Farenheit). When haze blanketed the city in early December, our Bloomberg Opinion colleague David Fickling wrote of sleepless nights and bronchial coughs, amazed at the apathy of the political class.
Politicians are feeling pressure now. While visiting fire victims this week in Cobargo, just inland from the coast, conservative Prime Minister Scott Morrison faced an irate crowd. Some refused to shake his hand; others called for more resources to fight the flames. This angry reception came after he enjoyed an ill-timed vacation to Hawaii shortly before Christmas.
It's always risky to travel far from home during a crisis, but this jaunt was especially ham-handed: Mr. Morrison's office initially denied he was away, all while photos of him wearing board shorts and throwing up a surfer sign circulated on social media. A contrite Morrison was forced to return early.
This tabloid-worthy distraction now risks crowding out serious policy discussion. The opposition Labor Party, worried about losing the support of mining unions, wishes climate change would just go away, having blamed defeat in May's national election on being too pro-environment. Mr. Morrison, who staked his candidacy on support for the coal industry, has played down the impact of climate change on the fires, recently asking Australians to "be patient." His administration has been in emergency-response mode; but the crisis will be wasted if Australia's political class can't force a deeper reckoning about how to address climate change.
Voters should make this decision easy. Contrary to its "Crocodile Dundee" image abroad, Australia is one of the most urbanized societies on earth. The majority of its 25 million people live close to the coastline in the southeastern corner of the land mass. Much of the action the past week has been in that region, on the coast of New South Wales. This area is frequented by vacationers from Canberra, the federal capital and where one of your columnists grew up. Childhood vacation spots, like Batemans Bay, Malua Bay, Surf Beach, Mollymook and Ulladulla have been singed, or are close to it.
One longtime friend described a scene as resembling Dunkirk, with evacuees waiting on beaches for help, sometimes from the decks of their boats. Another said his brothers returned home to find the back fence had burned to the ground, the house possibly seconds from engulfing flames. Photos taken driving north toward Sydney, fleeing the inferno, resemble the surface of the moon.
Fires aren't usually this early in summer or this close to the coast. They tend to be further inland and later, around February and March, when the scrub has been baking for months. But with record-breaking temperatures, things can get dangerous very quickly.
One of your columnists recalls devastating fires in the rural northern outskirts of Melbourne nearly two generations ago. The view from his classroom window was of the Australian bush. Lush and green in winter, dry and brown in summer.
Then Ash Wednesday came. Late in the summer of 1983, after the school year had already commenced and while the bush remained dried out, the skies started turning dark. Parents were summoned to pick up their kids. Everyone knew the dangers. Local scrub fires seemed like an annual event, usually under control the same day and rarely causing much harm.
Just a few kilometers from the fire front, the flames couldn't easily be seen. The thickness of the smoke signaled that this time was different, though - black like a thunder cloud but more silent, more deadly. More than 70 people died.
For more and more Australians, this won't be a once-in-a-generation event. What a pity if the only lesson is that politicians cross Hawaii from their vacation lists.

Wine, under siege?

Texto completo: I like to drink wine. I'm still waiting for my personal benefactor to materialize, so in the meantime I seek out value. I'm a sucker for cru Beaujolais and Chablis, but I'll try whatever the staff at a trusted shop recommends. Most of the time, the bottles I buy come from France, Italy, or elsewhere in the European Union.
My drinking habits may be about to change. Yours too. And that is the least of the wine industry's worries. A proposed 100 percent tariff on European wine is threatening to upend the entire industry, putting many businesses at risk.
The cause is an unlikely one: a longstanding dispute between the United States and Europe over EU subsidies to airplane manufacturer Airbus. In October, the World Trade Organization determined the subsidies were illegal and authorized the US to impose tariffs on $7.5 billion in European goods. The Trump administration then levied a 10 percent tax on aircraft — and a 25 percent tax on a long list of products including Parmesan cheese, single-malt Scotch, olive oil, and many wines from France, Spain, Germany, and the UK. (Of course, the WTO has also ruled that US subsidies to Boeing are illegal, so soon-to-also-be-heavily-taxed pot calling kettle.)
The 25 percent tariff may just be a step toward what's to come. The potential 100 percent tax aims wider, encompassing all EU wines and a broader range of additional products. It would also be devastating for cheese shops and many other specialty grocers.
For the most part, wine consumers haven't yet felt the sting of the 25 percent. We are still buying our way through warehoused pre-tariff bottles. And in the US wine is distributed via a three-tier system of producers (growers and wineries), wholesalers (importers and distributors), and retailers (stores, restaurants, and bars) put into place post-Prohibition. At each tier, there's a markup. That means wine gets progressively more expensive as it moves along the chain, but in this case it also means the pain can be spread out among more parties. If each tier can get by with slimmer margins for a time, the end price doesn't look all that different.
But a 25 percent tariff is merely severe. A 100 percent tariff would be extreme. As the Jan. 13 deadline for public comment to the Office of the United States Trade Representative fast approaches, the wine world waits, operating in a state of uncertainty. Petitions and exhortations for comment are flooding social media. The New York Times ran an opinion piece Jan. 5 by Jenny Lefcourt, president and cofounder of natural wine importers Jenny & Francois Selections, with the headline “The Insanity of Trump's Wine Tariffs." It began: “I have spent 20 years building a wine-import company. On Jan. 14, the Trump administration could destroy it all by imposing a 100 percent tariff on European wine." Inside players are trying to plan, strategize, and position themselves for what may or may not be to come. One importer and distributor recently sent a memo to clients, reminding them of its sizable inventory and promising to keep pricing stable. The company planned to order as much wine as possible in advance of the potential tariff — as much as six months' worth.
Oscar Hernandez, owner of Olmstead Wine Company, a distributor of natural and organic wines, is not just concerned for his own small business but for everyone it is connected to. The wine industry runs on relationships. “There's a whole network of trucking companies, dockworkers, warehouse workers. There are so many jobs," he says. “The wineries, my importers, customers here — across the board, from start to finish, all of those are small businesses. It's like throwing a bomb into this long network of hard-working, honest businesses, people trying to make a living off something they care about while trying to support each other and the people we sell to. It's a tight-knit circle but one that expands further than a lot of people realize."
Michael Dupuy, who owns Streetcar Wine & Beer in Jamaica Plain, started an online petition to oppose the tariff. He was initially hoping to get maybe 500 signatures, he says. It currently has more than 3,000. “We have to plan for the worst without knowing fully what's going to happen yet," Dupuy says. “The immediate impact will be on the importers. Upon the effective imposition of the tariff, whatever comes in after will receive a bill from the US government for 100 percent of the value. It's a huge cash-flow issue for anyone, let alone a small importer with small margins." The costs would then get passed on to distributors, restaurants, and consumers. “I'd expect some of those wines to go up 50 to 150 percent," he says. So much for good value.
Consumers might turn to wines from non-European regions, but there simply aren't enough of them to go around. More than 75 percent of the world's production comes from EU countries, Dupuy says. Regardless, domestic and European bottles aren't interchangeable, and one of the great pleasures of wine is the sense of place it conveys. At a French restaurant, an Oregon pinot noir isn't the same as a Burgundy.
The United States is far from the only market for European wines. If the US becomes a less-viable market, many producers will take their wines somewhere else. Asia is one likely destination, with many industry watchers looking to China. Natalie Wang is the creator of Vino Joy News, which tracks the Chinese wine market. She's not so sure. “I would caution producers and wineries to manage their expectations on China," she writes in an e-mail. “In the past year, [the] wine market has been extremely challenging in China. Consumption is slowing down and big players are overloaded with stocks. Many are fearing that the slump in 2019 is going to continue into 2020." On the other hand, she says, Japan has potential. It signed an Economic Partnership Agreement with the EU last year, reducing tariffs on European wines.
Regardless of where they go, once these wines leave the country, they aren't likely to come back. “It would mean, certainly, the end of Burgundy in the US," says master sommelier Brahm Callahan, corporate beverage director for the Himmel Hospitality Group, which includes Grill 23, Harvest, and other restaurants. “We are already talking about a very expensive product, and it's only going to get exponentially more expensive." For instance, let's say a restaurant that buys a $100 bottle sells it at a markup of 200-300 percent. A bottle that would appear on a wine list now for $200-$300 might be double that on a post-tariff wine list. “A wine that was $300 last year might be $600 this year," Callahan says. “I don't think consumers are going to pay that."
Haley Fortier, owner of wine bars haley.henry and nathálie, is optimistic about the industry's ability to weather the potential tariff. The relationships at the heart of the wine business will help save it, she believes. There are plenty of importers who have spent their careers boosting small winemakers. “All those people, a lot of those winemakers have the same heart and respect for them. It's not a decision they're making. The administration is making it. They will have compassion for the people who have championed them all along," she says. “There are always obstacles in every business. This just happens to be a major one. Hopefully the relationships that have bonded will be stronger than this particular challenge."
Or hopefully the tariff will simply be scuttled due to a wave of opposition and evidence that it would hurt the US more than the EU, which would at any rate retaliate by imposing tariffs of its own. Should the 100 percent tax go into effect, one bright spot would be the chance to discover new domestic wines. Oregon and California are areas to look to, of course, but the Finger Lakes in New York and Texas Hill Country are also producing interesting bottles.
And then there's Charlottesville, Va., where a winery nestled in the mountains stands to profit from increased attention to domestic wines. I called to see what folks there thought of the proposed tariff, but no one at Trump Winery returned my call.

Texto completo: As emergency medical technicians took my father to an ambulance, my mother, concerned about the temperature's wintry bite, draped his favorite leather jacket over him for warmth.
“Oh, don't worry about the cold," a female EMT told her. “He won't feel it."
What I didn't know then was how common it is for those who pledge to “first, do no harm" to discount black people's capacity for pain.
This grievous act of racist malpractice is well documented, most recently regarding the opioid crisis. According to “Trends in Black and White Opioid Mortality in the United States, 1979–2015," published in Epidemiology, black patients were prescribed painkillers at a lower rate than their white counterparts. Analyzing the data, The New York Times concluded that had the numbers been equal, more than 14,000 black people would have died during that period from prescription opioid- related causes.
To be clear, doctors weren't safeguarding black patients from the highly addictive drugs, Researchers say physicians' motives were often driven by racial stereotyping, not medical magnanimity. Some worried that black people would sell their medication, or had a greater susceptibility to addiction.
But mostly, they believed these black lives mattered less. Patients were forced to self-medicate, sometimes with illegal drugs, because pain does not discriminate. They missed work, pushing them toward financial ruin. They died in pain that their doctors refused to recognize or else under-treated.
Now with deaths of black people from opioids skyrocketing, the medical community has found yet another discriminating twist: black people addicted to opioids are less likely to receive drugs that alleviate cravings and decrease fatal overdoses.
This has deepened the canyon-wide and centuries-old distrust many African-Americans have toward the medical community.
Those suspicions have roots in white medical and scientific malfeasance. In the 19th century, Louis Agassiz, a Harvard professor, promoted junk science claiming different races were separate, unequal species. The goal, of course, was to render African-Americans as less than human. It was an Ivy League justification of white supremacy as the natural order.
In the infamous decades-long “Tuskegee experiment," hundreds of poor black men, told they were receiving free medical care, went untreated for syphilis so doctors could track the disease's progression. Even after penicillin was introduced as a treatment, these men were given only aspirin or placebos. Some died, others went blind or suffered severe mental disabilities as the disease affected their brains.
For decades in New York's Central Park, a statue honored Dr. J. Marion Sims, often called the “father of modern gynecology." Many of the experiments that led to his groundbreaking work were conducted — without anesthesia — on enslaved black women, who had no agency over their bodies. As the debate about the removal of Confederate statues roiled in 2018, Mayor Bill de Blasio finally ordered that Sims's statue be relocated to the Brooklyn cemetery where he is buried.
Anyone convinced such medical horror stories are consigned to the past ignores its echoes today — from the under-prescribing of painkillers to the high rates of pregnancy-related mortality among black women.
No one disputes the tragic effect that the massive over-distribution of prescription opioids has had on this nation. The number of deaths may be shrinking, but tens of thousands still perish every year. Yet there's also no denying that too many black people were forced to suffer by doctors more attuned to their own biases than their patients' pain.
When I finally arrived home on that bitter February morning, my mother, wearing my father's leather jacket and suddenly a widow, tearfully shared her story about the EMT. Nearly 20 years later, I still wonder if the callousness of that woman's comment foreshadowed how my father would be treated in his time of dying. Did he receive unequal care? If he was in pain, did the attending physician do anything to comfort him? Would my father have lived if he were a white man?

Prime has a new CEO
Prime Automotive Group has named a new chief executive, Todd Skelton, to run the Westwood-based chain of dealerships. Skelton most recently was president of the Northeast market for AutoNation. Skelton left AutoNation last year, and recently moved from the Baltimore area to Massachusetts. Interim chief executive Kevin Westfall has returned to the chairman's role at Prime, which is controlled by GPB Capital of New York. (Westfall is also a former AutoNation executive.) Former CEO David Rosenberg was pushed aside last year after he sued GPB in Norfolk Superior Court, accusing the investment firm of financial misconduct. Rosenberg claims he was wrongfully terminated, while GPB denies his allegations. — JON CHESTO

WGBH to open a bureau in Worcester
WGBH is heading to Worcester. The Boston-based public broadcaster unveiled plans to open a one-person satellite bureau in the city, at 27 Federal St., coincidentally the former home of the Worcester Telegram & Gazette. The 1,000-square-foot bureau will house a fully equipped broadcast studio when it opens this spring. The bureau will focus on producing news stories for 89.7 FM (WGBH's radio station) and for WGBH's website. The Worcester bureau is being funded in part by two family foundations. — JON CHESTO
ELECTRIC VEHICLES
Tesla's Shanghai factory delivers its first cars to customers
Tesla's Shanghai factory delivered its first cars to customers Monday and chief executive Elon Musk said the electric automaker plans to set up a design center in China to create a model for worldwide sales. Musk presided at a ceremony where a half-dozen buyers wearing red Tesla T shirts drove away new Model 3 sedans. He expressed thanks to earlier customers who he said made Tesla's expansion in China possible by purchasing imported models from the fledgling brand. Tesla Inc. built the Gigafactory 3, its first outside the United States, following the Communist Party's 2018 decision to allow full foreign ownership in electric car manufacturing. It is due to produce the Model 3 and a planned SUV, the Model Y. — ASSOCIATED PRESS
RIDE HAILING
Uber offering pin codes for passenger safety
Uber is offering riders a four-digit pin code to help ensure they're getting into the right car. The ride-hailing company rolled out the new feature across the United States and Canada Tuesday and said all riders in those two countries will be able to use pin codes by the end of the week. The development follows the death of 21-year-old Samantha “Sami" Josephson, who was murdered in March after getting into the car of a man impersonating an Uber driver. Her body was later found in the woods 65 miles away. Since then, states have been pushing for additional safety requirements for Uber drivers. In New Jersey, where Josephson grew up, the state passed a law requiring ride-hailing drivers to display identification signs on the car's front windshield and rear window. North Carolina passed a law requiring Uber and Lyft drivers to display lighted signs. — ASSOCIATED PRESS
TECHNOLOGY
Sonos sues Google over speaker technology
Sonos alleged in two federal lawsuits Tuesday that Google swiped its speaker technology to create its own, seeking a halt on further sales of speakers and other devices that contain the hardware as well as financial penalties. In the suits, filed with the US District Court in Los Angeles and the US International Trade Commission, Sonos claims Google co-opted patented technology that allows for its speakers to work in multiple rooms and put it to use in its own speakers including the Google Home and Pixel devices and the discontinued Chromecast Audio. Google gained access to Sonos' technology through a partnership begun in 2013 allowing Sonos' speakers to work with Google Play Music, according to the suits. "Google has not merely copied Sonos's patented technology, it has also subsidized the prices of its patent infringing products, including at the entry level, and flooded the market," according to one of the suits. "These actions have caused significant damage to Sonos." Google denied the allegations and said it would "vigorously" defend itself in court. "Over the years, we have had numerous ongoing conversations with Sonos about both companies' IP rights and we are disappointed that Sonos brought these lawsuits instead of continuing negotiations in good faith," said a spokesman, Jose Castaneda. The lawsuits were reported earlier by The New York Times. — WASHINGTON POST
INTERNATIONAL
Finnish leader denies study of four-day workweek
As Finland's prime minister, Sanna Marin, scanned international news headlines this week, she may have been surprised to learn that she was being credited for looking into the feasibility of a four-day workweek. On Tuesday, Marin's government put an end to the myth. The idea of drastically shorter working hours was briefly touched on by Marin in August, months before she was made Finnish prime minister in December. But the government now wants to make clear that a four-day week isn't on the agenda and "there hasn't been any recent activity" on the topic, according to a Twitter update on Tuesday. — BLOOMBERG NEWS

India's economy likely to face slowest growth since 2013
India's economy is on track for its slowest growth since at least 2013, weighed down by a shadow banking crisis, weak investment, and a slump in spending. Gross domestic product will grow 5 percent in the year through March 2020, the Statistics Ministry said in a statement in New Delhi on Tuesday. That is in line with the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of 22 economists and compares with 6.8 percent expansion in the previous year. That pace will place India, which was the world's fastest-growing major economy last year, behind regional peers like China, Vietnam, and the Philippines, all of which are seen expanding close to 6 percent or more. — BLOOMBERG NEWS
FOOD
Move over Impossible Burger, Impossible Sausage is coming
After a big year for its plant-based burger, Impossible Foods has something new on its plate. The California-based company unveiled Impossible Pork and Impossible Sausage on Monday evening at the CES gadget show in Las Vegas. It's Impossible Food's first foray beyond fake beef. The Impossible Burger, which went on sale in 2016, has been a key player in the growing category of vegan meats. Like the burger, Impossible Food's pork and sausage are made from soy but mimic the taste and texture of ground meat. Burger King will give consumers their first taste of Impossible Sausage. Later this month, 139 Burger King restaurants in five US cities will offer the Impossible Croissan'wich, made with plant-based sausage coupled with the traditional egg and cheese. Burger King did a similar test of the Impossible Whopper last year before expanding sales nationwide. — ASSOCIATED PRESS

GM sees more woes ahead for its business in China
General Motors Co. warned pressure on its China business will persist this year as the world's biggest auto market suffers a prolonged slump, exacerbated by a lackluster economy and the trade war with the United States. GM and its partners sold 3.09 million vehicles in China in 2019, according to a statement Tuesday. That represents a 15 percent decline for a company that was once the top foreign automaker in China. — BLOOMBERG NEWS

The case for witnesses at Trump Senate impeachment trial gets stronger every day: Schumer

Texto completo: After months of investigation, the House of Representatives has impeached President Donald Trump for abusing the powers of his office for personal gain and obstructing Congress in the investigation of those matters. As my colleagues return from the holiday recess, one question looms before the Senate: Will we now fulfill our duty to conduct a fair impeachment trial of the president and properly consider these extremely serious charges?
A fair trial is one that examines all the relevant facts and allows senators to make an informed decision based on those facts. And central to getting at the facts is summoning witnesses and a specific set of documents. Both presidential impeachment trials in our nation’s history featured witnesses. In fact, witnesses were called in almost every impeachment trial of any official in Senate history, according to information provided by the Senate Historical Office.
That is why I have called for the Senate to issue subpoenas for relevant documents and testimony from four current and former senior members of the administration with firsthand knowledge of the delay of military assistance to Ukraine and the efforts to pressure Ukraine to announce investigations of the president’s political rival. The witnesses are John Bolton, the president's former national security adviser; Mick Mulvaney, the president's acting chief of staff; Robert Blair, senior adviser to the chief of staff; and Michael Duffey, associate director for national security at the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).
Witnesses needed more than ever
Since Congress recessed for the holidays, several events have significantly bolstered the need to hear from these witnesses and obtain the related documents:
On Dec. 20, the Center for Public Integrity obtained emails through a Freedom of Information Act request that showed that 91 minutes after President Trump’s July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Duffey asked the Defense Department to “hold off” on sending military aid to Ukraine.
On Dec. 29, a New York Times report included several revelations about Mulvaney’s involvement in the delayed military assistance; about the effort by lawyers at the OMB, the Department of Justice and the White House to justify the delay; and about the alarm that the delay caused within the administration, particularly the Pentagon.
Last Thursday, the Just Security blog cited a trove of newly unredacted emails that further exposed the serious concerns raised by Trump administration officials about the propriety and legality of the president’s decision to delay military assistance to Ukraine. One of those emails was from Duffey to the Pentagon comptroller: “Clear direction from POTUS (the president) to continue to hold. ”
Senate and its conscience: Trump impeachment trial could be a partisan sham or a master class in civic duty
On Friday, despite a court order mandating that the White House comply with a FOIA request by The Times, the White House announced that it was withholding in full 20 emails between Blair and Duffey, in which they presumably discuss the freezing of military aid to Ukraine.
And just this week, Bolton announced that he would comply with a Senate subpoena compelling his testimony. Given that his lawyers have stated he has new relevant information to share, we must hear his side of the story along with the other three witnesses.
Senate must shed light on the truth
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is very clear that he has no intention of conducting a fair trial that examines all of the evidence. But thankfully, the rules of the impeachment trial will be determined by a majority of all senators, not by the Republican leader alone. Right now, there are 47 Democrats and 53 Republicans in the Senate, which means four Republicans will make the difference between a trial that is fair, and a trial that serves as little more than a cover-up for the president’s misconduct.
Sen. Tim Kaine: My colleagues must be impartial in Donald Trump's impeachment trial
We are not asking for critics of the president to serve as witnesses in a trial. We are asking that the president’s men — his top advisers — tell their story, and for the Senate to have access to the documents that will shed light on the truth.
The bottom line is simple: There was an exceedingly strong case to call witnesses and request documents before the Senate recessed for the Christmas break. Since then, that case has gotten even stronger.

Searching for information on Iran's missile strike? Google, YouTube lean on trusted sources; Facebook doesn't

Texto completo: Searches for information about Iran's missile strike against U. S. troops at a pair of Iraqi military bases Tuesday night were more right than wrong on Google and YouTube, a change from past situations that saw fake stories rise to the top.
Searches on Facebook, however, took users to non-trusted sources in other countries, and to organizations most USA TODAY readers wouldn't be familiar with.
Google and YouTube produced stories from news organizations most of us have grown up with. A search for "Iran attacks United States" produced results from the New York Times, Fox, CNN, CBS, BBC, Bloomberg and others, as well as tweets from President Donald Trump, Iran's prime minister and a Washington Post reporter, while YouTube had much of the same, minus the tweets.
Facebook, which has vowed many times to clean up its act after tampering by the Russians in the 2016 election, pointed users to video reports from mostly unknown sources.
The search for the same query produced three videos, a Pakistan journalist named Awami Awaz, a "personal blog" called "Army Power" and WION from India.
None had the blue "verified" check mark, which Facebook shows to verify to users that these are trusted sources.
On Twitter, it wasn't hard to find some misleading tweets, like the one from self-described screenwriter Mark Hughes saying that 20 soldiers had died, or Breitbart's announcement as fact that comedian George Lopez had agreed to assassinate Trump. (That was part of a routine. )
On YouTube, misleading headlines could play havoc with viewers. The U. S. has not declared war on Iran. But South Africa's SABC TV posed the question: "Has the US just declared war?"
A non-trusted source, a YouTuber named Gmshawaii Ba, said flatly, "The draft is coming back. "
And the obviously parody International Inquirer used this headline: "12 year old children now eligible for draft. " Not when there isn't one.
Meanwhile, the internet is ripe with "deepfake," videos, which have been reedited and computer-altered to look real.
How to tell if the video is fake? Start with trusted sources. Does it come from a reliable news organization you've lived with all your life, or someone you've never heard of?
Is the video low-resolution or grainy? Is it a single person talking in the video? Is it relatively short -- say 30 seconds or 60 seconds long? Those are usually telltale signs the video is potentially fake.
Some of the other telltale signs discernible to the naked eye, according to Subbarao Kambhampati, a computer science professor at Arizona State University: Different-size eyes or ill-formed teeth, or more than two eyes, or inconsistencies in the background of the video.

Texto completo: A reimagined version of a family sitcom debuts on Freeform. And after Phoebe Waller-Bridge's Golden Globes glory, revisit her breakout show on Netflix.
What's on TV
PARTY OF FIVE 9 p.m. on Freeform. Almost 20 years after its original run ended, the sitcom "Party of Five" is returning to television -- with a jolt of modern political weight. The series, which debuted in 1994 and ran for six seasons, centered on a group of siblings who supported themselves after their parents died in a car crash. (It didn't always go smoothly.) The new version, helmed by the series's original creators, departs from the original story line in a major way: This time, the family members are on their own because their parents are deported to Mexico, not killed. And one sibling is a Dreamer. "This is an opportunity to really get into the perspective of a group of people in this country that has been marginalized -- and on many occasions villainized -- and just show they are people, too," Michal Zebede, a co-executive producer and writer on the series, said in a recent interview with The New York Times.
What's Streaming
CRASHING Stream on Netflix. Phoebe Waller-Bridge was one of the big winners at the Golden Globes on Sunday night: Her series "Fleabag" took home the award for best comedy or musical series, and she won an acting award for her performance in that show. Those who have already seen "Fleabag" (available on Amazon) and want more of Waller-Bridge's mucky humor can turn to "Crashing," the saucy sitcom that set her television career in motion. The show is about a group of 20-somethings who live together in a derelict hospital. Written by Waller-Bridge, it's a fast-paced grab bag of filthy jokes -- and it can be watched in its entirety in under three hours.
BLACK MOTHER (2019) Stream on Criterion Channel and Topic. The filmmaker Khalik Allah trained his eye on Jamaica in this, his most recent documentary, which he told the British magazine Dazed in 2018 is "intended to show Jamaica from the inside-out." The film offers an idiosyncratic visual collage of footage from that country -- with a focus on its women, and on members of Allah's family. "In its poetic, elliptical, concise way, this film makes a grand statement: The black mother is the mother of life itself," Glenn Kenny wrote in his review for The Times. "And the gaze directed at the black faces and bodies in 'Black Mother' is not a male gaze, or a documentarian's gaze. It is a gaze of love."
THE ART OF SELF DEFENSE (2019) Stream on Hulu; Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. Jesse Eisenberg plays a nervous, lonely accountant who gets swept under the influence of a local sensei (Alessandro Nivola) in this dark comedy. The absurd results include Eisenberg's character karate-chopping a rearview mirror off a pickup truck. "The vibe is less 'Karate Kid' than 'Fight Club,' minus the aggressive stylistic poses and the apocalyptic mumbo-jumbo," A.O. Scott wrote in his review for The Times. He called the film, which was written and directed by Riley Stearns, "a wobbly sort-of satire."

Texto completo: The new musical, now wrapping up an Off Broadway run, will open at the Lyceum Theater in April.
"Sing Street," a new musical about a group of Dublin schoolboys who find their voices by forming a band, will transfer to Broadway this spring.
The musical, now running Off Broadway at New York Theater Workshop, will begin performances March 26 and open April 19 at the Lyceum Theater, which, with just over 900 seats, is among the smaller Broadway houses.
"Sing Street," like many Broadway musicals, began its life as a film: a 2016 Irish romantic comedy written and directed by John Carney.
The stage version has a book by Enda Walsh, an Irish playwright who won a Tony Award for "Once," which he also adapted from a Carney film. The musical is being directed by Rebecca Taichman, who won a Tony for "Indecent," and choreographed by Sonya Tayeh, who also oversees the dance in this season's "Moulin Rouge!"
The "Sing Street" score is made up of nine songs written for the movie by Carney and Gary Clark (including one that was cut from the film), as well as fragments of '80s pop songs (including "Rio," a Duran Duran song also used in the film).
The Off Broadway production has sold well, but got mixed reviews from critics; Ben Brantley, writing in The New York Times, called it "promising but still unfulfilled."
Taichman said on Tuesday that the creative team was already at work revising the show.
"We're looking at a lot of things -- among them, how to nail the tone of the piece exactly right, and how to explode the world of New Romantics and synthesizers and 1980s pop music into the room more," she said. "We have listened to the wonderful audiences we've had, and have learned a tremendous amount, and we are now thrilled to have the opportunity to make the show better."
The musical is being produced by Barbara Broccoli, Brian Carmody, Patrick Milling Smith, Michael Wilson, Orin Wolf and Frederick Zollo; it is being capitalized for up to $ 11 million, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
"Sing Street" is the 10th new musical announced for the current Broadway season.

#MeToo's day in court; Whether Harvey Weinstein is convicted or not, seeing him finally face charges for his alleged actions is a balm

Texto completo: Harvey Weinstein hobbled into a New York court Monday, leaning on a walker cushioned by two bright green tennis balls. Bent and shuffling, he no longer appeared to be the entitled movie mogul who believed he could help himself to any woman he desired.
Instead, the man whose sexual bullying helped fuel the rage behind the #MeToo movement now appears weak, pale and pathetic. It all feels very calculated.
Just last month, he told the New York Post that he's the victim here.

"I feel like the forgotten man," he told the Post. "I made more movies directed by women and about women than any filmmaker, and I'm talking about 30 years ago.... I did it first! I pioneered it! It all got eviscerated because of what happened."
Note the semantic sleight of hand: "because of what happened," not "because of what I did."
Though more than 80 women have accused the once-fearsome producer of sexual misconduct over decades, he is facing charges in this trial for the harm he is alleged to have inflicted on only two: a woman who says he raped her in a Manhattan hotel in 2013 and another who says he forced oral sex on her at his home in 2006.
In an excellent turn of events, he may also face a second criminal trial. On Monday, Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Jackie Lacey announced she would file four counts of rape and sexual battery against Weinstein involving alleged sexual attacks on two women in hotels in Los Angeles and Beverly Hills in 2013, just before that year's Oscars.
Whether he will be convicted on any of these counts is far from certain, but just seeing him in court is a balm.
"It's good to see Lady Justice staring him down," said one of his earliest accusers, Rose McGowan. "It feels like a huge win already."
Weinstein's wretched behavior left a trail of destruction behind him: The ruined or stymied careers of women who fought him off at their own peril, the stars who got work only at a steep cost to their well-being, the enablers and defenders who tossed their scruples out the window to protect him by helping silence accusers with financial settlements, which came with nondisclosure agreements that enabled him to continue behaving as he always had.
I can't look at Weinstein without thinking about Bill Cosby, who finally got what was coming, and now sits, remorseless, in a Pennsylvania jail. Or men like Matt Lauer, Les Moonves, Charlie Rose and dozens of others who lost their jobs but never really took responsibility for their actions.
But have things changed?
Certainly, that's the case in the upper professional echelons. One year after the Weinstein scandal broke, the New York Times reported that of the 201 powerful men who lost their jobs as a result of sexual misconduct allegations, nearly half were replaced by women.
Tanzina Vega replaced John Hockenberry on WNYC's "The Takeaway." Jennifer Salke replaced Roy Price as head of Amazon Studios. Alex Wagner replaced Mark Halperin as co-host of Showtime's "The Circus." Rachel Rosenfelt replaced Hamilton Fish as publisher/president of the New Republic, and she was herself replaced last year by another woman, Kerrie Gillis.
At least a dozen states have passed new legislation addressing workplace sexual harassment, including California, the leader of the pack, which not only tightened laws on harassment and non-disclosure agreements, but also now requires that publicly traded companies based in the state appoint women to their boards.
On Monday morning, I watched a live feed of Weinstein's courthouse entrance, then a nearby news conference by seven of his accusers, including McGowan, Rosanna Arquette and TV journalist Lauren Sivan. They call themselves the Silence Breakers. "Living in silence," McGowan said, "is a death sentence for your soul."
The women watched as Weinstein entered the court flanked by attorneys and beefy bodyguards.
"Did you see the thugs who were protecting him?" asked Arquette. "Like a Scorcese movie!"
Sivan genially introduced herself as "the potted plant girl."
In 2007, at a Manhattan business dinner, she has alleged, Weinstein lured her into the restaurant section of a club he had invested in, trapped her, then masturbated into a potted plant when she refused him.
"I'm OK being known as 'the potted plant girl' as long as he's forever known as the predator ... that he is," she said.
Sivan has the distinction of having been targeted by both Weinstein and Roger Ailes, the late Fox News Network chairman who both personally fostered and allowed a culture of harassment to flourish at the network until he was exposed by former Fox anchor Gretchen Carlson, who sued him personally. Carlson won $20 million and an apology.
Jury selection in the Weinstein case began Tuesday. The trial is expected to last weeks.
As for his fear of being forgotten, Sivan said, he shouldn't worry for a single moment.
"We will definitely remember him," she said. "He put MeToo on the map, a movement that has taken over the country and the world. He has changed sexual harassment policies in workplaces around the nation, even in our own government. He has made it more effective and safe for people to report sexual harassment and abuse."
Heck of a legacy, Harvey.

Texto completo: Boeing Co. is recommending that airlines put pilots through simulator training before they fly the 737 Max, a stunning reversal that is intended to reassure the flying public of the grounded jetliner's safety after two deadly crashes.
The plane maker has notified the Federal Aviation Administration of the shift in its views, and the U.S. regulator will make a final decision. Boeing is looking at modifying simulators of an older 737 model, given the shortage of equipment designed specifically for the Max, said a person familiar with the matter who asked not to be named because the discussions were still private.
Boeing is abandoning its earlier stance that pilots of the earlier 737 version would need only computer-based instruction to fly the Max -- a key selling point because it would enable airlines to avoid taking pilots out of the field for pricey simulator sessions. Although adding the new requirement isn't expected to affect the timing of the Max's recertification by global regulators, the person said, the move could create new delays as airlines scramble to train pilots.

"Safety is Boeing's top priority," Greg Smith, Boeing's interim chief executive, said in a statement. "Public, customer and stakeholder confidence in the 737 Max is critically important to us, and with that focus Boeing has decided to recommend Max simulator training combined with computer-based training for all pilots prior to returning the Max safely to service."
The final determination on pilot preparation will be made by the FAA and its regulatory counterparts around the world. The agency confirmed Boeing's recommendations for flight crew simulator training in an emailed statement.
"The FAA is following a thorough process, not a set timeline, to ensure that any design modifications to the 737 Max are integrated with appropriate training and procedures," it said in the statement.
Boeing shares climbed 1.1% on Tuesday.
The Chicago aerospace giant decided to recommend simulator training after inviting airline pilots to test redesigned Max flight-control software in early December. Although all of the aviators were able to safely resolve issues in those sessions, some failed to follow the company's checklists, said a person briefed on the matter.
Pilot training remains a major issue as Boeing works through the final milestones with regulators toward recertifying the 737 Max for flight. Requiring simulator sessions creates new logistical headaches for airlines that could lengthen the time between when the grounding is lifted and when the plane is worked back into airline schedules.
Southwest Airlines Co., the largest 737 Max customer, said in a statement before Boeing's announcement that it was confident that computer-based training would have been sufficient to supplement its existing training program.
"That being said, we stand ready to comply with the FAA's final recommendation and have teams within Southwest that are considering training models for both simulator or computer-based training programs," the carrier said.
"Since our plans are in the early stages as we await further guidance, we don't have any time or cost estimates to offer."
Boeing's decision on simulator training was reported earlier by the New York Times.
The training recommendation by Boeing reverses an FAA advisory group's tentative proposal in April and suggests that there is growing momentum for at least some simulator-based training before thousands of pilots around the world can resume flying the Max. The plane has been grounded worldwide since March.
The Flight Standardization Board report from April was opened for public comment, but it was never finalized as Boeing made extensive changes to the flight control system's architecture over the following months.
The board is awaiting input from a group of international pilots known as the Joint Operations Evaluation Board, which will conduct "rigorous validation testing that will help the FAA and other international regulators evaluate proposed flight training and emergency procedures," the FAA said in a statement.

Texto completo: This week's strong tremors are a reminder that the Caribbean is an active seismic zone.
Puerto Rico has been trembling for more than a week.
An earthquake with a preliminary magnitude of 6.4 struck off the coast of the island at 4:24 a.m. local time on Tuesday, according to the United States Geological Survey. That came after a week of smaller tremors clustered in the same area offshore.
Three strong aftershocks, with preliminary estimates of 5.6, 5.2 and 4.5 magnitude, followed Tuesday's big quake. A bigger aftershock, of 5.8 magnitude, hit at 7:18 a.m. local time. The temblors knocked out power to much of the island, seriously damaging homes and buildings and leaving at least one person dead.
Tuesday's shaking followed a 5.8-magnitude quake and aftershocks that leveled homes on Monday. There were dozens of smaller earthquakes on Tuesday within a few miles along the southwestern coast of the island, according to the United States Geological Survey.
"Things are really very tense about what has been going on because this is not normal -- so many tremors," Mayor Nelson Torres Yordán of Guayanilla said this week.
But the Caribbean, a region that faces the threat of hurricanes from the Atlantic in late summer and early fall, is also subject to seismic hazards like those striking Puerto Rico this week.
Why are there so many earthquakes in Puerto Rico right now?
At about three times the size of Rhode Island, Puerto Rico is squeezed between the border of the North American and Caribbean tectonic plates.
The Puerto Rico Trench, north of Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands, is an undersea fault zone. The North American plate is sliding under the Caribbean plate there, creating the potential for earthquakes and undersea landslides that can set off tsunamis.
"We're just as likely to have earthquakes as a place like California, Japan, New Zealand, Alaska," said Elizabeth Vanacore, a seismologist with the Puerto Rico Seismic Network.
When the tectonic plates in the region slide past each other and squeeze together, energy and stress build up until one side of a fault pops up, unleashing an earthquake. The earthquakes redistribute stresses along the fault for a time, until those stresses build up again and new tremors occur.
The North American plate is edging south and sinking underneath the Caribbean plate at about 2 centimeters per year, according to Gavin Hayes, a research geophysicist at the United States Geological Survey. To the south, the Caribbean plate is moving in the opposite direction, northward, at a similar rate.
"They are converging at a relatively low rate in comparison to plate boundaries around the world," he said. In South America, it can be as high as 6 centimeters per year, while in the southwest Pacific it is up to 10 centimeters per year. Slower convergence rates mean strain builds up more slowly, making earthquakes either smaller or more rare, he said.
Should residents be worried about a tsunami?
Mayita Meléndez, mayor of Ponce, said people living near beaches are desperate to get out of their homes for fear of tsunamis. "It's not safe," Ms. Meléndez said. "The earth is moving constantly."
Early Tuesday morning, the United States National Tsunami Warning Center said there was no tsunami threat from that morning's earthquake. The local authorities initially issued a tsunami watch before canceling it, according to Puerto Rico's emergency management agency.
A tsunami happens when a quake on the seabed suddenly pushes water upward, producing a perilously towering wave. In 1918, an earthquake near the island's northwestern coast triggered a tsunami that killed 118 people, according to the geological service.
How rare are earthquakes in the region?
Puerto Rico has seen damaging quakes before, but major earthquakes in the southwestern part of the island are unusual in recent history.
The last significant temblors recorded in that area, in 1991 and 1999, had a magnitude of about 4.1, according to the Puerto Rico Seismic Network, whose data dates to 1986.
Most of the seismic activity has occurred in the underwater band to the north of the island, close to where the tectonic plate boundary is. The geological survey has recorded 61 earthquakes of 4.5 magnitude or within about 50 miles of the northern shoreline since 2009.
Major earthquakes have regularly devastated cities in the Caribbean, including Kingston, the capital of Jamaica, which was destroyed twice in three centuries. Ten years ago, a 7.0-magnitude earthquake struck Haiti on Jan. 12, killing more than 200,000 people and destroying tens of thousands of buildings.
"Puerto Ricans should be aware that they live in a tectonically active region," Mr. Hayes said. "Earthquakes can be expected any time." He emphasized the importance of building to seismic codes.
Is it safe to travel to Puerto Rico?
Seismologists said that more earthquakes are expected to be felt on the island in the next few days because the seismic activity is occurring close to land. But the frequency of aftershocks is expected to slow down over time, which means the chances of another intense earthquake will also fall.
Arrivals and departures at the international airport in San Juan, which was running on generators, were operating on or close to schedule Tuesday morning.

Texto completo: As it aims to stem the flow of migrants from Africa and bring about change in a dictatorship, the European Union is spending millions on projects built by people in forced conscription.
BRUSSELS -- The European Union spent 20 million euros last year in Eritrea, hoping to help stem an exodus from the repressive African country, which is consistently one of its biggest sources of asylum seekers.
The money, about $ 22 million, bought equipment and materials to build a road, a seemingly uncontroversial task. The catch? Many workers on the construction site are forced conscripts, and the European Union has no real means of monitoring the project.
The decision caused outrage in human-rights circles. But that did not stop the bloc in December from deciding to give Eritrea tens of millions more, funding a system of forced conscription that the United Nations has described as "tantamount to enslavement."
The additional aid, of €95 million, has not been previously reported, and is a jarring example of the quandary facing the European Union as it scrambles to drastically curb migration.
When it comes to Eritrea, a closed nation of about five million people in the Horn of Africa, the bloc has little real oversight of the projects it is funding, and it has decided not to make its aid conditional on guarantees of democratic reforms.
The money is part of a €4.6 billion European Union Trust Fund for Africa, a special fund created at the height of the refugee crisis in 2015 to "address the root causes of migration."
While that plan is supported by a broad consensus, its execution has tarnished what many see as a worthy goal, even raising questions of whether it has become counterproductive.
The flow of asylum seekers out of Eritrea remains consistently high. At least 5,000 Eritreans have sought asylum in Europe every year in the past decade. In 2015 and 2016, the number peaked at over 30,000, and last year it was more than 10,000.
At least 80 percent of the requests were successful, according to Eurostat, the European Union statistics agency, meaning that European countries overwhelmingly consider Eritreans legitimate refugees.
European officials and migration experts believe that Eritreans will continue to arrive in the thousands, even as overall numbers of new migrants drop from mid-decade highs.
That drop is more to do with a crackdown at Europe's Mediterranean borders, through agreements with Turkey and Libya, than with funding to Africa or the Middle East.
The European Union trust fund is a long-term approach, even as it has become an immediate part of the bloc's thickening forward defense against migration as it tries to address it at its source in Africa.
Its endowment is being spent across the continent, with special focus on the countries that send the highest numbers of asylum seekers to Europe.
Since the trust was declared "emergency" funding, it is not subject to the stringent procurement and oversight demands that normally accompany European Union spending.
When it comes to Eritrea, European officials have switched to what they call "a dual-track approach" -- talking with the government while also giving it money, irrespective of outcomes.
In all, €200 million from the fund is earmarked for Eritrea. The hope is that the money will help lift the local economy, create jobs, keep Eritreans at home and cement the peace agreement with its erstwhile enemy Ethiopia that was reached in mid-2018.
Overlooked or ignored in the calculation, the European Union's critics say, is the appalling record of an Eritrean government that is considered one of the world's worst human-rights abusers.
After a 30-year guerrilla war, Eritrea gained independence from Ethiopia in 1991. The two sides went to war again over their border, from 1998 to 2000, after Ethiopia refused to abide by an international ruling. Eritrea's rebel-leader-turned-president, Isaias Afwerki, has maintained a state of emergency ever since.
As part of that state of emergency, a National Service program of mandatory, universal and indefinite conscription has remained in place, even after the 2018 peace agreement, a breakthrough that won Ethiopia's leader the Nobel Peace Prize.
"Despite the peace agreement with Ethiopia, the human rights situation in Eritrea remains dire," said Laetitia Bader, who covers the country and broader region for Human Rights Watch. "The government continues to conscript much of its population into indefinite national service and hold scores of political detainees in inhumane conditions."
Eritreans are trapped within this system, and the country, since an exit visa is required to leave. Many remain conscripted into their 40s, doing civilian or military jobs for little pay.
Human-rights groups and the United Nations say that conscript work in Eritrea, which keeps the country running, amounts to forced labor. The United States has long suspended aid and development funding to the country.
The European Commission, the European Union's executive branch, said that it had "been informed" by the government that conscripts would be used for its road project.
The details of how this project is set up show that it has been carefully designed to ensure that the European Union is not seen to be directly paying for conscripts to work on the construction site.
"The E.U. does not pay for labor under this project," the European Commission said in written replies to questions from The New York Times. "The project only covers the procurement of material and equipment to support the rehabilitation of roads."
The Commission, which has contracted the United Nations Office for Project Services to manage the project on its behalf, said that both it and the United Nations agency paid "particular attention to ensuring that minimum standards for health and safety of the workers involved in the road rehabilitation sites are ensured."
But the agency does not have an office in Eritrea and says it is checking on the project through visits organized by the Eritrean government.
In response to questions, it said that it was not monitoring the work either, but rather that the Eritrean government was monitoring itself. The agency "is not monitoring the implementation of the project," a spokesperson said. "The project is carried out by the government and progress is monitored by the Ministry of Public Works."
Asked how many conscripts worked on the project and what their salaries were, the agency said it did "not have access to this information" -- contradicting what the Commission has said about the level of detail provided to the agency.
Asked whether it saw a problem with facilitating a project that engages conscript labor in Eritrea, a practice denounced by other United Nations branches, the agency said that it "respects core U.N. principles, including the elimination of all forms of forced or compulsory labor," but decided to proceed anyway.
The European Union's change in approach to Eritrea is part of a broader coming in from the cold for the country, as world powers take an interest in the geopolitically crucial Horn of Africa and Eritrea's long coastline along the Red Sea.
The United Arab Emirates in recent years set up a huge base on the Eritrean coast to support its war effort in Yemen directly across the water. The Red Sea is also a critical passage for ships carrying goods and oil to Europe through the Suez Canal.
Officials involved in shaping Europe's Eritrea policy said that the bloc did not want to be left out of that unfolding "game," which has become more active since the peace with Ethiopia and the subsequent lifting of longstanding United Nations sanctions against Eritrea over its links to regional armed groups.
"The rapprochement with Ethiopia and removal of U.N. sanctions allow the E.U. to try to foster development of Eritrea's moribund economy and coax the government away from its repressive ways through engagement and patience," said William Davison of the International Crisis Group, a research organization.
Mr. Afwerki has been remarkably successful in keeping control of the country without compromising or heeding calls to change.
Recently, however, the government has indicated that the National Service could be incrementally reduced once enough jobs open up to absorb the conscripts.
The European Union said it disapproved of Eritrea's national service policy, despite the conscripts' use of European-funded tools.
"The E.U. does not support indefinite national service in Eritrea and continues to push for reform to the national service through its reinforced political dialogue with the government," the European Commission said.
"Human rights," it added, "are at the core of all of the E.U.'s external actions."

Texto completo: Two attorneys say legal representation "would level the playing field for tenants facing eviction."
To the Editor:
Re "Eviction Crises That a Few Hundred Dollars Could Solve" (Business, Dec. 18):
While the holiday season brought tidings of joy for some, many people go through the cold winter months facing eviction and homelessness. Many are renters who are shut out of their homes over only a few hundred dollars, often less than one month's rent.
In U.S. eviction cases, 90 percent of renters don't have the means to access legal representation, while 90 percent of landlords do. To help curb this trend, we need to implement a big, but simple, solution nationwide: a tenant's right to counsel. This would level the playing field for tenants facing eviction.
In cities with a right to counsel, like Philadelphia, lawyers help keep renters in their homes. They enter payment agreements with landlords. They negotiate to have repairs made, so tenants don't have to withhold rent. By doing so, they prevent homelessness, saving cities millions of dollars in the cost of social services.
It's time to promote fairness and adopt right to counsel nationwide.

Texto completo: The Trump campaign's digital ads herald the death of Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, a top Iranian commander. They then direct voters to the "Official Trump Military Survey."
On Thursday, President Trump ordered a drone strike that killed Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, the powerful Iranian military commander. By Monday, the Trump campaign was running ads on Facebook touting the general's death.
"Thanks to the swift actions of our commander in chief, Iranian General Qassem Soleimani is no longer a threat to the United States, or to the world," several of the Trump ads read, using an alternate spelling of the Iranian general's name. Some featured pictures of a beaming Mr. Trump from one of his campaign rallies; others showed a stoic, finger-waving president, also in front of supporters.
The ads asked voters to take the "Official Trump Military Survey," directing users to Mr. Trump's re-election campaign website.
All told, the Trump campaign has run nearly 800 distinct Facebook ads about the killing of General Suleimani, according to Acronym, a progressive digital strategy group. Political campaigns often run many digital ads with similar versions of a message, and Mr. Trump's campaign is among the most prolific advertisers on Facebook, often running hundreds of ads with subtle differences.
It is not yet known how much the campaign has spent on the ads because Facebook's public ad database does not immediately report such figures. But Advertising Analytics, an ad tracking firm, said the Trump campaign had spent at least $ 8,000 on the ads so far.
The advertising campaign is running as tensions between the United States and Iran ramp up. Iran's supreme leader is vowing retribution against the United States, the Pentagon is at odds with Mr. Trump over threatening Iranian cultural sites, and some Democrats have suggested that the president may have ordered the strike to take attention away from the looming Senate impeachment trial.
The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
These types of ads, known as acquisition ads, are intended to help campaigns gather more information about internet users with the goal of turning them into online donors.
Most of the Trump campaign's Suleimani ads work the same way. First, potential voters are shown the ad. Clicking on it brings them to a brief survey on the Trump campaign's website, which asks questions like, "Do you believe America has the greatest military in the world?" The survey also asks for a name, email address and phone number, which the campaign can then add to its database of potential donors.
Users who submit the survey are also prompted to donate right away, with a message that says, "President Trump is keeping AMERICA SAFE! Now it's time to step up and stand behind him." Donation buttons ranging from $ 42 to $ 2,800 appear below the text.
Though online surveys are an exceptionally common form of political advertising and fund-raising, the use of General Suleimani's death in the advertisements is likely to draw criticism from Democrats.
Other presidents have run advertisements during re-election campaigns that have tried to capitalize on major military events -- and have also been accused of trying to politicize them.
During President Barack Obama's re-election campaign in 2012, his team produced a digital video about the raid that killed Osama bin Laden. The video praised Mr. Obama's decision making and asked, "Which path would Mitt Romney have taken?"
Joseph R. Biden Jr., who was vice president at the time, said that Mr. Obama's re-election slogan should be, "Osama bin Laden is dead, and General Motors is alive."
And last year, Mr. Trump ran hundreds of Facebook ads about the death of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of the Islamic State. Those ads began running a day after the news of his killing was made public.
"President Trump has brought the #1 terrorist leader to justice. He is KEEPING AMERICA SAFE," one ad said. Others cited "the fierce leadership of our commander in chief."
They also directed users to surveys on the campaign website.

Texto completo: The authorities said they suspect Carole Ghosn gave false testimony in April related to the allegations against her husband.
TOKYO -- The Japanese authorities said on Tuesday that they had issued a warrant for the arrest of Carole Ghosn, the wife of Carlos Ghosn, taking direct aim at the family of the fallen auto magnate as they sought to bring him back to the country to face criminal charges.
Prosecutors in Tokyo said they had obtained an arrest warrant for Mrs. Ghosn, 53, on suspicion of giving false testimony nine months ago. In a statement, they said Mrs. Ghosn had testified that she did not know a person who was involved in Mr. Ghosn's case, even though she was in communication with that person while the person was wiring money between companies at Mr. Ghosn's request.
The statement did not disclose the identities of the person or the companies.
The arrest warrant is the latest twist in an international tale of intrigue. Mr. Ghosn, the architect of the Nissan-Renault-Mitsubishi auto empire, faces charges of financial wrongdoing in Japan. But he fled the country on Dec. 29, flying on private jets first to Turkey and then to Lebanon. Mr. Ghosn is a Lebanese national, and the nation does not extradite its citizens.
In an additional development, the air charter company that flew Mr. Ghosn said in a statement on Tuesday that it was paid only half of the $ 350,000 fee for the Japan-to-Turkey flight, and that it had received no compensation at all for the second flight from Turkey to Lebanon.
The Ghosn family could not be reached for comment. Mrs. Ghosn, who is a citizen of both Lebanon and the United States, denounced the Japanese arrest warrant in an interview published Tuesday in the French newspaper Le Parisien, calling it "an act of revenge by the prosecutors" meant to put pressure on her husband.
"I find this a belittling act from an alleged great democracy," she said in the interview, which the newspaper said was conducted in an exclusive hotel in Achrafieh, a neighborhood in eastern Beirut. "I have already been humiliated in Japan, where I have been accused of running away from justice, when this is absolutely false."
It is not clear how the Japanese arrest warrant would affect her ability to return to the United States, which has an extradition agreement with Japan, or to travel to other countries with extensive ties to Japan.
If she were to travel to the United States, an extradition request from Japan would have to go through diplomatic channels. The Justice and State Departments would review the request and then present it to a federal magistrate for a hearing.
In France, Mr. Ghosn is a citizen but his wife is not. France does not extradite its citizens, but a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Justice, speaking generally, said that "it's a different case" for someone who is not a French citizen.
While she is in Lebanon, Japan's options are limited. The authorities in Tokyo have pressed Lebanon to return Mr. Ghosn, a Lebanese citizen, though they acknowledged that Lebanese law forbids the extradition of a citizen.
The Japanese ambassador on Tuesday met with Lebanon's president, Michel Aoun, but afterward there was no sign that they had made progress toward resolving the issue. A Japanese Justice Ministry official said on Tuesday that the authorities were reviewing Lebanese law and working with Japan's Foreign Ministry.
Japanese officials prompted Interpol, the international criminal information clearinghouse, to issue what is known as a red notice regarding Mr. Ghosn; such notices are issued internationally for people wanted for prosecution or to serve a sentence. But red notices essentially function as a diplomatic request for help, not as an international arrest warrant, and they do not obligate governments to comply.
Mrs. Ghosn has been a vocal defender of her husband. In April, in an interview with The New York Times, she described how the Japanese authorities treated her "like a terrorist" when they arrested him again in April at a home in Tokyo where they were staying while he was free on bail on earlier charges.
On Wednesday, Mr. Ghosn is expected to speak for himself at a news conference in Beirut.
Mrs. Ghosn was formerly involved in the fashion industry, and she was previously married to Marwan Marshi, a banker of Lebanese-Palestinian origin in New York, according to a relative of Mr. Marshi who asked not to be named in order to discuss the couple's personal life. The couple was involved in philanthropy, and Mrs. Ghosn met Mr. Ghosn at a charity event in New York, according to a friend of Mr. Ghosn who also asked not to be named.
Also on Tuesday, Japan's land and transportation minister, Kazuyoshi Akaba, said that major airports with terminals for private jets would be required to inspect large baggage items that pass through them. The stepped-up measures followed reports that Mr. Ghosn escaped through Kansai International Airport in Osaka, Japan, while hiding in a large box that was loaded onto a private aircraft.
Japanese officials have also said that they confiscated the 1.5 billion yen, or nearly $ 14 million, in bail that Mr. Ghosn forfeited when he fled the country.
Last week, MNG Jet, the air charter company that operated the flights that Mr. Ghosn used to leave Japan, brought a criminal complaint against its operations manager, Okan Kosemen. It said Mr. Kosemen had deceived the company after the news broke that Mr. Ghosn had flown on two of the private jets it managed. MNG Jet is a subsidiary of MNG, a large Turkish construction conglomerate.
Mr. Kosemen, who has been detained by the Turkish authorities on charges of falsifying records and transporting an undocumented migrant, arranged the contracts for both flights, according to MNG Jet. A lawyer for Mr. Kosemen, Mehmet Fatih Danaci, said he believed his client was innocent.
Documents made available to The New York Times showed an invoice dated Dec. 24 from MNG Jet to "Al Nitaq Al Akhdhar for General Trade Limited" for "TC-TSR Aviation and Logistic Services" for the price of $ 175,000. (TC-TSR refers to the Bombardier aircraft that flew Mr. Ghosn to Turkey.) The invoice, which appeared to be signed by Mr. Kosemen, listed Al Nitaq Al Akhdhar as being based in Dubai.
A second document, dated Dec. 26, showed a payment order by Al Nitaq Al Akhdhar to MNG Jet for $ 175,000. The rest of the money was due upon the completion of the flight.
Efforts to reach Al Nitaq Al Akhdhar were unsuccessful.
A spokesman for MNG said that it did not have access to the contract for the Istanbul-Beirut flight because it was on Mr. Kosemen's computer, which had been seized by investigators, and that it had not received any payment for it at all.
The spokesman, who asked to remain anonymous citing company protocol, said the company had no contact with Al Nitaq Al Akhdhar.
"This was managed by our rogue employee," the spokesman wrote in an email.
Mr. Ghosn was first arrested by the Japanese authorities in November 2018 and was ultimately charged with four counts of financial wrongdoing while running the vast automotive empire. Mr. Ghosn has denied the allegations and said he was set up by Nissan executives who feared that he would more closely combine the operations of the major Japanese automaker with its French partner, Renault.
On Tuesday, Nissan broke its silence on Mr. Ghosn's flight, saying in a statement that an internal investigation had found "numerous acts of misconduct" and that the company would continue to cooperate with the authorities in investigating him.
Nissan kept monitoring Mr. Ghosn even after he was released on bail, the Japanese news media has reported. The reports said that the surveillance stopped shortly before Mr. Ghosn fled.
Junichiro Hironaka, one of Mr. Ghosn's lawyers in Japan, said he noted that the former Nissan executive was under surveillance and filed a criminal complaint with the police on Dec. 27, without specifying a target of the complaint. In a brief interview, he said he did not know whether his complaint led to the cancellation of the surveillance.

Texto completo: Readers discuss whether the former national security adviser might defend the president. Also: Iranian cultural sites; war fears among the young; online hate; legal help for tenants.
To the Editor:
Re "Bolton, in Twist, Offers to Testify at Trump's Trial" (front page, Jan. 7):
Is it a coincidence that John Bolton, immediately after the assassination of Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, agreed to testify in the impeachment trial? It is reported that such testimony would be damning to the president, but is that necessarily so?
As we all know, Mr. Bolton has long advocated military action against Iran. Now that President Trump has initiated a direct attack, isn't it more likely that Mr. Bolton would make every effort to defend him against removal?

To the Editor:
Now that John Bolton, the former national security adviser, has announced that he will testify if subpoenaed by the Senate in its impeachment proceedings, it is up to Mitch McConnell to subpoena him. If Mr. McConnell decides he does not wish to hear what Mr. Bolton has to say, perhaps Mr. Bolton would agree to appear before the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee in a "Phase 2" of its impeachment inquiry?

Denying the Truth
To the Editor:
Re "Pentagon Rules Out Strikes on Antiquities" (front page, Jan. 7):
White House officials are tying themselves in knots trying to say that President Trump did not say he would consider attacking cultural sites in Iran. Even though he said it.

Young, and Fearing War
To the Editor:
Re "A Generation Familiar With War Confronts Fears of Another Conflict" (news article, Jan. 6):
I was 7 years old on Sept. 11, 2001. Unlike many of my generation, I remember my parents' stories of the Vietnam War. In this context, the stories always carried a certain weight of immediacy and the possibility of repetition.
In one vivid tale, my mom recounted the story of a friend who was drafted on the cusp of his 26th birthday, leaving his wife and infant and returning in a flag-draped coffin. I am now 26 years old.
Young people are right to fear war. It touches young people and their families with devastating consequences. While I understand the desire of parents to ease their children's fears, I also sense a false dichotomy: Either surrender to the hype or dismiss it entirely.
To forge a better future, I encourage these young people to instead master the skills that our leaders have not. Rather than letting the hype control our reaction, we must build true resilience, reason, courage and empathy to face circumstances beyond our control.

Ending Online Hate
To the Editor:
Re "Teaching an Old Frog New Tricks" (news article, Dec. 26):
It is true that certain hateful memes or labels may be deemed not hateful because of new uses or contexts, and that platforms should be careful in classifying content as hateful. But the vast preponderance of hate on the internet is immutable, consisting of racist, anti-Semitic, homophobic and other forms of online hate not subject to second-guessing.
A much greater concern than re-evaluating a small category of online content is the failure of internet platforms to do all they can to live up to their promises of a hate-free environment.

A Tenant's Right to Counsel
To the Editor:
Re "Eviction Crises That a Few Hundred Dollars Could Solve" (Business, Dec. 18):
While the holiday season brought tidings of joy for some, many people go through the cold winter months facing eviction and homelessness. Many are renters who are shut out of their homes over only a few hundred dollars, often less than one month's rent.
In U.S. eviction cases, 90 percent of renters don't have the means to access legal representation, while 90 percent of landlords do. To help curb this trend, we need to implement a big, but simple, solution nationwide: a tenant's right to counsel. This would level the playing field for tenants facing eviction.
In cities with a right to counsel, like Philadelphia, lawyers help keep renters in their homes. They enter payment agreements with landlords. They negotiate to have repairs made, so tenants don't have to withhold rent. By doing so, they prevent homelessness, saving cities millions of dollars in the cost of social services.
It's time to promote fairness and adopt right to counsel nationwide.

Texto completo: After a trial that took more than two years, Zhao Li, who killed his millionaire cousin and then chopped up the body, was found guilty of manslaughter.
The lurid court testimony riveted Canada: A Chinese immigrant shot dead his brash, womanizing, millionaire relative at his $ 8 million hillside mansion in Vancouver, and then chopped up the body into 108 pieces before taking a long nap.
In an unexpected ruling on Tuesday, Justice Terence Schultes at the Supreme Court of British Columbia ruled that Zhao Li, now 59, who was a business partner of the victim, Yuan Gang, was not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter and of "interfering with human remains."
Justice Schultes said that while he did not find Mr. Zhao's testimony to be "truthful," he had been left with reasonable doubt over whether Mr. Zhao intended to kill Mr. Yuan. Intention to kill beyond a reasonable doubt is the prerequisite for a murder verdict in Canada.
"Given the brutality of the crime and all the other circumstances, this verdict is surprising," said Chris Johnson, a lawyer who represented the estate of Mr. Yuan, who died a few weeks before his 42nd birthday.
The defense and prosecution agreed on a judge rather than a jury trial.
The trial, which took more than two years and attracted news media attention in China as well as Canada, underlined how Vancouver has become a global sanctuary for foreign money moving from Asia to North America. Mr. Yuan was a millionaire who had gamed the Canadian immigration system, building a business and acquiring Canadian real estate worth millions of dollars.
Mr. Zhao, whose wife is Mr. Yuan's cousin, was portrayed by the defense as a "well-adjusted" and law-abiding man who had been provoked by an indecent proposal from Mr. Yuan asking to marry his daughter. Mr. Zhao did not have murderous intent, his lawyer said, despite the crime's violent aftermath, and so was guilty of manslaughter, not murder.
But the prosecutor countered that Mr. Zhao had confessed the killing to the police, including that he had used a power saw to cut up the body. As the judge read aloud the decision, Mr. Zhao, who was wearing a navy blue suit, stared forward calmly, listening intently to his interpreter.
The judge said the case had hinged on Mr. Zhao's mental state at the time of the shooting and whether he had the intent necessary for the crime to qualify as murder.
There will be a hearing next week to set a date for sentencing. He could face up to life in prison.
"The verdict brings to an end what is surely one of Canada's most gruesome killings, made all the more interesting by the fact that it happened in the wealthy and virtually crime-free enclave of West Vancouver," Mr. Johnson said.
The background of the victim and his lavish lifestyle -- as well as testimony in a related civil case over his estate -- offered a vivid glimpse of the lives of superrich Chinese living in Vancouver, many of whom have invested in real estate and see Canada as a refuge for cash and kin.
In addition to Mr. Yuan, a playboy with a penchant for sprawling houses, luxury cars and taxidermied animals, other figures in the story were a colorful group of family members. Among them was Mr. Zhao's glamorous daughter, Florence Zhao, known as "Flo-Z," an aspiring fashion designer who starred in a popular reality show on YouTube, "Ultra Rich Asian Girls." The series showcased Vancouver's growing class of wealthy second-generation Chinese.
Mr. Yuan was born in Heilongjiang, a province in northeastern China. After becoming wealthy he moved to Canada, where he had previously married and then divorced a Chinese-Canadian woman to help gain permanent residency. While living in Canada, he became ensnared in a corruption and bribery scandal related to his previous business dealings in China.
He also went on a very expensive buying spree in Canada, purchasing two mansions, a Bentley, a Rolls-Royce and a $ 2 million private island.
But Mr. Yuan's glittering new life took a lethal turn after he invited his poorer cousins from Montreal -- Li Xiaomei; her husband, Zhao Li; and their teenage daughter, Florence -- to live with him.
During the trial, Mr. Zhao testified that he had been ruthlessly bullied as a child after his father had opposed the Chinese government and was sent to a forced labor camp.
The Zhaos were increasingly revolted by Mr. Yuan's endless stream of girlfriends -- as many as 100, according to testimony in a separate civil case over Mr. Yuan's estate.
On May 2, 2015, Mr. Yuan told Mr. Zhao that he wanted Florence's hand in marriage.
Mr. Zhao was irate, calling Mr. Yuan "worse than a pig or a dog," according to his testimony at his murder trial. "Even a rabbit will not eat the grass around his nest," he added, referring to incest. (The Zhaos were not Mr. Yuan's blood relatives, since Ms. Li was adopted).
It was at that point, Mr. Zhao said, that Mr. Yuan grabbed him. After a tussle over a hammer, he said, he shot Mr. Yuan twice.
Then, Mr. Zhao said, he began to chop up the body, overcome by hallucinations: "I heard someone talking to me about a bear and how to cut up a bear," he told the court.
A more than eight-hour standoff ensued, during which the police surrounded the mansion in West Vancouver.
After the killing, lawyers for the Yuan family said Mr. Zhao was a fabulist and motivated by revenge.
But during the trial, Mr. Zhao's lawyer, Ian Donaldson, told the court that his client was a "normal, healthy" person who had been subject to "provocation."
The prosecutor countered that it was irrefutable that Mr. Zhao had killed Mr. Yuan. She also argued that his testimony that the killing was an accident was neither credible nor reliable.
After the case gained exposure in the news media, seven women from China claimed that their children deserved part of Mr. Yuan's roughly $ 21 million Canadian estate.
A judge ruled that five were entitled to split Mr. Yuan's possessions. However, a taxidermied black panther, displayed at the entrance of one of his mansions, was donated to a museum.

Texto completo: Imaad Zuberi was said by federal prosecutors in New York to have deleted emails and backdated a check to hide the sources of money he donated.
WASHINGTON -- A California venture capitalist who was a major donor mostly to Democrats before abruptly shifting the bulk of his giving to Republicans after the 2016 election was charged on Tuesday by prosecutors in New York with obstructing a federal investigation into donations to President Trump's inaugural committee.
The donor, Imaad Zuberi, had pleaded guilty last year to separate charges brought by federal prosecutors in Los Angeles related to earlier campaign donations, as well as lobbying and tax violations.
He is expected to plead guilty to the obstruction charge as well, according to two people familiar with the situation. They said prosecutors had moved to consolidate the two cases, for which he was expected to be sentenced in California.
The obstruction charge stemmed from a federal investigation into the source of the $ 900,000 Mr. Zuberi donated through his company, Avenue Ventures, to Mr. Trump's inaugural committee in late December 2016, in what he has acknowledged was an effort to gain access to the incoming administration.
In a court filing on Tuesday, prosecutors said some of the funds Mr. Zuberi donated to the inaugural committee came from other people, including an unnamed American man who wrote a $ 50,000 check to Avenue Ventures to secure "exclusive access to certain inaugural events" promised by Mr. Zuberi.
The man, who is not identified in the filing, did not attend the inauguration, and asked Mr. Zuberi to refund the $ 50,000, according to the prosecutors from the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York. They said in the filing that Mr. Zuberi initially declined to refund the money. He relented, they said, only after The New York Times and other news media outlets reported in early February 2019 that Mr. Zuberi's name and that of his company were included on a subpoena for documents sent to Mr. Trump's inaugural committee as part of a wide-ranging investigation into the inauguration and its financing.
At a meeting at a restaurant in California a few weeks after the news broke, Mr. Zuberi asked the man whether he had been contacted by federal investigators, according to the prosecutors. They wrote that Mr. Zuberi wrote a refund check to the man, backdating it to Feb. 1 "to make it appear" that Mr. Zuberi returned the money "before he learned of the S.D.N.Y. investigation into the source of funds for the $ 900,000" donation.
The prosecutors also accused Mr. Zuberi of deleting emails with individuals who provided money to him around the time of his $ 900,000 donation, including a foreign citizen. The foreigner, who is not named in the court filing, transferred approximately $ 5.8 million to the account Mr. Zuberi used to fund his $ 900,000 inaugural donation, the prosecutors said.
When prosecutors confronted Mr. Zuberi's lawyers about his efforts to delete emails with the foreigner, Mr. Zuberi contacted his email service provider seeking advice on "how to ensure that copies of his emails were not stored on a server," according to the filing.
While federal election laws bar foreign donations and so-called straw donations under someone else's name, Mr. Zuberi was not charged with either offense on Tuesday. Rather, he was charged with obstruction of justice for destroying evidence and backdating the $ 50,000 refund check.
David Kelley, a lawyer for Mr. Zuberi who is handling the case in New York, said the expected guilty plea to the single count of obstruction would conclude the investigation of his conduct in connection with the inauguration.
"This brings closure to the inaugural committee investigation as it relates to Mr. Zuberi," Mr. Kelley said.
The charges to which Mr. Zuberi pleaded guilty last year related to nearly $ 1 million in illegal campaign donations from April 2012 through October 2016, including some funded by foreign sources, as part of a scheme to gain access to American politicians for foreign clients.
He was also charged with falsifying records filed with the Justice Department under the Foreign Agents Registration Act to conceal his lobbying work on behalf of Sri Lanka to help burnish the country's reputation in Washington amid human rights concerns. And he was charged with failing to report and pay taxes on $ 5.65 million he was paid for the Sri Lankan lobbying campaign, much of which, prosecutors say, he diverted for personal use.
Mr. Zuberi could have faced a maximum sentence of 15 years in federal prison for those charges. He is free on bail in that case. He was traveling in Asia on Tuesday, according to someone with knowledge of his whereabouts, and did not respond to a request for comment.

Stretching the Truth About Aid for Ukraine

Texto completo: The president also made inaccurate claims on Tuesday about ISIS fighters and his record on the Iraq war.
"By the way, in terms of the money, it got there two or three weeks ahead of schedule, long before it was supposed to be there."
False. President Trump was wrong in asserting that his decision last year to suspend military assistance to Ukraine -- a key component in his impeachment and upcoming trial -- did not interfere with the schedule for delivering the aid.
The 2019 federal fiscal year ended on Sept. 30, the date by which all appropriated aid to Ukraine was supposed to be disbursed. But because of the freeze ordered by Mr. Trump, not all of the aid was spent before the deadline.
Congress had appropriated $ 391 million in military assistance to Ukraine -- $ 250 million from the Pentagon and $ 141 million from the State Department -- meant to be spent by the end of September. Though the Pentagon announced its plans to provide the aid in June, White House officials blocked its release in July. It remained frozen until mid-September, when Mr. Trump relented after pressure from lawmakers and administration officials.
With just two weeks left in the fiscal year, the Pentagon was unable to fully disburse the funds. According to testimony from Mark Sandy, an official in the Office of Management and Budget, about $ 35 million was left unspent. Congress then extended the deadline to the 2020 fiscal year to allow for the disbursement of the remaining aid.
"Had that provision not been included, then any unobligated funds as of Sept. 30 would have expired," Mr. Sandy said.
"We have thousands of ISIS prisoners that we're keeping right now under lock and key. And we want Europe to take many of these prisoners because they came from Germany, France and other places -- probably a few from Greece, in all fairness."
This is exaggerated. Estimates from Mr. Trump's own administration show that he is overstating the share of Islamic State fighters who hail from Europe.
James F. Jeffrey, the State Department's special envoy for Syria, said in August that about 8,000 ISIS fighters from Syria and Iraq and another 2,000 foreign fighters were being detained by the Syrian Democratic Forces, the loose coalition of militias fighting the terrorist group.
Of those foreign fighters, about 800 are European and the rest are from former Soviet republics, the Middle East, North Africa and Asia, according to a Pentagon inspector general report from August. The report and other analysts have noted that many of those places are hesitant to repatriate their citizens, fearing political backlash or hurdles in prosecution.
As for Mr. Trump's contention that a "few" ISIS fighters are Greek nationals, the nonprofit Counter Extremism Project concluded that the number was "not well documented" but said that Greece had been used as a transit point for fighters of European origin. A July report from the London-based International Center for the Study of Radicalization estimated that women and children affiliated with the Islamic State numbered about 6,600 from Western Europe but none from Greece.
Mr. Trump previously received pushback from the French president, Emmanuel Macron, when he told Mr. Macron in December that "many" fighters come from France.
"Let's be serious," Mr. Macron said accurately. "The very large numbers of fighters on the ground are the fighters coming from Syria, from Iraq."
Mr. Trump also revived claims that The New York Times has previously fact-checked, including his often repeated falsehood that he opposed the Iraq war "in the first place" (he did not) and his exaggerated contention that European countries are not contributing assistance to Ukraine (they do).

Texto completo: Readers discuss the former national security adviser's change of heart and whether he might actually defend the president.
To the Editor:
Re "Bolton, in Twist, Offers to Testify at Trump's Trial" (front page, Jan. 7):
Is it a coincidence that John Bolton, immediately after the assassination of Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, agreed to testify in the impeachment trial? It is reported that such testimony would be damning to the president, but is that necessarily so?
As we all know, Mr. Bolton has long advocated military action against Iran. Now that President Trump has initiated a direct attack, isn't it more likely that Mr. Bolton would make every effort to defend him against removal?
Lawrence Kaplan
Ardsley, N.Y.
To the Editor:
Now that John Bolton, the former national security adviser, has announced that he will testify if subpoenaed by the Senate in its impeachment proceedings, it is up to Mitch McConnell to subpoena him. If Mr. McConnell decides he does not wish to hear what Mr. Bolton has to say, perhaps Mr. Bolton would agree to appear before the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee in a "Phase 2" of its impeachment inquiry?

Texto completo: A model presented at the Consumer Electronics Show is said to hold the promise of aerial ride sharing at 180 miles an hour.
Curtiss Autoplane. Fulton Airphibian. Taylor Aerocar.
Businesses and entrepreneurs have been promising a mass-produced flying car for more than a century. None have succeeded, but that hasn't stopped Hyundai and Uber from wanting in on the action.
In Las Vegas on Monday, at the Consumer Electronics Show, the two companies announced that they were joining forces to develop an all-electric air taxi that would be part of a future "aerial ride-share network."
"We're looking at the dawn of a completely new era that opens the skies above our cities," Jaiwon Shin, the head of Hyundai's Urban Air Mobility division, said at the announcement. "We will be able to fly on demand -- just imagine that."
The South Korean automaker showed a small-scale model on Monday and offered a virtual-reality experience. A nonfunctioning full-scale model was later on display.
The public has long been disappointed by promises of flying cars, but hopes have nevertheless been mounting that an aerial taxi could become a reality.
Analysts with Morgan Stanley have said they expect urban air taxis to be common by 2040, with the global market expected to be between $ 1.4 trillion and $ 2.9 trillion in size by then. At least 20 companies are working to that end, including start-ups, the aircraft manufacturers Boeing and Airbus, and automakers like Toyota and Porsche.
Daniel Wiegand, a founder of Lilium, one of the most promising and secretive start-ups in the field, told The New York Times recently that within five years a fleet of his company's vehicles could be ferrying passengers between Manhattan and Kennedy International Airport.
But a number of challenges await. Building an air taxi that is quiet, safe and economical will mean overcoming several engineering and technical hurdles. Battery technology is limited, and the cost of operation and maintenance needs to be low enough to make rides commercially viable.
And then there is a long road to regulatory approval. According to Morgan Stanley, air taxis will probably be used first in package delivery, which has fewer technical and regulatory barriers.
In its Monday announcement, Hyundai said it would be able to bring "automotive-scale manufacturing" to Uber Elevate, the company's aerial ride-hailing division. Hyundai would help produce and deploy the aircraft while Uber would handle support, ground connections and the customer interface.
Hyundai's concept car, the S-A1, is designed to cruise 1,000 to 2,000 feet above the ground at 180 miles per hour. It would take trips up to 60 miles and seat four passengers and a pilot, though the aircraft would eventually be capable of autonomous flight.
During peak hours, the S-A1 would take about five to seven minutes to recharge, Hyundai said. Multiple rotors would allow for vertical takeoff and landing and be quieter than large-rotor helicopters with combustion engines -- a feature critical to its use in cities, according to the company.
Uber has said it plans to host flight demonstrations this year and make its service commercially available in 2023. In addition to Hyundai, its partners include the Boeing subsidiary Aurora Flight Sciences, Bell, Embraer, Joby Aviation and several real estate companies. It has also signed agreements with National Aeronautics and Space Administration to develop ideas related to the infrastructure and technology of a crewless aerial network.

Facebook Will Ban 'Deepfakes'

Texto completo: The company said it would remove videos altered by artificial intelligence in ways meant to mislead viewers.
WASHINGTON -- Facebook says it will ban videos that are heavily manipulated by artificial intelligence, the latest in a string of changes by the company to combat the flow of false information on its site.
A company executive said in a blog post late Monday that the social network would remove videos, often called deepfakes, that artificial intelligence has altered in ways that "would likely mislead someone into thinking that a subject of the video said words that they did not actually say." The videos will also be banned in ads.
The policy will have a limited effect on slowing the spread of false videos, since the vast majority are edited in more traditional ways: cutting out context or changing the order of words. The policy will not extend to those videos, or to parody or satire, said the executive, Monika Bickert.
Ms. Bickert said all videos posted would still be subject to Facebook's system for fact-checking potentially deceptive content. Content that is found to be factually incorrect appears less prominently on the site's news feed and is labeled false.
But the announcement underscores how Facebook, by far the world's largest social network, is trying to thwart one of the latest tricks used by purveyors of disinformation ahead of this year's presidential election. False information spread furiously on the platform during the 2016 campaign, leading to widespread criticism of the company.
By banning deepfakes before the technology becomes widespread, Facebook is trying to calm lawmakers, academics and political campaigns who remain frustrated by how the company handles political posts and videos about politics and politicians.
But some Democratic politicians said the new policy did not go nearly far enough. Last year, Facebook refused to take down a video that was edited to make it appear that Speaker Nancy Pelosi was slurring her words. At the time, the company defended its decision despite furious criticism, saying that it had subjected the video to its fact-checking process and had reduced its reach on the social network.
The new policy, though, does not apply to the video of Ms. Pelosi. Disinformation researchers have referred to similar videos as "cheapfakes" or "shallowfakes," or deceptive content edited with simple video-editing software, in contrast to the more sophisticated deepfake videos generated by artificial intelligence.
Ms. Pelosi's deputy chief of staff, Drew Hammill, said in a statement that Facebook "wants you to think the problem is video-editing technology, but the real problem is Facebook's refusal to stop the spread of disinformation."
Facebook would also keep up a video, widely circulated last week, in which a long response that former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. gave to a voter in New Hampshire was heavily edited to wrongly suggest that he made racist remarks.
Bill Russo, deputy communications director of Mr. Biden's presidential campaign, said Facebook's new policy was not meant "to fix the very real problem of disinformation that is undermining faith in our electoral process, but is instead an illusion of progress."
"Banning deepfakes should be an incredibly low floor in combating disinformation," Mr. Russo said.
The company's new policy was first reported by The Washington Post.
Computer scientists have long warned that new techniques used by machines to generate images and sounds that are indistinguishable from the real thing can vastly increase the volume of false and misleading information online.
Deepfakes have become much more prevalent in recent months, especially on social media. And they have already begun challenging the public's assumptions about what is real and what is not.
Last year, for instance, a Facebook video released by the government of Gabon, a country in central Africa, was meant to show proof of life for its president, who was out of the country for medical care. But the president's critics claimed it was fake.
In December 2017, the technology site Motherboard reported that people were using A.I. technology to graft the heads of celebrities onto nude bodies in pornographic videos. Websites like Pornhub, Twitter and Reddit suppressed the videos, but according to the research firm Deeptrace Labs, these videos still made up 96 percent of deepfakes found in the last year.
Tech companies are researching new techniques to detect deepfake videos and stop their spread on social media, even as the technology to create them quickly evolves. Last year, Facebook participated in a "Deepfake Detection Challenge" and, along with other tech firms like Google and Microsoft, offered a bounty for outside researchers who develop the best tools and techniques to identify A.I.-generated deepfake videos.
Because Facebook is the No. 1 platform for sharing false political stories, according to disinformation researchers, it has an added urgency to spot and halt novel forms of digital manipulation. Renée DiResta, the technical research manager for the Stanford Internet Observatory, which studies disinformation, pointed out that a challenge of the policy was that the deepfake content "is likely to have already gone viral prior to any takedown or fact check."
On Wednesday, Ms. Bickert, Facebook's vice president of global policy management, is expected join other experts to testify on "manipulation and deception in the digital age" before the House Energy and Commerce Committee.
Ms. DiResta urged lawmakers to "delve into the specifics around how quickly the company envisions it could detect or respond to a viral deepfake, or to the 'shallowfakes' material which it won't take down but has committed to fact-checking."
Subbarao Kambhampati, a professor of computer science at Arizona State University, described Facebook's effort to detect deepfakes as "a moving target." He said that Facebook's automated systems for detecting such videos would have limited reach, and that there would be "significant incentive" for people to develop fakes that fool Facebook's systems.
There are many ways to manipulate videos with the help of artificial intelligence, added Matthias Niessner, a professor of computer science at the Technical University of Munich, who works with Google on its deepfake research. There are deepfake videos in which faces are swapped, for instance, or in which a person's expression and lip movement are altered, he said.
"The question is where you draw the line," Mr. Niessner said. "Eventually, it raises the question of intent and semantics."

Texto completo: Readers react to an Op-Ed article by the novelist Richard Flanagan that faults the country's politicians, among other things.
To the Editor:
Re "Australia Is Committing Climate Suicide," by Richard Flanagan (Op-Ed, Jan. 4):
Heartbroken and desperate Australians want Prime Minister Scott Morrison to stop trying to repair his damaged image by having photo shoots with shattered victims and giving platitudes when we need leadership and action.
Mr. Flanagan is correct that our country is deeply affected by climate change, resulting in widespread drought and catastrophic bush fires through large swaths of the country. The Great Barrier Reef and our kelp forests, which extend across the bottom of Australia, are dying because of ocean warming, acidification and cattle station runoff.
We have lost thousands of our native animals and birds, farmed animals and pets. Loss of human lives and homes is mounting daily.
Mr. Flanagan's suggestion is correct: Australia is looking very much like the "Chernobyl of climate crisis," and summer has just begun. Actions against climate change are urgent in Australia and worldwide.

To the Editor:
We woke recently to heavy smoke in the air. We live in Stanley, a small village in the Victorian High Country, a three-hour drive north of Melbourne. The fire authorities were suggesting that the three bush fires could join to form a mega-fire. We made the decision to evacuate. We loaded the car and joined the thousands of other Australians across the country who were evacuating their homes in regional areas.
Richard Flanagan's article was compelling reading and succinctly reflected the appalling leadership void the Australian community is facing.
For many Australians, it seems as if we've entered some sort of "Back to the Future" parallel universe and somehow Biff is in charge.
Robert Craig
Stanley, Australia
To the Editor:
Suicide is an individual action. Richard Flanagan seems to believe that Australia has some significant control over atmospheric carbon dioxide, and that by government action, wildfires and changes to the Great Barrier Reef potentially associated with climate change can somehow be mitigated.
Australia is a country with under 25 million people. If all Australians stopped use of fossil fuels entirely, there would be no significant effect on any environmental consequence of carbon emission. Countries buying Australian coal and gas would get it somewhere else.
Addressing the effects of fossil fuel combustion on climate is a global challenge that requires global participation. The most important contribution Australia can make to carbon dioxide emission reduction is to spearhead efforts to accelerate deployment of nuclear power in Western democracies, making use of their abundant uranium and thorium reserves.
This would give competition to Russia's efforts to dominate the world's nuclear power industry and provide long-term opportunities for export and high-value jobs for Australians.

Texto completo: Several celebrities were among those who might be mentioned or might testify at the rape trial of Harvey Weinstein, a judge said.
The actresses Salma Hayek, Rosie Perez and Charlize Theron were among the people that a judge said on Tuesday might be called as witnesses or mentioned in testimony during the rape trial of the movie producer Harvey Weinstein.
The actresses' names appeared on lists of possible witnesses provided to the judge as jury selection started in State Supreme Court in Manhattan. The lists provided a rough cast of characters for the trial and also included several of Mr. Weinstein's business partners and employees, among them his brother, Robert Weinstein.
It remained unclear how many of the people on the lists would be called as witnesses at trial or would simply be named in testimony. Six women are expected to testify about their allegations that Mr. Weinstein sexually assaulted them, but only two have been identified by the prosecution.
The names of the 90 potential witnesses became public as it became clear how hard it would be to find an impartial jury. A third of the 120 potential jurors on Tuesday asked to be excused, saying they could not be fair. Those who told the judge they had their minds made up about Mr. Weinstein varied in age and ethnicity. Twenty-four were women.
The trial of Mr. Weinstein, 67, is one of the most anticipated proceedings in recent years. Allegations against him helped ignite the global #MeToo movement, a reckoning over sexual assault and harassment by powerful and influential men in the workplace.
First two days of proceedings have had moments of drama. Before jury selection began, the judge overseeing the trial, James M. Burke, issued a sharp rebuke to Mr. Weinstein, threatening to jail him for using two cellphones in the courtroom despite previous warnings to put the devices away.
"What did I say would happen if he so much has a cellphone or electronic device since there have been repeated violations of this, including some on the record?" Justice Burke said as he took the bench.
One of Mr. Weinstein's lawyers, Arthur Aidala, appeared taken aback: "You said you never want to see a cellphone in my client's hand."
The judge then reminded Mr. Weinstein that his bail would be revoked and that he would be jailed during his trial if he did not stop using his telephone. "Is this really how you want to end up in jail for the rest of your life, by texting and violating a court order?" the judge said.
Minutes later, prosecutors asked for Mr. Weinstein to be held in jail without bail in light of rape and sexual assault charges that were filed in Los Angeles on Monday. The judge rejected the request.
Twelve jurors and six alternates will ultimately decide Mr. Weinstein's fate in New York. Opening arguments in the case are expected to start on Jan. 22, with the trial concluding by March 6.
Prosecutors charge that Mr. Weinstein raped one woman, who has not been identified in court documents, at a Midtown hotel in March 2013 and forced oral sex on a second woman, Mimi Haleyi, a production assistant, at his apartment in Manhattan in 2006. He also faces a charge of predatory sexual assault for allegedly having committed a serious sex crime against more than one person.
Mr. Weinstein maintains that his sexual encounters with the women were consensual.
Mr. Aidala said the charges announced in Los Angeles would make it challenging to find impartial jurors in New York. Prosecutors in California accused Mr. Weinstein of raping one woman and sexually assaulting another over two days in February 2013.
"For a prosecutor, this is Christmas morning, more prejudice against the defendant you're trying to prosecute," Mr. Aidala said. "And to say there was no coordination -- it's very hard your honor -- to believe that was an absolute coincidence."
On Tuesday afternoon, 36 of the potential jurors who told the court they could be fair to Mr. Weinstein were told to complete a 16-page questionnaire. They were asked, among other things, if they had heard about the case in the media, and if that information would affect their ability to be fair and impartial.
The people were also asked if they or someone they know had ever been the victim of physical or sexual assault.
During the selection process, Justice Burke read aloud the names of people whom the prosecution and defense said they might call as witnesses or mention in testimony.
The names included some of Mr. Weinstein's accusers, like Ms. Haleyi, who will testify, but others had no known connection to the allegations at the heart the case. Ms. Theron, for instance, recently said Mr. Weinstein had spread rumors about them having sex, but has not accused him of other wrongdoing. Ms. Hayek wrote an essay in 2018 that accused him of sexual harassment without providing details. She called Mr. Weinstein "my monster."
The lists also included Annabella Sciorra, the actress known for her work in "The Sopranos," and her friend, Ms. Perez. The prosecution has said it plans to call Ms. Sciorra to testify about her allegation that Mr. Weinstein sexually assaulted her in 1993 in her Gramercy Park apartment. Ms. Sciorra later told Ms. Perez about the alleged incident, making her a possible witness, according to The New Yorker.
Spokespeople for Ms. Hayek, Ms. Perez and Ms. Theron did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Mr. Weinstein's brother, Robert, who has acknowledged he was aware of allegations of sexual misconduct against the producer for years, was also named.
The prosecution listed several of Mr. Weinstein's former business associates, who have said in recent years that they were concerned about his behavior. The jury may hear, for instance, from Irwin Reiter, Mr. Weinstein's corporate accountant of 30 years, who has said he became so troubled by the producer's conduct that he supplied records to The New York Times about allegations of misconduct.
A former member of the Weinstein Company board, Lance Maerov, was also mentioned. He has said he was troubled by accusations against Mr. Weinstein in 2014 and 2015.
The defense lawyers had submitted a list of possible witnesses that included the lead detective who worked on the case, Nicholas DiGaudio, who has been accused of misconduct, as well current and former Manhattan prosecutors.

Texto completo: Michael R. Bloomberg's presidential campaign has secured 60 seconds' worth of advertising during the game on Feb. 2. President Trump's re-election campaign announced it had done the same.
Michael R. Bloomberg's presidential campaign has secured a 60-second advertising spot to air nationally during next month's Super Bowl telecast, an ad buy that will most likely cost at least $ 10 million.
Hours after The New York Times reported Mr. Bloomberg's plans, President Trump's re-election campaign said that it, too, had reserved 60 seconds' worth of advertising during the game for roughly $ 10 million.
The dueling ads on the year's biggest night of television are evidence that the two New York billionaires are preparing for a schoolyard brawl on the national airwaves over the coming months, with each increasingly willing to dip into his vast resources -- Mr. Bloomberg is spending his own fortune, and Mr. Trump has a nine-figure campaign war chest -- to broadcast their messages.
"The biggest point is getting under Trump's skin," said Michael Frazier, a spokesman for the Bloomberg campaign. By "taking the fight to Trump," Mr. Frazier said, "the ad is part of Mike's strategy of running a national campaign that focuses on states where the general election will be decided, parts of the country that are often overlooked."
Aides to Mr. Bloomberg, who is running for the Democratic presidential nomination, said his Super Bowl ad would be a new spot that has not yet aired. They would not specify the cost of the ad, but executives at Fox, which is broadcasting the game on Feb. 2, have said they were seeking "north of $ 5 million" per 30-second spot.
The Trump campaign's decision to advertise during the Super Bowl, which was first reported by Politico, continues a strategy of advertising during major sporting events.
"President Trump made the unprecedented decision to keep the campaign open following his first election, which allows us to do things like buying a Super Bowl ad," said Tim Murtaugh, a spokesman for the Trump campaign. "We got in early, which gave us prime ad position early in the game."
It was not clear when during the game Mr. Bloomberg's ad would air. The Super Bowl is regularly the most watched single television program in any given year; last year's game drew 98.2 million viewers on CBS.
Mr. Bloomberg's campaign has continued to set records for political advertising by a presidential candidate, having already spent nearly $ 170 million on television and digital advertising, according to Advertising Analytics, an ad tracking firm. Mr. Bloomberg, a billionaire media owner and former mayor of New York, is funding his campaign with his own money and is not soliciting donations.
"We have the means to raise a national campaign unlike any other candidate," Mr. Frazier said.
Mr. Bloomberg has made targeting Mr. Trump a core element of his ad strategy. Before he announced his candidacy, he pledged to spend $ 100 million on ads criticizing the president. And since he began his bid, his campaign has unloaded a barrage of Facebook attack ads in general-election swing states, seeking to erode support for Mr. Trump by highlighting what Mr. Bloomberg calls his broken promises on infrastructure, health care and solving dysfunction in Washington.
Super Bowl ads are rarely seen in presidential politics. Though some campaigns have made local advertising buys during past Super Bowls, a national buy has often been out of reach, given the expense. It is also usually viewed as wasteful to pay to reach a 50-state audience rather than buying ads in key states where campaigns would prefer to target their message.
But Mr. Bloomberg is running an unconventional primary campaign with a heavy national emphasis, choosing to avoid the four states that hold the first caucuses and primaries in February and instead focusing his efforts on Super Tuesday on March 3, when 14 states will vote.
"It's actually smart for Bloomberg," said Ken Goldstein, a professor of politics at the University of San Francisco. "Bloomberg is running a national campaign, and the most efficient way to reach a lot of people in a national campaign is buying an ad in a top-rated show. And as expensive as it is, it's cheaper than buying the ads market by market."
Mr. Trump's campaign also has deep pockets. It said last week that it had raised $ 46 million in the last three months of 2019 and was entering 2020 with $ 102.7 million in cash on hand.
The Super Bowl ads will air at a politically potent time: The Iowa caucuses are the day after the game (though Mr. Bloomberg has said he is not competing in them), and Mr. Trump is scheduled to deliver his State of the Union address the night after that.
The Super Bowl broadcast has often avoided the rancor of national politics. Perhaps the most recent national advertisement that waded into political territory was a 30-second ad featuring Tim Tebow, then a recent college football star, talking about his anti-abortion views, which aired during the 2010 matchup between the New Orleans Saints and Indianapolis Colts.
Presidential campaigns have advertised during major sporting events before, however. In October, the Trump campaign made a seven-figure ad buy during Game 7 of the World Series, pushing back on the impeachment inquiry in Washington. And in 2016, with just over a week to go before Election Day, Mr. Trump's and Hillary Clinton's campaigns each purchased multiple ads during Game 7 of that year's World Series.

F.B.I. Asks Apple To Open Phones Gunman Owned

Texto completo: The request could reignite a fight between the Silicon Valley giant and law enforcement over access to encrypted technology.
SAN FRANCISCO -- The encryption debate between Apple and the F.B.I. might have found its new test case.
The F.B.I. said on Tuesday that it had asked Apple for the data on two iPhones that belonged to the gunman in the shooting last month at a naval base in Pensacola, Fla., possibly setting up another showdown over law enforcement's access to smartphones.
Dana Boente, the F.B.I.'s general counsel, said in a letter to Apple that federal investigators could not gain access to the iPhones because they were locked and encrypted and their owner, Second Lt. Mohammed Saeed Alshamrani of the Saudi Royal Air Force, is dead. Two people who had seen the letter described it to The New York Times on the condition of anonymity because the government's investigation into the shooting is still active.
The F.B.I. has a search warrant for the devices and is seeking Apple's assistance executing it, the people said.
Lieutenant Alshamrani is the Saudi Air Force trainee who federal authorities believe shot and killed three sailors at Naval Air Station Pensacola in December.
The case could become a new point of contention in a long-running dispute between Apple and the F.B.I. over what digital information should be accessible to law enforcement. In 2014, Apple started building encryption into iPhones that can be unlocked only with a given device's password, meaning even Apple cannot bypass the security. The technology has frustrated law enforcement authorities, who say Apple has given criminals a safe haven.
Apple said in a statement that it had given the F.B.I. all the data "in our possession" related to the Pensacola case when it was asked a month ago. "We will continue to support them with the data we have available," the company said. Apple regularly complies with court orders to turn over information it has on its servers, such as iCloud data, but it has long argued that it does not have access to material stored only on a locked, encrypted iPhone.
An F.B.I. spokeswoman confirmed the existence of the letter, which was first reported by NBC News, but declined to comment further.
Before sending the letter, the F.B.I. checked with other government agencies and its national security allies to see if they had a way into the devices -- but they did not, according to one of the people familiar with the investigation.
The official said the F.B.I. was not asking Apple to create a so-called backdoor or technological solution to get past its encryption that must be shared with the government. Instead, the government is seeking the data that is on the two phones, the official said.
Apple has argued in the past that obtaining such data would require it to build a backdoor, which it said would set a dangerous precedent for user privacy and cybersecurity.
The Pensacola case resembles the 2016 dispute between Apple and the F.B.I. over the iPhone of the man who, along with his wife, shot and killed 14 people in San Bernardino, Calif. As in that case, there is a dead gunman, a court authorization to gain entry to a phone, and an early stalemate between law enforcement and Apple.
But the San Bernardino investigation turned into a high-stakes showdown after a federal judge ordered Apple to help the authorities gain entry to the phone. Such a court order has not been issued in the Pensacola case, and it is does not appear that the F.B.I. has yet sought such a ruling.
The letter could be the first step toward such an order, as the F.B.I. would likely need to show a judge that Apple had refused to assist in executing a warrant. Apple did not respond to a question about whether it would comply with the F.B.I.'s request in the Pensacola investigation.
After the federal judge ordered Apple to create a way to open the San Bernardino gunman's phone in 2016, Tim Cook, Apple's chief executive, responded with a 1,100-word letter in which he said that creating such a backdoor would compromise the security of every iPhone.
"The government suggests this tool could only be used once, on one phone," he said. "But that's simply not true. Once created, the technique could be used over and over again, on any number of devices."
Mr. Cook made an aggressive argument to the public that the Obama administration's actions would undermine people's privacy and security. But he may find it more difficult to attack the Trump administration, which has long dangled the threat of tariffs on Apple's products.
Mr. Cook has become an ally of President Trump, visiting him regularly in Washington and recently hosting him at a Mac computer factory in Texas, where the president claimed he had helped spur its construction when it had actually been open for six years.
The dispute over the San Bernardino case was resolved when the F.B.I. found a private company that was able to bypass the iPhone's encryption. The Justice Department's Office of Inspector General later found that the F.B.I. had not exhausted all possible solutions to unlock the phone before it tried to force Apple to build a way past the encryption.
Both sides have since doubled down on their stances. Apple has made its encryption even tougher, closing gaps that law enforcement had exploited to gain entry to iPhones.
And Attorney General William P. Barr has recently turned up his criticism of encryption. He said last month that finding a way for law enforcement to gain access to encrypted technology was one of the Justice Department's "highest priorities."
In several speeches last year, he noted that drug cartels, human trafficking rings and child pornographers depended on consumer products with strong encryption, such as WhatsApp and Signal, and he has singled out Facebook's efforts to wrap all of its products in virtually unbreakable encryption as a scourge for law enforcement.
"We're talking about when you have a warrant and probable cause and you cannot get the information," Mr. Barr said at a Wall Street Journal conference in Washington last month.
Companies like Facebook are selling the idea that "no matter what you do, you're completely impervious to government surveillance," Mr. Barr said. "Do we want to live in a society like that? I don't think we do."

Texto completo: Gabrielle Canon here, filling in for Arlene Martinez for the next couple days on the In California newsletter. PSA: Like this news? You can sign up here to make sure you get the latest. Now, onto the news.
We have officially been in 2020 for a week and it's clear the holidays are over. Doubt it? Tuesday's headlines include news that Californians continue to flee high prices, Iranian Americans in L. A. are grappling with the escalating tensions with the U. S. , and someone may have stolen a bunch of llamas in Riverside County.
But first, a moment of silence for Mandalorian, a 1-year-old sea lion who had to be euthanized after rescuers found her with two gunshot wounds. And, she's not alone. The L. A. Times has the heartbreaking story of this troubling trend.
“These are disgusting and intentional acts, many of which are premeditated,” Peter Chang, chief executive of the Pacific Marine Mammal Center in Laguna Beach told The Times. “We know there are many out there that feel like they are competing with the sea lions for the same resources. However, there’s a pathway for us to cohabitate with these precious marine mammals, and shooting them is not the way. ”
And later, a history lesson on the Mexican-American war in Escondido — or at the very least a fun spot to stop if you find yourself near San Diego on Hwy 78.
The new California dream is a ticket out of town
Most Californians have anecdotal evidence that people are leaving the state. They have seen their friend-groups dwindle, or seen U-hauls heading north or east. But now, the flight from unsustainably high costs is showing up in state growth statistics.
According to the U. S. Census Bureau, middle and lower-class Californians are fleeing the state in droves. In a three-month period alone, more than 28,190 left the Bay Area, where the median-priced home costs around $1. 5 million. San Francisco took the top spot in places people are leaving, but across the state, those making less than $100,000 are hitting the road. Still, the state has seen an influx of people making $100,000 and above.
Iranian Americans react to Soleimani's assassination
A large number of Iranian Americans live in Los Angeles and many are now grappling with complicated feelings after President Donald Trump ordered an airstrike that assassinated Iranian Gen. Qasem Soleimani. Some shared that they aren't mourning his death but are concerned about the consequences. Many others were fearful about speaking publicly about it.
"We don't know what's happening, or what's going to happen next," Roxanne Mirzaee told USA Today. More than 25 others declined to talk to reporters, concerned that it could put their family members still living abroad at greater risk, or create divides between families.
While it's unclear what will happen next, hostilities have already escalated. Today, Iran launched more than a dozen ballistic missiles at U. S. military and coalition forces in Iraq, the Pentagon confirmed.
Read this story for their reactions, but if you need background on how we got here, check this explainer.
What else we are reading
California lawmakers are considering a state-level Green New Deal, modeled on the proposal outlined by U. S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez — but perhaps even broader.
Gov. Gavin Newsom has relied heavily on global consulting firm McKinsey & Co. , the Sacramento Bee reports, and that is raising eyebrows.
Berkeley may have been the first city to ban natural gas in newly built homes, but some cities that are following the liberal California bastion's lead are going even further.
A crisis is continuing in California state prisons as a record number of prisoners are committing suicide. For the first time since the state began tracking in 1990, the suicide rate has topped 30 for every 100,000 in 2019.
Also today: Protesters disrupt housing bill press conference
In Oakland, the California city that's seen the steepest rise in homelessness in the past two years — up roughly 47% — and where housing prices continue to skyrocket, protesters crashed a press conference Tuesday to demand more be done. They faced off with state Sen. Scott Wiener, Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf, and other officials speaking at an event to highlight Senate Bill 50, a proposal to increase housing density and allow construction of more mid-rise apartment buildings. This is the third year Wiener has introduced the legislation — it failed twice before — and the new version seeks to appease critics' concerns that it will lead to more gentrification, or take local control away from cities.
For what you need to know about SB 50, here's an excellent explainer from CalMatters.
More #llamadrama: two dozen suspected stolen
After a break-in at an exotic animal farm in Southern California, roughly two dozen llamas may be on the loose. The lock was cut on a fence at the 14-acre farm, Riverside County Sheriff's Department authorities discovered, after deputies received an early morning call about "numerous llamas and emus walking on Orange Avenue," the department said.
The officers were able to wrangle some of them back into confinement, but many of the animals remain unaccounted for — and they are worth $1. 6 million.
An investigation is ongoing. Let's hope these llamas find their way to safety. (And maybe that they are discovered during waking hours so the Internet will be rewarded with another wonderful llama chase).
Californians face long waits for worker's comp
Medical evaluations are typically required when someone injured on the job files for worker's compensation — but in California, there aren't enough physicians serving as experts for the state's program. That means some injured people are forced to wait months or even years to get the help they need.
Part of the issue is pay. The state has not upped the pay schedule for these Qualified Medical Evaluators in over a decade, according to a report from the first-ever state audit of the California Division of Workers' Compensation.
“It’s affecting real workers, and if something is not being done correctly, they need to fix it,” Assemblywoman Blanca Rubio, a Democrat from Baldwin Park, told CalMatters, calling for the department to take it seriously.
I will send you on your way with a fun travel tip from John R. Beyer, who recently found himself near an old battle site from the Mexican-American War while visiting friends in Escondido. One mile east, off Highway 78 past the San Diego Zoo Safari Park, Beyer and his wife encountered the San Pasqual Battlefield State Historic Park, and a "fount of knowledge concerning the history," from a worker named Gil.
"Gil regaled us with tales from every moment of the battle, but he ended up offering a rather poetic take on the war itself," Beyer writes.
“You know, many people don’t talk about the Mexican-American War in school. Certainly not this battle,” he said. “It’s a chapter in both our histories that doesn’t put us in any positive light. It really was a battle of greed and power from both sides of the border. There really were no clear winners — especially here on this battlefield. ”
The 285-acre park includes a sculpture garden called "Queen Califia's Magic Circle" and an afternoon traveling through time, but it is only open on weekends.

Texto completo: In the 1950s and 1960s, many American television viewers wondering about the day's high and low temperatures or the chance of weekend rainfall got their forecasts from 'weathergirls,' women with little if any training in meteorology whose indignities sometimes included the requirement that they don bathing suits before going on air.
There were weathermen and weathergirls, but for generations, female meteorologists were practically unheard of. So, too, were black atmospheric scientists. A trailblazer for both was June Bacon-Bercey, who died July 3 at 90 in Burlingame, Calif. Her death was not widely noted before AccuWeather, the forecasting service, reported it on Jan. 3, describing her as the first female TV meteorologist in the United States.
Beginning in the 1950s, Mrs. Bacon-Bercey worked for the Weather Bureau and its successor agency, the National Weather Service, as well as for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Atomic Energy Commission. At each stop in her career, she overcame obstacles to women and minorities, who had long been largely excluded from the sciences.
But she was perhaps best known for her pathbreaking stint during the early 1970s at a local NBC television affiliate in Buffalo. Trained in meteorology " in the 1950s, she had been among the first women to receive a university degree in the field " she was initially hired as a science correspondent. An opportunity to report the weather arose in 1971 when the station's weather anchor robbed a bank.
'All hell broke loose at the station . . . and they needed someone who was there to fill in for the day,' Mrs. Bacon-Bercey recounted to the San Francisco Chronicle years later. 'I already knew from my calculations there was going to be a heat wave. When the heat wave hit the next day, the job was mine.'
In 1972, according to the book 'Weather on the Air: A History of Broadcast Meteorology' by meteorologist Robert Henson, Mrs. Bacon-Bercey had the double distinction of becoming the first African American and first woman to earn a Seal of Approval from the American Meteorological Society, a designation created to assure television viewers of a weathercaster's qualifications.
Mrs. Bacon-Bercey told Henson in an interview that she had initially been reluctant to accept the weathercasting position, not wishing to perpetuate the sexism of the 'weathergirl' era. (Dianne White Clatto, described by the New York Times in a 2015 obituary as 'the first full-time black television weathercaster in the country,' was among the few African American women to be hired in that role.)
'I did not want to do weather on television, only because at that time I felt it was still gimmickry from women,' Mrs. Bacon-Bercey said, 'and I didn't want to prostitute my profession by being some kind of clown.'
But she was an 'immediate hit,' Henson wrote, and went on for several years reporting heat waves and (perhaps more often) snowstorms for Buffalo television viewers. She became a founding member of the American Meteorological Society's Board on Women and Minorities in 1975.
In 1977, she was a dominant contestant on the game show 'The $128,000 Question,' then hosted by Mike Darow. She collected $64,000 answering questions about the music of composer John Philip Sousa, in whose exuberant marches, she told The Washington Post at the time, she found 'a feeling of confidence' and 'a source of courage, power and trust.'
She used her winnings to start a scholarship through the American Geophysical Union for female students in the field of atmospheric sciences.
'I was discouraged' from becoming a meteorologist, Mrs. Bacon-Bercey told The Post, 'and other women were discouraged. If they feel they've got some money behind them, it might be better.'
Marshall Shepherd, a professor of atmospheric sciences at the University of Georgia and a former president of the American Meteorological Society, said in an interview that 'at a time when women and minorities were fighting for . . . equal rights in general,' Mrs. Bacon-Bercey's achievements in a 'highly scientific, technical field' demonstrate 'just how pioneering and influential she was.'
'I have many friends, African American and women meteorologists, who cite her as an inspiration " as a mentor " for what they do today,' he added.
June Esther Griffin was born on Oct. 23, 1928, in Wichita, where she was raised by an aunt and uncle. Her aunt sold Avon beauty products and established what the Wichita Eagle described as the city's first African American beauty school. Mrs. Bacon-Bercey later said that from a young age, she dreamed of pursuing a career in science.
She began her university studies in Kansas before moving to California, where she became, in 1954, the first African American woman to earn a bachelor's degree in meteorology from the University of California at Los Angeles, according to the school. She received a master of public administration degree from the University of Southern California in 1979.
In 1954, she married Walker J. Bacon Jr., then a dentistry student at Howard University. She settled in the Washington area, working for the Weather Bureau as a weather analyst and forecaster. She later was a radar meteorologist in New York City, according to information provided by her family, before beginning her television work in Buffalo.
In the later years of her decades- long career, Mrs. Bacon-Bercey worked for NOAA in public affairs. 'A woman earning an advanced degree in meteorology wants a career, not a trial balloon that will burst when she begins to push forty,' she once remarked, according to Henson's book.
Her marriages to Bacon, John Bercey and George Brewer ended in divorce. Survivors include two daughters from her first marriage, Dail St. Claire and Dawn-Marie Bacon, both of New York City; and two grandchildren. Dail St. Claire confirmed her mother's death and said the cause was frontotemporal dementia.
Reflecting on her career and on her appetite for challenge, Mrs. Bacon-Bercey told Henson that 'being a black woman, younger than my peers, everything I did I had to excel in, just to be on an even level.'
'I didn't resent that,' she continued. 'I loved it.'

Trump and Bloomberg buy Super Bowl ads

Texto completo: The campaigns of President Trump and billionaire Mike Bloomberg said Tuesday that they have each purchased 60 seconds of ad time during the Super Bowl " pricey gestures underscoring the record spending expected in this year's presidential race.
Bloomberg's campaign said it purchased the ad at market rate, meaning it probably cost at least $10-million. Fox Sports executives have said they are selling 30-second ads for this year's Super Bowl at 'north of $5-million.'
Trump's campaign said it had also spent $10 million, the beginning of a massive ad blitz heading into the election year. Politico first reported the Trump ad buy. Trump has been fundraising for his reelection since 2017, amassing a historically large war chest.
Trump's campaign began discussions with Fox Sports in the fall, and its early start allowed the campaign to book a prime slot early in the game, the campaign said.
'We got in early, which gave us prime ad position early in the game,' said Tim Murtaugh, a Trump campaign spokesman. 'This is a clear indication that we're ramping up the campaign, which also includes unprecedented pushes for black, women, Latino and women voters.'
Neither campaign specified the content of their ads, which will air during the Super Bowl on Feb. 2. Last year's Super Bowl drew nearly 100 million viewers, according to Nielsen ratings.
Bloomberg's purchase is the latest evidence of his ad-driven strategy to carve a path to the Democratic presidential nomination. Bloomberg is self-funding his campaign.
He has already spent at least $100-million on campaign ads since entering the race in late November, spending heavily on ads that target Trump in battleground states and introduce himself and his record to voters in those states and online.
Bloomberg's Super Bowl ad, first reported by the New York Times, will come at a convenient time for the candidate " just a few weeks before Super Tuesday on March 3, when 14 states have Democratic presidential nominating contests.
Bloomberg, who is skipping the first four early-voting states, is flooding airwaves in states that will vote on delegate-heavy Super Tuesday and states voting in early March, in hopes of winning enough delegates to forge a path to the nomination.
'Mike is taking the fight to Trump,' said Michael Frazier, a Bloomberg spokesman.
Trump's campaign has previously bought pricey ad slots as a show of strength " such as running a television ad during Game 7 of the World Series, and a banner video ad on the YouTube homepage on the first day of a Democratic debate earlier this year.
Bloomberg, a former New York mayor, also aired a YouTube banner ad, during the Democratic debate last month, amplifying his message on one of the most expensive and widest-reaching digital advertising slots.

A small voice can make a mighty noise

Texto completo: When a friend emailed Louise Godbold a copy of the New York Times's first article alleging that movie mogul Harvey Weinstein had for decades committed acts of sexual violence, she could hardly believe what she read.
What seemed incredible to Godbold were not the alleged specifics of what the newspaper reported back in October 2017: that ambitious young women were lured into meetings alone with someone who could help their careers; that Weinstein made bizarre requests for massages; that he physically tried to block them from escaping; that he later took steps to keep them silent.
No, it did not shock her that one of the most powerful men in Hollywood would be capable of such things. What did was a sudden realization: I'm not the only one.
All of that, Godbold claims, happened to her back in the early 1990s, when she was a young commercial producer.
A tour of Weinstein's offices ended in an empty room, she says, where he cornered her and put her hand on his crotch. He later apologized through a mutual acquaintance for what he said was 'a misunderstanding.' Weinstein invited her for another meeting a month later, this time in his hotel suite. Godbold says she found him naked and he demanded a massage.
She got out of his suite, and tried to put it all behind her. Decades later, amid the initial round of accusations against Weinstein, she agonized over whether to say anything, and decided to relate some details of her own experience in a blog post.
'I figured that I was writing a footnote to the whole story,' she said. Instead, Godbold was bombarded with interview requests. So it was that she joined more than 80 women who stepped forward. Their voices " some of them famous but most of them not " helped launch the #MeToo movement.
Now comes another turning point: Proceedings began on Monday for Weinstein's trial in New York on charges of rape and sexual assault. Just hours after 67-year-old Weinstein shuffled into that courtroom hunched over a walker, the result of recent back surgery, prosecutors in Los Angeles charged him with four more counts of rape and sexual battery. That means there will be a second trial when this one is over.
All of this will be a test of the justice system and a signal of what others can expect if they call out sexual misconduct.
But for Godbold and the rest of the women who have accused the producer, the coming months also represent a trial of their own resilience. Weinstein has pleaded not guilty and insists his actions were consensual. He and his lawyers portray Weinstein as the true victim.
'I feel like the forgotten man,' Weinstein whined during an interview last month with the New York Post. 'I made more movies directed by women and about women than any filmmaker, and I'm talking about 30 years ago. I'm not talking about now when it's vogue, I did it first. I pioneered it.'
Godbold's encounters with Weinstein added to her disillusionment with the film industry. When someone invited her to help out at a homeless mission in downtown Los Angeles' Skid Row, she found a satisfaction she had not known before. 'After the ephemera of the entertainment world, it felt so good to actually be needed and to actually do some good,' she told me.
Ultimately, she grew fascinated with the burgeoning scientific research around trauma, what it does to a victim's brain and what people must do to reclaim their lives in the wake of shattering events. When the allegations against Weinstein came out, Godbold was working as the executive director of Echo, a nonprofit organization that runs education programs for trauma victims, conferences for professionals who treat them and services such as nonviolent parenting classes.
So it was more than a little ironic, she realized, that she had never come to terms with her own trauma. Godbold, now 57, had blamed herself for what happened. She thought Weinstein's alleged behavior was perhaps an aberration on his part, a misread of signals that she didn't know she was sending.
On Monday, she was one of the self-proclaimed 'silence breakers' who gathered outside the Manhattan courthouse where his trial will take place. 'The truth will prevail. And whether it is this trial or in the future, Harvey will be held accountable for his actions,' declared actress Rosanna Arquette, one of the more recognizable among them.
But if that happens, it will not be because of a few famous names. It will be because of the sheer number of accusers he faces. The women who discovered they weren't the only ones.
When Godbold's turn came, she stepped to the microphone and said: 'My name is Louise Godbold, and you're probably saying " who? Because I'm just a little person.' As she and the others are showing us, even small voices can make a mighty noise, once they find each other and join together.

'Prozac Nation' author spurred memoir boom

Texto completo: Elizabeth Wurtzel, who chronicled her struggles with depression and drug addiction in best-selling memoirs that helped spur a boom in confessional writing, turning her into a Gen X touchstone at 27 with the publication of 'Prozac Nation,' died Jan. 7 at a hospital in Manhattan. She was 52.
Ms. Wurtzel announced in 2015 that she had breast cancer, a challenge that she dismissed as 'nothing' compared with stemming her drug use or overcoming the death of her rescue dog Augusta. She underwent a double mastectomy, but the breast cancer recently metastasized to her brain, said her husband, Jim Freed. The immediate cause of death was complications from leptomeningeal disease, which occurs when cancer spreads to the cerebrospinal fluid.
Writing with extreme candor, Ms. Wurtzel was one of several authors who helped reinvigorate the personal memoir in the 1990s. The form had long been dominated by politicians, artists or entertainers " celebrities and other boldfaced names. Ms. Wurtzel was instead a self-described '20-nothing,' largely unknown outside circles who read her rock criticism in publications such as the New Yorker and New York magazine.
Her harrowing debut, 'Prozac Nation: Young and Depressed in America' (1994), established her as one of the most provocative writers of her generation, generating awe among readers who saw in her work an honest depiction of depression and mental health issues, as well as derision from critics who accused her of self-absorption, narcissism and relentless self-promotion.
The book took its name from an antidepressant that she was one of the first to be prescribed, and it drew comparisons to William Styron's memoir 'Darkness Visible' (1990), which had kick-started a national dialogue surrounding depression, and Susanna Kaysen's 'Girl, Interrupted' (1993), which recalled the author's mental health struggles as a young woman in the 1960s.
Ms. Wurtzel was decades younger than Styron and Kaysen and far more explicit in her descriptions of razor blades that she used to slice up her legs at age 11, sex acts that left her with chapped lips, and a 'black wave' of depression that led to a suicide attempt. Its description of a young woman's messy, emotionally torturous journey into adulthood was later viewed as a precursor to television shows such as 'Girls,' created by Lena Dunham.
'By turns wrenching and comical, self-indulgent and self-aware, 'Prozac Nation' possesses the raw candor of Joan Didion's essays, the irritating emotional exhibitionism of Sylvia Plath's 'Bell Jar' and the wry, dark humor of a Bob Dylan song,' wrote New York Times book critic Michiko Kakutani. If the memoir needed 'some strict editing,' she added, it was nonetheless marked by passages of 'sparkling, luminescent prose.'
Other critics were far less positive, including in the Times, where a Book Review contributor described Ms. Wurtzel as 'Sylvia Plath with the ego of Madonna.' But the memoir's influence was undeniable in the ensuing wave of confessional literature, said author and Yale writing instructor Anne Fadiman, notably in the 1990s bestsellers 'A Child Called 'It' ' by Dave Pelzer, 'The Liars' Club' by Mary Karr, 'Angela's Ashes' by Frank McCourt and 'The Kiss' by Kathryn Harrison.
'Even if the memoirists who followed her didn't read 'Prozac Nation' (and I bet they did),' Fadiman said by email, 'its success definitively announced several things that were especially important to women writers: It's okay to be indiscreet. It's okay to take risks. It's okay to write something that will embarrass your grandmother. It's okay to write about sex, drugs and depression.'
'Elizabeth's message was: Never sweep anything under the carpet,' she added. 'Good, bad, whatever " it's you. Embrace it. Own it. No excuses. No apologies.'
Ms. Wurtzel went on to make 'a career out of my emotions,' as she later put it, receiving a reported $500,000 advance for her second book, the essay collection 'Bitch: In Praise of Difficult Women' (1998). For the cover photo she posed topless, sneering at the camera and raising a middle finger; the opening pages included scathing quotes from reviewers, in addition to the usual roundup of praise.
By then, Ms. Wurtzel's life had been upended by cocaine, heroin and other drug use, including crushing and snorting 40 tablets of Ritalin a day. In her memoir 'More, Now, Again' (2002), she recalled smuggling cocaine into Scandinavia through her diaphragm and enlisting her drug dealer to send 'an eightball of coke' via FedEx.
Those misadventures came to an end in 1998, when Ms. Wurtzel said she stopped using drugs, aside from the antidepressants that she credited with keeping her alive. Within a decade, she also launched a new career, graduating from Yale Law School and working for several years at the white-shoe firm of Boies Schiller Flexner.
The 9/11 terrorist attacks had left her feeling 'powerless' and unable to write, she told the Times, explaining her decision to become a lawyer. (Elsewhere, she said she simply went on a whim.) But her writing never stopped " and, as it had from nearly the beginning of her career, her own life remained a focus.
In a 2018 essay for New York magazine, she wrote of discovering that Donald Wurtzel " the man she had believed for 50 years was her father " was not, in fact, her father. Instead, she said, she learned that she was the daughter of photographer Bob Adelman, a leading chronicler of the civil rights movement.
'Life,' she wrote, 'is just a shock to the system.'
Elizabeth Lee Wurtzel was born in Manhattan on July 31, 1967. Her mother, Lynne Winters, was an assistant at Random House when she had an affair with Adelman, according to Ms. Wurtzel. He remained a family friend, lived a block away and died in 2016. Ms. Wurtzel said it was only after his death that she learned of their relationship, through a call from his girlfriend and then from Winters.
At the time, Ms. Wurtzel was traveling to a physical therapy appointment as part of her breast cancer treatment, the result of a diagnosis that she attributed to the BRCA mutation. She later found that she had inherited the gene from her father.
She described her other 'father' " Donald Wurtzel, an IBM data analyst " as 'hard to reach' and said that she spent years trying to make sense of their relationship, 'in writing and therapy and conversation, with cocaine and heroin, with recovery and perseverance, and with my thoughts.' She was 2 when her parents divorced.
A precocious writer, she began putting together short books about pets at age 6, adapted Edgar Allan Poe's 'The Murders in the Rue Morgue' into a play, and studied at the Jewish day school Ramaz. She also faced crippling depression that sometimes left her unable to get out of bed.
Ms. Wurtzel graduated from Harvard College in 1989, after receiving a college journalism award from Rolling Stone for her stories in the student-run Crimson newspaper. She was fired from a Dallas Morning News internship amid accusations of plagiarism but soon found work as a music critic and began turning an unpublished 20,000-word article about Harvard into a personal account of depression.
'I was encouraged to either turn it into a novel or make it more of a sociological study of depression in young people or something,' she later told the Crimson. Originally titled 'I Hate Myself and I Want to Die,' it was changed to 'Prozac Nation' at the insistence of her editor, and adapted into a 2001 movie starring Christina Ricci.
Ms. Wurtzel also published an advice book, 'Radical Sanity' (1999, later known as 'The Bitch Rules' and 'The Secret of Life'). After receiving her law degree in 2008, she wrote about intellectual property law in the 2015 book 'Creatocracy.' She married Freed that year in a ceremony presided over by her friend and law-firm boss David Boies.
She later separated from her husband, but the couple remained close. In addition to Freed, of Manhattan, survivors include her mother, of Manhattan and Fort Lauderdale.
In a 2013 essay for New York magazine, Ms. Wurtzel wrote that she was 'fortunate to have been well paid for an almost pathological honesty,' a kind of unfiltered openness to the world that she found impossible to live without it.
'I have always made choices without considering the consequences, because I know all I get is now,' she concluded. 'Maybe I get later, too, but I will deal with that later. I choose pleasure over what is practical. I may be the only person who ever went to law school on a lark. And I wonder what I was thinking about with all those other larks, my beautiful larks, larks flying away.'

Texto completo: Secretary of War Henry Stimson and President Harry Truman agreed in 1945 that the United States should not drop an atomic bomb on Kyoto.-Stimson had seen the historical and cultural significance of Japan's ancient imperial capital when he visited during his honeymoon in 1893, so he overruled a committee that sought to target the city and explained his rationale directly to the president.-
Stimson wrote in his diary afterward that Truman 'was particularly emphatic in agreeing with my suggestion' that 'the bitterness which would be caused by such a wanton act might make it impossible during the long postwar period to reconcile the Japanese to us in that area rather than to the Russians.'
Truman reflected on that same meeting in his own diary. 'Even if the [Japanese] are savages, ruthless, merciless and fanatic,' he wrote, 'we as the leader of the world for the common welfare cannot drop that terrible bomb on the old capital or the new.'
Fast-forward 75 years: Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper, who holds the job Stimson once did, put himself at odds with President Trump on Monday night by definitively telling reporters the U.S. military will not target cultural sites inside Iran on his watch, even-if hostilities continue to escalate in the wake of the U.S. drone strike that killed Maj. Gen. Qasem Soleimani at the Baghdad airport last week.-'We will follow the laws of armed conflict,' Esper said. Asked if that means the U.S. military will not target cultural sites, he answered: 'That's the laws of armed conflict.'
Trump tweeted on Saturday that the United States has targeted 52 sites for possible retaliation, including 'some at a very high level - important to Iran - the Iranian culture.' Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One on Sunday night, the president doubled down: 'They're allowed to kill our people. They're allowed to torture and maim our people. They're allowed to use roadside bombs and blow up our people. And we're not allowed to touch their cultural sites? It doesn't work that way!'
In fact, international law does work that way.-The 1954 Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict, which the United States helped facilitate in the aftermath of World War II, requires that warring parties 'take all possible steps to protect cultural property,' which includes 'monuments of architecture, art or history, whether religious or secular.'
A 1977 amendment to the Geneva Conventions went further. It bans 'any acts of hostility directed against the historic monuments, works of art or places of worship which constitute the cultural or spiritual heritage of peoples,' and it requires that signatories neither 'use such objects in support of the military effort' nor 'make such objects the object of reprisals.'
To be sure, Stimson did not have a perfect record: He supported Japanese internment and the restrictive immigration quotas limiting how many Jewish refugees the United States accepted from Europe. More than 100,000 civilians also died from the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.-
But even during World War II, the secretary of war understood something fundamental about the power and possibility of moral leadership in what we now remember as the American century. Stimson recognized not just the aesthetic and historical value of protecting irreplaceable cultural sites but the derivative national security advantages that would flow, in what became the Cold War, from Americans holding themselves to a higher standard than their enemies.
Trump has repeatedly repudiated the very concept of American exceptionalism and espoused a variety of moral false equivalency that is deeply at odds with the republic's long bipartisan tradition.-The bellicose threat to target cultural sites is just the latest example of Trump squandering the moral high ground that generations of his predecessors worked to claim, even if they fell short at key moments. In November, Trump overruled military leaders and cleared three members of the military who were either credibly accused or convicted of war crimes. He's claimed that 'torture' works. He suggested during the 2016 campaign that he supported killing noncombatant family members of terrorists.
Brett McGurk, the former U.S. envoy to the international coalition fighting the Islamic State from 2015 to 2018, characterized Trump's latest threats as 'unAmerican.'
'American military forces adhere to international law,' he tweeted. 'They don't attack cultural sites. And they're not mercenaries. Reckless and unprecedented words from a Commander-in-Chief.'-
Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), a former military lawyer in the Air Force Reserve, said he urged Trump to stop threatening cultural sites during a Monday phone call. 'We're not at war with the culture of the Iranian people,' Graham told the New York Times. 'We're in a conflict with the theology, the ayatollah and his way of doing business. I think the president saying 'we will hit you hard' is the right message. Cultural sites is not hitting them hard; it's creating more problems.'
'Targeting civilians and cultural sites is what terrorists do,' added Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), a member of the Foreign Relations Committee. 'It's a war crime.'
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson also publicly broke with Trump on Monday, with his spokesman declaring that he will not abide Trump's threat to target Iranian cultural sites.-
Iran is home to 22 cultural UNESCO World Heritage sites, including the ancient ruins of Persepolis. (The UNESCO website has the full list, with pictures and descriptions of each site.)-
Trump's saber-rattling is particularly noteworthy because the United States has historically led the international community in codifying restrictions on the targeting of cultural heritage.-'In March 2017 " only weeks after Trump's inauguration " the U.N. Security Council, with the United States as a permanent member, unanimously adopted a resolution condemning the 'unlawful destruction of cultural heritage, inter alia destruction of religious sites and artefacts' in armed conflicts,' The Washington Post's Rick Noack reports.


The Post's art and architecture critic Philip Kennicott laments: 'If we are to be a barbarian nation, what are our new limits? Do we have any?
'In March 2001, the Taliban regime in Afghanistan began to dynamite the 6th-century statues of Buddha in Bamian,' Kennicott writes. 'The decision was both impetuous and brutal, in part an exercise in fundamentalist iconoclasm, in part an act of defiance and rage against the world at large. It was a galvanizing moment in the recent history of cultural heritage. . . . Fourteen years later, the Islamic State's destruction at Palmyra did much the same work of branding, defining the cruel so-called caliphate as an organization beyond all bounds.-Our leadership has been imperfect and sometimes hypocritical. But when a lack of U.S. leadership led to the looting of Baghdad's antiquities museum during the 2003 Gulf War, the U.S. response wasn't to claim a basic right to destroy culture. We argued the 'fog of war.' It was defensive, muddled and wrong, but not amoral. . . .
'A statement Sunday decrying Trump's words, signed by cultural heritage experts in anthropology, archaeology and the museum world, details recent progress during the Trump administration, including the Smithsonian Institution's plans to assist the Army in training a new corps of 'monuments men,' experts who can help the military avoid cultural destruction. . . . The new line, the one we crossed this weekend, isn't between one set of cultural values vs. another; it isn't between people who speak our language and those who speak all others.'

Ghosn and Japan Inc. Can Make Up; There is plenty of disgrace to go around, which points to a possible plea deal.

Texto completo: There are two reasons to become a fugitive: because you're afraid you'll get justice or afraid you won't. This column first used these words not in relation to Carlos Ghosn but in relation to Jacob "Kobi" Alexander, the tech CEO who fled to Namibia in 2006 rather than face prosecution in the stock-option backdating scandals.
The interesting case, of course, is not the completely innocent person, but one who may be guilty of something but fears being strung up out of all proportion to an alleged wrong. When all was said and done, a prominent lawyer later explained to the New York Times, the backdating "prosecutions went out with a whimper rather than a bang," not least because judges and juries came to see how a hysterical press had exaggerated the nature of the offense involved.
From his haven in Namibia, Mr. Alexander eventually faced justice voluntarily, serving time and likely judging his flight to have been a bad decision all things considered.
Which brings us to Mr. Ghosn. He who flees to put himself under a friendlier country's laws is not in precisely the same position as one who dons a false mustache and goes underground. In the case of a politically hot fugitive, another consideration may also come into play: His escape is not entirely unwelcome. As a source " close to Nissan " told the Journal, "We wanted it to stop. In Japan, New Year's is about driving evil spirits out of the house. In that way [Mr. Ghosn's departure] is the perfect story for New Year's."
In 1999, as a top officer at Renault, Mr. Ghosn arranged the alliance that saved Nissan from bankruptcy, using "ruthless competence" as a Japanese newspaper put it. In later years, he was in charge of setting his own pay, which he kept in line with what GM and Ford chief executives were earning. Then came the 2008 financial crisis, and Japan enacted a new disclosure rule along with ill-advised caps on what board members could be paid. Because he feared political blowback in Japan or in France (accounts vary), Mr. Ghosn chose to begin deferring about half his paycheck until after he retired.
These arrangements were apparently memorialized in writing but not guaranteed. A future CEO would still have to sign off on each payment. Mr. Ghosn reportedly told prosecutors that he was advised this meant the commitments did not have to be disclosed under Japanese law.
The amounts involved here add up to less than 0.01% of Nissan's annual revenue. Mr. Ghosn's total pay was approximately half what Sean Hannity is reported to make for his TV show.
Mr. Ghosn is a rich man, worth an estimated $120 million before his troubles began, but not stock-option rich or private-equity rich in the American sense—though he certainly would have been bombarded with job offers to become so.
While he may not be wholly innocent of record-keeping and disclosure violations that in other countries would be regulatory issues, a big factor in Mr. Ghosn's arrest was a new Japanese plea-bargaining scheme introduced just months earlier. Under its terms, two Nissan executives were reportedly directed by the company to plead guilty to crimes that Mr. Ghosn could then be implicated in. All this came as Mr. Ghosn was seeking to make permanent the Renault-Nissan alliance by formally merging the two companies, under a deal that necessarily would have left Renault's shareholders, as the original rescuers, in a superior position.
Mr. Ghosn may have been high-handed; he may have tended to treat Nissan's resources as his own. But he likely was a lot less guilty than the Japanese legal system was getting ready to make him simply to ensure that Nissan remained a Japanese-controlled company.
His Japanese lawyer has admitted advising his client that he could not expect a fair trial in Japan but might still win. With a few more paragraphs to work with, I might even weave in a Jeffrey Epstein parallel. After all, the parties in Japan Inc. who are happy now to avoid a Carlos Ghosn trial are undoubtedly numerous, including Nissan's new leadership, which has been running the company into the ground while struggling with legal problems of its own.
In choosing to flee, Mr. Ghosn enjoyed an option unavailable to others caught up in Japan's nobody-is-innocent, everybody-confesses trial system. Perversely, Japan's new plea-bargain scheme, introduced in June 2018, likely only worsens a predilection for false confessions. The subjects under whose noses these plea deals are dangled can be interrogated under onerous conditions without defense counsel present. They hardly need to be reminded that fewer than 1% of defendants are acquitted at trial.
Reforms are plainly needed. Mr. Ghosn is expected to address the media on Wednesday from his bolt-hole in Beirut. Various outcomes have been bruited. A good one would be a proper (U.S. style) plea bargain in which both sides lose a little face and recognize that there's plenty of disgrace to go around.

Boeing Backs MAX Simulator Training in Reversal of Stance; Airlines face added complications in returning aircraft to service once regulators give go-ahead

Texto completo: Boeing Co. recommended extra flight-simulator training for 737 MAX pilots, a humbling and costly reversal of a longstanding design principle that helped the aircraft maker minimize the time and expense for airlines to start flying the jets.
Boeing had steadfastly argued, even after two 737 MAX crashes, that pilot training on personal computers or laptops alone was sufficient. On Tuesday, the company disclosed its new position—one that in the process jettisons a decadesold safety assumption that pilots typically respond to emergencies in mere seconds.
The move is the latest sign that new leadership at Boeing is seeking a more conciliatory approach toward national regulators, many of whom had bristled at the company's effort to flag when the plane would be cleared to fly. Last month, Boeing named David Calhoun to be its new chief executive, effective Jan. 13.
At the same time, the training recommendation could complicate preparations by airlines to return the grounded aircraft to service once regulators give the go-ahead. Though the move was gaining support within the Federal Aviation Administration, some of Boeing's most loyal customers were upset at the abrupt announcement and lack of consultation by the plane maker, according to government and industry officials.
One of the main selling points for the MAX when the aircraft was first offered in 2011 was that airlines wouldn't have to subject flight crews to extra simulator sessions. New requirements could make it more difficult for carriers to seamlessly substitute pilots and planes when needed. The final cost hinges on the type and length of the training mandated by regulators.
As part of Boeing's initial marketing campaign, the plane maker promised to refund Southwest Airlines Co. $1 million for each MAX purchased if the jets ended up requiring extra simulator time for crews, according to congressional investigators and industry officials familiar with the specifics.
Southwest, the largest MAX operator with 34 of the jets in its fleet at the time of the grounding in March, said it is awaiting final direction from regulators, but has been modeling scenarios for both simulator and computer-based training requirements.
Boeing's shift in position threatens to further delay the return of the MAX to passenger service. Southwest and American Airlines are currently aiming to fly the MAX again in April, while United Airlines isn't planning to fly the plane again until June.
"It certainly doesn't bode well for a near-term return to service," Greg Bowen, chairman of the training and standards committee at the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association.
Airlines and leasing companies already were saying it could take 18 months or more to put into service the entire global fleet of about 800 jets, including 420 undelivered aircraft. Boeing is halting MAX production this month to prevent the backlog growing.
Carriers are seeking details about whether the training sessions will have to take place in a simulator designed specifically for the MAX. There are about 35 such simulators available. Among U.S. airlines, Southwest has three, American Airlines Group Inc. has one, and United Airlines Holdings Inc. has one, though United's doesn't have full motion capability. Additional simulators are on the way this year.
Boeing's move also reflects how dramatically the 737 MAX crisis, stemming from crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia that cost 346 lives, has altered some longstanding standards for aircraft design, training and regulation.
For decades, Boeing and the FAA have maintained that the typical pilot would need no more than four seconds to react to most cockpit emergencies. Now, they consider 10 or 15 seconds as a more likely needed by pilots to react to a wide range of cockpit emergencies, according to industry and government experts participating in the deliberations.
The reassessment, which has been under way with regulators for months, means that engineers, aviation authorities and carriers no longer will be able to rely as heavily as they did on pilots to serve as ultimate backstops when onboard systems malfunction or automated flight-control features go haywire.
Advanced simulators, which closely mimic changes in cockpit instruments as well as what pilots feel during actual aircraft maneuvers, are designed to provide more-realistic experiences enabling crews to understand emergencies and practice responding to them.
Boeing had previously said it expected some airlines to opt for simulator training, but viewed computer-based education as providing all necessary information for pilots on software fixes to the MAX's flight-control computers
The Chicago aerospace giant had long maintained 737 MAX pilots don't need supplemental simulator training beyond what pilots receive to fly other 737 models, a stance that many FAA officials now regard with increasing skepticism, The Wall Street Journal reported this week.
Regulators in the U.S. and overseas will make their own decision on the eventual details and extent of pilot training. From Canada to Europe to parts of Japan, some had strongly signaled they favored extra simulator sessions.
The FAA hadn't formally laid out its position but Boeing's announcement effectively gives the agency little choice—from a political or public relations standpoint—but to accept the recommendation.
Greg Smith, Boeing's interim chief executive until Mr. Calhoun takes over, said in a statement Tuesday that combining simulator sessions and computer-based training would help build confidence among the flying public, airlines and other stakeholders. Boeing's recommendation to back simulator training was earlier reported by the New York Times.
An FAA spokesman said the agency will consider Boeing's position as a cadre of international airline pilots reviews training issues in coming weeks, adding that data from those tests will be used to draft a report that eventually will be available for public comment.
"The agency will not approve the aircraft for return to service until all parts of the certification process are completed to its satisfaction," the FAA said.
The FAA's changed outlook on simulator training has arisen partly because Boeing and regulators are proposing rewriting some emergency checklists for pilots and creating some new ones, according to people familiar with the details. Those changes reflect dramatically revised assumptions of how quickly pilots, during actual flights, are likely to respond to emergencies.
In the past, the FAA, Boeing and the rest of the industry used highly experienced test pilots in simulator settings to verify the four-second pilot response standard. In recent months, however, accident investigators and international safety regulators have sharply criticized those old assumptions as potentially dangerous, while urging new types of testing using a wide array of pilots from different regions of the globe with varying training and experience levels.
The arguments for extra training also were boosted, according to one person briefed on the details, by results of recent FAA-sponsored simulator sessions that revealed that roughly one out of two aviators failed to strictly follow prescribed procedures in order to regain control of their aircraft.

Texto completo: Julián Castro, the former US housing secretary whose progressive presidential candidacy did not make significant inroads with Democratic voters but earned plaudits from the party's left wing, has endorsed Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, offering a possible lift for her candidacy less than one month before the Iowa caucuses.
Castro revealed his endorsement Monday morning, just days after he ended his own bid for the White House. In a statement, Castro cast Warren as the logical extension of his campaign's social-justice-driven message, which seeks to correct inequities through targeted policy proposals. He will campaign with Warren this week, joining her Tuesday night at a rally at Kings Theatre in New York City.
The endorsement formalizes a partnership that could help Warren reignite excitement at a critical moment.
Warren has fallen from her polling peak in early October, when she was hailed as the front-runner and standard-bearer for the party's progressive wing. National polls now show Warren firmly in third, behind former vice president Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who has been aided by grass-roots progressive groups and by some high-profile endorsements of his own, including from popular House Democrats like Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez from New York, and Ilhan Omar from Minnesota.
It is unclear whether Castro's name carries similar political weight. His presidential candidacy struggled to break through in a significant way, but he led the field on a number of progressive issues, including reparations, border decriminalization, and housing inequality.
Warren thanked Castro for his support Monday, calling him “a powerful voice for bold, progressive change."

A Kennedy to run against Van Drew in New Jersey
A member of the Kennedy family, a former public school teacher, said Monday she will run as a Democrat against party-switching Republican US Representative Jeff Van Drew in New Jersey.
Amy Kennedy, who is married to former Democratic US representative Patrick Kennedy, revealed her candidacy for the 2nd District House seat in an online video.
Van Drew won election in 2018 as a Democrat but said last month he was becoming a Republican when he said he opposed impeaching President Trump. Trump praised Van Drew and hosted him at the White House, where the congressman pledged his support.
Kennedy, a yearslong resident of Brigantine, north of Atlantic City, highlighted the economy and environmental issues in the minutelong video announcing her run.
She also criticized the president and Van Drew for contributing to a decline in morality in public discourse.
A message seeking a response was left with Van Drew.
Van Drew's party switch has opened up a competitive Democratic primary, with Kennedy facing several challengers.
Among the competitors are Montclair State University political science professor Brigid Harrison, a longtime southern New Jersey resident who has garnered support from Democratic lawmakers already.
Atlantic County Freeholder Ashley Bennett has also said she is running. Former FBI agent Robert Turkavage is also in the race.

Pompeo tells McConnell he won't seek Senate seat
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Monday told Senator Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, that he does not plan to run for Senate in 2020, dashing Republicans' hopes of securing a dominant candidate for the open seat in his home state of Kansas, according to four people briefed on the meeting.
Pompeo, a former congressman from the Wichita area, has quietly explored a campaign for months. But in the aftermath of the military operation last week that killed General Qassem Soleimani of Iran, Pompeo has told senior party officials that he is ruling out becoming a candidate, according to several people who have spoken with him.
Pompeo still has time to change his mind. The filing deadline for the primary is not until June. However, administration officials who have spoken with him in recent days said he seemed adamant about not entering the race.
Without Pompeo in the race, Republicans face an unsettled primary that includes one candidate, Kris Kobach, whom party leaders fear could imperil their hold on a crucial open Senate seat. Kobach is popular with hard-right voters but widely disliked among moderates and independent voters.

Iran mourns, vows direct hit

Texto completo: US officials on Monday braced for Iran to respond to the killing of its most powerful general, as hundreds of thousands of Iranians poured into the streets of Tehran for a funeral procession and the country's supreme leader wept openly over the coffin.
The funeral for Major General Qassem Soleimani drew a crowd said by police to be in the millions in the Iranian capital, filling thoroughfares and side streets as far as the eye could see.
Although there was no independent estimate, aerial footage and Associated Press journalists suggested a turnout of at least 1 million.
Meanwhile, it was learned that in the tense hours following last week's killing, Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, made a rare appearance at a meeting of the government's National Security Council to lay down the parameters for any retaliation. It must be a direct and proportional attack on American interests, he said, openly carried out by Iranian forces themselves, three Iranians familiar with the meeting said Monday.
It was a startling departure for the Iranian leadership. Since the establishment of the Islamic Republic in 1979, Tehran had almost always cloaked its attacks behind the actions of proxies it had cultivated around the region. But in the fury generated by the killing of Soleimani, a close ally and personal friend of the supreme leader, the ayatollah was willing to cast aside those traditional cautions.
The nation's anger over the commander's death was on vivid display during the funeral procession Monday. After weeks of furious protests across the country against corruption and misrule, both those who had criticized and supported the government marched together, united in outrage. Subway trains and stations were packed with mourners hours before dawn, and families brought children carrying photos of Soleimani.
A reformist politician, Sadegh Kharazi, said he had not seen crowds this size since the 1989 funeral of the Islamic Republic's founder, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
“We are ready to take a fierce revenge against America," General Hamid Sarkheili of the Revolutionary Guard, declared to the throng. “American troops in the Persian Gulf and in Iraq and Syria are within our reach."
“No negotiations or deal, only war with America," students chanted in an online video from a university campus.
A renowned eulogist and member of the Revolutionary Guard, Sadegh Ahangaran, exhorted the funeral crowds to raise their voices so “damned America can hear you" and to “wave the flags in preparation for war."
The increasingly public vows of direct action on Monday constituted Iran's latest act of defiance to President Trump.
The president had repeatedly threatened to retaliate for any attacks against American interests by ordering airstrikes against as many as 52 potential targets, one for each of the American hostages held after the seizure of the US embassy in Tehran in 1979.
In response, Iran's moderate president, Hassan Rouhani, on Monday offered his own numerology. “Those who refer to the number 52 should also remember the number 290," he said on Twitter, a reference to the 290 people killed in 1988 in the accidental downing of an Iranian airliner by a US warship. “Never threaten the Iranian nation," Rouhani added.
Where, when, and even if Iran may choose to retaliate remains a matter of speculation. As Iranian leaders weighed just what form it might take, analysts said the targets included American troops in neighboring Syria and Iraq, American bases in the Persian Gulf, or American embassies or diplomats almost anywhere.
When previous attempts at direct strikes or assassinations have proved unsuccessful, some noted, Iranian-backed militants have turned to the simpler tactic of killing civilians with terrorist bombs.
This was the sequence in 2012 with the Iranian-backed Lebanese group Hezbollah. After failing in attempts to attack Israeli targets or kill Israeli officials in revenge for the killing of one of the group's leaders, the militants eventually bombed a bus load of Israeli tourists in Bulgaria, said Afshon Ostovar, a scholar of Iran at the Naval Postgraduate School.
“We are in uncharted territory, and the truth of the matter is nobody knows how Iran is going to respond. I don't think even Iran knows," Ostovar said. “But I think there is a blood lust right now in the Revolutionary Guards."
US officials are also aware that Iran could try to strike a high-level American leader in a “tit-for-tat" move, potentially a military commander, the Associated Press reported.
In Iraq, where the Parliament had earlier called for the immediate expulsion of the 5,000 American troops stationed there, Prime Minister Mahdi on Monday listed steps to curtail the troops' movements.
While plans were being made for departure of the Americans, he said, they will now be limited to “training and advising" Iraqi forces, required to remain within the bases and barred from Iraqi air space.
Abdul-Mahdi met with Matthew Tueller, the American ambassador to Iraq, on Monday, and “stressed the need for joint action to implement the withdrawal," according to a statement and photo released by Abdul-Mahdi's office. He also emphasized Iraq's efforts to prevent the current tensions between Iran and the United States from sliding into “open war."
The United States military stirred a media flurry by accidentally releasing a draft letter that seemed to describe imminent plans to withdraw from Iraq.
But Defense Department officials played down the significance of the letter.
“There's been no decision whatsoever to leave Iraq," Defense Secretary Mark T. Espersaid. “There's been no decision made to leave Iraq. Period."
Meanwhile, senior administration officials have begun drafting sanctions against Iraq after Trump publicly threatened the country with economic penalties if it proceeded to expel US troops, according to three people briefed on the planning.
Such a step would represent a highly unusual move against a foreign ally that the United States has spent almost two decades and hundreds of billions of dollars supporting.
The officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were discussing internal deliberations, stressed that talks were preliminary and that no final decision has been made on whether to impose the sanctions.
Although the Trump administration has said that the United States killed Soleimani because he was planning imminent attacks against American interests, there were indications Monday that he may have been leading an effort to calm tensions with Saudi Arabia.
Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi of Iraq said that he was supposed to meet with Soleimani on the morning he was killed and that he expected him to bring messages from the Iranians that might help to “reach agreements and breakthroughs important for the situation in Iraq and the region."
In Washington, two top Senate Democrats urged Trump Monday to declassify the administration's formal notification to Congress giving notice of the airstrike that killed Soleimani.
Such notification of Congress is required by law, and to classify the entirety of such a notification is highly unusual.
Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, and Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey, the top Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, said in a joint statement that it was “critical that national security matters of such import be shared with the American people in a timely manner."

Texto completo: ROTTERDAM, the Netherlands - Sjarel Ex stood in the basement of the Boijmans van Beuningen Museum, ankle-deep in rising waters, facing a Sophie's choice.
Rotterdam's fire chief had told him that the collection of paintings would be destroyed within 30 minutes unless Ex, a co-director of the museum, gave permission to sandbag the library, sacrificing the books.
In the end, the art was saved and only a couple of hundred volumes lost. But the 2013 event catalyzed Ex's campaign to move the collection. "From that moment on, we were not so very polite about the need to have a new storage facility," he said.
He fought for this aspartofaplan to close the 1935 museum for renovations, which were already under discussion.
But rather than building a fortified "blackbox" somewhere, Ex said he saw an opportunity to do something radical by opening the museum's storage to the public while the main building was closed.
"The first plans were that maybe 20 or 40% would be accessible," Ex said. "At a certain moment, we said, 'Why don't we make it entirely accessible?'"
Six years later, the museum is spending nearly 85 million euros ($95 million) on the Depot Boijmans van Beuningen, a glittering, mirrored building. Designed by MVRDV architects, the storage center is in the city center, right next to the museum. The main building is closed for a 234 million euro renovation of its own, set to reopen in late 2025; the Depot will remain.
When completed in 2021, the Depot will contain the museum's entire collection of 151,000 artworks, as well as curators' offices, conservation studios, a movie theater, a restaurant and a rooftop garden. Visitors will be able to walk among the storage racks and pull out items, accompanied by guides and guards. Ex hopes it will attract 150,000 to 250,000 people a year.
The Depot represents a shift in thinking about the public's access to an institution. Ex estimated that about 6% or 7% of most major museum holdings are on view at any moment.
As collections have grown increasingly vast in the past several decades, institutions are seeking to balance two mandates: protecting and preserving works, and sharing as much as possible with the public.
Plans for the Depot have drawn officials from museums in Finland, Norway, South Korea and Sweden to Rotterdam, curious to view it as a model, said Ina Klaassen, the Boijmans' other director.
In Paris, the museums along the Seine that are vulnerable to flooding - including the Louvre, the Musée d'Orsay and the Musée du Quai Branly - are considering storage solutions that maybe partly open to the public. (Officials from Paris have visited to look at Rotterdam's plans.)
The Victoria and Albert Museum in London is following close on the heels of the Boijmans Depot, with its V&A East storage facility expected to open in 2023. The new space will house about 250,000 objects and 1,000 separate archives, which visitors can explore.
Tim Reeve, the strategic leader of the project, said V&A East would be "an endlessly changing cabinet of curiosities" from the collections of furniture, fashion, textiles and art. He said that visitors could also learn from curators how exhibitions are planned and watch conservators at work.
Other museums have taken small steps toward open access, with so-called visible storage. The Henry Luce Foundation has supported "open study" centers at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, at the Smithsonian American Art Museum in Washington and at the Brooklyn Museum that allow visitors to see works in storage, usually in curated displays that can be viewed only through glass walls.

Obama and Trump reading lists, compared

Texto completo: Former President Barack Obama has published his list of favorite books of 2019. The former president, who was known to read an hour a day toward the end of his presidency, has curated a selection that he noted on Instagram is part of the "fabric that helps make up a life" and can hopefully "enhance our day-to-day experiences."
What a contrast to President Donald Trump's list of books, which he recently promoted on Twitter.
While the books that Obama recommends will make readers more well-rounded and informed, Trump's list is filled with books that will make the reader angrier and more supportive of Trump. (Even as president, when Obama released his summer reading list, the titles ranged from books about former President John Adams to novels like, "The Bayou Trilogy." None were explicitly about Obama's political agenda or attacking his political rivals.)
Let's take a closer look at Obama's 2019 list. It includes works of fiction, such as "Normal People," a story of two starkly different people from the same small town who must confront how far they will go to support each other. There's also the award-winning novel, "Trust Exercise," by Susan Choi, the story of students in the 1980s at a competitive performing arts high school that the Amazon description notes "will leave readers with wiser understandings of the true capacities of adolescents and of the powers and responsibilities of adults."
Obama also highlights numerous thought-provoking non-fiction books, such as the New York Times best-seller "Say Nothing: A True Story of Murder and Memory in Northern Ireland," which has been described as a "mesmerizing book on the bitter conflict in Northern Ireland and its aftermath."
And then there's the "Thę Heartbeat of Wounded Knee: Native America from 1890 to the Present" by David Treuer, a brutally honest examination of how Native Americans flourished for generations until European powers and the United States government enslaved, killed and displaced these proud people from their ancestral homes.
What a contrast to Trump's recommended books, which are almost all designed to do one thing: help Trump, politically, that is. In October, Trump praised the book, "Resistance (At All Costs): How Trump Haters Are Breaking America" by Wall Street Journal columnist Kim Strassel, tweeting, "A great book by a brilliant author. Buy it now!" This book, per the Amazon summary, argues that it's not Trump who is a threat to our democracy, but those who criticize Trump, claiming that "the president's foes have thrown aside norms, due process and the rule of law." (It sounds like a Trump tweet in book form.)
In November, Trump took to Twitter to praise the new book, "The Plot Against the President: The True Story of How Congressman Devin Nunes Uncovered the Biggest Political Scandal in U.S. History" by Lee Smith. This book tells the story of how the California representative and vocal Trump defender allegedly uncovered an operation to bring down Trump. Obviously this book furthers Trump's narrative that he's the victim of a "witch hunt," which makes it no surprise that Trump tweeted, "great new book" adding, "Shows very bad and corrupt people on the other side. Check it out!"
Also making Trump's recommended reading list in November was the book written by his son Donald Trump Jr. bearing a title that is quintessential Trump: "Triggered: How the Left Thrives on Hate and Wants to Silence Us." The younger Trump's book, according to the online summary, promises to "expose all the tricks that the left uses to smear conservatives and push them out of the public square."
And let's not overlook Trump's recommended books in 2018 that fit this same mold. There was Fox News host Judge Jeanine Pirro's book titled, "Liars, Leakers and Liberals, the Case Against the Anti-Trump Conspiracy." Trump tweeted at the time of its release, "fantastic" - adding, "Go get it!" And who can forget Fox News commentator Gregg Jarrett's book, "The Russia Hoax, The Illicit Scheme To Clear Hillary Clinton And Frame Donald Trump," which Trump promoted before its release and then again praised later, adding that the Russia investigation was "illegally started by people who have already been disgraced."
In short, Trump only promotes books he believes will support his political tenure. Many of them achieve this by furthering the narrative that Trump is a victim of a corrupt establishment and that he alone can save the country from a Democratic Party hellbent on his demise.
While Obama's recommended books are designed to make life a "little brighter," Trump's books are designed to do the exact opposite - inspiring fear and anger in the next election cycle.

Texto completo: ON CHRISTMAS DAY, Greta Gerwig's updated version of the young adult classic Little Women opened in theaters to great acclaim, fantastic reviews, and strong box office numbers.
And yet, some women found fault with the fact that not enough men were flocking to see it.
In a piece for the New York Times, writer Kristy Eldredge observed that the film hadn't garnered a lot of award nominations from the Screen Actors Guild (zero) and the Golden Globes (two) and mentioned that the audiences seemed to be overwhelmingly filled with women. Film producer Amy Pascal agrees, arguing in Vanity Fair that many male awards-season voters are skipping Gerwig's adaptation because they think it's not for guys.
Eldredge seemed to blame men for not appreciating female-centric stories and framed it as some sort of character flaw that society needed to address: "If many men haven't wanted to give it a chance because they don't think it's meant for them, we still have a way to go in considering all kinds of narratives about women to be deserving of thoughtful attention."
It's not surprising that a story about the relationship between four Civil War-era sisters written more than 150 years ago and with absolutely no battlefield scenes is not a favorite with the Xbox set. While there has always been some cross-gender interest in young adult literature like A Separate Peace and Catcher in the Rye, which have strong male characters, there is a universality of message in those books. In other words, Holden Caulfield's existential angst and the rough contours of Gene and Phinny's tragic friendship have resonance beyond their masculinity. You could imagine a female Holden, or an equally traumatic betrayal between two young women at an all-girls school.
But Little Women is really just a movie about young women, and their dreams and aspirations and disappointments, and that's perfectly OK. In fact, it's sublime. The book and the movies adapted from it are some of the most touching examples of female bonding in literary and cinematic history. As a Bryn Mawr graduate - like Katharine Hepburn - I am partial to the 1933 film, but Gerwig's adaptation is exceptional and deserving of all the accolades it will earn, despite the naysayers.
But it is a bit ridiculous for women to be complaining that men are not interested in a book and movie called, for lord's sake, Little WOMEN. This preoccupation with "gender parity" has become cultlike.
I know a bunch of boys around the age of 11 or 12 who love dinosaurs and Jedis. They also love Harry Potter, The Lord of the Rings, R.L. Stine, and any number of things that girls the same age might also enjoy. These are clearly things that bridge a gender divide because they are not specifically "male" or "female."
But when I was growing up, there were toys you gave to boys and toys you gave to girls, and it was not considered a hate crime to insist that your daughter not be given a GI Joe doll or that your son put down the Barbie. It was OK to recognize that there were stereotypes for a reason, namely, that boys and girls had different interests.
I don't share the angst over a presumed lack of interest on the part of men about the destinies of Meg, Jo, Amy, and Beth March.
Ironically, Louisa May Alcott herself wasn't thrilled with the idea of writing what she called a "girls' story." She wrote in her diary: "I plod away, though I don't enjoy this sort of thing. Never liked girls or knew many, except my sisters; but our queer plays and experiences may prove interesting, though I doubt it."
If even the writer of this wonderful girls' story doesn't expect boys to like it, why in the world should we?

Texto completo: Because Lewes is perched on the doorstep of the Atlantic, the seafaring tradition runs deep. From expert bay pilots to simple deck hands, from captains of oceangoing ships to skippers of humble menhaden fishing boats, mariners of all stripes have called Lewes home.
With the development of the railroad in the 19th century and the arrival of the automobile in the early 20th century, many Lewes residents turned from the sea, but two frightening fires and one Midwestern newspaper reminded the people of Lewes again of their proud seafaring heritage.
In the early decades of the 20th century, the Clyde Steamship Company operated several passenger ships between ports along the Atlantic coast, but Lewes was not one of them.
On Jan. 1, 1925, the Clyde liner Mohawk, commanded by Captain James Staples and carrying 200 passengers, left the dreary winter weather in New York City and set sail for sunny Jacksonville, Florida.
Steaming along the New Jersey coast, the ship encountered an icy storm that pounded the vessel with high, cold waves. During the night, members of the crew methodically knocked on stateroom doors and announced, "Get up, the ship's on fire!"
The fire had started in the afterhold and threatened to consume the entire ship. After Captain Staples radioed for assistance, two tugs, the Mars and the Kaleen, had steamed out of Lewes harbor to help.
The Coast Guard Cutter Kickapoo, stationed at Cape May, heard the distress call and sailed into the storm to help. The passenger liner Persian also diverted course to aid the stricken ship. As the Mohawk burned, the weather continued to deteriorate, and the fire continued to grow.
As the ship's crew circulated among the passengers to assure them that help was on its way, Mohawk steamed full speed ahead toward the Delaware Bay.
Despite the obvious danger, there was no panic among the passengers. Captain Staples turned the Mohawk into Delaware Bay, where several vessels had gathered to help those aboard the burning liner.
As the Mohawk shuttered to a halt and listed sharply to starboard, passengers, crew and Captain Staples were methodically transferred to rescue vessels. The Mohawk was a smoldering wreck, but not a life was lost.
Eleven months later in November, another passenger ship, the Lenape, carrying over 300 passengers, also caught fire along the New Jersey coast. In a remarkable repeat of the Mohawk disaster, the Lenape turned into Delaware Bay, where all but one of those aboard the ship were rescued.
One man who put his life-preserver on upside down and jumped off the ship was drowned.
During the two fiery disasters, over 500 people were saved by the Coast Guard, passing vessels and the seafaring community of Lewes.
The cool seamanship and professionalism of the rescuers received well-deserved national recognition, but a Midwestern newspaper, far from the ocean, perhaps said it best.
In an editorial titled, "A Thrill of Pride," the Indianapolis Times commented after the Mohawk fire, "(The rescuers) have shown what American seamen can do on American ships, even when the ships are sinking. They have stirred the hearts of millions of inland living Americans who had almost forgotten that we had coast lines and a merchant marine.
"They, and the Coast Guard men who aided them, have lived up to the best traditions of the sailors of all time, and in so doing they have proved that the claims of the United States to a place in the world as a seafaring nation are real."

The art world saw out the end of the 2010s with the story of a banana; specifically, Maurizio Cattelan’s infamous piece of fruit duct-taped to a wall at Art Basel Miami Beach. It now appears that the first big story of this decade could revolve around a fruit salad, when New York-based artist Darren Bader opens his latest exhibition at the Whitney Museum of American Art titled “Fruits, Vegetables; Fruit and Vegetable Salad” (on view from January 15 to February 20).
The exhibition, which will show untitled work by Darren Bader from the Whitney’s permanent collection that was acquired in 2015 and never before presented by the museum, will feature a wide and somewhat unusual selection of fruits and vegetables posing as sculptures on pedestals. At scheduled times throughout the week (Mondays, Wednesdays, and Sundays from 3 to 6 p.m., and Fridays from 7.30 to 10 p.m.) museum staff will remove the fruit and vegetables and create a fruit salad while the gallery sits empty. The preparing of the produce will be captured on video in the museum’s Studio Cafe Kitchen, projected in the gallery, and served up to visitors. The process will then repeat.

Bader has a history of work that, on the surface, could read as a series of pranks. His Whitney Biennial piece in 2014 displayed two donation boxes stating, “All donations will go to something,” and “All donations will go to nothing.” He injected a piece of lasagna with heroin in a 2012 work titled “lasagna on heroin” and released a pair of goats into Andrew Kreps Gallery in New York in 2011.
Yet, beyond the prank exterior, Bader has gained acclaim as a conceptual artist for his interrogation of the point of art and exploration of art’s possibilities. The artist told the New York Times last year that he is “a writer, first and foremost”, existing in the space between writing, sculpture and curating. His previous exhibitions have also often been collaborative. Often drawing from everyday objects, he provokes the viewer into facing the absurdity of reality. When wanting to learn more about his work, his website itself sends you on a confusing journey through links, videos, and pop-up boxes encouraging you to download PDF files.
The exhibition’s curator and senior curatorial assistant at the Whitney, Christie Mitchell, first became familiar with Bader’s work in 2015, after they acquired it for the collection. “After conducting grocery shopping according to the artist’s instructions, and setting up the fruits and vegetables on pedestals with our art handling team, I was struck by the uncanny nature of the produce as sculpture, and how beautiful they looked in the gallery,” Mitchell recalls.
“Finding over 40 varied and distinctive fruits and vegetables in the middle of winter is no small task, but we’ve been planning our shopping trips and we’re thrilled to be serving salad.” says Mitchell. And, as with all of Bader’s works, you can expect the salad to be served with a side of playfulness, provocation and a conceptual examination of the age-old question: “what does this really mean?”

Texto completo: Weinstein charged with sex crimes in L.A. on eve of N.Y. trial
LOS ANGELES - Los Angeles prosecutors charged Harvey Weinstein on Monday with sexually assaulting two women on successive nights during Oscars week in 2013, bringing the new case against the disgraced Hollywood mogul on the eve of jury selection for his New York trial.
The case, brought by a task force set up by the Los Angeles County district attorney to investigate sex-crime allegations against entertainment figures, now puts Weinstein in deep legal peril on both coasts, where he built a career as the one of the most powerful - and feared - figures in show business before a barrage of accusations from more than 75 women led to his downfall and ignited the #MeToo movement.
Weinstein, 67, was charged with raping a woman at a Los Angeles hotel on Feb. 18, 2013, after pushing his way inside her room, then sexually assaulting a woman in a Beverly Hills hotel suite the next night. He could get up to 28 years in prison on charges of forcible rape, forcible oral copulation, sexual penetration by use of force and sexual battery.
"We see you, we hear you and we believe you"' District Attorney Jackie Lacey said in announcing the charges, addressing herself to the studio boss's accusers.
Los Angeles Police Chief Michel Moore said the charges open the "next chapter" for a man "who has gotten away with too much for too long," while Beverly Hills Chief Sandra Spagnoli called the cases "horrendous crimes perpetrated by a sexual predator."
Lawyers for Weinstein had no immediate comment on the new charges, though he has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.
Jury selection is set to begin today in the New York case, in which Weinstein is charged with raping a woman in a New York City hotel room in 2013 and forcibly performing a sex act on another woman in 2006. He has said any sexual activity was consensual. If convicted of the most serious charges, predatory sexual assault, he faces a mandatory life sentence.
"The walls of justice are closing in on Harvey Weinstein. He is now being prosecuted both in New York and Los Angeles," attorney Gloria Allred exulted in a statement. Allred represents one of the alleged victims in the New York case as well as actress Annabella Sciorra, who is scheduled to testify against Weinstein in New York.
The charges announced Monday in Los Angeles took more than two years to file because the women were reluctant to provide all the information necessary, according to Lacey. The alleged attacks follow a pattern similar to the offenses described in the New York case, dozens of lawsuits and women's accounts to media outlets.
The first accuser is an Italian actress, according to her attorney, David Ring. The woman, who asked that her name not be used, said in court documents that Weinstein arrived uninvited at her hotel on the night in question, forced her to perform oral sex on him and raped her, then threatened her life if she disclosed the attack, according to court documents.
Ring said in a statement Monday that his client "values her privacy, but will do what is necessary to obtain justice for what Weinstein did to her in 2013."
The second woman said she had agreed to meet Weinstein for a business meeting at his Beverly Hills hotel and was unwittingly led into the bathroom of his suite, where a naked Weinstein prevented her from leaving, took down her dress and masturbated as he held her in place by her breast, court papers said.
The Associated Press does not typically identify people who say they have been victims of sexual assault, unless they agree to be named.
The task force is still investigating sex-crime allegations against Weinstein from three women, the district attorney said. Prosecutors said they declined to bring charges involving three other women because the cases were beyond the statute of limitations.
Lacey, along with the two police chiefs, urged other victims to come forward. "We need the voices of all victims to help us remove sexual predators from our community and protect others from these violent crimes," she said.
Weinstein is expected to appear in court in California after his trial in New York is finished, Lacey said. She said prosecutors will recommend $5 million bail.
The district attorney said the timing of the Los Angeles charges was unrelated to the New York trial, explaining that the filing and the announcement came on the first business day on which all the necessary people could be gathered.
Neither woman has stepped forward publicly. But one is expected to testify in the New York case as part of an effort by prosecutors to portray Weinstein as a sexual predator with a habit of forcing himself on young actresses and women trying to break into Hollywood.
The alleged attacks in Los Angeles County came days before the Hollywood producer was photographed on the Oscars red carpet with his fashion designer wife, Georgina Chapman, who was pregnant at the time.
At the 2013 Academy Awards, Weinstein had several major contenders, including "Silver Linings Playbook," "Django Unchained" and "The Master." His movies took home an armful of Oscars, including Jennifer Lawrence's first Academy Award and trophies for director Quentin Tarantino and actor Christoph Waltz.
At the time, the allegations against Weinstein were little more than rumors around Hollywood. When that year's nominees were announced, emcee Seth MacFarlane joked after reading the list of contenders for best supporting actress: "Congratulations, you five ladies no longer have to pretend to be attracted to Harvey Weinstein."
The charges are the first to be brought by the task force in the two years since it was formed. It has investigated more than 20 men, many of them prominent actors and producers, but declined to file charges in nearly all, usually citing statutes of limitations.
Earlier in the day Monday, Weinstein and several of the women who have accused him converged at a New York City courthouse for final preparations for his trial.
Weinstein's attorneys suggested they knew the additional charges might be coming - "There is a potential L.A. situation going on," his lawyer Donna Rotunno told reporters - and asked the judge to sequester the potential jurors to shield them from the news. Judge James Burke refused and also declined to impose a gag order to prevent Weinstein's attorneys from speaking to the media.
Across the street, actresses and other women who say they were sexually harassed or assaulted by Weinstein branded him a villain undeserving of anyone's pity.
"He looked cowardly. He wouldn't look at us. He wouldn't make eye contact," said Sarah Ann Masse, a performer and writer who said Weinstein once sexually harassed her in his underwear during a job interview. "This trial is a cultural reckoning regardless of its legal outcome."
Rotunno said she was hopeful a fair jury could be found: "In this great country, you are innocent until proven guilty."
After a string of successes at Miramax and Weinstein Co. with movies such as "Pulp Fiction" "Shakespeare in Love" and "The King's Speech," the studio boss met his downfall when many of the allegations against him were brought to light by The New York Times and The New Yorker in October 2017.

The Associated Press
DALLAS - The list of items Boeing could be forced to fix before federal safety officials let the grounded 737 Max airliner fly again has grown to include a problem with electrical wiring used for the plane's controls.
Separately on Monday, the financial damage to Boeing from the airplane crisis came into sharper focus as American Airlines said it has reached agreement over compensation from the plane maker for thousands of flights it canceled because its Max jets were grounded most of the year.
American did not say how much it will receive but said it will give $30 million to employees as profit-sharing. American estimated in October that the Max grounding would cost it $540 million in pretax income for all of 2019.
Aeromexico said it too settled with Boeing but declined to release details. The airline has six Max jets.
The wiring issue came to light after the Federal Aviation Administration asked Boeing to audit key systems on the Max after two crashes in which new software and faulty sensors were implicated. During that review of changes Boeing is making to the plane, Boeing discovered that bundles of electrical wiring were too close together and - at least in theory - raised the potential for a short circuit that could cause pilots to lose control of the plane.
"We identified this wiring-bundle issue ... and we are working with the FAA to perform the appropriate analysis," said Boeing spokesman Gordon Johndroe.
The company said, however, it is too soon to know whether it will need to make any design changes, such as moving the wiring bundles farther apart. Boeing says it believes that other safeguards, including circuit breakers and insulation around the wiring, could be sufficient to prevent a short-circuit from leading to another crash.
The discovery of the wiring issue was first reported by The New York Times.
Boeing built and delivered nearly 400 Max jets to airlines before the plane was grounded in March after two crashes that killed 346 people. Since then, another 400 or so Max jets have rolled off the assembly line, although they can't be sent to airlines.
Boeing engineers have finished changes to a key software system called MCAS that was activated by faulty sensors in each crash, firmly pushing the noses of the planes down, a condition called runaway stabilizer.
The recent review of changes to the Max raised the question whether a wiring short circuit could also cause a runaway stabilizer.
Boeing has been working for more than a year to fix MCAS, which was designed partly to prevent the plane from aerodynamic stalls that could cause it to fall from the sky. Boeing is making the system less powerful and linking it to two sensors instead of one for extra protection against the kind of sensor failures that occurred before the crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia.
Separately, in June FAA test pilots were able to cause a failure of flight computers on the Max during a simulator test.
It is unclear when the Max will be cleared to fly. On Monday, FAA spokesman Lynn Lunsford repeated the agency's position that it has no timetable for reviewing the plane. He said the FAA and Boeing are analyzing findings from the recent review of Boeing's changes to the plane, and "the agency will ensure that all safety related issues identified during this process are addressed before the aircraft is approved for return to passenger service."
The FAA has not yet decided whether to require that Max pilots train on flight simulators before carrying passengers. That would cause another long delay in the plane's return. For one thing, there are only a handful of Max simulators, while Southwest has nearly 10,000 pilots who fly the Max and other versions of the 737; American has 4,200.
Southwest Airlines, which has 34 Max planes, the most of any carrier, announced last month that it reached a deal on partial compensation from Boeing and will share $125 million of the undisclosed amount with employees. United Airlines has not announced a settlement.
Before the grounding, the Max was Boeing's best-selling plane, with nearly 5,000 unfilled orders. However, Boeing will stop production temporarily in mid-January, affecting about 3,000 employees in the Seattle area. On Monday, the company began notifying them whether they will move or change jobs. Boeing promises to avoid layoffs or furloughs.
The crisis cost former Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg his job. He was ousted last month and will be replaced next week by David Calhoun, a private-equity executive who once ran General Electric's jet-engine business and has served on Boeing's board since 2009, most recently as chairman.

Texto completo: Federal investigators said Monday a packed bus passed a truck on the Pennsylvania Turnpike shortly before losing control and causing a chain-reaction wreck that killed five and injured dozens.
An initial report about the facts should be out in about 10 days, but it could be up to two years before the 3:30 a.m. Sunday crash is fully analysed, National Transportation Safety Board member Jennifer Homendy told reporters.
“I thought it was devastating,” Homendy said after reviewing evidence. “I imagine that if you were in this accident, that it was scary.”
She said the motor coach began its trip at 10 p.m. Saturday in Queens, New York, then stopped in Manhattan and Hackensack, New Jersey. She said driver Shuang Qing Feng, 58, was about 10 miles (16 kilometers) from being subbed out by the next driver when his bus passed a FedEx truck.
“Down the road” the driver lost control and the bus hit a concrete median barrier, went up an embankment and ended up blocking the westbound turnpike travel lanes, she said. The FedEx truck could not stop and hit the bus, after which a UPS truck also struck it.
Lamar Brady, of Columbus, Ohio, said he was awake in a window seat on the right side of the bus and saw the crash occur. Brady told Ohio reporters that it seemed to him the bus driver was traveling too fast as the bus moved to pass a slower-moving FedEx tractor-trailer and then lost control and struck the embankment.
“I keep seeing the accident unfold in my head,” Brady, 21, told The Columbus Dispatch as he rode another bus home.
Homendy said she does not know if the bus was speeding, but state police have recovered an engine control module that may provide details and investigators hope another vehicle's outward-facing camera recorded relevant footage.
The road was resurfaced last year and was in good condition, she said.
The bus carrying 56 passengers was headed to Cincinnati and then Louisville before it would have returned to Queens, Homendy said.
The driver was thrown from the bus and died at the scene on Interstate 76 in a mountainous and rural area about 30 miles (50 kilometers) west of Pittsburgh.
The great majority of all vehicle crashes involve some sort of driver behavior, said Christopher Turner, director of crash and data programs for the Commercial Vehicle Safety Alliance.
“This is not a typical incident - buses overturning is not a common occurrence," Turner said. “But obviously the risk is tremendous.”
State police said the motor coach was operated by Z&D Tour Inc. of Rockaway, New Jersey. Several calls seeking comment from the bus company and its owner were not returned.
But Z&D owner Chen Dan Yu told The New York Times that weather was to blame. “It suddenly started to snow,” he said.
Mount Pleasant Township Fire Chief Jerry Lucia, among the first to arrive at the scene, encountered dazed victims who had already been able to get out of the wreckage. The road was wet after being treated with road salt following about an inch of snow some four or five hours earlier, he said.
“My rescue engine was on the scene right before me,” Lucia said Monday. “When they got out of their vehicle they came upon 40-some people standing along the road with no shoes on, freezing cold.”
Lucia said he thinks many of the passengers had been asleep.
“They were all together,” Lucia said. “They were helping each other to keep calm and cool and collected.”
Many, if not most, did not speak English, he said. Rescue crews assembled them about 50 feet away from the crash, and medics began treating the wounded, getting the most seriously injured into ambulances. Because the crash had shut down the turnpike, emergency crews had to drive the wrong way down 5 miles of highway to reach the scene.
Turnpike officials shut down the highway and took out a section of guardrail so that westbound vehicles could be turned back east for eventual exit, Lucia said. Fire crews worked to contain spilled diesel fuel, he said. One firefighter injured an ankle while searching the wreckage for victims.
The injured flooded nearby hospitals with patients. Authorities have said all patients are expected to survive.
It was some 13 hours after the crash before the eastbound lanes could be reopened.
Feng and two other victims are from New York City: passengers Eileen Zelis Aria, 35, and 9-year-old Jaremy Vazquez, according to the Westmoreland County coroner's office.
Two UPS employees were killed, Daniel Kepner, 53, and Dennis Kehler, 48.

Letter: Stand with police, not protesters

Texto completo: Once again Yale University has failed to man up when its police officers have come under unfair criticism and discipline. Four years ago when New York Times columnist Charles Blow used his position as a bully pulpit to unfairly criticize the Yale police department for their “treatment” of his son whose description closely matched that of a wanted felon, the university remained silent.
Now the university is kowtowing to a narrow-minded “social justice organizer” and her minions by exacting humiliating punishment upon Officer Terrance Pollock.
Officer Pollock received a report of armed robbery suspects located in the area and responded to assist a Hamden officer. Upon his arrival, his cruiser was hit by bullets and his leg was grazed by the gunfire. Assuming that the suspects had engaged the other officer he fired three shots in support. Little did he know that the bullets that were fired at him came from the other officer’s gun.
The state’s attorney’s office determined that Officer Pollock “did not injure the occupants of the car” and his actions were “objectively reasonable and thereby justified.”
So what does Yale do? They conduct an administrative review taking into consideration the state’s attorney’s findings (see above) and his 17 years of service and suspend him for 30 days without pay and reassign him to an administrative capacity without uniform or gun! This because of a social justice organizer who is blind to the facts?
Putting officers on the front line and not supporting them could cause them to think twice about the consequences of their situation and that hesitation could cost them their lives.
Yale needs to stand behind their employees and not cave to narrow-minded protesters.

Texto completo: President Donald Trump’s frequent diatribes calling the media “fake news” is provocative and denigrating, but the journalists who co-founded the Axios and Politico news organizations said Monday they believe the bashing is bogus and for show.
The two, Mike Allen and Jim VandeHei, made the assertion during a luncheon talk hosted by the Forum Club of the Palm Beaches.
“There's this idea that the president promotes that he hates the press, and that he's always hated the media,” said Allen, who claimed that his and VandeHei’s experiences debunk the authenticity of the president’s media hatred.
“As Jim will tell you from our personal experience: couldn't be less true,” Allen said, likening the farce to a dramatic yet heavily produced professional wrestling match. He added: “The idea of hating the press, the idea of the press is the enemy, there’s very much a WWE, WWF dimension to that.”
He then told the crowd of more than 600 at the Kravis Center: “The only thing that the president likes better than news shows or shows that are talking about him, are tapes of himself.”
VandeHei agreed, saying that immediately following a rally, Trump will sit back on Air Force One and watch videos of himself.
“He will re-watch, almost like a sports telecaster, his own performance,” he said.
Allen also implied the president, deep down, values the press and has adeptly leveraged the media to advance his career and ambitions.
“The president will talk onstage about the fake, failing New York Times, he’ll walk off the stage and give an interview to (Times reporter) Maggie Haberman,” he said. “One of the ways he built his name, built his fortune, was courting the media.”
Coincidentally, Haberman, who won a Pulitzer Prize in 2018, was in the press pool that covered the president’s stay at Mar-a-Lago this weekend.
Allen called Trump a “student of the media,” because the president makes it a habit to watch the Sunday news shows, even texting people like Chris Christie right after interviews air to critique the performance.
Sure enough, the president — to a limited extent — confirmed Allen’s and VandeHei’s hypothesis last week while at the Southern White House.
Entering his New Year’s Eve gala at Mar-a-Lago, the president turned heads from the red carpet when he called the assembled journalists “honorable people.”
“I want to thank everybody. I want you to have a great year. Look, you’re honorable people,” he said with first lady Melania Trump at his side. “You have to stay honorable. If you’re honorable, I’m going to win the election by a lot. If you’re not honorable, I’m just going to win the election by a little. So, I’d rather have you be honorable, OK?”
Journalists present say they believe the kudos were spoken with an air of jest, however, not a new revelation or concealed appreciation for the Fourth Estate.
After all, Trump has publicly spewed anti-media vitriol on a seemingly routine basis during his administration. He has called the media the “enemy of the people” and has tweeted and re-tweeted memes and other social media that make light of violence toward the press.
His media-bashing was on display during his 17-day holiday visit that concluded on Sunday.
“I went to NATO and they weren’t carrying their weight. They weren’t putting up the money,” Trump told thousands of conservative high school and college students at the Turning Point USA conference in West Palm Beach Dec. 21.
“The press didn’t want to talk about it. But there — oh, that’s a lot of press back there. The fake news, yeah,” the president said to loud boos from the crowd.
The reaction spurred him on.
“It’s a lot of press. It’s always a lot of press. You know, with these guys, you can speak for weeks; if you make one little misstatement, they go after you. Because you know why? They’re fake news,” Trump said, later adding: “The media is a wing of the Democrat Party.”
Just days after calling the press honorable on New Year’s Eve, the president was at a rally for evangelicals at a megachurch in Miami when he encouraged thousands to turn and shout at dozens of assembled media corralled on risers.
“Very dishonest people, but maybe they’ll be more honest in this great church,” he said at another point in the Jan. 3 speech. “Do you think, pastor, do you think they’ll be a little bit more honest in this church? Maybe we’ll get a good shake from the media, but I doubt it.”
After boos from the crowd, the president spoke about those he most respected in the media, including conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh, Fox News personality Sean Hannity and the anchors on morning program “Fox & Friends,” before reflecting on his 2016 victory, which he boasted was accomplished without media support.
“If you’re a little, tiny bit off, they have headlines ‘Trump lied,’” he said, to laughter. “I don’t think I lied. Most of this, I could argue with them, just a little, but they never argue with me. This was truly one of the great, maybe the great election, of not our times, of all times.”

Author goes viral with anti-Trump quote that's not actually a quote at all

Texto completo: Author and former New Yorker columnist Kurt Andersen scored a viral anti-Trump hit this weekend by fabricating a quote and attributing it to the New York Times.

Andersen tweeted this weekend to his more than 68,000 followers: “@NYTimes: ‘Officials presented the president with options. The Pentagon tacked on the choice of targeting [Qassem Soleimani] mainly to make other options seem reasonable. They didn’t think he would take it. When Mr. Trump chose the option, military officials, flabbergasted, were alarmed.’”Tweet Note the use of the colon and the quotation marks. To anyone with a basic understanding of the English language, Andersen’s tweet is clear: The Times reported those exact words in that exact order. Andersen is just quoting an article he read. Except he is not.
Andersen’s tweet, which is still live and has been shared by nearly 10,000 social media users, is a mishmash of sentences plucked selectively from a Times article and Frankensteined into something more hideous than its original form.

The part of Andersen’s tweet where it says “officials presented the president with options,” for example, comes from a passage that actually reads:
Officials presented the president with an initial list of options for how to deal with escalating violence against American targets in Iraq. The options included strikes on Iranian ships or missile facilities or against Iranian-backed militia groups in Iraq. The Pentagon also tacked on the choice of targeting General Suleimani, mainly to make other options seem reasonable.
Of the options presented to the president, he chose “strikes against militia groups,” according to the Times. It was not until later, during the attacks on the U.S. Embassy in Iraq, that the president opted to escalate and go after Soleimani directly. The part of Andersen’s tweet where it says “they didn’t think he would take it,” does indeed refer to the option of killing Soleimani. It also refers to the period before the attacks on U.S. soil. It also comes from an entirely separate section of the Times report.
Lastly, the part where Andersen refers to U.S. officials being “alarmed” comes from a section of the report where it states specifically that officials were “alarmed” by the “prospect of Iranian retaliatory strikes on American troops in the region.”
In other words, Andersen lied. He selected his favorite parts, his favorite individual words within the Times article, stitched them together into an especially ugly and misleading quilt, and then presented his handiwork on social media for retweets and likes.

Amazingly, even after a Twitter user, Neontaster, discredited Andersen’s “quote,” the former New Yorker editor defended his viral fabrication.

“The 280-character condensation of the article to its astonishing gist is entirely accurate,” Andersen said.

This professional author, one who used to work for the New Yorker, knows exactly how quotation marks work. He even knows what an ellipsis is. Andersen’s choice to forgo the writing tools readily available at his fingertips was intentional. He can pretend he does not understand how punctuation works, but no one is stupid enough to buy that.
And even without the misleading punctuation, his summary would not be accurate. The options were not presented to Trump as he implied they were. Officials were not "alarmed" about what he said they were alarmed by. Events did not take place in the order he implied.

For an industry whose members constantly complain about the spread of disinformation, self-policing among journalists is exceedingly thin. There are no articles in Poynter, Nieman Labs, or the New York Times warning of the abundance of falsehoods attributable to members of the press. No CNN reporters or Daily Beast contributors are cautioning their followers to be wary of viral posts produced by members of their own industry.

Those concerns are reserved exclusively for the real threat to the republic: the satirical Babylon Bee.

Trump's strike on Qassem Soleimani did put 'America First'

Texto completo: "America First" was always more of a campaign slogan than a strategy. But if the Trump doctrine has materialized in any coherent way, it's a reflexive rejection of the hawkish foreign policy of the Republican Party's recent past.
President Trump controversially attempted to pull American forces out of Syria, tolerated Russian protection of Venezuelan dictator Nicolas Maduro, and let Kim Jong Un waffle on weapon agreements. "America First" points to a less interventionist ideal.
But what it does not mean and what it has never meant is that the administration would tolerate foreign adversaries violently attacking American citizens and sovereign U.S. territory.
A straight news profile by the New York Times on Fox News's Pete Hegseth tries to insinuate otherwise. Hegseth's support for Trump's order to kill Qassem Soleimani, the Times headline argues, constitutes an "exception" from his allegiance to the "America First" principle.
"Mr. Hegseth’s rallying around Mr. Trump’s order to attack General Suleimani has turned off some opponents of the 'forever wars' who see opportunism," Jennifer Steinhauer writes. "Voices like Tucker Carlson, another Fox host who has become strongly antiwar, and Concerned Veterans for America, a conservative group that Mr. Hegseth once led, have remained true to their war fatigue. Not Mr. Hegseth."
The Times's framing is not unique, but rather a distillation of a flawed refrain echoed by Trump's critics in the past week. They fail to understand that his Soleimani strike was the embodiment of "America First," not an abandonment of it.
Two weekends ago, Trump's detractors thought themselves clever when they branded the Iranian-backed assault on the American embassy in Baghdad as his "Benghazi." They now seem surprised that Trump, unlike Obama, wasted no time in holding the plotters of this and other attacks on U.S. soil directly responsible.
Soleimani was an enemy combatant in uniform, reportedly behind violent attacks against American interests within Iraq, where U.S. troops have already been legally authorized to occupy.
Many people, myself included, have argued against Trump's failures to acknowledge and prioritize our national interests in Syria. But in the case of Iranian aggression, there was no ambiguity for Trump's supporters or for his more hawkish critics. For some time now, Iran has been ratcheting up attacks on American and Western interests abroad. It has attacked U.S. military and British civilian vessels at sea, and this recent attack on our U.S embassy is only the latest example. But there is a long history of this, and (for those tempted to argue that Iran poses no threat to us here) it involves plots against our homeland. Soleimani is suspected of involvement in the 2011 assassination plot against the Saudi ambassador in Washington, D.C.
Trump's intentionally disproportionate response, in this case, makes clear that there will be a cost to such violent acts and violent schemes.
If responding to a slap with a punch can't serve as an example of "America First," then I don't know what could.

Fidel Castro and Mao Zedong got nicer obituaries from New York Times than late NFL coach

Texto completo: Mao Zedong and Fidel Castro got friendlier obituaries in the New York Times than the NFL coach who took the Cincinnati Bengals to Super Bowl XXIII.

I guess that makes sense. After all, say what you will about the men whose genocidal actions killed literally millions of people, but at least Castro and Chairman Mao never barred a female sports reporter from a men’s locker room.

“Sam Wyche, who led Cincinnati to the Super Bowl, dies at 74,” reads the headline to the obituary the New York Times published this week.

The subhead then adds of the late NFL coach: “He was praised as a hard-driving coach willing to go against the grain. He was also fined for keeping a female reporter out of the team’s locker room.”
The first paragraph of the New York Times' Wyche obituary is also keen to remind readers that the late coach was a problematic person.

“Sam Wyche, who was the last coach to lead the Cincinnati Bengals to the Super Bowl, but who was later fined by the National Football League for barring a female reporter from the team’s locker room, died on Thursday at his home in Pickens, S.C. He was 74,” it reads.
As it turns out, some journalists will try to cancel a guy even after he is dead.
Tweet
The issue here is not that the Wyche obituary goes straight into highlighting what the author believes is a problematic chapter in the coach’s impressive career. Supposedly unflattering details are fair game. The problem is that the New York Times has a bizarre history of selectively praising and condemning the recently departed, emphasizing supposed transgressions for some while ignoring actual war crimes for others. Just look at how the same news organization marked the deaths of Castro and Mao.

“Fidel Castro, the Cuban revolutionary who defied the U.S., died Friday. He was 90,” reads the headline to the New York Times’ Nov. 26, 2016, obituary for the Cuban tyrant.

The article's opening lines state, “Fidel Castro, the fiery apostle of revolution who brought the Cold War to the Western Hemisphere in 1959 and then defied the United States for nearly half a century as Cuba’s maximum leader, bedeviling 11 American presidents and briefly pushing the world to the brink of nuclear war, died on Friday. He was 90.”
Tweet
Earlier, on Sept. 10, 1976, the New York Times published an obituary for Mao, titled simply, “Mao Tse‐tung: Father of Chinese revolution."

"Mao Tse‐tung, who began as an obscure peasant, died one of history's great revolutionary figures," the opening line reads.

The obituary's opening paragraph adds (and I promise you I am not making any of this up):
"Born at a time when China was wracked by civil strife, beset with terrible poverty and encroached on by more advanced foreign powers, he lived to fulfill his boyhood dream of restoring it to its traditional place as a great nation. In Chinese terms, he ranked with Chin Shih‐huang, the first Emperor, who unified China in 221 B.C., and was the man Chairman Mao most liked to compare himself to."
No mentions of Cuban death squads, mass executions, man-made famines, or gulags in the opening paragraphs to the Castro and Mao obituaries. No mention of the disastrous and fatal Great Leap Forward. No mention of the great evils they unleashed on the world. No mention of their literally millions of victims. Just glowing hagiographies and larger-than-life characterizations.

But Wyche? Well, he is problematic. The defining moment of his career was when he kept a female reporter out of a room where male football players dress.

In case the point is not clear enough, consider this: Six hours before the New York Times shared its Wyche obituary on social media, it shared one for an Iranian terrorist titled, “Qassim Suleimani, master of Iran’s intrigue and force, dies at 62.”

Look, I am not saying you have to murder a lot of people to get a glowing obituary from the New York Times. But it probably helps.

2020 DEMOCRATS POISED FOR TOUGH ACTIONS ON VAPING: Democrats vying to defeat President Trump in November say they’re prepared to take far more aggressive actions against e-cigarettes than the Trump administration has.
Last week, the White House announced it would be banning all flavored e-cigarettes, with the exception of tobacco and menthol, and that it would also allow “open tank” products to remain on the market. The announcement received criticism from public health groups, who want menthol banned and want all products to undergo review by the Food and Drug Administration before they’re allowed to be sold.
But Trump backed off harsher regulations after seeing data about how they might lower his re-election chances.
Joe Biden said recently that there must be “serious scientific data as to whether or not it has the kind of long-term damage on the lungs and it causes death before we allow it to be sold,” according to Bloomberg.
The conservative Americans for Tax Reform also posted a video of Biden saying that if studies show that the products damage the lungs then he would “eliminate” the products and “go after it in a hard way. I would make it broader, not just where [Trump] is.” “I choose science over fiction,” Biden said. “And so if the science has demonstrated is doing great damage then I don't care what it does to a small business person who's selling this stuff.”
Bernie Sanders said he would “shut down” the industry, according to Politico, but then his adviser walked the comments back. Sanders had said the answer was to “shut down the industry if they’re causing addiction and if the evidence is that people are getting sick as a result or inhaling a lot of bad stuff.” After that, adviser Jeff Weaver told Politico that Sanders was not talking about immediately shutting down the industry, but would want more studies and regulations to make sure e-cigarettes are safe. Note that there was decades of data on traditional cigarette use before the government cracked down on smoking.
We’ll be watching to see how other candidates respond to similar questions, but a couple have given indications based on their actions in Congress. In the Senate, Elizabeth Warren has called on the FDA to review the products, which the industry equates to a ban because smaller manufacturers say they don’t have the financial wherewithal to undergo review. Amy Klobuchar slammed Trump back in November when it became clear the administration wouldn’t be enacting the crackdown it previously promised, calling it “yet another example of how his administration prioritizes corporate interests over people.”

MEDICAL DEBT ABSENT FROM WARREN BANKRUPTCY PLAN: The 2020 Democratic contender’s list of ways to help families who go broke doesn’t include any mention of helping people get out of medical debt.
This is notable because when Warren was a professor she co-authored an academic paper in 2005 that claimed more than 40% of all bankruptcies in America were a result of medical problems. That study has been widely debunked, given that other factors besides medical costs, such as job loss during treatment for a serious illness or falling behind on payments, tend to be larger factors. But the figure was cited by a lot of politicians who sought to expand health insurance across the U.S. Now, Warren’s rhetoric on the issue appears to have changed. In her plan she writes that data show “nearly 90% of these families were declaring bankruptcy for one of three reasons: a job loss, a medical problem, or a family breakup.”
NEW INNOVATION CENTER CHIEF HAS BACKGROUND OFFERING SERVICES TO PATIENTS LIKELY TO DIE: The Trump administration announced Monday that Brad Smith will take the reins at the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation, an agency created by Obamacare that tries different healthcare payment arrangements to save money and improve patient outcomes.
The nomination, which doesn’t require congressional confirmation, was expected, and we’ll be watching to see whether there’s any backlash. Smith, 36, co-founded and oversaw a Nashville-based startup called Aspire Health that offered services to patients who were likely to die. The company uses algorithms to identify patients with serious medical conditions, many of whom have only a year to live, and helps those who don't want intensive medical care to get palliative care, which helps people relieve suffering at home until they die or recover.
SCOTUS ASKS ANTI-OBAMACARE STATES TO RESPOND TO PETITION: The Supreme Court is giving red states and the Trump administration until Friday afternoon to respond to a petition from blue states asking the justices to quickly take up the Texas v. Azar case, which has the potential to throw out the entire healthcare law. The Supreme Court is considering whether to take it up this term, before the lower courts litigate on it. If they do, it would cause a decision on Obamacare’s future to land just ahead of the 2020 election.
PLANNED PARENTHOOD PERFORMED NEARLY 13,000 MORE ABORTIONS IN LATEST FISCAL YEAR: Planned Parenthood’s annual report published last week revealed that the organization performed 345,672 abortions in its latest fiscal year, a 12,915 jump from the previous year, even though the group’s been facing pressure from the Trump administration and Republicans.
Financial support is down: Overall, the organization’s revenues decreased by about $17.5 million, to $1.4 billion. The decrease is largely due to a lower number of individual financial contributors, which have dropped significantly by about 400,000 from the year before.
FATHERS NEED CHANGING TABLES TOO: Dads-turned-advocates are fighting for wider efforts to install diaper changing tables in men’s restrooms, especially as more men take on greater responsibility in caring for children. In this week’s Washington Examiner magazine, Kimberly writes about fathers who are tired of changing their children’s diapers on bathroom floors, counters, and in some cases, on their laps. Read more here.
CASSIDY (THE LOUISIANA SENATOR) DEMANDS IMPROVED DISABILITIES ACCOMMODATIONS FOR MCAT TEST TAKERS: Republican Senator Bill Cassidy urged the Association of American Medical Colleges to improve practices for accommodating students who have learning disabilities, such as dyslexia, who take the MCAT. While about 14% of students have a learning disability, Cassidy wrote only 0.3% of MCAT test takers received accommodations for a disability.
NURSES HIGHEST RATED FOR ETHICS AND HONEST, LEAVING MEMBERS OF CONGRESS IN THE DUST: A Gallup survey found that 85% of the public find nurses to be the most honest and ethical professionals in 2019 for the fourth year in a row. Members of Congress, on the other hand, were second to last when it came to both criteria, with 12% of the public’s support. They ranked just above car salespeople in last place, and have maintained their ranking on the list for the past three years. But at least they’re consistent. That counts for something, right?

Top Facebook executive admits he 'desperately' wants Trump to lose but wants company to play fair

Texto completo: Andrew Bosworth, Facebook's head of virtual and augmented reality, said he wants President Trump to lose the 2020 presidential election, but that Facebook should not help stop him from winning.
"I find myself desperately wanting to pull any lever at my disposal to avoid the same result," Bosworth said about Trump's election in a Dec. 30 company memo obtained by the New York Times. "So what stays my hand? I find myself thinking of the Lord of the Rings at this moment. Specifically, when Frodo offers the Ring to Galadriel and she imagines using the power righteously, at first, but knows it will eventually corrupt her."
"As tempting as it is to use the tools available to us to change the outcome, I am confident we must never do that or we will become that which we fear," the executive added in the 2,500-word memo titled "Thoughts for 2020." Bosworth admitted that Facebook's current guidelines "very well may lead to" the reelection of Trump.
A spokeswoman for Facebook said Bosworth's post was not "written for public consumption." She added that the executive "hoped this post would encourage my co-workers to continue to accept criticism with grace as we accept the responsibility we have overseeing our platform."
The comments come as Democratic lawmakers expressed outrage at the platform for not doing better regulating political ads, a criticism even some Facebook employees have shared.
More than 250 Facebook employees sent a letter to CEO Mark Zuckerberg in October asking the company to do more to police ads. “Free speech and paid speech are not the same thing. Misinformation affects us all,” the workers said in the letter. “Our current policies on fact-checking people in political office, or those running for office, are a threat to what FB stands for.”

Bloomberg buys Super Bowl commercial slot for about $10 million

Texto completo: Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg bought a 60-second advertising slot during next month's Super Bowl. The commercial slot will likely cost approximately $10 million.
The Bloomberg campaign confirmed they bought the airtime and told the New York Times that they paid "market rate" for it. Fox executives previously revealed that they had sold all of their available commercial time for the Super Bowl broadcast with a 30-second ad costing "north of $5 million" but not exceeding $5.6 million, Variety reported in November.
“The biggest point is getting under Trump’s skin,” said Michael Frazier, a spokesman for the Bloomberg campaign. “We have the means to raise a national campaign unlike any other candidate.” They also said that the ad would directly attack the president as opposed to highlighting Bloomberg himself.
Super Bowl ads will also be at a premium during the 2020 Super Bowl because Fox has already announced that they intend to cut out one commercial break each quarter.
[Previous coverage: Michael Bloomberg set to spend more in one week on TV ad blitz than any candidate ever]
Bloomberg's campaign strategy is predicated on running ads while speaking the first four crowded early state nominating contests that take place in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina. He spends approximately $4.2 million on campaign ads per day.
His campaign-to-date and planned spending on television, Facebook, and Google from Nov. 25 through Dec. 22 is $117.8 million. The sum on ads alone is nearly as much as the $130.7 million that former Vice President Joe Biden, Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, and former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg spent combined on their entire campaigns, from their campaign launches through the end of September.

Warren revives clash with Biden over landmark 2005 bankruptcy bill with new reform plan

Texto completo: Elizabeth Warren released a proposal Tuesday to overhaul the country's personal bankruptcy laws, pitting herself against rival Joe Biden by taking aim at landmark legislation from 2005 that he supported and she opposed.
The Massachusetts senator's plan is meant to make it easier for Americans who are in debt to get relief through bankruptcy.
“Thanks in part to the 2005 bankruptcy bill, our current system makes it far too hard for people in need to start the bankruptcy process so they can get back on their feet,” Warren wrote in her plan, which does not directly name Biden but makes extensive reference to the bill he supported.
Warren, then a Harvard law professor, vigorously opposed the 2005 bankruptcy bill that Biden, as a Delaware senator, fought hard to pass because it benefited his home state. The 2005 legislation, in general, made it easier for creditors to collect and more onerous and expensive for individuals to get out of their debts. This would benefit many of the credit card companies that Biden has long been accused of cozying up to.
Immediately after Biden entered the presidential race in April 2019, Warren accused him of having been on the “side of the credit card companies.”
“Our disagreement is a matter of public record,” she said at the time.
Warren admitted in her plan that she "lost that fight in 2005, and working families paid the price." However, she added that she "didn’t stop fighting to hold the financial industry accountable," referring to her instrumental role in creating the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the federal agency responsible for consumer protection in the financial sector, founded in 2011 after the 2008 financial crisis.

Bernie Sanders isn't a joke — he's dangerous

Texto completo: Pundits wrote off Sen. Bernie Sanders’s campaign back in October after his heart attack evoked the risks of nominating a candidate who would turn 80 during the first year of his presidency.
But since then, Sanders has made a remarkable comeback — and not just in terms of his health. Having climbed to second place nationally and raised a whopping $34.5 million in the fourth quarter, he now finds himself leading in New Hampshire and tied for first place in Iowa, according to the latest CBS/YouGov poll.
Perhaps Joe Biden, who enjoys much stronger support among black voters, is still in a better position to win the Democratic nomination. But Sanders’s candidacy is for real, and that means he must be taken seriously.
Were a major political party to nominate an avowed socialist as its candidate for the White House, it would be a monumental event in the nation’s history. Sanders is not merely an amusing old crank but rather an advocate for truly dangerous ideas that have caused great violence, suffering, and deprivation of freedom throughout the world. And although he has mostly stopped apologizing for communist tyrants, his policy recommendations evince the same lack of judgment he showed in the days when he did so routinely.
Even as a mere mayor in the 1980s, Sanders made a point of inserting himself into international affairs to make excuses for communist dictators. This includes the late Fidel Castro, whom Sanders routinely praised and defended. Today, even Castro’s death has not ended the country's pointless regime or its continued, senseless repression of Cubans, who are barred even from accessing the internet. Despite what Sanders and other apologists say, this lack of openness is not just a defect of that regime similar to the defects of capitalism. Rather, the repression and lack of openness are communism's defining features.
In 1985, Sanders became, by his own reckoning, the highest-ranking elected U.S. official to visit Managua and celebrate the anniversary of Nicaragua’s authoritarian Marxist regime. Participants at a rally he attended cheered, “Here, there, everywhere, the Yankee will die!” By that time, Sanders was in denial about the Sandinistas’ documented atrocities, which had been mentioned in several U.S. publications, including a Time magazine feature on Jan. 24, 1983. Insider testimony and other evidence detailed the Sandinistas’ thousands of rapes, routine disappearances of citizens, and persecution of indigenous populations who were forcibly relocated or forced to flee the country by the thousands.
Yet Sanders would insist that Nicaragua’s Marxist dictatorship was the victim of a White House and media conspiracy. “When you read the New York Times,” he said, referring to their reporting at the time on Nicaragua, “the real truth is not being told.”
Today, Sanders no longer points to Nicaragua or Cuba as models, and he acknowledges that “the Soviet Union was an authoritarian dictatorship," saying, "that’s what I believed then, and that’s what I believe the case to be today.”
Even at the time he visited the USSR on his honeymoon in 1988 amid Mikhail Gorbachev’s liberalization, Sanders admitted that its system was undemocratic and forbade dissent. He also acknowledged that it had produced subpar outcomes in housing and healthcare.
Yet he praised the Soviet system anyway, pointing out that the Soviets at least provided housing and healthcare for free. Apparently, he was unable to connect these dots. Quality housing and healthcare cost money. Any system that relies on the government to depress prices artificially — to frustrate market signals about what things are worth and to give people something for nothing — will be characterized by corner-cutting and shoddy, subpar outcomes.
This helps illustrate Sanders’s backward ideas about economics, ideas that have prompted him to praise bread lines as a sign of societal compassion and to condemn excessive consumer choices of deodorant as a sign of misplaced priorities.
This brings us to Sanders’s $34 trillion socialized health insurance plan. It would eliminate all private insurance and offer free government coverage in its stead, with no deductibles, premiums, or copays — plus dental and vision benefits. This is far more ambitious than even Canada's single-payer system, as two-thirds of Canadians purchase supplemental private insurance to offer benefits not covered by their public system, including prescription drugs and dental and vision coverage.
Sanders’s system won’t work. And it will cost even more than $34 trillion unless doctors and providers simply agree to work for less.
Sanders has a raft of big plans, and on every issue, he has staked out a position as far to his left as possible. This includes a $4.35 trillion wealth tax (significantly larger than that proposed by Elizabeth Warren) and the abrupt elimination of all $1.6 trillion of student debt.
Americans may not be clamoring for socialism, but right now, Sanders has a chance of winning a major party's nomination, and in a two-party system, each major party candidate starts off with a decent chance of winning. His emergence should not be dismissed as an idle threat.

Texto completo: Linda Poskanzer was having a tough time in her late 60s.
“I was not doing well emotionally,” she recalled. “Physically, I didn’t have any stamina. I was sleeping a lot. I wasn’t getting to work.”
A therapist in Hackensack, New Jersey, Poskanzer was severely overweight and grew short of breath after walking even short distances. Her house had become disorganized, buried in unsorted paperwork. The antidepressant she was taking didn’t seem to help.
Her son, visiting from Florida, called his sisters and said, “Mommy needs an intervention.”
One of her daughters made an appointment with a geriatrician — a physician who specializes in the care of older adults. Dr. Manisha Parulekar, now chief of geriatrics at Hackensack University Medical Center, suggested her new patient take action on several fronts. She arranged for a sleep study, which found that Poskanzer suffered from apnea. She prescribed a different antidepressant and physical therapy in a pool to help rebuild her stamina.
And weight loss. Eventually, the geriatrician agreed that bariatric surgery made sense. Over nine months, Poskanzer lost 75 pounds; she has shed another 15 since.
Now about to turn 80, Poskanzer is still receiving therapy, 30 hours each week, feels “full of spirit” and continues to see her geriatrician every four months. “She sits and talks, which a lot of doctors don’t do anymore,” Poskanzer said. “And she knows me. I feel very well taken care of.”
Testimonials like this spotlight the rising need for geriatricians. These doctors not only monitor and coordinate treatment for the many ailments, disabilities and medications their patients contend with, but also help them determine what’s most important for their well-being and quality of life.
Patients like Poskanzer often can’t easily find geriatricians like Parulekar, however. As the nation’s older population surges, the gap between need and supply has steadily widened, and a persistent shortage of geriatricians has troubled the medical profession for years.
Geriatrics became a board-certified medical specialty only in 1988. An analysis published in 2018 showed that over 16 years, through the academic year 2017-18, the number of graduate fellowship programs that train geriatricians, underwritten by Medicare, increased to 210 from 182. That represents virtually no growth when adjusted for the rising U.S. population. “It’s basically stagnation,” said Aldis Petriceks, the study’s lead author, now a medical student at Harvard.
Moreover, geriatrics fails to attract enough young doctors to the graduate fellowships it does offer. Leaving aside geriatric psychiatry, more than a third of 384 slots went unfilled last year, the American Geriatrics Society reports.
If one geriatrician can care for 700 patients with complex medical needs, as a federal model estimates, the nation will need 33,200 such doctors in 2025. It has about 7,000, only half of them practicing full time.
Why do so few residents choose to specialize in geriatrics? Though salaries are rising, total compensation (wages along with certain benefits) for geriatricians in 2018 averaged $233,564, according to the Medical Group Management Association. Anesthesiologists earned twice as much; radiologists and cardiologists topped $500,000.
“These are smart people looking at economic reality,” said Dr. Mark Supiano, a geriatrician and researcher at VA Salt Lake City Health Care System. Treating patients covered by Medicare, which pays less than commercial insurance, is a slow way to repay medical school loans.
Nor does the field offer much glamour or the prospect of medical heroics. “Having patience, having good communication skills, it’s a different personality than being a surgeon,” Supiano acknowledged. Yet a much-cited 2009 survey of 42 medical specialties found that geriatricians reported higher career satisfaction than most.
Not every older person needs a geriatrician, but the federal model estimates that 30% of the over-65 population does. This is especially true “when someone has three or more chronic conditions and is over 85,” said Nancy Lundebjerg, chief executive of the American Geriatrics Society.
That describes Dorothy Lakin, 93, whose recent medical history includes heart failure, macular degeneration, falls, colon cancer and heart valve surgeries, and a stroke.
“She’s had a zillion trips to the ER, one after another,” said her daughter Mary Ellen Lakin, 70, who lives in Newton, Massachusetts. “I thought, ‘Let’s see if there’s a way to make her life easier.’”
Mary Ellen Lakin found her way to Dr. Laura Nelson Frain, a geriatrician at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, who has gently steered mother and daughter through the past year. She reduced the number of medications Dorothy Lakin took and the specialists she saw, stayed in touch with Mary Ellen and sent a geriatric nurse-practitioner to make house calls.
“It’s less of ‘Let’s order this med, let’s order that procedure,’ more of a holistic approach,” Mary Ellen Lakin said. Her mother recently entered hospice care.
Still, given the numbers, “we’re not going to address this growing older population through some miraculous influx of specialized geriatricians,” Petriceks said.
Leaders in geriatrics agree, and while they continue working to bolster their numbers, they’re also adopting other strategies. Dr. Mary Tinetti, chief of geriatrics at the Yale School of Medicine, has called for geriatricians to serve as “a small, elite workforce” who help train whole institutions in the specifics of care for older adults.
“The most important thing geriatricians can do is make sure all their other colleagues” understand these patients’ needs, she said, including nurse-practitioners, physician assistants and pharmacists.
To some extent, this is already happening. Medical associations representing cardiologists and oncologists have begun focusing on older patients, Lundebjerg pointed out. Health systems are adopting age-friendly approaches, like specialized emergency rooms. The American College of Surgeons’ new verification program sets standards hospitals should meet to improve results for older patients.
Last month the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions voted to reauthorize a $41 million program that educates health professionals in geriatrics; it awaits a floor vote. A companion bill has already passed the House of Representatives. “It’s money very well spent,” Tinetti said.
Health professionals increasingly recognize that if they’re not in pediatrics, they will be seeing lots of seniors, whatever their specialty. A 2016 American Medical Association survey, for example, found that close to 40% of patients treated by internists and general surgeons were Medicare beneficiaries.
“Our medical students are living and breathing this,” said Supiano, who also teaches at the University of Utah School of Medicine. He warns them, “If you don’t like taking care of older people, find another career.”

Paul Krugman: Trump the intimidator fails again

Texto completo: International crises often lead, at least initially, to surging support for a country’s leadership. And that’s clearly happening now. Just weeks ago, the nation’s leader faced public discontent so intense that his grip on power seemed at risk. Now the assassination of Gen. Qassem Soleimani has transformed the situation, generating a wave of patriotism that has greatly bolstered the people in charge.
Unfortunately, this patriotic rallying around the flag is happening not in America, where many are (with good reason) deeply suspicious of Donald Trump’s motives, but in Iran.
In other words, Trump’s latest attempt to bully another country has backfired — just like all his previous attempts.
From his first days in office, Trump has acted on the apparent belief that he could easily intimidate foreign governments — that they would quickly fold and allow themselves to be humiliated. That is, he imagined that he faced a world of Lindsey Grahams, willing to abandon all dignity at the first hint of a challenge.
But this strategy keeps failing; the regimes he threatens are strengthened rather than weakened, and Trump is the one who ends up making humiliating concessions.
Remember, for example, when Trump promised “fire and fury” unless North Korea halted its nuclear weapons program? He claimed triumph after a 2018 summit meeting with Kim Jong Un, North Korea’s leader. But Kim made no real concessions, and North Korea recently announced that it might resume tests of nuclear weapons and long-range missiles.
Or consider the trade war with China, which was supposed to bring the Chinese to their knees. A deal has supposedly been reached, although details remain scarce; what’s clear is that it falls far short of U.S. aims, and that Chinese officials are jubilant about their success in facing Trump down.
Why does Trump’s international strategy, which might be described as winning through intimidation, keep failing? And why does he keep pursuing it anyway?
One answer, I suspect, is that like all too many Americans, Trump has a hard time grasping the fact that other countries are real — that is, that we’re not the only country whose citizens would rather pay a heavy price, in money and even in blood, than make what they see as humiliating concessions.
Ask yourself, how would Americans have reacted if a foreign power had assassinated Dick Cheney, claiming that he had the blood of hundreds of thousands of Iraqis on his hands? Don’t answer that Soleimani was worse. That’s beside the point. The point is that we don’t accept the right of foreign governments to kill our officials. Why imagine that other countries are different?
Of course, we have many people in the diplomatic corps with a deep knowledge of other nations and their motivations, who understand the limits of intimidation. But anyone with that kind of understanding has been excluded from Trump’s inner circle.
Now, it’s true that for many years America did have a special leadership position, one that sometimes involved playing a role in reshaping other countries’ political systems. But here’s where Trump’s second error comes in: He has never shown any sign of understanding why America used to be special.
Part of the explanation, of course, was raw economic and military power: America used to be just much bigger than everyone else. That is, however, no longer true. For example, by some key measures China’s economy is significantly bigger than that of the United States.
Even more important, however, was the fact that America was something more than a big country throwing its weight around. We always stood for something larger.
That doesn’t mean that we were always a force for good; America did many terrible things during its reign as global hegemon. But we clearly stood for global rule of law, for a system that imposed common rules on everyone, ourselves included. The United States may have been the dominant partner in alliances like NATO and bodies like the World Trade Organization, but we always tried to behave as no more than first among equals.
Oh, and because we were committed to enforcing rules, we were also relatively trustworthy; an alliance with America was meaningful, because we weren’t the kind of country that would betray an ally for the sake of short-term political convenience.
Trump, however, has turned his back on everything that used to make America great. Under his leadership, we’ve become nothing more than a big, self-interested bully — a bully with delusions of grandeur, who isn’t nearly as tough as he thinks. We abruptly abandon allies like the Kurds; we honor war criminals; we slap punitive tariffs on friendly nations like Canada for no good reason. And, of course, after more than 15,000 lies, nothing our leader and his minions say can be trusted.
Trump officials seem taken aback by the uniformly negative consequences of the Soleimani killing: The Iranian regime is empowered, Iraq has turned hostile and nobody has stepped up in our support. But that’s what happens when you betray all your friends and squander all your credibility.

Richard A. Friedman: Why are young Americans killing themselves?

Texto completo: Editor’s note • This article discusses suicide. If you or people you know are at risk of self-harm, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline provides 24-hour support at 1-800-273-8255.
Teenagers and young adults in the United States are being ravaged by a mental health crisis — and we are doing nothing about it.
As of 2017, statistics show that an alarming number of them are suffering from depression and dying by suicide. In fact, suicide is now the second leading cause of death among young people, surpassed only by accidents.
After declining for nearly two decades, the suicide rate among Americans ages 10 to 24 jumped 56 percent between 2007 and 2017, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And for the first time the gender gap in suicide has narrowed: Though the numbers of suicides are greater in males, the rates of suicide for female youths increased by 12.7 percent each year, compared with 7.1 percent for male youths.
At the same time, the rate of teen depression shot up 63 percent, an alarming but not surprising trend given the link between suicide and depression: In 2017, 13 percent of teens reported at least one episode of depression in the past year, compared with 8 percent of teens in 2007, according to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health.
How is it possible that so many of our young people are suffering from depression and killing themselves when we know perfectly well how to treat this illness? If thousands of teens were dying from a new infectious disease or a heart ailment, there would be a public outcry and a national call to action.
While young people are generally physically healthy, they are psychiatrically vulnerable. Three-quarters of all the mental illness that we see in adults has already occurred by age 25. Our collective failure to act in the face of this epidemic is all the more puzzling since we are living at a time when people are generally more accepting of mental illness and stigma is on the wane.
You’d think it would be no big deal to see your family doctor or a therapist and get your depression treated like any other medical problem. But the data suggest otherwise: Only 45 percent of teenage girls who had an episode of depression in 2019 received any treatment, and just 33 percent of teenage boys with depression did. In contrast, two-thirds of adults with a recent episode of depression received treatment.
What explains the epidemic of teen depression and suicide? There are lots of theories but few definitive answers.
Some researchers emphasize the potential role of social media exposure and use of smartphones. There is some evidence that girls, who have shown greater rates of increase in depression than boys, experience more cyberbullying because of their greater use of mobile phones and texting. But most studies of digital technology and mental health are correlational and can’t prove causation.
Drugs and alcohol are always a popular culprit, but in this case they are an unlikely explanation, as the studies cited above controlled for drug use. In addition, there is no evidence of a significant increase in the use of drugs or alcohol in young people during the study period.
It is legitimate (though controversial) to ask whether the Food and Drug Administration’s “black box” warning for antidepressants back in 2004 — which said the drugs could cause suicidal thoughts and actions in some children and teenagers — discouraged the use of these drugs and unwittingly helped fuel the rise in teen depression. Within two years of the FDA advisory, antidepressant use dropped by 31 percent in teens and 24 percent in young adults. Although antidepressant use recovered somewhat after 2008, it has remained below levels that would have been expected based on prescribing patterns before the warnings appeared.
The good news is that we don’t have to wait for all the answers to know what to do. We know that various psychotherapies and medication are highly effective in treating depression. We just need to do a better job of identifying, reaching out to and providing resources for at-risk youths.
To start, we need a major public campaign to educate parents and teachers to recognize depression in young people and to learn about the warning signs of suicide — like a sudden change in behavior, talking or writing about suicide, and giving away prized possessions. We should have universal screening of teenagers at school, with parental consent, to identify those who are suffering from depression and who are at risk of suicide. And we have to provide adequate funding and resources to match the mental health needs of our young people.
Every day, 16 young people die from suicide. What are we waiting for?

Campaigns for both are running commercials during the game, according to NBC News.
Trump's campaign will spend $10 million on 60 seconds of ad time, which could be one 60-second ad or two 30-second ads.
"We moved early and got prime ad position early in the game," a Trump official said.
The New York Times reports that Bloomberg locked down a 60-second advertisement for the game that will likely cost $10 million.
"The biggest point is getting under Trump's skin," said Michael Frazier, a spokesman for the Bloomberg campaign.

Texto completo: Soup, the most basic of dishes, is an important part of every cultural cuisine. Originally “soupe” or “sops” described a hot broth poured on or combined with bread, the bread being the sopping vehicle.
When I was growing up on a ranch in Colorado, the big meal of the day was lunch. Supper, which was the last meal of the day before bed, was often something “soupy” or “stewy,” a simple one-dish meal that was easily digested and helped you sleep. The dividing line between soups and stews is vague! My friend Amy Mintzer recalls that when she went to summer camp as a little girl, they also served the big meal at lunch with some kind of soup for dinner. They called the dinner soup “cream of lunch”!
Here are some of my favorite soups for winter.
------
This takes advantage of ready-made ingredients like canned beans, making it very quick to put together.
White Bean and Tortellini Soup with Kale
Serves 4 to 6
1 tablespoon olive oil
3 ounces pancetta or bacon (3 slices), cut into ¼-inch dice
1 small white onion, sliced thinly lengthwise (about 2 cups)
2 teaspoons peeled and thinly sliced garlic
1 cup peeled carrots, cut into ¼-inch dice
½ teaspoon fennel seed
6 cups chicken or vegetable stock
1½ cups (4 ounces or so) store-bought, fresh cheese tortellini
1 15-ounce can (2 cups home-cooked) cannellini beans, drained and rinsed
6 small kale leaves, center rib removed and cut into ¼-inch strips
1 cup cherry or grape tomatoes, halved
— Salt and freshly ground pepper
1/3 cup Parmigiano-Reggiano, shaved with a vegetable peeler (1 ounce)
Heat the oil and pancetta in a deep saucepan or soup pot over moderate heat and cook, stirring frequently, until pancetta is browned and crisp, about 5 minutes. With a slotted spoon, transfer pancetta to a paper towel-lined plate.
Add the onion, garlic, carrots and fennel seed to the pan and cook, stirring, until the vegetables have softened, about 5 minutes. Add the stock and, with heat on high, bring to a boil. Add tortellini and cook until just tender, about 3 minutes. Add the beans, kale and tomatoes and heat through. Season to your taste with salt and pepper. Serve the soup topped with the Parmigiano and reserved pancetta.

Borscht is claimed by several ethnic groups, especially Ukrainians, Russians, Poles, Lithuanians and Ashkenazi Jews, as their own. Borscht also plays a role in religious traditions of various denominations (Eastern Orthodox, Greek and Roman Catholic and Jewish) that are common in Eastern Europe. In East Slavic countries, “memorial borscht” is served as the first course at a wake. According to traditional beliefs, the soul of the departed either feeds on or is carried up to heaven by puffs of steam rising from bowls of borscht and other hot dishes, such as blini or porridge that are served after the funeral.
In Poland and Ukraine, borscht is usually served at Christmas Eve dinner. In the Eastern European Ashkenazi Jewish tradition, vegetarian borscht served with sour cream and boiled potatoes on the side, known as peysakhdiker borsht, is considered essential during Passover.
There are endless variations of the recipe — meat and meatless, cold or hot. Original versions didn’t include beets but were made from fermented hog weed, giving the soup a sour flavor. Modern recipes still include a sour ingredient — vinegar, lemon or even sauerkraut — to complement the sweetness of the beets. Roasting the beets deepens their flavor and sweetness
Roasted Beet Borscht
Makes 2 quarts serving 6 to 8
2 pounds red beets
4 tablespoons olive oil
— Salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 medium sweet red onion, peeled and chopped, about 3 cups
1 cup peeled and chopped carrot
3 cups chopped red cabbage
1 cup chopped celery
2 teaspoons peeled and chopped garlic
1 teaspoon fennel or caraway seed
7 cups beef or chicken stock
2 tablespoons red wine vinegar or to taste
2 tablespoons tomato paste
Garnish:
— Sour cream or crème fraiche
1 hardboiled egg, peeled and chopped
— Fresh dill or parsley sprigs
Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Scrub the beets well and remove leaves and the tap root at the bottom. Place the beets in a baking pan or dish, brush them liberally with 2 tablespoons olive oil and season well with salt and pepper. Roast until tender (a skewer should easily pierce them), about 1 hour 15 minutes. Cool and rub off skins. Chop into ½-inch pieces and reserve.
Heat remaining 2 tablespoons of oil in a soup pot over medium heat. Add onions, carrots, cabbage, celery, garlic and fennel seed. Cook until vegetables are softened and just beginning to color, about 10 minutes. Add stock, reserved beets, vinegar and tomato paste and simmer until vegetables are tender, about 15 minutes.
Leave the soup chunky or puree it according to your desire (I prefer the former). Adjust flavor to you taste with salt, pepper and vinegar. Serve warm or chilled, garnished with a dollop of sour cream, chopped hard boiled eggs and fresh dill or parsley.

Craig Claiborne, food editor of the New York Times in the 1960s through the 1980s, called this soup “the most elegant and delicious soup ever created . . . one of the sublime creations on Earth.”
Billi Bi was allegedly named after William B. Leeds, Sr., in the early 1900s. Leeds was a wealthy American tin tycoon who went regularly to Paris, where he was known to dine nightly at Maxim’s, then probably the world’s most noted restaurant. The recipe was created by chef Louis Barthe, and the soup became such a favorite of Leeds that it was kept permanently on the menu in his honor. Sadly Billy, as his friends called him, died in 1908 of a stroke at the Hotel Ritz in Paris.
There are several admonitions about mussels: Don’t pull the beards from the mussels until you are ready to cook them, as this kills the mussels. Also, a mussel’s shell should close if it is tapped on a counter. Any mussels that do not close are dead or filled with mud and should be discarded. All the mussels we buy in the market today are farm-raised and very closely monitored. Given what’s going on in our oceans today, I’d only buy farm raised. Resist the temptation to gather your own. Here’s the original New York Times recipe, with a little editing.
Billi Bi
Makes 2 to 4 servings as a main course, 6 to 8 as an appetizer
2 pounds mussels
1/3 cup peeled and coarsely chopped shallots
2 sprigs parsley, plus chopped parsley for garnish
— Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
1 cup dry white wine, like pinot grigio or sauvignon blanc
2 tablespoons unsalted butter, cubed
1 bay leaf
2 sprigs fresh thyme (½ teaspoon dry)
2 cups heavy cream or crème fraiche
1 egg yolk, lightly beaten
Scrub mussels well to remove dirt and, if necessary, remove beards. Place mussels in large saucepan or Dutch oven and add shallots, parsley, salt, pepper, wine, butter, bay leaf and thyme. Cover and bring to a boil over medium heat. Reduce heat and simmer 4 to 5 minutes, or until mussels have opened. Discard any that have not opened.
Strain liquid through a fine-meshed strainer and reserve. When cool enough to handle, remove mussels from shells (you might save a few for garnish) and reserve. Discard shells and aromatics.
In a small saucepan, bring reserved liquid to a low boil. Add cream and return mixture almost to a boil, then remove from heat. Let cool slightly then whisk in egg yolk to combine. Return saucepan to heat, continue whisking and let thicken slightly but do not boil.
Adjust seasoning to taste. To serve, arrange mussels in center of large soup dishes and ladle broth over them. Sprinkle with chopped parsley. Enjoy!
------
In addition to soup, I use this as a base sauce for all kinds of recipes, my favorite being quickly-seared dayboat scallops. Make a big batch and keep in the freezer.
Creamy Cauliflower Soup
Makes about 2 quarts
2 tablespoons unsalted butter
1 medium yellow onion, peeled and diced
4 medium cloves garlic, thinly sliced
½ teaspoon fennel seed
1 2-pound head cauliflower, trimmed, cored and cut into florets
3 cups or so vegetable or chicken stock
3 tablespoons dry sherry
— A few gratings of nutmeg
2 cups crème fraiche
— Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper to taste
— Drops of lemon juice and cayenne to taste
— Drops of peppery extra virgin olive oil
In a large saucepan, melt butter over medium-high heat. Add onion, garlic and fennel seed and cook, stirring often, until softened and translucent, about 5 minutes; lower heat as necessary to prevent browning.
Add cauliflower and stock (vegetables should be covered). Bring to a simmer, cover and cook, adjusting heat to maintain simmer. Cook until cauliflower is tender, about 20 minutes. Stir in sherry and nutmeg.
Using a blender, puree cauliflower mixture and crème fraiche to a very smooth consistency. Season to your taste with salt, pepper, drops of lemon juice and a little cayenne, if desired. You can adjust purée consistency by adding less stock, especially if you are going to use as a sauce. Garnish with olive oil. Serve warm.

This is a hearty, unusual soup that could be the centerpiece of a meal. The flavor of the poblano chile is even better if you char-roast it before adding it in. Canned hominy is fine but if you can cook your own from the dry corn, the flavor is much better.
A good source for dry hominy that cooks more quickly than traditional hominy is Rancho Gordo, which is available at local grocery stores like Oliver’s and ranchogordo.com.
Poblano, Tomatillo and Shrimp Chowder with Hominy
Serves 8
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 medium white onions, halved and sliced thinly lengthwise
2 large stemmed and seeded fresh poblano chiles, cut into large dice
1 tablespoon finely slivered garlic
½ teaspoon each whole fennel, cumin and coriander seeds
2 teaspoons dried oregano (preferably Mexican)
2 cups husked and quartered fresh tomatillos
2 cups diced and seeded tomatoes (drained if using canned)
7 cups rich chicken, corn or vegetable stock
— Kosher or sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
¼ cup fresh lime juice
12 ounces medium (21–24) peeled and deveined raw shrimp
¾ cup cooked and drained white hominy
¼ cup coarsely chopped cilantro
¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon
— Lime wedges
— Garnish: Thinly sliced and fanned avocado and cilantro sprigs, if desired
In a heavy-bottomed soup pot, heat the olive oil over moderately high heat. Add the onions, poblanos, garlic, fennel seeds, cumin seeds and coriander seeds. Sauté until onions are soft but not brown, about 5 minutes. Add the tomatillos, oregano, tomatoes and stock. Simmer gently for 6 to 8 minutes. Season to your taste with salt, pepper and drops of lime juice.
To serve: Stir in the shrimp, hominy, cilantro and cinnamon and simmer for 2 minutes to just cook the shrimp through (they should be slightly translucent in the middle). Ladle into warm soup bowls and garnish with the avocado slices, cilantro sprigs and lime wedges.
------
This takes a little time but it’s worth it. It freezes well, so make a double batch and freeze half to have on hand whenever you need a quick, hearty meal.
It starts with making a stock from smoked pork shanks. If you don’t want to make the stock, you could use chicken stock and add a ham bone while the soup cooks, then remove it before serving.
Black Bean Soup
Serves 6 to 8
For the stock:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 medium white onion, chopped (about 2-½ cups)
1 cup chopped celery
1 cup peeled and chopped carrots
1 tablespoon peeled and chopped garlic
2 large bay leaves
1 teaspoon black peppercorns, crushed
3 quarts water
1½ pounds or so smoked pork shanks, cut into 2-inch sections (ask your butcher to do)
For the soup:
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 medium white onions, chopped
4 large cloves garlic, chopped
3 medium poblano peppers, stemmed, seeded and cut into large dice
2 teaspoons ground cumin
1 teaspoon fennel seed
1 tablespoon dried oregano, preferably Mexican
1 quart smoked shank, chicken or vegetable stock or a combination
6 cups cooked black beans (from 1 pound dried)
8 ounces shucked and rinsed tomatillos cut in quarters
8-10 ounces picked smoked shank meat, chopped
2 cups (1 15-ounce can) petite diced canned tomatoes, preferably fire roasted
— Salt and freshly ground pepper
Garnishes (any or all!):
— Chopped green onions, including tops
— Cilantro sprigs
— Diced avocado
— Sliced radishes
— Thinly sliced fried corn tortillas
— Steamed rice
— Lime wedges
— Crema or sour cream
— Chopped jalapeño or serrano chiles
For the stock: Heat the olive oil in a soup pot over medium heat. Add the onions, celery, carrots, garlic, bay leaves and peppercorns and sauté until vegetables are softened and just beginning to brown. Add the water and smoked shanks (no salt at this point since shanks are salty). Bring to a boil then reduce heat and simmer partially covered until meat is very tender, about 2 hours. Remove shanks and set aside. When cool enough to handle, pick the meat and reserve. Discard bones and skin.
Strain cooking stock through a medium mesh strainer, discarding the solids. You should have about 4 cups of stock. Skim as much of the fat from the surface as you can.
For the soup: Heat the oil in a soup pot over moderately high heat and sauté the onions, garlic, poblanos, cumin, fennel seed and oregano until the onions are softened, about 6 minutes. Add stock, beans, tomatillos, picked meat and tomatoes and simmer for a few minutes more. Season to your taste with salt and pepper. Serve with garnishes to be added as desired.

Prime has a new CEO Prime Automotive Group has named a new chief executive, Todd Skelton, to run the Westwood-based chain of dealerships. Skelton most recently was president of the Northeast market for AutoNation. Skelton left AutoNation last year, and recently moved from the Baltimore area to Massachusetts. Interim chief executive Kevin Westfall has returned to the chairman's role at Prime, which is controlled by GPB Capital of New York. (Westfall is also a former AutoNation executive.) Former CEO David Rosenberg was pushed aside last year after he sued GPB in Norfolk Superior Court, accusing the investment firm of financial misconduct. Rosenberg claims he was wrongfully terminated, while GPB denies his allegations. — JON CHESTO
MEDIA
WGBH to open a bureau in Worcester WGBH is heading to Worcester. The Boston-based public broadcaster unveiled plans to open a one-person satellite bureau in the city, at 27 Federal St., coincidentally the former home of the Worcester Telegram & Gazette. The 1,000-square-foot bureau will house a fully equipped broadcast studio when it opens this spring. The bureau will focus on producing news stories for 89.7 FM (WGBH's radio station) and for WGBH's website. The Worcester bureau is being funded in part by two family foundations. — JON CHESTO
ELECTRIC VEHICLES
Tesla's Shanghai factory delivers its first cars to customers Tesla's Shanghai factory delivered its first cars to customers Monday and chief executive Elon Musk said the electric automaker plans to set up a design center in China to create a model for worldwide sales. Musk presided at a ceremony where a half-dozen buyers wearing red Tesla T shirts drove away new Model 3 sedans. He expressed thanks to earlier customers who he said made Tesla's expansion in China possible by purchasing imported models from the fledgling brand. Tesla Inc. built the Gigafactory 3, its first outside the United States, following the Communist Party's 2018 decision to allow full foreign ownership in electric car manufacturing. It is due to produce the Model 3 and a planned SUV, the Model Y. — ASSOCIATED PRESS
RIDE HAILING
Uber offering pin codes for passenger safety Uber is offering riders a four-digit pin code to help ensure they're getting into the right car. The ride-hailing company rolled out the new feature across the United States and Canada Tuesday and said all riders in those two countries will be able to use pin codes by the end of the week. The development follows the death of 21-year-old Samantha “Sami" Josephson, who was murdered in March after getting into the car of a man impersonating an Uber driver. Her body was later found in the woods 65 miles away. Since then, states have been pushing for additional safety requirements for Uber drivers. In New Jersey, where Josephson grew up, the state passed a law requiring ride-hailing drivers to display identification signs on the car's front windshield and rear window. North Carolina passed a law requiring Uber and Lyft drivers to display lighted signs. — ASSOCIATED PRESS
TECHNOLOGY
Sonos sues Google over speaker technology Sonos alleged in two federal lawsuits Tuesday that Google swiped its speaker technology to create its own, seeking a halt on further sales of speakers and other devices that contain the hardware as well as financial penalties. In the suits, filed with the US District Court in Los Angeles and the US International Trade Commission, Sonos claims Google co-opted patented technology that allows for its speakers to work in multiple rooms and put it to use in its own speakers including the Google Home and Pixel devices and the discontinued Chromecast Audio. Google gained access to Sonos' technology through a partnership begun in 2013 allowing Sonos' speakers to work with Google Play Music, according to the suits. "Google has not merely copied Sonos's patented technology, it has also subsidized the prices of its patent infringing products, including at the entry level, and flooded the market," according to one of the suits. "These actions have caused significant damage to Sonos." Google denied the allegations and said it would "vigorously" defend itself in court. "Over the years, we have had numerous ongoing conversations with Sonos about both companies' IP rights and we are disappointed that Sonos brought these lawsuits instead of continuing negotiations in good faith," said a spokesman, Jose Castaneda. The lawsuits were reported earlier by The New York Times. — WASHINGTON POST
INTERNATIONAL
Finnish leader denies study of four-day work week As Finland's prime minister, Sanna Marin, scanned international news headlines this week, she may have been surprised to learn that she was being credited for looking into the feasibility of a four-day work week. On Tuesday, Marin's government put an end to the myth. The idea of drastically shorter working hours was briefly touched on by Marin in August, months before she was made Finnish prime minister in December. But the government now wants to make clear that a four-day week isn't on the agenda and "there hasn't been any recent activity" on the topic, according to a Twitter update on Tuesday. — BLOOMBERG NEWS

India's economy likely to face slowest growth since 2013 India's economy is on track for its slowest growth since at least 2013, weighed down by a shadow banking crisis, weak investment, and a slump in spending. Gross domestic product will grow 5 percent in the year through March 2020, the Statistics Ministry said in a statement in New Delhi on Tuesday. That is in line with the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of 22 economists and compares with 6.8 percent expansion in the previous year. That pace will place India, which was the world's fastest-growing major economy last year, behind regional peers like China, Vietnam, and the Philippines, all of which are seen expanding close to 6 percent or more. — BLOOMBERG NEWS
FOOD
Move over Impossible Burger, Impossible Sausage is coming After a big year for its plant-based burger, Impossible Foods has something new on its plate. The California-based company unveiled Impossible Pork and Impossible Sausage on Monday evening at the CES gadget show in Las Vegas. It's Impossible Food's first foray beyond fake beef. The Impossible Burger, which went on sale in 2016, has been a key player in the growing category of vegan meats. Like the burger, Impossible Food's pork and sausage are made from soy but mimic the taste and texture of ground meat. Burger King will give consumers their first taste of Impossible Sausage. Later this month, 139 Burger King restaurants in five US cities will offer the Impossible Croissan'wich, made with plant-based sausage coupled with the traditional egg and cheese. Burger King did a similar test of the Impossible Whopper last year before expanding sales nationwide. — ASSOCIATED PRESS

GM sees more woes ahead for its business in China General Motors Co. warned pressure on its China business will persist this year as the world's biggest auto market suffers a prolonged slump, exacerbated by a lackluster economy and the trade war with the United States. GM and its partners sold 3.09 million vehicles in China in 2019, according to a statement Tuesday. That represents a 15 percent decline for a company that was once the top foreign automaker in China. — BLOOMBERG NEWS

Texto completo: Hans Anthony "Toni" Huber
Toni Huber let go of this particular world on December 27 after fully inhabiting it for 86 years, 2 months, and 6 days. He had stuff to do that he couldn't do here, so he had to go. First on his list was building a wooden boat.
This was no ordinary man. Toni had an easy, original, and irresistible charm. His rumbly, baritone voice could carry across a football field. He was extremely funny and didn't know how to tell a dull story. He swore constantly and effortlessly, outdoing any drunken sailor on the planet. It was hard not to love him.
Toni was born in Manhattan and attended preschool in the city at The Little Red School House. He did receive further education (Rumson Country Day School, Millbrook, Amherst College) but he would be the first to tell you that his academic performance pretty much went downhill after The Little Red School House.
But that didn't mean he wasn't brilliant.
"Toni Hans Anthony Huber is my name and bold adventure is my game," he would announce on almost a daily basis. He was a pilot, a boatsman, and a woodworker. He was an ace skierâ€"because of his skiing prowess he was recruited to serve in the U.S. Army's famed 10th Mountain Division. He was an excellent marksman and once, in Maine, he shot a bat out of the rafters at first try from 50 feet. With a BB gun. He knew flora and fauna and world geography and physics and could do the end-of-the week New York Times crossword puzzles. He could do a perfect moose call, and a moose would actually come out of the forest. He read voraciously on any subject, but was partial to WWII books, thrillers, and the dictionary. He seemed to know about everything and if he didn't, he'd convince you that he did.
"Parfait du shay." "Habo gazabeo." "Check blamp." Don't know what these phrases mean? Neither does anyone else. Not even Toni's family. These are just a few of hundreds of "Toni-isms" that he would sprinkle into his conversation, thereby driving his wife insane. Somehow, he managed to be both a terrible curmudgeon and a very jolly man. As far as he was concerned, the glass was always three-quarters full. He never complained. His powerful personality ruled the world around him. It was (almost always) a joy to be in his orbit.
Toni is survived by his four daughters, Lisa Huber (Bill Buchsbaum), Shelley Huber, Catherine Niederer (Bob), and Andrea Huber; his grandchildren Anna and Ellie Goodspeed, Merrill Henderson (Wade), Bobby and Tad Gaffey, and Josie Schneider; his stepchildren Susan Boynton and Burr Boynton (Sally), and Jake Reichert (Kelley); his step-grandchildren Eric Clifford (Kathy), Samantha Somero (Troy), and Kayla, JD, and Brooke Reichert; one great-grandchild, Lorelei Henderson; and one step-great-grandchild, Peter Somero. Toni is also survived by his wife, Laurel, who will miss him every second of every day for the rest of her life.

Clinton Backer at Facebook Debunks Clinton Claims; Plus, Chelsea shows Hunter that you don't have to fly to Ukraine to get rich.

Texto completo: Former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and politicians like Rep. Adam Schiff (D., Calif.) may cling to the discredited belief that Donald Trump and Russia used social media to rig the 2016 election. But liberals in a position to know still aren't buying it.
The New York Times reports that it has obtained a recent internal memorandum from senior Facebook executive Andrew Bosworth. According to the text of the memo published by the Times, Mr. Bosworth throws cold water on a favorite conspiracy theory of the political left:
So was Facebook responsible for Donald Trump getting elected? I think the answer is yes, but not for the reasons anyone thinks. He didn't get elected because of Russia or misinformation or Cambridge Analytica. He got elected because he ran the single best digital ad campaign I've ever seen from any advertiser. Period.
Cambridge Analytica was a political consulting firm and Trump campaign vendor which was accused of using personal data about Facebook users without their knowledge. The Federal Trade Commission recently settled a case with some of those involved, who agreed to destroy the data they collected and be honest with users in the future about data collection. The memo from Facebook's Mr. Bosworth continues:
To be clear, I'm no fan of Trump. I donated the max to Hillary. After his election I wrote a post about Trump supporters that I'm told caused colleagues who had supported him to feel unsafe around me (I regret that post and deleted shortly after).
But [Trump campaign digital media chief Brad Parscale] and Trump just did unbelievable work. They weren't running misinformation or hoaxes. They weren't microtargeting or saying different things to different people. They just used the tools we had to show the right creative to each person. The use of custom audiences, video, ecommerce, and fresh creative remains the high water mark of digital ad campaigns in my opinion.
"Creative" is a noun in the marketing world, used to describe the particular advertisements designed to deliver messages. Mr. Bosworth fears that Team Trump is still really good at creating them and therefore he fears that Mr. Trump may win again. "As a committed liberal I find myself desperately wanting to pull any lever at my disposal to avoid the same result. So what stays my hand?," asks Mr. Bosworth. He writes, "I find myself thinking of the Lord of the Rings at this moment. Specifically when Frodo offers the ring to Galadrial and she imagines using the power righteously, at first, but knows it will eventually corrupt her. As tempting as it is to use the tools available to us to change the outcome, I am confident we must never do that or we will become that which we fear."
This column is skeptical that Facebook decides the outcomes of U.S. elections, but applauds Mr. Bosworth's effort to encourage his Silicon Valley colleagues to act with integrity. Also encouraging is that he's just the latest Valley resident to attempt to provide a reality check to anti-Trump partisans.
Readers may recall Google CEO Sundar Pichai's December, 2018 visit to the House Judiciary committee. That's when Chairman Jerry Nadler (D., N.Y.) asked if Google knew "the full extent to which its online platforms were exploited by Russian actors in the election two years ago".
Mr. Pichai reported that after a thorough investigation his company had discovered "two main ad accounts linked to Russia" which had spent on Google advertising a grand total of... $4,700. This amounted to roughly 1/234,000th of what Mrs. Clinton spent on advertising during the 2016 campaign.
Meanwhile over at Facebook, the number seems to have been larger but still tiny in comparison to overall political advertising. Writes Mr. Bosworth:
$100,000 in ads on Facebook can be a powerful tool but it can't buy you an American election, especially when the candidates themselves are putting up several orders of magnitude more money on the same platform (not to mention other platforms).
Instead, the Russians worked to exploit existing divisions in the American public for example by hosting Black Lives Matter and Blue Lives Matter protest events in the same city on the same day. The people who shows (sic) up to those events were real even if the event coordinator was not. Likewise the groups of Americans being fed partisan content was real even if those feeding them were not. The organic reach they managed sounds very big in absolute terms and unfortunately humans are bad at contextualizing big numbers. Whatever reach they managed represents an infinitesimal fraction of the overall content people saw in the same period of time and certainly over the course of an election across all media.

Hillary Clinton may remain confused about what happened in 2016 but her family continues to thrive financially. Ed Lin reports in Barron's that daughter Chelsea Clinton's stock in Internet company IAC is now worth $9 million.
IAC's chairman is Barry Diller, a longtime donor to the campaigns of Democratic politicians, including the Clintons. Chelsea Clinton serves on the board of IAC and according to Mr. Lin, her board tenure has been lucrative:
Clinton, who has been an IAC director since 2011, receives an annual $50,000 retainer and $250,000 in restricted IAC stock units, or RSUs. As of Dec. 31, she owned the equivalent of 35,242 IAC shares, consisting of 29,843 shares and 5,399 share units under a deferred-compensation plan, according to a form she filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Share units convert to stock when an IAC director leaves the board.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Democratic presidential candidate Michael Bloomberg is spending millions on an advertisement during the 2020 Super Bowl, which is one of the most watched broadcast television events of the year.
The former New York City Mayor will have a 60-second ad run during the annual sporting event, the Bloomberg campaign confirmed to USA TODAY. The Super Bowl will take place on Feb. 2 at the Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Fla.
More: As Soleimani killing jolts presidential race, Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders seize the moment
According to the New York Times, the ad will target President Donald Trump, who will also be advertising during the game.
“The biggest point is getting under Trump’s skin,” Bloomberg spokesman Michael Frazier told the New York Times. “We have the means to raise a national campaign unlike any other candidate. ”
Although the Bloomberg campaign would not disclose how much the ad cost, Seth Winter, Fox’s executive vice president of sports sales, told Variety in November that 30-second ads cost "north of $5 million. " A 60-second ad would likely cost double that amount.
Several hours after news broke that Bloomberg’s campaign was spending that amount on advertising, news broke that Trump’s campaign is also expected to drop at least $10 million in advertising at the Super Bowl.
According to Politico, Trump’s campaign has purchased 60 seconds of commercial time, but it’s unclear whether it will be a single 60-second commercial or a pair of 30-second ads. The ad time is expected to to run early in the game.
“Super Bowl ad is an indicator that the @realDonaldTrump campaign is ramping up as 2020 begins,” Tim Murtaugh, Trump campaign communications director wrote in a tweet, sharing the Politico article. “Also big plans to spend on outreach to women, blacks, Latinos & religious voters. The President’s record and unprecedented fundraising make this possible. ”
Since announcing his candidacy in November, Bloomberg has spent more than $100 million on advertising. The ad will come a day before the Iowa caucuses, which is the start of 2020 primary elections. Bloomberg, however, is not competing in the early states and instead is focusing on later elections such as Super Tuesday.

Resumen: Elizabeth Wurtzel, author of the best-selling memoir "Prozac Nation," has died at age 52, according to media reports.

Texto completo: Elizabeth Wurtzel, the writer best known for her best-selling 1994 memoir “Prozac Nation: Young and Depressed in America,” has died at a hospital in Manhattan after a long battle with cancer, her husband, Jim Freed, told The Associated Press. She was 52.
Named for the popular anti-depressant, “Prozac Nation” chronicled Wurtzel’s struggle with depression and drug addiction with candor and humor, and is credited with helping to destigmatize conversations about mental health.
Wurtzel was diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer, resulting from the BRCA genetic mutation. Wurtzel became an advocate for BRCA testing after her diagnosis, writing in a 2015 article for The Times, “I DID not know I have the BRCA mutation. I did not know I would likely get breast cancer when I was still young, when the disease is a wild animal. I caught it fast and I acted fast, but I must have looked away: By the time of my double mastectomy, the cancer had spread to five lymph nodes. ”
Wurtzel went on to write, “According to the PET scan, I am cancer free. I am cured. But cancer plays hide and seek in wunderkind ways. It is the sparkle of dirt at the bottom of the dustbin that never gets tossed. ”
Many celebrities, writers and journalists are paying their tributes online to Wurtzel, who blazed a path for a raw, confessional style of autobiography.
Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Ronan Farrow posted a photo of the Wurtzel and himself on Instagram, writing, "Lizzie started at Yale Law mid-career as I was starting young. We were both misfits and she was kind and generous and filled spaces in my life that might have otherwise been lonely with her warmth and humor and idiosyncratic voice. She gave a lot to a lot of us. I miss her. "
Farrow's mother, actress Mia Farrow, paid her condolences on Twitter, calling Wurtzel "a friend to our family. "
Matt Haig, author of "Reasons to Stay Alive," a memoir about his experiences with depression and anxiety, wrote on Twitter, "If it wasn’t for Prozac Nation, I - and many others - would have never written about mental health. This is sad news. "
Wurtzel is the author of several additional books, including “More, Now, Again: A Memoir of Addiction” and "Bitch: In Praise of Difficult Women. "

Trump was right on Iran. Democrats are suffering from mass amnesia.

Texto completo: I have spent the past 20 or so New Years’ Eves glued to the SyFy channel’s “Twilight Zone” marathon. My wife and I love the writing, the plots and picking out famous actors in their one-off roles for the classic television series.
Maybe I’ll write an episode of my own, complete with a Rod Serling-worthy opening monologue: “The year is 2017. Donald Trump is inaugurated as president of the United States, and mass amnesia has washed over America. Half the country can no longer remember anything that happened before Jan. 20. The former president, Barack Obama, is literally sitting right there. Yet, his own party cannot remember one thing about his eight years …”
Obama memory hole
It is one of the strangest phenomena of the Trump era — the memory-holing of Obama’s executive powers. Democrats continuously act as though they’ve just fallen off the Washington turnip wagon when Trump does anything.
Trump’s illegal immigration policies are draconian! He’s deporting too many, they screamed, forgetting that … Obama deported more. A lot more. And, you know those cages on the southern border? Obama built them, not Trump.
Trump’s defying congressional subpoenas! No president has ever stonewalled Congress, they screamed, forgetting that Obama’s attorney general, Eric Holder, was held in contempt of Congress for … defying subpoenas related to the "Fast and Furious" gun operation scandal. There were at least eight other times when Obama’s administration defied congressional oversight, even preventing people from testifying (sound familiar?).
More from Scott Jennings: Which 2020 Democrat can beat Donald Trump? Don't bet on Biden, Warren or Sanders.
When Trump announced his “America First” policy during his inaugural, Democrats apparently took it as literally as one can.
Now, they howl over Trump’s latest outrage: The airstrike that killed Iranian terrorist Qasem Soleimani, the general who was in Iraq fomenting attacks against the U. S. Embassy and, evidently, plotting future hits on American targets.
Washington Democrats whined about Trump authorizing a drone strike without their notification or consent. This, after Obama authorized at least 2,800 drone strikes in Iraq and Syria without congressional approval.
Obama's drone strikes
“When Obama accepted the Nobel Peace Prize in December 2009, he had authorized more drone strikes than George W. Bush had approved during his entire presidency. By his third year in office, Obama had approved the killings of twice as many suspected terrorists as had ever been imprisoned (at) Guantanamo Bay,” Newsweek reported.
Obama practically invented modern push-button warfare, for goodness’ sake! Eventually, the American people will have to choose between partisan disingenuousness or rank stupidity to explain Democratic reaction to Trump’s perfectly precedented decisions.
On Iran, Trump made a bold choice and sent a strong message that we aren’t going to take the regime’s provocations and hostility anymore. Obama sent them pallets of cash. Trump sent an MQ-9 Reaper.
Anyone who knows how this will all shake out is lying. They don’t. But the commander in chief took out the world’s most notorious terrorist, one with plenty of American blood on his hands. Trump is the good guy here, not the terrorist.
Yet, Democrats couldn’t wait to pounce. How many statements included perfunctory “yeah, Soleimani was a bad guy, but … ” construction before hammering Trump?
Here’s a pro tip: If your statement has a “but” in the middle (I’m looking at you, Elizabeth Warren), just eliminate the throat-clearing, political pablum that came before it and say what you really mean. We get it: Iranian Guy Bad, Orange Man Worse.
This attitude will cost Democrats in the upcoming election. Not just on foreign policy, but across the board (they speak of the economy as though we are in another Great Depression). They just can’t give Trump an inch no matter how safe or prosperous the world is, thanks at least in part to the president’s decisions.
It hasn’t always been this way. After the death of Osama bin Laden, Republicans praised Obama’s decision to get him.
“Former Vice President Dick Cheney declared, ‘The administration clearly deserves credit for the success of the operation. ’ New York’s former mayor, Rudolph W. Giuliani, said, ‘I admire the courage of the president. ’ And Donald J. Trump declared, ‘I want to personally congratulate President Obama,’ ” according to The New York Times.
But no such allowance is given to President Trump when he kills a terrorist. As commentator Guy Benson tweeted, “The U. S. auto industry is alive, and (Abu Bakr) Baghdadi/Soleimani are dead,” referencing the Islamic State leader Trump had killed a few months ago and recalling Obama’s reelection slogan.
Or, as Rod Serling might say, “Democrats will soon wake up from their amnesia to an old lesson: Past is prologue. And it’s a Shakespearean seminar most acutely taken … in The Twilight Zone. ”

Media ignore toll caused by marijuana

Texto completo: I've covered things that injure, sicken and kill kids and adults for more than 30 years. From auto safety to medical errors, I've competed to break stories on the latest deadly defect or health policy change, most recently on electronic cigarettes. In late August, I added vaping-related lung illnesses to the beat. Last month, I added marijuana, psychosis and other mental illnesses.
It's a pretty solitary place to be.
A search on the news archive Nexis shows that the number of stories mentioning "vaping" and "lung illness" went from 953 in September to 584 in October, a nearly 40% drop.
The deaths and injuries from lung illnesses are declining, but they've hardly abated and are clearly a sign of a much larger problem with excessive marijuana use among young people. Yet families from the D'Ambrosios in California to the Donats in Connecticut were caught unaware.
Ricky D'Ambrosio, 21, was in a medically induced coma for four of the 10 days he was hospitalized in August after vaping THC from a dispensary. He had a medical marijuana card.
D'Ambrosio is recovering well now, but my Connecticut high school friend Billy Donat's family wasn't so lucky.
Last week, Donat emailed me for the first time: "Sometimes we reach out to old friends at the worst of times, this is one of those times. On Christmas Day, my son of 22 years put an electric cord around his neck and hung himself one day after his release from Yale Psychiatric Hospital. On the table in the living room was a copy (of) USA Today dated 12/16/2019. I told my son that you had written an article about his condition linking pot to psychosis. SCHIZOPHRENIA. I had read the front page at the news stand. I wish I had turned to page 6 and finished the article."
If he had, he would have seen that the federal "mental health czar" and psychiatrist, Elinore McCance-Katz, lamenting how little attention the "settled science" on pot and psychosis gets and the huge increase in suicides among young people with marijuana in their systems in Colorado.
A week ago, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said 2,561 people have been hospitalized with vaping-related lung illness and 55 have died. That's one more death and over 50 more hospitalizations from two weeks earlier.
CDC said 80% of hospitalized patients who had complete information about their products reported vaping THC; 13% said they vaped just nicotine.
Most everyone I talk to — even some doctors — say nicotine vaping and Juul, especially, is what's clogging kids' lungs. If it is, it hasn't been identified by the many scientists who have reported their findings. They have only been able to find vitamin E acetate from THC oil in the patients' lungs.
There has been an outcry to ban flavored electronic cigarettes and Congress voted to raise the age for all e-cigarette products to 21 last month. The Trump administration has announced plans to restrict most flavors of the one-time-use pods in e-cigarettes.
But what about when the industry isn't an easily identified and demonized monolith like Big Tobacco or ... Juul? What if the purported problem is something advocates have been trying to get mandated or legalized for years?
Former New York Times business reporter Alex Berenson says that the human cost of cannabis is too high — and that the press is too pro-pot. When his latest book, "Tell Your Children: The Truth about Marijuana, Mental Illness and Violence," came out last year, he knew marijuana proponents wouldn't like it. He just didn't think there would be what he calls a "media brownout": No major publications reviewed it. (USA TODAY interviewed him for a March article.)
Berenson, who didn't have strong feelings about marijuana legalization until he researched his book, has become an unlikely favorite of conservatives. He blames what he says is "a genuine misunderstanding of the strength of the science supporting the cannabis-psychosis link," which is worsened by "the endless industry/advocacy yelling about 'Reefer Madness.'"
"Reefer Madness" was a 1936 movie that used crazed marijuana users to show the purported risks of the drug.
"The cannabis lobby ... will personally attack anyone who tries to raise the issue," Berenson says.
Last month, the National Institute on Drug Abuse reported new data showing that marijuana use by students was way up — with 1 in 5 high-school seniors vaping it in the past year.
The recent story I wrote with colleagues on marijuana's link to mental health ran on the front page and was one of the top stories on our website for days. More than 250 people with children or personal experience with mental illness linked to marijuana joined our Facebook support group — I Survived It.
I don't know about you, but that makes me pay attention.

Texto completo: The Trump administration is knowingly putting vulnerable children in harm's way. Disturbing reports from the border are revealing the human consequences of the administration's "Remain in Mexico" policy, which forces children and families seeking asylum in the United States to wait for their court hearings in Mexican border towns — some of the most dangerous places on earth.
Horrific stories of the dangers children face in these towns have surfaced. A recent New York Times story described a 3-year-old boy who witnessed his father being beaten by kidnappers. Another 3-year-old was forced to watch as multiple attackers repeatedly raped his mother. Since January, according to a Dec. 5 Human Rights First report, there have been at least 636 documented cases of violent attacks, including kidnapping and rape, against migrants sent back to Mexico by the U.S. government.
As psychiatrists, we know this kind of trauma carries profound consequences for these children and we cannot stand idly by while the Trump administration forces the most vulnerable among us into unthinkable situations. The children whom the Trump administration is sending back to unspeakable violence in Mexican border towns are at risk for serious traumatic reactions and dysfunction that could impact them for the rest of their lives.
Decades of research have catalogued the neurobiological and psychological consequences of trauma on children's brains. It is estimated that 1.8 million synapses are formed on average per second in infants and toddlers. This stage of life is a critical time of development for children, during which the foundation for emotional and behavioral regulation and learning is built.
Exposing these children to brutal attacks on family members, while they are living in stressful and traumatizing environments, makes them prone to regress to earlier developmental stages and potentially lose bladder control, stop speaking, cry uncontrollably and even lose touch with reality. And the consequences of such trauma will continue into adulthood when they will be more likely to become angry, anxious, aggressive and dysfunctional adults.
But there is hope for these children if the Trump administration changes course. We know that the key to healing traumatized children is a safe and stable living environment and the support of a caring parent or adult. Ending the "Remain in Mexico" policy and allowing children and families seeking asylum to wait in the United States for their court hearings would prevent any more harm as a result of U.S. government policy and offer these children a chance at healing. If we remember our humanity, we may be able to undo some of the damage done.
As physicians and human beings, we are compelled to speak up and demand that our government stops forcing children and families into danger that will haunt them, and us, for the rest of their lives.
Most of these families are facing dire circumstances in their home countries and no parent risks a journey this dangerous unless they are running from a situation even more dangerous.
As these children and parents arrive at our doorstep seeking asylum, as is their legal right, it is wrong for this administration to knowingly place them in dangerous environments when safe alternatives exist and their presence in the United States has no negative impact on our society. It is our duty to protect them.

Texto completo: Americans would be wise to brace for war with Iran.
Full-scale conflict is not a certainty, but the probability is higher than at any point in decades. Despite President Trump’s oft-professed desire to avoid war with Iran and withdraw from military entanglements in the Middle East, his decision to order the killing of Maj. Gen. Qassim Soleimani, Iran’s second most important official, as well as Iraqi leaders of an Iranian-backed militia, now locks our two countries in a dangerous escalatory cycle that will likely lead to wider warfare.
How did we get here? What are the consequences of these targeted killings? Can we avoid a worse-case scenario?
The escalatory cycle began in May 2018, when President Trump recklessly ignored the advice of his national security team and the opposition of our allies in unilaterally withdrawing from the Iran nuclear deal — despite Iran’s full adherence to its terms and its efficacy in rolling back Iran’s nuclear program. Since then, the Trump administration has had no coherent strategy to constrain Iran’s program or to counter other aspects of its nefarious behavior.
Mr. Trump’s “maximum pressure campaign” to impose ever more debilitating economic sanctions did not force Iran to capitulate; instead, predictably, it induced Tehran to lash out with a series of increasingly bold military provocations against Sunni Arab and Western targets while restarting important aspects of its nuclear program. Iran’s destabilizing activities in the region, notably in Syria, Yemen and Lebanon, have only intensified. At the same time, it has conducted a brutal crackdown on its civilian population. None of the Trump administration’s stated objectives have been met; if anything, the United States’ security and strategic positions in the region have weakened.
In deciding to eliminate General Soleimani, Mr. Trump and his team argue they were acting in self-defense to thwart imminent attacks on Americans in Iraq and the region. This may be true, as General Soleimani was a ruthless murderer and terrorist with much American blood on his hands. Unfortunately, it’s hard to place confidence in the representations of an administration that lies almost daily about matters large and small and, even in this critical instance, failed to brief, much less consult, bipartisan leaders in Congress.
Second, even if the killing of General Soleimani is justified by self-defense, it doesn’t make it strategically wise. Given the demonstrably haphazard and shortsighted nature of the Trump administration’s national security decision-making process (including calling off strikes against Iran 10 minutes before impact, inviting the Taliban to Camp David and abandoning the Kurds), it’s doubtful the administration spent much time gaming out the second and third order consequences of their action or preparing to protect American military and diplomatic personnel in the region.
To assess the fallout of killing General Soleimani, we must understand that the Iranian regime cannot survive internal dissent or sustain its powerful position in the region if it backs down from this provocation. For Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, a strong response is essential. For the United States, the question is: What form will it take and how quickly will it come? One thing is clear: Americans are not safer, as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo argued on Fox News the morning after. Rather, American citizens are at greater risk of attack across a far wider battlefield than before.
Start with Iraq. The State Department has warned American citizens not to travel there. Iranian-backed militias have attacked United States and allied installations, and can continue to do so around the country. The government in Baghdad has declared the killing a violation of the terms of the American military presence in Iraq. We will face mounting pressure to withdraw our military and diplomatic personnel from the country. If we leave, the United States will suffer a major strategic defeat: Iran will justifiably claim victory, and the gains of the fight against ISIS will be lost as the terrorist group rebuilds.
There is no hope now to revive, much less strengthen, the Iran nuclear deal, and we must expect Iran will accelerate its efforts to revive its nuclear program without constraint.
The global economy is imperiled, as the Gulf States’ energy infrastructure faces the risk of an Iranian attack, and commercial shipping through the Strait of Hormuz and the larger Gulf region is threatened.
United States military, diplomatic and commercial operations as well as civilian targets throughout the Middle East are in range of both Iranian missiles and terrorist cells. From Afghanistan and Europe to Africa and Latin America, Iranian proxies — once latent — can stage asymmetric attacks against American and allied targets without warning. Even in the United States, we have reason to fear that terrorist sleeper cells could be activated. Worse, we face these threats now substantially alone, as the Trump administration apparently neglected to consult or even warn our key allies and partners about the impending risks to their interests that result from killing General Soleimani.
In the face of Iranian reprisals, it will be difficult for the United States to de-escalate tensions and avoid a larger conflict. Iran gets the next move. The United States has failed to deter Tehran thus far, even with the deployment of 14,000 additional American troops to the Gulf region since May. The announcement this week that the Pentagon was sending 3,500 more soldiers from the 82nd Airborne Division seems unlikely to change things.
When Iran does respond, its response will likely be multifaceted and occur at unpredictable times and in multiple places. President Trump will then face what may yet be the most consequential national security decision of his presidency. If he reacts with additional force, the risk is great that the confrontation will spiral into a wider military conflict. If he fails to react in kind, he will likely invite escalating Iranian aggression.
It’s hard to envision how this ends short of war.

Texto completo: They come in the night: Drones -- lots of them -- flying in precise formations over the Colorado and Nebraska prairie.
Whose are they? Unknown.
Why are they there? Unclear.
"It's creepy," said Missy Blackman, who saw three drones hovering over her farm outside Palisade, Nebraska, on a recent evening, including one that lingered right above her house. "I have a lot of questions of why and what are they, and nobody seems to have any answers."
Since before Christmas, sheriff's departments in the region have been bombarded with reports of large drones with blinking lights and wingspans of up to 6 feet flying over rural towns and open fields. The drones have unnerved residents, prompted a federal investigation and made international news, even though they may be perfectly legal.
And still, they remain unexplained.
"In terms of aircraft flying at night and not being identified, this is a first for me personally," said Sheriff James Brueggeman of Perkins County, Nebraska, who has worked in law enforcement for about 28 years and who saw the drones while on patrol one night.
He said he had heard rumblings about people wanting to shoot down a drone, and had urged residents to report the sightings to law enforcement instead. "I think it's kind of a joke, but you have to remember the part of the country we live in," the sheriff said. "People here don't like their privacy to be invaded."
The flights have drawn attention just as the Federal Aviation Administration recently proposed sweeping new regulations that would require most drones to be identifiable. Ian Gregor, a spokesman for the FAA, said that the timing of the proposed rule was coincidental, but that the agency had opened an investigation of the sightings in Colorado and Nebraska.
"Multiple FAA divisions and government agencies are investigating these reports," Gregor said in an email. He declined to discuss the inquiry in detail.
On Facebook, 911 dispatch lines and local newspaper columns, the drones have been the talk of rural Colorado and Nebraska. And as sightings increase -- people in four counties said they had seen them on Dec. 31 -- so too does the urgency of residents' questions.
Some have suggested they might be part of a simple mapping operation, or a land survey conducted by an oil and gas company -- but why would such flights run at night?
Sen. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., said on social media that he would "closely monitor the situation." A newspaper headline in Akron, Colorado, asked, "What's with the drones?" Multiple law enforcement agencies warned residents that shooting a drone out of the sky would be a crime.
"They're high enough where you couldn't shoot one anyway, but they're low enough that they're a nuisance," said Dawn George, who lives near Wray, Colorado, who said her border collie has barked at the drones when they fly over her property.
George said she had heard wild speculation about who might be responsible for the flights -- the government? a cartel? a gas company? -- and feared they would never know the truth.
"All the sudden, it's just going to stop and we're not going to have answers," George said. "And that's very unsettling to a lot of people. It's the fear of the unknown."
Unmanned drones, which have exploded into popular usage in recent years and can be used for everything from mapping to photography to farming, can be difficult to track. Operators of all but the smallest drones have been required to register with the federal government since 2015, but there is no straightforward, legal way for state and local officials to identify the owner of a particular drone or to track that drone's location.
"Like in many other areas of drone regulation, the statutory and regulatory framework is lagging the technology," said Reggie Govan, a former chief counsel to the FAA who now teaches at the University of Pennsylvania Law School.
Govan said federal officials have tracking tools to figure out where the Colorado and Nebraska drones were coming from, but that the vast area over which the drones were operating could make that task difficult.
Limitations in drone detection have allowed rogue drone operators to approach the White House without raising alarms and, in another extreme case, to deploy homemade bombs in a Pennsylvania neighborhood. Though it was not clear that the drones flying over Colorado and Nebraska were violating the law, residents and local officials said they would welcome the proposed new FAA rule that would make it easier to identify drones.
"Most people are very reasonable, and they say it could be somebody mapping or doing topography," said Michael Yowell, a sheriff's captain in Lincoln County, Colorado, whose house was buzzed over by a drone squadron on New Year's Eve. "But you can't rule out what you don't know."
The drone sightings started in northeast Colorado around mid-December and have only grown more widespread since then. Almost all the sightings have occurred between sunset and about 10 p.m., though Blackman said she had seen them out later one night in Nebraska. She said she had looked at them through binoculars and did not see any markings, just plain silver and white coloring.
Across the state line in Colorado, Yowell tried to photograph the drones with the camera he uses to document crime scenes, but came away without a clear image. He estimated that up to 30 drones were flying each night, though not all in the same place.
He said local officials were studying the flight path of the drones and coordinating across county lines to figure out where they were coming from. If his analysis was correct, he said, the drones would be back out on Wednesday night, flying in a grid pattern in the rural area between Hugo and Karval, Colorado, about 100 miles southeast of Denver.
"We want to know, at around 10 o'clock, when we start to lose visuals of these, which direction are they homing? Which way are they heading?" Yowell said. "We hope that's how we can contact somebody on the ground."
Sheriff Todd Combs of Yuma County, Colorado, said in a Facebook post that the drones appeared to be staying at least 150 feet from buildings or people, based on the footage he has seen.
"There are many theories about what is going on, but at this point, that's all they are," he said. "I think we are all feeling a little bit vulnerable due to the intrusion of our privacy that we enjoy in our rural community, but I don't have a solution."

Texto completo: Removing the tiny eyes that pockmark potatoes is dull, repetitive and time-consuming work -- perfect, it would seem, for robots in a country where the population is declining and workers are increasingly in short supply.
But it's not so simple.
When a food processing plant that makes potato salad and stews in Hokkaido, Japan's northernmost island, tried out a robot prototype designed to remove the potatoes' eyes, the machine was not up to the task.
The robot's camera sensors were not sensitive enough to identify every eye. While human hands can roll a potato in every direction, the robot could rotate the vegetables on only one axis and so failed to dig out many of the blemishes that are toxic to humans. Other perfectly good pieces were carved away.
"Fundamentally, it could not do the work to the standard of humans," said Akihito Shibayama, a factory manager at Yamazaki Group, which operates the plant in Asahikawa, a midsize city in Hokkaido where 30 workers process about 15 tons of potatoes a day.
Japan, the world's third-largest economy, hopes that robots and other types of automation will help solve its demographic problems and impending labor shortage.
But businesses are struggling as some jobs that seem ripe for a robotic takeover prove remarkably difficult to outsource to a machine.
Robots can "perform simple tasks but not tasks that require judgment or the ability to evaluate a change in a situation," said Toshiya Okuma, associate director of global strategy in the robot business division of Kawasaki Heavy Industries, a leading Japanese developer of robotics that has long helped automate car factory assembly lines.
Still, however hospitable Japanese businesses have been to robots, they have learned that robots able to perform somewhat sophisticated tasks cost much more than human workers.
At the factory in Asahikawa, where about 60% of the work is automated, many tasks still require the human touch. Workers peel pumpkins, for example, because some skin enhances the flavor of stew. A robot can't determine just how much skin to shuck off.
Helping drive the interest in robots are concerns about the declining population in Japan, where births are at their lowest level since 1874. Already industries, including manufacturing, are starting to run low of workers.
In Japan, "instead of displacing workers, you are simply replacing workers," said Todd Sneider, deputy division chief for the Japan division of the International Monetary Fund.
Although a bill was passed last year to grant new visas to foreign workers to help cope with shortages, the government has consistently emphasized robots as more likely saviors.
"So where you would potentially have immigrants doing the jobs, you say, 'Go make robots,' " said Selma Sabanovic, a professor of cognitive science at Indiana University who was a visiting scholar at the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology in Tsukuba, Japan.
Business leaders have expressed doubts that foreigners could quickly solve Japan's need for workers.
"Japan has kind of a very pure-blood race," said Noritsugu Uemura, an executive in charge of government and external relations for Mitsubishi Electric, a leading electronics manufacturer. "I think not only could it take 20 or 30 years, but it will take more like 40 or 50 years to integrate immigrants into Japan."

Texto completo: Fallen movie mogul Harvey Weinstein was hit with even more sexual assault charges Monday on the eve of a high-profile Manhattan rape trial against him that will give his seemingly endless list of accusers their long-awaited day in court.
Weinstein is now an accused criminal on both coasts after prosecutors in Los Angeles filed rape and sexual assault charges against the onetime Hollywood bigwig whose alleged atrocities against scores of women made him the ugly face of the viral #MeToo movement.
Braced by a walker and members of his legal team, Weinstein had just shuffled in and out of Manhattan Supreme Court when another prosecutor 3,000 miles away announced charges against him similar to the ones on which a New York jury will decide.
"We believe the evidence will show that the defendant used his power and influence to gain access to his victims and then commit violent crimes against them," said Los Angeles County District Attorney Jackie Lacey.
"Once the defendant's case is completed in New York, we expect him to appear in a courtroom in Los Angeles County to face the charges."
Lacey said Weinstein was charged with one felony count each of forcible rape, forcible oral copulation, sexual penetration by use of force and sexual battery by restraint for "raping one woman and sexually assaulting another in separate incidents over a two-day period in 2013."
According to a criminal complaint, Weinstein went to a Los Angeles hotel on Feb. 18, 2013, and raped a woman after pushing his way inside her room. A day later, according to court papers, Weinstein sexually assaulted a different woman at a hotel suite in Beverly Hills.
A Weinstein representative did not immediately comment on the new accusations.
Weinstein has denied any wrongdoing, and his attorneys have painted most of the encounters as consensual.
L.A. prosecutors are recommending bail be set at $5 million If convicted as charged, Weinstein faces up to 28 years in a California prison.
Weinstein, leaning on a walker, had limped out of a Manhattan courtroom just moments before news emerged of the West Coast charges.
But his defense team, arguing earlier to the judge that the New York jury should be sequestered for the entirety of the trial, had hinted at the possibility that additional criminal charges might be in the offing.
"We talked about a possible sequestration of the jury just based on all of the media attention this case is obviously getting," defense attorney Donna Rotunno said. "The fact that there is a potential L.A. situation going on - and based on the fact that we don't have any information about that - we are anticipating that if this were to happen as the trial unfolds, what that may look like."
Just hours before the news of the likely L.A. indictment surfaced, Weinstein's lawyer Damon Cheronis said that if West Coast prosecutors were to announce charges on Monday "the timing would be very suspect."
Lacey called the timing "coincidental."
"This was the first business day we could get everyone together," Lacey said.
In Manhattan, Rotunno said she hoped a fair jury would avoid a rush to judgment.
"In this great country, you are innocent until proven guilty," Rotunno said.
Several women who claim to have been abused by Weinstein also spoke outside the New York courthouse Monday.
"Dear Harvey, no matter what lies you tell yourself, you did this," said actress Rose McGowan, who claims Weinstein raped her in the 1990s. "You brought this upon yourself by hurting so many."
"I've worked 20 years trying to make a name for myself as a journalist," said reporter Lauren Sivan, who claims the ex-Hollywood honcho once masturbated in front of her in a restaurant and ejaculated onto a plant. "But nowadays most people know me as the 'potted plant girl,' because of my accidental encounter with Harvey Weinstein."
Jury selection is set to start Tuesday, more than two years after the allegations first came to light and sparked the groundbreaking, game-changing #MeToo movement.
In New York, Weinstein faces charges of first- and third-degree rape, criminal sex in the first degree and two counts of predatory sexual assault.
If convicted of the top charge of predatory sex assault in the first degree, Weinstein could spend the rest of his life in prison.
Weinstein was arrested on May 25, 2018 after he was accused by his former production assistant Mimi Haleyi of performing forcible oral sex on her during a harrowing 2006 encounter in his Manhattan apartment.
Prosecutors have also charged the "Shakespeare in Love" producer with raping a separate woman, whose identity has remained anonymous, in a Manhattan hotel room in March 2013.
"The Sopranos" actress Anabella Sciorra is expected to testify during the mammoth trial about Weinstein allegedly raping her 26 years ago. The jury will also hear from a number of unnamed women who have told of similar disturbing incidents occurring between 2006 and 2013.
More than 90 women globally have accused Weinstein of nonconsensual sex, and, in some cases, violent sexual encounters since The New York Times and The New Yorker first published some of the allegations about the mega-producer in October 2017.
Lacey said the statute of limitations prevented Los Angeles prosecutors from charging Weinstein with more crimes.
"Sexual assault cases are among the most challenging to prosecute," Lacey said.
"Just because we may lack sufficient evidence, it does not mean that a crime did not occur. To those victims, I want you to know we see you, we hear you and we believe you."

Texto completo: They come in the night: Drones - lots of them - flying in precise formations over the Colorado and Nebraska prairie.
Whose are they? Unknown.
Why are they there? Unclear.
"It's creepy," said Missy Blackman, who saw three drones hovering over her farm outside Palisade, Nebraska, on a recent evening, including one that lingered right above her house. "I have a lot of questions of why and what are they, and nobody seems to have any answers."
Since before Christmas, sheriff's departments in the region have been bombarded with reports of large drones with blinking lights and wingspans of up to 6 feet flying over rural towns and open fields. The drones have unnerved residents, prompted a federal investigation and made international news, even though they may be perfectly legal.
And still, they remain unexplained.
"In terms of aircraft flying at night and not being identified, this is a first for me personally," said Sheriff James Brueggeman of Perkins County, Nebraska, who has worked in law enforcement for about 28 years and who saw the drones while on patrol one night.
He said he had heard rumblings about people wanting to shoot down a drone, and had urged residents to report the sightings to law enforcement instead. "I think it's kind of a joke, but you have to remember the part of the country we live in," the sheriff said. "People here don't like their privacy to be invaded."
The flights have drawn attention just as the Federal Aviation Administration recently proposed sweeping new regulations that would require most drones to be identifiable. Ian Gregor, a spokesman for the FAA, said that the timing of the proposed rule was coincidental, but that the agency had opened an investigation of the sightings in Colorado and Nebraska.
"Multiple FAA divisions and government agencies are investigating these reports," Gregor said in an email. He declined to discuss the inquiry in detail.
On Facebook, 911 dispatch lines and local newspaper columns, the drones have been the talk of rural Colorado and Nebraska. And as sightings increase - people in four counties said they had seen them on Dec. 31 - so too does the urgency of residents' questions.
Some have suggested they might be part of a simple mapping operation, or a land survey conducted by an oil and gas company - but why would such flights run at night?
Sen. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., said on social media that he would "closely monitor the situation." A newspaper headline in Akron, Colorado, asked, "What's with the drones?" Multiple law enforcement agencies warned residents that shooting a drone out of the sky would be a crime.
"They're high enough where you couldn't shoot one anyway, but they're low enough that they're a nuisance," said Dawn George, who lives near Wray, Colorado, who said her border collie has barked at the drones when they fly over her property.
George said she had heard wild speculation about who might be responsible for the flights - the government? a cartel? a gas company? - and feared they would never know the truth.
"All the sudden, it's just going to stop and we're not going to have answers," George said. "And that's very unsettling to a lot of people. It's the fear of the unknown."
Unmanned drones, which have exploded into popular usage in recent years and can be used for everything from mapping to photography to farming, can be difficult to track. Operators of all but the smallest drones have been required to register with the federal government since 2015, but there is no straightforward, legal way for state and local officials to identify the owner of a particular drone or to track that drone's location.
"Like in many other areas of drone regulation, the statutory and regulatory framework is lagging the technology," said Reggie Govan, a former chief counsel to the FAA who now teaches at the University of Pennsylvania Law School.
Govan said federal officials have tracking tools to figure out where the Colorado and Nebraska drones were coming from, but that the vast area over which the drones were operating could make that task difficult.
Limitations in drone detection have allowed rogue drone operators to approach the White House without raising alarms and, in another extreme case, to deploy homemade bombs in a Pennsylvania neighborhood. Though it was not clear that the drones flying over Colorado and Nebraska were violating the law, residents and local officials said they would welcome the proposed new FAA rule that would make it easier to identify drones.
"Most people are very reasonable, and they say it could be somebody mapping or doing topography," said Michael Yowell, a sheriff's captain in Lincoln County, Colorado, whose house was buzzed over by a drone squadron on New Year's Eve. "But you can't rule out what you don't know."
The drone sightings started in northeast Colorado around mid-December and have only grown more widespread since then. Almost all the sightings have occurred between sunset and about 10 p.m., though Blackman said she had seen them out later one night in Nebraska. She said she had looked at them through binoculars and did not see any markings, just plain silver and white coloring.
Across the state line in Colorado, Yowell tried to photograph the drones with the camera he uses to document crime scenes, but came away without a clear image. He estimated that up to 30 drones were flying each night, though not all in the same place.
He said local officials were studying the flight path of the drones and coordinating across county lines to figure out where they were coming from. If his analysis was correct, he said, the drones would be back out on Wednesday night, flying in a grid pattern in the rural area between Hugo and Karval, Colorado, about 100 miles southeast of Denver.
"We want to know, at around 10 o'clock, when we start to lose visuals of these, which direction are they homing? Which way are they heading?" Yowell said. "We hope that's how we can contact somebody on the ground."
Sheriff Todd Combs of Yuma County, Colorado, said in a Facebook post that the drones appeared to be staying at least 150 feet from buildings or people, based on the footage he has seen.
"There are many theories about what is going on, but at this point, that's all they are," he said. "I think we are all feeling a little bit vulnerable due to the intrusion of our privacy that we enjoy in our rural community, but I don't have a solution."

A human's touch still needed Japan finds that robots have limitations for certain kinds of work

Texto completo: ASAHIKAWA, Japan - Removing the tiny eyes that pockmark potatoes is dull, repetitive and time-consuming work - perfect, it would seem, for robots in a country where the population is declining and workers are increasingly in short supply.
But it's not so simple.
When a food processing plant that makes potato salad and stews in Hokkaido, Japan's northernmost island, tried out a robot prototype designed to remove the potatoes' eyes, the machine was not up to the task.
The robot's camera sensors were not sensitive enough to identify every eye. While human hands can roll a potato in every direction, the robot could rotate the vegetables on only one axis and so failed to dig out many of the blemishes that are toxic to humans. Other perfectly good pieces were carved away.
"Fundamentally, it could not do the work to the standard of humans," said Akihito Shibayama, a factory manager at Yamazaki Group, which operates the plant in Asahikawa, a midsize city in Hokkaido where 30 workers process about 15 tons of potatoes a day.
Japan, the world's third-largest economy, hopes that robots and other types of automation will help solve its demographic problems and impending labor shortage.
But businesses are struggling as some jobs that seem ripe for a robotic takeover prove remarkably difficult to outsource to a machine.
Robots can "perform simple tasks but not tasks that require judgment or the ability to evaluate a change in a situation," said Toshiya Okuma, associate director of global strategy in the robot business division of Kawasaki Heavy Industries, a leading Japanese developer of robotics that has long helped automate car factory assembly lines.
Still, however hospitable Japanese businesses have been to robots, they have learned that robots able to perform somewhat sophisticated tasks cost much more than human workers.
At the factory in Asahikawa, where about 60% of the work is automated, many tasks still require the human touch. Workers peel pumpkins, for example, because some skin enhances the flavor of stew. A robot can't determine just how much skin to shuck off.
Helping drive the interest in robots are concerns about the declining population in Japan, where births are at their lowest level since 1874. Already industries, including manufacturing, are starting to run low of workers.
In Japan, "instead of displacing workers, you are simply replacing workers," said Todd Sneider, deputy division chief for the Japan division of the International Monetary Fund.
Although a bill was passed last year to grant new visas to foreign workers to help cope with shortages, the government has consistently emphasized robots as more likely saviors.
"So where you would potentially have immigrants doing the jobs, you say, 'Go make robots,' " said Selma Sabanovic, a professor of cognitive science at Indiana University who was a visiting scholar at the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology in Tsukuba, Japan.
Business leaders have expressed doubts that foreigners could quickly solve Japan's need for workers.
"Japan has kind of a very pure-blood race," said Noritsugu Uemura, an executive in charge of government and external relations for Mitsubishi Electric, a leading electronics manufacturer. "I think not only could it take 20 or 30 years, but it will take more like 40 or 50 years to integrate immigrants into Japan."

Texto completo: As tensions between the United States and Iran intensify after the killing of a top Iranian military commander, Iranian-Americans in Connecticut have followed the developing situation with apprehension and alarm.
Shahin Milani, 38, of Stamford, the legal director of the Iran Human Rights Documentation Center, a New Haven-based nonprofit, said Monday he and other members of the local Iranian community were "concerned about whether this could lead to an escalation of the events into a military conflict and hope that it doesn't come to that."
He emphasized that "people in Iran have no voice in this" and that opposition to the Iranian government is severely repressed in Iran.
Over the weekend, anti-war protesters assembled in cities across America, including more than 1,000 demonstrators outside the White House in Washington, to condemn the American airstrike. In New Haven on Sunday, about 100 people protested U.S. involvement in the Middle East.
Iran has vowed revenge for the U.S. attack that killed Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corp Commander Qassem Soleimani in an airstrike in Iraq on Friday. President Donald Trump turned to increasingly incendiary rhetoric over the weekend, including a threat Saturday on Twitter to destroy Iranian cultural sites if Iran attacked Americans or American assets. He said in the tweet that the U.S. has "targeted 52 Iranian sites (representing the 52 American hostages taken by Iran many years ago)."
For some members of the Iranian community in Connecticut worried about a looming military conflict, Trump's tweet was particularly concerning.
"I personally don't believe that the U.S. military will carry out such an attack but the very fact that the president would say something like that is very alarming, and it plays into the hand of the Iranian government," Milani said.
Kourosh Parsa, 59, of Stamford, the owner of a technical consulting company, said the deliberate targeting of cultural and historical sites, as Trump's tweet suggested, would be a violation of international law.
"Iranians don't like hitting the 52 cultural sites - even if they voted for Trump," he said.
Defense Secretary Mark Esper contracted Trump's tweet Monday, telling CNN the U.S. "will follow the laws of armed conflict. When asked if that meant not targeting Iranian cultural sites, he replied, "That's the laws of armed conflict."
Parsa added that he had wanted to see Soleimani tried in an international court for war crimes. Now, worried about a spiraling military conflict, he just hopes both countries will deescalate and work toward peace.
"This didn't help democracy and human rights in Iran," Parsa added.
U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal called Monday morning for Trump to declassify details about Soleimani's killing, including the notification that was sent to Congress about the airstrike. He and other Connecticut lawmakers have demanded more information from the Trump administration on the airstrike and voiced concerns about its ramifications across the Middle East.
"The administration has given us no facts - none - to justify the claim of an imminent attack or threat. That's the phrase that they repeated again and again and again," Blumenthal told reporters Monday at the state Capitol complex in Hartford. "Congress must be informed."
Top Trump officials are scheduled to brief the U.S. Senate Wednesday on the developing situation in Iraq and Iran, according to a Monday afternoon news report.
Blumenthal said later in the day that he had read the classified notification in Washington and found it lacking.
"There is absolutely no reason that it needs to be kept classified," he said. He added that he could not discuss its contents but said that "it was completely unsatisfying" and necessitated a public hearing.
In the wake of Soleimani's killing, security tightened at American borders and dozens of Iranians and Iranian-Americans were held for hours at Washington State's border with Canada, according to The New York Times.
Tark Aouadi, the executive director of CAIR-Connecticut - the local branch of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, a Muslim civil liberties organization - said that he had not heard from any Connecticut residents of Iranian descent who had been questioned or detained by border agents. But he added that the reports from Washington State were concerning.
"Any time that people are detained, there is concern and fear because we don't know what's going to happen," he said. "These are American citizens that have a right to travel guaranteed them by the Constitution."
The organization's Connecticut chapter recently published a "Know Your Rights" bulletin to inform Muslim Americans of their legal rights, Aouadi said. He added that CAIR chapter across the country are "monitoring the situation and we're here to support Americans who are experiencing these difficulties."
A proponent of deescalation and negotiation, Parsa said he has watched the rising tensions between the U.S. and Iran with dismay and is closely following each new development.
"I don't want us to get involved in a war in another country," he said. "Especially a country where I come from."

Texto completo: Beneath wind-swept palm trees and gilded chandeliers, President Donald Trump dined with Rush Limbaugh and congratulated Keith Hernandez, the New York Mets announcer and former first baseman, on his wedding. He consulted with his national security and campaign advisers while basking in 80-degree weather, and, as always, he tweeted.
He also authorized a military strike that has roiled the Middle East and is likely to endure as one of the most consequential acts of his presidency.
For three years, Trump's winter visits to Mar-a-Lago, his private club, have allowed him time to combine his personal and presidential business, often in the midst of the club's wealthy members and his adoring friends.
But the jarring juxtapositions this year seemed to highlight some central elements in the way Trump has governed: the little interest he has in planning beyond the day in front of him, his need for positive feedback and an unwillingness to modulate his behavior, whatever the circumstance.
From the outside, the president's two-week winter vacation in Palm Beach seemed similar to his previous long stays, except for the fact that he had recently been impeached.
The days were generally marked by casual-wear trips to his nearby golf club, where he would talk with members and meet with White House advisers. The evenings were marked by elaborate dinners at Mar-a-Lago that included his family members, his campaign advisers and his national security aides.
But Trump's vacation was more than the usual refuge from negative news coverage and official Washington. He was agitated by uncertainty about what comes next in the impeachment process, and expressed gnawing concerns about how much the billionaire Michael Bloomberg is spending on his campaign for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination in the election that Trump hopes to win.
Throughout Christmas week, the president watched the news coverage on impeachment and tweeted his frustrations with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi for slowing down the process by refusing to send to the Senate the articles charging him with high crimes and misdemeanors. He spoke with advisers about what the Senate trial might look like.
And there were other grievances, as well.
On Dec. 29, hours after a stabbing at the home of a rabbi in Monsey, New York, Trump, from his golf club in West Palm Beach, called one of his oldest acquaintances and major Jewish supporters, the cosmetics billionaire Ronald S. Lauder, to yell that Lauder should be doing more to "support" him, according to three people briefed on the call.
Lauder, the president of the World Jewish Congress who recently started a new $25 million effort to fight anti-Semitism that employs a pollster working for Bloomberg, listened as Trump ticked off a litany of administration actions. Trump said that he had done more for Jews than any other president and that he could still lose the Jewish vote. The president never mentioned campaign contributions, but advisers and others briefed on the call said he left the clear impression that was referring to financial support.
In a statement, Lauder would say only that he has had "many candid, positive and forward-looking conversations with" Trump, who "deserves a great deal of support from the Jewish community for his fantastic record on Israel and his proven support of the Jewish people here at home."
Then it was time to get back to White House work, and Trump huddled with advisers offering him a range of options on how to respond to the death of an American civilian contractor killed on Dec. 27 in a rocket attack on an Iraqi military base. The menu of choices included the most extreme one - killing Maj. Gen. Qassem Soleimani, Iran's most powerful commander.
On New Year's Eve, Trump hosted his annual party at Mar-a-Lago, arriving in a tuxedo with the first lady, Melania Trump, and playing MC to a crowd that included his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani.
On Jan. 2, the president began his day at his golf club. But mindful of not appearing weak in the face the rocket attack and concerned that an assault on the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad that U.S. officials said was orchestrated by Iran could have ended in devastation, Trump had already settled on a course of action.
In the middle of a meeting with campaign advisers, he left the table to give the final authorization to kill Soleimani. The president then returned, and, compartmentalizing what had just happened, resumed talking about the campaign.
It was an act of enormous consequence, but the White House made no public statement for hours, though the president cryptically tweeted about what had taken place. Whatever the administration's objectives were, and whatever intelligence they had used to justify the strike, it was not being shared in any conventional fashion.
Trump closely monitored reactions to his military action, taking note of who praised him publicly among Republicans and who did not, like Tucker Carlson, the Fox News host. He was encouraged by others on the Trump-friendly network.
But finally, on Friday afternoon, as he was about leave on a short helicopter ride to Miami for a campaign event with evangelical supporters, he abruptly agreed to make a statement on the strike.
His decision to speak came partly at the prodding of his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who had jumped in to try to direct the public response.
So aides draped one of the private dining rooms at Mar-a-Lago with a presidential blue cloth as a backdrop to the presidential podium. Roughly five minutes after he started talking, Trump was done.
Next up was Miami, and there, at the King Jesus International Ministry, he excoriated the "fake news," declared from the dais that two progressive congresswomen "hate" Jewish people, taunted the Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg for his faith, and said God was "on our side."
The president's final day of vacation, Saturday, was spent at the golf club, and was punctuated by a handful of tweets.
That night, Trump strolled through Mar-a-Lago, a phalanx of aides in tow, as Hernandez got married in an adjacent room, according to attendees. The president did not attend the wedding, but did offer congratulations.
Some people reached out to shake his hand or just to touch his arm as he passed their tables. For the second night, Trump heard approval from club members and their guests who thought he had acted decisively.
Less than 24 hours later, he began his return to Washington, where the temperature was much colder and the grind of his fourth year in office and his campaign for another term were just beginning.

At 91, Dr. Ruth still has zest for life Sex therapist's journey to household name detailed in production

Texto completo: I have questions for sex therapist Dr. Ruth, and my pulse quickens as I pick up the phone.
A busy signal.
Apparently Dr. Ruth K. Westheimer, who in the 1980s got Americans talking about everything from orgasms to orgies, still has a landline. Without call waiting.
The low-tech setup is probably designed to give the 91-year-old some peace - a defense against questions about masturbation, erectile dysfunction and other topics that before her radio show, television programs, newspaper columns and books were only whispered about, if they were spoken of at all.
"People find me in the street and tell me their problems," Westheimer says in her distinctive voice, high-pitched and German-accented. "But I'm grateful."
Westheimer's extraordinary life - from Holocaust survivor to Israeli sniper to household name - is detailed in Mark St. Germain's play, "Becoming Dr. Ruth." It opens at Orlando Shakes on Friday.
The play is what I have called to ask about - honestly! - but the good doctor has thoughts on today's sexual scene.
"The questions have changed," she says of those who seek her counsel. "They don't ask about premature ejaculation and how women can have an orgasm anymore. People know much more."
I suggest a whole generation knows more about their own bodies thanks to her teaching.
"I hope so," she proclaims. "There were others writing or talking about sex. But I certainly was a big part of it. And I was instrumental about talking about AIDS when no one else wanted to."
Her career in frank talk is how most people know her. When an actor first suggested to playwright St. Germain that the thrice-married diminutive doc would make a great subject for a play, he was skeptical.
"What? A 15-minute sketch about a talk show?" he remembers thinking. "Then I read about her life, and I was amazed."
But Westheimer wasn't interested.
"She said, 'Absolutely not,' " recalls St. Germain, whose acclaimed plays include "Freud's Last Session" and "Dancing Lessons." "I was kind of irritated. I felt too immediately dismissed."
Upon reflection, Westheimer had a change of heart. She liked St. Germain "right away." And she felt an obligation to those who didn't survive World War II.
"I have an obligation to talk about it," she says. "How lucky I am, how grateful I was saved. Hitler and the Nazis are dead. My four grandchildren are alive."
She says current affairs bring new resonance to her story.
"I want audiences to laugh but also to cry about the rise of Nazism, especially in today's world with anti-Semitism on the rise," she says.
Eileen DeSandre, an Oregon-based actor who stars in Orlando Shakes' production, says the play hits home for anyone who has faced trauma.
"She lost her family" when the youngster was put on a "Kindertransport," removing Jewish children from Nazi Germany to an orphanage in Switzerland, DeSandre said. "Her mother and grandmother took her to the train station, waved goodbye, and she never saw them again."
Young Karola Ruth Siegel, as she was born, already had witnessed the Nazis dragging her father away. After World War II, she emigrated to Palestine before the establishment of Israel. Because of her small stature, 4-foot-7, she was trained as a scout and a sniper in what would become the Israeli armed forces.
Israel is still important to her: She's proud that in May she'll receive an honorary doctorate from that nation's Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, where a psychology scholarship in her name is also being established (aabgu.org/Dr-Ruth). She laughs as she says she has a message for those who donate to the scholarship's endowment: "I promise they will have good sex for the rest of their lives."
After her stint in the Middle East, Westheimer lived in Paris before immigrating to the U.S. in 1956 and earning her master's and doctorate degrees. Even then, as a divorced woman she bucked convention.
"I was alive in the '50s, and you did not have single mothers in the '50s," DeSandre says. "But she was a single mother in the '50s without shame."
St. Germain says with Westheimer what you see is what you get: "I've never seen any personality but her real one."
The two became friends while he wrote the play. Then came the moment of truth.
"I had to read the whole thing to her," St. Germain says. "She only made two corrections - not about point of view, about locations I had wrong."
"Becoming Dr. Ruth" debuted in 2013, with The New York Times calling it "highly enjoyable" and "a design for living, as exemplified by a woman whose father told her always to be cheerful and happy."
Playing Westheimer is "a little terrifying," says DeSandre. "It's not an impersonation. It's not an imitation. It's an interpretation."
Westheimer won't travel from New York to see the local production. "I'll be teaching," she says; she lectures at Hunter College and Teachers College, Columbia University.
Her commitments don't surprise St. Germain. "She's unstoppable," he says. "She can walk faster than I can, she has more energy than I do."
If she should need mobility assistance, Westheimer knows where to turn.
"I take a young, good-looking guy with me instead of a cane," she quips.
She recently updated one of her myriad books.
"I put in some warnings that the art of conversation is getting lost" in the age of social media, she says. "It can lead to a lot of loneliness."
And though she's not opposed to finding sexual partners through phone apps or online services, she advises caution. "People can lie," she says bluntly.
2019 saw her inducted into the Radio Hall of Fame, as well as the release of the documentary film "Ask Dr. Ruth."
There's a reason the public remains interested in Westheimer, says St. Germain, and it's reflected in his play.
"It's a story about survival. There's humor, there's tragedy," St. Germain says. "She's had a lot of challenges, and she stayed true to herself. It's inspirational."

Texto completo: ASAHIKAWA, Japan - Removing the tiny eyes that pockmark potatoes is dull, repetitive and time-consuming work - perfect, it would seem, for robots in a country where the population is declining and workers are increasingly in short supply.
But it's not so simple.
When a food processing plant that makes potato salad and stews in Hokkaido, Japan's northernmost island, tried out a robot prototype designed to remove the potatoes' eyes, the machine was not up to the task.
The robot's camera sensors were not sensitive enough to identify every eye. While human hands can roll a potato in every direction, the robot could rotate the vegetables on only one axis and so failed to dig out many of the blemishes that are toxic to humans. Other perfectly good pieces were carved away.
"Fundamentally, it could not do the work to the standard of humans," said Akihito Shibayama, a factory manager at Yamazaki Group, which operates the plant in Asahikawa, a midsize city in Hokkaido where 30 workers process about 15 tons of potatoes a day.
Japan, the world's third-largest economy, hopes that robots and other types of automation will help solve its demographic problems and impending labor shortage.
But businesses are struggling as some jobs that seem ripe for a robotic takeover prove remarkably difficult to outsource to a machine.
Robots can "perform simple tasks but not tasks that require judgment or the ability to evaluate a change in a situation," said Toshiya Okuma, associate director of global strategy in the robot business division of Kawasaki Heavy Industries, a leading Japanese developer of robotics that has long helped automate car factory assembly lines.
Still, however hospitable Japanese businesses have been to robots, they have learned that robots able to perform somewhat sophisticated tasks cost much more than human workers.
At the factory in Asahikawa, where about 60% of the work is automated, many tasks still require the human touch. Workers peel pumpkins, for example, because some skin enhances the flavor of stew. A robot can't determine just how much skin to shuck off.
Helping drive the interest in robots are concerns about the declining population in Japan, where births are at their lowest level since 1874. Already industries, including manufacturing, are starting to run low of workers.
In Japan, "instead of displacing workers, you are simply replacing workers," said Todd Sneider, deputy division chief for the Japan division of the International Monetary Fund.
Although a bill was passed last year to grant new visas to foreign workers to help cope with shortages, the government has consistently emphasized robots as more likely saviors.
"So where you would potentially have immigrants doing the jobs, you say, 'Go make robots,' " said Selma Sabanovic, a professor of cognitive science at Indiana University who was a visiting scholar at the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology in Tsukuba, Japan.
Business leaders have expressed doubts that foreigners could quickly solve Japan's need for workers.
"Japan has kind of a very pure-blood race," said Noritsugu Uemura, an executive in charge of government and external relations for Mitsubishi Electric, a leading electronics manufacturer. "I think not only could it take 20 or 30 years, but it will take more like 40 or 50 years to integrate immigrants into Japan."

Texto completo: ASAHIKAWA, Japan - Removing the tiny eyes that pockmark potatoes is dull, repetitive and time-consuming work - perfect, it would seem, for robots in a country where the population is declining and workers are increasingly in short supply.
But it's not so simple.
When a food processing plant that makes potato salad and stews in Hokkaido, Japan's northernmost island, tried out a robot prototype designed to remove the potatoes' eyes, the machine was not up to the task.
The robot's camera sensors were not sensitive enough to identify every eye. While human hands can roll a potato in every direction, the robot could rotate the vegetables on only one axis and so failed to dig out many of the blemishes that are toxic to humans. Other perfectly good pieces were carved away.
"Fundamentally, it could not do the work to the standard of humans," said Akihito Shibayama, a factory manager at Yamazaki Group, which operates the plant in Asahikawa, a midsize city in Hokkaido where 30 workers process about 15 tons of potatoes a day.
Japan, the world's third-largest economy, hopes that robots and other types of automation will help solve its demographic problems and impending labor shortage.
But businesses are struggling as some jobs that seem ripe for a robotic takeover prove remarkably difficult to outsource to a machine.
Robots can "perform simple tasks but not tasks that require judgment or the ability to evaluate a change in a situation," said Toshiya Okuma, associate director of global strategy in the robot business division of Kawasaki Heavy Industries, a leading Japanese developer of robotics that has long helped automate car factory assembly lines.
Still, however hospitable Japanese businesses have been to robots, they have learned that robots able to perform somewhat sophisticated tasks cost much more than human workers.
At the factory in Asahikawa, where about 60% of the work is automated, many tasks still require the human touch. Workers peel pumpkins, for example, because some skin enhances the flavor of stew. A robot can't determine just how much skin to shuck off.
Helping drive the interest in robots are concerns about the declining population in Japan, where births are at their lowest level since 1874. Already industries, including manufacturing, are starting to run low of workers.
In Japan, "instead of displacing workers, you are simply replacing workers," said Todd Sneider, deputy division chief for the Japan division of the International Monetary Fund.
Although a bill was passed last year to grant new visas to foreign workers to help cope with shortages, the government has consistently emphasized robots as more likely saviors.
"So where you would potentially have immigrants doing the jobs, you say, 'Go make robots,' " said Selma Sabanovic, a professor of cognitive science at Indiana University who was a visiting scholar at the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology in Tsukuba, Japan.
Business leaders have expressed doubts that foreigners could quickly solve Japan's need for workers.
"Japan has kind of a very pure-blood race," said Noritsugu Uemura, an executive in charge of government and external relations for Mitsubishi Electric, a leading electronics manufacturer. "I think not only could it take 20 or 30 years, but it will take more like 40 or 50 years to integrate immigrants into Japan."

Texto completo: They say "hindsight is 2020." We're likely to see a lot of "hindsight" in 2020. John Durham, U.S. Attorney for the District of Connecticut, has been investigating the origin of the Russian collusion claim executed by former CIA Director John Brennan, former FBI Director James Comey, and former FBI counterintelligence agent Peter Strzok along with other high ranking officials inside the Obama administration.
In late July 2016, Brennan sent an "electronic communication" to Comey that essentially began "Operation Crossfire Hurricane," in which Brennan named four Trump campaign members as targets: George Papadopoulos, Carter Page, Paul Manafort, and Michael Flynn. Afterward Strzok officially opened the investigation with his signature on July 31.
News stories began popping up in respected organizations. The New York Times, Washington Post, and CNN routinely cited anonymous sources sometimes labeled "current and former American Officials" to buttress their stories about Trump and campaign aids having repeated contact with Russian intelligence officers. These stories were not true.
Even after Trump was inaugurated, the Associated Press reported March 21, 2017, "Before signing up with Donald Trump, former campaign manager Paul Manafort secretly worked for a Russian billionaire with a plan to 'greatly benefit the Putin Government.'" This story was not true. Unfortunately, many news organizations reported stories like these.
For more than two years, Americans were subjected to daily attacks on President Trump with "proof" at last of collusion and corruption. Finally, Special Counsel Robert Mueller completed his investigation and sent it to Attorney General William Barr. All the president's enemies waited breathlessly for a couple of weeks before Barr released the lightly redacted final report to Congress and the public.
Contrary to all the predictions, proofs and prognostications of the best minds on the Left in the media, politics and government, Mueller's team had found no collusion between Trump and the Russians. Finding no evidence of collusion raised two glaring questions: What evidence did Brennan, Comey, and Strzok have to begin the investigation? Why did they begin the investigation with no credible evidence?
After Mueller's report came out, ABC, CBS, and NBC increased news coverage on all things impeachment. Media Research Center senior editor, Rich Noyes wrote, "Despite the Mueller report's lack of an anti-Trump smoking gun, the broadcast networks actually became more invested in the Russia story. TV news viewers heard three times as many references to 'impeachment' compared to before Mueller concluded there was no campaign conspiracy with Russia...."
Impeachment has been a foregone conclusion of the Left since November 9, 2016. When Mueller's investigation fizzled, Democrats, some in the media and the political establishment began searching frantically for anything impeachable. Why this irrational obsession with impeaching President Trump? Plausibly, the Left believes they cannot defeat him in this year's election. Maybe there are other reasons than believing the electorate will re-elect President Trump.
U.S. Attorney John Durham may deliver evidence of criminal activity in the highest echelons of the Obama administration to the Department of Justice some time this year. Have forces inside the government been colluding to remove Trump from office? Could this collusion be treason? What is the penalty for treason? Is it true what the Democrats and some in the media have self-righteously pronounced that no one is above the law?

Trump was right on Iran

Texto completo: I have spent the last 20 or so New Years' Eves glued to the SyFy Channel's "Twilight Zone" marathon. My wife and I love the writing, the plots and picking out famous actors in their one-off roles for the classic television series.
Maybe I'll write an episode of my own, complete with a Rod Serling-worthy opening monologue:
"The year is 2017. Donald Trump is inaugurated as president of the United States, and mass amnesia has washed over America. Half the country can no longer remember anything that happened before Jan. 20. The former president, Barack Obama, is literally sitting right there. Yet, his own party cannot remember one thing about his eight years ..."
It is one of the strangest phenomena of the Trump era – the memory-holing of Obama's executive powers. Democrats continuously act as though they've just fallen off the Washington turnip wagon when Trump does anything.
Trump's illegal immigration policies are draconian! He's deporting too many, they screamed, forgetting that ... Obama deported more. A lot more. And, you know those cages on the southern border? Obama built them, not Trump.
Trump's defying congressional subpoenas! No president has ever stonewalled Congress, they screamed, forgetting that Obama's Attorney General, Eric Holder, was held in contempt of Congress for ... defying subpoenas related to the Fast and Furious scandal. There were at least eight other times when Obama's Administration defied congressional oversight, even preventing people from testifying (sound familiar?).
When Trump announced his "America First" policy during his inaugural, Democrats apparently took it as literally as one can.
Now, they howl over Trump's latest outrage: the airstrike that killed Iranian terrorist Qassem Soleimani, who was in Iraq fomenting attacks against the American embassy and, evidently, plotting future hits on American targets.
Washington Democrats whined about Trump authorizing a drone strike without their notification or consent. This, after Obama authorized at least 2,800 drone strikes in Iraq and Syria without congressional approval.
"When Obama accepted the Nobel Peace Prize in December 2009, he had authorized more drone strikes than George W. Bush had approved during his entire presidency. By his third year in office, Obama had approved the killings of twice as many suspected terrorists as had ever been imprisoned in Guantánamo Bay," Newsweek reported.
Obama practically invented modern push-button warfare, for goodness' sake! Eventually, the American people will have to choose between partisan disingenuousness or rank stupidity to explain Democratic reaction to Trump's perfectly precedented decisions.
On Iran, Trump made a bold choice and sent a strong message that we aren't going to take the regime's provocations and hostility anymore. Obama sent them pallets of cash. Trump sent an MQ-9 Reaper.
Anyone who knows how this will all shake out is lying. They don't. But the Commander-in-Chief took out the world's most notorious terrorist, one with plenty of American blood on his hands. Trump is the good guy here, not the terrorist.
Yet, Democrats couldn't wait to pounce. How many statements included perfunctory "yeah, Soleimani was a bad guy, but ..." construction before hammering Trump?
Here's a pro-tip: If your statement has a "but" in the middle (I'm looking at you, Elizabeth Warren), just eliminate the throat-clearing, political pablum that came before it and say what you really mean. We get it. Iranian Guy Bad, Orange Man Worse.
This attitude will cost Democrats in the upcoming election. Not just on foreign policy, but across the board (they speak of the economy as though we are in another Great Depression). They just can't give Trump an inch no matter how safe or prosperous the world is, thanks at least in part to the president's decisions.
It hasn't always been this way. After the death of Osama bin Laden, Republicans praised Obama's decision to get him.
"Former Vice President Dick Cheney declared, 'The administration clearly deserves credit for the success of the operation.' New York's former mayor, Rudolph W. Giuliani, said, 'I admire the courage of the president.' And Donald J. Trump declared, 'I want to personally congratulate President Obama,'" according to the New York Times.
But no such allowance is given to President Trump, even when he kills a terrorist arguably more consequential and certainly more dangerous than bin Laden himself. As commentator Guy Benson tweeted, "The US auto industry is alive, and Baghdadi/Soleimani are dead," referencing the ISIS leader Trump had killed a few months ago and recalling Obama's reelection slogan.
Or, as Mr. Serling might say, "Democrats will soon wake up from their amnesia to an old lesson: Past is prologue. And it's a Shakespearean seminar most acutely taken...in The Twilight Zone."

Film fest opening night grapples with Italy, gay marriage

Texto completo: With a focus on Italy as part of this year's offerings, the Palm Springs International Film Festival kicked off opening night with Simone Godano's feel-good Italian comedy, "An Almost Ordinary Summer."
Godano was the only representative from the film in attendance for Friday's screening, posing for photos and talking to media before heading inside the Richards Center for the Performing Arts at Palm Springs High School.
He joked that he traveled 24 hours for a 15-minute Q-and-A and warned of his lack of sleep.
"Sorry, it's six or seven in the morning for me," he said.
Godano's second feature film centers around two patriarchs — Carlo, a free spirited art dealer and Tony, a working class fisherman — who bring their families together to Tony's seaside villa to announce their impending nuptials. The two men, in previous relationships with women, planned to marry in three weeks after a secret relationship of more than a year.
But, as Carlo feared, his family isn't accepting of this same-sex marriage — especially his oldest son, Sandro. And while most of Tony's family is OK with it, his daughter Penelope is not. (Italy legalized same-sex civil unions in 2016, according to the New York Times, but the country does not recognize same-sex marriages.) So, she hatches a plan with the reluctant Sandro to sabotage their fathers' relationship.
In true rom-com fashion, slick moves and chicanery eventually work to break the pair up, as their class differences are used as a wedge between them. But, alas, love prevails despite family members' attitudes toward their sexuality.
Speaking through a translator, Godano said the movie initially focused on the two men and their sexual orientation, but then it evolved into more than that.
"As it developed, it was about the love of these two families," he said.
The overarching theme of the movie, Godano said, is "love is love" and "learning to accept the happiness of others."
During the Q-and-A, Godano, who spoke Italian, had difficulty at times answering questions and getting his points across through the translator. At one point, film festival Artistic Director Lili Rodriguez, who moderated the discussion, stepped in and started speaking to him in Spanish to help facilitate the conversation.
The movie was filmed in Gaeta at a beautiful cliffside villa overlooking the ocean.
Godano said the cast, which included top Italian actors, stayed there for two months during filming, which helped with the synergy.
He compared Fabrizio Bentivoglio, who played Tony, to British actor Daniel Day-Lewis and Alessandro Gassmann, who played Carlo, to funny guy Jim Carrey. And he compared Jasmine Trinca, who played Tony's daughter Penelope, to actress Emma Stone.
The opening night event was sponsored by IHG Hotels & Resorts, which includes the Kimpton brand in its line of hotels. For the movie, guests received complimentary miniature glass Coke bottles and popcorn.
The popcorn was a hit for fans, since Palm Springs High School has traditionally been one of the only film festival venues that doesn't serve popcorn.
While the Coke was an amusing and nostalgic refreshment, the result was a periodic glass bottle getting knocked over and hitting the ground throughout the movie, causing more than a few huffs as the bottles clinked on the hard floor.
The opening night after party was held at the Palm Springs Art Museum, with a traditional buffet dinner and open bar. This year, a fun addition was a wall of rosé, which literally had glasses of rosé wine attached to a wall of roses, enticing guests to walk up and pluck off a glass.
Several other Italian movies will be screened throughout the festival — from arthouse pieces to comedy — as part of A Focus on Italy programming.
Those films include: "The Champion," "The Disappearance of My Mother," "Martin Eden," "Simple Women," "Sole," "A Soul Journey" and "The Traitor."

TRUMP THREATENS WAR ON HUMANITY'S PAS

Texto completo: It's true that being impeached has emboldened President Donald Trump. He no longer cares that the world sees him as he truly is: petty, vindictive, narcissistic and as prideful as Lucifer in "Paradise Lost."
Because it takes a leap of faith to believe Mr. Trump is anything but the most self-dealing president in our nation's history, he no longer pretends to be anything than what he truly is - a thug from Queens.
Mr. Trump long ago liberated himself from the most rudimentary expectations of his office. Constitutional norms are so much wet toilet paper to him. Why should he have to formally consult with Congress or even our military allies before killing Iranian military commander Qassem Soleimani, thereby informally declaring war on Iran?
Isn't it the equivalent of advise-and-consent every time he tweets out a threat to Iran, North Korea or Venezuela? If members of Congress want to be briefed with the frequency of the tax-dodging yacht rats who swarm Mar-a-Lago whenever Mr. Trump is in town, they can follow him on Twitter like everyone else.
Those old enough to remember the Cuban Missile Crisis can probably feel a similar dread creeping up their spines as they take in Mr. Trump's threats and fulminations against Iran in recent days.
Though Mr. Trump was in his mid-teens when President John F. Kennedy squared off against Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev under a nuclear Sword of Damocles known as mutually assured destruction, the possibility of an apocalypse triggered by hubris or miscalculation wasn't a lesson the future president either appreciated or absorbed.
Donald Trump is no Jack Kennedy. He doesn't read. He doesn't have the capacity to reflect deeply on competing geo-political options. He is contemptuous of facts and has a simplistic view of what it takes to win at war and diplomacy.
Lacking empathy, it would never occur to him to give an enemy a face-saving way out of a crisis the way Kennedy did when he pulled U.S. missiles out of Turkey in exchange for the Russians not installing missiles in Cuba.
These days, Mr. Trump prefers the company of resentment, indifference to planning and bombast over what he considers the pretensions of statesmanship. After all, wild spontaneity and a predilection for cruelty have gotten him this far in 73 years.
In one of the more ominous tweets over the weekend, Mr. Trump warned that the U.S. has targeted 52 Iranian sites "some at a very high level&important to Iran&the Iranian culture."
"They attacked us,&we hit back. If they attack again, which I would strongly advise them not to do, we will hit them harder than they have ever been hit before!" he tweeted with the eye-for-an-eye logic that has always served the Middle East and its surrounding regions well.
The unspoken subtext to the Saturday night tweets features the kind of unapologetic gangsterism that could qualify as evidence of a war crime someday: "Say, those are 52 nice, ancient cultural sites you have over there, Iran. It would be a shame if something bad happened to them."
As if to underline his disdain for diplomacy, the consent of Congress or international norms, Mr. Trump tweeted on Sunday that his tweets "will serve as notification to the United States Congress that should Iran strike any U.S. person or target, the United States will quickly&fully strike back,&perhaps in a disproportionate manner."
When asked on Sunday to clarify whether he had targeted world heritage sites that stretch back to the earliest civilizations in mankind's history, he doubled down on the transactional rationale of such destruction as he sees it:
"They're allowed to kill our people, they're allowed to torture and maim our people, they're allowed to use roadside bombs and blow up our people, and we're not allowed to touch their cultural sites?" he said. "It doesn't work that way."
Well, so much for the "just war" theory so many evangelical and Catholic apologists of Mr. Trump's erratic foreign and military policies cling to when defending him.
In violation of international law and treaty, Mr. Trump has made it clear that if Iran or any of its proxies attack an American military base or convoy, then Persepolis, Susa and the historic city of Yazd are fair game. You would think war was barbaric enough without threatening to rain hellfire on civilians and the world's historic cultural sites, too.
The destruction of revered archaeological sites, some older than the Bible, is what ISIS and the Taliban do when they take over a region. This would've been an unimaginable threat coming from any Western leader prior to Donald Trump.
Because Mr. Trump has been impeached, he is full of rage even as his Republican enablers scheme to make sure he's not convicted in the Senate and removed from office. It's noteworthy that in advance of the trial in the Senate, no Republican is willing to defend him on the merits of his so-called "perfect phone call" to the president of Ukraine appealing for help in digging up dirt on his likely Democratic opponent, Joe Biden.
There is widespread suspicion that Mr. Trump is engaging in the sort of distraction he accused President Barack Obama of perpetrating in 2012. Back then in a series of tweets, he accused Mr. Obama of "wagging the dog" by plotting to attack Iran to win a second term and to bolster his standing with the American people. Now those same tweets are being used to troll him. Not only did Mr. Obama not attack Iran, he won a second term and negotiated the multilateral Iran nuclear deal with buy-in from allies and adversaries in the region. Only Iranian hardliners and congressional Republicans hated the deal.
Mr. Trump withdrew the U.S. from the deal in 2017 and reimposed crushing sanctions that have crippled Iran's economy. With the preemptive assassination of Suleimani, Iran has announced that it will no longer abide by any restrictions on its nuclear program. Meanwhile, the recent internal protests against the Iranian regime have turned outward toward the United States. In neighboring Iraq, the parliament has voted unanimously to expel the American military from the country, though no timeline was announced. In other words, Mr. Trump has casually injected George W. Bush-level chaos into the region.
Suddenly, a president who exhibited nothing but disdain for American intelligence a few weeks ago now insists that the latest U.S. intelligence on Suleimani dictated that he strike now before his latest plot could materialize. Americans have every right to be cynical of the Trump administration's claims, especially without tangible proof. Even Tucker Carlson at Fox News questioned the logic of the decision.
You don't have to be a Democrat or a liberal-progressive to see this conveniently timed assassination as an unacceptable risk when the commander-in-chief has as long a track record for lying as Mr. Trump does. Anyone who threatens to destroy irreplaceable parts of humanity's past to win an election already lacks the morality necessary to conduct a war.

Texto completo: All too frequently, when a partner kills his disabled loved one, we see it as an act of kindness or mercy.
When a man in Florida killed his wife, who had dementia, before killing himself, a friend said, "If it was a suicide-type thing, it was pure out of love and I'm sorry." When another Floridian fatally shot his wife before dying by suicide, his family described the murder as a "mercy killing." Her sister told First Coast News that "he could no longer bear to see her suffering" from dementia. And last week, New York Times journalist Corina Knoll described her report about Richard Shaver - who killed himself after killing Alma, his wife, who had Alzheimer's disease, while she slept - as a tale "of love." The headline called them "sweethearts forever."
In each of these stories, friends and loved ones frame the death as an end to the victim's suffering; the victim's own wishes rarely come up. In each case, the underlying assumption is that disabled people, particularly those with cognitive disabilities, are obviously better off dead.
Why do we listen to the laments of neighbors and family members about loving murderers and the difficulties of caring for disabled people? A Ruderman Family Foundation study described this framing as "killer-centered." The personhood and motivations of the killers are explored in detail, while their victims are quietly erased and the cultural contexts that fostered murders are hidden.
No federal agency keeps statistics on murder-suicides, but research indicates that the majority of them are perpetrated by men against their romantic partners, usually with a gun. The murders of disabled spouses are no different. Murder-suicides are often described as "mercy killings," and the difficulty of caregiving is often cited as a justification. But difficulty of this sort is impossible to assess (Shaver refused help getting a home aide or a house nearer to his daughter), and it is irrelevant: No amount of difficulty justifies the taking of a life.
It is a fundamentally paternalistic proposition to suggest that victims do not get a say in whether they live. Calling their deaths an act of love says their own desires are not valid and they cannot have a say about their own lives. Alzheimer's may rob its victims of their capacity to express their wills, but that doesn't mean they forfeit their agency. It certainly does not give someone else the right to determine whether they should forfeit their lives.
How we talk about disabled people's deaths shapes how society values disabled life. Describing a murder as loving and merciful allows men contemplating murdering their wives to believe that their schemes are normal. It signals that killers are justified or even praised for killing the people they purport to love.
The truth is that, many times, these murders are not evidence of selflessness but exhibit an inability to separate the perpetrators' needs from those of the victims. At a 2010 National Institute of Justice forum, Richard Gelles, a sociologist at the University of Pennsylvania, said perpetrators see their family members as things they control. This "overenmeshment" erases boundaries between their own identities and the identities of their wives and children. It is easy to erode those boundaries when disabled family members are already seen as less than human by society. It is even easier when the victim is vulnerable because of a disability. These murders aren't different from any other domestic abuse and should not be treated differently purely because of a physical condition.
Rather than focus on the killers, focus on the victims' humanity and speak and learn the context from disability organizations, such as Dementia Alliance International. These incidents are not acts of desperation or the natural outcome of an inadequate health care system. Murder-suicides involving disability occur because of a culture that devalues the lives of disabled people.

The Suleimani blowback; We don't know where the killing of the Iranian general will lead, but the early signs aren't promising.

Texto completo: Correction: Suleimani: An editorial Tuesday about the killing of an Iranian general incorrectly stated where protesters had recently besieged a U.S. embassy. It was in Baghdad, not Tehran.
Now that a few days have passed since last week's targeted killing of a senior Iranian general, it's becoming clear that President Trump didn't take this enormously provocative step as part of a carefully calibrated long-term strategy for dealing with Iran's hostile adventurism in the Middle East. Instead, it appears that he behaved as we worried he would from the start of his presidency -- by following his gut and allowing his reckless, belligerent, bullying style to be applied to something that truly matters.
Unfortunately, this time the stakes are really high.
Trump's target, Iranian Gen. Qassem Suleimani, was an unusual amalgam of military strategist and politician -- the puppet master who directed the Iranian proxies that killed hundreds of U.S. service members, yet who also provided key support for the United States' campaign against the Taliban government in Afghanistan. As the head of Iran's effort to expand its power across the Middle East, he was popular enough in his country to be seen as a future leader. But those efforts left him with a blood-drenched legacy in Syria, Lebanon and Yemen, among other countries.

There were plenty of reasons for U.S. officials (among others) to want to be rid of a man whom David Petraeus, the former commander of U.S. forces in Iraq, once described as "a truly evil figure." But Suleimani wasn't the leader of a stateless terrorist group; he was a top government official of a sovereign state. As one defense analyst observed, "This is the equivalent of Iran killing the U.S. chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff or the director of the Central Intelligence Agency and then taking credit for it." The potential consequences are therefore much bigger than those when U.S. forces killed Osama bin Laden and Abu Bakr Baghdadi.
It's worth bearing in mind that we reached this point after an intensifying exchange of tit-for-tat provocations and responses, starting with an attack by Iranian proxies on a U.S. military installation that killed a U.S. contractor. After Iranian-backed protesters briefly besieged the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, Trump's military advisors gave the president a list of options for how to respond. According to several news accounts, Trump surprised the group by taking the riskiest and most draconian option on the table, deliberately and dangerously escalating the conflict. One of Trump's concerns, aides told the New York Times, was that "no response would look weak after repeated threats by the United States."
In other words, Trump painted himself into a corner with his own bluster. And rather than letting his latest actions speak for themselves, he then pledged an even harsher response if Iran retaliates for Suleimani's death. If it does, he promised, the U.S will unleash a potentially "disproportionate" response as well as attacks on culturally important sites -- the kind of thing the United States condemned Islamic State forces for doing, and which many experts consider a violation of international law. So much for the moral beacon the president shines as the leader of the free world.
Although war or broad conflict between the U.S. and Iran may not be inevitable, Trump's only plan for avoiding further escalation seems to be browbeating the Iranians into capitulating. Good luck with that. Iran's first response after Suleimani's death was to pledge to resume its nuclear program in full, announcing that it would no longer abide by any of the limits the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action placed on its enrichment of fissile material. The announcement signals the apparent end of the deal, which European nations were struggling to keep intact despite Trump's withdrawal in 2018 and the increased sanctions the U.S. had applied against Iran.
The second response came from the Iranian-aligned leadership in Iraq. The Iraqi parliament adopted a resolution Sunday calling on the prime minister to expel remaining U.S. troops, who have fought alongside Iraqis against Islamic State forces. True to form, Trump responded by threatening to impose crippling sanctions on Iraq, a U.S. ally. Although there are good arguments for ending the decades-long U.S. deployment in Iraq, violating that country's sovereignty -- and getting kicked out unceremoniously -- is hardly the way to go about doing it.
And is there good reason to believe that Suleimani's death will curb the bloodshed he orchestrated? All we're seeing so far is the demise of a vital nuclear pact, significant damage to the U.S.-Iraqi relationship, the potential for violent retribution elsewhere in the world, a diversion of American resources from the fight against Islamic State militants, a unified anti-American response, the creation of a new martyr -- and no tangible reason to believe that the malign activities of Iran's proxies will stop just because Suleimani is dead.

BUSINESS BEAT; Boeing facing more issues, debt; Chicago company considers borrowing funds as it finds more potential problems with 737 Max planes.

Texto completo: Boeing Co. is weighing a move to raise more debt as the company faces new complications over the return of its 737 Max planes to service.
Although Boeing had about $20 billion in available funds at the end of the third quarter, costs stemming from the Max crisis are increasing, the Wall Street Journal reported Monday. That has prompted the company to consider raising additional debt, the paper said, citing unidentified people familiar with the matter.
Boeing is halting output of the Max, which has yet to gain approval to resume service after two fatal crashes prompted a global flight ban in March.

The production hiatus has reduced some costs, but it also means a longer wait for payments for finished planes. The Chicago company also faces compensation claims from airlines disrupted by the grounding, as well as from families of the crash victims.
The New York Times reported Sunday that Boeing was uncovering potential new problems with the plane that go beyond the software malfunctions that played a role in those crashes.
Meanwhile, American Airlines Group Inc. said it has reached a settlement with Boeing over the financial blow from the 737 Max grounding. The carrier said it would share about $30 million of the proceeds with employees.
The companies are still in talks over compensation for damages beyond 2019, American said. The Max's absence since March shaved at least $540 million from American's 2019 pretax income, the airline has said.
American is the second U.S. carrier after Southwest Airlines Co. to negotiate 2019 compensation with Boeing. American said it expects "substantially all" of the settlement to be in the form of reduced aircraft costs for grounded planes and future deliveries. Employees will receive their payment through the airline's profit-sharing program in March.
The Federal Aviation Administration recently asked Boeing to review all possible ramifications of the changes it is making on the plane. During that review, Boeing discovered that bundles of electrical wiring in the plane were too close together and -- at least in theory -- raised the potential for a short circuit that could cause pilots to lose control of the plane.
"We identified this wiring-bundle issue and we are working with the FAA to perform the appropriate analysis," Boeing spokesman Gordon Johndroe said Monday.
The company added that it is too soon to know whether it will need to make design changes, such as moving the wiring bundles farther apart. Boeing says it believes that other safeguards, including circuit breakers and insulation around the wiring, could be sufficient to prevent a short circuit from leading to another crash.
Boeing engineers have finished changes to a key software system called MCAS that was activated by faulty sensors in each crash, firmly pushing the noses of the planes down, a condition called runaway stabilizer.
Boeing has been working for more than a year to fix MCAS, which was designed partly to save the plane from aerodynamic stalls that could cause it to fall from the sky. Boeing is making the system less powerful and linking it to two sensors instead of one for extra protection against the kind of sensor failures that occurred before the crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia.
U.S. regulators are considering requiring pilots to complete simulator training before they can operate the Max again, the Journal reported Sunday. The story cited government and industry officials familiar with the matter.
The Federal Aviation Administration originally rejected the idea because it would cause extra costs and delays for airlines, the Journal said. But in recent weeks, officials said there has been increased interest among agency and industry safety experts in requiring such training.
Analysts expect Boeing to raise as much as $5 billion in additional debt to help cover spending that may exceed $15 billion in the first half of the year, the Journal said. Funds would help maintain Max production facilities and finished planes, as well as close the $4-billion purchase of an 80% stake in Embraer's airliner business.
Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg was ousted last month. Next week David Calhoun, a board member who took over as chairman in October, will become CEO.
Shares of Boeing have tumbled about 21% since the second of the two plane crashes, which killed 346 people. The stock rose 0.29% to $333.74 on Monday.

Texto completo: Readers are upset that the president's advisers did not stop him from taking an action that puts Americans in danger.
To the Editor:
Re "Trump's Choice of Killing Stunned Defense Officials" (front page, Jan. 5):
I was appalled to read that military aides included the option of killing Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani of Iran simply to make other options look more reasonable. That may work when the president is actually a mature adult, but not when he has the mind of, and acts like, a 12-year-old boy.
I hold the military and Pentagon responsible for all of the innocent lives that I fear will be lost as a direct result of this irresponsible action. What happens the next time when the aides put on the list the option of dropping a nuclear bomb on Tehran, with the hope that the president will choose a different option?
Our system of government works only if there are some actual, thinking adults in the room. It doesn't appear that our current system has a built-in mechanism for anyone to review, advise or consent before this president makes even worse choices in the days to come.

To the Editor:
You report that an American official describes the evidence supporting the Suleimani assassination as "thin." That assessment echoes what the head of British intelligence secretly told his government, nearly 20 years ago, about President George W. Bush's excuse for invading Iraq: "the case was thin" and "the intelligence and facts were being fixed around the policy" of going to war.
We can no more rely on Donald Trump to honestly report a threat than we could Mr. Bush. The issue is whether, this time, Congress will refuse to support a needless and calamitous war.
Karl Marx famously wrote that "history repeats itself; first as tragedy, second as farce." Sadly, he may be shown to be wrong: A second Republican president's Middle East war would prove an even graver tragedy than the first.
Mitchell Zimmerman
Palo Alto, Calif.
To the Editor:
Impetuous, impulsive, reckless. All accurately define Donald Trump and his leadership since he became president. Withdrawing the United States from the Iran nuclear deal, which by all appearances was achieving its intended objectives, was one of the earlier mind-boggling decisions coming from the Oval Office. The targeted killing of Qassim Suleimani was the latest.
Citing an imminent threat to American interests and people that required immediate action, Mr. Trump pulled a trigger. And while Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced that Americans are now 100 percent safer, it sure doesn't feel that way.
I suspect that most Americans are not imagining that this impulsive action is moving the United States and Iran closer to the negotiating table. Rather, Americans are bracing for yet another war in the Mideast with our name on it and wondering if it is safe to walk the streets of Times Square.

Murdering Qassim Suleimani can easily be justified. President Trump's mistake was publicly taking ownership of the action, a behavior that contrasts sharply with what Israel does. Israeli prime ministers, as a matter of policy, never publicize clandestine military operations.
Taking ownership of the operation jeopardizes the lives of countless Americans serving this country in embassies worldwide. Clearly and unfortunately, we have a president who publicly glorifies this action without considering any consequences to the welfare of fellow Americans.

To the Editor:
The blood of every American or innocent person who will be killed in retaliatory attacks by Iran, as a result of President Trump's order to assassinate Qassim Suleimani against advice of most who are charged with advising him on matters of war, is on Mr. Trump's hands. That the attack was politically motivated, without any imminent threat, is another example of why Mr. Trump should be removed from office. Our men and women in uniform are being sent to fight, to the death if necessary, and at home and abroad we can expect acts of terror to result in the death of civilians.

To the Editor:
While the killing of Qassim Suleimani was a highly provocative and dangerous act, Iran now has a chance to correct its path forward instead of seeking revenge, at great cost.
In the 1970s when the shah was in power, Iran moved too far to the right in favoring the wealthy, at the expense of the majority of its people, who were poor. With the turmoil of revolution, it moved too far in the other direction in the 1980s, when Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini was the supreme leader.
Having swung in such opposites, Iran, with a highly educated middle class, now needs to recognize that these extremes of its ruling government haven't worked, and it's time for the vast majority to take leadership in hand, and end the cycle of provocation that has lasted over 40 years.

Texto completo: The image, shared on Twitter by Representative Paul Gosar of Arizona, is photoshopped and has been circulating online for years.
False. As lawmakers in Washington and allies around the world grappled with President Trump's decision to launch a strike that killed Iran's most important general, an Arizona Republican, Representative Paul Gosar, shared a fake image from his personal Twitter account on Monday purporting to show President Barack Obama shaking hands with President Hassan Rouhani of Iran. The two men have never met in person.
What's more, Mr. Rouhani is still the president, contradicting Mr. Gosar's suggestion that he is no longer "in power." The Iranian flag in the background of the photoshopped image also appears to be incorrect, as it is missing the white Arabic script on its top green bar and a red emblem of a tulip in the central white bar.
The original photograph was taken in 2011 and showed Mr. Obama meeting with Manmohan Singh, then India's prime minister.
"No one said this wasn't photoshopped. No one said the president of Iran was dead. No one said Obama met with Rouhani in person," Mr. Gosar tweeted after an outcry over his post, arguing that his point was that "Obama coddled, appeased, nurtured and protected the worlds No. 1 sponsor of terror."
The fake image has been circulating online since at least 2013, surfacing on Middle Eastern blogs and conservative websites. In 2015, it featured in a TV ad that promoted a Republican senator for his opposition to the Iran nuclear deal.

Re "A Love So Persistent, They Had to Marry Twice" (Sunday Styles, Jan. 5):
Their story was so sweet, it brought tears to my eyes. I've been married for 53 years, and their drifting apart and reconnecting made perfect sense to me. After a long marriage, you can always find your way back because you have both grown up together.
The memories they shared represent their entire lives.

Texto completo: Officials were still investigating the attack, which was consistent with the work of low-level Iranian nationalist hackers looking for easy American targets, experts said.
A federal government website was hacked over the weekend to show messages vowing revenge for the death of Iran's most powerful commander and a doctored photograph of President Trump being punched in the jaw. The intrusion was consistent with the work of low-level nationalist Iranian hackers, experts said.
For an unspecified amount of time starting Saturday, the website of the Federal Depository Library Program featured the altered photograph superimposed over a map of the Middle East, accompanied by a tribute to Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, whose killing in an American drone strike on Friday prompted worldwide political upheaval.
"Hacked by Iran Cyber Security Group Hackers," text on the website read before it was put back online. "This is only small part of Iran's cyber ability!"
The program, administered by the United States Government Publishing Office, helps the public access government documents on a wide variety of subjects -- including bills, regulations and studies -- in more than 1,100 libraries around the country. Its website was taken down for 24 hours as officials conducted a security analysis and put back online Sunday after they found that "none of the site's data was compromised," Gary Somerset, a spokesman for the office, said in an email Monday.
It was not immediately clear if the attack had come from Iran or if the country had ordered it. Mr. Somerset said the office "continues to coordinate with the appropriate authorities to investigate the origins of the intrusion."
A spokeswoman for the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, which is under the Department of Homeland Security, said in a statement that there was no confirmation that hackers sponsored by Iran were behind the attack.
She said, without elaborating, that hackers were able to exploit a "misconfiguration" in the website's content management system that was subsequently fixed. She said that "in these times of increased threats," all organizations should increase safeguards against possible attacks.
The hack came as experts and officials have warned of possible cyberattacks in the wake of General Suleimani's killing.
The attack on the Federal Depository Library Program's site was "superficial" and seemed to reflect "nationalist, low-grade hacking activity," said John Hultquist, senior director of intelligence analysis at the cybersecurity company FireEye. He said it did not suggest the possibility of a larger, more serious attack.
"It kind of looks worse than it really is," he said.
In some cases, the Iranian government pays hackers to conduct such attacks, Mr. Hultquist said; in others, the hacks come from people conscripted by Iran for government service. But the government does not need to explicitly order such attacks at all.
"It's like a guard dog," he said. "You don't necessarily have to be there for it to do the job."
Mr. Hultquist said hackers regularly trawl government websites, looking for vulnerabilities.
"They're looking for anything with any remote connection with the U.S. government," he said. "They found this one."
The website pulled in a modest amount of traffic in 2019 -- 634,000 page views, according to Mr. Somerset. He said the website is used by library staff nationwide.
James A. Lewis, a former government official and cybersecurity expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said the program was probably the agency the hackers "found first that had weak security."
He said the hack was likely not conducted by Iran's more sophisticated team but instead recalled a "low-budget hack of the sort Iran's 'patriot hackers' are known for, including the cheesy imagery."
Bigger agencies have better defenses and are likely to be safe, Mr. Lewis said. But Iran could possibly find more vulnerabilities like the one exposed by the hackers of the program's website.
"Possibly another small agency -- there are dozens," he said. "It's really a political decision for Iran's leaders. Iran has the capability to do something dramatic, but at least for now, they want to avoid something so dramatic as to invite retaliation."

Days After Exiting Race, Castro Throws Support to Warren

Texto completo: The move came soon after Mr. Castro ended his own bid for the Democratic presidential nomination, and gives a lift to Ms. Warren's campaign as it tries to reignite excitement.
Julián Castro, the former housing secretary whose progressive presidential candidacy did not make significant inroads with Democratic voters but earned plaudits from the party's left wing, has endorsed Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, offering a possible lift for her candidacy less than one month before the Iowa caucuses.
Mr. Castro announced his endorsement on Monday morning, just days after he ended his own bid for the White House. In a statement, Mr. Castro cast Ms. Warren as the logical extension of his campaign's social-justice-driven message, which seeks to correct inequities through targeted policy proposals. He will campaign with Ms. Warren this week, joining her Tuesday night at a rally at Kings Theatre in Brooklyn.
"There's one candidate I see who is unafraid to fight like hell to make sure that America's promise will be there for everyone," Mr. Castro said in a video announcement released on Twitter. Ms. Warren, he said, "will make sure that no matter where you live in America -- or where your family came from in the world, you have a path to opportunity, too."
The endorsement is not a shock to close observers of the Democratic primary race -- Mr. Castro and Ms. Warren made no secret of their shared affection for each other -- but it formalizes a partnership that could help Ms. Warren reignite excitement at a critical moment.
Ms. Warren has fallen from her polling peak in early October, when she was hailed as the race's ascendant front-runner and the standard-bearer for the party's progressive wing. National polls now show Ms. Warren firmly in third, behind former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who has been aided by grass-roots progressive groups and by some high-profile endorsements of his own, including from popular House members like Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Ilhan Omar of Minnesota.
It is unclear whether Mr. Castro's name carries similar political weight. His presidential candidacy struggled to break through in a significant way, but he led the field on a number of progressive issues, including reparations, border decriminalization and housing inequality. He impressed liberal activist groups like the Working Families Party and the Center for Popular Democracy, even though they formally backed Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders.
Ms. Warren thanked Mr. Castro for his support on Monday, calling him "a powerful voice for bold, progressive change."
During the waning months of his campaign, Mr. Castro was a vocal critic of the primary calendar, pointing to how voters in Iowa and New Hampshire, who hold their nominating contests first, are overwhelmingly white. Ms. Warren has, at times, sidestepped that issue, saying once in South Carolina that she was just "a player in the game on this one."

Texto completo: Ashlee Latimer fostered a young online community through the musical's social media. Fans know her better as Mx. Thief.
The Twitter account for "The Lightning Thief: The Percy Jackson Musical" has more than 50,000 followers. Ashlee Latimer knows them better than most.
She knows their names and handles, their inside jokes, their favorite Percy fan theories. She knows which follower is a massive Taylor Swift fan, and she knows that a delegation of Norwegians loves the musical. When she posted a tweet with a pair of cryptic emojis, a wink to a lyric on the then-unannounced cast album, she knew exactly which sleuthing follower would reply within minutes and crack the code.
But the show's fans know next to nothing about Latimer.
They're plenty familiar, though, with her alter ego: Mx. Thief, the gender-neutral alias posting memes and motivational notes on the @LTMusical account since the show's run Off Broadway in 2017. Mx. Thief has become a carefully crafted and recognizable voice -- in some posts mysterious and teasing; in others, urging followers to spread kindness. Sometimes, Mx. Thief is straight sass, a camp counselor crossed with an older sibling, calling out trolls, or professional theater critics.
The result is a Twitter account that, beyond its purpose as a marketing tool, doubles as a digital gathering place for fans of Percy Jackson, the demigod protagonist of the musical and Rick Riordan's best-selling children's series. Few other Broadway shows have matched this balance -- or number of followers -- on their social media accounts.
And now that the Broadway run is over -- "The Lightning Thief" had its final performance on Sunday -- Latimer, 28, is coming out from behind the curtain for the first time.
Mx. Thief became a fan favorite, not unlike the characters onstage at the Longacre Theater, receiving gifts and art works from followers -- including an illustration of an anonymous figure with a thick, old-school computer monitor for a head and a collage sent from Australia of the artist's favorite Mx. Thief tweets, printed and mounted on blue cardstock.
"Getting messages and tweets and comments about the ways that the show has changed their life, and also how the social has impacted them, has been so special," Latimer said.
But for three years her identity remained anonymous. This isn't unusual; most brand accounts have no reason to disclose the social media manager pulling the strings. But when followers began to ask questions -- Who exactly was running the account? Was it a member of the cast? A character from the Percy Jackson books? -- it was decided that Latimer should maintain the mystique.
While the musical was met with harsh reviews and low weekly grosses, its social media presence helped to bring in first-time theatergoers, said Carl White, one of its producers.
"Hamilton" and "Dear Evan Hansen" have far larger Twitter followings, but "Lightning Thief" was on par with the long-running "Phantom of the Opera" and "Waitress," which also closed on Sunday.
And producers encouraged Latimer to push certain envelopes: After opening-night reviews were less than stellar -- Jesse Green in The New York Times called the show "a failed attempt to board the teenage fantasy-angst train" -- the account responded.
"I don't think there's anything wrong with clapping back at one's critics," said White, who praised the account for prompting "tremendous" engagement. "We know that a consumer is more likely to listen to the recommendation from a friend than they are necessarily a critic."
For many fans, that's what Latimer became. Followers last year gave her the name Mr. Thief, before she requested a correction that caught on: Mx. Thief would be a better choice, to avoid making an assumption about her identity. (Latimer is gender-fluid and uses she/her pronouns.)
In 2017, Latimer was working at the Pekoe Group, a theater marketing agency, and was assigned to take on "The Lightning Thief" and its social media. After the Off Broadway run wrapped up, the musical's producers hired her directly to stay on through last year's national tour and the transfer to Broadway.
Since August 2019, she has also been an associate at TBD Theatricals, where she juggles a full-time creative development gig with her "Lightning Thief" responsibilities.
There's another pretty big Mx. Thief detail that followers don't know about: She has a Tony Award. Latimer was a producer on "Once on This Island," which won the best musical revival prize in 2018. (A video of her weeping on live television during the acceptance became a bit of a meme.)
Latimer is not much older than the primarily Generation Z fan base for "The Lightning Thief," but there are enough years between her and her audience to have had what she calls "'Freaky Friday' crypt keeper" moments -- using acronyms and slang from her teenage years that no longer translate.
She grew up in the era of Myspace and still has traumatic memories of the fear that came with accidentally overusing pay-per-minute internet on her cellphone. "I feel like the kids are going to hear this and be like, wow, she is ancient," she said.
Her closest tie to online fandom was through now-defunct Harry Potter message boards, where she could post dissertations on "Half-Blood Prince" fan theories. Fast-forward a decade, and she's the one helping "Lightning Thief" followers meet kindred spirits in other time zones.
Fans shouldn't mourn Mx. Thief just yet. The show will have another national tour, though Latimer won't be behind the account anymore. "There will be a new Mx. Thief," she promised, "whoever they end up being."
In the meantime, it was Latimer as Mx. Thief who said goodbye after the production's last Broadway performance, quoting a lyric from the closing number: "we love you, demigods. thank you for an incredible quest."

Texto completo: He reimagined Wagner for the modern world, including a "Ring" focused on ecological destruction.
Harry Kupfer, a German opera director whose inventive and often provocative stagings of Wagner masterpieces put him in the vanguard of a generation that sought to reinterpret the canon, died on Dec. 30 in Berlin. He was 84.
His death was announced by his agency, Arsis Artist Management. The agency did not specify the cause but said he had been ill for some time.
Mr. Kupfer, whose career began in East Germany, rose to international fame in 1978 with an innovative production of Wagner's "Der Fliegende Holländer" at the Bayreuth Festival that reframed the story as the fantasy of its heroine. He became the director of the Komische Oper in East Berlin three years later and held that post for 21 years, through the reunification of Germany.
He developed a strong partnership with the conductor Daniel Barenboim, collaborating with him on a post-apocalyptic "Ring" at Bayreuth and later on Wagner's 10 mature operas at the Berlin Staatsoper. Mr. Kupfer's extensive work at two of Berlin's three major opera houses led the German press to call him the "opera king of Berlin."
Over a six-decade career, Mr. Kupfer directed more than 200 opera productions, going from enfant terrible to elder statesman. He outraged some purists with concept-driven productions that employed unusual settings, but he also won hordes of admirers and influenced generations of directors. Early stagings of his that once shocked -- as when he set Richard Strauss's "Elektra" in an abattoir in the 1970s -- would hardly raise an eyebrow now.
Mr. Barenboim said that he found Mr. Kupfer's rehearsals so revelatory that he began attending some that conductors would normally skip.
"He always saw that there was a permanent connection between the stage and the pit," Mr. Barenboim said in an interview. "Sometimes working together as one, sometimes in counterpoint."
Mr. Kupfer's close attention to the score -- "I only have ideas with music," he said in 2002 -- was evident in his breakout "Holländer" at Bayreuth. He placed the opera's heroine, Senta, onstage from the very beginning, and had the opera toggle back and forth between her dream world and external reality, which was suggested at times by the house of her father, Daland.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
"The subtlest advantage of Mr. Kupfer's concept, especially striking beside the work of directors who willfully or ignorantly divorce dramaturgy from music, is its capacity to 'explain' stylistic disparities in the score," Joseph Horowitz wrote in The New York Times. "The riper, more chromatic stretches are associated with the vigorously depicted fantasy world of Senta's mind; the squarer, more traditional parts are framed by the dull walls of Daland's house, which collapse outward whenever Senta loses touch with reality."
The opening-night audience was divided: The Associated Press reported "cheering and booing for 20 minutes after the curtain had dropped."
Such divisions would be common over the course of Mr. Kupfer's career.
After he returned to Bayreuth in 1988 with a production of Wagner's "Ring" set after a nuclear catastrophe, the critic Barry Millington wrote that Mr. Kupfer had highlighted the work's message "that the abandonment of love and humanity's finer sensibilities in favor of territorial aggrandizement and enhanced material possessions leads to the despoliation of nature and ultimately global extinction."
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
But the staging was panned as "bizarre" by Martin Bernheimer in The Los Angeles Times. He complained that Mr. Kupfer "meddles" and "invents action unsanctioned by the libretto and, more dangerous, brings characters on even when Wagner wanted them offstage."
Mr. Barenboim said he thought that Mr. Kupfer's productions ultimately worked, despite their bold interventions, because "he had a great preoccupation that the story really be told."
"Familiarity does not always breed contempt," Mr. Barenboim added. "The more familiar the public became with his stagings, the more they liked it. But he was always controversial -- and he enjoyed it."
Harry Kupfer was born in Berlin on Aug. 12, 1935, and fell in love with opera as a boy, often going several times a week.
"When I was 15, it was clear I wanted to work in an opera house," he told the Australian newspaper The Age in 2002. "As what, I didn't know. I had no voice, so I couldn't be a singer. So I studied theater, science, music and came to the opera that way."
He studied at the Theaterschule Hans Otto in Leipzig and embarked on a career in small theaters in East Germany. He began as an assistant director in Halle, where he made his directorial debut in 1958 with a production of Dvorak's "Rusalka."
He went on to work his way up through theaters in Stralsund; Chemnitz, which was then called Karl-Marx-Stadt; Weimar; and Dresden, before being named to lead the Komische Oper in 1981. His tenure lasted until 2002.
Mr. Kupfer came of age among a generation of post-World War II German directors who embraced Regietheater ("director's theater"), an approach that jettisoned old production traditions and devised new stagings that often changed the settings of classic works and reimagined some of their plots, with an eye toward contemporary social and political resonances.
A key influence was Walter Felsenstein, the Austrian director who founded the Komische Oper in 1947 and whose ideas of "realistic musical theater," including a true-to-life approach to psychology and social milieu, inspired a generation of German directors including Mr. Kupfer, Ruth Berghaus, Götz Friedrich and Joachim Herz.
Mr. Kupfer's work, in turn, inspired a new generation. Barrie Kosky, the current artistic director of the Komische Oper, said in an interview that no director had influenced him in his youth as much as Mr. Kupfer, whose productions Mr. Kosky first saw in the 1980s as a visiting student.
"For a young, naïve, innocent guy from Australia to be confronted with the virtuosity of what Harry delivered from the stage was sort of gobsmacking," he said.
Mr. Kupfer's work stood out, Mr. Kosky added, for the musical underpinnings of his ideas; the demands he put on singers to act and use their whole bodies as well as their voices; the emotional core that informed his storytelling; and the way he would direct his choruses.
"I had never seen a chorus move like that, or a director create such images with just 80 bodies," Mr. Kosky said.
Mr. Kupfer's productions often had strong political overtones. "He did it to make it universal," Mr. Kosky said. "It was never dogmatic. You never felt you were being lectured to."
Mr. Kupfer directed several world premieres, including Krzysztof Penderecki's "Die Schwarze Maske," for which he co-wrote the libretto, in 1986, and Aribert Reimann's "The House of Bernarda Alba," based on the Lorca play, in 2000.
His wife, Marianne Fischer-Kupfer, a singer and voice teacher, died in 2008. His survivors include their daughter, Kristiane Kupfer, an actress.
Mr. Kupfer's career came full circle last year. He returned to direct at the Komische Oper in March for the first time since 2002, and chose an obscure work that he remembered fondly from his youth: Handel's "Poro," which he had learned at his first job, in Halle. It was a joyous homecoming.
"He remembered the names of the people in the box office, in makeup, and the dressers," Mr. Kosky recalled. "It was a very touching and moving and extraordinary thing."

Texto completo: The once impeachment-wary leader whom many in the Democratic Party considered a liability has transformed into a powerful symbol of the caucus.
"Women really are powering the Democratic Party."
-- Lisa Lerer, The New York Times politics reporter.

It was hard to miss: On Thursday, in front of a row of American flags, and sporting a crisp white suit, Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced that the House will draft articles of impeachment against President Trump next week, setting the stage for a vote before Christmas.
Hours later, just as she was ending a session with the press, a reporter asked her if she decided to move ahead with the impeachment process (her second as a member of Congress, she was also a legislator when President Clinton was impeached) because she hated the president.
She was not pleased.
She wagged her finger at the reporter and stormed back to the podium. Then, staring straight at the camera, she delivered a dramatic retort.
"This is about the Constitution of the United States and the facts that lead to the president's violation of his oath of office," she said sharply. "As a Catholic, I resent your using the word 'hate' in a sentence that addresses me. I don't hate anyone."
"So don't mess with me," she added, before gliding out of the room, metaphorical and literal white suit intact.
And just like that, the one-time impeachment-wary leader who was once seen as a liability for many in her own party cemented her position as an impeachment warrior who managed to rally her party behind her and steer the process through the House with a measured hand.
At the apex of this historic moment, I caught up with Lisa Lerer, a New York Times politics reporter who has been zipping across the United States on various campaign trails. We spoke about Pelosi's transformation into the Democratic Party's heroic icon and her meticulous leadership style.
Lisa, in January you wrote that Pelosi "might just be the most powerful politician in the country." And that was before the whole impeachment process. Do you think that's still the case?
I think that still holds true, and maybe it's more evident now. It is striking how much she's been able to hold her caucus together. There was a big push from a lot of Democrats in the House for impeachment during the Mueller report and she was the one putting the brakes on that. Contrast that with Republicans when they took power in 2010 -- that was a really contentious period for the caucus and [then house speaker] John Boehner had a lot of trouble keeping them together because of the burgeoning Tea Party movement.
Right. Initially there were also Democrats who said they wouldn't vote for Pelosi to become Speaker of the House. How do you think she managed to transform into the popular face of the party?
She's the ultimate insider, right? She's been in Congress a long time. She's an expert on how the rules work and how things actually get done. She's known for twisting arms when she needs them. She rewards the people who have been loyal, and she has taken action against those who have voted against her.
But not only is Pelosi really powerful politically, she's also become this powerful symbol for the party. We are in this moment of intense female energy and that's the message that the party has really been leaning into.
And it's not just who's running and winning races -- it's the infrastructure of who is getting those women to victory. Out on the campaign trail, the number of women who were relatively uninvolved in politics and are now political activists is striking. Women really are powering the Democratic party.
And Pelosi totally understands the power of that image, too, right?
That jacket!
Exactly -- she dresses for the occasion and wields those striking moments to her advantage.
Right. I think she's also a kind of foil that Democrats really want to see up against Trump because there was such a strong gender component to his victory -- not only because he was running against the first female party nominee but also because of the things he's said about women in the past. So I think there's an appeal to have this strong female adversary against him.
All the profiles I've read of Pelosi describe her as meticulous and careful. Do you think she has to be because she's a woman and is held to more stringent standards?
That's probably true -- some of it might be personality -- but I do think there's a different standard, particularly when she was coming up back in the 80s, that standard was even more intense. She is this different model of female political leadership than what we see now. She's of the model where you ran for office once your kids were grown -- that was really how it was done. That's what happened to Hillary Clinton and a lot of women leaders from that time. Compare that to what we saw in 2018 -- this new crop of women, many of whom were younger, maybe single or had young children at home.
You're currently traveling around the U.S. speaking to voters on both sides. Lisa, what image does Pelosi project to Republican voters?
It's important to remember that she was the face of almost every Republican attack ad and I think there's definitely a gender piece to that: She was the San Francisco liberal and that's how the Republicans would go after her. But Chuck Schumer's a New York City liberal and they didn't really go after him in the same way.
Readers, how would you grade Nancy Pelosi's performance and leadership style? A, B, C, D or F? Tell us why .

Texto completo: The final season of "Schitt's Creek" debuts on Pop TV, and a special "Jeopardy!" tournament begins on ABC.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
What's on TV
SCHITT'S CREEK 9 p.m. on Pop. It's the beginning of the end for this light Canadian sitcom. The Rose family has (mostly) grown accustomed to Schitt's Creek, a rural town they bought as a joke gift and then moved to after losing their fortune. In the Season 5 finale -- beware, spoilers ahead -- Patrick (Noah Reid) and David (Dan Levy) got engaged, Moira (Catherine O'Hara) celebrated the premiere of her "Cabaret" production, and Stevie (Emily Hampshire) had a what-am-I-doing-with-my-life moment. The sixth and final season opens with David on the hunt for a wedding venue and Johnny (Eugene Levy) and Moira enjoying a romantic picnic. The show received Emmy recognition for the first time last year, earning four nominations. In an interview with The New York Times, Eugene Levy, who created the series with his son, Dan, said he thought Season 6 would be the strongest yet and that "the series is ending in a way that wraps this up with a lovely bow."
JEOPARDY!: THE GREATEST OF ALL TIME 8 p.m. on ABC. This is the moment "Jeopardy!" fanatics have been waiting for. The show's three record-breaking contestants -- Ken Jennings, Brad Rutter and James Holzhauer -- will compete in a series of one-hour shows airing over several nights. The first to win three matches walks away with $ 1 million and the title "greatest of all time." The runners-up will each receive $ 250,000. Holzhauer captivated viewers last year by setting the record for the most money won during one game ( $ 110,914), and then surpassing it three more times. He became a minor celebrity, and the special tournament allows the show to ride the wave of the popularity of all three contestants.
ZOEY'S EXTRAORDINARY PLAYLIST 10 p.m. on NBC. Fans of "Glee" or "Crazy Ex-Girlfriend" may want to tune into this whimsical new dramedy. While the protagonist, Zoey (Jane Levy), a young coder in San Francisco, is in the middle of getting an MRI, an earthquake causes the machine to malfunction. Soon, Zoey starts to hear the thoughts and secrets of those around her in the form of pop songs. The catch? Only she can see and hear the musical numbers. In this pilot episode, Zoey tries to determine whether her new ability is a blessing or a curse. She gets something of an answer when her father (Peter Gallagher), who has a rare neurological disease that has left him immobile and unable to communicate, comes alive through the music.
What's Streaming
SILENT WITNESS Stream on BritBox. This dark British procedural returns for a 23rd season. Emilia Fox stars as Nikki Alexander, the head of a team of forensic pathologists who solve grisly crimes. In the first case of the season, a private jet crashes outside of London, with a former American ambassador among the passengers. At the same time, Thomas (Richard Lintern) looks into a businessman's apparent suicide that has ties to the crash.

Texto completo: The former auto magnate boarded a bullet train for the first leg of his escape to Lebanon, which officials in Tokyo are still investigating.
A team of operatives working to help Carlos Ghosn escape from Japan spent hundreds of thousands of dollars scoping out airports and other entry points in Indonesia, the Philippines, South Korea, Taiwan and Thailand before his flight last week, a person with knowledge of the matter said.
The goal was to find security flaws that would allow Mr. Ghosn to evade the authorities, this person said. Ultimately, the planning team flew him from Japan to Turkey and then on to Lebanon. Mr. Ghosn has a home in Beirut and faces no extradition to Japan; he is also a citizen of France, where he has spent most of his adult life.
The preparation for his escape, remarkable in its scope, was conducted under a veil of secrecy: Even some of the project's operatives did not know the client's identity or when the escape would take place, said the person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the legal sensitivity of the issue.
Mr. Ghosn, the former head of the Nissan-Renault-Mitsubishi alliance, is facing charges of financial misconduct in Japan and was free on bail. He left his home in central Tokyo on Dec. 29, in an escape that the authorities are piecing together, fleeing what he called a "rigged Japanese justice system."
Details of his trip are beginning to come to light. That afternoon, Mr. Ghosn walked about 900 yards to a hotel, where he met two men, according to NHK and Nikkei, which cited sources in the city prosecutor's office and the Tokyo police.
The three then went to the Shinagawa railroad station, a major hub, and a little after 4:30 p.m. boarded a Shinkansen, or high-speed bullet train, for Osaka, about 340 miles southwest of the capital, the reports said.
It's unclear if Mr. Ghosn, who is one of the most recognizable public figures in Japan, hid his appearance. Once in Osaka, the three men entered a hotel near Kansai International Airport about 8 p.m. A couple of hours later, the two men left the hotel with two large boxes; Mr. Ghosn was not in sight, the reports said. They boarded a corporate jet with the boxes, and flew to Istanbul.
News reports have said that Mr. Ghosn evaded airport security measures by hiding in a box that was loaded on the plane.
From Istanbul, Mr. Ghosn reportedly got on a smaller plane, and arrived in Beirut later Monday.
Lebanese officials have said he entered legally with a French passport and a Lebanese ID, so there was no reason to stop him at the border. But on Monday, France's foreign minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, suggested that might not have been the case.
"As far as we know, he did not use French documents," he told BFM TV.
The French finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, appeared to harden the government's stance on Mr. Ghosn, saying on Monday that the executive should face justice in a court of law.
"When one is a defendant, one does not escape justice," he told France Inter radio. "And Carlos Ghosn is a defendant like any other."
Mr. Le Maire added that the French government was ready to open an investigation into $ 11 million in questionable expenses at the headquarters of the alliance between Renault, Nissan and Mitsubishi Motors while Mr. Ghosn headed the group. The expenses were identified in June during an internal audit carried out by Nissan and Renault, an alliance in which the French government holds a 15 percent stake.
Mr. Ghosn has long denied the allegations of financial wrongdoing and insisted he had been set up by Nissan executives who were worried that he would further merge the operations of the Japanese automaker and Renault of France.
Mr. Ghosn's escape was an embarrassment for the Japanese authorities, who on Monday promised to tighten airport baggage inspections and the rules governing the release of criminal suspects on bail.
"Now, measures have been taken so that similar acts can't be committed," Masako Mori, Japan's justice minister, said at a news conference. Though her ministry is not responsible for baggage inspection, she said, different agencies are working to tighten control.
Ms. Mori also said the government would accelerate an existing review of Japan's bail policies, including whether to require defendants to wear tracking wrist or ankle bracelets. Mr. Ghosn offered to wear one when he sought bail, but the court granted it without that requirement.
She added that Mr. Ghosn's bail had been canceled. In leaving Japan, he forfeited 1.5 billion yen in bail, or about $ 13.9 million.
Mr. Ghosn is expected to meet with reporters this week. On Monday, a host on the Fox Business Network, Maria Bartiromo, said that she had spoken to Mr. Ghosn over the weekend and that he said he would present evidence that the criminal counts against him were an effort by Nissan and Japanese officials to prevent a merger with Renault -- a charge he has made before.
Ms. Mori defended the country's justice system as fair and open, with plenty of opportunities for Mr. Ghosn to defend himself.
"We acknowledge that there are various criticisms of Japan's criminal justice procedures, but every country has a different criminal justice system," she said. "It isn't appropriate to simply focus on one part of the system when comparing it to other countries."
Mr. Ghosn was accompanied out of Japan by Michael Taylor, an American security consultant and a former Green Beret, The New York Times reported on Friday, citing a person familiar with the matter.
Mr. Taylor, a well-known private-security contractor, has extensive contacts in Lebanon dating to the 1980s, when he was deployed to Beirut as part of a team of United States Special Forces that worked alongside Lebanese soldiers. He speaks Arabic, and Lebanese intermediaries connected him with Mr. Ghosn, according to a person familiar with the matter.
The Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday, citing an anonymous source, that Mr. Ghosn had been smuggled through the Kansai airport in a type of box often used for concert equipment. It said that the terminal for private jets at that airport was essentially empty, and that oversize luggage could not fit in the airport's scanners.
A customs official at the airport, Akira Taniguchi, said that screening of luggage was done in two stages. In the first, a private security company using X-ray and other equipment checks whether there are items that are not allowed on board, like guns or knives.
In the second stage, customs officials check whether the bags contain items that are not permitted to be brought into or taken out of Japan, like drugs and some foods. They use X-ray machines, metal detectors, drug detectors and dogs for that step.
Asked if Mr. Ghosn had managed to elude these measures, Mr. Taniguchi said, "We cannot comment on this."

Texto completo: They come in the night: Drones - lots of them - flying in precise formations over the Colorado and Nebraska prairie.
Whose are they? Unknown.
Why are they there? Unclear.
"It's creepy," said Missy Blackman, who saw three drones hovering over her farm outside Palisade, Nebraska, on a recent evening, including one that lingered right above her house. "I have a lot of questions of why and what are they, and nobody seems to have any answers."
Since before Christmas, sheriff's departments in the region have been bombarded with reports of large drones with blinking lights and wingspans of up to 6 feet flying over rural towns and open fields. The drones have unnerved residents, prompted a federal investigation and made international news, even though they may be perfectly legal.
And still, they remain unexplained.
"In terms of aircraft flying at night and not being identified, this is a first for me personally," said Sheriff James Brueggeman of Perkins County, Nebraska, who has worked in law enforcement for about 28 years and who saw the drones while on patrol one night.
He said he had heard rumblings about people wanting to shoot down a drone, and had urged residents to report the sightings to law enforcement instead. "I think it's kind of a joke, but you have to remember the part of the country we live in," the sheriff said. "People here don't like their privacy to be invaded."
The flights have drawn attention just as the Federal Aviation Administration recently proposed sweeping new regulations that would require most drones to be identifiable. Ian Gregor, a spokesman for the FAA, said that the timing of the proposed rule was coincidental, but that the agency had opened an investigation of the sightings in Colorado and Nebraska.
"Multiple FAA divisions and government agencies are investigating these reports," Gregor said in an email. He declined to discuss the inquiry in detail.
On Facebook, 911 dispatch lines and local newspaper columns, the drones have been the talk of rural Colorado and Nebraska. And as sightings increase - people in four counties said they had seen them on Dec. 31 - so too does the urgency of residents' questions.
Some have suggested they might be part of a simple mapping operation, or a land survey conducted by an oil and gas company - but why would such flights run at night?
Sen. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., said on social media that he would "closely monitor the situation." A newspaper headline in Akron, Colorado, asked, "What's with the drones?" Multiple law enforcement agencies warned residents that shooting a drone out of the sky would be a crime.
"They're high enough where you couldn't shoot one anyway, but they're low enough that they're a nuisance," said Dawn George, who lives near Wray, Colorado, who said her border collie has barked at the drones when they fly over her property.
George said she had heard wild speculation about who might be responsible for the flights - the government? a cartel? a gas company? - and feared they would never know the truth.
"All the sudden, it's just going to stop and we're not going to have answers," George said. "And that's very unsettling to a lot of people. It's the fear of the unknown."
Unmanned drones, which have exploded into popular usage in recent years and can be used for everything from mapping to photography to farming, can be difficult to track. Operators of all but the smallest drones have been required to register with the federal government since 2015, but there is no straightforward, legal way for state and local officials to identify the owner of a particular drone or to track that drone's location.
"Like in many other areas of drone regulation, the statutory and regulatory framework is lagging the technology," said Reggie Govan, a former chief counsel to the FAA who now teaches at the University of Pennsylvania Law School.
Govan said federal officials have tracking tools to figure out where the Colorado and Nebraska drones were coming from, but that the vast area over which the drones were operating could make that task difficult.
Limitations in drone detection have allowed rogue drone operators to approach the White House without raising alarms and, in another extreme case, to deploy homemade bombs in a Pennsylvania neighborhood. Though it was not clear that the drones flying over Colorado and Nebraska were violating the law, residents and local officials said they would welcome the proposed new FAA rule that would make it easier to identify drones.
"Most people are very reasonable, and they say it could be somebody mapping or doing topography," said Michael Yowell, a sheriff's captain in Lincoln County, Colorado, whose house was buzzed over by a drone squadron on New Year's Eve. "But you can't rule out what you don't know."
The drone sightings started in northeast Colorado around mid-December and have only grown more widespread since then. Almost all the sightings have occurred between sunset and about 10 p.m., though Blackman said she had seen them out later one night in Nebraska. She said she had looked at them through binoculars and did not see any markings, just plain silver and white coloring.
Across the state line in Colorado, Yowell tried to photograph the drones with the camera he uses to document crime scenes, but came away without a clear image. He estimated that up to 30 drones were flying each night, though not all in the same place.
He said local officials were studying the flight path of the drones and coordinating across county lines to figure out where they were coming from. If his analysis was correct, he said, the drones would be back out on Wednesday night, flying in a grid pattern in the rural area between Hugo and Karval, Colorado, about 100 miles southeast of Denver.
"We want to know, at around 10 o'clock, when we start to lose visuals of these, which direction are they homing? Which way are they heading?" Yowell said. "We hope that's how we can contact somebody on the ground."
Sheriff Todd Combs of Yuma County, Colorado, said in a Facebook post that the drones appeared to be staying at least 150 feet from buildings or people, based on the footage he has seen.
"There are many theories about what is going on, but at this point, that's all they are," he said. "I think we are all feeling a little bit vulnerable due to the intrusion of our privacy that we enjoy in our rural community, but I don't have a solution."

A human's touch still needed Japan finds that robots have limitations for certain kinds of work

Texto completo: ASAHIKAWA, Japan - Removing the tiny eyes that pockmark potatoes is dull, repetitive and time-consuming work - perfect, it would seem, for robots in a country where the population is declining and workers are increasingly in short supply.
But it's not so simple.
When a food processing plant that makes potato salad and stews in Hokkaido, Japan's northernmost island, tried out a robot prototype designed to remove the potatoes' eyes, the machine was not up to the task.
The robot's camera sensors were not sensitive enough to identify every eye. While human hands can roll a potato in every direction, the robot could rotate the vegetables on only one axis and so failed to dig out many of the blemishes that are toxic to humans. Other perfectly good pieces were carved away.
"Fundamentally, it could not do the work to the standard of humans," said Akihito Shibayama, a factory manager at Yamazaki Group, which operates the plant in Asahikawa, a midsize city in Hokkaido where 30 workers process about 15 tons of potatoes a day.
Japan, the world's third-largest economy, hopes that robots and other types of automation will help solve its demographic problems and impending labor shortage.
But businesses are struggling as some jobs that seem ripe for a robotic takeover prove remarkably difficult to outsource to a machine.
Robots can "perform simple tasks but not tasks that require judgment or the ability to evaluate a change in a situation," said Toshiya Okuma, associate director of global strategy in the robot business division of Kawasaki Heavy Industries, a leading Japanese developer of robotics that has long helped automate car factory assembly lines.
Still, however hospitable Japanese businesses have been to robots, they have learned that robots able to perform somewhat sophisticated tasks cost much more than human workers.
At the factory in Asahikawa, where about 60% of the work is automated, many tasks still require the human touch. Workers peel pumpkins, for example, because some skin enhances the flavor of stew. A robot can't determine just how much skin to shuck off.
Helping drive the interest in robots are concerns about the declining population in Japan, where births are at their lowest level since 1874. Already industries, including manufacturing, are starting to run low of workers.
In Japan, "instead of displacing workers, you are simply replacing workers," said Todd Sneider, deputy division chief for the Japan division of the International Monetary Fund.
Although a bill was passed last year to grant new visas to foreign workers to help cope with shortages, the government has consistently emphasized robots as more likely saviors.
"So where you would potentially have immigrants doing the jobs, you say, 'Go make robots,' " said Selma Sabanovic, a professor of cognitive science at Indiana University who was a visiting scholar at the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology in Tsukuba, Japan.
Business leaders have expressed doubts that foreigners could quickly solve Japan's need for workers.
"Japan has kind of a very pure-blood race," said Noritsugu Uemura, an executive in charge of government and external relations for Mitsubishi Electric, a leading electronics manufacturer. "I think not only could it take 20 or 30 years, but it will take more like 40 or 50 years to integrate immigrants into Japan."

Pompeo rebuffs Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell's pleas to run for Kansas Senate seat

Resumen: The secretary of State had been toying with a Senate bid for months. His decision to forgo a political run comes amid increased tensions with Iran.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell that he would not run for an open Senate seat in Kansas, despite McConnell's repeated entreaties, according to a source close to the GOP leader.
McConnell spoke with Pompeo Monday, "where he indicated he will not be running for Senate," confirmed the source, who was not authorized to talk publicly about the conversation. "Leader McConnell believes Secretary Pompeo is doing an incredible job as Secretary of State and is exactly where the country needs him to be right now. "
The New York Times and Washington Post first reported the news.
Pompeo had been toying with a Senate bid for months, courting GOP donors and highlighting his longstanding ties to Kansas.
President Donald Trump even seemed to confirm the possibility in November, when he told "Fox & Friends" that Pompeo – a former House member – might consider a return to electoral politics if he feels another Republican cannot win the open Senate seat in Kansas in 2020.
"If he thought there was a chance of losing that seat, I think he would do that," Trump said. "Mike would win easily in Kansas. Great state. And it's a Trump state. He'd win easily. "
It's not clear why Pompeo ruled out a bid now but his decision comes just days after the U. S. killed a top Iranian military leader, Gen. Qasem Soleimani, the leader of Iran's elite Quds Force. The killing has exacerbated U. S. tensions with Iran, whose leaders have threatened to retaliate, and stoked fears of another Middle East war.
Pompeo has spent hours since last week's airstrike trying to rally and reassure rattled U. S. allies, and he spent Sunday appearing on all five network news shows justifying Trump's surprise decision.
More: What you need to know about the escalating situation with Iran
McConnell had been pressing Pompeo to run for the seat now held by GOP Sen. Pat Roberts, who is retiring.
Pompeo took the helm of the State Department in April of 2018, and he has been one of Trump's staunchest defenders amid a series of foreign policy crises – from Afghanistan to North Korea to Syria.
On Ukraine, Pompeo has come under intense fire amid allegations that he knew about — and approved of — the efforts to pressure Ukraine's president to investigate Joe Biden and his son, as well as a debunked theory that Ukraine, not Russia, interfered in the 2016 presidential election.

Texto completo: Gabrielle Canon here, filling in for Arlene Martinez to kick off the first week back on the grind.
We've got a lot of new laws coming into effect in California, a new West Coast indictment for producer and alleged rapist Harvey Weinstein, and the story of an Oxnard man willing to use his leaf blower to do some good for his community.
But first, today is the 33rd anniversary of the first time scientists detected starlight from the birth of a galaxy — which was created 12 billion years earlier. The discovery, which refuted the largely held idea that all galaxies were created at the same time, happened right here in California.
″It’s probably the first forming galaxy we’ve seen, and if that’s right, galaxy formation is a much more extended process than heretofore imagined,″ Stanislav Djorgovski of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics told the Associated Press back in 1987. ″That’s something very new and changes our conception of how galaxies form,″ Djorgovski added.
Speaking of galaxies — one from a long time ago far far away — the film "Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker" has officially been deemed a member of the $100 Million Losers Club.
Harvey Weinstein indicted in Los Angeles
The movie mogul whose alleged sexual misconduct sparked the beginnings of the "Me Too" movement concluded his sex crimes trial in New York — and was immediately met with new indictments on the other coast, USA Today reports.
Weinstein has been charged with felony counts of forcible rape, forcible oral copulation, sexual penetration by use of force, and sexual battery by restraint, Los Angeles County District Attorney Jackie Lacey announced today.
“We believe the evidence will show that the defendant used his power and influence to gain access to his victims and then commit violent crimes against them,” Lacey said in a statement, adding that she commended the victims who spoke out and "bravely recounted what happened to them. It is my hope that all victims of sexual violence find strength and healing as they move forward. ”
Hundreds of new California laws now in effect
Gov. Gavin Newsom signed more than 1,200 bills into law last year (!!) and while not all of them were rolled out on Jan. 1, Californians — and others across the country — can expect to experience hundreds of big changes. From a landmark labor law directed to reign in employment misclassification in the gig economy (but sparking alarm in a vast array of industries) to the first major move toward privacy protection, the Ventura County Star's Megan Diskin has you covered, highlighting the most important changes that could impact your day-to-day.
For a comprehensive look at all the new laws, also check out this great L. A. Times interactive here.
Ventura asks: Would you pay a climate change tax?
Across California, the effects of climate change are already being felt. From wild weather to worsening wildfires, officials are grappling with how to mitigate the risks — and how to pay for the damage.
Now, Ventura County Supervisors are asking voters if they'd be willing to help pick up the tab. In the coming weeks, a poll will be conducted in the county to gauge support for an uptick in the sales tax. The Ventura County Board of Supervisors voted 3-2 last month to allocate up to $100,000 to a polling firm that will find out how popular a potential new ballot measure on the issue would be.
What else we are reading today
A more detailed look at the. . . um. . . penis fish that captured the nation's attention after a whooole lot of them turned up on a Northern California beach last month.
For years, Congress has neglected to finance the upkeep of cherished public lands — and America deserves better. Or so Pacific Crest Trail Association executive director and columnist Liz Bergeron says in this CALMatters commentary.
Los Angeles is home to the largest Iranian-American diaspora, a community that is now grappling with the potential threat of an escalation in hostilities between the US and Iran. This story in the New York Times captures their reactions.
California lawmakers are returning to the capital with a long to-do list — topped by an ambitious proposal to start a $4. 2 billion climate bond. The funds would help the state prepare for dangerous natural disasters including worsening wildfires.
Solar surges. Why are conservationists upset?
Over 1 million rooftops are now capturing sunshine for energy across California — but clean energy advocates are concerned that the state will still fall short of its ambitious goals. Now, alongside industry officials, they are arguing for solar farms in the desert.
Unfortunately, that's put them at odds with environmental groups who don't want to see the infrastructure placed in or near fragile ecosystems. The battles are expected to blow up this year as California attempts to reach zero-emission electricity by 2045.
"California has set some good and aggressive climate targets, and getting there is going to require breaking ground that hasn't been broken before," Shannon Eddy, executive director of the Large-Scale Solar Association told The Desert Sun. "It requires very important conversations about land use, conversations that are deep and profound and difficult. . . . The whole world is facing these decisions on a macro level. "
A man and his leafblower help Oxnard
Marvin Boos is kind of a local hero. The 76-year-old Oxnard resident watched as his community grappled with the effects of a slashed budget, which took a toll on parks and sidewalks. Graffiti removal workers were let go, along with 16 of the city's 52 groundskeepers. Something had to be done — and Boos decided he would do it.
Instead of struggling past the overgrown shrubbery like many of his neighbors, he decided to take matters into his own hands, literally. Armed with a rake, shovel, dustpan, and hand saw, he cleaned the streets himself.

Texto completo: DraftKings is investigating whether Tolbert colluded with her husband
A woman named Jade Roper Tolbert took home the $1 million top prize in this past weekend's DraftKings Millionaire Maker daily fantasy contest, in which contestants assembled lineups from the players in the four NFL first-round playoff games. Usually, the winners of such contests go unnoticed outside the world of hardcore daily fantasy sports players, but Tolbert's status as a former contestant on 'The Bachelor' reality TV show " she appeared on the 19th season along with Season 2 of its 'Bachelor in Paradise' spinoff, both airing in 2015 " gave her victory a little more attention than usual.
Using terminology well known to 'Bachelor' fans, DraftKings tweeted out its congratulations to Tolbert on Sunday night after she ended up atop the Millionaire Maker standings. The tweet, which featured a rose emoji, was taken down Monday morning.
Tolbert acknowledged her victory after a Twitter user recognized her from 'The Bachelor.' She said she went against the advice of her husband " Tanner Tolbert, a contestant on 'The Bachelorette' Season 11 and 'Bachelor in Paradise' Season 2, where the two met " and started Seattle Seahawks wide receiver DK Metcalf, who had a massive game against the Philadelphia Eagles on Sunday and whose game-sealing 36-yard catch in the final minutes gave her the victory.
But almost immediately after her win, accusations of collusion began to fly among DFS players on social media. Observers noted that Tolbert and her husband each submitted the maximum 150 entries for the Millionaire Maker contest and that their entries seemed coordinated so that they generated the maximum number of possible lineups.
For instance, a renowned DFS expert and sports gambler named William Bierman noted that Jade's lineups contained almost zero quarterbacks who were started by her husband, with the former starting Deshaun Watson, Ryan Tannehill and Josh Allen in 95.33-percent of her lineups and the latter starting Drew Brees, Russell Wilson and Carson Wentz in 98.67-percent of his.
The rest of the lineups submitted by the two DFS players mostly overlapped, and despite Tolbert's claim that her husband told her not to start Metcalf, the Seahawks wide receiver was in 88-percent of the lineups she submitted and 78.67 percent of her husband's.
Through agent Paul Desisto, the Tolberts issued a statement Monday night in which they described Jade's win as 'pure luck' and questioned whether the accusations of collusion were motivated by sexism and the fact that the husband and wife already were in the public eye.
'We respect that DraftKings feels they must do their due diligence in regard to Jade winning their $1 million prize for the fantasy contest for the NFL's wild-card round this weekend,' the statement read. 'Though we must ponder, would the questions, accusations and curiosity about this win be the same if the winner had been male and someone who wasn't already in the public eye?'
DraftKings earlier said it is investigating whether the Tolberts colluded with each other.
'We take the integrity and fairness of our contests very seriously and are looking into this matter,' the company said in a statement released Monday morning.
'I understand everyone wants answers and we are trying to work quickly, but I personally just learned about this within the past hour or two,' DraftKings CEO Jason Robins wrote on Twitter on Monday afternoon.
DFS players collude to circumvent limits on the number of entries in a contest and to improve their chances of victory by submitting multiple lineups. DraftKings forbids such collusion, calling coordination between multiple players 'unacceptable behavior' on the 'Community Guidelines' section of its website. In its terms of use, DraftKings says 'colluding with any other individual(s) or engaging in any type of syndicate play' is considered 'conduct that would be deemed improper' and that such behavior may result in prize money being voided.
'The Company, at its sole discretion, may disqualify any entrant from a Contest, refuse to award benefits or prizes and require the return of any prizes, if the entrant engages in conduct or otherwise utilizes any information the Company deems to be improper, unfair or otherwise adverse to the operation of the Contest or is in any way detrimental to other entrants,' the terms of use state.
Some states that have DFS regulations also limit the number of entries a player may submit in each contest. (The limit usually is 150 or 3 percent of the total number of entries by all players for any contest, whichever is less.) Some states, such as Massachusetts, also require daily fantasy companies to ban players who attempt to play with more than one account. New York's rules state 'operators must take reasonable steps to prevent authorized players from submitting more than the allowable number of entries per contest.'
Daily fantasy sports exploded onto the landscape in the middle of the last decade, with advertisements promising large jackpots to average Joes saturating the television airwaves during NFL games. But companies such as DraftKings and FanDuel soon were the subject of scrutiny from lawmakers " who debated whether DFS constitutes gambling " and the media, who found that high-volume players " 'often aided by computer scripts and optimization software that allow players to submit hundreds or even thousands of lineups at a time,' the New York Times reported in 2015 " were winning most of the prizes at the expense of more inexperienced players. A 2015 McKinsey study cited by the Times found that in the first half of the 2015 Major League Baseball season, 91 percent of the prize money was won by 1.3 percent of the players.
To combat this negative press, DFS operators instituted limits on the number of entries each player may submit and crafted rules prohibiting players from colluding with one another. Nevertheless, such rules are difficult to enforce.

Pompeo decides against U.S. Senate run in Kansas

Texto completo: Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has decided not to run for the open U.S. Senate seat in Kansas this year, according to two people familiar with the matter.
Pompeo told Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) on Monday that he would remain at the State Department, three days after U.S. forces struck and killed a prominent Iranian general, triggering uncertainty in the region.
The two people spoke on the condition of anonymity to talk frankly about the matter.
McConnell had recruited Pompeo to run for Senate to guarantee the seat would stay in the hands of the Republican Party after the retirement of Sen. Pat Roberts.
Pompeo had regularly visited Kansas and was consulting with Ward Baker, a prominent GOP strategist close to McConnell. He had fueled speculation of a bid in recent weeks by creating personal social media accounts that regularly featured him with his family dog, cheering on sporting events and even drinking beer in his kitchen.
Pompeo was on Capitol Hill Monday to brief senators on the drone strike and the administration's plans going forward, according to Trump administration officials, and met with McConnell.
A person close to McConnell confirmed the meeting. 'Leader McConnell spoke with Secretary Pompeo this afternoon where he indicated he will not be running for Senate. Leader McConnell believes Secretary Pompeo is doing an incredible job as secretary of state and is exactly where the country needs him right now,' the person said.
The news on Pompeo's decision was first reported by the New York Times.
Aides said President Trump wanted Pompeo to stay on as secretary of state, particularly after the strike that killed a top Iranian military commander, Maj. Gen. Qasem Soleimani.
A State Department spokesperson did not offer an immediate comment.
For weeks, people close to Pompeo said he had misgivings about becoming a relatively junior senator from Kansas after leading the State Department and the CIA.
His status as the most influential and trusted Trump aide on matters of national security also gave him sway over momentous issues of global import, such as the decision to kill Soleimani. His ability to shape world events from the upper chamber of Congress would shrink significantly by comparison.
Declining to run for Senate would also afford him the opportunity to make more money in the private sector when he departs the administration through consulting, paid speeches and other lucrative jobs that have become commonplace for former Cabinet members.
Trump assembled one of the wealthiest Cabinets in modern American history, but Pompeo, a former congressman who previously had a lackluster business record in the aerospace industry, has a net worth that is far smaller than his colleagues.

Texto completo: Los Angeles prosecutors accuse movie producer of additional sex crimes
NEW YORK " Harvey Weinstein, the Hollywood producer who has come to symbolize the #MeToo movement, was charged with sex crimes in Los Angeles on Monday, hours after he slid his walker into a Manhattan courtroom for the start of his criminal trial here.
Weinstein " who is 67 but has visibly aged since his May 2018 arrest in New York " was in court with his five attorneys for a final conference before jury selection begins in his trial on rape and sexual assault allegations involving three women. He faces the possibility of life in prison in the New York case and has pleaded not guilty.
The charges filed in Los Angeles should not affect plans to proceed with jury pre-screening in New York Supreme Court in Manhattan, scheduled for Tuesday morning, and a spokesperson for the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office said that Weinstein is not expected to appear in court there until his trial in New York concludes.
His lawyers had no immediate comment on the new charges.
Last month, Weinstein and many of his accusers reached a proposed $25 million civil settlement, with the sum being paid to accusers by insurers for his former production company, which is in bankruptcy.
Weinstein remains under investigation by authorities in Dublin and London.
His case, first publicized in 2017 through detailed investigative reports published by the New Yorker and the New York Times, gave rise to the #MeToo movement and the professional downfall of several other prominent figures in entertainment, media and politics " men who found themselves accused of harassment, abuse and misconduct. #MeToo advocates say Weinstein's trial is historic and a symbol of women's voices being heard after generations of silence.
The charges in Los Angeles involve alleged encounters with two women, a day or two apart, in February 2013, authorities said. In all, eight people have come forward there to report crimes involving Weinstein, officials said. In three cases, the statute of limitations had expired, so charges were not filed. The other three remain under investigation.
Prosecutors in Los Angeles are recommending a $5 million bail in a case for which Weinstein faces up to 28 years in prison.
One set of charges relates to an encounter with a woman inside her hotel room during a Hollywood film festival, authorities said. Weinstein forced her to perform a sex act on him before raping her, according to a criminal complaint. The woman told investigators she did not report the crime at the time because Weinstein threatened her life.
The second accuser said Weinstein violated her in a Beverly Hills hotel bathroom after meeting him at a restaurant for what she thought was a business discussion, according to the complaint. He allegedly trapped her in the bathroom, showered briefly, and then masturbated while grabbing her breast, according to court papers.
'We believe the evidence will show that the defendant used his power and influence to gain access to his victims and then commit violent crimes against them,' Los Angeles County District Attorney Jackie Lacey said in a statement. 'I want to commend the victims who have come forward and bravely recounted what happened to them. It is my hope that all victims of sexual violence find strength and healing as they move forward.'
At Monday's hearing in New York, which concluded before officials' announcement in Los Angeles, Weinstein lawyer Arthur Aidala asked that the jury be sequestered to preempt the possibility that charges could be brought in another jurisdiction while the trial is underway. The request was denied, though the judge hinted he would revisit the question should charges emerge elsewhere.
Dozens of women have accused the former producer of sex crimes or sexual harassment. Several were on hand for a news conference outside the Manhattan courthouse, vowing support for the alleged victims and others expected to take the witness stand.
'As one of the silence-breakers, I stand in solidarity with the brave survivors who will take the stand against Harvey Weinstein in this trial,' said actress and early Weinstein accuser Rosanna Arquette. 'While emotion on this day runs high, I join these other brave women who are also harmed by Harvey Weinstein to say we aren't going anywhere.'
'Dear Harvey, no matter what lies you tell yourself, you did this. Today, Lady Justice is staring down a super predator. You brought this upon yourself by hurting so many,' added Rose McGowan, another actress and activist.
Attorney Douglas Wigdor, who has two clients suing Weinstein and represents one of the supporting witnesses expected to testify, said #MeToo rang in a new era in terms of how women are treated when lodging sexual assault accusations. The jurors who will be called in Weinstein's case know that victims 'aren't necessarily raped in dark alleys at gunpoint, that women often know their perpetrator, that women often speak to their perpetrator after the crime has been committed.'
Weinstein and his legal team have insisted he engaged only in consensual sexual activity.
Before the announcement in Los Angeles, Weinstein lawyer Damon Cheronis told reporters that if a new case were to emerge during his trial, 'it would be pretty obvious as to why' and 'the timing would be very suspect.' He did not elaborate.
Weinstein's team says he's anxious to have his day in court.
Aidala, in seeking the jury sequestering, said that 'the worst thing that can happen' is for Weinstein's trial in New York to be interrupted after several weeks and suggested that such a development after jury selection could lead to a mistrial.
'He's not looking for a mistrial. He's looking for a conclusion to this,' Aidala said.
Weinstein is out on $2 million bail and required to wear a monitoring bracelet. He is not allowed to leave the New York area. Los Angeles authorities have issued a warrant for his arrest, but authorities there indicated they will not seek his extradition or surrender until his trial ends.
Weinstein is on trial in Manhattan over allegations he raped a woman in 2013; she has not been publicly identified. The charges also include an allegation of forced sexual activity involving a former production assistant, Mimi Haleyi, in 2006.
A third woman, actress Annabella Sciorra, has accused Weinstein of sexually assaulting her in her Manhattan apartment in 1993. Prosecutors are expected to call her as a witness to support the multiple-victim requirement in the top count against Weinstein: predatory sexual assault.
Three additional women, including one who will say she was raped in 2005, are expected to be called as supporting witnesses but are not formally a part of the charges.
A lengthy jury selection process is expected, and testimony will not begin for at least two weeks.

Texto completo: The staff of Sports Illustrated plans to unionize, it told management Monday, saying it wants a greater say in the future of the iconic magazine and raising concerns about its direction under its new operator, Maven.
Of the 80 or so staffers eligible for the bargaining unit, more than 90 percent signed a petition supporting the union drive, according to organizers. Their quest to join the NewsGuild of New York comes at a time of turmoil for the magazine, according to staffers, who say Maven's leadership is jeopardizing SI's future.
'Decisions made by new management over the last few months have put SI's reputation and long-term health at risk,' the staffers told management in a letter outlining their concerns.
Maven, a Seattle-based media and technology company, took over editorial operations of SI in October after buying the rights to publish the magazine from its new owners. Around 40 SI staffers were laid off during the transition, and many of the remaining staffers have been raising concerns about SI's direction.
Last month, The Washington Post detailed incidents that troubled SI staffers. They included the launch of team-specific websites with little editorial oversight and a human-resources complaint that accused an executive of dangling a trip to a swimsuit- edition photo shoot as a reward for good work.
'The October layoffs at Maven's direction gutted our newsroom,' the staffers wrote to management. 'Two dozen employees who lost their jobs were women or people of color, leaving us less representative of the world we cover. Moreover, Maven's directive to launch a network of team reporters on SI's platforms without sufficient vetting or editorial oversight has already resulted in errors that severely undermine our credibility.'
Maven CEO James Heckman and the magazine's editors did not respond to messages seeking comment about the union push. When presented with his staff's concerns last month, Heckman told The Post in an email: 'We continue to be shocked about the state of the business, as we peel away layers " and so are moving boldly and decisively in parallel. Of course that makes everyone uncomfortable.'
Sports Illustrated, founded in 1954 and for decades the gold standard of sports journalism, has struggled to stay relevant in a rapidly evolving media landscape.
In their letter, staffers requested a pay-equity study, increased focus on minority hiring, clarity for workers on extended temporary contracts and clear protocols for handling harassment.

Texto completo: About three months before former auto titan Carlos Ghosn's escape last week from Japan to Lebanon , an operative helping plan his extraction visited Kansai International Airport in Osaka, Japan, and realized there was a huge security hole, according to a person familiar with the matter.
The terminal for private jets was quieter than those at most other airports and essentially empty, unless there was a flight coming in, this person said. What's more, oversize luggage was too big to fit in the airport scanners.
The security hole proved crucial in Mr. Ghosn's cinema-worthy escape from Japan, where he was out on bail facing charges of financial crimes. He has denied the charges and has previously said he would fight them in court.
The escape involved a 300-mile sprint across Japan, from Mr. Ghosn's court-monitored home in Tokyo to the Osaka airport. He was then smuggled inside a large black box, generally used for concert equipment, with breathing holes drilled in the bottom, into a waiting private jet, as previously reported by The Wall Street Journal.
The plan brought Mr. Ghosn through Turkey, where he changed planes in a predawn rainstorm, and on to Lebanon, where he holds citizenship. Lebanon doesn't extradite its citizens.
On board the plane in Osaka were two U.S. security operatives. One, Michael L. Taylor, is an ex-Green Beret with a history of rescuing hostages.
People familiar with Mr. Ghosn's thinking said he made his own, final decision to go through with the plan only late last month, after signs his trial might drag on for years, and amid the court's refusal for him to have contact with his wife during the holidays.
But work on a detailed plan to extract Mr. Ghosn started months beforehand, according to people familiar with the matter. The planning involved a team of between 10 and 15 people of different nationalities, one of these people said.
In all, the team took more than 20 trips to Japan and visited at least 10 Japanese airports before selecting the Osaka airport as a weak link, this person said.
A spokesman for the airport's operator said its security is no different from other airports in Japan. He said all luggage too large for X-ray scanning is supposed to be opened by security staff, but an airport-security expert said they don't necessarily do so for private-jet travelers as they are considered a lower terrorism risk. Unlike in the U.S., where security is handled by the government, in Japan airlines are responsible for security and use private security companies, the expert said.
Japanese officials said an investigation was under way to determine how Mr. Ghosn fled. Over the weekend, Japan's justice minister said departure checks would be strengthened.
Mr. Ghosn has previously said he arranged his travel to Lebanon on his own, without help from his family.
Arrested in November 2018 on charges of financial crimes related to his time leading Nissan Motor Co., Mr. Ghosn spent months in a small cell in Tokyo undergoing regular interrogation by prosecutors without a lawyer present.
Since being released on bail for the second time in April, he has had severe restrictions on contact with his wife and complained bitterly about a Japanese justice system that he felt was stacked against him. Japanese officials defended their system and said he would have received a fair trial.
The escape plan cost in the millions of dollars, according to the person familiar with the matter. In similar rescue missions, the exfiltration team typically would be paid expenses and then a hefty reward upon successful completion, security professionals said.
Also on the private-jet flight from Osaka was George Zayek, a Lebanese-born U.S. citizen who previously worked with Mr. Taylor's Boston-based security company.
Mr. Zayek is the brother of Elias Zayek, one of the founders of the Lebanese Forces militia. Elias Zayek was assassinated in 1990 a few months before the end of the Lebanese civil war. George Zayek was injured in fighting in Lebanon in the 1970s, leaving him with a limp, according to some relatives in Lebanon.
He left for the U.S. in the early 1980s, according to the relatives, and when his brother was killed he spent more time there, eventually becoming a U.S. citizen. He worked in private security with U.S. forces in Afghanistan and Iraq, these relatives said.
The 59-year-old Mr. Taylor's former Boston-based security company was hired by the New York Times to help rescue reporter David Rohde from Taliban captivity in Afghanistan in 2009.
Mr. Taylor recently has told friends he strongly empathized with Mr. Ghosn's legal plight following his own experience with the U.S. criminal-justice system that resulted in prison time.
Mr. Taylor was indicted in 2012 in two criminal cases related to a federal bid-rigging investigation into $54 million in Defense Department contracts. He disputed the charges, and spent 14 months in a local Utah jail under what he considered harsh conditions while awaiting trial. He eventually pleaded guilty to two counts and spent a total of 19 months behind bars.
After learning about Mr. Ghosn's case, Mr. Taylor referred to the embattled auto executive as a "hostage," said one person who knows him.

Mr. Taylor has also worked with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the State Department to rescue overseas kidnapping victims, and in the late 1980s worked four years undercover helping the U.S. government on a drug and money-laundering investigation, according to a sentencing memo by his attorney in his criminal case.
He has strong connections to Lebanon. He was deployed there as a Green Beret in the early 1980s, where he met his wife, and as a private contractor he later trained Lebanese Christian militias, the sentencing memo says. He speaks Arabic.

In 2012, Mr. Taylor was in Lebanon working on a classified case with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration when he was indicted. He flew back to the U.S. and was arrested on arrival in Utah, where the case was prosecuted.
"Mr. Taylor was the key player and critical link in one of the most important DEA operations in history," his lawyer wrote in the later sentencing memo. All but a few words about that operation were redacted in that memo.

Castro throws his support behind Warren, set to campaign this week

Texto completo: Julián Castro, the former US housing secretary whose progressive presidential candidacy did not make significant inroads with Democratic voters but earned plaudits from the party's left wing, has endorsed Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, offering a possible lift for her candidacy less than one month before the Iowa caucuses.
Castro revealed his endorsement Monday morning, just days after he ended his own bid for the White House. In a statement, Castro cast Warren as the logical extension of his campaign's social-justice-driven message, which seeks to correct inequities through targeted policy proposals. He will campaign with Warren this week, joining her Tuesday night at a rally at Kings Theatre in New York City.
The endorsement formalizes a partnership that could help Warren reignite excitement at a critical moment.
Warren has fallen from her polling peak in early October, when she was hailed as the front-runner and standard-bearer for the party's progressive wing. National polls now show Warren firmly in third, behind former vice president Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who has been aided by grass-roots progressive groups and by some high-profile endorsements of his own, including from popular House Democrats like Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez from New York, and Ilhan Omar from Minnesota.
It is unclear whether Castro's name carries similar political weight. His presidential candidacy struggled to break through in a significant way, but he led the field on a number of progressive issues, including reparations, border decriminalization, and housing inequality.
Warren thanked Castro for his support Monday, calling him “a powerful voice for bold, progressive change."

A Kennedy to run against Van Drew in New Jersey
A member of the Kennedy family, a former public school teacher, said Monday she will run as a Democrat against party-switching Republican US Representative Jeff Van Drew in New Jersey.
Amy Kennedy, who is married to former Democratic US representative Patrick Kennedy, revealed her candidacy for the 2nd District House seat in an online video.
Van Drew won election in 2018 as a Democrat but said last month he was becoming a Republican when he said he opposed impeaching President Trump. Trump praised Van Drew and hosted him at the White House, where the congressman pledged his support.
Kennedy, a yearslong resident of Brigantine, north of Atlantic City, highlighted the economy and environmental issues in the minutelong video announcing her run.
She also criticized the president and Van Drew for contributing to a decline in morality in public discourse.
A message seeking a response was left with Van Drew.
Van Drew's party switch has opened up a competitive Democratic primary, with Kennedy facing several challengers.
Among the competitors are Montclair State University political science professor Brigid Harrison, a longtime southern New Jersey resident who has garnered support from Democratic lawmakers already.
Atlantic County Freeholder Ashley Bennett has also said she is running. Former FBI agent Robert Turkavage is also in the race.

Pompeo tells McConnell he won't seek Senate seat
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Monday told Senator Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, that he does not plan to run for Senate in 2020, dashing Republicans' hopes of securing a dominant candidate for the open seat in his home state of Kansas, according to four people briefed on the meeting.
Pompeo, a former congressman from the Wichita area, has quietly explored a campaign for months. But in the aftermath of the military operation last week that killed General Qassem Soleimani of Iran, Pompeo has told senior party officials that he is ruling out becoming a candidate, according to several people who have spoken with him.
Pompeo still has time to change his mind. The filing deadline for the primary is not until June. However, administration officials who have spoken with him in recent days said he seemed adamant about not entering the race.
Without Pompeo in the race, Republicans face an unsettled primary that includes one candidate, Kris Kobach, whom party leaders fear could imperil their hold on a crucial open Senate seat. Kobach is popular with hard-right voters but widely disliked among moderates and independent voters.

The many reasons a conflict with Iran could spin out of control

Texto completo: This is how you bumble into a war.
U.S. administrations for years have weighed the pros and cons of going after Qassim Suleimani, the Iranian military official killed by a U.S. airstrike in Baghdad on Friday. Suleimani, the architect of efforts to build Iran’s regional influence, had plenty of blood on his hands, including that of American troops in Iraq.
But until Friday, American officials had always concluded that despite the trouble he caused, his death would cause even more trouble.
Foreign policy experts frequently warn in theory about how rivals can misread each other, and how that can lead to an escalation of conflict, resulting in a war no one wants. President Trump’s order to assassinate Suleimani provides a clear, practical illustration in how that could happen. The Trump administration is dealing with its first full-on foreign policy crisis. Not surprisingly, it’s one that is mostly of the president’s own making.
While Iran and the United States still can avoid a large-scale conflict, more people will die as a result of this attack. Some of them may be U.S. allies in Israel, Saudi Arabia or Europe. But Americans will die, too. They may be military or diplomatic personnel; they may be innocent civilians. They might be in the Middle East, Europe, the United States – almost anywhere.
Iran has to respond, both for reasons of prestige and retribution. As many have pointed out, assassinating Suleimani was akin to Iran killing the head of U.S. Central Command, at least one of the intelligence agencies, and/or the vice president – perhaps all rolled into one. Even if Suleimani’s use of Iranian forces and proxies in Syria, Lebanon, Iraq and Yemen have been disastrously counter-productive for his country, as New York Times columnist Tom Friedman argues, the Iranian leadership clearly doesn’t see it that way. It will act accordingly.
More moderate officials such as President Hassan Rouhani and Foreign Minister Javad Zarif, who already have lost authority for negotiating a nuclear agreement that Trump trashed, have no option but to go along.
The dangers in assassinating Suleimani are twofold, and interconnected. First, it was disproportionate, precisely the kind of response Trump claims to have eschewed by calling off airstrikes on Iran last summer after it shot down an American drone. An Iranian-allied militia killed an American contractor in Iraq; Trump responded with airstrikes on the militia. Iran’s backers attacked the U.S. Embassy compound in Baghdad (without actually getting into the Embassy or harming any U.S. personnel). Trump ordered an attack on Iran’s second-most important official. While the U.S. claims it acted to avert imminent attacks that Suleimani was planning, it has yet to produce evidence. Maybe there is evidence – but “imminent” is an elastic concept, particularly for someone who never cared much about telling the truth, anyway.
The second problem is that this kind of action makes it unclear to Iran what, exactly, the United States will do. Trump loves ambiguity as a pressure tactic. But governments usually strive to be very clear where their red lines are, and with good reason. Even if they don’t say exactly how they will respond to provocation, they try to leave little doubt that they will respond. They know that one of the quickest ways to a foreign policy crisis is through faulty assumptions about how an adversary will react.
While Trump has been consistent about pressuring Iran, he also wants to reduce the U.S. role in the Middle East, says he doesn’t want war and would be willing to hold high-level meetings with the Iranians. He has reduced the U.S. role in Syria, providing Iran with a golden opportunity. Even if he continues to squeeze Iran’s economy, he is easily distracted and has given Iran the impression he can be pushed around in the Middle East. Suleimani wanted to see just how far. That, too, turned out to be a miscalculation.
The Trump administration is predicting that Iran’s response will be limited. But a small-scale Iranian response would come across as timid. Threat and counter-threat built through the weekend. Trump said the United States had a list of more than 50 targets it would hit inside the country if Iran hit back hard. That would be another magnitude of escalation. Does Iran believe him this time? Does it care? Or would American airstrikes rally a divided and dispirited country? How do impeachment and a U.S. election campaign play into it?
Iran says it will no longer be bound by terms of the nuclear agreement, which it largely had adhered to even after Trump pulled out. Iraq’s parliament has voted to expel U.S. forces from the country. The list of potential targets for Iran and its allies is nearly endless. It can take its time. U.S. forces are spread across the region and oil shipments in the Gulf are vulnerable. Iran has ample proxies able to launch attacks that Tehran could cheer while claiming deniability.
Maybe there are enough cool heads left on both sides to keep things from spinning totally out of control. But there are many ways this could get much, much worse.

Texto completo: What do Jonas Brothers, Aerosmith, Queen, Backstreet Boys, Lady Gaga, the Shed at Hudson Yards, Post Malone, Lizzo and the Royal Opera House all have in common?
They worked with Tait in 2019.
Tait, the live-event industry’s biggest provider of staging and a power behind Rock Lititz, displayed its work worldwide at concerts, theaters, awards ceremonies and sporting events.
The company released its 2019 yearbook, which lists its more than 160 clients of 2019 as well as contributions to major live entertainment projects.

Noted liar Ben Rhodes touted as Iran expert by media

Texto completo: Either the press has a very, very short memory or it enjoys the abuse.

These are the only explanations for why newsgroups are giving former Obama White House staffer and admitted liar Ben Rhodes a platform to discuss the United States' long-overdue response to recent Iranian provocations.

President Barack Obama achieved “a deal good enough to prevent his successor from having to go to war with Iran,” Rhodes asserts in an op-ed published this weekend by the Atlantic. “But now, despite all that work, a de facto state of war exists between the United States and Iran. To keep his promise to kill an achievement of Obama’s, Donald Trump has been willing to break his promise to get us out of wars in the Middle East.”

“In doing so, he has tragically proved Obama right: The choice all along was between the Iran deal or an unconstrained Iranian nuclear program and some form of war,” he adds.

I am sorry, what? Rhodes’ op-ed appeared in the Atlantic? As in, the magazine whose editor-in-chief, Jeffery Goldberg, had to do damage control for himself in 2016 after New York Times Magazine reported that Rhodes used “handpicked Beltway insiders like Jeffrey Goldberg of The Atlantic” to help “retail the administration’s narrative” on the Iran nuclear deal? That Atlantic? You think that publication would have Rhodes on some sort of “no-fly” list, especially after he humiliated its editor-in-chief with the suggestion that they have an all-too-chummy relationship. But you would be wrong.

The Atlantic is not the only place where Rhodes, who is quite literally famous for lying to journalists, has resurfaced following the killing last week of Iranian Quds Force leader Qassem Soleimani. In the three days since Soleimani’s death, Rhodes has appeared on both CNN and MSNBC to offer his uniquely dishonest brand of analysis. He has also been quoted by the Washington Post, the New York Times, the Associated Press, and many more.

There is no reason why anyone should give Rhodes a megaphone to oppose current U.S. foreign policy toward Iran.

First, Rhodes is a liar. David Samuels’s 2016 New York Times Magazine profile of Rhodes includes a passage where the Obama flunky openly bragged that he manipulated reporters and pundits into advancing the Obama administration’s foreign policy agenda:
“All these newspapers used to have foreign bureaus,” [Rhodes] said. “Now they don’t. They call us to explain to them what’s happening in Moscow and Cairo. Most of the outlets are reporting on world events from Washington. The average reporter we talk to is 27 years old, and their only reporting experience consists of being around political campaigns. That’s a sea change. They literally know nothing.” […] In the spring of last year, legions of arms-control experts began popping up at think tanks and on social media, and then became key sources for hundreds of often-clueless reporters. “We created an echo chamber,” [Rhodes] admitted, when I asked him to explain the onslaught of freshly minted experts cheerleading for the deal. “They were saying things that validated what we had given them to say.” When I suggested that all this dark metafictional play seemed a bit removed from rational debate over America’s future role in the world, Rhodes nodded. “In the absence of rational discourse, we are going to discourse the [expletive] out of this,” he said. “We had test drives to know who was going to be able to carry our message effectively, and how to use outside groups like Ploughshares, the Iran Project and whomever else. So we knew the tactics that worked.” He is proud of the way he sold the Iran deal. “We drove them crazy,” he said of the deal’s opponents.
This is the man national news outlets are turning to for answers to the U.S.-Iran situation. Do these newsgroups not remember that Rhodes is a liar, or do they enjoy being used and abused in this way?

Rhodes also has an obvious and specific agenda, which is to advance his own legacy via rewriting the history of the since-scuttled Iran nuclear deal. What good reason is there for anyone to believe the former Obama aide would give a fair and objective analysis of what is happening or what may likely happen now between the United States and Iran? There is none. There is no good reason why anyone should trust Rhodes to discuss the Iran issue clearly and plainly. Rhodes has a history of flooding newsrooms with falsehoods and misleading statements, and there is no reason to believe he won't do it again, especially now that the Iran deal he brokered has fallen apart.

This is who Rhodes is, according to Rhodes.

Gina McCarthy and NRDC, together again

Texto completo: Congratulations are in order for former Environmental Protection Agency administrator Gina McCarthy. As of this week, she has been tasked with running an environmental group that, for many years, appeared to be running her federal agency.
The Natural Resources Defense Council, a behemoth among environmental nonprofit organizations, has named McCarthy its new president and chief executive officer, effective Jan. 6.
To call NRDC a "behemoth," though, is an understatement — and to refer to its hiring operation as part of a "revolving door" implies that there is any friction at all between this group and the federal regulatory bodies that it works to influence.
With NRDC sitting atop $182.3 million in revenue and a whopping $349.4 million in net assets, according to its most recent filing with the Internal Revenue Service, McCarthy will play a coveted role in the environmental hierarchy — one that has been rewarded with average annual compensation of $492,000 over the past five years. NRDC has not been shy about using these resources to bend the administrative state to its will.
From 2009 through 2016, the organization spent more than $4.9 million lobbying the federal government, including Ms. McCarthy’s agency directly, on items such as the Waters of the United States, or rule that would have decimated farmers’ ability to control their own land.
McCarthy acknowledged in 2015 that EPA decided to pursue WOTUS after “outside stakeholders asked us to do the rule.” NRDC, one of those stakeholders supportive of the rule, celebrated after its adoption, “Oh, happy day!”
It was a long time coming. High-level staffers from the nonprofit, known as the “NRDC mafia,” began filtering into EPA as soon as President Barack Obama took office.
The nonprofit organization’s political arm also began to flex its muscle, with NRDC Action Fund pumping thousands of dollars into the campaign coffers of powerful Democratic lawmakers. Beneficiaries included House Energy Committee Chairman Henry Waxman, a California Democrat, co-author of the ‘Waxman-Markey’ emissions-trading bill endorsed by the group, and vulnerable Democratic Sens. Mark Begich of Alaska, Kay Hagan of North Carolina, Gary Peters of Michigan, Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, and Mark Udall of Colorado, all of whom voted to confirm McCarthy to her EPA post.
But who needs Congress when you have deferential bureaucrats at the ready? That’s exactly the kind of assistance NRDC had in McCarthy.
Perhaps the best example is the revelation in June 2014 that three staffers at the nonprofit organization drafted the “blueprint” on which the Obama administration relied for drafting the Clean Power Plan, a regulation the New York Times described as “a remarkable victory for the Natural Resources Defense Council.” At a committee hearing the following month, McCarthy, under scrutiny, attempted to distance herself from the organization, claiming, “I have met many more times with utilities than I have the NRDC.”
Her narrative quickly unraveled.
In September 2014, as part of a joint committee investigation, six members wrote a letter to the Administrator, concluding that “NRDC’s unprecedented access to high-level EPA officials allowed it to influence EPA policy decisions and achieve its own private agenda.” One notable piece of evidence: An email between McCarthy and Dan Lashof — one-third of the NRDC trio that drafted the Clean Power Plan’s “blueprint” — about joining her team at EPA. The email was dated March 19, 2009, just days after her nomination as the agency’s assistant administrator.
She was further questioned in July 2015 about emails in which EPA’s policy director asked NRDC to write “a report or two” that would “provide cover for a draft EPA rule on new fossil power plants.” It wasn’t until December that emails obtained by the Energy & Environment Legal Institute revealed the same director had been keeping NRDC and other allies “apprised of internal EPA deliberations,” the Wall Street Journal reported, through the use of a private Yahoo account — a sure sign that the agency’s subordination to this group was even deeper than disclosed.
While this close relationship might have looked like a ‘brag sheet’ to NRDC’s donors, the resulting policies felt more like a nightmare to American families and workers.
In the press release announcing her new position, the former administrator claimed that NRDC “has never been stronger.” That may have been true under the Obama administration. But, thanks to three years of regulatory reforms and a spate of new federal judges who question the wisdom of blanket deference to the administrative state, hopefully, that will never be the case again.

Daily on Healthcare: SCOTUS asked to weigh in on big healthcare issues before presidential election

SCOTUS ASKED TO WEIGH IN ON BIG HEALTHCARE ISSUES: The Supreme Court has been asked to weigh in on partisan battles over the futures of Obamacare and abortion before the November elections.
There are incredibly high stakes, both politically and legally, should the justices decide to take up the issues. On Friday, Democrat-led states who are defending Obamacare asked the Supreme Court to consider the constitutionality of the healthcare law so that a decision on the case would land this year. The states, led by California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, stressed in their request that there is otherwise too much uncertainty among patients and healthcare providers.
The court tends not to take up cases that are still being litigated. And an appeals court sent this particular case back to the lower courts, making it likely to punt any decisions by the high court until far after the 2020 election. Only four justices are needed to hear a case, but the court would need to pick up a fifth conservative justice to expedite oral arguments. The letter from Democrat states asks the justices to hear the case April 29 or at a special sitting in May. That means that a decision over whether all of Obamacare would be thrown out would certainly arrive ahead of Nov. 3, 2020.
On abortion, the court has already agreed to hear June Medical Services v. Gee on March 4, to weigh in on whether Louisiana should be allowed to mandate that doctors who provide abortions also have admitting privileges at local hospitals. But at least 207 members of Congress, all of them Republicans except for Democrats Dan Lipinski and Collin Peterson, want the justices to weigh in on whether Roe v. Wade "should be reconsidered and, if appropriate, overruled." If Roe were to be overturned, then abortion would become illegal in some states.
Abortion rights groups have been concerned about the weakening or overturning of Roe since the Republican-controlled Senate confirmed two of President Trump's Supreme Court appointees, Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh. The Louisiana case, even without a broader ruling on Roe, would provide the first big test for how the justices deliberate on abortion.

NIH head: ‘Very premature’ to see future of medical research without animal testing: Researchers have found some ways to test drugs without using animals, such as through the use of chips that have human cells on them, but even those are far from what they need to be to make sure drugs are safe and effective, National Institutes of Health Director Francis Collins said in an interview with C-SPAN “Newsmakers” that aired over the weekend. The Washington Examiner asked Collins about the future of research involving animals, and whether there were opportunities to use fewer animals or even whether it might become commonplace not to use animals at all.
“We will, I hope someday get there, but it would be very premature at the present time to say we have the kind of information we need to be able to do research that ultimately will lead to outcomes for humans that are what we need them to be, which is safe and effective,” Collins said. He noted that a treatment for Ebola was found by testing on monkeys, and stressed it was important for researchers to be able to use animals in research so that humans — such as a child with a rare disease — don’t have drugs tested on them before scientists can collect data about side effects. “If people are going to argue, 'Let’s give up animals,’ think about the consequences. They would be major,” Collins said.
THE 2020 ELECTION RENEWS THE QUESTION OF HOW MUCH CANDIDATES SHOULD SHARE ABOUT THEIR HEALTH: Trump and presidential candidates, including Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, and Michael Bloomberg have released only brief summaries of their health, calling into question whether they should provide more details to show America they’re strong enough for the nation’s top job. Arthur Caplan, founding head of the Division of Medical Ethics at NYU School of Medicine, said that the existing practices for disclosing medical info appear to be “driven purely by politics, not making any medical sense.”
Doctors are prohibited from releasing medical records without consent from their patients, but University of Wisconsin bioethicist Robert Streiffer said candidates’ doctors may be morally obligated to release health records: “There is an ethical dilemma for the doctor, or there could be, because they are acting as an agent of the candidate but also an obligation to the public with who they are sharing information with.” So should candidates be required to publicize their health records? S. Jay Olshansky, a leading researcher on aging from the University of Illinois at Chicago, said he isn’t sure: “I’m a fan of privacy, but then again, we are talking about a very unique position, and maybe there should be an exemption.”
A LOOK AT HOW WARREN IS TRYING TO MANEUVER THE ‘MEDICARE FOR ALL’ DISCUSSION: Warren tried to finesse "Medicare for all" Sunday on CNN’s State of the Union when host Jake Tapper asked why her plan to phase-in changes to the healthcare system is better than what Sanders is offering. After Tapper asked initially, Warren did not answer the question directly, saying that the U.S. has plenty of money to provide coverage for all Americans, who should be able to “experience what this is about.” When Tapper followed up, Warren said her transition plan would provide the quickest possible route to getting people covered under “Medicare for all”: “Help starts on day one. And then it’s full healthcare coverage for 135 million people.”
In case you forgot: Warren released her transition plan in November, which includes pushing for a bill to provide Americans the option of buying a government insurance plan within her first 100 days. By her third year in office, Warren would complete the transition to a Medicare for all plan. Sanders, on the other hand, has pledged to introduce “Medicare for all” legislation within his first week in office.
TERMINALLY ILL TEXAS INFANT CAN STAY ON LIFE-SUPPORT, APPEALS COURT SAYS: A Texas appeals court decided Friday night that Tinslee Lewis, an 11-month-old baby with chronic lung and heart diseases, can stay on life support for a bit longer, undoing a Thursday decision to allow Cook Children’s Medical Center to take Tinslee off life-sustaining machines. The latest decision will allow her mother more time to find another hospital willing to treat Tinslee’s condition, which her doctors say will not improve, until the court issues a final ruling on the case.
Tinslee was born with a rare heart defect — Ebstein’s anomaly — that prevents one of her valves from closing properly, keeping her blood from flowing in the right direction. She was also born with chronic lung disease and is currently connected to ventilators keeping her alive. Her doctors say not only that her condition will not improve, but also that Tinslee is in constant pain, as she is hooked up to life-sustaining machines including ventilators and feeding tubes. The Cook Children’s Hospital ethics committee had decided to invoke a state law giving the family 10 days to find an alternative facility willing to treat Tinslee. So far, neither Tinslee’s mother nor Cook Children’s has been able to find another doctor to take the case.

Texto completo: Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has reportedly notified the Senate's top Republican that he will not run for a Kansas seat in the upper chamber in 2020.
Pompeo met with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to inform him of the decision on Monday, telling him he does not intend to launch a bid for retiring GOP Sen. Pat Roberts's seat, according to the New York Times.
The secretary of state has never publicly entertained a Senate run, but his frequent visits to Kansas and reports of meetings with top GOP donors fueled rumors he was considering running. Several top GOP lawmakers, including McConnell, reportedly lobbied Pompeo to launch a bid to replace Roberts.
"He loves doing the job he’s doing right now and feels that things are too volatile with the various situations around the world, particularly with Iran and Iraq, and he wants to make sure he’s in the best spot to serve his country," a source close to Pompeo told the Wall Street Journal. "He believes that is secretary of state."
Pompeo’s decision comes days after the United States killed a top Iranian general, placing the U.S.'s Middle East policy in turmoil amid the threat of Iranian retaliation. President Trump authorized the drone strike that killed Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani last week. Iran later pledged to respond to the U.S. attack, and Trump promised "major retaliation" against Iran if it did so.
Without Pompeo in the Kansas race, former Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, who was defeated in the state's 2018 gubernatorial race, is looking to clinch the Republican nomination.

New York City medical examiner stands by conclusions on Epstein suicide

Texto completo: New York City’s medical examiner stood by her conclusion that sex offender Jeffrey Epstein died via a suicide by hanging amid scrutiny of the circumstances surrounding the financier’s death in his prison cell last summer.
When asked to respond to Sunday’s 60 Minutes exposé, which included comments from a celebrity forensic pathologist doubtful of the official conclusions and newly released pictures of Epstein’s bruised neck and from inside his cell after his death, a representative for chief medical examiner Barbara Sampson declined to provide new details.

“We can’t answer more specific questions around this ongoing investigation at this time, but we refer you to our previous statements,” the medical examiner’s office told the Washington Examiner on Monday.
When asked if this meant Sampson was standing by her findings that Epstein killed himself, the representative replied: “Yes, that is fair.”
Epstein was found dead in his prison cell in NYC’s Metropolitan Correctional Center early on Aug. 10.
Dr. Michael Baden, who briefly held the same role as Sampson in the late 1970s and went on to become a controversial celebrity medical examiner, was hired by Epstein’s younger brother, Mark Epstein, to conduct an investigation.
Baden observed the four-hour autopsy by Sampson’s office and said he believed the current evidence made it more likely Epstein was a victim of a homicidal strangulation rather than suicide, pointing to the injuries to Epstein’s neck.
"There were fractures of the left, the right thyroid cartilage, and the left hyoid bone — I have never seen three fractures like this in a suicidal hanging,” Baden said. “Going over a thousand jail hangings, suicides in the New York City state prisons over the past 40 to 50 years, no one had three fractures.”
Baden said he understood if people thought he was biased due to being paid by Epstein’s brother but claimed “our job is to find what the truth is … just to find out whether it's a homicide or a suicide,” and added, “I hesitate, as usual, to make a final opinion until all the evidence is in.”
But the NYC medical examiner’s office has stood “firmly” by its findings.
“Our investigation concluded that the cause of Mr. Epstein’s death was hanging and the manner of death was suicide, and we stand by that determination,” Sampson said in October when Baden’s claims were first made public. “We continue to share information around the medical investigation with Mr. Epstein's family, their representatives, and their pathology consultant. The original medical investigation was thorough and complete. There is no reason for a second medical investigation by our office.”
“In general, fractures of the hyoid bone and the cartilage can be seen in suicides and homicides,” Sampson told the New York Times.

“In forensics, it’s a general principle that all information from all aspects of an investigation must be considered together,” Sampson told the Associated Press. “You can’t draw a conclusion from one finding. Everything about the case has to be considered.”

Epstein allegedly sexually exploited and abused dozens of minor girls at his homes in Manhattan, New York, and Palm Beach, Florida, among other locations, between 2002 and 2005, and perhaps beyond. Prosecutors claimed Epstein enticed and recruited minor girls to engage in sex acts with him and built a “vast network of underage victims.”

The Justice Department charged two prison guards, Tova Noel and Michael Thomas, with dereliction of duty and falsifying records while covering up their failure to conduct their rounds and wellness checks the night Epstein died. Both pleaded not guilty, and the ongoing criminal case has been cited by the DOJ and the Bureau of Prisons to justify their relative silence about Epstein’s death. Attorney General William Barr said he personally reviewed security footage showing no one else entered Epstein’s cell the night he died.
The jet-setting financier’s friendships with people such as former President Bill Clinton, the U.K.'s Prince Andrew, and others have come under increased scrutiny following his death, while Epstein's victims continue fighting for accountability.

Susan Rice says Iranian attacks inevitable: ‘Terrorist sleeper cells could be activated’

Texto completo: President Barack Obama’s national security adviser Susan Rice claimed that terrorists embedded in the United States “could be activated” as Iran inches toward conflict with the U.S.
Rice argued in a column that President Trump’s decision to kill Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani made Iranian attacks against Americans inevitable. She wrote in the New York Times: “Despite President Trump’s oft-professed desire to avoid war with Iran and withdraw from military entanglements in the Middle East, his decision to order the killing of Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, Iran’s second most important official, as well as Iraqi leaders of an Iranian-backed militia, now locks our two countries in a dangerous escalatory cycle that will likely lead to wider warfare.”
She said she did not believe the Trump administration's statement that Soleimani’s death was necessary to prevent an “imminent” attack against Americans because Trump’s team “lies almost daily about matters large and small.” Rice went on to argue that “even if” Trump’s decision to kill Soleimani, who was responsible for the death of at least 608 American troops, was justified, she would have advised against it.
Rice, 55, wrote that Trump’s decision triggered a series of events that are all bad for American interests, including the fallout in Iraq as the parliament orders U.S. forces to leave in a manner that could help the Islamic State regain traction in the area. She also noted that the threats could also spread beyond the Middle East.
“Even in the United States, we have reason to fear that terrorist sleeper cells could be activated,” she wrote. "Worse, we face these threats now substantially alone, as the Trump administration apparently neglected to consult or even warn our key allies and partners about the impending risks to their interests that result from killing General Soleimani.”
Sleeper cells are individuals within a given country that are sent to blend in and lead normal lives with the intention of activating them to carry out attacks at a later date. These individuals have been called to carry out attacks around the globe.
She added that she believes it will be “difficult for the United States to de-escalate tensions” in Iran following Soleimani’s death and claimed that she can’t imagine the situation ending without a full-scale war.
“If [Trump] reacts with additional force, the risk is great that the confrontation will spiral into a wider military conflict. If he fails to react in kind, he will likely invite escalating Iranian aggression,” she explained. “It’s hard to envision how this ends short of war.”
Rice was in the Obama administration during the negotiations for the Iran nuclear deal. Trump ordered the U.S. to withdraw from the deal shortly after taking office. Iran scrapped the remainder of its global ties in the deal on Sunday and announced that it would expand its uranium enrichment process. Rice called Trump a "wrecking ball" after he announced that he was leaving the nuclear deal.
Trump’s decision to strike Soleimani came after months of Iranian aggression toward the U.S., including an attack on the U.S. Embassy in Iraq and the death of an American contractor.

"Nice day at the range," wrote Trump Jr. "@rarebreedfirearms and @spikes_tactical adding a little extra awesome to my AR and that mag..."
During the second presidential debate of the 2016 election, Trump's father, President Trump, told then-Democratic nominee Clinton that she was lucky he wasn't president because "you'd be in jail."
A SurveyMonkey/Axios poll released over the weekend showed that Trump Jr. is a favorite for the 2024 GOP nomination among Republican voters should he choose to run.
Trump Jr. thanked "Deplorables" after his 2019 book Triggered topped the New York Times best-sellers list. Deplorables is a term that Clinton used to describe Trump supporters who should be shamed and dismissed.

'No combat veterans left in the race': War hero Democrat jabs 'analyst' Buttigieg on military service

Texto completo: Decorated Marine combat veteran and congressman Seth Moulton downplayed the importance of Pete Buttigieg's military experience in the wake of Iranian Quds Force commander Qassem Soleimani's death.
“There’s no combat veterans left in the race. I have tremendous respect for Pete’s service as an analyst, but analysts don’t make decisions,” Moulton told the New York Times. A House representative from Massachusetts, Moulton also briefly sought the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.
Buttigieg, 37, the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, and a leading Democratic presidential candidate, has stressed his Navy background when criticizing the strategy behind President Trump’s ordered killing of Soleimani and to blunt criticism that he is too young and inexperienced to be in the Oval Office.
“As a military intelligence officer on the ground in Afghanistan,” Buttigieg said in Iowa on Friday, “I was trained to ask these questions before a decision is made.”
While Buttigieg has been described as a combat veteran because he was deployed to a war zone, he never fired his weapon, came under fire, or fought in battle. He served in the Navy Reserve from 2009 to 2017 and attained the rank of lieutenant. During his first mayoral term in 2014, Buttigieg served about six months in Kabul, Afghanistan. He spent much of his time behind a desk as an intelligence officer but has often mentioned that he left the safety of the military base and "crossed the wire" 119 times, by his own count, while driving an armored vehicle.
Moulton, 41, served four tours in Iraq while he was a Marine Corps officer from 2001 to 2008 and was awarded two bronze stars and a Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medal for valor. Part of one of the first American units to reach Baghdad in 2003, Moulton led troops into battles where some were wounded or killed.
Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, 38, is another veteran still seeking the Democratic presidential nomination who was deployed to a combat zone. She deployed to Iraq for 12 months with the Hawaii Army National Guard starting in 2004 and was awarded a Combat Medical Badge for supporting infantry engaged in active combat. In 2009, she led a military police platoon in Kuwait. Gabbard is still in the Hawaii Army National Guard, where she is a major.
Presidential candidates have often come under fire for embellishing or avoiding military service.
Last May, Buttigieg went after Trump for receiving a diagnosis of bone spurs in his heels from his father's doctor in 1968 to avoid the Vietnam draft. When John Kerry was the 2004 Democratic presidential nominee, a Republican-funded group highlighted veterans who alleged that he lied to get some of his military decorations. President Bill Clinton took heat during his 1992 campaign for enrolling in but not joining the ROTC as a way to avoid the draft, and President George W. Bush joined the Texas Air National Guard days before his student draft deferment expired, which allowed him to fulfill service in Texas rather than Vietnam.
Moulton has not endorsed any of his former competitors in the Democratic presidential field, but he has hinted preference toward former Vice President Joe Biden.
“There’s only one candidate who has had to make life-or-death decisions involving American lives, and that’s Vice President Biden,” Moulton said.
Moulton stressed how much he values hands-on military experience in an interview with the Washington Examiner days after he ended his presidential bid in August 2019.
“I have a lot of respect for Tulsi and Pete for their service,” Moulton said. “They did incredibly important service overseas. But I also think that the on-the-ground leadership experience that I uniquely had in this race should be valued for making our commander in chief.”

Texto completo: The joke police are back!

Reporters and pundits are again debating whether the Babylon Bee, a conservative satirical website, should be allowed to operate unchecked given today's heated political climate.

“A post from a satirical website has been shared more than 500k times saying the DNC called for the flag to be at half-mast because of Soleimani,” Daily Beast contributor Cindy Otis tweeted this weekend. “Some family members just called bc their Republican friends on FB are circulating it like it's legit. We have a lot of work to do, all.”

The Babylon Bee article in question is titled: “Democrats Call For Flags To Be Flown At Half-Mast To Grieve Death Of Soleimani.” It is quite clearly a joke. And a funny one.

Otis added, “You'll see it's also circulating on Twitter. Many accounts sharing it as funny satire, some sharing it because they say it's satire but still close to the truth, and others that appear to not know at all that it's satire.”

Her concerns were echoed elsewhere by CNN disinformation reporter Donie O’Sullivan, who tweeted, “To put this in perspective, this is the same number of engagements the top NY Times and CNN stories on Facebook had over the past week. A lot of people sharing this ‘satirical’ story on Facebook don't know it is satire.”

O’Sullivan, who, by the way, happens to be a fan of the satirical site the Onion, added, “Having a disclaimer buried somewhere on your site that says it’s ‘satire’ seems like a good way to get around a lot of the changes Facebook has made to reduce the spread of clickbait and misinformation.”

If it was just these two Twitter users complaining about the Babylon Bee, this would not be worthy of comment. But their remarks follow a monthslong effort by reporters, commentators, and entire news organizations to warn readers of the supposed threat that the Christian satirical website poses to the republic.

“The line between misinformation and satire can be thin, and real consequences can result when it is crossed,” the New York Times warned of the Babylon Bee in August 2019. “On social media, parody can be misconstrued or misrepresented as it moves further and further from its source. And humor has been weaponized to help spread falsehoods online.”

An article from Harvard’s Nieman Lab, of the Nieman Foundation for Journalism, published at around the same time cautioned, “Maybe you know that article is satire, but a lot of people can’t tell the difference.”

Snopes, which has published numerous “fact-checks” of the Babylon Bee’s satirical work, has gone so far as to promote a junk study “proving” the conservative comedy site is a public risk.

The “fracas” between the Babylon Bee and Snopes, Poynter argued in March 2018, “highlights the notoriously thin line between satire and misinformation. Even if a story’s intention is to entertain, the effect could still be misinformation if the headline is believable enough.”
The media-led campaign to warn the public of the dangers posed by the conservative parody site is rich, considering it comes at the tail end of the decadeslong fad of satirical political shows hosted by “news anchors” such as Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert. Indeed, after 15-plus years of living in the shadow of beloved and acclaimed then-Comedy Central hosts, it is laugh-out-loud funny that members of the press are getting bent out of shape now over a single conservative satirical website.

Political satire was not a threat to democracy during the first decade of the war on terror, back when Stewart fed his viewers a steady diet of deceptively edited interviews. Political satire was not even a threat when voters said they got their news from Stewart and the number of the shows that parodied his format. Polls that showed voters relied on the former Comedy Central host as a source of actual news information, despite his obvious gimmick as a partisan activist, did not inspire panic or anger in the press. Quite the opposite, actually. The Newseum even honored Stewart in 2019 with his own display, praising the "news" anchor for becoming the “go-to source for information for a new generation of news consumers,” adding that many “viewers considered Stewart a more trusted source for news than actual broadcast journalists.
I guess you could say it is different, what the Babylon Bee does. For example, the Bee does 100% fewer selectively edited hit jobs. Another big difference is that the Babylon Bee mercilessly ridicules Democrats and liberals. That makes its work no laughing matter, according to members of our distinguished press.

Texto completo: Democrats should know their whining about the legal basis for the drone strike on Qassem Soleimani is kind of pointless when even the New York Times has dismissed it.
The Times editorial board on Friday said that the “real question” to ask about the strike is “not whether it was justified, but whether it was wise.”
True.
This White House, picking up where President Barack Obama left off, says it had the authority for the attack because Soleimani posed an immediate threat to the United States and because Congress several years ago passed legislation allowing the president to act militarily in Iraq.
Yes, the Trump administration is taking a lot of liberties with its interpretation of the law. Obama did when he greatly expanded the use of targeted drone strikes against suspected terrorists, which has effectively been a run around capturing and trying them in court.
But we didn’t just take out Pope Francis. It was Soleimani, who the New York Times described as an “indisputably an enemy of the American people, a critical instrument of the Iranian theocracy’s influence across the Middle East and an architect of international terrorism responsible for the deaths of hundreds of Americans and a great many others in the region, from Yemen to Syria.”
Soleimani may just not be the one worth getting into a constitutional debate over.

Narges Bajoghli: Soleimani’s death changes nothing in Iran

Texto completo: The assassination of Maj. Gen. Qassim Soleimani of Iran by the United States was an unprecedented escalation in the 40-year standoff between the two countries. General Soleimani was the powerful head of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps’ special operations forces, the Quds Force, and we can expect retaliation across the region. But the killing will not in itself weaken the Revolutionary Guards or Iran’s role in the region.
The idea that General Soleimani was all powerful and that the Quds Force will now retreat, or that Iran’s ties with Shiite armed groups in Iraq and Lebanon like Hezbollah will suffer, belies a superficial, and frankly ideological, understanding of Iran and the Revolutionary Guard.
Consider how similar assassinations have played out. The 2008 assassination of a top Hezbollah leader, Imad Mugniyah, did not weaken the group — in fact, the reverse happened. Likewise, years of targeted assassinations against Hamas in Gaza haven’t dismantled that organization. The Revolutionary Guards and the Islamic Republic are bigger and more powerful than either of those groups.
To understand the structure of the Revolutionary Guards, it is important to understand the Iran-Iraq war (1980-88). It was on the battlefields of this conflict, the 20th century’s longest conventional war, that the guards formed their battle-hardened culture and leadership ethos. Faced with an Iraqi military that was heavily supplied by the United States and the West, the guards learned how to fight asymmetrically, a strategy that it has since perfected. That means, above all, devolving decision-making to small, often ad hoc groups, operating semi-independently against much larger forces.
In my 10 years of research in Iran with the Revolutionary Guards, one of my key observations was that wherever they operate, in Iran or on foreign battlefields, they function with that same ad hoc leadership: Decisions and actions don’t just come from one man or even a small group of men; many within the organization have experience building relationships, creating strategies and making decisions.
This contrasts with General Soleimani’s public image, both at home and abroad, which, since 2013, has been propped up by a vast media campaign. I followed some of his media team during my research and saw how they produced films, documentaries and even music videos, in both Persian and Arabic, lionizing his feats against the Islamic State. Inside Iran, he consistently polled among the most popular figures in the regime. The fact that most of his activities took place outside Iran helped preserve his reputation in the often fractious politics of the Islamic Republic.
It is likewise hard to overstate the symbolic power of General Soleimani in the region, particularly among Arab Shiite groups in Iraq and Lebanon. He was the face of Iranian power from Lebanon to Yemen, a face that brought money, weapons and advisers. Yet he wasn’t the only person in the Revolutionary Guards who built such personal relationships, as the Western news media tends to depict. Far from it.
Thanks to the guards’ ad hoc structure, the relationship between the Revolutionary Guards and Iraqi and Lebanese Shiite armed groups is a long and deep one. During my time in Lebanon and Iran, I met foreign militants who spent long stretches in Iran, for both work and pleasure. They spoke fluent Persian and fully understood the Revolutionary Guards ethos. The ties that bind many of these groups together include generations of marriage, commerce, history and culture. General Soleimani, as important as he was, was not singular.
Iran and its populations have thousands of years of history in the region. That doesn’t get “rooted out” with assassinations and missile strikes. These relationships — among Revolutionary Guards cadres and between the guards and their allies abroad — are deep, and they do not rely on one figure. In fact, Iran has already named General Soleimani’s longtime deputy, Ismail Qaani, as his successor.
Given the intense political infighting inside Iran following the heavy-handed crackdown of the state on protesters in November, the assassination of General Soleimani is a convenient opportunity to unify the country. The Islamic Republic knows how to create consensus in the face of an external enemy: It did so during the Iran-Iraq war, in the fight against the Islamic State and against American sanctions.
In this way, General Soleimani’s influence will survive him; in fact, it may have suddenly grown significantly. The United States just killed a very popular figure within powerful armed circles across the region. And he was not the only leader with strategic and battle experience who wished to see the United States leave the region. This was a highly symbolic assassination. The problem for the United States is that symbolism has the power to move people to action.

What is Trump’s Iran strategy? Few seem to know.

Texto completo: When the United States announced Friday that it had killed Maj. Gen. Qassem Soleimani, something about its explanation left many analysts puzzled.
The strike was intended to deter further Iranian attacks, administration officials said. But it was also expected to provoke severe enough attacks by Iran that the Pentagon was deploying an additional several thousand troops to the region.
The apparent contradiction left many experts wondering about the strike’s intended goal and the strategy behind it.
The next day did little to settle the matter. The strike had been intended to prevent an imminent Iranian attack, officials said publicly. Or to change the behavior of Iran’s surviving leaders. Or to cow those leaders, whose behavior would never change.
Others said privately that President Donald Trump had ordered it in response to television reports of an Iranian-backed siege on the U.S. Embassy compound in Baghdad.

Soleimani’s killing has left a swirl of confusion among analysts, former policymakers and academics. The United States had initiated a sudden, drastic escalation against a regional power, risking fierce retaliation, or even war.
Why?
“There’s not a single person that I’ve spoken to who can tell you what Trump is up to with Iran,” said Ellie Geranmayeh, an analyst at the European Council on Foreign Relations.
It’s not that experts or foreign officials suspect a secret agenda, but that the administration’s action fit no clear pattern or long-term strategy, she said. “It just doesn’t add up.”
The killing, many say, deepens the uncertainty that has surrounded Trump’s ambitions toward Iran since he withdrew the United States from the 2015 nuclear accord and began a series of provocations that he terms maximum-pressure.
The risk, experts say, is that if they cannot figure out the administration’s goals and priorities for Iran, its red lines and points of possible compromise, then foreign governments will not be able to either.
“Absolutely not,” Geranmayeh said when asked whether European or Middle Eastern officials, whom she speaks with regularly, understood Trump’s strategy. “Not even the closest U.S. allies, like in London.”
This imposes a layer of confusion on the conflict, just as it enters a dangerous and volatile new chapter, inviting mixed messages and misread intentions.
“If it’s that hard for us to understand, imagine the Iranians,” said Dalia Dassa Kaye, who directs a Middle East policy center at RAND Corp., a nonpartisan research group.
Mixed signals, she said, make any effort to shape an adversary’s behavior “incredibly ineffective.” Uncertainty about Trump’s intentions also increases risks that the conflict could spiral out of control.
Without a clear understanding of what actions will lead the United States to ramp up or ramp down hostilities, she said, Iranian leaders are operating in the dark — and waiting to stumble past some unseen red line.
“That’s what makes this a dangerous situation,” she said.
How confusion fell over America’s Iran strategy
Part of the uncertainty is specific to Trump. His impulsive style and resistance to accepting difficult trade-offs have made his goals on Iran difficult to parse.
He has cycled between ambitions of withdrawing from the Middle East, positioning himself as a once-in-a-generation peacemaker and, more recently, promising to oppose Iran more forcefully than any recent president has.
He has also been pulled between his advisers, with some urging cautious adherence to the status quo and others arguing for overtly topping Iran’s government.
Trump’s reputation for distortions and untruths have also made it difficult to separate bluster from agenda-setting.
He took the United States out of the nuclear agreement and imposed sanctions against Iran — which some see as setting off a crisis that continue today — on claims that it was “on the cusp” of acquiring nuclear weapons “in just a short period of time.”
But international inspectors and U.S. military leaders said that Iran was complying with requirements to freeze its nuclear development.
Without a clear explanation for Trump’s behavior, anyone whose job requires forecasting the next U.S. action — from foreign head of state to think tank analyst — was left guessing.
Deepening the challenge, the administration followed up with a set of demands that included some nuclear restrictions but focused mostly on Iran’s regional influence and proxy forces, ordering Tehran to sever ties to nearly all of them in a sweeping surrender.
Was this the real agenda? If so, what were the plans for winning each demand, and the metrics for measuring whether those plans were working? How would the administration balance competing priorities?
U.S. action on the ground deepened confusion. U.S. diplomacy has emphasized calls for peace but has conspicuously declined to offer what diplomats call “offramps” — easy, low-stakes opportunities for both sides to begin de-escalating, which are considered essential first steps.
“There’s been no talk of, say, ‘If you do this, then we’ll bring back waivers,’” Kaye said, referring to U.S. waivers allowing other countries to buy Iranian oil. “‘If you do X, then you’ll get Y.’ There’s been nothing tangible like that.”
Throughout months of proxy conflict, U.S. military responses have ranged from muted or nonexistent — as in the case of an attack on Saudi oil facilities that was believed to be the work of Iran — to extreme escalations like killing Soleimani.
Even if each action might be defensible on its own, experts and foreign officials have strained to match them with a consistent set of motives and objectives.
Suspicions have deepened that there may be no long-term strategy at all, even among those sympathetic to Trump’s policies.
R. Nicholas Burns, a senior State Department official under President George W. Bush, wrote on Twitter that the United States might have had a “legitimate right” to kill Soleimani.
But, he asked, “has Trump considered next 15 moves on chessboard? How to protect our people? Line up allies to support us? Contain Iran but avoid wider war? My guess is he hasn’t.”
Stumbling in the dark
Geranmayeh stressed that the conflict between the United States and Iran also threatens to draw in a host of Middle Eastern and European countries.
To navigate tensions and avoid worsening them, allies and adversaries alike must astutely judge U.S. intentions and anticipate U.S. actions.
All of them, she said, seemed at a loss.
“Most experts and officials that I’ve spoken to from the Middle East, including close allies — Saudi Arabia, Israel — they also can’t tell you with confidence what Trump wants on Iran,” she said.
Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates had already been ramping down tensions with Iran, Geranmayeh said, “because they have no idea how Trump will behave from one week to the next” and fear getting caught in the middle.
Similar confusion in Tehran, she added, could become “the biggest problem.”
“If Trump is not managing a consistent and clear message to the Iranians about what he wants,” she said, “then this opens up a lot of space for a lot of miscalculation.”
The most important question, Kaye said, is what steps by Iran might cause Trump to pull back. “There’s not an understanding about what is the end game, what is the U.S. trying to achieve, when will the Trump administration be happy, and enough is enough,” she said.
And while judging what will provoke U.S. escalations against Iran is not straightforward, she said, those escalations have come steadily enough as to seem almost inevitable.
“Action on the ground has been continuously punitive,” she said.
Brett McGurk, who until last year was the administration’s special envoy to the coalition against the Islamic State group, warned his former bosses, in an article for Foreign Affairs, that their maximalist demands had left “no plausible on-ramp for Iran to enter negotiations, since nobody, including the Iranians, knows what Iran is supposed to negotiate about.”
Kaye said Iran might conclude that it should tread with extreme caution. Or it might reason that the United States poses a threat that is both existential and unyielding, compelling Tehran to gamble on taking extreme measures.
“What I’m concerned about is that mixed signals, plus the perception of existential threat,” Kaye said, “might lead to dramatic steps that we might not have thought possible.”

Texto completo: Over high school lunch tables, teenagers spoke of World War III. When they got home, they tearfully asked their parents whether they would be drafted. Social media feeds exploded with predictions of military action and wisecracking memes about end times.
As the United States escalated its conflict with Iran this past week by killing Maj. Gen. Qassem Soleimani, a powerful Iranian commander, Americans scrambled to determine what it all meant for the young men and women whose lives could be upended in the event of an extended conflict.
For now, it remains too soon to tell. The United States’ wars in the Middle East have slogged on, with plenty of tense and foreboding moments, for about as long as most teenagers have been alive. But for a generation of young people who were born after the attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, or were not old enough at the time to have grasped their impact, the events of the past week signified the most urgent — and perhaps alarming — military escalation in memory.
Adrian Flynn was born a month after the Sept. 11 attacks and he registered for the Selective Service shortly after he turned 18 in October, as all men between 18 and 25 are required to do.
But he and his friends at his Manhattan high school did not give much thought to the ramifications of registering until this past Friday, after a drone strike authorized by President Donald Trump killed Soleimani and prompted vows of retaliation from Iran.
“Now it’s like, what exactly did we sign up for?” said Flynn, a senior who was recently accepted to college.
In cafeterias across the country, young men speculate about being sent abroad, even though U.S. officials have said repeatedly that they do not want a war with Iran, and that reinstating a military draft will require congressional approval. At this point, registering for the Selective Service has little bearing on the likelihood of being conscripted.

When Molly Patterson picked up her 17-year-old daughter from school in a suburb of Detroit on Friday, she was stunned when her daughter immediately asked whether her boyfriend would be drafted. The next morning, Patterson discovered that her 14-year-old son had been up until 3 a.m.; he was feeling stressed after reading about the possibility of war and texting his uncle about whether he could be sent to fight.
Patterson had not thought of the possibility of a draft, but her daughter said that it was all that people at school were talking about, and that many were even getting alerts on their phones with updates about the airstrike, more than 6,000 miles away. On Saturday, Patterson found herself trying to quell her children’s fears.
“We all talked about it this morning and I tried to relax them, saying there’s not going to be a war,” Patterson said on Saturday. “I like to be very, very honest with my children, but I don’t want them to worry about that. That’s for the adults right now. It’s too much for a kid to handle.”
Some young adults joined thousands of anti-war protesters on Saturday at more than 80 demonstrations to condemn the strike in Baghdad that killed Soleimani.
At one protest in Seattle, Lukas Illa, 19, said he was not too worried about being drafted, but was concerned about the effect a war would have on others, including service personnel who might come from disadvantaged backgrounds. He also said civilians in Iran were more at risk than Americans.
“We’re not going to be affected by this as much as Iranians will be,” Illa said.
Citlali Perez, 18, of Chicago, had begun to plan how she might mobilize against another protracted war, were it to come to that.
“Mostly how I feel is scared, but also wanting to do something about it and wanting to prevent it,” said Perez, a freshman at DePaul University who has become involved in anti-war activism.
Perez said she had seen a mix of fear and galvanization since news of the attacks. She has also seen the memes that have been widely shared online, making jokes about the draft or a hypothetical world war. Some found the posts distasteful, trivializing what had already become a deadly conflict, while others saw them as a way to laugh off their fear. In any case, the rapid spread of the memes was a clear sign of how preoccupied young people were with the airstrike and the looming question of what would come next.
For most, being shipped off to war is still a theoretical peril — a nerve-racking thought perhaps, but not an imminent threat. But for some young men and women, it was now a reality; at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, 3,500 troops were ordered to the Middle East in one of the largest rapid deployments in years.
Dia Smith, 21, was nervous for her wife, who is in the Army, even before the airstrike: Her wife was told on New Year’s Day that she would be deploying to Iraq. The rising political tensions since then have only made Smith’s fears worse.
Smith said her grandfather had served in the military and had come back so mentally scarred that she and her family found it difficult to visit him. She could not help but worry that if the conflict escalated, her friends — or even her wife — could return the same way.
“Growing up as a kid, you hear about the Vietnam War and all these things that are so surreal to me, until you’re in a time or space when you’re like, ‘This is real,’” Smith said from Fort Bragg. “Being my age, I can see how this can really shape or form the rest of my life, simply because she’s there.”
Smith is a member of the National Guard and said she had joined to get away from Montgomery, Alabama, where she went to high school. She runs a wig business and attends training on the base each month. She had wondered in recent days whether the National Guard could be deployed next.
“I’m waiting on that call for myself, hoping that it doesn’t come,” she said.

Texto completo: Reasonable people will debate the likeliest ramifications of President Donald Trump’s decision to order the killing of Maj. Gen. Qassem Soleimani, the Revolutionary Guard commander whose power in Iran was second only to that of the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei — and whose power in Lebanon, Syria and Iraq was arguably second to none.
What shouldn’t be in doubt is the justice.
By far the best account of Soleimani’s life was written by Dexter Filkins for The New Yorker in 2013. It’s worth reprising some of the details.
In 1998, Soleimani assumed command of the Quds Force — the Guard’s extraterritorial terrorist wing — whose prior exploits included a role in the bombing of a Jewish community center in Buenos Aires that killed 85 people.
In 2003, Filkins wrote, “Americans received intelligence that al-Qaida fighters in Iran,” operating with Tehran’s protection and consent, “were preparing an attack on Western targets in Saudi Arabia.” Despite U.S. warnings to Iran, terrorists “bombed three residential compounds in Riyadh, killing 35 people, including 9 Americans.”
In 2004, Soleimani “began flooding Iraq with lethal roadside bombs” known as explosively formed projectiles, which, according to retired Gen. Stanley McChrystal, “killed hundreds of Americans.”
In 2005, the former Lebanese prime minister, Rafik Hariri, and 21 others were killed in a massive car bombing in Beirut, carried out by Hezbollah. “There were Iranians on the phones directing the attack,” one former CIA official told Filkins. “If indeed Iran was involved, Soleimani was undoubtedly at the center of this.”
In 2006, Hezbollah operatives abducted and killed Israeli soldiers in an operation that, according to Filkins, was “carried out with Soleimani’s help.” It sparked a monthlong war in which thousands of people were killed.
There’s a great deal more of this. And that was just the preamble to his central role in rescuing Syria’s Bashar Assad and sustaining Yemen’s Houthi militia in power, goals pursued through policies of unrestricted brutality. As an agent of international mayhem, Soleimani’s peers were Osama bin Laden and Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. To think of him as a worthy adversary — an Iranian Erwin Rommel — is wrong. He was an evil man who died as he had killed so many others.
The proximate reason for Soleimani’s killing, according to a Defense Department statement, is that he “was actively developing plans to attack American diplomats and service members in Iraq and throughout the region.” If so — and it hardly stretches credulity that he was — the strike was an act of preemption. No U.S. president, of any party, should ever convey to an enemy the impression it can plot attacks against Americans with impunity. To do otherwise is to invite worse.
Trump’s problem is that, until Thursday, that’s what he had done. For almost a year, an escalating series of Iranian attacks on U.S. and allied assets were met by a conspicuous failure to respond militarily. Trump also kept signaling his desire to withdraw U.S. forces from the region.
The result was to embolden the Iranians to hit harder. Instead of a calibrated cycle of escalation matched to a tacit sense of limits, the Iranians reached until they overreached. On Wednesday, Khamenei taunted Trump with the message that “there is no damn thing you can do.” The supreme leader is now a publicly humiliated man. That is enormously satisfying — and immensely dangerous. Rashness often springs from wounded pride.
One possible outcome is that a spooked Iranian leadership, already reeling from devastating sanctions and mass demonstrations, will prefer to tread lightly, at least for the time being. “Soleimani’s death could bring a sense of realism to the Islamic Republic’s thinking,” says Iranian American journalist Masih Alinejad. For 40 years, the regime has succeeded abroad because it’s been willing to play dirty games against generally feckless opponents. It may now take its time to reassess that view.
The alternative? Iran could mount a global campaign of terrorist strikes, deploying foreign proxies like Hezbollah for political deniability. It could try to take hostages at the American Embassy in Baghdad, much as it did at the embassy in Tehran in 1979. It could use its influence in Iraq to demand the expulsion of U.S. troops — “accomplishing in the wake of his death what Soleimani long tried to accomplish in life,” as Mark Dubowitz of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies observes. And it could accelerate its nuclear program, forcing Trump into a major military confrontation he has been eager to avoid, especially in an election year.
The next days will be decisive. The best course for the United States is to spell out clearly to Iran what the paths of escalation — and de-escalation — hold. On the de-escalatory side, a return to the status quo ante and a willingness to explore negotiations over the full range of Iran’s malign activities, including its regional aggression and expanding nuclear program, in exchange for the easing of oil and other economic sanctions. On the escalatory side, a policy of deliberately disproportionate retaliation to any Iranian aggression, no matter whether it’s carried out by Iran or its proxies, and no matter whether it aims at us or our allies.
The clearer we are in limning the courses of hope and fear, the likelier we are to achieve a stable balance between them.

Texto completo: Irán ha anunciado este domingo, a través de la televisión estatal, su retirada del acuerdo internacional que limitaba su programa nuclear, achacando su decisión al asesinato el jueves de su principal general en un bombardeo estadounidense.
El presidente estadounidense, Donald Trump , ya se había retirado unilateralmente del acuerdo en mayo de 2018. Aún así, el tratado, firmado en julio de 2015 por su predecesor, Barack Obama , seguía siendo respaldado por Rusia, China y la Unión Europea.
Irán había accedido a restringir su producción nuclear por 10 años, cerrando miles de centrifugadoras de uranio, y se había comprometido a, “bajo ninguna circunstancia, buscar, desarrollar o adquirir cualquier arma nuclear ”. A cambio, se le levantaron sanciones comerciales valoradas en miles de millones de dólares.
¿Tiene Irán la bomba atómica ya? No.
¿Cuánto tardaría en desarrollarla ahora que ha abandonado el acuerdo nuclear?
Irán tenía más de 10,000 kilogramos (22,000 libras) de uranio poco enriquecido antes de firmar el acuerdo, según el experto Joe Cirincione. Este producto contiene menos del 20% del isótopo uranio-235, y se usa en reactores nucleares para producir energía . Merced al acuerdo, tuvo que deshacerse del 98% de sus reservas, quedándose sólo con 300 kilogramos (660 libras).
Son necesarios 1,050 kilogramos para construir una bomba atómica , pero antes deben ser tratados en centrifugadoras hasta convertirse en 25 kilogramos de uranio enriquecido (con al menos un 90% del mencionado isótopo). Antes el acuerdo, Irán tenía 19,000 centrifugadoras, según Cirincione, pero ahora sólo le quedaban entre 3,000 y 4,000 activas.
Expertos mencionados por la revista Newsweek y el diario The Wall Street Journal afirman que Irán necesitaría un año para poder fabricar uranio enriquecido suficiente para una bomba atómica. Aunque también podría comprarlo, lo que reduciría el plazo a tres meses , según el diario The New York Times.
Después aún tendría que colocar esa bomba en un misil balístico, lo que podría llevarle otro año. Corea del Norte , por ejemplo, tiene entre 20 y 60 bombas atómicas, y asegura poder montarlas en misiles intercontinentales con capaces de alcanzar Estados Unidos, aunque no parece claro que esto último sea cierto.
En el caso de Irán, todos los plazos están supeditados además a que Estados Unidos o Israel no actúen militarmente o de forma encubierta para sabotear sus instalaciones, como parece haber ocurrido en el pasado.
Israel posee la bomba atómica, y Arabia Saudí parece encaminada a tenerla; los tres países son enemigos entre sí.
En total, hay casi 14,000 artefactos nucleares en todo el mundo, pero están bajo control de sólo nueve países: Estados Unidos y Rusia acumulan casi 13,000, y el resto los tienen Reino Unido , Francia , China , India , Pakistán , Corea del Norte e Israel .
¿Qué efecto tendría la explosión de una bomba atómica en Estados Unidos?
“He estudiado las armas nucleares durante mucho tiempo, pero siempre encuentro difícil hacerme a la idea de su tamaño y sus efectos”, ha explicado el historiador Alex Wellerstein.
Para “ayudar a la gente, incluido yo mismo, a darse cuenta más o menos de las consecuencias, más allá del escenario extremo del fin del mundo que la mayoría tiene en la cabeza”, ha desarrollado una herramienta que calcula el radio de destrucción y las víctimas mortales de una explosión nuclear en Estados Unidos.
Haga la prueba: elija su ciudad, introduzca la potencia de la bomba, y presione el botón de Detonar para obtener el cálculo de muertos y heridos.
Un kilotón equivale a cuatro billones la potencia del explosivo trinitrotolueno (TNT), usado en la I y la II Guerra Mundial. La bomba atómica que Estados Unidos lanzó sobre la ciudad japonesa de Hiroshima tenía 15 kilotones; la de Nagasaki , 20 kilotones. Una bomba de hidrógeno puede llegar a 10,000 kilotones.
En Nueva York , una bomba de 150 kilotones mataría hasta 730,000 personas y causaría heridas a 1.5 millones. Borraría del mapa la mitad de la isla de Manhattan . En Los Ángeles , acabaría con 240,000 personas y heriría a 630,000 más. En Washington DC , habría 260.000 muertos y 440,000 heridos.

Texto completo: Irán ha anunciado este domingo, a través de la televisión estatal, su retirada del acuerdo internacional que limitaba su programa nuclear, achacando su decisión al asesinato el jueves de su principal general en un bombardeo estadounidense.
El presidente estadounidense, Donald Trump , ya se había retirado unilateralmente del acuerdo en mayo de 2018. Aún así, el tratado, firmado en julio de 2015 por su predecesor, Barack Obama , seguía siendo respaldado por Rusia, China y la Unión Europea.
Irán había accedido a restringir su producción nuclear por 10 años, cerrando miles de centrifugadoras de uranio, y se había comprometido a, “bajo ninguna circunstancia, buscar, desarrollar o adquirir cualquier arma nuclear ”. A cambio, se le levantaron sanciones comerciales valoradas en miles de millones de dólares.
¿Tiene Irán la bomba atómica ya? No.
¿Cuánto tardaría en desarrollarla ahora que ha abandonado el acuerdo nuclear?
Irán tenía más de 10,000 kilogramos (22,000 libras) de uranio poco enriquecido antes de firmar el acuerdo, según el experto Joe Cirincione. Este producto contiene menos del 20% del isótopo uranio-235, y se usa en reactores nucleares para producir energía . Merced al acuerdo, tuvo que deshacerse del 98% de sus reservas, quedándose sólo con 300 kilogramos (660 libras).
Son necesarios 1,050 kilogramos para construir una bomba atómica , pero antes deben ser tratados en centrifugadoras hasta convertirse en 25 kilogramos de uranio enriquecido (con al menos un 90% del mencionado isótopo). Antes el acuerdo, Irán tenía 19,000 centrifugadoras, según Cirincione, pero ahora sólo le quedaban entre 3,000 y 4,000 activas.
Expertos mencionados por la revista Newsweek y el diario The Wall Street Journal afirman que Irán necesitaría un año para poder fabricar uranio enriquecido suficiente para una bomba atómica. Aunque también podría comprarlo, lo que reduciría el plazo a tres meses , según el diario The New York Times.
Después aún tendría que colocar esa bomba en un misil balístico, lo que podría llevarle otro año. Corea del Norte , por ejemplo, tiene entre 20 y 60 bombas atómicas, y asegura poder montarlas en misiles intercontinentales con capaces de alcanzar Estados Unidos, aunque no parece claro que esto último sea cierto.
En el caso de Irán, todos los plazos están supeditados además a que Estados Unidos o Israel no actúen militarmente o de forma encubierta para sabotear sus instalaciones, como parece haber ocurrido en el pasado.
Israel posee la bomba atómica, y Arabia Saudí parece encaminada a tenerla; los tres países son enemigos entre sí.
En total, hay casi 14,000 artefactos nucleares en todo el mundo, pero están bajo control de sólo nueve países: Estados Unidos y Rusia acumulan casi 13,000, y el resto los tienen Reino Unido , Francia , China , India , Pakistán , Corea del Norte e Israel .
¿Qué efecto tendría la explosión de una bomba atómica en Estados Unidos?
“He estudiado las armas nucleares durante mucho tiempo, pero siempre encuentro difícil hacerme a la idea de su tamaño y sus efectos”, ha explicado el historiador Alex Wellerstein.
Para “ayudar a la gente, incluido yo mismo, a darse cuenta más o menos de las consecuencias, más allá del escenario extremo del fin del mundo que la mayoría tiene en la cabeza”, ha desarrollado una herramienta que calcula el radio de destrucción y las víctimas mortales de una explosión nuclear en Estados Unidos.
Haga la prueba: elija su ciudad, introduzca la potencia de la bomba, y presione el botón de Detonar para obtener el cálculo de muertos y heridos.
Un kilotón equivale a cuatro billones la potencia del explosivo trinitrotolueno (TNT), usado en la I y la II Guerra Mundial. La bomba atómica que Estados Unidos lanzó sobre la ciudad japonesa de Hiroshima tenía 15 kilotones; la de Nagasaki , 20 kilotones. Una bomba de hidrógeno puede llegar a 10,000 kilotones.
En Nueva York , una bomba de 150 kilotones mataría hasta 730,000 personas y causaría heridas a 1.5 millones. Borraría del mapa la mitad de la isla de Manhattan . En Los Ángeles , acabaría con 240,000 personas y heriría a 630,000 más. En Washington DC , habría 260.000 muertos y 440,000 heridos.

Texto completo: The Book of Science and Antiquities
By Thomas Keneally. (Atria, 289 pages, $28.)
Australian writer Thomas Keneally can be a hard sell. Brilliant, visionary and astoundingly prolific, he has written such bestsellers as "Schindler's List" and "The Daughters of Mars," as well as more than 40 other books, mostly novels, that showcase his mastery of modern science and world history and his richly layered, character-driven storytelling.
But reading Keneally requires the kind of respect and attention one often associates with classic novels of yesteryear. His stories are dense and complex. I have devoured some of them in a couple of sittings only to be told by friends that they couldn't make it through the first chapter. Keneally's latest novel, inexplicably burdened with the off-point title "The Book of Science and Antiquities," will not be a big hit, but if you like Keneally, you'll love it. It's a set of paired narratives -- the first focused on Shelby Apple, an aging Australian filmmaker who becomes fascinated by Learned Man, a 40,000-year-old set of bones found in the Australian Outback, and the second told by Learned Man himself.
Both protagonists have led long lives, rich in adventure, tragedy and respectable doses of the pride and foolishness built into the human condition. Both tell their stories in the shadow of looming death, which lends their narratives extra-poignant intensity. "All mothers want their issue to get along," Shelby observes. "All mothers have a uterine yearning for peace. But their children are quickly sundered from each other by mere concepts such as nation, ideology, culture."
Each of us is one of a kind, an unprecedented individual, and yet we are nothing, or very little, without community. That was true for ancient Learned Man and for modern Shelby. This is a rich and suspenseful read and a fine addition to Keneally's unmatched exploration via fiction of what it means to be human.

The Seine: The River That Made Paris By Elaine Sciolino. (W.W. Norton & Co., 370 pages, $26.95.)
Tourists usually look up from the boats in Paris that carry them along the Seine, admiring Notre Dame Cathedral, the Eiffel Tower and the magnificent bridges. But if we looked down at the water, we would start to appreciate the source of all the grandeur above. "Without the Eiffel Tower, Paris would still exist; without the Seine, there never would have been a Paris," writes Elaine Sciolino, a longtime American in Paris.
Sciolino stumbled into Paris decades ago as a divorced young journalist with feeble French. She thanks the Seine for keeping her grounded as she rebuilt her life. But as the years passed, she came to realize that she knew very little about "the most romantic river in the world," outside its 8 miles in the city. The former Paris bureau chief for the New York Times set about fixing that, in the way of a journalist "seduced by a river." She takes us along in an engaging travelogue/memoir tracing the Seine's 483 miles from its source to the sea.
She squelches in the Seine where it bubbles to the surface near an ancient temple in Burgundy. She swims in it after it becomes a river (but before it becomes polluted). She cruises it with police and river pilots, and commiserates with frustrated preservationists.
Readers will enjoy Sciolino's expansive take on the Seine's role in the history and culture of France, from the Romans to current filmmakers. We also learn some useful things: The river is a woman -- "La Seine" -- and she is pronounced SEN, not SANE.
It's fitting that just before publication, Sciolino had time to update the book after an April 2019 fire set Notre Dame ablaze. As the world watched firefighters battling the flames, how many knew that half the water was being pumped from the Seine? If not for the river, the centuries-old cathedral could have been lost. Instead it was saved, as are many humans when they reach out to the Seine.

Democrats Still Raise Hands for Radical Plans; Warren wins endorsement of world's insurer; media slow to understand 'public option'.

Texto completo: Former presidential candidate and Obama Administration housing secretary Julián Castro has endorsed Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts for President. And for some reason she seems grateful.
During his brief White House run Mr. Castro never caught on with voters but successfully encouraged many of his Democratic rivals to adopt untenable positions on health care and immigration.
Over the course of several months Mr. Castro backed government-run, taxpayer-funded health insurance, argued that such coverage should be extended to illegal immigrants, and also urged the decriminalization of illegal border crossings. Taken together, the Castro agenda items all but invite more than 7 billion people in the world to consider migrating to accept a free insurance plan courtesy of the American taxpayer.
Regardless of one's views on immigration or health care, simple math renders the Castro plan preposterous. Just since Mr. Castro was talking it up last year, the mere increase in the world's population may have exceeded the entire current U.S. population of Medicare patients.
But if the candidates at last June's Democratic presidential debates were great at math, they probably wouldn't have gone into politics. So many hands went up when moderators asked about insurance coverage for illegal immigrants and the decriminalization of illegal border crossings that some Democrats went searching for a way to avoid future embarrassments. CNN subsequently announced that at upcoming debates, "There will be no show of hands or one-word, down-the-line questions."
It's sweet that Sen. Warren has forgiven Mr. Castro, but it's still a surprise. That's because Ms. Warren has lately been paying an especially high political price for her early embrace of radical and expensive health policy—and she knows it.
Astead Herndon reported recently in the New York Times:
In warm-up remarks introducing Senator Elizabeth Warren at campaign rallies, young volunteers often say they are supporting her because of her plan to transform the health care system through a single-payer "Medicare for all" program. It happened in Des Moines on Saturday and Oklahoma City last week, and in western Iowa cities like Clarinda and Council Bluffs on Sunday.
But Ms. Warren herself is barely speaking of the proposal. After months of attacks from other candidates, and questions and some blowback from both liberals and moderates, the most ambitious and expensive of Ms. Warren's many plans — and the one most likely to transform the lives of voters — is just a passing mention in her standard stump speech, rarely explored in depth unless a questioner brings it up.
As the campaign grinds on, even Democrats who have backed seemingly less radical health plans may also become shy about discussing them. More than a decade after the world's greatest editorial writer and his Journal colleagues were warning that "public option" health plans quickly lead to entirely government-run medicine, word is starting to get around.
Eric Levitz wrote recently in New York magazine that presidential candidates like former Vice President Joe Biden and South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg haven't disclosed to voters the full impact of creating a new government competitor to private insurance:
Biden and Buttigieg haven't filled in the fine details of their public options. But both suggest that their plans would be comprehensive, less expensive than comparable private plans, and available to all Americans. As the former vice-president puts it, "Whether you're covered through your employer, buying your insurance on your own, or going without coverage altogether, the Biden Plan will give you the choice to purchase a public health insurance option like Medicare," and, "As in Medicare, the Biden public option will reduce costs for patients by negotiating lower prices from hospitals and other health care providers."
If this is an accurate description of Biden's plan, then Biden's plan will not allow most Americans to "keep their private insurance," at least, not for long. Private firms will never have as much pricing power as the federal government, nor as much capacity to provide coverage at a loss. If Uncle Sam uses his singular market power to force down costs — and doles out sufficient subsidies to make his "public option" universally affordable — then the private insurance industry as we've known it will cease to exist. Meanwhile, to make the provider payment cuts sustainable, America's approach to financing hospitals and medical schools would need to be radically restructured. And to make the public option fiscally sustainable — once the vast majority of Americans have enrolled in it — President Biden would need to propose tax increases nearly as large as those put forward by Sanders and Warren.
***
Please Stop Holding Your Applause
Whether Mr. Biden chooses to discuss health care or not, he seems to be facing a recurring challenge at campaign events. Walter Shapiro writes in the New Republic:
Speaking to about 130 people at a late November town meeting in rural Knoxville, Iowa, 40 miles southeast of Des Moines, Biden gave an 11-minute stump speech without a single burst of applause until he finished. Then for the first 20 minutes of the question period, Biden spoke to the sound of no hands clapping. It was hard not to recall the plea of Jeb Bush—another thoroughbred hopeful in the crowded 2016 GOP field: Please clap. Amid all the many polling surprises, debate bumps, and unanticipated reversals of the 2020 Democratic campaign, there has been an unalterable truth: You never have to worry about finding parking at a Joe Biden event.

Texto completo: LOS ANGELES (AP) - Harvey Weinstein has been indicted on new sex crime charges in Los Angeles, just as his trial on separate rape and sexual assault charges in New York was poised to get underway, prosecutors announced Monday.
The Hollywood mogul has been charged with raping one woman and sexually assaulting another in separate incidents over a two-day period in 2013, Los Angeles County District Attorney Jackie Lacey said in a news release.
“We believe the evidence will show that the defendant used his power and influence to gain access to his victims and then commit violent crimes against them,” Lacey said in a statement. “I want to commend the victims who have come forward and bravely recounted what happened to them. It is my hope that all victims of sexual violence find strength and healing as they move forward.”
Weinstein is accused of raping a woman in a hotel room on Feb. 18, 2013, after pushing his way inside her room, prosecutors said. The next night, he allegedly sexually assaulted a woman in a Beverly Hills hotel suite. Those events came days before he was photographed on the Oscars red carpet with his fashion designer wife, Georgina Chapman, who was pregnant at the time.
The charges announced Monday took more than two years to file because the women were reluctant to provide all the information necessary, according to Lacey. The Los Angeles district attorney’s task force is still investigating sex crime allegations against Weinstein from three women. Prosecutors declined charges involving three other women because their cases were beyond the statute of limitations.
Weinstein faces up to 28 years in state prison if he is convicted of the charges filed in L.A.: forcible rape, forcible oral copulation, sexual penetration by use of force and sexual battery by restraint. His arraignment has not yet been scheduled and prosecutors will recommend $5 million bail. Weinstein is expected to appear in court in California after his trial in New York is finished, Lacey said.
Lawyers for Weinstein had no immediate response to the new charges.
Lacey said there was no relationship between the timing of the New York trial and the filing of charges in Los Angeles. She said the filing and announcement came on the first business day all the necessary people could be gathered for the charges and announcement.
But that meant the dramatic announcement came the same day that Weinstein and several of the women who have accused him of sexual misconduct converged Monday at the New York City courthouse where a judge and his lawyers handled the final preparations for his high-stakes trial on charges of rape and assault.
Speaking at the New York courthouse Monday prior to the announcement, Weinstein’s attorneys suggested they knew charges might be coming. They asked the judge for potential jurors to be sequestered partly because of the possibility that charges could be brought elsewhere against Weinstein while the trial was ongoing. The denied that request.
“There is a potential L.A. situation going on,” his lawyer, Donna Rotunno, told reporters after the hearing.
“We don’t know what is going to happen. We’re hoping not,” added another of his lawyers, Damon Cheronis. “We have no control over what happens in Los Angeles or anywhere else.”
Earlier Monday, Weinstein, 67, entered the courthouse in New York leaning on a walker following a recent back surgery. When asked outside the courtroom how his back felt, Weinstein responded with a thin smile and a so-so gesture with his hand.
“Not so good,” he said. “Better.”
Inside, his lawyers and prosecutors spent the morning sparring about procedural matters, including how to keep publicity surrounding the trial from influencing the jury's thinking.
In a brief hearing, the judge declined to gag Weinstein's attorneys from speaking to the media - in addition to denying the motion to sequester jurors. The judge also turned down a defense request to call as a witness a police detective who had been accused of mishandling part of the case.
Across the street, actresses and other women who say they were sexually harassed or assaulted by Weinstein dismissed him as a villain undeserving of anyone's pity.
“He looked cowardly. He wouldn’t look at us. He wouldn’t make eye contact,” said Sarah Ann Masse, a performer and writer who said Weinstein once sexually harassed her in his underwear during a job interview. "This trial is a cultural reckoning regardless of its legal outcome," she said.
Jury selection in the trial will start Tuesday, more than two years since the allegations first came to widespread public attention and catalyzed the #MeToo movement.
Weinstein's lead lawyer, Donna Rotunno, said she was hopeful a fair jury could be found that wouldn't pre-judge the case.
“In this great country, you are innocent until proven guilty,” she told reporters outside the courthouse.
Weinstein faces allegations that he raped one woman in a Manhattan hotel room in 2013 and performed a forcible sex act on a woman, Mimi Haleyi, who had come to him seeking film work in 2006.
He has pleaded not guilty and says any sexual activity was consensual. If he's convicted of the most serious charges against him, two counts of predatory sexual assault, Weinstein faces a mandatory life sentence.
For that to happen, prosecutors must demonstrate Weinstein had a habit of violating women, beyond the two directly involved in the encounters in which he's charged. To that end, they plan to call actress Annabella Sciorra, who says Weinstein forced himself inside her Manhattan apartment in 1993 or 1994 and raped her after she starred in a film for his movie studio. One of the accusers in the Los Angeles case is also expected to testify.
Prosecutors wanted jurors to hear from a few of the more than 75 women who have come forward publicly to accuse Weinstein of sexual misconduct ranging from harassment to assault. The first allegations were brought to light by The New York Times and The New Yorker in October 2017.
Prosecutors got permission from the court to try to buttress their case with four other witnesses: Sciorra and three other accusers who haven't been named.
One of those women said she had an encounter with Weinstein at a Manhattan hotel in 2004. A second was to testify about an interaction with Weinstein at a SoHo apartment in 2005. A third was described in court papers as having had an incident with Weinstein at a hotel in Beverly Hills, California, in February 2013.
Speaking outside the courthouse as proceedings began, a group of Weinstein's accusers spoke with reporters, including Masse, the actresses Rosanna Arquette, Dominique Huett and Rose McGowan, model Paula Williams, Louise Godbold and the actress and journalist Lauren Sivan.
McGowan thanked the women who will testify during the trial as alleged victims for representing many more women who may never get their day in court.
“They are standing for us, and I am immensely proud of them,” she said. “We didn’t have our day. But hopefully they will. Their victory will be our victory. Their loss will be our loss.”
Rotunno has argued the case is weak and said she plans to aggressively cross-examine the accusers.
In court on Monday, prosecutor Joan Illuzzi immediately set a combative tone by referring to Weinstein as a "predator," drawing an objection from the defense table.
The lawyers also clashed after prosecutors asked the judge to bar all attorneys in the trial from speaking about the evidence outside court. Illuzzi accused Rotunno of “degrading and humiliating and putting down our witnesses” in statements to the press leading up to the trial.
"I have not degraded anyone," Rotunno responded.
Judge James Burke refused to issue a gag order, but told both sides: “Leave the witnesses alone, OK? Don’t talk about them in any way.”

How Much Water Should You Really Drink?

Texto completo: Water is pretty boring, as far as beverages go. It doesn’t have a catchy jingle, a secret family recipe or even a taste, really. Yet people can’t seem to get enough of it.
“I get people in my office every day, every week, saying something like, ‘I’m concerned I’m not hydrated,’ ” said Lauren Antonucci, a nutritionist in New York City.
Their concerns may be based on conventional wisdom. One well-known recommendation suggests drinking eight glasses of water a day; another warns that if you feel thirsty, you’re already dehydrated.
But anxiety about water consumption could also stem from a different, more philosophical source: Hydration is now marketed as a cure for nearly all of life’s woes.
The answer to everything
Water, in recent years, has been imbued with the powers of a mysterious elixir. The latest “it” celebrity’s skin care secret? Oh, just water. Feeling sluggish? You probably need more water. Uninspired and utterly hopeless about your career and romantic prospects? Well, have you had any water today?
People hydrate as if their reputations depend on it. They dutifully carry water bottles with them wherever they go, draining and refilling them with gusto.
Some go so far as to track their consumption in a journal, or with a mobile app. Hydration is the mark of a well-adjusted, successful person. On Jan. 1, Twitter flooded with resolutions to drink more water, including from Twitter’s brand account.
But will more conscious hydration really make for a more productive 2020?
“There’s no evidence that a little bit of dehydration really impacts anybody’s performance,” Dr. Mitchell Rosner, a kidney specialist at the University of Virginia who studies overhydration in athletes, said in a phone interview.
He said that most recommendations for hydration come from studies of athletes, who lose fluid rapidly during workouts or competitions and are at a much higher risk for dehydration than the average person.
For those of us who spend all day at a desk, Rosner said, it’s best to drink only when we feel thirsty.
Overhydrating, he said, isn’t helping anyone. At best, Rosner said, “You pee it out.” At worst, it can cause the sodium and electrolyte levels in your body to drop to dangerously low levels. The condition, hyponatremia, can result in hospitalization and death. (This doesn’t happen often, but ... good to know.)
If hydration is the goal, it’s also worth considering that water may not be the most hydrating beverage out there. A study published in 2015, of 72 male subjects, found that full-fat milk, skim milk and orange juice kept people more hydrated than still water did.
So, could America be ready for a dairy revolution? Unlikely. That’s because water isn’t just a beverage preference that needs to be toppled. It’s a virtue.
How did we get here?
In 2017, bottled water surpassed soft drinks as the top beverage in the United States by volume, with sales up 7% over the previous year, according to the Beverage Marketing Corp., a consulting firm. Since then, sales have continued to rise.
“It’s no accident that it’s No. 1,” said Michael Bellas, chairman of Beverage Marketing Corp. “If you had to put together a perfect scenario and plan how to build a category, this would have been it.”
In the 1970s, ad campaigns by Evian and Perrier introduced the concept of bottled water as a high-end refreshment beverage, Bellas said. Before that, bottled water was sold as a tap water replacement.
These new campaigns helped enable bottled water to compete with other grocery store beverages, like juice, coffee, soda and beer.
By the early aughts, Bellas said, people weren’t just drinking bottled water while sitting down for a meal. They were drinking it all day. While consumers may have begun to curb their intake of caffeinated or sugary beverages, they had no reason to put a limit on zero-calorie, thirst-quenching water. And they were carrying it around with them, on the go.
“It changed the way beverages were consumed,” Bellas said. If people were drinking water everywhere, it could be sold anywhere. And it was. Bottled water’s indefinite shelf life and readily available product made its expansion seamless.
As single-use plastic water bottles proliferated, an environmentally conscious response emerged: reusable water bottles. Nalgene, which began as a plastic laboratory pipette maker before outdoorsy scientists realized they were perfect for camping, became an accessory for college students in the early aughts.
They could pick a Nalgene color that reflected their personality and then plaster it with stickers for whatever they cared about: the college radio station, student government, the Dave Matthews Band.
The rise of Nalgene coincided with Bellas’ observation that carrying bottled water took on a symbolic meaning during the early aughts.
“It was cool to carry a water bottle around,” he said. “And it was healthy. It made a statement.” Reusable water bottles made the same statement with an environmental twist.
In recent years, ever-growing environmental and health concerns have turned them into a gift-guide-worthy statement item. For the consumers with big budgets, there’s Yeti. For VSCO girls, there’s the Hydro Flask. Aesthetically discerning buyers may gravitate toward design-forward companies like Bkr or Hay.
Any of them make for a gift that says, “I love you, and I want you to be hydrated.”
What about all those health claims?
Water is a go-to remedy for a variety of ailments: exhaustion, headaches, digestive problems, inflammation, dry skin, acne.
“It’s a popular idea among patients and a popular idea in consumer media that hydration equals healthy skin,” said Joshua Zeigler, a dermatologist at Mount Sinai in New York City.
But that’s not exactly how it works. “It’s a complete myth that eight glasses of water are necessary to maintain hydrated skin,” he said. Still, many consumers treat water like an anti-aging potion.
We think of water as so good for us that the bottled water industry doesn’t need to spend much money on convincing us to buy it, compared with marketing budgets for other beverages.
Advertising expenditures in 2018 were $109 million for the bottled water industry, while the beer industry spent more than $1.5 billion, and the soft drink industry came close to $1 billion, according to data from Kantar Media.
The truth is that for the most part, consumers don’t care what brand of bottled water they buy; the best-selling brand of bottled water, according to the online statistics portal Statista, is “private label,” which is another term for “generic brand.” Consumers don’t even know who manufactured it, or where.
Water appears immune to claims that its benefits are overblown - we need it to survive, after all. Its benefits have even become a meme. There are social media accounts dedicated to berating their followers for not drinking enough water.
But if you haven’t quite hit your quota today, don’t worry: Your 2020 isn’t already ruined. The tasty beverages you thought of as dehydrating, like coffee, tea and beer, are actually hydrating.
“Coffee is a hydrating beverage,” said Antonucci, the nutritionist. “If you’re drinking it, let go of the guilt. Enjoy it.”

Texto completo: Corrections & clarifications: An earlier version of this story included incorrect information about which Puerto Rico landmarks were damaged; they were Punta Ventana in Guayanilla and Ruinas del Faro in Borinquen.
A popular tourist landmark in Puerto Rico, Punta Ventana, was destroyed in the Puerto Rico earthquakes Monday.
Additionally, the Puerto Rico Tourism Company confirmed in a statement to USA TODAY that Ruinas del Faro, also suffered irreparable damage.
A 5. 8-magnitude quake hit the Caribbean island before dawn Monday, unleashing small landslides, causing power outages and severely cracking homes. It was one of the strongest quakes yet to hit the U. S. territory, which has been hit by temblors for the past week.
There were no immediate reports of casualties.
The tourism company said no damage was reported in most other regions of the island.
The head of the organization encourages tourists and locals to stay calm and review their action plans in case of emergencies.
The beachside rock formation was located in the town of Guayanilla and was aptly named Punta Ventana (or "Window Point") as it resembled a stone window that looked out to a beautiful view of the ocean behind it.
According to The New York Times, Mayor Nelson Torres Yordán said "it finally fell" on Monday after the formation started to look vulnerable when smaller temblors began hitting the area a week earlier.
Denniza Colon, a 22-year-old resident of Guayanilla, told the Miami Herald that she was shocked when she saw the arch had vanished.
“This is really sad,” she told the outlet in a telephone interview. “It was one of the biggest tourism draws of Guayanilla. ”
A tourism draw, indeed. Some of the over 16,000 Instagram results for the hashtag #Guayanilla feature shots of Punta Ventana.
Side-by-side images of the destruction are also being shared around social media, though USA TODAY was unable to verify the photos' authenticity.
User @savingpuertorico shared a post along with the caption: "One of Puerto Rico’s iconic natural wonders — a soaring stone arch along the southern coast known as Punta Ventana or Window Point — collapsed early Monday"

Texto completo: Welcome to my annual review of the top news of a feather.
The 2019 birding year wasn’t boring, that’s for sure. Birds drew the national spotlight; drama and history played out on a Chicago beach; and a series of rare sightings sent local birders scrambling for their binoculars, scopes and car keys.
Like a dark cloud, one story overshadowed all the others. In September, the journal Science revealed that breeding bird populations in the U.S. and Canada are tanking — down 29 percent since 1970. About 3 billion fewer birds are in the air than 50 years ago. Researchers at seven institutions, including the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, co-authored the study.
Birders have long known certain species are in decline, some clearly inching toward extinction. But the magnitude of loss caught even the experts off guard, as did the news that so-called "common" birds such as blue jays and red-winged blackbirds are suffering, too.
Mainstream media jumped on it, owing that birds are an indicator of overall ecosystem health. "The mass disappearance of North American birds is a dire warning about the planet’s well-being," The New York Times said.
Study details, including reasons for the decline and "7 Simple Actions to Help Birds," are online at 3billionbirds.org.
Birds are resilient creatures, one of the reasons my glass remains half full. In fact, waterfowl and raptor populations are increasing thanks to effective conservation efforts.
Avian resiliency was on full display last summer at Montrose Beach along Lake Michigan. I suspect you’ve heard a thing or two about Monty and Rose, the first piping plovers to nest in Chicago since the mid-1950s. It was the local nature story of the year, rivaled only by an alligator in the Humboldt Park Lagoon.
Some 190 volunteers from the birding community devoted more than 1,200 hours to the Piping Plover Watch, monitoring and protecting the federally endangered birds for two months on the busy beach.
Their extraordinary efforts were rewarded by the birth and successful fledging of two piping plover chicks. The siblings began their southern migration in late August.
Gov. J.B. Pritzker declared Nov. 18 to be Piping Plover Day, coinciding with the debut of "Monty and Rose," a film directed by Bob Dolgan. The first showing at the Music Box Theatre sold out, as did subsequent screenings at other Chicago venues. Watch for viewing opportunities in the Western suburbs.
Ironically, the inspiring Montrose plover story played out during a year in which the Endangered Species Act came under attack by the Trump administration. The ESA, enacted in 1973, is generally heralded as a success by Republicans and Democrats alike. We now enjoy bald eagles around DuPage County because of it.
In October, Kirtland’s warbler exited the endangered species list, further evidence of ESA’s effectiveness in helping imperiled species rebound from near-extinction.
Odd and rare But enough politics. Head-scratching bird stories are more interesting, like the Georgia family that discovered a live screech owl in their Christmas tree days after they’d brought the tree inside and decorated it with lights and owl ornaments.
In Florida, a man raising exotic birds suffered death by cassowary. Also in the Sunshine State, a rare yellow cardinal visited a backyard feeder. A gynandromorphic cardinal — half male and half female — showed up in Erie, Pennsylvania.
Pennsylvania’s other avian shocker was a snail kite, spotted in October — the first U.S. sighting of the nonmigratory raptor outside of Florida, South Carolina or Texas. Where was it seen? In Erie, of course.
In Redding, California, a fledgling red-tailed hawk was observed in a bald eagle nest along with two eaglets, all three being cared for by two adult eagles. Shockingly, the eagles settled on raising the baby hawk instead of eating it.
Sadly, in June, a car struck and killed one of the beloved Mooseheart bald eagles in North Aurora. The surviving adult male assumed full-time parenting duties.
Woody Goss witnessed a cowbird chick being fed by common yellowthroats, a male and female — and then by a catbird! It happened at Morton Arboretum in Lisle.
Wild turkeys strutting around Chicago added further proof that when it comes to birds, you just never know.
Now let’s turn to the truly remarkable sightings of 2019 — the feathered wonders that local birders went out of their way to see and photograph.
In some cases, way out their way, such as Effingham County. That’s where a western beauty, Lewis’s woodpecker, visited feeders at the Ballard Nature Center in early May. The species was a first record for Illinois, and a lifer for many who ventured to see it.
On May 9, lucky watchers in Chicago witnessed both Kirtland’s warbler and western tanager in the same area of Grant Park. The Kirtland’s stayed for a week, and those who missed the western would have other chances. For whatever reason, 2019 was a phenomenal year for vagrant western tanagers in the Great Lakes region.
Jeff Smith discovered a male painted bunting at Midewin National Tallgrass Prairie in Will County on June 2. The Technicolor songbird seldom strays so far north.
Two other rarities, little stint and ruff, caused a rush to downstate Fulton County in early August. Even further south, sightings of fulvous whistling duck tempted birders in August (Jackson County) and September (Monroe).
The first confirmed Illinois record of limpkin, a large wader rarely spotted outside of Florida in the U.S., occurred near Olney in Richland County. Birders didn’t hear about it until September, but the bird was first noticed by local homeowners in June.
A Cassin’s kingbird at Montrose, discovered by Krzysztof Kurylowicz on Sept. 22 was a new species for the state’s No. 1 hot spot.
On a frigid Halloween, Tamima Itani scoped a king eider paddling around the Northwestern lagoon. The large sea duck was well seen on subsequent days in Evanston and Chicago.
The next mega-rarity, ancient murrelet, arrived eight days later at Montrose. First reported by Bob Hughes, it was all-time species No. 347 for the site, according to eBird.
Montrose, of course, home of the Magic Hedge, is a magnet for migratory birds. And with lots of watchers, rare sightings are almost routine. Highlights in 2019 (not already mentioned) included barred owl, black tern, black-bellied whistling duck, black vulture, common gallinule, long-billed curlew, purple sandpiper, Smith’s longspur, snowy egret, Townsend’s warbler and a flyby pair of whooping cranes. Insane!

Texto completo: Welcome to my annual review of the top news of a feather.
The 2019 birding year wasn’t boring, that’s for sure. Birds drew the national spotlight; drama and history played out on a Chicago beach; and a series of rare sightings sent local birders scrambling for their binoculars, scopes and car keys.
Like a dark cloud, one story overshadowed all the others. In September, the journal Science revealed that breeding bird populations in the U.S. and Canada are tanking — down 29 percent since 1970. About 3 billion fewer birds are in the air than 50 years ago. Researchers at seven institutions, including the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, co-authored the study.
Birders have long known certain species are in decline, some clearly inching toward extinction. But the magnitude of loss caught even the experts off guard, as did the news that so-called "common" birds such as blue jays and red-winged blackbirds are suffering, too.
Mainstream media jumped on it, owing that birds are an indicator of overall ecosystem health. "The mass disappearance of North American birds is a dire warning about the planet’s well-being," The New York Times said.
Study details, including reasons for the decline and "7 Simple Actions to Help Birds," are online at 3billionbirds.org.
Birds are resilient creatures, one of the reasons my glass remains half full. In fact, waterfowl and raptor populations are increasing thanks to effective conservation efforts.
Avian resiliency was on full display last summer at Montrose Beach along Lake Michigan. I suspect you’ve heard a thing or two about Monty and Rose, the first piping plovers to nest in Chicago since the mid-1950s. It was the local nature story of the year, rivaled only by an alligator in the Humboldt Park Lagoon.
Some 190 volunteers from the birding community devoted more than 1,200 hours to the Piping Plover Watch, monitoring and protecting the federally endangered birds for two months on the busy beach.
Their extraordinary efforts were rewarded by the birth and successful fledging of two piping plover chicks. The siblings began their southern migration in late August.
Gov. J.B. Pritzker declared Nov. 18 to be Piping Plover Day, coinciding with the debut of "Monty and Rose," a film directed by Bob Dolgan. The first showing at the Music Box Theatre sold out, as did subsequent screenings at other Chicago venues. Watch for viewing opportunities in the Western suburbs.
Ironically, the inspiring Montrose plover story played out during a year in which the Endangered Species Act came under attack by the Trump administration. The ESA, enacted in 1973, is generally heralded as a success by Republicans and Democrats alike. We now enjoy bald eagles around DuPage County because of it.
In October, Kirtland’s warbler exited the endangered species list, further evidence of ESA’s effectiveness in helping imperiled species rebound from near-extinction.
Odd and rare But enough politics. Head-scratching bird stories are more interesting, like the Georgia family that discovered a live screech owl in their Christmas tree days after they’d brought the tree inside and decorated it with lights and owl ornaments.

Texto completo: When you hear or see President Donald Trump attack the news media with claims of made-up sources, he puts newspaper editors at a disadvantage to prove him wrong.
You see a great deal of anonymously sourced stories in national papers such as The New York Times and Washington Post these days. They’re doing so more consistently today — under this president — than I remember seeing.
That’s not necessarily a bad thing. Many stories simply could not be reported unless those who have intimate knowledge of the goings-on in the White House are granted some level of anonymity.
President Donald Trump does not look kindly upon those who are disloyal to him, so there is a real fear of reprisal.
The use of anonymous sources is not a license to make things up. Editors at the Daily Herald must run the potential use of anonymous material up the flagpole, and it must meet my standards.
News outfits that use anonymous sources appropriately also provide some context to show you the person providing information is in a position to know something. Good news outlets make a concerted effort to substantiate what is being said.
At the Daily Herald, we adhere to principles laid out in the Society of Professional Journalists Code of Ethics.
Here are some relevant tenets: * Consider sources’ motives before promising anonymity. Reserve anonymity for sources who may face danger, retribution or other harm, and have information that cannot be obtained elsewhere.
* Explain why anonymity was granted.
The use of anonymous sources should always be a last resort. The more transparent we are about who is providing information, the greater trust you have in our work.

Texto completo: When you hear or see President Donald Trump attack the news media with claims of made-up sources, he puts newspaper editors at a disadvantage to prove him wrong.
You see a great deal of anonymously sourced stories in national papers such as The New York Times and Washington Post these days. They’re doing so more consistently today — under this president — than I remember seeing.
That’s not necessarily a bad thing. Many stories simply could not be reported unless those who have intimate knowledge of the goings-on in the White House are granted some level of anonymity.
President Donald Trump does not look kindly upon those who are disloyal to him, so there is a real fear of reprisal.
The use of anonymous sources is not a license to make things up. Editors at the Daily Herald must run the potential use of anonymous material up the flagpole, and it must meet my standards.
News outfits that use anonymous sources appropriately also provide some context to show you the person providing information is in a position to know something. Good news outlets make a concerted effort to substantiate what is being said.
At the Daily Herald, we adhere to principles laid out in the Society of Professional Journalists Code of Ethics.
Here are some relevant tenets: * Consider sources’ motives before promising anonymity. Reserve anonymity for sources who may face danger, retribution or other harm, and have information that cannot be obtained elsewhere.
* Explain why anonymity was granted.
The use of anonymous sources should always be a last resort. The more transparent we are about who is providing information, the greater trust you have in our work.

Texto completo: Welcome to my annual review of the top news of a feather.
The 2019 birding year wasn’t boring, that’s for sure. Birds drew the national spotlight; drama and history played out on a Chicago beach; and a series of rare sightings sent local birders scrambling for their binoculars, scopes and car keys.
Like a dark cloud, one story overshadowed all the others. In September, the journal Science revealed that breeding bird populations in the U.S. and Canada are tanking — down 29 percent since 1970. About 3 billion fewer birds are in the air than 50 years ago. Researchers at seven institutions, including the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, co-authored the study.
Birders have long known certain species are in decline, some clearly inching toward extinction. But the magnitude of loss caught even the experts off guard, as did the news that so-called "common" birds such as blue jays and red-winged blackbirds are suffering, too.
Mainstream media jumped on it, owing that birds are an indicator of overall ecosystem health. "The mass disappearance of North American birds is a dire warning about the planet’s well-being," The New York Times said.
Study details, including reasons for the decline and "7 Simple Actions to Help Birds," are online at 3billionbirds.org.
Birds are resilient creatures, one of the reasons my glass remains half full. In fact, waterfowl and raptor populations are increasing thanks to effective conservation efforts.
Avian resiliency was on full display last summer at Montrose Beach along Lake Michigan. I suspect you’ve heard a thing or two about Monty and Rose, the first piping plovers to nest in Chicago since the mid-1950s. It was the local nature story of the year, rivaled only by an alligator in the Humboldt Park Lagoon.
Some 190 volunteers from the birding community devoted more than 1,200 hours to the Piping Plover Watch, monitoring and protecting the federally endangered birds for two months on the busy beach.
Their extraordinary efforts were rewarded by the birth and successful fledging of two piping plover chicks. The siblings began their southern migration in late August.
Gov. J.B. Pritzker declared Nov. 18 to be Piping Plover Day, coinciding with the debut of "Monty and Rose," a film directed by Bob Dolgan. The first showing at the Music Box Theatre sold out, as did subsequent screenings at other Chicago venues. Watch for viewing opportunities in the Western suburbs.
Ironically, the inspiring Montrose plover story played out during a year in which the Endangered Species Act came under attack by the Trump administration. The ESA, enacted in 1973, is generally heralded as a success by Republicans and Democrats alike. We now enjoy bald eagles around DuPage County because of it.
In October, Kirtland’s warbler exited the endangered species list, further evidence of ESA’s effectiveness in helping imperiled species rebound from near-extinction.
Odd and rare But enough politics. Head-scratching bird stories are more interesting, like the Georgia family that discovered a live screech owl in their Christmas tree days after they’d brought the tree inside and decorated it with lights and owl ornaments.
In Florida, a man raising exotic birds suffered death by cassowary. Also in the Sunshine State, a rare yellow cardinal visited a backyard feeder. A gynandromorphic cardinal — half male and half female — showed up in Erie, Pennsylvania.
Pennsylvania’s other avian shocker was a snail kite, spotted in October — the first U.S. sighting of the nonmigratory raptor outside of Florida, South Carolina or Texas. Where was it seen? In Erie, of course.
In Redding, California, a fledgling red-tailed hawk was observed in a bald eagle nest along with two eaglets, all three being cared for by two adult eagles. Shockingly, the eagles settled on raising the baby hawk instead of eating it.
Sadly, in June, a car struck and killed one of the beloved Mooseheart bald eagles in North Aurora. The surviving adult male assumed full-time parenting duties.
Woody Goss witnessed a cowbird chick being fed by common yellowthroats, a male and female — and then by a catbird! It happened at Morton Arboretum in Lisle.
Wild turkeys strutting around Chicago added further proof that when it comes to birds, you just never know.
Now let’s turn to the truly remarkable sightings of 2019 — the feathered wonders that local birders went out of their way to see and photograph.
In some cases, way out their way, such as Effingham County. That’s where a western beauty, Lewis’s woodpecker, visited feeders at the Ballard Nature Center in early May. The species was a first record for Illinois, and a lifer for many who ventured to see it.
On May 9, lucky watchers in Chicago witnessed both Kirtland’s warbler and western tanager in the same area of Grant Park. The Kirtland’s stayed for a week, and those who missed the western would have other chances. For whatever reason, 2019 was a phenomenal year for vagrant western tanagers in the Great Lakes region.
Jeff Smith discovered a male painted bunting at Midewin National Tallgrass Prairie in Will County on June 2. The Technicolor songbird seldom strays so far north.
Two other rarities, little stint and ruff, caused a rush to downstate Fulton County in early August. Even further south, sightings of fulvous whistling duck tempted birders in August (Jackson County) and September (Monroe).
The first confirmed Illinois record of limpkin, a large wader rarely spotted outside of Florida in the U.S., occurred near Olney in Richland County. Birders didn’t hear about it until September, but the bird was first noticed by local homeowners in June.
A Cassin’s kingbird at Montrose, discovered by Krzysztof Kurylowicz on Sept. 22 was a new species for the state’s No. 1 hot spot.
On a frigid Halloween, Tamima Itani scoped a king eider paddling around the Northwestern lagoon. The large sea duck was well seen on subsequent days in Evanston and Chicago.
The next mega-rarity, ancient murrelet, arrived eight days later at Montrose. First reported by Bob Hughes, it was all-time species No. 347 for the site, according to eBird.
Montrose, of course, home of the Magic Hedge, is a magnet for migratory birds. And with lots of watchers, rare sightings are almost routine. Highlights in 2019 (not already mentioned) included barred owl, black tern, black-bellied whistling duck, black vulture, common gallinule, long-billed curlew, purple sandpiper, Smith’s longspur, snowy egret, Townsend’s warbler and a flyby pair of whooping cranes. Insane!

Texto completo: The Trump administration is dismantling the entire concept of science-based policy-making with the fervor of Galileo's tribunal. Instead of the religious dogma invoked to persecute Galileo, today's dogma is the protection of industrial and commercial interests at all costs.
The administration has punished government scientists for the heresy of putting science ahead of partisan ideology. The war on science now underway in Washington springs from an unholy alliance between President Donald Trump -- a global-warming denier and vaccine skeptic -- and his adopted Republican Party. Together they are unwinding environmental progress to advance industrial interests and build a dirtier, more hazardous, more ignorant world in which science is subservient to profits, ideological purity and feeding Trump's ego.
Consider the government map amateurishly altered with a Sharpie to support Trump's misstatement that Hurricane Dorian threatened Alabama. A president who respects facts and has a modicum of humility would have simply admitted the minor mistake and moved on. But Trump's insistence on having his mistake validated reportedly moved Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross to threaten the firing of government weather scientists who refused to lie publicly about the hurricane's projected path.
Most other examples aren't so comically bumbling. Trump moved quickly after inauguration to pull the U.S. out of the Paris climate agreement. The administration systematically placed scientific and environmental priorities under the control of former lobbyists previously paid to undermine those priorities.
These aren't merely indications of an indifference to responsible science but rather overt contempt for it.
Among the administration's anti-science lowlights, as reported in an exhaustive recent piece in The New York Times and elsewhere:
- The administration has steadily decimated scientific programs meant to provide data on environmental, economic and climate issues. It closed a key office that provided research on the economic effects of natural disasters and ended funding for 22 research centers that had addressed habitat loss and wildlife management.
- Environmental Protection Agency political appointees have overruled agency experts on topics including asbestos regulation, pesticides and smog standards, according to internal documents cited by the Times.
- After testifying to Congress about how global warming could affect America's parks, National Park Service scientist Patrick Gonzalez received a warning letter from his superiors. "I saw it as attempted intimidation," Gonzalez told the Times. "It's interference with science and hinders our work."
- Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue ordered two research agencies, employing nearly 600 people, to relocate from Washington to Kansas City. More than half quit rather than uproot their families. Then-Budget Director Mick Mulvaney publicly called the move a "wonderful way" to get rid of hard-to-fire federal workers.
- The administration canceled a $1 million study on the effects of "mountaintop removal," an especially devastating form of coal mining. It yanked funding for health centers that studied the effects of pollution on children's development.
EPA staffing is at its lowest level in a decade due to departures of researchers and hiring freezes. EPA is rolling back environmental standards on issues like wetlands, gas mileage and coal pollution, over the strong opposition of a panel of scientific advisers including Trump appointees.
The Trump administration, like those who persecuted Galileo four centuries ago, views objective science as a threat to its predetermined agenda. Four more years of this, and America truly will be back in the Dark Ages.

Texto completo: If your only sense of the state of our unions is drawn from the pop culture and the prestige press, you probably think marriage in America is on the ropes.
The critically acclaimed new movie, "Marriage Story," described by its co-star Adam Driver as a "love story about divorce," provides viewers with an intimate and raw glimpse into the demise of a marriage in New York City and Hollywood. The bestselling new novel from Taffy Brodesser-Akner, "Fleishman Is in Trouble," tells a similarly bleak marriage story about another bitter divorce unfolding in New York between a doctor and a talent agent.
Or take the messages about marriage we get from the media. The New York Times recently ran an op-ed, "Beyond Marriage," from an eminent family scholar suggesting that marriage is "disappearing." Elsewhere, Brookings Institution fellow Isabel Sawhill warns, "marriage is in trouble and, however desirable, will be difficult to restore."
If we look at three key trends over the last decade in the United States, there are bright spots on the family horizon.
1. Divorce is on the rocks First, divorce is down. In fact, the divorce rate has been falling since it peaked around 1980, at the height of the divorce revolution. According to our analysis, the divorce rate has fallen by nearly 25% over the last decade to the point where there are about 15 divorces per 1,000 married people today — about the same rate as in 1970. And scholars predict that the divorce rate will continue to fall.
Surveys tell us that Americans are less tolerant of divorce today. That's in large part because, as family scholar Richard Reeves put it, "Modern marriage is not principally about money, sex, or status. It's about children." Today's married couples seem to invest more in staying together, unlike the Boomers who were obsessed with their own fulfillment in the '70s, offering their children a better shot at a more stable family life and future.
2. Children following marriage Second, non-marital childbearing is down. As Lyman Stone explained at the Institute for Family Studies, though the reasons for the decline are complex, "we are actually approaching a decade of falling births to unmarried women."
Since 2009, the rate of non-marital childbearing has fallen from 41% to 39.6% in 2018. We think what's happened, in part, is that young adults in America have become more cautious in the wake of the Great Recession about forming families and, hence, are less likely to leap into parenthood without a ring on their finger.
3. Two-parent households And, finally, the share of children being raised in intact, married families is ticking upwards. Although family instability and single parenthood are still too high, less divorce and fewer babies born out of wedlock means more stable, married families in America. Since bottoming out in 2014, we've seen a small increase in the share of children being raised by their own married parents. Specifically, the share of children being raised in intact, married families bottomed out at 61.8% in 2014 and has now risen to 62.6% in 2019, according to our analysis of Census data. What does all this mean for American children? Children raised by their married parents enjoy a host of life-long benefits compared to children born into other family forms, including more financial stability, greater physical safety, more involved fathers, and greater educational, social and psychological outcomes.

Texto completo: The Department of Agriculture recently finished work on a new rule that may take food stamps away from nearly 700,000 Americans by tightening work requirements. Several times in the past year, the government has proposed cutting food stamp eligibility. The new rule is intended to save almost $8 billion over five years.
It's not clear how much money would actually be saved, research suggests, given the costs that might come from a decline in the health and well-being of many of the country's 14.3 million "food-insecure" households.
The Department of Agriculture defines food insecurity as a lack of consistent access to enough food for an active, healthy life. It affects low-income, single-parent, and black and Latino households the most, but it cuts across many demographic lines and affects 11% of American households overall.
Citing a strong job market, the Trump administration has said helping able-bodied adults was no longer necessary. Sonny Perdue, the agriculture secretary, said: "We need to encourage people by giving them a helping hand but not allowing it to become an indefinitely giving hand."
Catherine Drennan, director of communications and public affairs at the Greater Boston Food Bank, emphasized that many people receiving assistance are underemployed or "the working poor." (The Greater Boston Food Bank distributes almost 57 million meals each year in partnership with 500 food pantries, colleges and other agencies in eastern Massachusetts.) "They work one or two jobs but still aren't earning enough to meet all their basic needs," she said.
Food insecurity is linked to worse health outcomes, including poor mental health, high blood pressure and diabetes, with children particularly vulnerable.
Low-income people may be eligible for federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits, better known as food stamps. The details vary by state.
"SNAP recipients often work, but their employment can be unsteady," said Dr. Seth Berkowitz, an internist and assistant professor at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine. Seasonal variation in some labor markets -- like agriculture or even retail consumer jobs when sales may spike around the winter holidays -- can put people temporarily out of work, making it hard for them to keep food on the table. "The way these work requirements are imposed could pull support out from under people even when they are working."
One study that Berkowitz led found that receiving SNAP benefits was associated with a reduction in annual health care spending of about $1,400 per person among low-income adults. Another study found that each additional $10 of monthly SNAP benefits was linked with a lower risk of hospitalization for Maryland residents enrolled in both Medicare and Medicaid. In Massachusetts, an increase in SNAP benefits slowed the increase in Medicaid hospitalization costs.
The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children WIC is similar to SNAP, but as its name suggests, it provides nutritional support only for low-income mothers and their young children. A recent report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that the prevalence of obesity declined from 2010 to 2016 among toddlers receiving WIC benefits. Experts suggest this may be a result of policy changes in 2009 made to better align WIC food packages with current nutritional and clinical guidelines.
For additional help, people often turn to local food pantries, such as those that partner with the Greater Boston Food Bank. Research suggests food pantries are also effective at providing immediate relief. They have far fewer eligibility requirements than SNAP or WIC -- sometimes none -- but limit when and how often clients can receive food. Some pantries are even on college campuses, helping the almost 40% of college students who report struggling to afford food.
Food pantries also serve as a community entry point for a variety of initiatives, including cooking and nutrition classes.
A review of 12 pilot pantry-based programs found these could improve participants' nutritional knowledge and diet. One of the interventions studied a novel approach to food pantry design that allows clients to choose their own food and take part in monthly nutritional goal setting. Three months in, participants were less likely than those using a traditional food pantry to experience severe food insecurity. A year later, they were eating more fruits and vegetables.
Food pantries can also connect people to the health care system, particularly for diabetes diagnosis and management. Feeding America, a national network of 200 food banks, estimates one-third of the households who use their affiliated food pantries have a member with diabetes.
One study -- conducted within Feeding America's network -- randomly assigned almost 600 food pantry clients with diabetes into a pantry-based diabetes management pilot program. About 75% of participants struggled with food insecurity. The intervention group received diabetes-tailored food boxes, blood sugar monitoring, a primary care referral if needed and diabetes self-management counseling. After six months, those in the intervention group experienced less food insecurity and were eating more fruits and vegetables. There was no significant clinical improvement related to their diabetes, suggesting that, while food pantries are a good start, further study is needed on how to best marry community intervention and the health care system.
While such interventions can help, they are not long-term solutions nor do they address underlying problems, like food deserts (communities where healthy food is hard to find) and food swamps (those where unhealthy food abounds). We eat what's available and affordable, even if that's bad food.
"The Greater Boston Food Bank is expanding its scope into several other policy efforts that get to the root causes of food insecurity," Drennan said. "For example, we recently supported an increase to the minimum wage and are supporting a healthy housing initiative that would help food-insecure Massachusetts residents experiencing homelessness."
Feeding America estimates at least 30% of those with food insecurity nationwide aren't eligible for SNAP. In some states, it's nearly 50%. Tightening eligibility for the program, as new work requirements would do, would only increase that number.

Catastrophic weather is a new normal. Is that enough to move the needle?

Texto completo: The images from Australia have been nightmarish: walls of flame, blood-red skies, residents huddled on beaches as they try to escape the inferno. The bush fires have been so intense that they have generated "fire tornadoes" powerful enough to flip over heavy trucks.
The thing is, Australia's summer of fire is only the latest in a string of catastrophic weather events over the past year: unprecedented flooding in the Midwest, a heat wave in India that sent temperatures to 123 degrees, another heat wave that brought unheard-of temperatures to much of Europe.
And all of these catastrophes were related to climate change.
Notice that I said "related to" rather than "caused by" climate change. This is a distinction that has flummoxed many people over the years. Any individual weather event has multiple causes, which was one reason news reports used to avoid mentioning the possible role of climate change in natural disasters.
In recent years, however, climate scientists have tried to cut through this confusion by engaging in "extreme event attribution," which focuses on probabilities: You can't necessarily say that climate change caused a particular heat wave, but you can ask how much difference global warming made to the probability of that heat wave happening. And the answer, typically, is a lot: Climate change makes the kinds of extreme weather events we've been seeing much more likely.
And while there's a lot of randomness in weather outcomes, that randomness actually makes climate change much more damaging in its early stages than most people realize. On our current trajectory, Florida as a whole will eventually be swallowed by the sea, but long before that happens, rising sea levels will make catastrophic storm surges commonplace. Much of India will eventually become uninhabitable, but killing heat waves and droughts will take a deadly toll well before that point is reached.
Put it this way: While it will take generations for the full consequences of climate change to play out, there will be many localized, temporary disasters along the way. Apocalypse will become the new normal -- and that's happening right in front of our eyes.
The big question is whether the proliferation of climate-related disasters will finally be enough to break though the opposition to action.
There are some hopeful signs. One is that the news media has become much more willing to talk about the role of climate change in weather events.
Not long ago it was all too common to read articles about heat waves, floods and droughts that seemed to go to great lengths to avoid mentioning climate change. My sense is that reporters and editors have finally gotten over that block.
The public also seems to be paying attention, with concern about climate change growing substantially over the past few years.
The bad news is that growing climate awareness is mainly taking place among Democrats; the Republican base is largely unmoved.
And the anti-environmental extremism of conservative politicians has, if anything, become even more intense as their position has become intellectually untenable. The right used to pretend that there was a serious scientific dispute about the reality of global warming and its sources. Now Republicans, and the Trump administration in particular, have simply become hostile to science in general. Hey, aren't scientists effectively part of the deep state?
Furthermore, this isn't just a U.S. problem. Even as Australia burns, its current government is reaffirming its commitment to coal and threatening to make boycotts of environmentally destructive businesses a crime.
The sick irony of the current situation is that anti-environmentalism is getting more extreme precisely at the moment when the prospects for decisive action should be better than ever.
On one side, the dangers of climate change are no longer predictions about the future: We can see the damage now, although it's only a small taste of the horrors that lie ahead.
On the other side, drastic reductions in greenhouse gas emissions now look remarkably easy to achieve, at least from an economic point of view. In particular, there has been so much technological progress in alternative energy that the Trump administration is trying desperately to prop up coal against competition from solar and wind.
So will environmental policy play a role in the 2020 campaign? Most Democrats seem disinclined to make it a major issue, and I understand why: Historically, the threat posed by right-wing environmental policy seemed abstract, distant and hard to run on compared with, say, Republican attempts to dismantle Obamacare.
But the wave of climate-related catastrophes may be changing the political calculus. I'm not a campaign expert, but it seems to me that campaigns might get some traction with ads showing recent fires and floods and pointing out that Donald Trump and his friends are doing everything they can to create more such disasters. For the truth is that Trump's environmental policy is the worst thing he's doing to America and the world. And voters should know that.

Marijuana's deaths and illnesses get too little press

Texto completo: I've covered things that injure, sicken and kill kids and adults for more than 30 years. From auto safety to medical errors, I've competed to break stories on the latest deadly defect or health policy change, most recently on electronic cigarettes. In late August, I added vaping-related lung illnesses to the beat. Last month, I added marijuana, psychosis and other mental illnesses.
It's a pretty solitary place to be.
A search on the news archive Nexis shows that the number of stories mentioning "vaping" and "lung illness" went from 953 in September to 584 in October, a nearly 40% drop.
The deaths and injuries from lung illnesses are declining, but they've hardly abated and are clearly a sign of a much larger problem with excessive marijuana use among young people. Yet families from the D'Ambrosios in California to the Donats in Connecticut were caught unaware.
Ricky D'Ambrosio, 21, was in a medically induced coma for four of the 10 days he was hospitalized in August after vaping THC from a dispensary. He had a medical marijuana card.
D'Ambrosio's recovering well now, but my Connecticut high school friend Billy Donat's family wasn't so lucky.
Last week, Donat emailed me for the first time: "Sometimes we reach out to old friends at the worst of times, this is one of those times. On Christmas Day, my son of 22 years put an electric cord around his neck and hung himself one day after his release from Yale Psychiatric Hospital. On the table in the living room was a copy (of) USA Today dated 12/16/2019. I told my son that you had written an article about his condition linking pot to psychosis. SCHIZOPHRENIA. I had read the front page at the news stand. I wish I had turned to page 6 and finished the article."
If he had, he would have seen that the federal "mental health czar" and psychiatrist, Elinore McCance-Katz, lamenting how little attention the "settled science" on pot and psychosis gets and the huge increase in suicides among young people with marijuana in their systems in Colorado.
On Tuesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said 2,561 people have been hospitalized with vaping-related lung illness and 55 have died. That's one more death and over 50 more hospitalizations from two weeks earlier.
CDC said 80% of hospitalized patients who had complete information about their products reported vaping THC; 13% said they vaped just nicotine.
Most everyone I talk to — even some doctors — say nicotine vaping and Juul, especially, is what's clogging kids' lungs. If it is, it hasn't been identified by the many scientists who have reported their findings. They have only been able to find vitamin E acetate from THC oil in the patients' lungs.
There has been an outcry to ban flavored electronic cigarettes — or all of them, as in San Francisco — and Congress voted to raise the age for all e-cigarette tobacco products to 21 last month. The Trump administration announced plans Thursday to restrict most flavors of the one-time-use pods in e-cigarettes.
But what about when the industry isn't an easily identified and demonized monolith like Big Tobacco or ... Juul? What if the purported problem is something advocates have been trying to get mandated or legalized for years?
Former New York Times business reporter Alex Berenson says that the human cost of cannabis is too high — and that the press is too pro-pot. When his latest book, "Tell Your Children: The Truth about Marijuana, Mental Illness and Violence," came out last year, he knew marijuana proponents wouldn't like it. He just didn't think there would be what he calls a "media brownout": No major publications reviewed it. (USA TODAY interviewed him for a March article.)
Berenson, a registered independent who didn't have strong feelings about marijuana legalization until he researched his book, has become an unlikely favorite of the conservative media and think tanks. He blames what he says is "a genuine misunderstanding of the strength of the science supporting the cannabis-psychosis link," which is worsened by "the endless industry/advocacy yelling about 'Reefer Madness.'"
"Reefer Madness" was a 1936 movie that used crazed marijuana users to show the purported risks of the drug.
"The cannabis lobby ... will personally attack anyone who tries to raise the issue," Berenson says.
Last month, the National Institute on Drug Abuse reported new data showing that marijuana use by students from eighth to 12th grade was way up — with 1 in 5 high school seniors vaping it in the past year.
The recent story I wrote with colleagues on marijuana's link to mental health ran on the front page and was one of the top stories on our website for days. More than 250 people with children or personal experience with mental illness linked to marijuana joined our Facebook support group — I Survived It.
I don't know about you, but that makes me pay attention.

Texto completo: LGBTQ films have evolved in themes ranging from aging and forbidden love to social struggles, heartbreak and, in recent years, parenting. The 2020 Palm Springs International Film Festival offers several LGBTQ films that are emotionally powerful, offering a view as to how society has changed its perceptions of sexuality, and how certain countries still have ongoing struggles with equality.
One of the most talked about films at this year's festival is the Spanish movie "Pain and Glory," directed by Pedro Almodovar and starring Antonio Banderas as a a gay film director named Salvador Mallo.
It won Banderas a "Best Actor" award at the Cannes Film Festival and it was also nominated in the "Queer Palm" category, Cannes' prize for LGBTQ-related films. It also has Golden Globe nominations and Oscar buzz. TIME called "Pain and Glory" the "best film of 2019."
It screens at 1:45 p.m. on Jan. 6 and 4:15 p.m. on Jan. 7.
Festival programmers mentioned many other LGBTQ films that include powerful stories. Here are some others receiving acclaim to check out at the film festival:
'Moffie' (South Africa) Set in South Africa during apartheid in 1981, this autobiographical drama written by Andre Carl van der Merwe follows two young gay teenagers trying to come to terms with their sexuality while sharing a forbidden love during the country's 23-year border war with Angola. It premiered at the Venice International Film Festival in September.
"Anyone who grew up gay in pre-millennial South Africa may need to dig their nails into their armrest to get through what is both a shiver-delicate exploration of unspoken desire and a scarringly brilliant anatomy of white South African masculinity," wrote Variety film critic Guy Lodge in his review of the film.
Screenings: 6 p.m., Jan. 8, Regal Cinemas; 1:30 p.m., Jan. 9, Mary Pickford is D'Place; 1:45 p.m., Jan. 11, Palm Springs Cultural Center
'Portrait of a Lady on Fire' (France) Director Celine Schiamma made history at the Cannes Film Festival in September after she became the first woman to win the "Queer Palm" award for her French 18th-century romance, "Portrait of a Lady on Fire." The film also won Best Screenplay at the festival.
It's a forbidden love story about a young painter who teaches art lessons and a young woman who she is commissioned to paint. A.O. Scott of The New York Times called it "a subtle and thrilling love story, at once unsentimental in its assessment of women's circumstances and almost utopian in its celebration of the freedom that is nonetheless available to them."
Screenings: 3:15, p.m., Jan. 9, Palm Springs High School; 9 a.m., Jan. 10, Mary Pickford is D'Place
'Retablo' (Peru) First screened at the 2017 Festival de Cine de Lima in Peru, where it won the award for Best Peruvian Film, "Retablo" picked up steam on the festival circuit in Berlin in 2018 and at the Havana Film Festival in New York in 2019.
The film follows a young boy in Peru who is being trained by his father to design and build religious retablos, which are Catholic-inspired religious imagery, but he discovers something about his father that makes him question his own masculinity.
It is one of two films submitted for consideration to the Oscars by Latin American countries that have, in the past, had oppressive anti-LGBTQ laws, according to Palm Springs International Film Festival programmer Hebe Tabachnik.
"I think it's huge, it's a big step forward," Tabachnik said.
Screenings: 3:45 p.m., Jan. 7, Regal Cinemas
'Stage Mother' (U.S.) In this drama starring Jacki Weaver, Lucy Liu and drag star Jackie Beat, a conservative Texas church choir director (played by Weaver) inherits a San Francisco drag club from her deceased gay son, from whom she was estranged due to his sexuality. When she discovers the eclectic world of drag through the club's performers, she decides to stay and help save the club from financial ruin and make peace with herself for disowning her son years before.
Screenings: 12:45 p.m., Jan. 12, Mary Pickford is D'Place
'And Then We Danced' (Sweden) When this Swedish-Georgian gay romance film about two male dancers was scheduled for screenings in the Georgian cities of Tbilisi and Batumi, ultra-conservative and pro-Russian groups threatened to have them cancelled. Riot police mobilized outside of the theater, and protesters used pyrotechnics in an attempt to gain entry into the Amirani Theatre in Tibilisi, according to Interpressnews.
The film is Sweden's International Feature Film entry to the Oscars. Jude Dry of IndieWire called it "one of the year's best gay films."
Screenings: 7:30 p.m., Jan. 7, Palm Springs Cultural Center; 1:45 p.m., Jan. 8, Regal Cinemas; 12:45 p.m., Jan. 9, Mary Pickford is D'Place

Texto completo: January 1, 2030
To my three sons:
I'm so proud of you. I especially appreciate that, now that you're 21, 18, and 16 years old, you no longer fight with each other constantly like you did when you were little. You're all doing well in school, and have bright futures ahead.
But please never forget how lucky you've been to come of age in California during this now-concluding decade, the Roaring 2020s. Our state is doing so well that it's hard to remember how fraught things seemed 10 years ago.
Back then, California faced a dire housing shortage and had one of the nation's highest poverty rates. Digital technology was causing massive disruption. Mega-fires were destroying homes and killing people. And the federal government was undermining our desperate efforts to reckon with these problems.
"It's the End of California As We Know It," declared a New York Times column in 2019.
Worse still, neither governments nor businesses had the tools to deal with problems that seemed too big and overwhelming. Amidst these feelings of hopelessness we fell even deeper into a bad habit. We started declaring that we would solve certain problems by a set year — without having real plans to do it.
As a target year, 2030 came up again and again. State politicians talked constantly about the need to reduce emissions to 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030. But those goals weren't accompanied by realistic plans to achieve the requisite remissions reductions — especially in the face of increasing emissions from transportation and wildfires.
2030 fantasies went much further than climate, though. In 2018, the state Department of Education declared a goal under "Global California 2030" of making half of all K-12 students proficient in two or more languages. But no one provided the funding for the immersion programs and foreign language teachers necessary to make it happen.
In retrospect, too many of our 2030 goals were too small and underfunded — like the state's plans to build up long-term care and other services for seniors when the population of people over 65 doubled between 2015 and 2030. Or the University of California's underwhelming "UC 2030," which outlined the modest goal of increasing graduation rates a few points.
Since the three of you were so young at that time, you may not remember the two early 2020s calamities that shook California out of its stupor.
First, the 2019 housing crisis got dramatically worse. The state kept making new demands for housing, but local governments, kept opposing new construction. In January 2021, thousands of homeless Californians, desperate for shelter and action, stormed the Capitol, kicked out all the legislators — and made the building their home for the next year.
At the same time, a nasty national recession hit, sparked a federal debt default. In a 2021 poll, half of Californians feared they could become homeless.
That drove the Golden State to radical action.
During 2008's Great Recession, California had considered replacing its old Constitution, which made governing in crisis impossible, with a new system. But elites instead decided to make budget cuts and suffer through the pain of unemployment and foreclosures. But by 2021 it was clear that the governing system needed to change to give people and leaders the agency to deal with our problems.
Looking back, the biggest driver of California change wasn't self-driving cars or cheaper space rockets but the new Constitution, drafted in early 2022 and approved by voters later that year. Crucially, this Constitution took powers away from state government, thus creating more freedom for regions and local communities to govern themselves.
The effect was startling, rapid, and deep. The state's regions were able to accelerate housing, remake transportation systems, take back control of crucial utilities, and ramp up economic development on their own. In one constitutional moment, so many pent-up ambitions were unleashed that the entire state seemed to roar with new innovation.
In retrospect, we should have been able to see more of the potential within ourselves. Back in 2019, I traveled the state as a columnist and often marveled that, for all the state's structural problems, our local communities still made progress, from the innovative development of West Sacramento to the fiscal reforms of Glendale. Even in the despair of 2020, Fresno was remaking itself into our next great city, and L.A. was so boldly rebuilding its transit system that city governments in Boston and New York took notice.
Now, if I had written a letter like this to you in January 2020, it would have been dismissed as a fairy tale. People's moods were just too dark back then.
But, looking back, the biggest lesson is clear: deep within our hearts and communities, Californians carry possibilities so grand that the future may happily surprise us.
Love,
Dad

Early days of Centreville

Texto completo: Centreville encountered growing pains typical of a small town. Residents very often unconventionally solved their problems.
Important events have occurred the first week of January.
Here is an instance.
On Jan. 2, 1815, a survey of a little hamlet is recorded.
The town had been laid out on Oct. 20, 1814 and was officially recorded on Jan. 2, 1815. That makes this town, Centreville, the oldest surviving town in Wayne County. (Salisbury, platted in 1811, no longer exists.)
Two men from Cincinnati, Israel Elliott and Ethan A. Stone, donated ground so level and muddy, there was fear it would degenerate into a mud hole.
At the first sale of 'mud hole' lots, Revolutionary War veteran Christopher Roddy dubbed the site Centreville because it was so centrally located. At the time there were a dozen people within what would become town limits.
(The Aug. 23, 1964, Palladium in a story about Centerville history states on page 3, "Through some trick of fate, the original spelling of the name of this Wayne County town has been changed through the years without it being officially recorded. Centerville was originally spelled Centreville, according to a copy of the 1815 territorial laws and, as far as is known, no official act reversed the 're' in the center to 're.'")
The first innkeeper was Rachel Neal. The first blacksmith was Isaac Forkner. The first hatter was Jacob N. Booker. The first merchant was Samuel P. Booker. The first physician was David F. Sackett. The first lawyer was Bethuel Morris. The first church in town was the Methodist Episcopal Church, formed in 1822.
The men were clad in deerskin trousers, moccasins and blue hint-shirts, with a belt to which a knife was fastened and from which hung a tobacco pouch of polecat skin. The women wore gowns of homespun cotton with calico or gingham bonnets.
Rebecca Julian wrote of their lives:
"I have thought proper to mention these matters in order that people may now know what the first settlers had to undergo... The country around us (1810) was an entire wilderness, with here and there a small cabin, containing a small family. We were nearly all new beginners at that time, and although we had to work almost day and night, we were not discouraged... Our husbands cleared the land, and assisted each other in rolling the logs. We often went with them on these occasions, to assist in the way of cooking for the hands. We had first-rate times, just as hard laboring men and women can appreciate. We were not what would be called stylish cooks... The substantials we prepared in plain, honest, old-fashioned style. This is one reason why we were so blessed with health... It was not in style to be weakly. We could take our spinning wheels and walk two miles to a spinning frolic, to do our day's work, and after a first-rate supper, join in some innocent amusement for the evening. We did not take any particular pains to keep our hands dirt-free; we never thought of having hands just to look at... We did not complain half as much as people do now (1840s). Our diet was plain, our clothing we manufactured ourselves; we lived independent and all were on an equality. I look back on these by-gone days with great affection. How the scene has changed. Children of these same pioneers know nothing of hardship; they are spoiled by indulgence, and are generally planning ways and means to live without work."
By 1826 Centreville had two stores, three taverns, one grocery, one wagon-maker, one wheelwright, two plasterers, one tinsmith, one saddler, two blacksmiths, two cabinet makers, two shoemakers, one millwright, five carpenters, two bricklayers, one tailor, two tanners, three physicians, three lawyers, one school, a post office and a Western Times printing press office. The population was about 200.
Residents eventually attained more solid footing than anyone else around when the town got the first paved streets in Indiana, "being paved by the government as a mark of distinction to the promising Wayne County capitol in the thirties (1830s)."
A series of five beautiful archways, now scattered about Centerville, were built between 1832 and 1836, which are the inspiration for the town's annual Archway Days Festival celebrating local heritage.
The first Charter of a Masonic Lodge had its first meeting in Centreville. Hiram Lodge number 42 — organized in 1845 and chartered in 1846 — had a membership of 10. Sadly, preparations for the first official meeting were stopped by the shocked discovery there was no Bible to swear officers in. Resident Abner Jones raced across the street to fetch his family Bible and saved the day. The much-touted Lodge was a distinctly proud one, having been organized "with the feeling being so strong there for it" to be located at the county seat. Unfortunately Centerville "forfeited the charter in 1868 because it admitted to its membership a man with a wooden leg," which was against rules. The charter was removed in 1869. Centerville Masons were resilient; they merely re-charted in 1870, changing the rule.
Centreville encountered growing pains typical of a small town. Residents very often unconventionally solved their problems.
As a vital artery on the Old National Road during the nation's 19th century westward expansion, Centerville provided creature comforts along the way, especially when the eastside Whitehall Tavern opened in 1840 as an exchange station for tired horses and as a place for weary travelers to rest and dine.
The three-story structure accommodated wayfarers "in style."
On June 30, 1858, the women of Centerville accommodated the way station (now the Mansion House) "in style" by smashing the interior to pieces due the rampant liquor and gambling.
On that boiling day a bevvy of "hot" Centerville women stormed what would become the Mansion House to accomplish what the men of the town could not: they set out to eradicate the "dark beverage from H-ll" (whiskey) being sold, to halt gambling and to staunch "the filthy tobacco habit." The women are alleged to have worn long coats and shawls despite the sweltering heat. Under their garments they clutched hatchets and axes, as they marched in formation from the Methodist church while the church bell rang. They stepped uniformly with brazen intent in a pre-arranged pact to salvage local men from the demonic subservience of liquor, cigars and card playing.
Locals reacted in hushed whispers; doors closed like in western movies when gunfighters ambled down the street to fight.
Women loudly aggrieved, "Dissolute ways!" "Sickening!" "Barbaric!" "Do not besmirch God!"
Jake Vonderwright, the owner, saw them and bolted the door, then "vamoosed" out the back way.
Locked doors were no barrier to Centerville female 'firebrands.' They knocked at first civilly, knuckling their fingers; then pounded uncivilly with fists. Next they took out their implements of destruction and chopped and hacked, "tattooing marks in the door." They busted through and destroyed everything that had to do with demonic card vices and "drunkard-ness brought on by Satanic inclination."
At a time when women lacked equitable legal, educational and voting access; at a time when local male rationale failed to "halt the curse" of whiskey and cards, the females of Centerville marched with axes and clubs "to end the sin of the liquor temple" and to smash, smash, SMASH! The raid testified to the resolute resolve of Center Township womanhood as an intimidation "unto even men of chilled steel!"
Local newspapers proudly lauded them.
More on Centreville next week.

The human cost of marijuana is so high

Texto completo: I've covered things that injure, sicken and kill kids and adults for more than 30 years. From auto safety to medical errors, I've competed to break stories on the latest deadly defect or health policy change, most recently on electronic cigarettes. In late August, I added vaping-related lung illnesses to the beat. Last month, I added marijuana, psychosis and other mental illnesses.
It's a pretty solitary place to be.
A search on the news archive Nexis shows that the number of stories mentioning "vaping" and "lung illness" went from 953 in September to 584 in October, a nearly 40% drop.
The deaths and injuries from lung illnesses are declining, but they've hardly abated and are clearly a sign of a much larger problem with excessive marijuana use among young people. Yet families from the D'Ambrosios in California to the Donats in Connecticut were caught unaware.
Ricky D'Ambrosio, 21, was in a medically induced coma for four of the 10 days he was hospitalized in August after vaping THC from a dispensary. He had a medical marijuana card.
D'Ambrosio's recovering well now, but my Connecticut high school friend Billy Donat's family wasn't so lucky.
Last week, Donat emailed me for the first time: "Sometimes we reach out to old friends at the worst of times, this is one of those times. On Christmas Day, my son of 22 years put an electric cord around his neck and hung himself one day after his release from Yale Psychiatric Hospital. On the table in the living room was a copy (of) USA Today dated 12/16/2019. I told my son that you had written an article about his condition linking pot to psychosis. SCHIZOPHRENIA. I had read the front page at the news stand. I wish I had turned to page 6 and finished the article."
If he had, he would have seen that the federal "mental health czar" and psychiatrist, Elinore McCance-Katz, lamenting how little attention the "settled science" on pot and psychosis gets and the huge increase in suicides among young people with marijuana in their systems in Colorado.
Vaping THC
On Tuesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said 2,561 people have been hospitalized with vaping-related lung illness and 55 have died. That's one more death and over 50 more hospitalizations from two weeks earlier.
CDC said 80% of hospitalized patients who had complete information about their products reported vaping THC; 13% said they vaped just nicotine.
Most everyone I talk to -- even some doctors -- say nicotine vaping and Juul, especially, is what's clogging kids' lungs. If it is, it hasn't been identified by the many scientists who have reported their findings. They have only been able to find vitamin E acetate from THC oil in the patients' lungs.
There has been an outcry to ban flavored electronic cigarettes -- or all of them, as in San Francisco -- and Congress voted to raise the age for all e-cigarette tobacco products to 21 last month. The Trump administration announced plans Thursday to restrict most flavors of the one-time-use pods in e-cigarettes.
But what about when the industry isn't an easily identified and demonized monolith like Big Tobacco or Juul? What if the purported problem is something advocates have been trying to get mandated or legalized for years?
Press too pro-pot?
Former New York Times business reporter Alex Berenson says that the human cost of cannabis is too high -- and that the press is too pro-pot. When his latest book, "Tell Your Children: The Truth about Marijuana, Mental Illness and Violence," came out last year, he knew marijuana proponents wouldn't like it. He just didn't think there would be what he calls a "media brownout": No major publications reviewed it. (USA TODAY interviewed him for a March article.)
Berenson, a registered independent who didn't have strong feelings about marijuana legalization until he researched his book, has become an unlikely favorite of the conservative media and think tanks. He blames what he says is "a genuine misunderstanding of the strength of the science supporting the cannabis-psychosis link," which is worsened by "the endless industry/advocacy yelling about 'Reefer Madness.'"
"Reefer Madness" was a 1936 movie that used crazed marijuana users to show the purported risks of the drug.
"The cannabis lobby will personally attack anyone who tries to raise the issue," Berenson says.
Last month, the National Institute on Drug Abuse reported new data showing that marijuana use by students from eighth to 12th grade was way up -- with 1 in 5 high school seniors vaping it in the past year.
The recent story I wrote with colleagues on marijuana's link to mental health ran on the front page and was one of the top stories on our website for days. More than 250 people with children or personal experience with mental illness linked to marijuana joined our Facebook support group -- I Survived It.
I don't know about you, but that makes me pay attention.

Texto completo: Matt Drudge, a titanic figure in American conservative media, appears to be slipping in influence - a change that could impact the 2020 election.
A force for decades, Drudge has angered a key constituency in recent months: supporters of President Donald Trump. The most passionate presidential partisans see Drudge as far less supportive of the president than he once was, and much less than they believe he should be. Trump-supporting websites and personalities have voiced outrage, and grassroots activists have taken to social media to express their displeasure.
The shift in Drudge's sentiments, and the void that leaves, could be significant.
Though not a household name on the same level as cable TV's Fox News Channel or radio's Rush Limbaugh, Drudge, who lives in southwest Miami-Dade County, has grown into a media powerhouse in recent decades via the self-titled Drudge Report.
The reason for the dissatisfaction is unclear. Drudge famously avoids publicity, and he didn't respond to emailed inquiries for this report.
Drudge, 53, remains a somewhat opaque figure - described as "elusive" in the Washington Post, "reclusive and powerful" by The Week, and as someone "who rarely allows himself to be seen or heard in public" by The Guardian.
Many pictures of him show him wearing a fedora, in the vein of grizzled newspaper reporters depicted in movies in the last century.
Drudge's base of operations is a five-bedroom, four-and-a-half bath home in a secluded area halfway between Homestead and Kendall in South Florida. Though enjoying outsize influence with conservatives, he's registered as a no party affiliation/independent voter.
He started on the West Coast, in the 1990s, writing a Hollywood-based email newsletter focused on entertainment gossip before he transitioned to politics and a website. He exploded in prominence in 1998 with a blockbuster report that Newsweek magazine was declining to publish a story about then-President Bill Clinton's relationship with White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
Drudge writes relatively little of the information on his site himself. Drudge Report is an aggregator, a website that publishes links to a wide range of articles produced elsewhere. It provides one-stop shopping to a variety of news, largely political, but also links to stories about culture, science, natural disasters and oddities. His stock in trade is compelling, often incendiary and sometimes sensationalized headlines that are especially good at getting attention. Historically the headlines have had a conservative spin, even if the original source's headline and article are neutral.
For much of Trump's rise as a candidate and as president, their interests didn't diverge. Early in 2019, the president himself was so happy with the Drudge Report that he tweeted a picture of its key headlines on the day of State of the Union address: "Call For Unity," "Trump Approval 48%," and "Teflon Donald."
No more.
There are clearly headlines that Trump and his supporters dislike, such as "Trump Vowed to Shrink the Trade Gap. It Keeps Growing..." and "Manufacturers struggling in Rust Belt..." on Nov. 6 or "Colonel testifies he raised concerns about Ukraine, Trump..." and "Trump assumes Obama's mantle as the 'king of debt'..." on Oct. 30.
An early alarm was sounded by Limbaugh, on his radio program in June. And this fall, criticism boiled over in conservative and pro-Trump media.
*"Et tu, Drudge? Alarm grows on right over site's anti-Trump pivot," from the Washington Times.
*"He may not be able to earn back the trust of Trump supporters who feel betrayed that Drudge appears to have joined the resistance now," said PJ Media, which warned the change could "backfire big time."
*"We have no special knowledge of why The Drudge Report has changed so noticeably. But it has," said the polling firm Rasmussen Reports, which is known for its surveys that show higher Trump approval than other polls and is frequently cited by the president.
*"What happened to Matt Drudge?" asked Gateway Pundit, which this week proclaimed that Drudge "continues to push corrupt anti-Trump news."
"There was definitely a major shift. Something happened," said Karyn Turk, a conservative TV and radio personality who hosts "Behind the Headlines" celebrity TV segments. "I've been watching this unfold and I've been very intrigued by it."
"I don't look at it anymore," said Randy Lundi, who lost a campaign for Congress in Ohio in 1994 and now lives in Jupiter. "It seems to me that we're getting echoes of the Drudge Report."
The internet - the very thing that Drudge used to become successful - is filled with theories. Fox News personality Jesse Watters said in a November segment that it's hard to tell if "he's riding a wave for clicks or there's something personally inside his heart or his mind that has shifted against the president."
One of the Drudge Report links that Watters listed as as "negative" was a Gallup poll reporting Trump's approval was 42%.
Drudge's influence is also suffering for other reasons.
Audience attitudes are changing as Trump has commanded increasing loyalty, said David Greenberg, a professor of history and journalism and media studies at Rutgers University. "If Drudge is putting forward a version of what the conservatives or the Republican Party should be that's out of 2015, then he may be losing some of his readers, who may be on board with this remaking of the Republican Party under Trump," Greenberg said.
Drudge isn't alone in feeling effects of an audience that's become ever-more supportive of Trump. Many of the president's most ardent supporters even find the reliably pro-Trump Fox News lacking at times, and they're touting the even more pro-Trump network One America News Network.
New competitors are offering more of what that audience wants. "Because of our increasing desire for sources that agree with us, people will hunt down and find very specific news sources," said Kevin Wagner, a political scientist at Florida Atlantic University. "You never have to be confronted with uncomfortable truths. If you confront it, you can choose to leave it."
Drudge still offers red meat to conservatives, such as "Biden's brain surgeon defends his brain..." on Aug. 21, immediately above "Biden recalls MLK, Bobby Kennedy assassinations 'in the late 70s'...." or the Oct. 16 banner headline that blared "Warren takes heat."
But some of the newcomers are unabashedly further to the right than Drudge and proclaim themselves as unwavering in their devotion to Trump.
The Bongino Report, launched Dec. 4, is operated by the outspoken and controversial Dan Bongino, a former Secret Service agent who has unsuccessfully run for U.S. Senate and U.S. House in Maryland and U.S. House in Florida. Bongino didn't respond to a request for comment, but he made his sentiments clear on Twitter: "Drudge has abandoned you. I NEVER will."
While Drudge Report links to articles from a variety of news organizations, - including the New York Times and Washington Post, derided by Trump and his supporters - Bongino links to decidedly right-wing news sources, many of which aren't familiar names. Bongino told The Wrap that his site would never link to news from the Times or Post "unless it's to make fun of them."
Some people get their news differently than when Drudge rose to prominence. "I haven't been on the Drudge Report in the longest time," said Michael Barnett, chairman of the Palm Beach Republican Party. "I don't have a problem with Drudge. It's just I don't think of it."
Instead, Barnett said, he gets turns first to Twitter, Instagram and Facebook.

Texto completo: At noon in the parking lot outside a Carolina Panthers game in November, Dean Nass, 64, pressed a button on his laptop. "The Star Spangled Banner" began to play. His friends and family - 15 in all - put down their barbecued chicken, potato salad and cans of beer and stood at attention.
The Nass family isn't the only one that has united around football and the flag during the past two decades. The NFL has made patriotism an integral part of the spectacle surrounding the game on the field, and, at times, has had it placed at the center of controversies off it.
Military personnel in uniform, fighter jet flyovers, field-size flags, and red, white and blue festooned NFL jerseys have become part of the game's landscape. Despite criticism from certain corners about politicizing the game, the league has continued to embrace symbols of patriotism. Some teams even accepted money from the Department of Defense for patriotic displays during games; the league eventually returned more than $700,000 following an audit.
How the league and its players express their patriotism became a fraught issue in 2016, when Colin Kaepernick, then a quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers, knelt during the playing of the national anthem to raise awareness of police brutality against African Americans (after initially sitting on the bench, he chose to kneel on the advice of a former Green Beret). A handful of other players followed his example. Then, in 2017, President Donald Trump ignited a firestorm when he suggested during a political rally that NFL owners should fire players who refused to stand for the national anthem. Kaepernick, who left the 49ers after the 2016 season, has not had a job in the NFL since.
The ties between sports and displays of patriotism go back at least a century. Fans first stood to salute the flag while singing the national anthem at the 1918 World Series. In 1942, during World War II, Congress wrote regulations, enshrined in a federal law but without penalties for violations, outlining the significance of the flag and how to properly respect it - regulations that are largely ignored today, especially at sporting events.
According to the code, the flag "should never be carried flat," "never be used as wearing apparel" and "never be used for advertising." Additionally, "no part of the flag should ever be used as a costume or athletic uniform."
"The flag should not be used for advertising," said David Janik, president of the National Flag Day Foundation, an advisory group in Waubeka, Wisconsin, "but the flag displayed in all respectful manners I believe is fine."
As the NFL grew in popularity through the 1960s, it made a determined effort - led by Pete Rozelle, its commissioner and a Navy veteran - to align itself with patriotism. In 1968, Rozelle organized the first military flyover at a Super Bowl. Before long, in addition to USO trips and visits to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, honor guards and other staples of the military became a fixture at many of the NFL's biggest events, as well as those in other leagues.
So has the occasional protest, whether it was Kaepernick or Megan Rapinoe, the soccer player, not putting her hand on her heart during the national anthem, or a cheerleader at Kennesaw State University in Georgia kneeling during the song.
The patriotic gestures can even extend to fan-driven actions off the field as well. At a game between the Panthers and the Tennessee Titans in early November, three teenagers dressed in fatigues moved from tailgate to tailgate, collecting donations in a boot for wreaths that would be laid on the graves of war veterans.
By the end of November, every NFL team had hosted a Salute to Service game, during which active-duty military members and veterans could watch the game from field-level suites. Players shook their hands, thanking them for their service.
Spurred on by the public address announcer, fans repeatedly jumped to their feet for standing ovations. For Taira Davis, an ex-Marine and a police officer of 20 years, it meant a lot. "From my perspective, we never made a lot of money," Davis said, "so being able to go to something like that was huge. It's a special treat. And you know for someone to give you tickets, and for you to walk in there and be appreciated too? That's big."
At the Panthers game, Bart Bazquez, a Marine, used his phone to take pictures of his friend Thomas Garza, also a Marine, as he posed by a fountain with a Marine Corps embroidered flag. "I think people see football players how they see military," Garza said, "watching them from a distance, idolizing them."
There were American flags, including one that measured 75 feet wide and 25 feet high that members of the military unfurled on the field before the opening kick.
The patriotic pomp can have unintended consequences, especially when the simple act of watching a football game becomes a political statement, as it did for some in recent years. Davis, who served eight years in the Marines as a food service specialist before her career in law enforcement, said for years her family had a satellite television subscription so they could watch football.
"We haven't had a TV in about two years because the games just became too political," she said. "You can't enjoy it."

Texto completo: Journalism is supposed to make events clearer, but too often in Washington it obfuscates. Witness the obsession on the Sunday TV news shows over whether the threat from Qasem Soleimani was "imminent."
On "Meet the Press," host Chuck Todd highlighted or asked about the "imminent" point no fewer than seven times, four times with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Mr. Todd: "So was the justification in that he's been this destabilizing force in the region for so long? Or was the justification this imminent threat?"
Mr. Pompeo: "Chuck, it's never one thing. You've been at this a long time. The American people are smart, too. It's never one moment. It's never one instance. It's a collective. It's a full situational awareness of risk and analysis."
Mr. Todd wasn't satisfied, so he then unleashed the query on Mark Warner, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee: "How imminent does it seem? And is it any different than what Soleimani's been doing over the last decade?"
Mr. Warner: "I accept the notion that there was a real threat. The question of how imminent is something that I need more information on."
Don't bother, Senator. If the threat to Americans from Soleimani was real, it doesn't matter under international law whether the threat was "imminent." The traditional law of war couldn't be clearer on this point. If Soleimani was an enemy combatant waging war on the U.S., then the U.S. has every right to target him. If he was directing attacks on the U.S., as not even Chuck Todd doubts he was, then he can be legally targeted.
Some on the political left would like to change the law of war to adopt the "imminent" standard for the use of force. But this would hamstring law-abiding nations from preventing attacks until the moment they are about to happen. The standard would also give terrorists and rogue state actors more space and time to plot to kill Americans.
The Pentagon was careful not to use the word "imminent" in its statement after the killing of Soleimani, though a couple of spokesmen have emphasized the urgency of the intelligence threats. The New York Times followed with a weekend story quoting sources, unidentified of course, saying a threat wasn't imminent. The political point seems to be to delegitimize the killing of Soleimani.
But that is irrelevant. Soleimani was an enemy combatant waging war against America. His proxy forces targeted U.S. troops 11 times in recent months and stormed the U.S. Embassy last week. Killing him was justified under the laws of war and is a blow for deterrence against those who would kill Americans with impunity.

FAA Considers More Training for Pilots of MAX Jets

Texto completo: Federal aviation regulators are considering mandatory flight-simulator training before U.S. pilots can operate Boeing Co.'s 737 MAX jets again, according to government and industry officials familiar with the deliberations, a change that would repudiate one of the plane maker's longstanding arguments.
The Federal Aviation Administration months ago rejected the idea -- which would entail extra costs and delays for airlines -- as unnecessary. But in recent weeks, these officials said, requiring such training before returning the grounded U.S. MAX fleet to the air has gained momentum among agency and industry safety experts.
"The deliberations appear headed for a much different direction than before," according to one of the officials, who described increased FAA emphasis on the topic.
The FAA's formal decision isn't expected until February or later, and the situation remains fluid. An agency spokeswoman declined to comment on specifics, saying more analysis and testing is required.
"The FAA does not have a timeline for this process," she said. "And at this point our primary concern is ensuring a complete and thorough review of the aircraft."
A Boeing spokesman said: "We are thoroughly evaluating all aspects of a safe return to service including pilot training, procedures and checklists." He added that Boeing will follow the recommendations of regulators world-wide and its priority is supplying any information they seek.
Boeing has long maintained 737 MAX pilots don't need supplemental simulator training beyond what pilots receive to fly other 737 models, a stance that many FAA officials now regard with increasing skepticism, according to the officials.
The FAA's changed outlook on simulator training has arisen partly because Boeing and regulators are proposing rewriting some emergency checklists for pilots and creating some new ones, according to some of these officials.
In addition, one of these officials said, the FAA expects certain cockpit alert lights to be updated so they can notify crews of potential problems with an automated stall-prevention feature called MCAS. Misfires of that system led to two fatal MAX nose-dives in less than five months, taking 346 lives and resulting in global grounding of the planes in March.
Simulator training typically is used to ensure flight crews understand and can respond appropriately to numerous changes in emergency procedures or alerts.
Since at least early fall, regulators in Europe, Canada and some Asian markets have signaled they are leaning toward mandating extra simulator training as part of their independent reviews of the MAX's safety.
The current tentative timeline projects FAA approval of an ungrounding order around March, after a group of international aviators -- called the Joint Operational Evaluation Board -- is slated to issue comprehensive training recommendations. After that, it would take weeks to inspect the idled planes, complete required maintenance, brief foreign authorities and fly demonstration flights without passengers.
At this point, United Airlines Holdings Inc. has said it is considering voluntarily implementing additional flight-simulator sessions for MAX pilots, though no final decision has been made. The airline has taken the MAX out of its schedules through early June. Airlines could point to such a requirement in their efforts to convince the flying public that the beleaguered airliner is safe. Complicating the FAA's decision is a shortage of functioning 737 MAX simulators.
In response, the FAA, Boeing and airlines are considering installing new software in existing 737 NG simulators so they can better mimic the characteristics of MAX jetliners, according to these officials.
Meanwhile, agency chief Steve Dickson, a former airline captain and safety executive, plans to personally test software fixes and training changes as soon as the end of January or early February.
Separately, a broader internal review of the MAX's design by Boeing, extending well beyond software questions, has uncovered a potential safety problem stemming from the location of certain wire bundles inside the tail.
The spacing of the bundles could cause an electrical short circuit resulting in a possible emergency that would require pilots to respond in as soon as four seconds to prevent the plane from going into a hazardous dive, said people familiar with the details. Information about the wire bundles was reported earlier by the New York Times. Various other MAX systems also have been re-examined since Boeing and the FAA in June revised long-held assumptions about pilot-response times.
An FAA spokesman said the agency will ensure that all safety-related issues identified during the review process are addressed before the MAX is approved for return to passenger service. A Boeing spokesman said the company is working with regulators on a thorough certification process that includes assessing the safety of the wiring bundles.

Texto completo: Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein is headed for trial this week on narrow charges that he sexually assaulted two women. But the trial of the man whose alleged actions helped spawn the #MeToo movement is being closely watched, with cultural implications that go beyond its legal ones.
The sexual-misconduct allegations against Mr. Weinstein, first reported by the New York Times and the New Yorker magazine in 2017, helped release a flood of accusations against other men, many from women who had remained silent for decades. Mr. Weinstein's trial, which is expected to last about two months, is set to begin on Monday in state court in Manhattan. If found guilty, he faces up to life in prison.
Mr. Weinstein, who believes he has been treated unfairly, has repeatedly denied having nonconsensual sex.
Mr. Weinstein has been publicly accused of sexual misconduct by more than 80 women. Inside the courtroom, he faces five criminal counts: two counts of rape, one count of criminal sexual act and two counts of predatory sexual assault, a felony that includes committing sex crimes against multiple people. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges.
The charges revolve around alleged incidents with two women. A former production assistant, Mimi Haleyi, alleges that Mr. Weinstein forced oral sex on her in 2006 at his Manhattan apartment. A second, unnamed accuser says the Hollywood producer raped her at a Manhattan hotel in 2013.
The account of a third woman, "The Sopranos" actress Annabella Sciorra, is expected to be used to bolster a predatory-sexual-assault count. Ms. Sciorra claims Mr. Weinstein raped her in her Manhattan apartment during the early 1990s.
The judge has also allowed testimony from three women who say they were assaulted by Mr. Weinstein but aren't part of the charges. These women are expected to present evidence that prosecutors say will help establish a pattern of behavior. Prosecutors rarely use the tactic because it can unfairly prejudice a jury, though it was employed in the second sexual-assault trial of entertainer Bill Cosby, who was convicted in 2018.
Lawyers for Mr. Weinstein are expected to argue that sex with his accusers was consensual. In legal filings, his former lawyers had suggested that they would use his accusers' text messages and emails to undermine their accounts.
In one message, sent several months after the alleged rape, Ms. Haleyi texted Mr. Weinstein's phone, writing: "Hi! Just wondering if u have any news on whether harvey will have time to see me before he leaves? x Miriam." She signed another message, "Lots of love." A lawyer for Ms. Haleyi didn't respond to a request for comment.
Mr. Weinstein's pivotal role in the #MeToo movement has resulted in outsize cultural interest in the trial.
Supporters of the #MeToo movement are looking to the case for legal affirmation, said Rebecca Roiphe, a New York Law School professor and former Manhattan prosecutor.
"Especially after Epstein's suicide, the left is looking for a legal win, for a situation in which they can say, 'Our cultural movement is going to have a broader effect now because there's a strong message sent from the courtroom,' " Prof. Roiphe said.

Ghosn Taps Airport-Security Hole to Escape

Texto completo: About three months before former auto titan Carlos Ghosn's escape last week from Japan to Lebanon, an operative helping plan his extraction visited Kansai International Airport in Osaka, Japan, and realized there was a huge security hole, according to a person familiar with the matter.
The terminal for private jets was essentially empty, unless there was a flight coming in, this person said. What's more, oversize luggage was too big to fit in the airport scanners.
The security hole proved crucial in Mr. Ghosn's cinema-worthy escape from Japan, where he was out on bail facing charges of financial crimes. He has denied the charges and has previously said he would fight them in court.
The escape involved a 300-mile sprint across Japan, from Mr. Ghosn's court-monitored home in Tokyo to the Osaka airport. He was then smuggled inside a large black box, generally used for concert equipment, with breathing holes drilled in the bottom, into a waiting private jet, as previously reported by The Wall Street Journal.
The plan brought Mr. Ghosn through Turkey, where he changed planes in a predawn rainstorm, and on to Lebanon, where he holds citizenship. Lebanon doesn't extradite its citizens.
On board the plane in Osaka were two U.S. security operatives. One, Michael L. Taylor, is an ex-Green Beret with a history of rescuing hostages.
People familiar with Mr. Ghosn's thinking said he made his own, final decision to go through with the plan only late last month, after signs his trial might drag on for years, and amid the court's refusal for him to have contact with his wife during the holidays.
But work on a detailed plan to extract Mr. Ghosn started months beforehand, according to people familiar with the matter. The planning involved a team of between 10 and 15 people of different nationalities, one of these people said.
In all, the team took more than 20 trips to Japan and visited at least 10 Japanese airports before selecting the Osaka airport as a weak link, this person said.
A spokesman for the airport's operator said its security is no different from other airports in Japan. He said all luggage too large for X-ray scanning is supposed to be opened by security staff, but an airport-security expert said they don't necessarily do so for private-jet travelers as they are considered a lower terrorism risk. Unlike in the U.S., where security is handled by the government, in Japan airlines are responsible for security and use private security companies, the expert said.
Japanese officials said an investigation was under way to determine how Mr. Ghosn fled. Over the weekend, Japan's justice minister said departure checks would be strengthened.
Mr. Ghosn has previously said he arranged his travel to Lebanon on his own, without help from his family.
Arrested in November 2018 on charges of financial crimes related to his time heading Nissan Motor Co., Mr. Ghosn spent weeks in a small cell in Tokyo undergoing daily interrogation by prosecutors without a lawyer present.
Since being released on bail for the second time in April, he has had severe restrictions on contact with his wife and complained bitterly about a Japanese justice system that he felt was stacked against him. Japanese officials defended their system and said he would have received a fair trial.
The escape plan cost in the millions of dollars, according to the person familiar with the matter. In similar rescue missions, the exfiltration team typically would be paid expenses and then a hefty reward upon successful completion, security professionals said.
Also on the private-jet flight from Osaka was George Zayek, a Lebanese-born U.S. citizen who previously worked with Mr. Taylor's Boston-based security company.
Mr. Zayek is the brother of Elias Zayek, one of the founders of the Lebanese Forces militia. Elias Zayek was assassinated in 1990 a few months before the end of the Lebanese civil war. George Zayek was injured in fighting in Lebanon in the 1970s, leaving him with a limp, according to some relatives in Lebanon.
He left for the U.S. in the early 1980s, according to the relatives, and when his brother was killed he spent more time there, eventually becoming a U.S. citizen. He worked in private security with U.S. forces in Afghanistan and Iraq, these relatives said.
The 59-year-old Mr. Taylor's former Boston-based security company was hired by the New York Times to help rescue reporter David Rohde from Taliban captivity in Afghanistan in 2009.
Mr. Taylor recently has told friends he strongly empathized with Mr. Ghosn's legal plight following his own experience with the U.S. criminal-justice system that resulted in prison time.
Mr. Taylor was indicted in 2012 in two criminal cases related to a federal bid-rigging investigation into $54 million in Defense Department contracts. He disputed the charges, and spent 14 months in a local Utah jail under what he considered harsh conditions while awaiting trial. He eventually pleaded guilty to two counts and spent a total of 19 months behind bars.
After learning about Mr. Ghosn's case, Mr. Taylor referred to the embattled auto executive as a "hostage," said one person who knows him.
Mr. Taylor has also worked with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the State Department to rescue overseas kidnapping victims, and in the late 1980s worked four years undercover helping the U.S. government on a drug and money-laundering investigation, according to a sentencing memo by his attorney in his criminal case.
He has strong connections to Lebanon. He was deployed there as a Green Beret in the early 1980s, where he met his wife, and as a private contractor he later trained Lebanese Christian militias, the sentencing memo says. He speaks Arabic.
In 2012, Mr. Taylor was in Lebanon working on a classified case with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration when he was indicted. He flew back to the U.S. and was arrested on arrival in Utah, where the case was prosecuted.
"Mr. Taylor was the key player and critical link in one of the most important DEA operations in history," his lawyer wrote in the later sentencing memo. All but a few words about that operation were redacted in that memo.

U.S. key to climate change battle We should use global influence to battle climate change

Texto completo: The International Monetary Fund estimates fossil fuel subsidies cost the U.S. government $649 billion in 2015, which is more than government spending on the military and 10 times the government spending on education. As the second-largest fossil fuel subsidizer in the world, and largest carbon polluter in history according to the New York Times, the U.S. needs to do its part for the climate by eliminating these subsidies.
Climate change - which National Geographic states is expedited by fossil fuel extraction and usage - is already killing people and our homes. Global warming currently causes some 150,000 deaths each year, a number swiftly rising, according to the World Health Organization. As Congress stands by, experts have published reports stating climate change-caused droughts led to 8.8 million acres burned by wildfires last year and government costs for hurricane damage are $28 billion a year.
The United States has a responsibility to help clean up the mess we have made. Congress can start by ending fossil fuel subsidies and leading the way towards a healthier planet. Our leadership could help encourage the reduction of these subsidies worldwide, which the International Monetary Fund says would decrease carbon emissions by 28 percent.
The United States leads the world through our actions. We need to use this global influence to battle climate change, starting by ending fossil fuel subsidies.
While many say we will not make a difference on our own, as the top contributor to this crisis, we can be the catalyst for worldwide change.

Impeachment is a charge, not a conviction
It is indeed unfortunate that the Press Herald chose to publish George Szok's assertions regarding the ongoing impeachment process.
First, it is emphatically not the House's role to pronounce guilt. Impeachment is not literally a legal process, but the closest analogy to the House's role is that of a grand jury.
A grand jury indicts, that is to say accuses. Thus the House has "accused" Trump of two rather pathetically crafted offenses.
According to the Constitution, their role at this point is over, except for their inevitably futile attempt to convince the Senate, in it's role as jury, that their incredibly inarticulate articles of impeachment merit the Senate's removal of a president.
The assertion that the House role is to determine guilt is flat out wrong, and in fact, is so wrong your paper has done a grave disservice to put that assertion before the public.
As to the merits of their ridiculous allegations meeting the constitutional bar to remove a president, the Senate will quickly dispense with this partisan charade and, yes, will absolve (exonerate) Trump of any wrongdoing.

Can't 'get over' Russian election malfeasance
I can't accept the "get over it" sentiment regarding the 2016 election.
I could accept an election result that was clean and fair. However, there is more than enough evidence to prove that our sacred voting privileges were violated.
We must protect our hard-fought voting rights and results in future local, state and national elections.

Delegation should support carbon bill
Global warming is now a crisis, but there is a way you can help both the planet and your budget. HR 763 would place a fee on carbon-based fuel (gas, oil and coal) and return that money directly and equally to every American. A family of four would get about $288 monthly starting a month before the fees start. This would allow people to afford the estimated 15 cent increase per gallon on gas and oil in the first year . The fee on fossil fuels and the dividend would increase yearly until the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere is reduced adequately to stop global warming.
A recent Citizens Climate Lobby analysis shows that 84 percent of people in Maine's 2nd District would be better off economically after the program starts. This Act would decrease atmospheric CO2 to 31 percent of the 1990 levels by 2030. It would decrease health care costs, air pollution, fires and floods. Some experts think that it could decrease the GDP 0.5 to 1 percent, but economic stimulus from renewables may actually increase the GDP.
Please consider calling Sens. Susan Collins and Angus King, Rep. Pingree (thank her for co-sponsoring) and Rep. Golden and ask them to do all they can to pass HR 763.

Living up to their own low expectations
In the past, when I heard a Republican satirically calling some educationally deficient person "Congress material," I kind of scoffed at his description.
After seeing how some of the Republicans acted during the congressional hearings, maybe there is more truth than poetry to some of those comments.
Impeachment trials notwithstanding, if you condone breaking the law, Donald Trump is your man.

MANAGING HEALTH DIABETES STUDY HIGHLIGHTS NEED FOR AFFORDABLE COVERAGE

Texto completo: It's not the only reason to do it, but a recent study offers one more good argument for making affordable health coverage available to as many Americans as possible.
"Treatment advances in diabetes can meaningfully improve outcomes only if they effectively reach the populations at risk," the authors say in the abstract of their 11-year look at the effectiveness of care for the disease in the United States.
The authors, who published their findings in October in JAMA Internal Medicine, said that only a quarter of the diabetics participating in the study were meeting the four key goals of their treatment.
That's surprising for a number of reasons.
Diabetes is the seventh-leading cause of death in the United States.
And established treatments, lifestyle changes and drugs work to reduce its debilitating effects, which can include blindness, heart attacks, kidney damage and amputations of the feet.
So, what's the problem? If medicine has established proven treatments for reaching healthy outcomes, why are so many diabetics not reducing their cholesterol, lowering their blood pressure, keeping their blood sugar in good control and abstaining from cigarettes?
Three words, according to the study, separate those getting effective care from a majority who are risking diabetes' serious complications: Good health insurance.
"Treatment of diabetes is getting more expensive every day," Pooyan Kazemian of Massachusetts General Hospital, the lead author of the study, told The New York Times. "The newer drugs that control blood sugar with fewer side effects are super expensive, with an average monthly cost of about $1,000, and people without health insurance don't go to the doctor."
Making health insurance affordable and accessible to more Americans is an important goal. The value of getting as many people as possible insured is underlined by the vital role coverage plays in treating diabetes. The disease afflicts more than 300 million Americans and 1.5 million new cases are diagnosed each year, according to the American Diabetes Association.
The Affordable Care Act is the law of the land. It's the framework for our nation's system of private coverage. That system needs to be maintained because it's all we have right now.
Democrats and Republicans in Washington can argue about their big ideas to replace or improve what's in place, but they should take those proposals to the voters.
For now, they should work together on smaller steps toward any health reform's major objectives: getting as many Americans signed up for affordable coverage, a step that would improve the lives of millions. Just as diabetics must manage their disease, Washington needs to take responsibility for maintaining our health system in an effective way.

MCCONNELL MUST AGREE TO A REAL TRIAL

Texto completo: An editorial from The Citizens' Voice (Wilkes-Barre, Pa.)
Trials of all kinds - civil, criminal, impeachment - are supposed to try to get at the truth of the matter at hand. Despite Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's effort to convert the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump into a mere test of party loyalty, new revelations since the House voted to impeach Mr. Trump call for a real trial including witness testimony and documentary evidence.
The House voted Dec. 18 to impeach on two counts, abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. Facts supporting both counts are clear. Mr. Trump withheld congressionally approved military aide for Ukraine and an official state visit for new Ukrainian Prsident Volodymyr Zelenskiy while insisting that Mr. Zelenskiy announce an investigation of a Trump political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden. Then, Mr. Trump clearly hindered Congress as it attempted to carry out its constitutional duty to investigate the president's conduct.
In the ensuing weeks, The Washington Post and The New York Times, using emails among key administration officials, have reconstructed Mr. Trump's decision to withhold the aid against the advice of the Pentagon, the State Department and national security advisers, and the scramble in the White House to concoct a rationale for that decision after it was revealed by a whistleblower in the intelligence community.
More so than ever, it would be a sham for McConnell to attempt to conduct a trial without testimony from key figures in the relevant events, especially former National Security Adviser John Bolton and White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi should continue to refrain from sending the passed articles of impeachment to the Senate for trial until Mr. McConnell agrees to a real trial. And, given the results of the newspapers' continuing inquiries, Ms. Pelosi should continue the House investigations so that the public will know what actually happened, regardless of whether Mr. McConnell continues to promote a charade.

Texto completo: Those of us in journalism primarily do one thing: cover events. We report and opine about events like election campaigns, wars and crimes. A lot of the events we cover are decisions - a decision to reform health care or write a tweet - so we tend to congregate in the cities where decision-makers live. The internet has sped up the news cycle. Now we put more emphasis on covering the last event that just happened. But it's still mostly events.
But a funny thing has happened to events in this era. They have ceased to drive politics the way they used to. We've seen gigantic events like impeachment, the Kavanaugh hearings, the Mueller investigation and the "Access Hollywood" tapes. They come and go and barely leave a trace on the polls, the political landscape or evaluations of Donald Trump.
Events don't seem to be driving politics. Increasingly, sociology is.
Do you want to predict how a certain region is going to vote in the 2020 presidential race? Discover who settled the region in the 17th and 18th centuries. If the settlers were from the East Anglia section of Britain, then that region is probably going Democratic. If the settlers were from the north of Britain, that region is very likely to vote for Donald Trump.
Do you want to predict how a state is going to vote? Find out how that state voted in the 1896 presidential election. As Washington University political scientists Gary Miller and Norman Schofield have observed, 22 of the 23 states that voted Democratic in 1896 had turned Republican by 2000. Similarly, 17 of the 22 states that voted Republican in 1896 had turned Democratic by 2000. The parties have flipped regions.
Do you want to predict how an individual is going to vote? Ask a simple question: Is she urban or rural?
Geographic and psychosociological patterns now overshadow events in driving political loyalties and national electoral outcomes. Demography is destiny.
There's a more precise way to put this. An event is really two things. It's the event itself and then it's the process by which we make meaning of the event. As Aldous Huxley put it, "Experience is not what happens to you, it's what you do with what happens to you."
When a whole country sees events through a similar lens, then you don't have to think a lot about the process people use to make meaning. It's similar across the land. But when people in different regions and subcultures have nonoverlapping lenses, the process by which people make sense of events is more important than the event itself.
For reasons I don't understand, we've had an epistemic explosion over the past few decades. Different American regions and subcultures now see reality through nonoverlapping lenses. They make meaning in radically different ways. Psychosocial categories have hardened.
We in the media will continue to cover events, which, of course, is absolutely necessary. But with some noble exceptions (I'm thinking of Thomas Edsall of The New York Times and Ronald Brownstein of The Atlantic), we underreport on how meaning is made in different subcultures. You can't make sense of reality without that. Often we throw up our hands: "Can't these people see the facts?!?" I'm as guilty as anyone.
In this new context, I'm curious to know how lenses get crafted. For example, intersectionality is a lens that was created by theorists decades ago and is now a way of seeing that many people use to organize their view of reality. How did that happen?
I'm curious to know how a man in rural Idaho who has lost a son to suicide and a brother to fentanyl sees the impeachment hearing. How does he make meaning of that event in real time?
I'm curious to know how you can change another person's lens. Can you do it by writing and talking or do you have to move her to a different place and immerse her in a different reality?
I'm curious to know how power inequality shapes people's lenses. As Jonathan Rauch suggests in the current issue of National Affairs, ideological polarization is not on the rise; emotional polarization is on the rise. We don't necessarily disagree more. We perceive our opponents to be more menacing. We see more fearfully.
The big difference for those of us in media is that the main story is not only where the decision-makers are creating events. It's also and maybe more so in the eyes of those doing the perceiving.
Obviously, in this era it's even more important to have a news organization that is ideologically, culturally and geographically diverse, so you can surface and explore the different unconscious ways groups see.
It's also important to ask different questions. It's not enough to simply ask people's opinions through polls and interviews. Epistemology is deeper than opinions. It's found through deeper probing.
This is a wonderful opportunity for us to think about our jobs in more profound ways. The core insight is that in a hyperpluralistic society you can't know people in other groups until you know how they know you.

Texto completo: U-Haul has become the latest major American employer to stop hiring smokers and other nicotine users.
The policy, which takes effect Feb. 1, won't apply to current employees. It also won't impact U-haul rental locations because workers at those facilities are employed by the locations' owners, not by U-Haul.
Georgia is among the 21 states where such a hiring practice is legal. The company has employees throughout Atlanta, including at a recently opened truck maintenance and regional marketing hub south of Six Flags Over Georgia.
The company's decision makes it only the most recent in a long line of businesses which, beginning in the 1980s, have taken measures to either strongly discourage or outright ban smoking by employees. The trend shows no sign of slowing as restrictions on tobacco use grow more stringent nationwide and public health officials encourage companies to go smoke-free and help workers quit nicotine.
At U-Haul, leaders say the decision was about health.
Companies with such policies can also experience decreased health insurance costs. Some businesses that hire smokers make them pay more for health insurance.
"We are deeply invested in the well-being of our team members," Jessica Lopez, U-Haul chief of staff, said in a written statement. "Nicotine products are addictive and pose a variety of serious health risks. This policy is a responsible step in fostering a culture of wellness at U-Haul, with the goal of helping our team members on their health journey."
A company spokesman was unable Thursday to provide a total number of employees U-Haul has in Georgia. The company employs 30,000 people in the U.S. and Canada.
Other companies beat U-Haul to the punch.
Way back in 1986, Atlanta-based Turner Broadcasting became one of the country's first big employers to stop hiring smokers.
Lockheed Martin in Marietta also stopped hiring smokers in 1994.
But the rules can only be enforced in 21 states. Three decades ago, 29 states and the District of Columbia responded to bans like Turner's by passing laws that prohibit discrimination against smokers.
Those laws had strong backing from tobacco lobbyists and the American Civil Liberties Union at the time, according to The New York Times.
Workers rights groups have called banning smoking a "slippery slope" that could lead to policing other lawful behavior by employees, such as drinking.

Wages Rise At Low End, Gilding Data

Texto completo: Increases in minimum wages across the country may make the labor market look a bit rosier than it really is.
These days, wages in the United States are doing something extraordinary: They're growing faster at the bottom than at the top. In fact, recent growth for workers with low wages has outpaced that for high-wage workers by the widest margin in at least 20 years.
The main story here is the long economic recovery, now entering its 11th year. For much of the early phase of this recovery, wage growth for the bottom group was weaker than for others, but it began gradually accelerating in 2014 as unemployment continued to fall. This was around the same time the labor market started tapping into people some economists had all but given up on as work force participants, such as those who had been citing health reasons or disability for not having a job.
But there has been another factor at play: the rise in state and local minimum wages.
For the last decade, the federal minimum wage has been unchanged at $ 7.25 an hour. But over that period, dozens of states and localities have enacted their own minimum wages or raised existing ones. As a result, the effective U.S. minimum wage is closer to $ 12 an hour, most likely the highest in U.S. history even after adjusting for inflation.
And with two dozen states and four dozen localities set to raise their minimums further in 2020, the effective minimum wage will keep rising this year.
These state and local actions are affecting wage data, especially for workers at the bottom. To get a sense of this impact, I have used data in the Current Population Survey to look at minimum wage workers as a group and calculate the pressure their wage gains have put on aggregate wage growth over time, controlling for compositional changes in the share of minimum wage work.
Note that this approach doesn't settle whether minimum-wage increases are a net benefit to Americans, since among other things wage data will by definition capture only those who stayed employed after an increase. If people were laid off because of a minimum-wage increase, their loss of wages wouldn't factor into the average.
This analysis shows that growth in average wages has been running about 3.9 percent per year in the Current Population Survey over the past two years, a bit firmer than the pace right before the Great Recession but below the near 5 percent reached in 2000.
But increases to minimum wages at the state and local level have put 0.4 percentage points of upward pressure on this recent growth. Absent that pressure, wage growth in the Current Population Survey over the last two years would have been 3.5 percent. That's still a fine result, but it's a bit cooler than the unadjusted data suggest.
Wage pressure from minimum wage workers is magnified when you look at only the lowest wages. That's because while minimum wage work makes up about 6 percent of all usual hours worked, it's around 13 percent of hours worked by Americans in the bottom third of wages.
As the analysis has shown us, wage growth at the bottom is doing well. It has been around 4.1 percent over the last two years -- above the 3.6 percent at the top end, and above the overall average of 3.9 percent.
But absent the pressure from minimum wage workers, growth at the bottom would have been closer to 3.3 percent.
It's important to keep the effect of these minimum wage increases in perspective. The increases aren't responsible for most of the wage growth, or for most of the acceleration in wage growth, during this recovery. Even among the bottom third, minimum wage workers have contributed around a fifth to a quarter of wage growth over the last two years.
As notable as the recent rise in state and local minimum wages has been to this effect, it has probably not been as important as the tightening labor market. In a tight labor market, firms have to compete more to hire and retain the workers they need, which among other things gives those workers more bargaining power to bid up their wages.
The Federal Reserve chair, Jerome Powell, has argued that reaching workers traditionally "left behind" is one of the most compelling reasons to sustain the expansion for as long as possible.
Still, this analysis suggests these minimum-wage increases are having a meaningful impact on wages, at least for the employed workers who benefit from them. For the bottom third, state and local minimum wage increases have probably been the difference between the wage growth just before the economic crisis and the wage growth that is now above that pace.
But that benefit also brings with it a cautionary note for policymakers.
Economists look to wages as one thermometer of how hot the economy is getting: Accelerating wages may eventually spill over into higher prices and signal an economy at capacity, though this hasn't happened yet in this recovery.
But these continuing increases to state and local minimum wages -- and any possible future action at the federal level -- could skew wage data, making the American labor market look tighter than it actually is.
The recent rise in minimum wages, although not producing a giant effect, still might suggest overall wage growth is progressing about a year further along than the reality. For low-wage workers, whom policymakers are citing more often, the minimum wage effect can be worth closer to two years' worth of wage acceleration.
The risk of misdiagnosing an overheating economy is one reason it's important to be clear and precise about what role minimum wage increases have played in recent wage growth: They have been important, but they're most likely not the biggest factor.

Methodology: This analysis defines "minimum wage pressure" as the growth in the effective minimum wage -- the average binding federal, state or local minimum wage received per hour of minimum wage work -- over 12 months, weighted by the share of minimum wage work at the beginning of the 12-month period. In a shift-share framework, this is the equivalent of the compositionally adjusted contribution to aggregate wage growth from minimum wage workers.
The analysis uses average hourly wages for private nonfarm wage and salary workers calculated from the Current Population Survey Outgoing Rotation Group. It takes hourly wages as given when available for hourly workers; for others, it divides usual weekly earnings by usual weekly hours. The analysis imputes usual hours when unavailable or varying, and adjusts weekly earnings for top-coding using a log-linear distributional assumption. It also trims outlier hourly wages. Despite these adjustments, wages in the C.P.S. invariably differ from average hourly earnings reported in the Current Employment Statistics, another Bureau of Labor Statistics data source for wages, because of differences in scope, design and concept.
The analysis uses the same methodology for calculating state and local minimum wages, and for identifying minimum wage workers, as in a previous analysis from April 2019.

Texto completo: Between the 1960s and the 1980s, Louis Silverstein, a bold art director for The Times, introduced new graphic design elements that continue to shape the appearance of the paper today.
Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
If you were to pick up a copy of The New York Times in 1960, you would have mostly seen dense pillars of words. Sentences would have been packed tightly, like commuters on a busy subway car.
The Times was, as its nickname suggests, the Gray Lady.
But over the next two decades, that began to change. A bold art director, Louis Silverstein, emphasized graphic design elements that have since become standard industry practice. More white space appeared and the photos got bigger.
Working during a period of cultural, technological and economic shifts, he transformed The Times into a paper that took design as seriously as it did text in its journalism, and he helped to establish the role of the art director as a key player in the newsroom. By 1984, the paper was respected for its design by industry experts.
"It was trying to change from the 'old gray lady' to a more vibrant newspaper," said Steven Heller, a former art director for The Times who teaches design at the School of Visual Arts.
In 1967, Mr. Silverstein -- then the corporate art director -- changed the body typeface of the paper from Ideal to Imperial and increased the size of the text. As the art director of the newsroom in 1976, he implemented a more dramatic shift by decreasing the number of columns across the paper from eight to six, which made it easier to read.
"From a design angle, the main consideration was making the paper more accessible," Mr. Heller said.
Behind the scenes, The Times faced a significant corporate restructuring that would give the newsroom legs to experiment. In 1969, The New York Times Company went public, and a few years later the company broadened profits by purchasing television stations, magazines and other newspapers. Under A.M. Rosenthal, the executive editor, the art department became part of the newsroom for the first time, with Mr. Silverstein leading it. The company began to explore new types of journalism to reach readers in this age of expansion.
"We were competing with television," Mr. Heller said. "There was the beginning of the short attention span, which people complain about today."
The paper later introduced new sections, including SportsMonday, ScienceTimes on Tuesday and the Weekend Arts section, that were heavily influenced by lifestyle magazines.
"There were people that felt that The Times had to change with the times," Mr. Heller said. "There were other people that felt that the changes being made editorially were hurting the reputation of the paper."
In 1978, The Times also switched from hot type to cold type: the most significant change in newspaper production in a century. In the days of hot type, teams of technicians operated linotype machines and hand-placed the text line by line. The new system used lasers to transfer the text onto photosensitive paper in a process called photocomposition, which gave the designers more control over the type.
"Cold type allowed us to play a little more," Mr. Heller said.
Infographics, which used visual elements to explain complex topics, also became a regular feature in the newspaper. Mr. Silverstein called these "sides of beef," named for the diagram of a cow often posted in butcher shops that identifies different cuts of meat. In 1981, the coverage of the spaceship Columbia's maiden flight featured a combination of graphs, diagrams, timelines and flight paths, while previously that story might have been told only in words.
"The reader could have both a visual and reading experience," Mr. Heller said. "It would have been possible with hot type, but it wouldn't have been as easy and fluid."
Many of these innovations opened the door for a more integrated approach to text and visuals, and both are now seen as key to understanding the news.
"We're using elements from the Lou Silverstein era and applying them to 2019," said Fred Bierman, director of news design for the News Print Hub. "And we try to keep it looking like The New York Times."

Texto completo: Readers discuss the importance of involving ordinary citizens in the rehabilitation effort.
To the Editor:
Re "How to Fix Our Prisons? Let the Public Inside" (Op-Ed, Dec. 18):
Neil Barsky is right when he writes that the way to fix prisons is to let the public inside them. When I ran juvenile corrections for Washington, D.C., we invited in a raft of outsiders. Georgetown students came every week to visit and tutor, as did a theatrical group from the University of the District of Columbia.
Both a parents' advocacy group and the Public Defenders Service had offices inside the locked perimeter of the facility. I put the private, nonprofit Maya Angelou Academy in charge of educating the young people, and school officials extended school into the evening and on Saturdays so that the young people who were behind in credits could catch up, often using volunteers to augment paid staff.
The police and victims' groups worked with the young people to design artwork made from disabled guns confiscated during arrests. A group of formerly incarcerated people provided regular mentorship. We even held a mayoral debate inside the facility moderated by the young people.
Each crack in the previously impenetrable juvenile prison gates helped normalize the young people's experience and humanize them. Mr. Barsky's proposal to take that kind of approach nationwide deserves serious consideration.

To the Editor:
As a volunteer with one of the organizations Neil Barsky cites, Rehabilitation Through The Arts, I have been going "inside" for four years now, facilitating theater workshops. I have seen firsthand the benefits of such efforts as I watch graduates of our program thrive and contribute to society after their release from prison.
Before starting this work I, like most people, had no idea what went on behind the walls, nor did I have much interest. I now see that it is in society's best interest to support and expand such programs. The men and women with whom we work learn skills and values many may not have had the opportunity to learn before landing in prison.
The recidivism rate of people who participate in programs like ours is far lower than the general prison population. This means that they are not repeating their mistakes (the people I have worked with fully own their actions and take full responsibility for them). And this means that society is safer.
Would it not be we who benefited by seeing more rehabilitative programs offered so that additional people are not the victims of crime?

To the Editor:
I support Neil Barsky's suggestions for prison life reform through the "Let Us In" movement. College graduates could work with incarcerated men and women in exchange for student debt relief.

Texto completo: The president threatened Iran over potential retaliation for the death of a top general, and Iraq over the potential expulsion of United States troops.
WASHINGTON -- President Trump on Sunday evening doubled down on his claim that he would target Iranian cultural sites if Iran retaliated for the targeted killing of one of its top generals, and threatened "very big sanctions" on Iraq if American troops are forced to leave the country.
Aboard Air Force One on his way back from his holiday trip to Florida, Mr. Trump reiterated to reporters the spirit of a Twitter post on Saturday, when he said the United States government had identified 52 sites for retaliation against Iran if there were a response to Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani's death. Some, he tweeted, were of "cultural" significance.
Such a move could be considered a war crime under international laws, but Mr. Trump said Sunday that he was undeterred.
"They're allowed to kill our people. They're allowed to torture and maim our people. They're allowed to use roadside bombs and blow up our people," the president said. "And we're not allowed to touch their cultural site? It doesn't work that way."
The remarks came just hours after the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, walked back Mr. Trump's tweets and said that whatever was done in any military engagement with Iran would be within the bounds of the law.
Mr. Trump also sounded fatalistic about the possibility of an Iranian escalation.
"If it happens, it happens," he said. "If they do anything, there will be major retaliation"
As the president spoke, six advisers crowded to the side of Mr. Trump's desk in the cabin, near the doorway: Robert O'Brien, his national security adviser; Jared Kushner, his son-in-law and senior adviser; Ivanka Trump, his daughter and senior adviser; Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff; Hogan Gidley, a deputy press secretary; and Dan Scavino, the White House social media director. The president had a football game on the television affixed to the wall.
Mr. Trump also vowed to impose sanctions on Iraq if a move to evict American military personnel from the country takes place, a possibility heightened by the Iraqi Parliament's passage Sunday of a measure to expel foreign troops in response to the killing of General Suleimani. That strike took place in Iraq, in a move that officials saw as violating the country's sovereignty.
"We have a very extraordinarily expensive air base that's there," Mr. Trump said of Iraq. "It cost billions of dollars to build. Long before my time. We're not leaving unless they pay us back for it."
Mr. Trump then escalated his language, saying: "If they do ask us to leave, if we don't do it in a very friendly basis, we will charge them sanctions like they've never seen before ever. It'll make Iranian sanctions look somewhat tame."
"If there's any hostility, that they do anything we think is inappropriate, we are going to put sanctions on Iraq, very big sanctions on Iraq," Mr. Trump added.
In making his warning, the president was threatening sanctions on a country for forcing out American troops whom he himself had pledged to bring home during his 2016 presidential campaign.
The threat also underscored the growing fallout from the president's decision regarding General Suleimani.
The president said in tweets and in a statement on Friday about the strike that General Suleimani's "reign of terror" was over, and he spoke about the hundreds of deaths for which the commander was responsible.
Officials have said the United States was retaliating against Iran, first for the death of an American contractor, and then for attacks at the American Embassy in Iraq led by pro-Iranian forces.
Officials have also said they had intelligence that General Suleimani was involved in planning "imminent" attacks on American interests in other countries, a statement that some government officials have questioned.
Mr. Trump told reporters that he might discuss making some of the intelligence available to a skeptical public nearly 17 years after the war in Iraq began on the basis of intelligence that proved not to be credible.
Mr. Trump also insisted he had been personally tracking General Suleimani for about 18 months. "He was leading his country down a very bad, dangerous path," he said.

Texto completo: To the Editor:
Re "Democrats May Save Us Yet," by Paul Krugman (column, Dec. 20):
If American democracy is to survive, it's imperative that voters who stayed home or who couldn't abide Hillary Clinton -- even for the singular purpose of opposing Donald Trump -- rethink the wisdom of their decision.
While it's still unknown who the Democratic nominee in 2020 will be, there isn't the slightest question that Donald Trump will stop at nothing to remain in office.
It's our collective responsibility to prevent that from happening. Choosing the lesser of two evils may feel depressing. Would an indefinite future in a totalitarian state feel better?

Texto completo: The best stories that you might have missed.
Each week, we review the week's news , offering analysis about the most important developments in the tech industry.
Hi, everyone, this is Nellie Bowles, a tech writer for The New York Times in San Francisco. And I'm here to let you in on a sad truth.
Sometimes news breaks that is more exciting or terrifying or compelling for whatever reason than our beautiful articles about tech. Maybe the article was a long feature that came out right after the impeachment vote. Maybe it was a carefully wrought profile that coincided with Jeffrey Epstein's death. Whatever the reason, when there is big, surprising news, there is always, in some other corner of The Times, a reporter quietly heartbroken over the realization that her or his article is now at the bottom of the heap.
So in this newsletter, I will quickly run down the news of a slow news week (it's New Year's!). And then we will take a tour through the hidden gems produced by my co-workers in 2019.
The Week's Recap
Brian Chen laid out what new tech to expect in 2020 (better home automation, more wearables). And Kevin Roose chose his annual Good Tech Award winners.
California's new law to regulate freelance work is upsetting a lot of freelancers, as I reported with my colleague Noam Scheiber, who followed with news that Uber and Postmates filed a lawsuit to stop it. A new California law on privacy is also creating dismay, though in a different way: Few companies agree on what the law means, Natasha Singer wrote.
SoftBank, famous these days for its investments in overhyped start-ups, faces trouble in India for funding Oyo, a start-up with a noxious work environment, Vindu Goel and Karan Deep Singh wrote.
The Hidden Gems From 2019
The day after Robert Mueller's congressional testimony, Steve Lohr came out with an article on how the personal data held by tech companies is not just a privacy concern but a wealth and power concentration concern, too.
Consumers are often unaware of the many uses of their data. So far, privacy concerns have been the main focus of scrutiny. But the attention of lawmakers is starting to turn to the concentration of data wealth in the hands of a few companies.
The morning after the House impeachment vote, Karen Weise published an investigation into how Amazon controls the many businesses that rely on it.
"Some guy we had never talked to gave us a call and was like, 'We have changed the rules,"' said Charlie Cole, who runs Tumi's online business. He pushed back, but wasn't successful. "It was like talking to a brick wall," he said. "They want to be able to control everything."
Cade Metz went to Bhubaneswar, India, to show the lives of the people who are training computers to replace people. He wrote a nuanced, human piece that reveals the frenzy of work behind algorithms that seem seamless.
In facilities like the one I visited in Bhubaneswar and in other cities in India, China, Nepal, the Philippines, East Africa and the United States, tens of thousands of office workers are punching a clock while they teach the machines.
Jack Nicas and Keith Collins exposed the way Apple's algorithms kept Apple services ranked high in the App Store. Midway through the reporting, the algorithm changed. Apple representatives told Jack that the change was not an admission of wrongdoing but a way to handicap themselves to make it easier for their competitors.
If you searched for "podcast" in May 2018, you would have had to scroll through as many as 14 Apple apps before finding one made by another publisher.
Just as the holidays were kicking off, Adam Satariano had a tale from the Faroe Islands, "At the Edge of the World, a New Battleground for the U.S. and China." The photos by Ben Quinton are especially stunning.
No location is now too small for the United States and China to focus on as they tussle over the future of technology. The Faroe Islands, whose proximity to the arctic gives it added military importance, joins countries across Europe caught in the middle of the two superpowers over Huawei, the crown jewel of the Chinese tech sector.
Davey Alba, the tech team's new reporter on disinformation, wrote about how Facebook's chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, told Congress that the company would share a huge amount of data related to disinformation. It didn't happen as promised.
As a result, researchers say, the public may have little more insight into disinformation campaigns on the social network heading into the 2020 presidential election than they had in 2016.
During summer's long vacation-filled months, Brian Chen wrote a confessional: "I Shared My Phone Number. I Learned I Shouldn't Have."
For most of our lives, we have been conditioned to share our phone numbers with businesses and acquaintances without hesitation. In August, I learned this was a bad idea.
Natasha Singer profiled Baroness Beeban Kidron, a member of Britain's House of Lords who is fighting Big Tech on behalf of children's privacy.
"The idea that it's O.K. to nudge kids into endless behaviors, just because you are pushing their evolutionary buttons -- it's not a fair fight," Lady Kidron told me, as she sat a few tables away from a Facebook policy executive. "It's little Timmy in his bedroom versus Mark Zuckerberg in his Valley."
And last but not least, Daisuke Wakabayashi profiled Luigi Zingales, a professor from the famously free-market University of Chicago who is now leading calls for regulating tech.
"My conclusions may surprise some people who identify Chicago faculty, especially the economic and financial faculty, with a certain ideology. Chicago faculty, however, abide to a method, not an ideology," Mr. Zingales said.
Happy New Year! May all your best work go viral in 2020, if only in your heart.

Texto completo: Howard Polskin woke up the day after President Trump's election with a powerful feeling that he had missed something important.
'I thought I was a smart guy, but I felt very dumb on Nov. 9, 2016,' he told me.
Polskin, a former journalist and then a public relations executive, realized that the way he was staying informed " sources including 'the New York Times, Time magazine, the NBC News with Lester Holt' " may have been giving him the facts but they weren't giving him a worldview shared by millions of Americas.
They were the millions who elected Trump.
Not long afterward, Polskin began a website and newsletter called TheRighting. The newsletter's tagline: 'Top News Headlines from the Far Right for the Rest of Us.'
For those who get their news from traditional, mainstream sources, it can be a five-day-a-week visit to another planet as it aggregates articles from right-wing sites and measures the audience of those sites.
'Because media is so bifurcated, I find it helpful to check in with the other media universe,' said one of the site's regular readers, Daily Beast editor-at-large Molly Jong-Fast. 'It's weird how different the two worlds are.'
Weird indeed.
Take the demise of the Newseum, the recently shuttered Pennsylvania Avenue museum devoted to journalism.
If you became aware of its closing from mainstream sources, you might come away with one of these two ideas: It's regrettable that an institution that celebrates the First Amendment had to close because of financial difficulties. Or: The place was foolishly overbuilt and unrealistic from the start, an exercise in hubris, though for a good cause. (You might even be ticked off that the Newseum store once sold 'Fake News' souvenirs.)
If you happened to read TheRighting, you'd get a blast of something quite different.
The headline of an article from Communities Digital News was just the start: 'Fake Newseum Closes Its Door. Trump Still President.' The article called the Newseum 'a museum dedicated to elitist arrogance . . . an institution designed to promote the promoters of lies, Democratic Party disinformation and general leftist nonsense.'
You might not like it or agree with that " I certainly don't " but it's the hint of a pervasive worldview.
And that's what Polskin had in mind. (He is, of course, not the first or the only one to do this work; some news organizations have reporters whose whole beat is covering right-wing media; and " among others " Will Sommer's Right Richter newsletter has long been an important source of similar information.)

'I did this as a passion project,' said Polskin, who once covered network news from TV Guide's New York bureau, and who worked at Sony and CNN before starting his own public relations company.
Not to make money (it doesn't) but 'to inform people in the center and on the left.'
In circulating the right-wing news, Polskin doesn't try to fact-check or correct. And he understands there can be a downside since what he aggregates and shares may be racist, anti-science or flat-out false.
'I'm amplifying the message. I'm painfully aware of that,' he told me. He said he does draw a line " for example, he refuses to circulate stories from the Daily Stormer, the neo-Nazi website, despite their popularity and what they might say about the media ecosystem.
At the same time, he finds at least some of what he aggregates to be compellingly written and well argued.
In keeping track of the metrics of right-wing media, Polskin has noticed some overarching trends.
Most notable: the inexorable growth of Fox News's digital operation, foxnews.com. Those who think of Fox's influence as mostly from its television network, Polskin said, are missing a huge development.

Another: the rise in audience size and influence of the Washington Examiner, the conservative website and weekly printed magazine, founded in 2005 by billionaire Philip Anschutz and based in Washington.
On Friday, as mainstream news organizations grappled with the stunning news that an American airstrike had killed a top Iranian commander in Baghdad, the need for skepticism and caution needed to be top-of-mind for journalists and the public.
Not everyone remembered " or chose to recall " the media-driven rush to a disastrous war in Iraq more than 15 years ago.
TheRighting, though, was reflecting what many Americans were receiving from their information sources: pro-Trump cheerleading.
'Why Trump didn't need congressional approval to kill Qasem Soleimani,' opined the headline of a Tom Rogan piece in the Examiner.
'Trump Was Right to Order Killing of Soleimani,' applauded Fox News. ('It will make America safer.')
Polskin's efforts have baffled his more liberal friends: 'They think I've gone off the deep end.'
But he's convinced " just as he was on Nov. 9, 2016 " that it's important to understand how a sizable section of the country is forming its views.
'To be an educated person in America, you have to know what's being said on the right.'

Texto completo: After his decision to kill a general, allies were quick to blast his predecessor
As President Trump's allies rushed to defend his decision to authorize a drone strike that killed Iran's top military commander, many have focused less on Qasem Soleimani than another once-prominent actor in Middle East affairs: former president Barack Obama.
'Obama drew red lines - ignored them,' Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) wrote in a tweet, adding that Trump 'never will.'
'There is a NEW Sheriff in town,' proclaimed former Milwaukee sheriff David A. Clarke Jr., a vocal Trump surrogate. 'Maybe they thought Obama was still the Commander in Chief.'
House Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) recycled a misleading claim that Obama had been 'sending Iran pallets of cash as they killed Americans.' But with Trump in charge, he added, 'America fights back.'
For Trump, the true measure of the dramatic and risky military operation will become clear over time, as the United States braces for a potential retaliatory strike from Iran that could embroil his administration in the kind of complex and intractable Middle East conflict he had pledged to avoid. But amid the immediate fallout from Soleimani's death, the president and his defenders rushed to declare that Trump had bested his predecessor in standing up to a malign foreign power.
To Trump's allies, the killing of Soleimani didn't just eliminate Iran's chief military strategist, it was a 'bigger deal than Osama bin Laden,' according to Ryan Fournier, co-chairman of Students for Trump. The al-Qaeda mastermind of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks was killed in a Navy SEAL raid in 2011 " one of Obama's top national security accomplishments.
The boastful tone aimed to grant Trump a measure of validation and credit at a time of enormous political vulnerability amid an ongoing impeachment proceeding. But it also served to rebut criticism over Trump's move in 2018 to abandon the Iran nuclear deal that the Obama administration negotiated three years earlier. The decision fulfilled a chief Trump campaign promise but exacerbated tensions between Washington and Tehran and, experts said, helped lead to the escalating crisis punctuated by the drone strike on Soleimani.
Trump, former aides said, has burned with a desire to erase Obama's foreign policy legacy and prove himself a superior commander in chief.
'For whatever reason, President Trump has fixated on President Obama, and I think that he views President Obama as the metric he has to beat,' said Fernando Cutz, who served on the National Security Council under both presidents, including a stint as senior adviser to H.R. McMaster, Trump's second national security adviser.
McMaster and other top aides, including former secretary of state Rex Tillerson, had strenuously lobbied Trump to stay in the deal that imposed limits on Iran's program to build a nuclear weapon in exchange for economic sanctions relief. But that effort ultimately failed and, Cutz said, and helped cost McMaster his White House job.
Trump moved to nullify the deal because it 'was a campaign promise and an Obama deal " every time he extended an Obama deal, he was inherently admitting it was a good deal. His whole thing was that it was a horrible deal,' Cutz said. He added that in meetings with his national security advisers, Trump groused that he should be awarded a Nobel Peace Prize and complained that Obama received one for campaigning against nuclear weapons before taking office.
After news of Soleimani's death emerged late Thursday, Trump allies took to social media to debate with Obama administration veterans, who pronounced the drone strike a reckless and ill-advised act of war that would almost certainly backfire.
Ben Rhodes, Obama's former deputy national security adviser for strategic communications, questioned Trump's ability to handle a 'complex, enduring, international crisis,' prompting conservative pundit Ben Shapiro to mock Rhodes as 'a failed novelist who openly lied to the American people while pushing bribery of a terrorist regime to handle this.' It was a reference to a 2016 profile of Rhodes in the New York Times Magazine in which he boasted of using inexperienced reporters to shape a 'narrative' and create a favorable public impression around the Iran deal.
The Trump campaign retweeted a post from Michael Joyce, a Republican National Committee spokesman, juxtaposing an image of Iranian officials mourning Soleimani's death with one of U.S. sailors aboard a Navy command boat captured by Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps after entering Iranian waters in 2016.
'US-Iran relations under Obama vs. US-Iran relations under @realDonaldTrump,' Joyce wrote.
'I don't think it's too much of a stretch to say the root of much of this is Obama envy,' said Ned Price, a former CIA officer who served as an NSC spokesman under Obama. 'It was Trump's determination, honed over a year on the campaign trail and the first 1 1/2 years of his administration, to rail against the Iran deal, Obama's deal, the 'worst deal ever.' He got raucous applause and cheers from his base when he associated it with Obama, and that was a decisive factor in Trump's decision to abandon it in 2018.'
It wasn't just the Iran deal that Trump jettisoned. His administration has begun withdrawing the United States from the Paris climate accord; scrapped Obama's agreement to enter a trans-Pacific trade pact; reversed efforts to warm relations with Cuba and dropped Obama's 'strategic patience' strategy to isolate North Korea, instead engaging directly with leader Kim Jong Un.
Trump did not mention Obama in brief remarks about the Soleimani operation Friday. But days earlier " as an Iraqi militia aligned with the Iranian general breached security at the heavily fortified U.S. Embassy in Baghdad in protest of an American strike on the group's facilities in Syria and Iraq " Trump made a clear reference to his predecessor by threatening Iran over the incident and declaring the situation the 'Anti-Benghazi' on Twitter.
He was alluding to a siege on a U.S. diplomatic compound in Libya in 2012 in which two Americans, including Ambassador Christopher Stephens, were killed " a tragedy for which Republicans faulted Obama's administration for not securing the facility and for a muddied public accounting of what happened.
Robert Spalding, a retired Air Force general who served on Trump's NSC, discounted the notion that the president's actions this week were motivated by a sense of grievance over Obama's legacy. Spalding called Soleimani a longtime threat to U.S. national security who should have been targeted by Obama and his predecessor, George W. Bush.
'Those who want to tie it to a broader agenda over differences with Obama's policies I think is a stretch,' he said.
But Trump's intensive focus on Obama was apparent long before he launched his White House campaign in 2015. Trump was a leading proponent of the racist 'birther' conspiracy theory, which falsely accused Obama of being an illegitimate president who was born outside the United States.
In April 2011, on the night Obama authorized the raid that killed bin Laden, Trump was the target of numerous jokes by Obama at the White House correspondents' dinner in Washington.
Trump has also falsely accused Obama of ordering his administration to wiretap the phones at Trump Tower during his campaign and transition in an effort to tie him to a Russian interference operation in the 2016 election.
Trump's fixation with Obama has grown more acute over his three years in office. The president mentioned Obama 537 times in the first 10 months of 2019 " a 36 percent increase from the same period in 2018 and up 169 percent from that time frame in 2017, according to an analysis from Daniel Dale, a CNN analyst and fact-checker.
Some past presidents have been disdainful of their predecessors, said Rice University historian Douglas Brinkley. He cited Franklin D. Roosevelt's temporary name change for the Herbert Hoover Dam in Nevada back to Boulder Dam and Ronald Reagan's removal of solar panels installed at the White House by Jimmy Carter.
But there has been nothing comparable to Trump's relentless trashing of Obama, Brinkley said.
'Trump likes the fact that attacking Obama, as an African American president, helped him with the right wing of the Republican Party that he needed,' he said.
After Trump's embrace of the birther conspiracy theory, Brink ley added, 'he needs to show Obama was a really bad president with socialist tendencies to kind of justify his attacks on him. The wiretapping " he fabricates things Obama did to turn him into an all-purpose nemesis. There's been belittling of a predecessor before " but not this sense of a mass destruction of a reputation.'

Texto completo: About three months before former auto titan Carlos Ghosn's escape last week from Japan to Lebanon , an operative helping plan his extraction visited Kansai International Airport in Osaka, Japan, and realized there was a huge security hole, according to a person familiar with the matter.
The terminal for private jets was quieter than those at most other airports and essentially empty, unless there was a flight coming in, this person said. What's more, oversize luggage was too big to fit in the airport scanners.
The security hole proved crucial in Mr. Ghosn's cinema-worthy escape from Japan, where he was out on bail facing charges of financial crimes. He has denied the charges and has previously said he would fight them in court.
The escape involved a 300-mile sprint across Japan, from Mr. Ghosn's court-monitored home in Tokyo to the Osaka airport. He was then smuggled inside a large black box, generally used for concert equipment, with breathing holes drilled in the bottom, into a waiting private jet, as previously reported by The Wall Street Journal.

What part of this story do you find most interesting—and where would you like to learn more? Join the conversation below.
The plan brought Mr. Ghosn through Turkey, where he changed planes in a predawn rainstorm, and on to Lebanon, where he holds citizenship. Lebanon doesn't extradite its citizens.
On board the plane in Osaka were two U.S. security operatives. One, Michael L. Taylor, is an ex-Green Beret with a history of rescuing hostages.
People familiar with Mr. Ghosn's thinking said he made his own, final decision to go through with the plan only late last month, after signs his trial might drag on for years, and amid the court's refusal for him to have contact with his wife during the holidays.
But work on a detailed plan to extract Mr. Ghosn started months beforehand, according to people familiar with the matter. The planning involved a team of between 10 and 15 people of different nationalities, one of these people said.
In all, the team took more than 20 trips to Japan and visited at least 10 Japanese airports before selecting the Osaka airport as a weak link, this person said.
A spokesman for the airport's operator said its security is no different from other airports in Japan. He said all luggage too large for X-ray scanning is supposed to be opened by security staff, but an airport-security expert said they don't necessarily do so for private-jet travelers as they are considered a lower terrorism risk. Unlike in the U.S., where security is handled by the government, in Japan airlines are responsible for security and use private security companies, the expert said.
Japanese officials said an investigation was under way to determine how Mr. Ghosn fled. Over the weekend, Japan's justice minister said departure checks would be strengthened.
Mr. Ghosn has previously said he arranged his travel to Lebanon on his own, without help from his family.
Arrested in November 2018 on charges of financial crimes related to his time leading Nissan Motor Co., Mr. Ghosn spent months in a small cell in Tokyo undergoing regular interrogation by prosecutors without a lawyer present.
Since being released on bail for the second time in April, he has had severe restrictions on contact with his wife and complained bitterly about a Japanese justice system that he felt was stacked against him. Japanese officials defended their system and said he would have received a fair trial.
The escape plan cost in the millions of dollars, according to the person familiar with the matter. In similar rescue missions, the exfiltration team typically would be paid expenses and then a hefty reward upon successful completion, security professionals said.
Also on the private-jet flight from Osaka was George Zayek, a Lebanese-born U.S. citizen who previously worked with Mr. Taylor's Boston-based security company.
Mr. Zayek is the brother of Elias Zayek, one of the founders of the Lebanese Forces militia. Elias Zayek was assassinated in 1990 a few months before the end of the Lebanese civil war. George Zayek was injured in fighting in Lebanon in the 1970s, leaving him with a limp, according to some relatives in Lebanon.
He left for the U.S. in the early 1980s, according to the relatives, and when his brother was killed he spent more time there, eventually becoming a U.S. citizen. He worked in private security with U.S. forces in Afghanistan and Iraq, these relatives said.
The 59-year-old Mr. Taylor's former Boston-based security company was hired by the New York Times to help rescue reporter David Rohde from Taliban captivity in Afghanistan in 2009.
Mr. Taylor recently has told friends he strongly empathized with Mr. Ghosn's legal plight following his own experience with the U.S. criminal-justice system that resulted in prison time.
Mr. Taylor was indicted in 2012 in two criminal cases related to a federal bid-rigging investigation into $54 million in Defense Department contracts. He disputed the charges, and spent 14 months in a local Utah jail under what he considered harsh conditions while awaiting trial. He eventually pleaded guilty to two counts and spent a total of 19 months behind bars.
After learning about Mr. Ghosn's case, Mr. Taylor referred to the embattled auto executive as a "hostage," said one person who knows him.

Mr. Taylor has also worked with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the State Department to rescue overseas kidnapping victims, and in the late 1980s worked four years undercover helping the U.S. government on a drug and money-laundering investigation, according to a sentencing memo by his attorney in his criminal case.
He has strong connections to Lebanon. He was deployed there as a Green Beret in the early 1980s, where he met his wife, and as a private contractor he later trained Lebanese Christian militias, the sentencing memo says. He speaks Arabic.
In 2012, Mr. Taylor was in Lebanon working on a classified case with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration when he was indicted. He flew back to the U.S. and was arrested on arrival in Utah, where the case was prosecuted.
"Mr. Taylor was the key player and critical link in one of the most important DEA operations in history," his lawyer wrote in the later sentencing memo. All but a few words about that operation were redacted in that memo.

U.S. Regulators Mull Ordering Extra Simulator Training for Boeing 737 MAX Pilots; FAA earlier rejected such training mandates

Texto completo: Boeing has long maintained 737 MAX pilots don't need supplemental simulator training beyond what pilots receive to fly other 737 models. PHOTO: Andriana Mereuta for The Wall Street Journal
Federal aviation regulators are considering mandatory flight-simulator training before U.S. pilots can operate Boeing Co.'s 737 MAX jets again, according to government and industry officials familiar with the deliberations, a change that would repudiate one of the plane maker's longstanding arguments.
The Federal Aviation Administration months ago rejected the idea—which would entail extra costs and delays for airlines—as unnecessary. But in recent weeks, these officials said, requiring such training before returning the grounded U.S. MAX fleet to the air has gained momentum among agency and industry safety experts.
"The deliberations appear headed for a much different direction than before," according to one of the officials, who described increased FAA emphasis on the topic.
The FAA's formal decision isn't expected until February or later, and the situation remains fluid. An agency spokeswoman declined to comment on specifics, saying more analysis and testing is required.
"The FAA does not have a timeline for this process," she said. "And at this point our primary concern is ensuring a complete and thorough review of the aircraft."
A Boeing spokesman said: "We are thoroughly evaluating all aspects of a safe return to service including pilot training, procedures and checklists." He added that Boeing will follow the recommendations of regulators world-wide and its priority is supplying any information they seek.
Boeing has long maintained 737 MAX pilots don't need supplemental simulator training beyond what pilots receive to fly other 737 models, a stance that many FAA officials now regard with increasing skepticism, according to the officials.
The FAA's changed outlook on simulator training has arisen partly because Boeing and regulators are proposing rewriting some emergency checklists for pilots and creating some new ones, according to some of these officials.
In addition, one of these officials said, the FAA expects certain cockpit alert lights to be updated so they can notify crews of potential problems with an automated stall-prevention feature called MCAS. Misfires of that system led to two fatal MAX nosedives in less than five months, taking 346 lives and resulting in global grounding of the planes in March.
Simulator training typically is used to ensure flight crews understand and can respond appropriately to numerous changes in emergency procedures or alerts.
Since at least early fall, regulators in Europe, Canada and some Asian markets have signaled they are leaning toward mandating extra simulator training as part of their independent reviews of the MAX's safety.
The current tentative timeline projects FAA approval of an ungrounding order around March, after a group of international aviators—called the Joint Operational Evaluation Board—is slated to issue comprehensive training recommendations. After that, it would take weeks to inspect the idled planes, complete required maintenance tasks, brief foreign authorities and fly demonstration flights without passengers.
At this point, United Airlines Holdings Inc. has said it is considering voluntarily implementing additional flight-simulator sessions for MAX pilots, though no final decision has been made. The airline has taken the MAX out of its schedules through early June. Airlines could point to such a requirement in their efforts to convince the flying public that the beleaguered airliner is safe, some of the officials said.
Complicating the FAA's decision is an industrywide shortage of functioning 737 MAX simulators.
In response, the FAA, Boeing and airlines are considering installing new software in existing 737 NG simulators so they can better mimic the characteristics of MAX jetliners, according to these officials.
Meanwhile, agency chief Steve Dickson, a former airline captain and safety executive, plans to personally test software fixes and training changes as soon as the end of January or early February.
A year ago, when the FAA was analyzing earlier versions of MCAS fixes, Boeing argued strongly against upfront simulator requirements. The company said in a letter to the agency that differences between 737 NG and MAX models relating to the MCAS software "do not affect pilot knowledge, skills, abilities or flight safety." At the time, FAA and Boeing officials tentatively agreed on training sessions that aviators could perform by themselves on tablets or laptop computers.
The correspondence was released in October by the House Transportation Committee, which continues to investigate safety problems that have bedeviled the MAX, along with the FAA's oversight of the plane's initial design and subsequent proposed fixes.
Separately, a broader internal review of the MAX's design by Boeing, extending well beyond software questions, has uncovered a potential safety problem stemming from the location of certain wire bundles inside the tail.
The spacing of the bundles could cause an electrical short circuit resulting in a possible emergency that would require pilots to respond in as soon as four seconds to prevent the plane from going into a hazardous dive, said people familiar with the details. Information about the wire bundles was reported earlier by the New York Times. Various other MAX systems also have been re-examined since Boeing and the FAA in June revised long-held assumptions about pilot-response times.
An FAA spokesman said the agency will ensure that all safety related issues identified during the review process are addressed before the MAX is approved for return to passenger service.
A Boeing spokesman said the company is working closely with regulators on a robust and thorough certification process that includes assessing the safety of the wiring bundles. He added it was premature to say whether this will lead to a design change.

Texto completo: The U.S. military strike in Baghdad that killed Iranian general Qassem Soleimani rippled instantly through the Democratic presidential primary Friday, forcing national security issues to the fore of a race dominated so far by domestic policy and perhaps stirring debates among Democrats over matters of war and peace.
The party's presidential candidates reacted to the strike with a measure of unity, at least on the surface level, with expressions of concern about what they called the Trump administration's penchant for reckless action and the possibility of all-out war. While several deplored Soleimani's role in directing violence against Americans, the Democrats expressed anxiety rather than jubilation over the circumstances of his demise.
Former Vice President Joe Biden said President Donald Trump had "tossed a stick of dynamite into a tinderbox," while Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., warned that the attack "brings us closer to another disastrous war in the Middle East."
"Our priority must be to avoid another costly war," Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., wrote on Twitter.
But there were also distinctions in how the leading Democrats responded, pointing the way toward a larger debate in the party about foreign wars and the U.S. presence in the Middle East. Sanders, for instance, notably used the word "assassination" to describe the killing of the Iranian commander - a term with serious legal and diplomatic implications - and pointed out that he had opposed the 2002 resolution authorizing war in Iraq, leaving unsaid that Biden had supported it.
The degree to which military matters come to dominate the primary in the remaining month before the Iowa caucuses will likely depend on events in the Middle East and how severe and visible any ensuing clash with Iran turns out to be. Foreign affairs have played a strictly limited role so far in the Democratic race. There have been major debate-stage duels over health care, taxation, immigration, criminal justice and gun control but only glancing disagreements about the role of the United States abroad and the proper way to resolve U.S. military engagements in the Middle East and Central Asia.
In 2020, the possibility of a new and protracted conflict abroad could well reshape the general election, even beyond the Democratic race. Trump ran for president on a pledge to pull back the United States from foreign wars, drawing support from unconventional quarters for a Republican because of the perception that he would pursue an "America First" policy of relative isolationism and national self-interest.
But Trump had already drawn criticism from his Democratic rivals and even within his own party for presiding over a chaotic pullback from Syria, and the eruption of large-scale violence in Iran and Iraq could profoundly complicate his aim to seek a second term on a message of peace and prosperity.
In the Democratic primary, foreign policy experience has largely been regarded as an asset of Biden, given his global stature as a former vice president and his background as chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee in the Senate. He has made restoring U.S. alliances around the world a central theme of his campaign and criticized Trump for turning the United States into a punchline at gatherings of global leaders.
An intensifying debate over foreign policy could have the effect of both spotlighting Biden's extensive resumé and also subjecting his track record in the region to new scrutiny. There have been signs in recent days that several of the leading Democratic candidates were angling for a foreign policy debate with Biden even before the outbreak of violence in Iraq and the Soleimani killing came to dominate the news.
Sanders has campaigned consistently on his anti-war record, and he has repeatedly highlighted Biden's past support for the Iraq War, warning Democrats that Trump would use that record against the former vice president in a general election. On Friday morning, an aide to Sanders posted images on Twitter showing the progressive lawmaker speaking out against war in Iraq in 1991, 1998,2002 and 2014.
Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, has attempted to counter questions about his own relative inexperience by pointing to Biden's stances on Iraq as an example of how experience was not always an asset in campaigning or governing.
"He supported the worst foreign policy decision made by the United States in my lifetime, which was the decision to invade Iraq," Buttigieg said in an Iowa television interview.
Warren, too, has indicated in the past that she takes a skeptical view of U.S. military involvement in the Middle East and declared in one of the fall debates that the United States should remove its combat troops from the region. That stance could become a dividing line in the primary, separating progressives like her and Sanders from Biden and others.
For now, much of the Democratic field was proceeding with - and recommending - caution. Former Mayor Michael Bloomberg of New York released a statement questioning whether the president had fully considered "the grave risks involved," while Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., called on the administration to consult with Congress about a "strategy for preventing a wider conflict."
There is some precedent for events overseas reshaping U.S. primary elections, usually to the benefit of a candidate regarded as a figure of experience. In December 2003, the capture of Saddam Hussein in Iraq formed a backdrop for the final phase of a Democratic presidential primary that yielded the quick nomination of John Kerry, a Vietnam veteran who served on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
Four years later, the assassination of Benazir Bhutto in Pakistan in December 2007 pushed national security to the center of an unsettled Republican primary that ended with the nomination of John McCain, the war hero whose campaign focused overwhelmingly on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Texto completo: Twenty-nine years ago, Mandy Cabot and Peter Kjellerup stopped selling clogs out of a suitcase behind Chester County horse shows and moved into their own building to create Dansko, their comfort shoe company. In the decades since, sales of their trademark bulbous clogs - no stranger to derision from fashion-savvy contingents - have grown West Grove-based Dansko into a multimillion-dollar business.
Dansko's ascent was meteoric, claiming a spot among Crocs and Birkenstocks, the tier of sensible shoes deemed so unfashionable they were oddly charming. The company, which gives employees ownership interest (essentially rendering them stakeholders), earned acclaim from industry professionals for its business model and was touted as a modern, ethically run organization, similar to Ben & Jerry's, Patagonia, and Newman's Own.
Cabot and Kjellerup, of Kennett Square, retired from the company last January to focus on a new venture whose business model they hope will be as ethically significant: regenerative farming in Belize.
Five years ago, the couple began to buy 27,000 acres of land in Silk Grass, a tropical village surrounded by the world's first and largest jaguar preserve, robust fishing activity, and abundant wildlife in the southeastern region of the Central American nation.
Cabot, speaking by phone from Belize, described 3,000 acres of their property in Silk Grass as being under "serious degraded status" that urgently needed to be rehabilitated through agroforestry and permaculture. The remaining 24,000 acres is rain forest that she said will be set aside in a preserve.
Cabot and Kjellerup, who named their business Silkgrass Holdings, have hired 100 Belizians to staff and oversee the farm and fruit-processing plant that already existed on the property. It had fallen into neglect, as had its avocado, citrus, coconut, mango, pineapple, and vanilla crops. Elsewhere on the farm, the couple owns groves that grow mahogany, yemeri - a type of tropical hardwood - passion fruit, and cacao.
"The citrus was old and dying, and the coconut was at varying stages of productivity," said Cabot, 65. "The pineapple was gone and the avocado was gone. It had been neglected for 18 years."
She and Kjellerup - the latter trained as a farmer in Denmark - have improved the soil fertility with biochar, a charcoal-like substance produced by burning natural waste (which researchers suspect could mitigate some climate change) and using worms to break down organic matter. Those measures, Cabot says, could cultivate healthy fruit groves and allow workers to process and sell oil from the coconuts.
"What if the [business] model could be that the farm was income-generating, providing jobs with dignity and purpose that could start putting capital back into the local community?" said the Harvard-educated Cabot, who serves on the boards of The Nature Conservancy, Penn Medicine Chester County Hospital, and the YMCA of Greater Brandywine.
"It's sort of like reversing the extraction economy that had been imposed on this country for a long, long time," she said, referring to the period of British colonization in Belize during the 19th century.
At Silk Grass, she and husband Kjellerup (pronounced "keller-up"), 74, want to in part implement the charity-based business model of Newman's Own, the Connecticut-based food company launched in 1982 by late actor Paul Newman and novelist and editor A.E. Hotchner (now 99 years old). The company, which as of 2019 has reportedly donated $550 million to organizations around the world, donates all of its profits via its charitable Newman's Own Foundation, after accounting for business expenses.
From the Newman's Own model, "you set up guardrails for how the business should operate and what the mission values are, and you set that up in perpetuity," Cabot said. "We also want to give every opportunity to the business to continue on long after we're gone."
Worm composting and tropical fruit, Cabot acknowledges, is quite the departure from clogs. Yet the Silk Grass business model, she said, is inspired by what she called Dansko's practice of including its employees as de facto stakeholders.
More broadly, it follows in the trend of a growing cohort of for-profit companies that push for social equality, environmental well-being, transparency to the public, legal accountability, and high-quality jobs. Such businesses are often categorized B Corps, a certification aimed at balancing profit and purpose that companies like Patagonia, Eileen Fisher, and Allagash Brewing have sought. B Corp is one of several initiatives under the auspices of Berwyn-based B Lab.
Dansko had been a certified B Corp for 11 years, until it disagreed with a change in the latter's legal policy in January 2018 and stopped being a member. In Belize, Cabot and Kjellerup say they want to certify Silkgrass Holdings as a B Corp, the first one there.
"For me, this is tapping into the entrepreneurial skill set we had when we started Dansko, and I'm way more comfortable and energized at this stage of enterprise building" than she was at Dansko, Cabot said. She has removed herself from Dansko's day-to-day operations but remains chairwoman of the company's board of directors, with Kjellerup as director. "Dansko is so far along and in the hands of high-skilled and capable people. It's at a different set of skills than what we had when we started."
From their new home in Central America, Cabot and Kjellerup are far from the chefs, restaurant servers, nurses, teachers, and doctors in the U.S. who plod around in Dansko's thick, utilitarian, wood-bottomed footwear and extol the virtues of such an orthopedically sound shoe.
And the shoe itself has been embraced by a new, unlikely breed of customer: The "most stylish and constitutionally avant-garde" women in New York City have increasingly taken to sporting Danskos, according to the New York Times Style Magazine in 2017. It was, perhaps, a smoke signal that this shoe could be onto something in the wave of "normcore," the trend of donning unembellished - and at times unfashionable - dress.
Designers once declared the shoe "ugly-chic," then included them in their stylebooks. Clog Instagrammer Lauren Mechling called it footwear "with no politics," a "stupidly comfortable place of bad good taste." Two-thousand-eighteen, the internet declared, was "the year of the clog."
By most accounts, Dansko, centered in southern Chester County in a squat LEED-certified building where a recycled rain waterfall hydrates a wall of plants, had become a haven for sensible shoe evangelists. ("There is no delicate arch, no pointed toe," Mechling said, "just leather and wood and practicality.")
And for the most part, Cabot and Jim Fox, the company's current chief executive, have little to say about Dansko's journey in the world of high fashion. They just call it comfortable footwear. Even its name is humble: "dan," or "Danish," and "sko," or shoe.
She felt it was time to move on.
"We're not of retirement temperament," Cabot said. "We were really ready to do something more - and something different."

Texto completo: MAGADAN, Russia - Like many young people in Magadan, a frigid northern Russian city more than 3,600 miles from Moscow, Dinat Yur is fed up with living in a place where winters drag on for six months and the average annual temperature is below freezing.
"I really dream of leaving this place," said Yur, a 29-year-old cook. "I can't wait."
Born and raised in a city proud of its resilience against climatic and all other odds, Yur has for the moment found his calling in a defiantly contrarian occupation for a place so cold: He makes ice cream.
As the temperature in Magadan dipped the other week to well below freezing - on its way to -58 degrees Fahrenheit once winter really sets in - he was hard at work mixing milk, sugar and a raspberry mush imported from Italy to produce a summery swirl of frozen gelato.
Eating his confections outside during winter, Yur conceded, is not a good idea - they quickly turn to teeth-cracking chunks of ice - but "everyone here likes to sit at home in front of the TV with some ice cream."
Russia's curious love affair with ice cream has long been a subject of theorizing about how a country plagued by such terrible weather and other miserable conditions manages to keep going, prevailing over seemingly insurmountable hurdles.
Particularly popular in Russia is a story, probably apocryphal, about a visit to Moscow in the winter of 1944 by Winston Churchill that has Britain's wartime leader noticing Muscovites eating ice cream on a snowy street from his car window and declaring "such a people will never be conquered."
Moscow, however, has winters that usually hover in the 20s - meaning that Magadan is pushing the limits of this against-the-odds spirit.
Burdened by its Stalin-era beginnings as the gateway to a string of brutal labor camps in nearby Kolyma - where tens of thousands were executed and more than 100,000 died of disease and hunger - the city is trying to rebrand itself cheerily as the "golden heart of Russia," a reference to vast reserves of gold buried in nearby mountains.
Built on an icy bay overlooking the Sea of Okhotsk, north of Japan, Magadan is Russia's version of Dawson City, the Canadian town created by the Klondike Gold Rush at the end of the 19th century. Only Russians never rushed to Magadan; they were dragged there.
The only recent rush has been to the exit.
Young people particularly are making a run for it, a stampede that the city's mayor, Yuri Grishin, has worked to slow. He points to a new sports complex now under construction, a rash of restaurant openings and fresh licks of paint for buildings in the center of town as possible encouragement for people to stay put.
After years of dramatic decline that slashed the population by more than 40%, the mayor said the number of residents has now "more or less stabilized" at around 91,000.
But among those who have moved away are the mayor's own three grown children. One now lives in Moscow.
The mayor does not understand. Why would anyone trade Magadan for the capital, where "they will live in a tiny apartment and spend three hours a day in traffic jams," he asked.
Aside from its bleak weather and even bleaker history, Magadan is, if truth be told, no worse - and in some respects better - than many provincial Russian towns. It has the same crumbling concrete apartment blocks, the same colonnaded theater building, the same central square formerly named after Lenin and the same street slogans celebrating victory in the Great Patriotic War, as Russia refers to World War II.
It also has three movie houses, two indoor public swimming pools, a well-deserved reputation for camaraderie and a huge new Orthodox cathedral with glittering golden domes, an indispensable feature of urban planning in the age of President Vladimir Putin.
Another plus is climate change, which is making winters somewhat milder. It did not start snowing heavily this year until late November.
When the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, Magadan had 155,000 people. They were a mix of locally born residents - many of them descendants of former gulag prisoners, guards or administrators - and outsiders attracted by salaries that had for years been far higher than in the rest of the country. That was thanks to the "northern bonus," a Soviet-era premium offered to anyone willing to work there.
But for many people in Magadan, the end of the Soviet Union meant economic ruin. The slashing of Soviet-era subsidies sent Magadan salaries tumbling. As factories closed and services withered, some free-market zealots in Moscow suggested that the city be put out of its misery and shut down.
Putin, though, has done the opposite, stressing the importance of keeping remote northern outposts alive, no matter the cost. His calculations include security, patriotic pride in Russia's reach, and economics: Most of Russia's natural resources lie beneath the ice and snow of places like Magadan and the nearby wilds.
While Magadan is blessed with rich supplies of gold, silver and other natural resources, conditions are so harsh that some economists still question whether it makes sense to keep it as a city rather than just a transit center for contract workers heading for the mines.
But giving up on Magadan as a functioning urban center would effectively return it to its original role when it was founded in 1929 - a grim seaport through which geologists and then gulag laborers passed on their way to the gold mines of Kolyma. Alexander Solzhenitsyn, the author of "The Gulag Archipelago," described this particular outpost of the gulag as "the pole of cold and cruelty."
When Solzhenitsyn returned to Russia in 1994 after years of exile in Vermont, he made Magadan his first stop, explaining upon his arrival from Alaska that he had "come to bow to the land where many hundreds of thousands of our countrymen, who were executed, are buried."
Because of the flight of young people, Magadan now has a severe shortage of able-bodied workers. The mayor said the city needed 20,000 more people to do construction and other work and is making do in the meantime by bringing in workers on short-term contracts.
"It upsets me that people have this stereotype of Magadan as a big prison camp," the mayor said. The city, he added, is "repositioning itself as a bright, colorful and happy place."

Texto completo: BY JOHN CARUCCI
The Associated Press
NEW YORK - Rose McGowan doesn't plan be in the courtroom when Harvey Weinstein's criminal
Trial starts this week: One of Weinstein's most prominent accusers, McGowan said the trauma the fallen Hollywood mogul caused her is so great she couldn't bear the pain of it.
But Rosanna Arquette, another accuser, has already made plans to be there when it starts, to lend support to the women who have accused Weinstein of sexual assault and plan to testify against him.
"I feel very protective. I want this to be OK,"
Arquette said in an interview. "I think either way, whatever happens, it's still going to be hard for the people that came forward, in terms of retaliation. He's all about that."
Both McGowan and Arquette spoke to The Associated Press in separate interviews on Friday about the upcoming trial of Weinstein, the once all-powerful Hollywood producer whose world came crashing down in 2017 when parallel investigations by The New York Times and The New Yorker documented alleged sexual misconduct by Weinstein against dozens of women. From Oscar-
Winning stars to aspiring actresses to associates, claims of sexual harassment, assault and even rape were leveled against Weinstein.
Prosecutors in New York have filed five criminal charges against Weinstein, including two counts of predatory sexual assault that carry a mandatory life sentence.
Weinstein, 67, has denied allegations of non-consensual sex, and his lawyer has promised a vigorous defense. Jury selection is expected to begin on Monday.
McGowan has accused Weinstein of raping her over 20 years ago and destroying her career; Weinstein has denied her claims (his representative did not immediately respond to an email request sent Saturday seeking comment on McGowan and Arquette's comments made Friday).
Since the allegations against Weinstein sparked the #MeToo movement, McGowan has emerged as a vigorous advocate for sexual assault victims. Though she told the AP in 2018 she would be at any trial, McGowan now says while she might be outside the courtroom when it starts, she couldn't imagine being on the inside.
"I also have to focus on what's healthy mentally for me, and seeing him is extremely difficult," she said. "You know, I had body flashbacks for years when I would see and receive photos of him or if I saw him in person, I would lean over and throw up in a trash can and my body remembered, you know, things that my brain wanted to silence."
McGowan said seeing Weinstein face criminal charges "will speak volumes to people in the world that have been hurt. And I hope it gets justice for the women involved. Personally, I have justice. My justice might just look different than that."
She added that if Weinstein is found guilty of even one charge, "it's a victory, but it's also a victory to still be standing after all this damn time. It's also a victory to spread the news to other survivors, that is not our shame. It's also a victory to basically have him as the face of rape for all time."
Arquette has accused Weinstein of derailing her career after she resisted his advances, and she was one of the first women to come forward and tell her story in 2017 (Weinstein has also
Denied retaliating against women who refused to have sex with him). She told the AP she never thought she would see the day that he would face a trial for his alleged crimes.
Arquette was emotional as she talked about his upcoming trial.
"This is a man that is a real predator," she said. "He's destroyed many women's lives. ... We need to keep the focus on this crime, and this case with Harvey Weinstein is huge because so many people are looking at it."
Arquette is close friends with one of the women expected to testify against Weinstein: actress Annabella Sciorra, who has accused Weinstein of raping her more than two decades ago. Although Weinstein is not charged with a crime connected with that allegation, prosecutors are hoping to establish a pattern of behavior with her testimony.
Arquette is hoping the testimony of Sciorra and others will lead to an eventual conviction against Weinstein.
Said Arquette: "The justice system works in a way ... people can get out of criminal behavior, and we're praying that that doesn't happen and that there's justice is served."

Texto completo: Fred Graham
WASHINGTON - Fred P. Graham, who covered the Supreme Court and momentous legal affairs of his era for The New York Times, CBS News and Court TV, has died at his Washington home. He was 88.
The cause of his death on Saturday, Dec. 28, 2019, was complications from Parkinson's disease, according to his wife, Skila Harris.
Graham was the first lawyer hired by the Times to cover the Supreme Court and was a founding anchor of Court TV, a pioneering position made possible by the opening of criminal trials to TV coverage from inside the courtroom in the early 1990s.
Known for his soothing Southern drawl, Graham studied at Yale, Vanderbilt and Oxford universities and practiced law and worked in federal government jobs before the Times hired him to cover the high court in 1965. He moved to CBS News in 1972 as the Watergate scandal was heating up.
During his time at CBS and Court TV, he led efforts to get TV cameras into courtrooms. He was a co-founder of the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, an organization created to protect journalists' First Amendment rights.
"Graham was instrumental in creating the organization that we are today," said the committee's chairman, Stephen J. Adler, and in "ensuring that legal reporters have the legal support they need."
Graham, the son of a Presbyterian preacher, attended a small elementary school in Texarkana, Arkansas; high school in Nashville, Tennessee; and Yale on a scholarship. After several years in the Marine Corps, in Japan and Korea, he earned a law degree at Vanderbilt while working as a reporter at The Tennessean.
Graham attended Oxford University as a Fulbright scholar. Then he returned to Nashville and worked as a lawyer before Sen. Estes Kefauver brought him to Washington to work as chief counsel of a Senate subcommittee. Graham later served as an aide to Labor Secretary W. Willard Wirtz.
The New York Times was looking for a replacement for its Supreme Court reporter and chose Graham, launching his long career in legal journalism. After moving to CBS News in 1972, Graham worked there until 1987, when the network was cutting staff and did not renew his contract. He returned to Nashville to work at a local television station. But his absence from national news didn't last long.
When a cable startup known as Court TV was looking for anchors to start its legal coverage, Graham was one of the first hired for the network, which provided extensive coverage of all types of court cases, including business disputes and the O.J. Simpson murder trial.
Graham's extensive coverage of the courts helped give him the background later to write four books, including a memoir, and numerous articles on legal topics for magazines and newspapers around the country.
Graham won a Peabody Award, for his coverage of the Watergate scandal, and three Emmy awards.

Texto completo: Special to the Star Tribune
Imagine that Ruhollah Khomeini, the former Supreme Leader of Iran who led the Islamic Revolution, finds his palace swarmed by hundreds of thousands of ghosts who were executed by revolutionaries. An elected Council of Ghosts visits Khomeini and offers an ultimatum: "Either you die right now or you build a palace of mirrors, the instructions for which we will give you in fragments, day by day. The day the palace is completed you will die."
Deep in the cavity of a mountain, construction begins. And there, lost in a sea of dark reflections, Khomeini eventually dies, alone and powerless.
This disturbing anecdote, furnished with dazzling imagery, is a perfect introduction to "The Enlightenment of the Greengage Tree" by Shokoofeh Azar. Originally written in Farsi and translated into English by a translator who prefers to remain anonymous, this novel is set in the decade following the Islamic Revolution of 1979 and centers on a family that flees ideological persecution in Tehran for a remote village.
Though steeped in grim political realities, the novel reads like a tall tale. Populated by mystical beings (forest jinns, mermaids) and apocryphal events (black snow, a flood of ghost tears), it is narrated by the ghost of the family's daughter, who, at 13, perished in a fire caused by revolutionaries.
The rest of the family is equally doomed and charmed. The mother achieves enlightenment from atop a greengage tree and later abandons her family to wander the country in silence. The sister, Beeta, once dreamed of becoming a ballerina and ends up a mermaid. Her brother Sohrab, an aspiring journalist, is held as a political prisoner without trial.
Azar strikes a remarkable balance between the fantastical and historical fact. What unites these two fronts is an exactness, by way of enumeration and time, which lends credibility to both aspects of the narrative. Events are chronicled with exaggerated precision ("at exactly 9:24 and 3 seconds on an ordinary morning in 1988 … all the clocks from the Martyr Foundation went to sleep") and roundedness ("for three days and three nights"). Elsewhere, steps are enumerated, as if navigating a treasure map.
What is inexact, however, is the toll of violence. "Some say it was September 27, 1988, and some say it was later. Either way … five thousand men and women, young and old, whose only crime had been their political or religious belief, were killed." We can only estimate the number of lives lost in the Islamic Revolution and its violent aftermath.
This is true, even today. The November protests in Iran, sparked by a spike in gas prices, mark the most volatile time in Iranian politics since the Islamic Revolution. The government responded to protests with an internet blackout and lethal force, leaving between 180 and 450 people dead, the New York Times reported.
It is often necessary, in the face of brutal oppression, to speak in code. Coded language comes in many forms -- from satire to Signal, an encrypted messaging app. Then there are books, which, for the narrator and her family, "had always been the first and last refuge."
Connor Goodwin is a writer and critic from Lincoln, Neb. His writing has appeared in the Washington Post, Seattle Times, BOMB, Inside Hook and elsewhere.

McDermott: Never Trumpers deserve credit for seeing danger through the fog of partisanship

Texto completo: Some words of wisdom:
- "Before Donald Trump, the Republican Party was a majority conservative party with a white nationalist fringe. Now it's a white nationalist party with a conservative fringe."
- "If congressional Republicans continue their genuflections at Trump's altar, the appropriate 2020 outcome will be a Republican thrashing so severe … that even this party of slow-learning careerists might notice the hazards of tethering their careers to a downward-spiraling scofflaw."
- "He's going to be gone at some point and there's going to be a reckoning and history isn't going to be kind to people who said nothing or stood up for Trump."
What these passages all have in common -- apart from their self-evident accuracy -- is that they all come from prominent conservative Republicans (or former Republicans). They are from, respectively, author and former Wall Street Journal op-ed editor Max Boot; Washington Post columnist George F. Will, long one of the conservative movement's intellectual giants; and Republican lawyer George Conway, whose marriage to unrepentant Trumpian mouthpiece Kellyanne Conway should surely be the basis for either a psychology textbook or a smash hit comedy.
Trump is the most divisive president of our lifetimes. But he has also had the odd effect of bringing together liberals and some conservatives, at least on the issue of presidential fitness.
It's not like they met in the middle, though. We liberals have the luxury of opposing Trump's unfitness without altering political course. It's the "Never Trump" Republicans (derided as "human scum" by our oh-so-eloquent president) who are doing all the moving.
And they deserve credit for what is, in many ways, an unprecedented show of courage and principle over partisan power-mongering.
I can already hear my more liberal friends gnashing their teeth and pointing out some truisms.
Yes, many of the Never-Trump movement's stars -- Weekly Standard founder William Kristol, New York Times columnist David Brooks, former George W. Bush speechwriter David Frum and others -- helped create the conditions that ushered in the Trumpism they now abhor. They sat silently as their party embraced populism and played footsie with racism. They pushed economic policies that coddled the rich and stoked working-class resentment. They goaded us into such a stupid war that bullheaded isolationism looks brilliant by comparison. In many ways, they made this bed.
But that's precisely why their voices are so valuable now.
If a Rachel Maddow were to appeal to potential GOP presidential candidates to oppose Trump's renomination, for example, it would inevitably sound cynical. But consider this direct appeal from Kristol, whose pro-GOP motives are unquestioned:
"You have a unique chance to act for your party and your country. You can play a role in overcoming the shame and stain of the past three years, and in the reformation of a once great party. Win or lose, you will go down in the history books as a man or woman of honor."
If a top Democratic strategist were to warn that the GOP has lost its way under Trump and no longer honors its own principles, it could be dismissed as just another partisan attack. But it's less easy to dismiss top GOP strategist Stuart Stevens' assessment:
"A party without a governing theory, a higher purpose or a clear moral direction is nothing more than a cartel, a syndicate that exists only to advance itself. … A party that has as its sole purpose the protection and promotion of its leader, whatever he thinks, is not on a sustainable path."
A liberal's analysis of the damage Trump has done to this country and what it will take to heal could be fairly viewed as exaggeration for the sake of political gain. But from someone like Frum, it becomes a dire warning:
"Restoring American democracy to healthy functioning will take more than the ejection of Donald Trump from the White House. Shoring up the frayed political system will require leaders who can rebuild Americans' trust in one another and in institutions, and reestablish historical norms. As Trump assembles fuel and flame to scorch the earth he leaves behind, that will not be easy."
Historically, partisans will generally hold their noses and get past whatever they don't like about an incumbent president of their own party. The power to shape the courts, alone, is often held up as justification enough to get along.
As the Never Trumpers understand (and as too many other Republicans, including most in Congress, don't), Trump's unique unfitness for office makes that common tradeoff ethically indefensible here. No roster of judges is worth the damage this man has done to our political norms, our democratic institutions and our standing in the world.
Kudos to those rare Republicans who, at risk of exile, are calling out the party they've always called home. Any liberals who think otherwise should ask themselves honestly: If a Democratic version of Donald Trump were wreaking havoc and threatening democracy on behalf of your side instead of theirs, would you see the danger so clearly?

Luis Alfaro addresses the immigrant experience with 'Mojada' at the Rep

Texto completo: Luis Alfaro has been inspired by classic Greek drama. His play "Electricidad" put a contemporary spin on Sophocles' "Electra," the tale of a woman who seeks revenge for the murder of her father. With "Oedipus El Rey," a reworking of another Sophocles tragedy, the Chicano playwright and activist similarly reimagined that tragic account of patricide and mother-son incest.
On Friday, "Mojada: A Medea in Los Angeles" -- Alfaro's take on Euripides' disturbing tale of a woman who kills her children -- opens on the mainstage at the Repertory Theatre of St. Louis.
A Los Angeles native who has a background as a poet and performance artist and was awarded a MacArthur "genius" grant in 1997, Alfaro has found that Greek tragedies are quite adaptable to addressing the immigrant experience. His interest in those time-tested masterpieces emerged when he came across a play collection in a bookstore.
"I had never read the Greeks," he said. "And the first play was 'Electra.'" It struck him as not unlike "a modern gang story" -- and set a new stage for his work as a dramatist.
"I wanted to see if I could learn something from the Greeks, who wrote incredible morality tales -- with incredible lessons for the community," said Alfaro, who is an associate professor of dramatic writing in the School of Dramatic Arts at the University of Southern California. "I just went for it."
"Mojada" was also influenced by a personal encounter.
"I was working with young girls at a teen correctional facility," he said. "And I met one who had murdered her mother. She was just 13 years old." What the girl told him was "a really tragic tale of crime and poverty, and the violence of poverty."
Directed at the Rep by Rebecca Martinez, "Mojada" is the modern-day story of a Mexican immigrant family coping with life in L.A. The central conflict is between Medea (Cheryl Umana) and the man in her life, Jason (Peter Mendoza) -- whose betrayal of her love leads to tragedy.
Last summer, "Mojada" was produced at the Public Theater in New York, with the play set not in Los Angeles but in the borough of Queens. In a review, the New York Times observed that the play "finds surprising vitality within the stasis of its doomed heroine's existence" and is "most entertaining as an evocation of an exhaustingly ambitious nation in which the failure to be self-serving and self-promoting is a cardinal sin."
"Mojada" has also been set in Chicago, where it was produced in 2013 at the Victory Gardens Theatre. As with the New York production, the idea was to allow the story to reflect the social and cultural dynamics of the community in which it was performed.
"I've been a poet forever, and that's how I got to know the country," Alfaro said. "I just started touring around with other poets. You sleep on a lot of floors and read (your work) in a lot of bookstores and coffeehouses."
That experience, he said, gave him an appreciation for America "in a different way."
Like many of its recipients, Alfaro said he was surprised and initially skeptical 22 years ago when the MacArthur Foundation contacted him with news of the "genius" grant of $230,000 (the honor now comes with $625,000).
"I gave most of the money away, which I really regret," he said. "I was born and raised in absolute poverty, so money's never really been the issue for me. It's access -- and that's what the MacArthur gave me."
"Mojada" has sparked controversy because of its title: a derogatory term for undocumented immigrants, with much the same sting as "wetback." Alfaro said his intention was not to offend, but to make a point.
"I felt very strongly that I wanted to use that word -- mojada -- because I wanted to talk about the way we see certain people in our society," he said. "The way we categorize people and the way we use certain words that can disempower them.
"Am I trying to re-contextualize that word? I think I am."

Texto completo: There is something very wrong with this picture: The land of opportunity hides an unpredictable and unknowable monster that threatens to devour anyone unlucky enough to get sick without adequate medical insurance.
If that doesn’t scare you, it’s only because you’re not fully aware of the danger and the breadth by which it affects all of us.
The monster is the high cost of medical care in the United States and, as a result, the horrifying ease with which individuals and families can be plunged into medical debt from which there is no escape.
Two stories in the past week brought the related problems of high medical costs and consequential medical debt into clearer focus. What remains sadly unclear is what can be done to tame the medical-costs monster and protect Americans from the quicksand of medical debt.
But as awareness grows around unsustainable medical costs, so, too, does the imperative for 2020 presidential campaigns to offer solutions. We begin to see why President Donald Trump and every serious Democratic candidate are pushing proposals to reduce medical costs and expand Americans’ access to affordable health care.
The high cost of medical care in the U.S. was highlighted in a New York Times report this past week.
It noted that an annual report by the International Federation of Health Plans has again found, as it does every year, that in nearly every category, the price for medical tests and procedures, medications and even basic checkups is higher here than anywhere else in the world.
And the U.S. prices are not just marginally higher. In most cases, what patients are charged here is many multiples of what it might cost to obtain the same care in other countries. Examples included a $32,200 average U.S. price to clear a blocked blood vessel to the heart compared to $6,400 in the Netherlands; or $1,420 for an MRI scan here but just $450 for the same test in Britain.
Even more aggravating, if that’s possible, is the disparity of prices within the United States, or even in the same region.
In a recent story on medical debt, Dispatch Reporter Megan Henry found a $50,000 variance for prostate cancer surgery between what a Springfield hospital priced at $80,000 and what the Arthur G. James Cancer Hospital, part of the Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, eventually performed for $30,000.
In one case, Henry found a Springfield hospital declined to even quote a price while telling an uninsured woman it would not provide the potentially lifesaving colon cancer surgery she needed because she couldn’t pay for it.
Getting out of this medical mess will require a painful remedy, but the cost of not treating it is worse as health care insurance continues to cost more for individuals, families and employers.
Forcing hospitals and physicians to lower their charges could threaten the availability of health care in certain areas. Transitioning to a government-sponsored universal access program, as some Democratic presidential candidates tout, would jeopardize the insurance industry, producing economic ripples.
There is good reason why some say the path to the White House can be paved by solving the United States’ medical cost-and-coverage conundrum.

Wasserman-Schultz claims Trump ordered Soleimani strike out of 'self interest'

Texto completo: Rep. Debbie Wasserman-Schultz repeated a familiar talking point coming from Democratic lawmakers in recent days, suggesting President Trump ordered the killing of a top Iranian general this week to distract the American public from his impeachment.
"This action was taken more in President Trump's self-interest rather than our national interest," Wasserman-Schultz said Sunday on CNN. "We had damning developments in just the last day ... That is outrageous, and I think it has a lot to do with why the attack was carried out."
Wasserman-Schultz appeared to be referencing a report by the New York Times from over the weekend, showing the White House sought to conceal a series of e-mails between top Trump administration officials and the Office of Budget Management regarding frozen military aid to Ukraine at the center of impeachment.
House Democrats passed two articles of impeachment late last year: one on abuse of power and another on obstruction of Congress. The impeachment comes as a result of an intelligence community whistleblower report alleging that Trump pressured Ukraine to interfere in the 2020 election by investigating his political rival, Joe Biden, and leveraged the military aid as a bargaining chip.
An impeachment trial is expected to start in the coming weeks in the Republican-controlled Senate, where the prosecution is expected to fail.
Trump has called his impeachment a "hoax" and a "witch hunt." At the same time, he has preached a hard-line message of "America first" on foreign policy and vowed to keep the United States out of "endless wars."
At the command of Trump, U.S. forces took out top Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani on Thursday after the U.S. government received what Trump described as "very major" and credible intelligence that Soleimani was plotting to kill American diplomats and military personnel in the Middle East.
Some Democrats and media pundits have questioned the decision, which they say could start an all-out war with Iran. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was asked on Sunday if a now-impeached Trump is seen as weak by America's enemies around the world.
"You should ask Mr. Soleimani," Pompeo answered.

Pompeo: 'No skepticism' among Trump officials that Soleimani was planning attack on Americans

Texto completo: Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani was planning an imminent strike on Americans before a U.S. drone strike killed the foreign military leader.
Pompeo appeared on ABC's This Week on Sunday to respond to claims that evidence of an imminent attack on Americans was "thin." Pompeo said that senior national security leadership with access to all of the evidence had “no skepticism” that Soleimani was planning an attack on American targets.
"The senior leadership who had access to all of the intelligence — there was no skepticism. I think [Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff] Gen. Milley used the term, 'We would have been culpably negligent had we not taken this strike,'" Pompeo said.
"The intelligence assessment made clear that no action — allowing Soleimani to continue his plotting, his planning, and his terror campaign — created more risk than taking the action that we took last week," Pompeo continued.

Following the airstrike that killed Soleimani, Pompeo said the move was in response to an "imminent threat" on Americans. The New York Times reported on Saturday, however, that several administration officials believed the evidence that suggested Soleimani was planning an attack amounted to "business as usual" and "a normal Monday in the Middle East."
According to the paper, intelligence suggested that Soleimani was seeking approval for a strike that could have killed hundreds of Americans at embassies, consulates, and military bases in Syria, Iraq, and Lebanon. Officials disagreed whether the evidence justified a belief in an attack, and some said that an attack was not imminent because Soleimani had not yet received approval from Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.

Timothy Egan: The case for a one-term Joe

Texto completo: You may have heard an old crank in a big house ranting about appliances and unflushable toilets the other day. “Remember the dishwasher, you’d press it, boom — there’d be like an explosion,” he said, apropos of nothing. “Now you press it 12 times.”
The bathroom is another battleground. In the shower, “you turn on the faucet, you don’t get any water.” It gets worse. “People are flushing toilets 10 times, 15 times, as opposed to once.”
Of course, that was our own President Donald Trump, who will be 74 on Election Day, and would like to be known for “my great and unmatched wisdom,” even if he seems flummoxed by the great obstacle facing a toilet-training 2-year-old.
But had it been Joe Biden who muttered such gibberish, it would have prompted another round of age-shaming. Imagine if Biden had made up a country that doesn’t exist (“Nambia”), or gave a new name to his secretary of defense (“Mark Esperanto”) and the chief executive of Apple (“Tim Apple”)? Dare I mention “covfefe”? As Trump wrote, what comes out of his mouth is “unpresidented.”
Biden will be 77 on Election Day and would be the oldest person ever elected president. He mixes up places, people, dates and decades. He still shows signs of his struggle to overcome a childhood stutter, which is not to be confused with age.
Yet, compared with the tongue-tangled, fact-mangling, grammar-assaulting, nonsense-spewing, hate-and-grievance-filled current occupant of the White House, Biden is Churchill.
Which brings us to the question of how Uncle Joe should handle his age. Answer: He’s already done it, which is to signal that he would be open to serving only one term. For the record, Biden has denied what was initially leaked by his own camp and reported by Politico.
Most political pros think it’d be crazy for Biden to give himself lame-duck status from Day 1. What they miss is that such a pledge, telegraphed subtly, could be just the thing that gets him in the position to have a Day 1.
A one-term president can be unhinged or liberated or both, but is certainly not powerless. Free from overreacting to the swings of daily tracking polls, the lame duck can fly to great heights.
Nothing in a one-term president’s powers keep the executive from nominating Supreme Court justices, signing life-changing legislation, vetoing terrible bills or renewing the United States’ role as a global citizen in the existential fight against climate change.
By executive order, a one-term president can keep poisons out of rivers, forbid family separation at the border and restore the honor of the military code of justice. He can order his Justice Department to back efforts in court to ensure that people with pre-existing medical conditions are not dumped by their insurance companies. He can welcome science, civility and culture back into the White House. He can protect children from lunatics who now have easy access to military-style weapons.
And all the while, people can look to a younger and farsighted vice president as the logical next step. Perhaps the quickest way to get a President Stacey Abrams or President Pete Buttigieg is to first elect a President Biden.
Voters are exhausted by the vulgarian in chief. They want a day, a week even, when their president doesn’t lie to them, shout at them or call members of his own party or federal law enforcement “human scum.” They want their children to come out from hiding when the president appears.
Trump is retro in the worst ways, far beyond his hatred of energy-efficient light bulbs, windmills and new appliances. He’s also a remarkably lazy old man. His mornings are consumed by tweeting and bathing in the Dear Leader affirmation of Fox News. He spent one in five days last year at a golf course, and he has made 236 visits overall to golf clubs since he took office, costing taxpayers $115 million.
Biden’s support has not wavered, especially among people of color and disaffected whites — a coalition no other candidate can match. Once the nominating process gets past the white and unrepresentative states of Iowa and New Hampshire, the new America will show its power: States representing one-third of the U.S. population will vote on Super Tuesday, March 3. Biden is well positioned.
Biden’s closest rival, Sen. Bernie Sanders, will be 79 on Election Day. He still has a lot of steam left in the engine. But the engine smells too much like 19th-century socialism, a failed economic system repackaged under Sanders’ slogan of a “political revolution.”
At times, Biden can sound like he’s stuck in a time warp, an era of record players and malarkey and push-up challenges. He likes to hug. But his politics are not static; he was ahead of President Barack Obama on marriage equality and the futility of the Afghan war. If an emboldened Congress were to send him a piece of substantive progressive legislation, he’d sign it.
Trump promotes, and lives in, an actual time warp — the America of white dominance and energy gluttony and butt-groping by men in power. At the dawn of a year when we all need a long convalescence from the craziness, a one-term Joe may be just the restorative.

Texto completo: Un nuevo tipo de misiles que pueden alcanzar velocidades hipersónicas han sido desde hace un tiempo objeto de deseos de líderes militares de Estados Unidos, Rusia y Chin a. Vladirmir Putin anunció la semana pasada el despliegue de Avangard -uno de los primeros entre estos vehículos militares-, lo que provocó que Estados Unidos se pusiera las pilas para igualar a los rusos .
Las prisas del ejército estadounidense se explican porque un misil como Avangard podría llegar en minutos a cualquier país y, hasta la fecha, no existe defensa alguna para interceptarlo y detenerlo debido a su gran velocidad y a lo difícil que resulta predecir sus movimientos.
Algo que sí se vislumbra es la creciente tensión por el control de la innovación armamentística, que, según el New York Times, podría ser tan sangrienta como la Guerra Fría.
La gran velocidad de este nuevo tipo de armamentística reduce el tiempo de reacción y planteamiento de las estrategias militares . Esto -unido al agotamiento de los mandos, al encuentro de emociones y a la incertidumbre- puede provocar que se tomen decisiones a la ligera y que tengan un efecto irreparable.
Esta volatilidad sería aún más extrema en casos en los que ambos bandos tengan misiles hipersónicos que les impidan conocer el blanco de los enemigos o el tipo de ataque que los otros están planeando. En casos como ese, señala el Times, la incertidumbre llevaría a las dos partes a tratar de disparar primero sin ninguna estrategia ampliamente estudiada.
Otro de los peligros que entraña los misiles hipersónicos es que su fácilmente justificable uso podría hacer que se extienda como la pólvora. Por ejemplo, matar a un solo terrorista en una ciudad abarrotada podría traer consecuencias mucho más destructivas.
Al igual que ocurrió en su momento con las armas nucleares, la hipersónica se debe entender como una tecnología que cambiará las reglas del juego en las guerras . Algo que probablemente ocurrirá antes de que quienes lancen misiles como los que anunció Putin conozcan completamente las implicaciones derivadas de su uso.

Texto completo: Las autoridades del Departamento de Seguridad Nacional ( DHS ) han aumentado la vigilancia de redes sociales para ubicar inmigrantes indocumentados.
Varios reportes indican que los oficiales de Inmigración y Contol de Aduanas ( ICE ) implementan estrategias para ubicar a personas que viven en los Estados Unidos sin documentos, principalmente en redes como Facebook.
En octubre pasado, The New York Times reportó que los agentes han utilizado cuentas falsas de Facebook para monitorear a los extranjeros, una práctica que ha ido en aumento, según otros informes, como del Business Insider.
Uno de los casos fue el de una mujer llamada Gladys Díaz Tadeo , quien publicó en un grupo privado de compra y venta en Facebook un anunció sobre la venta de una piñata que había hecho con sus tres hijas. Al día siguiente, una cuenta de esa red social con un “nombre hispano” y una foto de perfil de un perro habían respondido.
Díaz acordó encontrarse con la persona en un banco local para venderles la piñata, pero cuando llegó dos agentes de ICE estaban esperando para esposarla. Fue deportada a México tres semanas después y la cuenta de Facebook que había respondido a su listado fue eliminada.
Otro caso retomado por The Intercept indica que un hombre al que se llamó “Sid” vivía en EEUU desde que tenía un año. Ahora está casado y tiene hijos estadounidenses, pero había sido deportado a México por un delito no violento que involucró bienes robados de una tienda de automóviles. El hombre volvió como indocumentado.
A “Sid” le pareció buena idea utilizar su nombre legal para darse de alta en Facebook, pero su cuenta fue ubicada por ICE, porque el inmigrante de origen mexicano también tenía licencia de conducir para indocumentados de California. Entonces los agentes hicieron un cruce de datos.
“En el caso de Sid, los oficiales de ICE comenzaron a monitorear el perfil de Facebook después de que se confirmó que era una coincidencia (en su búsqueda)” , indica The Intercept. “Cuando Sid ‘se registró’ en Facebook en un Home Depot el 24 de mayo de 2018 para comprar suministros para techos, los oficiales de ICE esperaron fuera de la tienda hasta salió del estacionamiento, luego se detuvieron y lo arrestaron”.
Como ya tenía una orden de deportación fue expulsado del país de inmediato, acusado de un delito grave de reingreso como indocumentado.
Con 14 estados ofreciendo licencias para conducir para indocumentados, la agencia puede comparar datos si logra una orden de un juez para revisar los datos de cualquier persona, aunque el Times destaca que no es la única forma en que ‘La Migra’ puede ubicar a indocumentados.
“Hoy, a quién pueden encontrar depende de quién ha dejado un rastro para que los oficiales lo sigan: personas con licencias de conducir , personas con seguro de automóvil , personas con facturas de servicios públicos , personas que pagan impuestos estadounidenses , personas con cuentas de redes sociales , personas con hogares estables , personas con niños nacidos en Estados Unidos… personas que alguna vez pensaron, aunque solo fuera por un momento, que no estaban en la lista”, indica.

La mentira de Mike Pence sobre Soleimani y el 9-11

Texto completo: Cualquier cosa para justificar actos de guerra.
Esa parece ser la posición del vicepresidente Mike Pence con respecto al asesinato del general iraní Qasem Soleimani por parte de Estados Unidos.
En una serie de tweets para justificar la acción ordenada por Donald Trump, el vicepresidente vinculó a Soleimani con los ataques a las Torres Gemelas el 11 de septiembre de 2011.

“[Soleimani] ayudó con los viajes clandestinos a Afganistán de 10 de los 12 terroristas que llevaron a cabo los ataques del 11 de septiembre en Estados Unidos”, escribió Pence.
Usuarios en redes sociales reaccionaron rápidamente a las palabras de Pence ya que al ser un representante del gobierno chiíta de Irán era muy difícil que colaborara con terroristas sunitas de origen saudí. Es conocido que Irán y Arabia Saudita son rivales en la región ya que sus gobiernos representan ramas del Islam que han estado enfrentadas por siglos.
1) there were 19 terrorists on 9/11, not 12
2) why the fuck would an agent of a theocratic Shiite state assist agents of a theocratic Sunni group? They literally hate each others' guts
3) Fuck you
— Pé Resists (@4everNeverTrump) January 3, 2020
Pero medios como el New York Times también se animaron a validar la información, y encontraron que Pence mintió respecto al rol de Soleimani en los ataques que llevaron a las guerras en Irak y Afganistán.
Lo primero es que el nombre del líder iraní nunca apareció en el el reporte de la Comisión del 9-11 . De hecho se descarta la colaboración del grupo terrorista Hezbollah, que ha sido respaldado por Irán.
“No hemos encontrado evidencia de que Irán o Hezbolá estuvieran al tanto de la planificación de lo que más tarde se convirtió en el ataque del 11 de septiembre. En el momento de su viaje a través de Irán, los propios agentes de Al Qaeda probablemente no estaban al tanto de los detalles específicos de su futura operación”, se lee en el reporte de la Comisión.
Relacionado: Soleimani planteó un ataque en terrorista en Washington utilizando al Cártel de los Zetas
El periódico neoyorquino añadió uno de los objetivos de Soleimani era desestabilizar a Arabia Saudita. También recordó que Soleimani ayudó a EEUU a capturar a elementos de Al Qaeda.

Texto completo: Las autoridades del Departamento de Seguridad Nacional ( DHS ) han aumentado la vigilancia de redes sociales para ubicar inmigrantes indocumentados.
Varios reportes indican que los oficiales de Inmigración y Contol de Aduanas ( ICE ) implementan estrategias para ubicar a personas que viven en los Estados Unidos sin documentos, principalmente en redes como Facebook.
En octubre pasado, The New York Times reportó que los agentes han utilizado cuentas falsas de Facebook para monitorear a los extranjeros, una práctica que ha ido en aumento, según otros informes, como del Business Insider.
Uno de los casos fue el de una mujer llamada Gladys Díaz Tadeo , quien publicó en un grupo privado de compra y venta en Facebook un anunció sobre la venta de una piñata que había hecho con sus tres hijas. Al día siguiente, una cuenta de esa red social con un “nombre hispano” y una foto de perfil de un perro habían respondido.
Díaz acordó encontrarse con la persona en un banco local para venderles la piñata, pero cuando llegó dos agentes de ICE estaban esperando para esposarla. Fue deportada a México tres semanas después y la cuenta de Facebook que había respondido a su listado fue eliminada.
Otro caso retomado por The Intercept indica que un hombre al que se llamó “Sid” vivía en EEUU desde que tenía un año. Ahora está casado y tiene hijos estadounidenses, pero había sido deportado a México por un delito no violento que involucró bienes robados de una tienda de automóviles. El hombre volvió como indocumentado.
A “Sid” le pareció buena idea utilizar su nombre legal para darse de alta en Facebook, pero su cuenta fue ubicada por ICE, porque el inmigrante de origen mexicano también tenía licencia de conducir para indocumentados de California. Entonces los agentes hicieron un cruce de datos.
“En el caso de Sid, los oficiales de ICE comenzaron a monitorear el perfil de Facebook después de que se confirmó que era una coincidencia (en su búsqueda)” , indica The Intercept. “Cuando Sid ‘se registró’ en Facebook en un Home Depot el 24 de mayo de 2018 para comprar suministros para techos, los oficiales de ICE esperaron fuera de la tienda hasta salió del estacionamiento, luego se detuvieron y lo arrestaron”.
Como ya tenía una orden de deportación fue expulsado del país de inmediato, acusado de un delito grave de reingreso como indocumentado.
Con 14 estados ofreciendo licencias para conducir para indocumentados, la agencia puede comparar datos si logra una orden de un juez para revisar los datos de cualquier persona, aunque el Times destaca que no es la única forma en que ‘La Migra’ puede ubicar a indocumentados.
“Hoy, a quién pueden encontrar depende de quién ha dejado un rastro para que los oficiales lo sigan: personas con licencias de conducir , personas con seguro de automóvil , personas con facturas de servicios públicos , personas que pagan impuestos estadounidenses , personas con cuentas de redes sociales , personas con hogares estables , personas con niños nacidos en Estados Unidos… personas que alguna vez pensaron, aunque solo fuera por un momento, que no estaban en la lista”, indica.

Texto completo: Un nuevo tipo de misiles que pueden alcanzar velocidades hipersónicas han sido desde hace un tiempo objeto de deseos de líderes militares de Estados Unidos, Rusia y Chin a. Vladirmir Putin anunció la semana pasada el despliegue de Avangard -uno de los primeros entre estos vehículos militares-, lo que provocó que Estados Unidos se pusiera las pilas para igualar a los rusos .
Las prisas del ejército estadounidense se explican porque un misil como Avangard podría llegar en minutos a cualquier país y, hasta la fecha, no existe defensa alguna para interceptarlo y detenerlo debido a su gran velocidad y a lo difícil que resulta predecir sus movimientos.
Algo que sí se vislumbra es la creciente tensión por el control de la innovación armamentística, que, según el New York Times, podría ser tan sangrienta como la Guerra Fría.
La gran velocidad de este nuevo tipo de armamentística reduce el tiempo de reacción y planteamiento de las estrategias militares . Esto -unido al agotamiento de los mandos, al encuentro de emociones y a la incertidumbre- puede provocar que se tomen decisiones a la ligera y que tengan un efecto irreparable.
Esta volatilidad sería aún más extrema en casos en los que ambos bandos tengan misiles hipersónicos que les impidan conocer el blanco de los enemigos o el tipo de ataque que los otros están planeando. En casos como ese, señala el Times, la incertidumbre llevaría a las dos partes a tratar de disparar primero sin ninguna estrategia ampliamente estudiada.
Otro de los peligros que entraña los misiles hipersónicos es que su fácilmente justificable uso podría hacer que se extienda como la pólvora. Por ejemplo, matar a un solo terrorista en una ciudad abarrotada podría traer consecuencias mucho más destructivas.
Al igual que ocurrió en su momento con las armas nucleares, la hipersónica se debe entender como una tecnología que cambiará las reglas del juego en las guerras . Algo que probablemente ocurrirá antes de que quienes lancen misiles como los que anunció Putin conozcan completamente las implicaciones derivadas de su uso.

La mentira de Mike Pence sobre Soleimani y el 9-11

Texto completo: Cualquier cosa para justificar actos de guerra.
Esa parece ser la posición del vicepresidente Mike Pence con respecto al asesinato del general iraní Qasem Soleimani por parte de Estados Unidos.
En una serie de tweets para justificar la acción ordenada por Donald Trump, el vicepresidente vinculó a Soleimani con los ataques a las Torres Gemelas el 11 de septiembre de 2011.

“[Soleimani] ayudó con los viajes clandestinos a Afganistán de 10 de los 12 terroristas que llevaron a cabo los ataques del 11 de septiembre en Estados Unidos”, escribió Pence.
Usuarios en redes sociales reaccionaron rápidamente a las palabras de Pence ya que al ser un representante del gobierno chiíta de Irán era muy difícil que colaborara con terroristas sunitas de origen saudí. Es conocido que Irán y Arabia Saudita son rivales en la región ya que sus gobiernos representan ramas del Islam que han estado enfrentadas por siglos.
1) there were 19 terrorists on 9/11, not 12
2) why the fuck would an agent of a theocratic Shiite state assist agents of a theocratic Sunni group? They literally hate each others' guts
3) Fuck you
— Pé Resists (@4everNeverTrump) January 3, 2020
Pero medios como el New York Times también se animaron a validar la información, y encontraron que Pence mintió respecto al rol de Soleimani en los ataques que llevaron a las guerras en Irak y Afganistán.
Lo primero es que el nombre del líder iraní nunca apareció en el el reporte de la Comisión del 9-11 . De hecho se descarta la colaboración del grupo terrorista Hezbollah, que ha sido respaldado por Irán.
“No hemos encontrado evidencia de que Irán o Hezbolá estuvieran al tanto de la planificación de lo que más tarde se convirtió en el ataque del 11 de septiembre. En el momento de su viaje a través de Irán, los propios agentes de Al Qaeda probablemente no estaban al tanto de los detalles específicos de su futura operación”, se lee en el reporte de la Comisión.
Relacionado: Soleimani planteó un ataque en terrorista en Washington utilizando al Cártel de los Zetas
El periódico neoyorquino añadió uno de los objetivos de Soleimani era desestabilizar a Arabia Saudita. También recordó que Soleimani ayudó a EEUU a capturar a elementos de Al Qaeda.

Texto completo: Cualquier cosa para justificar actos de guerra.
Esa parece ser la posición del vicepresidente Mike Pence con respecto al asesinato del general iraní Qasem Soleimani por parte de Estados Unidos.
En una serie de tweets para justificar la acción ordenada por Donald Trump, el vicepresidente vinculó a Soleimani con los ataques a las Torres Gemelas el 11 de septiembre de 2011.
Relacionado: Parlamento iraquí apoya expulsión de tropas de Estados Unidos tras muerte de Soleimani
“[Soleimani] ayudó con los viajes clandestinos a Afganistán de 10 de los 12 terroristas que llevaron a cabo los ataques del 11 de septiembre en Estados Unidos”, escribió Pence.
Usuarios en redes sociales reaccionaron rápidamente a las palabras de Pence ya que al ser un representante del gobierno chiíta de Irán era muy difícil que colaborara con terroristas sunitas de origen saudí. Es conocido que Irán y Arabia Saudita son rivales en la región ya que sus gobiernos representan ramas del Islam que han estado enfrentadas por siglos.
1) there were 19 terrorists on 9/11, not 12
2) why the fuck would an agent of a theocratic Shiite state assist agents of a theocratic Sunni group? They literally hate each others' guts
3) Fuck you
— Pé Resists (@4everNeverTrump) January 3, 2020
Pero medios como el New York Times también se animaron a validar la información, y encontraron que Pence mintió respecto al rol de Soleimani en los ataques que llevaron a las guerras en Irak y Afganistán.
Lo primero es que el nombre del líder iraní nunca apareció en el el reporte de la Comisión del 9-11 . De hecho se descarta la colaboración del grupo terrorista Hezbollah, que ha sido respaldado por Irán.
“No hemos encontrado evidencia de que Irán o Hezbolá estuvieran al tanto de la planificación de lo que más tarde se convirtió en el ataque del 11 de septiembre. En el momento de su viaje a través de Irán, los propios agentes de Al Qaeda probablemente no estaban al tanto de los detalles específicos de su futura operación”, se lee en el reporte de la Comisión.
Relacionado: Soleimani planteó un ataque en terrorista en Washington utilizando al Cártel de los Zetas
El periódico neoyorquino añadió uno de los objetivos de Soleimani era desestabilizar a Arabia Saudita. También recordó que Soleimani ayudó a EEUU a capturar a elementos de Al Qaeda.

Krugman: Apocalypse becomes the new normal

Texto completo: The past week’s images from Australia have been nightmarish: walls of flame, blood-red skies, residents huddled on beaches as they try to escape the inferno. The bush fires have been so intense that they have generated “fire tornadoes” powerful enough to flip over heavy trucks.
The thing is, Australia’s summer of fire is only the latest in a string of catastrophic weather events over the past year: unprecedented flooding in the Midwest, a heat wave in India that sent temperatures to 123 degrees, another heat wave that brought unheard-of temperatures to much of Europe.
And all of these catastrophes were related to climate change.
Notice that I said “related to” rather than “caused by” climate change. This is a distinction that has flummoxed many people over the years. Any individual weather event has multiple causes, which was one reason news reports used to avoid mentioning the possible role of climate change in natural disasters.
In recent years, however, climate scientists have tried to cut through this confusion by engaging in “extreme event attribution,” which focuses on probabilities: You can’t necessarily say that climate change caused a particular heat wave, but you can ask how much difference global warming made to the probability of that heat wave happening. And the answer, typically, is a lot: Climate change makes the kinds of extreme weather events we’ve been seeing much more likely.
And while there’s a lot of randomness in weather outcomes, that randomness actually makes climate change much more damaging in its early stages than most people realize. On our current trajectory, Florida as a whole will eventually be swallowed by the sea, but long before that happens, rising sea levels will make catastrophic storm surges commonplace. Much of India will eventually become uninhabitable, but killing heat waves and droughts will take a deadly toll well before that point is reached.
Put it this way: While it will take generations for the full consequences of climate change to play out, there will be many localized, temporary disasters along the way. Apocalypse will become the new normal — and that’s happening right in front of our eyes.
The big question is whether the proliferation of climate-related disasters will finally be enough to break though the opposition to action.
There are some hopeful signs. One is that the news media has become much more willing to talk about the role of climate change in weather events.
Not long ago it was all too common to read articles about heat waves, floods and droughts that seemed to go to great lengths to avoid mentioning climate change. My sense is that reporters and editors have finally gotten over that block.
The public also seems to be paying attention, with concern about climate change growing substantially over the past few years.
The bad news is that growing climate awareness is mainly taking place among Democrats; the Republican base is largely unmoved.
And the anti-environmental extremism of conservative politicians has, if anything, become even more intense as their position has become intellectually untenable. The right used to pretend that there was a serious scientific dispute about the reality of global warming and its sources. Now Republicans, and the Trump administration in particular, have simply become hostile to science in general. Hey, aren’t scientists effectively part of the deep state?
Furthermore, this isn’t just a U.S. problem. Even as Australia burns, its current government is reaffirming its commitment to coal and threatening to make boycotts of environmentally destructive businesses a crime.
The sick irony of the current situation is that anti-environmentalism is getting more extreme precisely at the moment when the prospects for decisive action should be better than ever.
On one side, the dangers of climate change are no longer predictions about the future: We can see the damage now, although it’s only a small taste of the horrors that lie ahead.
On the other side, drastic reductions in greenhouse gas emissions now look remarkably easy to achieve, at least from an economic point of view. In particular, there has been so much technological progress in alternative energy that the Trump administration is trying desperately to prop up coal against competition from solar and wind.
So will environmental policy play a role in the 2020 campaign? Most Democrats seem disinclined to make it a major issue, and I understand why: Historically, the threat posed by right-wing environmental policy seemed abstract, distant and hard to run on compared with, say, Republican attempts to dismantle Obamacare.
But the wave of climate-related catastrophes may be changing the political calculus. I’m not a campaign expert, but it seems to me that campaigns might get some traction with ads showing recent fires and floods and pointing out that Donald Trump and his friends are doing everything they can to create more such disasters.
For the truth is that Trump’s environmental policy is the worst thing he’s doing to America and the world. And voters should know that.

The 'Imminent' Distraction; Soleimani was waging war on the U.S. He could be targeted at any time.

Texto completo: Journalism is supposed to make events clearer, but too often in Washington it obfuscates. Witness the obsession on the Sunday TV news shows over whether the threat from Qasem Soleimani was "imminent."
On "Meet the Press," host Chuck Todd highlighted or asked about the "imminent" point no fewer than seven times, four times with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Mr. Todd: "So was the justification in that he's been this destabilizing force in the region for so long? Or was the justification this imminent threat?"
Mr. Pompeo: "Chuck, it's never one thing. You've been at this a long time. The American people are smart, too. It's never one moment. It's never one instance. It's a collective. It's a full situational awareness of risk and analysis."
Mr. Todd wasn't satisfied, so he then unleashed the query on Mark Warner, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee: "How imminent does it seem? And is it any different than what Soleimani's been doing over the last decade?"
Mr. Warner: "I accept the notion that there was a real threat. The question of how imminent is something that I need more information on."
Don't bother, Senator. If the threat to Americans from Soleimani was real, it doesn't matter under international law whether the threat was "imminent." The traditional law of war couldn't be clearer on this point. If Soleimani was an enemy combatant waging war on the U.S., then the U.S. has every right to target him. If he was directing attacks on the U.S., as not even Chuck Todd doubts he was, then he can be legally targeted.
Some on the political left would like to change the law of war to adopt the "imminent" standard for the use of force. But this would hamstring law-abiding nations from preventing attacks until the moment they are about to happen. The standard would also give terrorists and rogue state actors more space and time to plot to kill Americans.
The Pentagon was careful not to use the word "imminent" in its statement after the killing of Soleimani, though a couple of spokesmen have emphasized the urgency of the intelligence threats. The New York Times followed with a weekend story quoting sources, unidentified of course, saying a threat wasn't imminent. The political point seems to be to delegitimize the killing of Soleimani.
But that is irrelevant. Soleimani was an enemy combatant waging war against America. His proxy forces targeted U.S. troops 11 times in recent months and stormed the U.S. Embassy last week. Killing him was justified under the laws of war and is a blow for deterrence against those who would kill Americans with impunity.

An optimistic history of the next decade

Texto completo: Looking back at the 2020s from our vantage point in 2030, the first great event was the complete destruction of Donald Trump's Republican Party. As the former Republican consultant Mike Murphy had noticed, there were roughly 300 state and federal elections during the Trump years and Republicans did horribly in most of them. The 2020 vote was a continuation of that trend. Trump's landslide defeat left him humiliated, and the Republicans lost their Senate majority.
Trump cried fraud and tried to whip up his followers, but they turned their backs. He went from idol to scapegoat in an instant. It seemed they could forgive him everything but losing. Many temporarily retreated from political life, the way evangelical Christians did after the ignominy of the Scopes trial.
President Joe Biden faced an interesting dynamic in his party. The political power was with moderates. The intellectual power was with the left. People of color, whose views were largely more moderate, became the crucial swing faction.
As president, Biden resisted the interest groups that wanted him to address health care first. Instead, he did child and earned-income tax credits, infrastructure, expanded early childhood education, expanded prison reform, and so on - what some writers called "reparations by any other name." He gave regulatory czar Elizabeth Warren a special portfolio to take on Big Tech.
The major events of the decade were cultural, not political. The Trump era had witnessed a crisis of connection at the bottom of society and a crisis of authority at the top. Social repair was the top order of the day once a new president took office.
The first whiff of the cultural restoration was the "Accountability Clubs" that spread across the nation's campuses. College students realized that America stinks at accountability. Either there is no accountability (Wall Street after the financial crisis) or people have their lives destroyed for a "problematic" tweet.
The Accountability Clubs bore the motto "Truth and Mercy." Students wanted to restore a culture in which facts mattered. They were also searching for a way to judge others in a graduated and humane manner, allowing for repentance, forgiveness and restoration. Marshall McLuhan once remarked that "moral indignation is a technique used to endow an idiot with dignity." Suddenly indignation, the keystone emotion of the Trump years, was lame. Empathy made a comeback.
The second cultural trend of the decade was the rise of the urban church. Suburban megachurch attendance fell, because the pastors had disgraced themselves under Trump. But suddenly there was a surge in church plants in places like Brooklyn, Washington, D.C., Chicago and San Francisco, as highly educated people found homes for their spiritual longings.
The churches were liturgically highly charismatic (Bethel music) and highly universalistic and intellectual (Richard Rohr). Their politics were an odd mix - pro-LGBTQ, pro-life, active on climate change, pro-animal rights (one of the signature moral causes of the decade). The religious left gained on the religious right.
At the same time, the racial justice conversation went intimate. America is involved in a multigenerational process of truth and reconciliation. In the teens, the truth-telling had generally revolved around historic events - slavery, lynching, redlining. In the 2020s, a series of writers, artists and directors gave us vivid descriptions of the subtleties of contemporary black life.
The profusion of video streaming networks allowed a new generation of artists to take audiences inside the psychological lives of people of color. These artists realized that structural change would happen when people learned to see one another whole.
The most important cultural change came to be known as the Civic Renaissance. During the first two decades of the century, hundreds of thousands of new civic organizations came into being - healing political divides, fighting homelessness, promoting social mobility and weaving communities. But these organizations were small. They did not grow into the big national chapter-based structures that had repaired America's social fabric a century earlier - the YMCA, the Rotary, the Boy Scouts.
By the 2020s, philanthropists and community builders realized the only way to change culture and weave the social fabric was by creating an AFL-CIO of civil society, with big national voices and large, decentralized national organizations so that people across America had easy and practical pathways to get involved in community revival.
In the 2010s, it seemed like the liberal order was cracking up. In the 2020s, that feeling vanished. The decline of the Chinese economy delegitimized the authoritarian model. It turns out you can't run a centrally controlled economy without a lot of waste, corruption and riot police.
Meanwhile, the American political system began to work better. The GOP re-emerged under Josh Hawley and Marco Rubio as a better version of a working-class party - socially right, economically left. Democrats remained dominant through the decade. Their party's biggest accomplishment was in foreign affairs - the repair of America's alliances and the restoration of global American leadership.
Americans were more collaborative in the 2020s. And the New York Mets won the World Series every single year.

Texto completo: Michael Eric Dyson is a sociology professor at Georgetown University, a New York Times contributing opinion writer and a contributing editor of the New Republic and the Undefeated. His 21st book, "Jay-Z: Made in America," was released in November.
You call Jay-Z "Robert Frost with a Brooklyn accent, Rita Dove with a Jesus piece."
And I argue that even though he's world famous and globally acclaimed, he's really underrated for the kind of sophisticated nuanced deployment of homophones, metonymy, simile, metaphor, braggadocio, allusion. That stuff is just dripping throughout his lyrics. Plus, he's putting that poetry to music. He's rapping to a beat. It's pretty remarkable that he does this without writing a single word down. It's like Homer, you know, in terms of an oral tradition. He's able to say what he has to say and record how he thinks and feels with such accuracy and poignancy. And to command a wide range of reference to culture and pop culture and intellectual culture. So, it was a delicious treat to be able to share some of that stuff in the book, stuff I've been discovering over the years in teaching a class on him.
In talking about Jay-Z and what he means to America, you talk about hustle and how that's such a distinctly American trait or tradition.
Exactly. Conservative historian Walter McDougall (argues) that the central motif of American history is hustling. It defines us in terms of ambition, desire - whether (for) people on the make, on the take or trying to make something of their lives. And I wanted to connect it to what Jay-Z is doing and what these young men and women are doing in many of these communities that are not regarded very highly. And yet, what they are about is quintessentially American. The impulse, the energy, the desire to do something, make something out of nothing. Jay-Z is one of the most powerful, if not the most powerful, emblems of that hustling ethic at the heart of American culture because the energy, the power, the imagination garnered on those cutthroat corners are then subsequently transformed into successful behavior in the aboveground economy in legitimate spheres of work that allow them to apply what they learned on the streets in the broader arenas of American enterprise.
Do you remember the first time you heard a Jay-Z song?
Yeah: "Can't Knock the Hustle." When I heard the entire album, I was, like, "Wow." I mean, he's giving us the Mafioso story, the narrative crafted about the gangster - but it was the remorse, the regret, the grief, the horror, the suffering. The album has a song called "Regrets." In order to be successful in that hustling life, you got to learn to live with regrets. You know, the existential anxiety of the hustling life. A figure on the underside of the American society, the other side of the law, the underground, but who's thinking about the moral and ethical implications of what he's doing. And trying to grapple with that and piece together his worldview from the fragments of his broken life.
Did any of that resonate with your own growing up?
I could definitely identify with it. I could understand where it came from, what forces drove it and what the consequences would be to an uncritical embrace and celebration of some of the ways of life that were being amplified in that music.
I grew up in Detroit, and it was a very violent place. (I was) part of a gang at a certain period - but got a chance to escape that. I was identified by my teachers as a relatively gifted student. So I got a scholarship to go to a private secondary school - a very elite one - Cranbrook. It was the first time I had gone to school with white kids. And it was too much. You know: No white kids you go to school with (until) you're 16, 17, and then you're going with very rich white kids. It was a real trauma, in a certain way, for me. That was my first sustained exposure to explicit racism. This was the time "Roots" came out. And somebody had taken a caricature from the newspaper, a rendering of some of the "Roots" characters and put on my dorm door: "N----- go home." It was an eye-opening experience. I made some bad choices. Got kicked out of school. Went back to the 'hood, you know: golden boy tarnished. Got a GED and (became) a teen father.
You have a history of taking popular, talented, African American men and looking critically at them, but there's not a lot of criticism in this book. Jay-Z's a beloved figure, but there are lyrics that are problematic to a lot of people. And it comes off that you're sort of giving him a pass on (the language) - and on his recent controversial NFL deal.
I acknowledge the unfortunate use of tropes and metaphors that are connected to misogyny. And I've written extensively about lyrics, not just his, but what hip-hop has done in general with women and so on. From my first book on. So I've covered that territory. But what I wanted to do in this book is to really meditate upon the kind of solemnity and dignity of an evolved figure who's come to grips with his own intellectual and aesthetic expression and his own commitments. And whether we agree with them or not, to understand them in the context of a broad sweep and appreciation for what he was up against and what he made out of what was presented to him. I do an extensive analysis of his music, his lyrics, the poetic devices, to show just what we're missing when we have a narrow, one-dimensional interpretation of a figure like that.
I've acknowledged the genius of (Bill) Cosby but criticized him. Marvin Gaye, Martin Luther King Jr. and so on. So, in this book, I hope I've earned that right to be able - not to give him a pass because I happen actually to think that it's not either/or. It's not either Colin Kaepernick and kneeling or Jay-Z and dealing and wheeling. We need both. And I do make that argument. The either/or-ism, I think, is problematic. I think we have to have a far longer historical overview and an appreciation for both the flaws and tremendous features of a human being or a life.
How do you negotiate that political correctness on campus in order to maintain critical discourse?
I'm for more rather than less speech. I'm for free speech. I'm for people even expressing difficult and complicated and horrible ideas in an environment where their language will not reinforce the vulnerability of others, however. I think that has to be held in check, and we have to protect people. Because if your exercise of free speech undercuts my ability to exist, then we're not talking about free speech. We're talking about reins of terror that are rooted in a fascist narcissism that needs to be checked. On the other hand, if some right-wing conservative is saying something you don't want to hear, then you got to listen. This is the world in which we live. Let's engage people. Let's talk to them. Let's challenge them. Let's know enough to disagree with them and go up against what they're talking about.
I mean, I lecture mostly in places and spaces that are not necessarily organically empathic to my viewpoint. Every week, when I leave out of here, and I go lecture at some school - some predominantly white institution where folks might be a little bit more disturbed by my willingness to kind of be open and honest about what I believe. And I tell the white folks, just stick around. You think I'm tough on you? I'm tough on everybody. But you only hear your issue. You don't hear me when I challenge the black church about homophobia. Or misogyny. Or sexism. You're just seeing it through your prism, and you're getting upset. Ironically, these are the very people talking about P.C. who can't stand the articulation of an unapologetic black voice that doesn't kowtow or cower to them.

Texto completo: MAGADAN, Russia - Like many young people in Magadan, a frigid northern Russian city more than 3,600 miles from Moscow, Dinat Yur is fed up with living in a place where winters drag on for six months and the average annual temperature is below freezing.
"I really dream of leaving this place," said Yur, a 29-year-old cook. "I can't wait."
Born and raised in a city proud of its resilience against climatic and all other odds, Yur has for the moment found his calling in a defiantly contrarian occupation for a place so cold: He makes ice cream.
As the temperature in Magadan dipped the other week to well below freezing - on its way to -58 degrees Fahrenheit once winter really sets in - he was hard at work mixing milk, sugar and a raspberry mush imported from Italy to produce a summery swirl of frozen gelato.
Eating his confections outside during winter, Yur conceded, is not a good idea - they quickly turn to teeth-cracking chunks of ice - but "everyone here likes to sit at home in front of the TV with some ice cream."
Russia's curious love affair with ice cream has long been a subject of theorizing about how a country plagued by such terrible weather and other miserable conditions manages to keep going, prevailing over seemingly insurmountable hurdles.
Particularly popular in Russia is a story, probably apocryphal, about a visit to Moscow in the winter of 1944 by Winston Churchill that has Britain's wartime leader noticing Muscovites eating ice cream on a snowy street from his car window and declaring "such a people will never be conquered."
Moscow, however, has winters that usually hover in the 20s - meaning that Magadan is pushing the limits of this against-the-odds spirit.
Burdened by its Stalin-era beginnings as the gateway to a string of brutal labor camps in nearby Kolyma - where tens of thousands were executed and more than 100,000 died of disease and hunger - the city is trying to rebrand itself cheerily as the "golden heart of Russia," a reference to vast reserves of gold buried in nearby mountains.
Built on an icy bay overlooking the Sea of Okhotsk, north of Japan, Magadan is Russia's version of Dawson City, the Canadian town created by the Klondike Gold Rush at the end of the 19th century. Only Russians never rushed to Magadan; they were dragged there.
The only recent rush has been to the exit.
Young people particularly are making a run for it, a stampede that the city's mayor, Yuri Grishin, has worked to slow. He points to a new sports complex now under construction, a rash of restaurant openings and fresh licks of paint for buildings in the center of town as possible encouragement for people to stay put.
After years of dramatic decline that slashed the population by more than 40%, the mayor said the number of residents has now "more or less stabilized" at around 91,000.
But among those who have moved away are the mayor's own three grown children. One now lives in Moscow.
The mayor does not understand. Why would anyone trade Magadan for the capital, where "they will live in a tiny apartment and spend three hours a day in traffic jams," he asked.
Aside from its bleak weather and even bleaker history, Magadan is, if truth be told, no worse - and in some respects better - than many provincial Russian towns. It has the same crumbling concrete apartment blocks, the same colonnaded theater building, the same central square formerly named after Lenin and the same street slogans celebrating victory in the Great Patriotic War, as Russia refers to World War II.
It also has three movie houses, two indoor public swimming pools, a well-deserved reputation for camaraderie and a huge new Orthodox cathedral with glittering golden domes, an indispensable feature of urban planning in the age of President Vladimir Putin.
Another plus is climate change, which is making winters somewhat milder. It did not start snowing heavily this year until late November.
When the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, Magadan had 155,000 people. They were a mix of locally born residents - many of them descendants of former gulag prisoners, guards or administrators - and outsiders attracted by salaries that had for years been far higher than in the rest of the country. That was thanks to the "northern bonus," a Soviet-era premium offered to anyone willing to work there.
But for many people in Magadan, the end of the Soviet Union meant economic ruin. The slashing of Soviet-era subsidies sent Magadan salaries tumbling. As factories closed and services withered, some free-market zealots in Moscow suggested that the city be put out of its misery and shut down.
Putin, though, has done the opposite, stressing the importance of keeping remote northern outposts alive, no matter the cost. His calculations include security, patriotic pride in Russia's reach, and economics: Most of Russia's natural resources lie beneath the ice and snow of places like Magadan and the nearby wilds.
While Magadan is blessed with rich supplies of gold, silver and other natural resources, conditions are so harsh that some economists still question whether it makes sense to keep it as a city rather than just a transit center for contract workers heading for the mines.
But giving up on Magadan as a functioning urban center would effectively return it to its original role when it was founded in 1929 - a grim seaport through which geologists and then gulag laborers passed on their way to the gold mines of Kolyma. Alexander Solzhenitsyn, the author of "The Gulag Archipelago," described this particular outpost of the gulag as "the pole of cold and cruelty."
When Solzhenitsyn returned to Russia in 1994 after years of exile in Vermont, he made Magadan his first stop, explaining upon his arrival from Alaska that he had "come to bow to the land where many hundreds of thousands of our countrymen, who were executed, are buried."
Because of the flight of young people, Magadan now has a severe shortage of able-bodied workers. The mayor said the city needed 20,000 more people to do construction and other work and is making do in the meantime by bringing in workers on short-term contracts.
"It upsets me that people have this stereotype of Magadan as a big prison camp," the mayor said. The city, he added, is "repositioning itself as a bright, colorful and happy place."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - U.S. intelligence agencies face a significant reduction in their counterterrorism collection efforts in Africa if a proposed withdrawal of U.S. military forces is carried out by the Pentagon, intelligence officials said.
The new planning to pull back intelligence officers deployed in Western Africa and other parts of the continent has been partly driven by the troop deployment review, which is expected to reduce U.S. forces in Niger, Nigeria and other countries in the region.
The presence of U.S. troops allows intelligence officers to travel far from traditional diplomatic outposts. The troops also provide protection in the event of spreading chaos or instability. Stark evidence of the risk was seen in the lethal 2012 attacks in Benghazi, Libya, and increased security was ordered for those outposts.
If service members are soon pulled out of Africa, the CIA and other intelligence agencies simply would not be able to safely deploy their officers far beyond embassy walls, officials say.
One intelligence official called the potential shift of CIA officers out of Africa stunningly dangerous. The decision would not just hurt the United States' ability to detect and stop terrorism threats, the official said, but also hinder its ability to collect intelligence about what rival nations, like Russia and China, are doing in Africa.
While it is difficult to assess how much of an intelligence deficit would follow a troop pullback, the loss would be real, said Nicholas J. Rasmussen, the former director of the National Counterterrorism Center.
"With a smaller military and intelligence presence, we limit how much intelligence we collect. Our analysts have a less rich pool of information on which to draw when reaching conclusions and forecasting threat conditions," said Rasmussen, the acting executive director of Arizona State University's McCain Institute. "Our confidence levels in the analysis we produce end up being lower."
Trump administration officials would not say how many intelligence officers could be affected by the changes because the number of officers in the field is a closely guarded secret.
The pullback of intelligence officers is not driven only by the planned troop reductions. Counterterrorism officials are also being asked to rethink their work and narrow their focus to the most dangerous terrorist groups, according to current and former intelligence officials.
After the Sept. 11 attacks, the United States shifted resources to fighting terrorism. While most of those were focused on groups like al-Qaida and then the Islamic State, both with the reach to orchestrate or inspire attacks on the United States homeland, U.S. military and intelligence agencies also built up resources against regional terrorism threats.
The Trump administration, hoping to prevent the United States from becoming entangled in more long wars, wants the military and intelligence forces to scale down their ambitions. Under the plans now being discussed, fewer resources would be allocated to monitoring regional threats - terrorist groups that might spout anti-American speech but do not have the wherewithal to mount a significant attack on U.S. territory.
Rasmussen said no terrorist organization in Africa so far had successfully been able to attack the American homeland, giving credence to the idea that too much emphasis had been put on such groups. But without military and intelligence personnel on the ground, working with partner nations to help combat regional terrorist organizations, it becomes difficult to assess which groups have or could have the capabilities to mount an attack on the United States, Rasmussen said.
"If our intelligence picture is degraded significantly by a drawdown in presence, we run the risk of failing to collect that critical bit of intelligence that might give us insight on the capability part of the equation," Rasmussen said.
The shift, military and intelligence officials said, is also part of an effort to move resources toward countering the rise of China and to more adroitly compete with Beijing.
But some U.S. officials believe that cutting back the intelligence and military presence will reduce the United States' clout in Africa at the very time it is becoming a front line in the influence battle with Russia and China.
The three nations are jostling for prominence in sub-Saharan Africa. Russia's mercenary force, the Wagner Group, has had a presence in the Central African Republic and other countries, said Sean McFate, a professor at the National Defense University and the author of "The New Rules of War." China has a military support base in Djibouti and is using its Belt and Road Initiative to expand its connections throughout the continent.
"Where we are competing with China is in Africa," McFate said. "It seems shortsighted to cede the field. It is strategically myopic to move intelligence - which is the only way we are going to find out on the ground in these places - out of the region."
Some intelligence officials insist that even if U.S. military forces or CIA officers are collecting less front-line intelligence, analysts in Washington can still draw valuable insights and warnings on terrorist threats.
But McFate said gathering knowledge about Africa was not like Eastern Europe during the years when U.S. intelligence focused on the communist threat. A diplomat sitting in the capital simply cannot assess the strength of a terrorist group operating in a distant province, or the influence of Russian or Chinese mercenary companies.McFate said that as the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq wind down, there is a weariness with counterinsurgency operations. But pulling troops and intelligence officers out of Africa as a reaction to the exhaustion with "forever wars" is a strategic error, he said.
"America has lost an appetite for counterinsurgency; they just think of this as a never-ending war," he said. "It is a reaction to that, but it is a strategic misstep."

Harvey Weinstein Set to Stand Trial on Sex-Crime Charges; Allegations against Hollywood producer helped to spawn #MeToo movement

Texto completo: Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein is headed for trial this week on narrow charges that he sexually assaulted two women. But the trial, of the man whose alleged actions helped to spawn the #MeToo movement, is being closely watched, with cultural implications that go beyond its legal ones.
The sexual-misconduct allegations against Mr. Weinstein , first reported by the New York Times and the New Yorker magazine in 2017, helped release a flood of accusations against other men, many from women who had remained silent for decades. Mr. Weinstein's trial, which is expected to last about two months, is set to begin on Monday in state court in Manhattan.
If found guilty, Mr. Weinstein faces up to life in prison.
Mr. Weinstein, who believes he has been treated unfairly, has repeatedly denied having nonconsensual sex and said his accomplishments have been forgotten. "I made more movies directed by women and about women than any filmmaker," he told the New York Post in December.
Mr. Weinstein has been publicly accused of sexual misconduct by more than 80 women. Inside the courtroom, he faces five criminal counts: two counts of rape, one count of criminal sexual act and two counts of predatory sexual assault, a felony that includes committing sex crimes against multiple people. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges.
The charges revolve around different alleged incidents with two women. A former production assistant, Mimi Haleyi, alleges that Mr. Weinstein forced oral sex on her in 2006 at his Manhattan apartment. A second, unnamed accuser says the Hollywood producer raped her at a Manhattan hotel in 2013.
The account of a third woman, "The Sopranos" actress Annabella Sciorra, is expected to be used to bolster a predatory-sexual-assault count. Ms. Sciorra claims Mr. Weinstein raped her in her Manhattan apartment during the early 1990s.
The judge has also allowed testimony from three women who say they were assaulted by Mr. Weinstein but aren't part of the charges. These women are expected to present evidence that prosecutors say will help establish a pattern of behavior. Prosecutors rarely use the tactic because it can unfairly prejudice a jury, though it was employed in the second sexual-assault trial of entertainer Bill Cosby, who was convicted in 2018 .
After some logistical matters Monday, the lawyers on Tuesday will turn to jury selection, which will likely take several weeks.
Lawyers for Mr. Weinstein are expected to argue that sex with his accusers was consensual. In legal filings, his former lawyers had suggested that they would use his accusers' text messages and emails to undermine their accounts.
In one message, sent several months after the alleged rape, Ms. Haleyi texted Mr. Weinstein's phone, writing: "Hi! Just wondering if u have any news on whether harvey will have time to see me before he leaves? x Miriam." She signed another message, "Lots of love."
A lawyer for Ms. Haleyi didn't respond to a request for comment.
Mr. Weinstein's pivotal role in the #MeToo movement has resulted in outsize cultural interest in the trial.
Supporters of the #MeToo movement are looking to the case for legal affirmation, said Rebecca Roiphe, a New York Law School professor and former Manhattan prosecutor.
"Especially after Epstein's suicide , the left is looking for a legal win, for a situation in which they can say, 'Our cultural movement is going to have a broader effect now because there's a strong message sent from the courtroom,'" Prof. Roiphe said, referring to the financier Jeffrey Epstein, who apparently killed himself in his Manhattan jail cell rather than face trial on charges of sex trafficking.
Some lawyers feared that an acquittal could have a chilling effect on accusers' willingness to cooperate with future prosecutions.
"If Weinstein wins this criminal trial and he puts these victims through the wringer, it will discourage other victims from coming forward in the future," said David Ring, a Los Angeles sex-abuse lawyer who represents a Weinstein accuser who isn't part of the Manhattan case. "They'll say, 'What's the point?'"
Sex-crime charges can be extremely difficult to prove. Older claims, such as those in the Weinstein case, typically lack forensic evidence since accusers didn't immediately report the incidents or see a doctor. Evidence often rests on "he said she said" accounts and people whom an accuser may have spoken to after an alleged incident.
Cultural issues aside, the verdict will hinge on the specific charges at trial, which carry a high burden of proof, said Elizabeth Tippett, a University of Oregon law professor who studies #MeToo's legal implications.
"If the trial does not resolve in a way that holds Weinstein accountable, it might be easy to forget that it happened in a particular procedural context," she said.

Texto completo: U.S. intelligence agencies face a significant reduction in their counterterrorism collection efforts in Africa if a proposed withdrawal of U.S. military forces is carried out by the Pentagon, intelligence officials said.
The new planning to pull back intelligence officers deployed in Western Africa and other parts of the continent has been partly driven by the troop deployment review, which is expected to reduce U.S. forces in Niger, Nigeria and other countries in the region.
The presence of U.S. troops allows intelligence officers to travel far from traditional diplomatic outposts. The troops also provide protection in the event of spreading chaos or instability. Stark evidence of the risk was seen in the lethal 2012 attacks in Benghazi, Libya, and increased security was ordered for those outposts.
If service members are soon pulled out of Africa, the CIA and other intelligence agencies simply would not be able to safely deploy their officers far beyond embassy walls, officials say.
One intelligence official called the potential shift of CIA officers out of Africa stunningly dangerous. The decision would not just hurt the United States' ability to detect and stop terrorism threats, the official said, but also hinder its ability to collect intelligence about what rival nations, like Russia and China, are doing in Africa.
While it is difficult to assess how much of an intelligence deficit would follow a troop pullback, the loss would be real, said Nicholas J. Rasmussen, the former director of the National Counterterrorism Center.
"With a smaller military and intelligence presence, we limit how much intelligence we collect. Our analysts have a less rich pool of information on which to draw when reaching conclusions and forecasting threat conditions," said Rasmussen, the acting executive director of Arizona State University's McCain Institute. "Our confidence levels in the analysis we produce end up being lower."
Trump administration officials would not say how many intelligence officers could be affected by the changes because the number of officers in the field is a closely guarded secret.
The pullback of intelligence officers is not driven only by the planned troop reductions. Counterterrorism officials are also being asked to rethink their work and narrow their focus to the most dangerous terrorist groups, according to current and former intelligence officials.
After the Sept. 11 attacks, the United States shifted resources to fighting terrorism. While most of those were focused on groups like al-Qaida and then the Islamic State, both with the reach to orchestrate or inspire attacks on the United States homeland, U.S. military and intelligence agencies also built up resources against regional terrorism threats.
The Trump administration, hoping to prevent the United States from becoming entangled in more long wars, wants the military and intelligence forces to scale down their ambitions. Under the plans now being discussed, fewer resources would be allocated to monitoring regional threats -- terrorist groups that might spout anti-American speech but do not have the wherewithal to mount a significant attack on U.S. territory.
Rasmussen said no terrorist organization in Africa so far had successfully been able to attack the American homeland, giving credence to the idea that too much emphasis had been put on such groups. But without military and intelligence personnel on the ground, working with partner nations to help combat regional terrorist organizations, it becomes difficult to assess which groups have or could have the capabilities to mount an attack on the United States, Rasmussen said.
The shift, military and intelligence officials said, is also part of an effort to move resources toward countering the rise of China and to more adroitly compete with Beijing.
But some U.S. officials believe that cutting back the intelligence and military presence will reduce the United States' clout in Africa at the very time it is becoming a front line in the influence battle with Russia and China.
The three nations are jostling for prominence in sub-Saharan Africa. Russia's mercenary force, the Wagner Group, has had a presence in the Central African Republic and other countries, said Sean McFate, a professor at the National Defense University and the author of "The New Rules of War." China has a military support base in Djibouti and is using its Belt and Road Initiative to expand its connections throughout the continent.
McFate said that as the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq wind down, there is a weariness with counterinsurgency operations. But pulling troops and intelligence officers out of Africa as a reaction to the exhaustion with "forever wars" is a strategic error, he said.

Texto completo: 'Doppelgänger'
By Dasa Drndic, translated by S.D. Curtis and Celia Hawkesworth, 156 pages, New Directions, $15.95
This month, Merriam-Webster named the pronoun "they" its word of the year. Runners-up included "quid pro quo," "impeach" and, for good measure, "egregious" -- as thrifty a description of 2019 as we could hope for.
But what if lexicographers did us the favor of not only anointing words but annually retiring a few that have been embraced too exuberantly and look a little shabby for it -- a little dazed to find themselves miles from their original meanings.
"Witness" (as in "the act of witness," "bearing witness" and all its vacant subsidiaries) would be high on my list. A complicated notion has been breezily expanded so that any chronicle, any memoir might wear the mantle with unembarrassed self-regard. Why write when you can "witness"? A form that was once both proud and uneasy about the price it exacted from writer and reader now seems to demand so little of itself.
I had forgotten how great the cost could be when I came (shamefully late) to the gory, majestic work of Croatian novelist Dasa Drndic, who died last year at 71. Fewer than half of her 13 novels have been translated into English, many with the scrupulous care of Celia Hawkesworth. The linked novels "Belladonna" and "EEG" have recently been published, along with "Doppelgänger," an earlier work, her favorite of her novels -- this "ugly little book of mine," she joked, wondering if it was too repulsive for readers. (S.D. Curtis co-translated "Doppelgänger" with Hawkesworth.)
Drndic is often described as a blend of Beckett (for the bleakness and rhythms), W.G. Sebald (the reliance on photographs and interest in historical amnesia) and Thomas Bernhard (first-rate misanthropy), but these sorts of comparisons do nothing to convey the singular experience of reading her work.
This writer does not tell stories; she had flagrant contempt for them -- those cozy bourgeois tchotchkes that belonged to a safer time, when retreat from the political was permissible. Her books are contraptions intended to produce a series of psychological and somatic responses in her readers. In short: panic, pity, shame, nausea, exhilaration -- and then, the bewildering desire to experience these very emotions again.
These are not books to be read but endured. I resumed all my old vices to survive them, and adopted a few new ones. I developed warm, fraternal feelings for Job. "Art should shock, hurt, offend, intrigue, be a merciless critic of the merciless times we are not only witnessing but whose victims we have become," Drndic once said. She wanted her rhythm and repetition to "irritate," and struck any flourishes that might "sweeten" the prose. She wanted her novels to feel like a punch in the stomach. The books frequently open with a startling image, something frightening, but also quite funny or gently obscene -- an old man registering the fullness of his diaper, in "Doppelgänger." It's as if the writer is testing us.
For much of her career, her great subject was the former Yugoslavia's unacknowledged role in the Holocaust, the butchery of the fascist Ustasha puppet state established by the Nazis. (Drndic's father was a leader of the anti-fascist movement.) "In Germany and Austria, almost 70 years after the end of the war, ever new serials of undigested Nazi trauma keep appearing," Drndic's alter ego Andreas Ban laments in "Belladonna." "In Croatia, in a patriotic trance, Ustasha crimes and their perpetrators dress up in carnival robes of rotten nostalgia, their descendants keep quiet or lie about their fathers' and grandfathers' pasts."
The characters in her novels, however, give themselves over to voluptuous grief. Complicity rots them from within. Andreas Ban immures himself in his apartment on a mission to amputate his memories, trying to forswear speech, and even thought, while his body goes to ruin with breast cancer, hemorrhoids, glaucoma. In "Doppelgänger," a man spends his life cutting little holes in his shoulders, belly and thighs with a pair of nail scissors. He attempts to return his family's silver to the original Jewish owners and ends up, like so many of Drndic's characters, killing himself.
Damage to heads, mouths, lips are common in these novels. So too are references to asthma, lung disease and cancer, pulmonary obstructions. Drndic's fondness for commas gives her sentences their peculiar gasping quality. The characters choke on what they cannot, will not, say.
Sebald once counseled against depicting horror too directly, particularly where the Holocaust was concerned. "We've all seen images," he said, referring to the concentration camps, "but these images militate against our capacity for discursive thinking, for reflecting upon these things." They "paralyze, as it were, our moral capacity." To tell such stories effectively demanded a degree of canniness and obliquity to sidestep reflexive responses and surprise readers into fresh feeling and seeing. In Drndic, however, everything is depicted bluntly and head-on.
Everything is to be faced. While being treated for cancer, Drndic told critic Eileen Battersby how "fascinated" she was by the pain radiotherapy produced in her bones. When she knew she was dying, she threw herself a farewell party at a favorite bookshop.
This desire for directness is best exemplified by the obsession with naming that runs through her novels. In "Trieste," the narrative is interrupted by a 40-page list that names the Jews who met their deaths in Italy or were deported to camps from Italy between 1943 and 1945. One of Drndic's British publishers recalled a London event at which a copy of the book was passed around and the audience told to tear out pages on which they recognized a name -- "the book lost its form, as a society does when an element is removed." In "Belladonna," a list names the 2,061 Jewish children sent to camps from the Netherlands between 1938 and 1945. In "EEG," she lists chess players exterminated by the Nazis or lost to suicide.
"History remembers the names of the perpetrators, not the victims," Andreas Ban says in "EEG," Drndic's last completed novel. He shares his creator's preoccupation. He "obsessively" names people, he says, "because I see more and more clearly that this, their name, is perhaps the last cobweb thread that separates them from general, universal chaos, from the cauldron of turbid, stale mash."
Is this true? Reading these names aloud slowly, carefully, is an overwhelming experience. But does it single out and rescue any particular individual from history? The opposite seems true: The names run together. What hooks them into the brain is something different. In the list of the children's names in "Belladonna," it is their ages -- Clara Deborah Van Leeuwen (4 months), Sara Stad (3) -- that makes each one suddenly so unique and irreplaceable. It is the clumping together of certain surnames (Leons and Weis) -- were they siblings? It is detail, story and selection that propel some of these names out of the enveloping oblivion.
Detail, story, selection are traits that Drndic grew to disdain as her work grew ever more demanding and diffuse. She made a ethic of sprawl and amplitude. In her final work, "EEG," Andreas Ban, who once refused speech, refused memory, allows himself to be inhabited by ghosts of history and his family. The narrative no longer belongs to him -- did it ever?
"Maybe none of us has his own life," Drndic once wrote. "Is your life unconditionally yours?"

Texto completo: When you’re putting on a show less than a decade after it won best new play, best director and best actor — first at the Olivier Awards in London and then at the Tony Awards, the Broadway equivalent — is it better to have seen the original or not to have seen it?
For the record, Mark Collmer, director of the ProArts Theater production of “The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time,” which opens Friday, has seen no more than a few clips of the much-honored Marianne Elliott production, enough to know that within what looked like an empty box, it packed more bells and whistles than you’ll find in a pinball arcade, and who could hope to compete with that?
Instead, Collmer, his creative team and his cast of 10 (six of them in multiple roles) have started with a clean slate, which is the right and proper thing to do.
As readers of Mark Haddon’s international bestseller and instant classic know, “The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time” presents itself as a murder mystery narrated by Christopher Boone, a special-needs 15-year-old who, just past midnight one night, discovers a neighbor’s poodle impaled on an upright garden fork. Briefly suspected of the crime, Christopher — a Sherlock Holmes fan — dons his figurative deerstalker to smoke out the killer, in the process turning on its head the world as he thinks he knows it.
That makes him a kind of latter-day Oedipus Rex, though in Christopher’s case there’s quite a lot of good news to counterbalance the catastrophes.
In the play, adapted by Simon Stephens, Christopher takes on the added duties of playwright, director and star of the show. He does so on assignment from Mrs. Gascoyne, the principal of his school, under the supervision of Siobhan, the paraprofessional who is his mentor. And he does so against his will.
“I don’t like acting,” he tells Siobhan in the play, “because it is pretending that something is real when it is not really real at all, so it is like a kind of lie.” And Christopher never lies. (Well, hardly ever.)
What exactly are we to make of Christopher? The flap copy for the first edition of Haddon’s novel, published in 2002, spelled out the answer: “Christopher John Francis Boone knows all the countries of the world and their capitals and every prime number up to 7,057. He relates well to animals but has no understanding of human emotions. He cannot stand to be touched. Though gifted with a super­bly logical brain, Christopher is autistic.”
Like many another diagnostic label, this one has come under heavy political fire lately. Haddon has distanced himself from it on the grounds that he has no expertise in neurological and developmental disorders. His purpose, he has said, was to create a character.
By this he must have meant a unique personality, as opposed, that is, to some generic case study. Today, professionals and members of the affected community are at daggers drawn over the competing descriptors “neurodivergent” versus “neurologically divergent,” which may be a case of a distinction without a difference.
For what it’s worth, the neuropsychologist Rodger Meinz, who has consulted in well over 100 work-related cases involving Asperger’s syndrome, likens Christopher to Mr. Potato Head: “Rather than present a ‘real’ case of Asperger’s,” Meinz said recently, “Haddon has artificially constructed one that Nature would never assemble in reality.”
On the one hand, Christopher’s powers as a savant are no great shakes by clinical standards. On the other hand, Haddon subjects Christopher to emotional, social and logistical trials by fire a “real” Christopher could no sooner handle than he could walk on water.
Note taken. But isn’t this precisely the reason why people tell stories? To imagine things that aren’t so or might not be so? What matters, as Haddon has insisted, is the story: the classic fable of an underdog who defies all odds. Aspirational or inspirational? Take your pick.
Caro Walker’s set design for ProArts looks like a project in solid geometry, intuitively an apt metaphor for the structure of Christopher’s mind. A dozen white boxes with slanting tops, configured this way and that within one white giant box, allows a seamless flow of action from place to place, back and forth in time, and at one euphoric moment of fantasy even into outer space.
To convey Christopher’s blindness to facial expression, the six players of the ensemble wear white masks, forcing the audience to “read” them, as Christopher does, by other cues, like tone and body language.
THE SHOCK of experiencing the world through Christopher’s eyes surely accounts for much of his appeal, both in the book and on the stage. Few recent parts have been so challenging while at the same time so rewarding.
Though the London and New York productions of shows like “Billy Elliot” and “Matilda” cast the title roles with age-appropriate child actors who were also fiendishly accomplished, Christopher’s prize-winning originators in those theater capitals only looked Christopher’s age. Luke Treadaway, 28, came trailing a long string of major theater and film credits; his 25-year-old Broadway counterpart, Alex Sharp, arrived fresh from the rigorous drama division of the Juilliard School.
Their surprise successor at ProArts is Molly Oberg, who, like Christopher, actually is 15 years old and the owner of a beloved rodent.
“When the ProArts auditions were announced,” Collmer says, “Molly sent an email to Lin McEwan, our executive director, asking if she could try out for Christopher and bring Miss Daisy, her pet rat.” Oberg may also have mentioned that “The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time” is her favorite book.
Though permission was granted, the part wasn’t exactly hers to lose. For one thing, based on his knowledge of the local talent pool, Collmer already had two other contenders in mind. As it happened, neither of them was available. Even so, in the end, Oberg was up against three potential Christophers: one cocky, one frisky, one nonchalant, each with his distinct appeal.
Which in itself may have proved their collective Achilles heel. Christopher doesn’t appeal. He doesn’t connect. He inhabits a world apart. At callbacks, Oberg alone conveyed that condition of isolation. Opaque, stubborn, vaguely robotic, she slipped into Christopher’s skin without even seeming to try. And on a viewer’s part, it took no great act of imagination to “read” her as a boy.
In the meantime the journey of rehearsals has been taking her further. At the first run-through, several weeks later, Oberg seemed here and there to be channeling Christopher even when out of character. When a scene partner misremembered a picky detail of the stage business, she matter-of-factly set her straight, just as Christopher does with other players elsewhere in the script.
It was telling, too, that, as often as not, Oberg phrased questions less like questions than blunt statements of fact.
In usual parlance, the notion of dramatic illusion describes the players’ power to make the spectator suspend disbelief. But what about when an actor begins to merge with a character? Surely, that’s a kind of dramatic illusion, too. If so, could that be what Oberg is creating?
When the paying customers arrive, we shall see what we shall see.

Texto completo: Four daily newspapers in Maine, including the Portland Press Herald, will cease production of their Monday print editions as of March 2 in a cost-cutting move to preserve newsroom jobs, according to their CEO.
The Press Herald, Lewiston Sun Journal, Morning Sentinel in Waterville and Kennebec Journal in Augusta each will continue to produce seven distinct editions per week, but their Monday editions will be available only in digital format, said Lisa DeSisto, CEO of Masthead Maine, which publishes the newspapers. Masthead is following an industry trend, spurred by declining print advertising revenue and increased digital news consumption, that has led at least 100 U.S. daily newspapers over the past 15 years to cut the number of print editions they produce each week.
"The savings from digital-only Monday enables us to keep our newsrooms at the size that they are and continue to produce the journalism that's important to our community," DeSisto said. "We know that we have a lot of work to do to get a portion of our customers comfortable with this, and we're committed to that smooth transition."
Masthead needs to reduce costs, she said, and the only alternative would be to cut newsroom staffing, which the company doesn't want to do. DeSisto declined to say how much money Masthead expects to save from the change to digital-only Mondays, but she noted that the bulk of savings will come from reduced paper and distribution costs.
She said Masthead is anticipating a "modest loss" of advertising revenue as a result of the change, but that the cost savings will more than make up for it. About 37 percent of the company's revenue came from print advertising in 2019.
No jobs will be eliminated as a result of the change, DeSisto said, although the company expects a reduction in overtime hours for printing press operators, as well as reduced schedules for a few part-time workers. Masthead papers are printed in house but delivered by independent contractors.
Masthead currently delivers major national newspapers such as the New York Times in addition to its own publications. DeSisto said the company will need to work out arrangements with those publishers to either deliver their Monday editions the following day or have them pay the contractor fees for Monday delivery.
The biggest hurdle for Masthead will be assuaging its many print-only subscribers who are used to reading the paper seven days a week. Masthead Group Vice President of Circulation Stefanie Manning said about 70 percent of the four newspapers' full-week subscribers have not registered for their digital offerings such as e-papers, mobile apps and websites.
Despite the move to reduce print output by one day a week, the company has no plans to cut the price of a full-week print subscription at any of the four affected newspapers. Instead, Masthead is planning a marketing and communications blitz to help those subscribers get signed up for digital access, Manning said.
"We know there is going to be a segment of our audience that isn't interested in digital access, or that don't have access to a computer, an email, (or) the internet in their home," she said. "We'll do everything that we can to nurture those customers through the process."
DeSisto said Masthead, which owns five of Maine's six daily newspapers, has no immediate plans to reduce print publication any further.
"We are committed to, and value, our print customers," she said. "We don't have any plans to further move to (another) digital-only day. How our business unfolds will dictate what's possible in the future."
The number of U.S. daily newspapers that print fewer than seven days a week is expected to increase dramatically starting this year, according to the University of North Carolina's Center for Innovation and Sustainability in Local Media. Since 2004, more than 100 newspapers have reduced their printing frequency enough to be reclassified from daily papers (printing three or more editions per week) to weekly papers (printing one or two editions per week), it said.
Major U.S. daily newspapers that have cut back on days with print editions over the past several years include the New Orleans Times-Picayune - one of the first to do so, in 2012 - and the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette - one of the most recent, in 2018.
Countless others have reduced their printing frequency while remaining dailies, often by eliminating their print editions on Mondays and/or Saturdays - typically the two least profitable days of the week. Masthead chose Monday because it is the company's weakest day of the week for print advertising, Manning said.
In an August 2019 report on newspaper strategies for reducing print publication days, David Ho of the American Press Institute said communicating with readers and advertisers is critical when eliminating print days. Publishers can use various tactics, from publishing articles, columns and ads, to holding meetings with community and business leaders and one-on-one discussions with subscribers, to help mitigate the loss of subscribers and advertising revenue, Ho said.
It's important that newspapers prepare adequately for any shift to digital-only content, he said, which includes developing strategies for winning back those who cancel their subscriptions as a result, and dealing with pushback from within the newspaper's own ranks.
Ho recommended a "deliberate route" to reducing print publication days as part of a larger strategy to promote long-term sustainability, rather than as an act of desperation in response to an alarming balance sheet.
"Cutting alone is not enough to ensure a newspaper will continue to exist and serve its community," he said in the report. "Publishers need a deeply planned and well-executed strategy, one that acknowledges that reader habits have moved beyond the seven-day daily paper. The approach must also deliver the quality content that audiences demand, to the technologies and platforms they currently use."
According to the report, some industry leaders believe it's inevitable that most newspapers ultimately will have to cut back print publication to their most profitable days of the week for print advertising - often Sunday, Wednesday and Friday - while producing digital-only content on the other days.
"Most publishers of dailies acknowledge that even in the best of times, there were only three days that were profitable," with those days effectively subsidizing losses the other days of the week, Penelope Muse Abernathy, Knight chair of journalism and digital media economics at UNC, said in the report.
In an interview Friday, Abernathy said the Sunday paper alone often accounts for 60 percent of a newspaper's profit. She said the biggest risk newspapers face when cutting back on unprofitable print days is not the loss of revenue but the possibility of turning off loyal daily readers.
"If you're going to transition (to digital-only days), you need to think about who your most loyal readers are, and how not to alienate them," Abernathy said. Other newspapers have employed a variety of tactics, including handing out tablet devices to loyal readers and teaching them how to use the devices, she said.
Masthead is a conglomeration of three discrete companies: MaineToday Media, which owns the Press Herald, the Kennebec Journal, the Morning Sentinel and a commercial printing operation in South Portland; Sun Media Group, which owns the Sun Journal in Lewiston and weeklies including The Forecaster, the American Journal and the Lakes Region Weekly; and Alliance Media Group, which owns the five-days-a-week Times Record in Brunswick and four free weeklies known collectively as the Mainely Media newspapers.
In October, Masthead closed Biddeford's daily newspaper, the Journal Tribune, after 135 years of publication. Masthead owner Reade Brower has said the paper had been shedding subscribers and advertisers for years before he acquired it in March 2018, and that his company had been unable to turn it around financially.
On Friday, Brower said that the move to digital-only Mondays is a prudent economic decision that will help build a sustainable model for the company's newspapers to survive and thrive into the future.
"It allows a lot of things to happen," he said. "It helps with the labor crunch, and it gives our drivers a day off, which I think will help us retain drivers."

Texto completo: A Greek chef who cooks Italian food is moving his restaurant this week into the former Anjon's Italian Restaurant at 521 Route 1 in Scarborough.
Anjon's, which served old-school Italian food in Maine for more than 60 years, closed in September.
Bob Rizk, the owner of Cobblestone Grille at 8 Heath St. in Old Orchard Beach, says he is leasing the building with an option to buy, and hopes to open Jan. 17.
Rizk will keep everything from Cobblestone Grille except the name, which will change to Amore on the Marsh. The menu and prices will remain the same, he said. But the move will at least quadruple his seating - Cobblestone Grill had just 50 seats, which meant customers often had to wait a half-hour or so for a table, Rizk said.
For now, Amore on the Marsh will be open for dinner Tuesday through Sunday. In the spring, the restaurant will be open every day and offer lunch as well.
'speakeasy barcade'
If all went well last night, the new owner of Pat's Pizza in Portland made good on his promise to open a speakeasy upstairs on New Year's Eve.
Mike Lizotte of Freeport, who also owns The Drink Exchange at 43 Wharf St., bought Pat's Pizza in August and said he planned to open something a little different upstairs - a speakeasy with a cassette tape-lined stairwell and telephone booth front door. Its grand opening was scheduled for Dec. 31. The new business at 32 Market St., called Pie North, is described as "the only Speakeasy Barcade in Maine," blending retro musical decor with classic arcade games.
'Restaurant: Impossible' 2.0
In 2014, Robert Irvine, host of the Food Network show "Restaurant: Impossible," which helps struggling restaurants get back on their feet, paid a visit to Uncle Andy's, a 65-year-old diner in South Portland's Knightville neighborhood.
On Sept. 14, Irvine and his crew returned to see how the diner and its owner, Dennis Fogg, are faring five years after its two-day, $10,000 makeover.
You can see Irvine's second impression of the diner when the Uncle Andy's return visit episode airs at 8 p.m. Thursday.
Gray says goodbye
Cole Farms, the Gray restaurant where friends and neighbors have gathered for a cup of coffee and a slice of pie for 68 years, is closing.
Calling it "a tough an emotional decision," owner Brad Pollard said the restaurant's last day will be Jan. 13.
The sprawling roadside restaurant at 64 Lewiston Road was founded in 1952 by two brothers. Originally a burger and ice cream stand, the 24-by-30-foot building that sprang up in a rocky pasture expanded to seat as many as 300 diners and employed thousands of locals over the years.

Texto completo: LOS ANGELES -- Sue Lyon, the actress who was forever tied to her teenage portrayal of the title role in 1962's "Lolita," died Thursday in Los Angeles. The news was first reported by the New York Times, and no cause of death was immediately given. She was 73.
"How did they ever make a movie of 'Lolita' " asked the ads for the film, director Stanley Kubrick's adaptation of Vladimir Nabokov's controversial novel about a man in his 40s who becomes obsessed with a young girl. James Mason, Peter Sellers and Shelley Winters also starred in the film.
"From the first, she was interesting to watch," Kubrick was quoted as saying of Lyon in Look magazine. "Even in the way she walked in for her interview, casually sat down, walked out. She was cool and non-giggly. She was enigmatic without being dull. She could keep people guessing about how much Lolita knew about life."
Born July 10, 1946, in Davenport, Iowa, Lyon was just 14 years old and had had only a few minor screen credits when she was said to beat out more than 800 other young women for the part in "Lolita." Lyon would go on to win a Golden Globe award for most promising female newcomer for her performance.
In 1964, writing in The Times, Hedda Hopper declared, "Sue Lyon is the arch prototype of an instant star."
Lyon would go on to appear in John Huston's 1964 adaptation of Tennessee Williams's "The Night of the Iguana" and John Ford's 1966 drama "7 Women." She continued to act steadily throughout the 1960s and 1970s in both film and television. Her last screen credit was in 1980's "Alligator."
Lyon was married five times, to Hampton Fancher (who would go on to be a screenwriter on "Blade Runner"), Roland Harrison, Cotton Adamson, Edward Weathers and Richard Rudman.
Adamson was a convict for second degree murder and robbery in Colorado at the time of their marriage in 1973. When they divorced only a year later, Lyon was quoted as saying, "I've been told by people in the movie business, specifically producers and film distributors, that I can't get a job because I'm married to Cotton. Therefore, right now we can't be married."
Lyon had a daughter, Nona, from her marriage to Harrison.
In a 1967 interview with The Times promoting the Frank Sinatra-starring movie "Tony Rome," Lyon, then all of 20 years old, said, "To be pretty and to stay pretty are two different things... You can't take anything for granted, and it's foolish to think you can. You have to think ahead of how to build health and happiness. You have to learn to avoid what is going to hurt you or someone else."

Trump's cellphone use puts nation at risk It's worse than Hillary Clinton use of a private email server for official business.

Texto completo: The Washington Post
The Kremlin might know more about conversations between President Trump, Rudy Giuliani and others involved in the Ukraine gambit that led to Congress' impeachment inquiry than congressional investigators themselves. The reason for this alarming reality? A dangerous fondness for cellphones.
Trump's insistence on using his personal cellphone for official communications was a problem the moment he stepped into the Oval Office - after a campaign spent railing against rival Hillary Clinton for sending state emails on a private server. Now, call records obtained by the House have resurrected concerns about how the president and his closest associates communicate about the most sensitive of matters, and who exactly might be listening.
Trump claims he relies exclusively on government-issued devices hardened against hacks. But last year, The New York Times reported he favored a mass-market iPhone for dialing his friends, and Chinese spies often eavesdropped for insights on how they might sway the administration. Even if all the commander in chief's phones are now specifically programmed for protection, there's still a risk if they're not routinely scrubbed or swapped out - measures Trump in the past allegedly declared "too inconvenient."
Security experts also say cellphones are generally more vulnerable than landlines. Adversaries eager to intercept privileged chats, for example, can "spoof" the towers through which calls are routed. John Kelly's success in getting Trump to move to White House channels was short-lived; the president discovered that meant the then-chief of staff could access a log of his calls, and he reverted to his old habits.
Even if Trump conducted conversations only from sanctified facilities such as the Situation Room, they would still be only as safe from surveillance as their recipient - which, as witness testimony these past few weeks has revealed, is not safe at all. Giuliani's communications, it seems, were not encrypted with any of the widely available services such as WhatsApp and Signal. Similarly, U.S. ambassadors speaking to the president are supposed to do so from an embassy on a secure line, not from a restaurant in Kiev on an unsecured cellphone.
The White House, in short, seems content to privilege convenience over secrecy. Barack Obama famously fought to keep his iPhone when he became president. He won, but the device he ended up with was so restricted for security's sake that using it, he said, was "no fun."
At least he understood that it wasn't supposed to be.

Texto completo: The Washington Post
Millions of smartphone users globally got an unpleasant surprise this holiday season. ToTok, one of those "free, fast and secure" messaging apps they used to chat with family and friends, was a spying tool designed by the government of the United Arab Emirates. Americans ought to be alarmed by the news, but they also ought to be alarmed by something else: Our private data isn't actually private, either.
The New York Times obtained a cache of location information from 12 million phones that combine together for 50 billion geographic pings. Each phone user is captured by thousands of dots on a map that, when connected, reveal the most intimate details of his or her day-to-day life. Seemingly innocent apps, from jewel-swapping games to weather services, soak up our movements and sell them to brokers who in turn sell them to advertisers. The entire enterprise is completely legal.
That a massive market for location data exists isn't a revelation, but viewing so vast a collection of information in so concentrated a place still is revelatory. The Times was able to track Inau guration Day protesters, follow scientists at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, trace a Post journalist through Arlington, Virginia and even travel in President Donald Trump's digital footprints as he lounged at Mar-a-Lago and golfed at his club in Jupiter, Florida.
The data was safe in the Times's hands, but what about the hands of an enemy state seeking to blackmail an intelligence operative, or an abusive husband trying to find his fleeing wife? And what about the idea of ambient privacy - our ability to move through the world without the knowledge that someone, somewhere, is always watching?
Many have used the Times report to call for the regulation of location data, which, as the paper's analysis makes manifest, can never be truly anonymized. They're right to ask for that, but they should ask for more along with it: a comprehensive privacy framework that looks beyond a single category to restrict how companies collect, keep, process and share our personal information.
That framework should put an emphasis on what data companies reasonably need to gather (much less sell) to provide a service, rather than what data they'd like to collect to fill their coffers.
The Times's project and those that have come before it reveal that it doesn't take a plot by a repressive regime to get people to surrender to surveillance. It takes only pages on pages of opaque terms of service and a legal landscape free of restraints. Perhaps if members of Congress could see their own thousands of dots moving across a map, they would finish the work they started more than a year ago and produce the robust law the country deserves.

Texto completo: On Christmas day, Greta Gerwig's updated version of the young adult classic "Little Women" opened in theaters to great acclaim, fantastic reviews and strong box office numbers.
And yet, some women found fault with the fact that not enough men were flocking to see it.
In a piece for The New York Times, writer Kristy Eldredge observed that the film hadn't garnered a lot of award nominations from the Screen Actors Guild (zero) and the Golden Globes (two), and mentioned that the audiences seemed to be overwhelmingly filled with women. Film producer Amy Pascal agrees, arguing in Vanity Fair that many male awards-season voters are skipping Gerwig's adaptation because they think it's not for guys.
Eldredge seemed to blame men for not appreciating female-centric stories and framed it as some sort of character flaw that society needed to address: "If many men haven't wanted to give it a chance because they don't think it's meant for them, we still have a way to go in considering all kinds of narratives about women to be deserving of thoughtful attention."
It's not surprising that a story about the relationship between four Civil War-era sisters written over 150 years ago and with absolutely no battlefield scenes is not a favorite with the Xbox set.
While there has always been some cross-gender interest in young adult literature like "A Separate Peace" and "Catcher in the Rye," which have strong male characters, there is a universality of message in those books. In other words, Holden Caulfield's existential angst and the rough contours of Gene and Phinny's tragic friendship have resonance beyond their masculinity. You could imagine a female Holden, or an equally traumatic betrayal between two young women at an all-girls school.
But "Little Women" is really just a movie about females, and their dreams and aspirations and disappointments, and that's perfectly OK. In fact, it's sublime. The book and the movies adapted from it are some of the most touching examples of female bonding in literary and cinematic history. As a Bryn Mawr graduate - like Katharine Hepburn - I am partial to the 1933 film, but Gerwig's adaptation is exceptional and deserving of all the accolades it will earn, despite the naysayers.
But it is a bit ridiculous for women to be complaining that men are not interested in a book and movie called, for lord's sake, "Little WOMEN." This preoccupation with "gender parity" has become cult-like.
I know a bunch of boys around the age of 11 or 12 who love dinosaurs and Jedis. They also love Harry Potter, "The Lord of the Rings," R.L. Stine, and any number of things that girls the same age might also enjoy. These are clearly things that bridge a gender divide because they are not specifically "male" or "female."
But when I was growing up, there were toys you gave to boys and toys you gave to girls, and it was not considered a hate crime to insist that your daughter not be given a GI Joe doll or that your son put down the Barbie. It was OK to recognize that there were stereotypes for a reason, namely, that boys and girls had different interests.
I don't share the angst over a presumed lack of interest on the part of men about the destinies of Meg, Jo, Amy and Beth March.
Ironically, Louisa May Alcott herself wasn't thrilled with the idea of writing what she called a "girls' story."
She wrote in her diary: "I plod away, though I don't enjoy this sort of thing. Never liked girls or knew many, except my sisters; but our queer plays and experiences may prove interesting, though I doubt it."
If even the writer of this wonderful girls' story doesn't expect boys to like it, why in the world should we?

Texto completo: I just finished reading an article in The New York Times on the alarming number of small and mid-size town newspapers across the country that are folding these days, including testimonies from local residents lamenting their absence: "Our Community Does Not Know Itself'" (Dec. 21.)
And I'm thinkin' that rather than dwelling on the Press Herald's shortcomings (few and far between as they might be), Portlanders (myself included) should be thankful that it's here at all, hangin' in. Better short comings, I say, than long gone.

Maine can revive volunteer EMS
Hal Phillips' recent letter ("Maine should move away from volunteer EMS model" Dec. 22) struck me as interesting given my paternal grandfather coupled his St. Regis Paper first shift responsibilities with those he took on as the Bucksport Fire Chief.
While I agree Maine is uniquely challenged with an aging, geographically sparse population, I also have a hard time giving up on the community driven themes within my childhood. For example, just three days after Phillips' letter was published, I had my own issue. Doing some chainsaw work around the house, an ash tree snapped and knocked me out. If it weren't for Will Tierney and those of the Long Island Volunteer Fire and Rescue team, who found me at my property and transported me safely on the town boat to Maine Med, I wouldn't be here.
Yes, Colin Woodard's "People on the Front Lines" series on Maine's EMS is concerning. I harken back to what Eric Wellman said, "They [first responders] evaluate themselves and don't really want to work in a hospital or behind a desk, they want to be mobile and in an environment that's changing, same as people who are in the military and fire and police services."
Though hard for this Morse High School "Shipbuilder" to admit, even Brunswick High School sees the need and wants to fill the void and is training it's students to fill important jobs as certified nursing assistants and emergency medical technicians.
From Newfield to New Gloucester, Maine might see within itself the community it always was and could be again.

Trump's behavior surely is cause for dismissal
When I served as a lieutenant commander in the U.S. Navy, I learned that the Uniform Code of Military Justice includes an article that prohibits behavior unbecoming an officer and a gentleman, and calls for the dismissal from the service of those convicted.
Is there any doubt that, as commander in chief, Donald Trump has engaged in behavior that is unbecoming an officer and a gentleman?

True believers supported Nixon until the end
Back in the day, I remember the Nixon impeachment scenario, when people proclaimed his innocence and touted what a great guy he was. It was an argument against Nixon that I, at 23 years old, lost many times. People were too enamored of his perceived accomplishments to recognize any frailty.
In almost a dÃ©jÃ  vu moment, we are again facing an impeachment of a president considered by some to be above the law, not to be held accountable for infractions that he deems "minor." I remember Richard Nixon's demeanor and behavior. He did not earn the nickname "Tricky Dick" for being a party host and jokester. He was more Machiavelli and less humorist.
Trump's conduct and behavior make Nixon look saintly. His allegiance to Russia and Vladimir Putin is something far beyond Nixon's transgressions. It is as if Putin and company have powerful leverage over the most powerful leader in the world. Something is seriously rotten in the Trumpian "state" of Moscow.
Having witnessed the population's dismay at Nixon's impeachment and the aftermath, one wonders what will happen to the senators who stand ready to acquit Trump. Is their acquittal an acquiescence to Trump's behavior and a willingness to have five more years of Trump leading us down a dark rabbit hole?
Nixon, while similarly guilty of malfeasance, resigned. A Trump acquittal may mean it is time to buckle our seat belts and prepare to bow to King Donald. Personally, I am not a fan of bowing.

How will Collins vote on impeachment rules?
President Tump was impeached by the House on Dec. 18. To remove a president, two thirds of members of the Senate must vote for removal - highly unlikely in a Senate with 53 Republicans.
But before the trial can proceed, Senate members must vote on the rules which will govern the trial.
Based on impeachment history - President Clinton in the 20th century and President Johnson in the 19th century - the Senate majority leader negotiates the rules with leaders of Senate Republicans and Democrats. A majority of Senate members (51) must then approve these rules. Senate leader Mitch McConnell already stated he is not impartial - regardless of the impartiality oath he must take - and he does not intend to allow additional documents or witnesses to be introduced.
The evidence from the House impeachment hearings is one-sided because President Trump ordered members of his administration to disobey congressional subpoenas for witnesses and documents. Senate Democrats want to introduce administrative documents and witnesses not yet seen or heard. Even President Trump said he wants witnesses. How Senate members vote on these rules will determine whether or not there will be a full and fair trial. How will Sen. Collings vote on these rules?

Don't forget history on program aimed at curbing drug prices It prevented the U.S. from negotiating with drugmakers and from importing cheaper drugs.

Texto completo: This is a story about how far politicians will go to get a president re-elected. No digging up dirt in a foreign country required, just old-fashioned arm twisting, a few ethical lapses and a talent for drama in the nighttime.
It's also about how politicians might not have needed to cry crocodile tears over high prescription drug prices now if they hadn't been so recklessly partisan 16 years ago.
Forbes magazine called it "one of the most extraordinary events in congressional history." The New York Times called it "the largest expansion of the welfare state since the creation of Medicare in 1965."
All because President George W. Bush needed more senior votes to be re-elected in 2004.
The Republicans had a dandy idea: Give Medicare recipients prescription drug coverage for the first time.
The idea had been in the works for months, but the end was tawdry. This is how it went:
Speaker Dennis Hastert brought up the bill in the wee hours of the night, first turning off C-SPAN's cameras. (It passed the Senate, 55-45, with votes from Maine's Republican Sens. Susan Collins and Olympia Snowe.) Even though the Republicans controlled Congress, they didn't have the House votes for the bill.
Medicare was already in financial trouble. Fiscal hawks weren't sure this was a good idea.
After the usual 15-minute vote, it was losing 209 to 194, so Hastert kept the board open for hours so his team could twist arms; he impressed upon them the urgency of getting the bill passed. "We must forget about ideological absolutes," he said.
The Republicans twisted arms for hours, and when the final vote came at 5:52 a.m., the bill passed 216-215. (Maine's Democratic Reps. Tom Allen and Mike Michaud voted against it.)
It was one of the most expensive bills ever to come before Congress, but it had no funding source whatsoever.
The entire cost went straight to the deficit.
"We didn't have the votes to pay for it," Sen. Orrin Hatch said later.
The Republicans even kept the cost secret to get the bill passed. Medicare's chief actuary, Richard S. Foster, knew the bill would cost $534 billion over 10 years though congressional budget resolutions had capped the cost at $400 billion.
Foster's boss, Thomas A. Scully, told Foster he would fire him if he told Congress the truth.
The inspector general later threatened Scully with an ethics violation but he quit before the ink had dried on the bill. Majority Leader Tom DeLay was reprimanded for his arm-twisting.
Turns out this was a bill for the drug industry, not for seniors. More than 900 people signed up to lobby for it.
"The pharmaceutical lobbyists wrote the bill," Rep. Walter Jones, a North Carolina Republican, told "60 Minutes."
Here's the relevance for today's drug price debate, as politicians scurry to get into the act: The bill prevented the government from negotiating with drug companies and from importing cheaper drugs. Would drug prices be lower now if those provisions hadn't been included back then?
Seniors weren't impressed. Days after Bush signed the bill, a poll showed 47 percent opposing and 26 percent approving the changes. Some members of Congress of both parties said seniors might actually be worse off with the bill.
Mark Serafini wrote in the National Journal: "(T)he group that should have come out on top - America's seniors - was reeling at the prospect of limited help, while watching industry groups count their bounty."
Louisiana Republican Rep. Billy Tauzin, the bill's chief House architect, became a lobbyist for the drug industry afterward.
For five years, as president and CEO of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, he successfully fought Congressional efforts to lower drug prices.
Bush was re-elected.

It's time for a $15 per hour federal minimum wage

Texto completo: Opponents of minimum-wage laws have long argued that companies have only so much money and, if required to pay higher wages, they will employ fewer workers.
Now there is evidence that such concerns, never entirely sincere, are greatly overstated.
Over the past five years, a wave of increases in state and local minimum-wage standards has pushed the average effective minimum wage in the United States to the highest level on record. The average worker must be paid at least $11.80 an hour — more after inflation than the last peak, in the 1960s, according to an analysis by the economist Ernie Tedeschi.
And even as wages have marched upward, job growth remains strong. The unemployment rate at the end of 2019 will be lower than the previous year for the 10th straight year.
The interventions by some state and local governments, however, do not obviate the need for federal action. To the contrary. Millions of workers are being left behind because 21 states still use the federal standard, $7.25 an hour, which has not risen since 2009 — the longest period without an increase since the introduction of a federal standard in the 1930s.
Across much of America, the minimum wage is set to rise again in the next few days. In Maine and Colorado it will reach $12; in Washington, $13.50; in New York City, $15. Workers in the rest of the country also deserve a raise. The time has come to increase the federal minimum.
More than doubling the current federal standard would be a significant change, and it is not without risk. It is possible that a national $15 standard would produce the kinds of damage critics have long predicted; the Congressional Budget Office puts the potential increase in unemployment somewhere between zero and 3.7 million people, essentially acknowledging the effects are unpredictable.
But the successful increases in minimum-wage standards across a diverse range of states and cities suggest the broader risk is worth taking. The American economy is generating plenty of jobs; the problem is in the paychecks. The solution is a $15 federal minimum wage.

Texto completo: I've covered things that injure, sicken and kill kids and adults for more than 30 years. In late August, I added vaping-related lung illnesses to the beat. Last month, I added marijuana, psychosis and other mental illnesses.
A search on the news archive Nexis shows that the number of stories mentioning "vaping" and "lung illness" went from 953 in September to 584 in October, a nearly 40% drop.
The deaths and injuries from lung illnesses are declining, but they've hardly abated and are clearly a sign of a much larger problem with excessive marijuana use among young people.
On Tuesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said 2,561 people have been hospitalized with vaping-related lung illness and 55 have died. There has been an outcry to ban flavored electronic cigarettes and Congress voted to raise the age for all e-cigarette tobacco products to 21 last month.
What if the purported problem is something advocates have been trying to get mandated or legalized for years?
Former New York Times business reporter Alex Berenson says that the human cost of cannabis is too high — and that the press is too pro-pot. When his latest book, "Tell Your Children: The Truth about Marijuana, Mental Illness and Violence," came out last year, he knew marijuana proponents wouldn't like it.
Berenson has become an unlikely favorite of the conservative media and think tanks. He blames what he says is "a genuine misunderstanding of the strength of the science supporting the cannabis-psychosis link."
Last month, the National Institute on Drug Abuse reported new data showing that marijuana use by students from eighth to 12th grade was way up.

Living in the 'golden age of crosswords'

Texto completo: In 1924, the U.K.-based newspaper The Tamworth Herald warned of a dangerous craze that had "enslaved" the United States. | The newspaper described a "menace ... making devastating inroads on the working hours of every rank of society." People were "shamelessly" participating at all hours of the day. It was dealing "the final blow to the art of conversation." | The culprit? Crossword puzzles. | Yep, crossword puzzles, those grids of black-and-white blocks and often pun-ny clues that appear in the pages of newspapers. They were all the rage in the 1920s, until the nationwide fad eventually died along with the Charleston and pole-sitting.
Nearly a century later and we're in the "golden age of crosswords." Or so says Will Shortz. He should know: Shortz has been the editor of the storied New York Times crossword puzzle since 1993, and before that worked at Games magazine for 15 years. "They have never been as popular, with the possible exception of 1924," Shortz, who lives in Pleasantville, New York, told NorthJersey.com. "Now crosswords are more up to date, they're livelier, they feel more modern. I think they're attracting a wider audience than ever."
'A good kind of torture' Once upon a time, crossword fans had to rely on newspapers, magazines or published puzzle books to get their fix. Now you can solve them on your tablet or phone via apps (USA TODAY's crossword app was a big hit with its readers), or subscription-based sites like The Inkubator and Fireball Crosswords can send them to your inbox. You can sign up for Queer Crosswords or Women of Letters by donating to specific charities.
"Now there are so many other options and venues," said Anna Gundlach, a puzzle fan and crossword constructor who lives in Portland, Oregon. "A lot of the distribution channels are able to be bypassed entirely."
The proliferation of independent crossword puzzles means a wider range of clues and answers and more provocative content. Puzzle editors at the New York Times reject puzzles if they decide a clue or answer is too obscure. Gundlach said the paper passed on one of hers because it referenced Bell Biv DeVoe. "The American Values Club, which I've done a crossword for recently, has a more Gen X, millennial bent to it," she said. "Fresher clues, not afraid to swear or talk about sex."
Gundlach has had a nearly lifelong puzzle obsession. For Howard Barkin, a love of crosswords came late. He started solving them in his early 30s during lunch breaks to get his mind off work. Now he's 45 and a legit crossword puzzle champion. Barkin, who lives in Somerset County, finished first place in the 2016 American Crossword Puzzle Tournament in Stamford, Connecticut.
Shortz is the director for the contest, which pits the best crossword solvers against one another in seven games over the course of a weekend, culminating in a final round for the three finalists. Barkin's tournament victory came after solving the last puzzle in 7 minutes, 49 seconds. The stress level was high, Barkin said.
"Most people aren't used to solving a crossword with a timer counting down in a room full of 500 people," he said.
Barkin also constructs crosswords when he frees up time between doing dishes and raising two young daughters. He said his favorite to solve involve "extremely evil" tricks.
"A puzzle that breaks the rules, but for a good reason," he said. "A puzzle where you have to write a Greek letter into a square or something. It's a good kind of torture."
'Wow us' Even with a host of alternatives, the gold standard crossword remains the one The New York Times publishes. "It's capital T, capital C: The Crossword," Gundlach said. "When people talk about 'the Sunday crossword' or 'the Friday crossword,' that's generally assumed to be the New York Times crossword."
Crossword fans use the hashtag #NYTXW on Twitter to brag about their finish times and offer their often-harsh criticism of that day's puzzle. The Dec. 12 crossword elicited reviews like "Ugh. So Bible heavy and then that twist? No." and "Ok #NYTXW sorry I don't know the ATOMIC NUMBER of NEODYMIUM?!?!"
The newspaper's associate puzzles editor, Sam Ezersky, doesn't take that kind of criticism personally. His Facebook banner photo is a foul-mouthed pan of one of his crossword puzzles.
"It's an obsessive culture," Ezersky said. "I get being so passionate about something like this."
Ezersky grew up in a Washington, D.C., suburb as a puzzles fanatic and sold his first crossword puzzle to the Los Angeles Times when he was 16 years old. He's 24 now, lives in Hoboken and spends his days sifting through some of the roughly 600 crossword puzzle submissions the New York Times receives monthly (via snail mail only). Some he turns down with nothing more than a glance. Either the grid is an odd pattern, or the words are meh. "We're just looking for fresh things that really capture our attention," he said. "These days we really need the puzzles to wow us."
Ezersky does not construct puzzles as much as he used to, but he snagged a dream assignment this year, creating the annual "super mega" crossword that ran Dec. 15 in the New York Times' special puzzles section. It was a massive undertaking: a 50x50-square grid with 708 answers. It's so big the clues are printed on a separate page. Ezersky estimates it took hundreds of hours to construct. Still, he would have begged to do it if necessary.
"I know there were other constructors that declined because it's a such a Herculean task," he said. "If I could have been totally no filter and not cared about professionality, I would have been like, 'Please please please please please.'"
An Ezersky crossword from August shows how his mind works when he puzzles out a puzzle. He began with the across answer at the bottom left, where he placed "tech-savvy." He then stacked "heist film" right on top, giving himself the unenviable challenge of finding a down answer that ends with "lv." He did: "capital V."
Once the grid is done, he dreams up clues. He clued "tech-savvy" with "E-sharp?" — that question mark is crossword-ese indicating there's a joke or pun involved — and asked readers to get to "capital V" with the clue "Symbol for 54-down." The answer there was "volts." Constructing crossword puzzles can be agonizing, Ezersky said, but he wouldn't want any other job. "My mantra to myself is I'm just getting started," he said. "I'm just humbled and grateful to be doing what I'm doing."

Texto completo: First it was smoking; now health officials are all exorcised over vaping (Dec. 28, 2018). When are we going to face up to the worst health hazard that threatens our country, which is obesity?
Alas, even some of the worst offenders can even be the very doctors and nurses we rely on to give us good health advice. I guess it's all right to chastise smokers, but it's considered mean to suggest that one should cut down on their intake of food.
I remember when they started to outlaw cigarette ads; perhaps it's time to cut down on all the restaurant and fast food ads that glorify food as the end all of pleasure.
We all should take responsibility for our health and it starts with what we put into our mouths — whether it be a cigarette or food.
Susan Holmes, Rancho Mirage
Feb. 15: Be nicer, folks Re: "Demeaning decorum," Feb. 11 letter to the editor
Kudos to this letter writer! I am anything but a Trump supporter, being very critical of his "in your face" brand of leadership. However, as my mother told me at a young age, "Two wrongs don't make a right."
As a long-time Independent voter, I was more than disappointed in the actions by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi behind the president; just plain rude.
Before the State of the Union speech, which I was not planning to watch, there was no question as to my 2020 vote. As the earlier referenced letter alluded to, the Dems have the ability to snatch "defeat" from "victory." So, 2020 may come down to the least worse choice, à la 2016.
Joe Oaks, Palm Desert
Feb. 17: My 'new technology' idea It seems to me that city councils down here are easily buffaloed by every "Rube Goldberg" idea starting with a front-page story. If that fails to grab their interest, then you throw it to one of them hidden councils like CVAG.
I seen that "desert art" idea done by them young 'uns who never visit a museum and I'm excited to present my "new technology" idea, too: it starts with a Radio Flyer and I put a high-tech propeller on the front end.
You can self-propel it through the streets and sidewalks and you can leave it anywhere you want. Clean technology, no nasty regulations, no public interference and I can charge what I want and think "what an entrepreneur I am" all the same! More than that I can tell my parents I got a job! Besides that, I can build up enough cred to run for city council!
Pit O'Maley, Rancho Mirage
March 3: A history lesson Recently, President Trump tweeted that The New York Times was an "Enemy of People" of our great nation for daring to print articles critical of him, his administration, and its policies.
A little history here about the use of the phrase "Enemy of the People" by leaders.
It was used by Stalin, the Nazis, Mao, our own Joe McCarthy, and is currently used by the leaders of the Philippines, Turkey, China, Russia, Venezuela, North Korea and other despots who need to foster group think; vilify any individual, group or news organization that opposes their policies and direction; and justify their extreme positions to the masses.
However, history has shown in each of these cases it was not the groups being vilified that were the "enemy of the people" but rather the authoritarian leaders themselves.
I am certain history will find the real "enemy of the people" is the same in the current situation of Mr. Trump's use of the phase against The New York Times.

March 11: This seems out of place I was shopping on El Paseo and had to walk around construction to get to my next store. I saw this beautiful, contemporary structure being finished, LEAF.
I asked if it was a new restaurant and a young man softly said, "marijuana."
I'm amazed that this was approved by Palm Desert. It is in between upscale boutiques and, to me, totally out of place.
I'm wondering if an upscale liquor store will be next.
From experience I can tell you that marijuana does alter consciousness. Different people react differently and now they have so many choices. Wow.
Many of the younger people smoke in my family and I see it in their eyes and in their demeanor
Hurray for the capitalists who will turn this into a big money proposition and too bad for the people on the road, on their jobs, etc.
Again, I am shocked to see the new, beautiful LEAF.
Rita Firestone Seger, Palm Desert, Carmel
April 8: This isn't a plan U.S. Rep. James Comer, R-Kentucky, went on CNN. After being asked by Poppy Harlow what his constituents would think of him and Congress if he voted to abolish the ACA and removed Medicaid from 450,000 Kentuckians. His response was that then Congress would be forced to come together and craft "a solution."
Seriously? Is this how governance looks to Republicans? Throw a bomb in the medical system, blow up the economy, throw hundreds of thousands of human beings into a hell of their representative's own making, and then "hope" that the provenly dysfunctional Congress, under this "leadership," can suddenly correct all the chaos, heartbreak, and destruction that they caused without forethought, reasoned thinking, or even a real consensus among even their own side of the aisle.
Where's your plan, congressman? Where's any plan by the Republicans? They have had at least three years to come up with something but they have been so busy dodging serious questions about their own ethics in their blind support for President Donald Trump that they have accomplished absolutely nothing productive or "for the people."
In baseball, we say "Throw da bums out!"

May 3: Build the fence If Peninsular bighorn sheep are a growing danger for La Quinta residents by roaming the streets, golf courses at PGA West, and gated communities, of course a fence needs to be constructed AND the sheep must be required to pay for it.
Leo J. Jordan, Indio
June 13: Thanks for the break A splendid decision by The Desert Sun to opt out of national topics on Opinion pages for the month of July. Maybe it will catch on and become a permanent thing; I guess we can hope so, some of us.
I am frankly tired of all the political ranting and raving in the paper, and elsewhere, and we're almost a year and a half before the 2020 election! I guess we'll live through it all somehow, but thanks again for your compelling decision.
Bob Semes, Palm Springs
June 13: Vacation from national politics The Desert Sun Opinion section going on vacation from national politics is a disappointing idea from the editor.
On July 4th, Donald Trump will deliver a nationalistic speech to promote his isolationist, anti-immigrant agenda. Will The Desert Sun refrain from publishing any Opinion commentary — from readers or columnists — on this?
Local issues always deserve our attention, however, our democracy is at stake. Local readers' comments in letters to the editor regarding our national government, should never be muted by a newspaper that is going on "vacation."
Robert and Melinda Winet, Rancho Mirage
July 12: A 'curious' omission I am a full-time resident of Los Angeles and a lifelong visitor to Palm Springs.
It's very curious as to why the T&CC is not included in the proposed settlement agreement with Grit, which because of the timing should be included.
In addition to T&CC, another concern is the Downtown Development. Did the City ever conduct a third-party audit of the entire project? If any liability issues are discovered, should also be included in the global settlement.
Alan Merson, Woodland Hills
Aug. 7: Surf parks, conservation don't mix Rip out your grass.
Put in desert landscape.
"If it's yellow, let it mellow."
For what? So we can build a surf park using millions of gallons of water. What?!
Jim Trotter, Rancho Mirage
Sept. 8: Living with coyotes Re: "Palm Springs dog owners on high alert after coyote attack," Aug. 31 front-page story
Very informative article on the coyotes that live among us in the desert.
I live in the Twin Palms neighborhood and walk each morning with my Lab/Shepherd/Doberman mix. Coyotes are about the same size as my dog and when we come across them they typically give us a wide berth, but I never take that for granted.
The best thing pet owners can do is stay alert, keep your dog close. Perhaps ditch those retractable leashes that allow a dog to lag behind or rush ahead at their own pace.
This is the coyotes' eco-system. We are the interlopers. Hopefully we can continue to co-exist.
Eleni P. Austin, Palm Springs
Sept. 22: In or Out? Re: In-N-Out eatery controversy in Rancho Mirage
I am getting hungry and would like to place my order and it is "IN."
Barry Gowen, Rancho Mirage
Oct. 11: The newspaper, residents need each other The Desert Sun's Oct. 8 Opinion cartoon hits the nail squarely on the head: Artist Joe Heller quotes Luis A. Ferre, "A City Without a Newspaper Is A City Without a Soul."
From Coachella to Palm Springs, residents of the Coachella Valley have but one local newspaper — and, to our deep concern, that newspaper has had more than its share of distress, much like other newspapers around the country.
The newspaper meets economic crisis after crisis with reductions in its general coverage or staff cuts. I am speculating that the public responds to those cuts in quality with cancelled subscriptions. Which only compounds the paper's problems — and our difficulty to know what is going on in our individual and neighboring cities across the valley.
If this continues we will all lose. Nor do we dodge the bullet by turning to the Internet because it only provides the searcher with articles taken directly from, guess who? ... Yep, the newspaper.
There's no meaningful substitute for a vibrant local newspaper.
The solution? Helping the newspaper increase its circulation and encouraging local advertising. There is no other remedy for our local needs.
The Desert Sun needs us all. And we need it.
Dana Hobart, Rancho Mirage
Nov. 17: Not loving the arena plan The predicted new arena business is an exciting addition to the town. But the projected building ain't gonna be pretty.
The recent reveal of rendering and elevations on pages 11 through 16 in the Desert Sun downloadable study paper show the building for how it will look. It's a huge barn.
From north and east views, the structure looks industrial. From south and west views, it resembles a corporate office park spec building with plaza adjacent. The new museum and spa buildings in progress appear classy. Even the hulking new parking garage has some presence and grace. This giant box will not make any architect's career.
Clearly interior function is the focus. But it needs better exterior relation to the nearby projects.
Perhaps they could bring in a design consultant to put a little lipstick on exterior surfaces and shapes — as the city of Palm Springs required for the new downtown buildings facing Palm Canyon Drive. One can hope.
Finally, has anyone talked about its sustainability features? I cannot remember what's been said about that detail. This is a great opportunity to set a good example.
The Rev. Kevin A. Johnson, Palm Springs
Dec. 14: Can we unite again? I was the only liberal at a barbecue lately and did not offer any opinions.
After hearing several conservative comments, I stated that, whatever our politics, we can agree we all love our country. This comment was met with dead silence, as if I had committed the worst of faux pas.
Any suggestions out there of a way to reach across the divide?

Ex-gulag outpost survives against odds As the young flee, frigid Russian city relies on resilience

Texto completo: MAGADAN, Russia - Like many young people in Magadan, a frigid northern Russian city more than 3,600 miles from Moscow, Dinat Yur is fed up with living in a place where winters drag on for six months and the average annual temperature is below freezing.
"I really dream of leaving this place," said Yur, a 29-year-old cook. "I can't wait."
Born and raised in a city proud of its resilience against climatic and all other odds, Yur has for the moment found his calling in a defiantly contrarian occupation for a place so cold: He makes ice cream.
As the temperature in Magadan dipped the other week to well below freezing - on its way to -58 degrees Fahrenheit once winter really sets in - he was hard at work mixing milk, sugar and a raspberry mush imported from Italy to produce a summery swirl of frozen gelato.
Eating his confections outside during winter, Yur conceded, is not a good idea - they quickly turn to teeth-cracking chunks of ice - but "everyone here likes to sit at home in front of the TV with some ice cream."
Russia's curious love affair with ice cream has long been a subject of theorizing about how a country plagued by such terrible weather and other miserable conditions manages to keep going, prevailing over seemingly insurmountable hurdles.
Particularly popular in Russia is a story, probably apocryphal, about a visit to Moscow in the winter of 1944 by Winston Churchill that has Britain's wartime leader noticing Muscovites eating ice cream on a snowy street from his car window and declaring "such a people will never be conquered."
Moscow, however, has winters that usually hover in the 20s - meaning that Magadan is pushing the limits of this against-the-odds spirit.
Burdened by its Stalin-era beginnings as the gateway to a string of brutal labor camps in nearby Kolyma - where tens of thousands were executed and more than 100,000 died of disease and hunger - the city is trying to rebrand itself cheerily as the "golden heart of Russia," a reference to vast reserves of gold buried in nearby mountains.
Built on an icy bay overlooking the Sea of Okhotsk, north of Japan, Magadan is Russia's version of Dawson City, the Canadian town created by the Klondike Gold Rush at the end of the 19th century. Only Russians never rushed to Magadan; they were dragged there.
The only recent rush has been to the exit.
Young people particularly are making a run for it, a stampede that the city's mayor, Yuri Grishin, has worked to slow. He points to a new sports complex now under construction, a rash of restaurant openings and fresh licks of paint for buildings in the center of town as possible encouragement for people to stay put.
After years of dramatic decline that slashed the population by more than 40%, the mayor said the number of residents has now "more or less stabilized" at around 91,000.
But among those who have moved away are the mayor's own three grown children. One now lives in Moscow.
The mayor does not understand. Why would anyone trade Magadan for the capital, where "they will live in a tiny apartment and spend three hours a day in traffic jams," he asked.
Aside from its bleak weather and even bleaker history, Magadan is, if truth be told, no worse - and in some respects better - than many provincial Russian towns. It has the same crumbling concrete apartment blocks, the same colonnaded theater building, the same central square formerly named after Lenin and the same street slogans celebrating victory in the Great Patriotic War, as Russia refers to World War II.
It also has three movie houses, two indoor public swimming pools, a well-deserved reputation for camaraderie and a huge new Orthodox cathedral with glittering golden domes, an indispensable feature of urban planning in the age of President Vladimir Putin.
Another plus is climate change, which is making winters somewhat milder. It did not start snowing heavily this year until late November.
When the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, Magadan had 155,000 people. They were a mix of locally born residents - many of them descendants of former gulag prisoners, guards or administrators - and outsiders attracted by salaries that had for years been far higher than in the rest of the country. That was thanks to the "northern bonus," a Soviet-era premium offered to anyone willing to work there.
But for many people in Magadan, the end of the Soviet Union meant economic ruin. The slashing of Soviet-era subsidies sent Magadan salaries tumbling. As factories closed and services withered, some free-market zealots in Moscow suggested that the city be put out of its misery and shut down.
Putin, though, has done the opposite, stressing the importance of keeping remote northern outposts alive, no matter the cost. His calculations include security, patriotic pride in Russia's reach, and economics: Most of Russia's natural resources lie beneath the ice and snow of places like Magadan and the nearby wilds.
While Magadan is blessed with rich supplies of gold, silver and other natural resources, conditions are so harsh that some economists still question whether it makes sense to keep it as a city rather than just a transit center for contract workers heading for the mines.
But giving up on Magadan as a functioning urban center would effectively return it to its original role when it was founded in 1929 - a grim seaport through which geologists and then gulag laborers passed on their way to the gold mines of Kolyma. Alexander Solzhenitsyn, the author of "The Gulag Archipelago," described this particular outpost of the gulag as "the pole of cold and cruelty."
When Solzhenitsyn returned to Russia in 1994 after years of exile in Vermont, he made Magadan his first stop, explaining upon his arrival from Alaska that he had "come to bow to the land where many hundreds of thousands of our countrymen, who were executed, are buried."
Because of the flight of young people, Magadan now has a severe shortage of able-bodied workers. The mayor said the city needed 20,000 more people to do construction and other work and is making do in the meantime by bringing in workers on short-term contracts.
"It upsets me that people have this stereotype of Magadan as a big prison camp," the mayor said. The city, he added, is "repositioning itself as a bright, colorful and happy place."

Texto completo: Opponents of minimum-wage laws have long argued that companies have only so much money and, if required to pay higher wages, they will employ fewer workers.
Now there is evidence that such concerns, never entirely sincere, are greatly overstated.
Over the past five years, a wave of increases in state and local minimum-wage standards has pushed the average effective minimum wage in the United States to the highest level on record.
The average worker must be paid at least $11.80 an hour — more after inflation than the last peak, in the 1960s, according to an analysis by the economist Ernie Tedeschi.
And even as wages have marched upward, job growth remains strong. The unemployment rate at the end of 2019 will be lower than the previous year for the 10th straight year.
The interventions by some state and local governments, however, do not obviate the need for federal action. To the contrary. Millions of workers are being left behind because 21 states still use the federal standard, $7.25 an hour, which has not risen since 2009 — the longest period without an increase since the introduction of a federal standard in the 1930s.
Across much of America, the minimum wage is set to rise again in the next few days. In Maine and Colorado it will reach $12; in Washington, $13.50; in New York City, $15. Workers in the rest of the country also deserve a raise. The time has come to increase the federal minimum.
House Democrats passed legislation in July that would gradually increase the federal standard, to $15 an hour in 2025 — likely raising the real value above the peak value in the late 1960s — and most of the Democrats running for president have endorsed the legislation. Last year, only about 430,000 people — or 0.5 percent of hourly workers — were paid the federal minimum. The share has fallen in recent years as state and local governments, and some employers, have stepped in. But a much larger group of workers stand to benefit, because they now earn less than the proposed minimum. The Congressional Budget Office estimated a $15 minimum hourly wage would raise the pay of at least 17 million workers.
More than doubling the current federal standard would be a significant change, and it is not without risk. It is possible that a national $15 standard would produce the kinds of damage critics have long predicted; the Congressional Budget Office puts the potential increase in unemployment somewhere between zero and 3.7 million people, essentially acknowledging the effects are unpredictable.
But the successful increases in minimum-wage standards across a diverse range of states and cities suggest the broader risk is worth taking. The American economy is generating plenty of jobs; the problem is in the paychecks. The solution is a $15 federal minimum wage.

Texto completo: Kimberly Drew credits her family with exposing her to area museums and planting the seed of what has blossomed into a busy career blogging, posting, writing about and drawing attention to African-American artists and their works.
But as a child growing up in Orange, she was drawn to the exhibits as much for what she didn't find there as what she did. "Growing up in proximity to Newark and New York, I'm no stranger to cacophony," she says. "I liked the silence, and being in a calm, soothing environment."
Now 29 and living in Brooklyn, Drew is making a lot of noise in the art world herself. She recently published an essay for Playboy on provocative artist Marilyn Minter and a fashion-focused Vanity Fair cover story on actress Lupita Nyong'o; a forthcoming collaboration with New York Times writer Jenna Wortham on black creativity is slated for publication in 2020.
Sometimes Drew is the art herself: That's her on a billboard outside the Galeries Lafayette flagship store in Paris, promoting its "Fashioning Change" campaign. In August, Reebok announced that she was one of five women asked to work together on a shoe design that reflects her "bold personality."
Through it all, she has never forgotten her roots in Orange; in fact, she shows them off proudly by way of a certain tattoo. She spoke to Millburn & Short Hills Magazine about her work highlighting culture at locations here and abroad, including the White House lawn.
Did you think from an early age that you would be working in the art world?
I didn't understand experiencing art as a life path until I went to [Smith] college. It wasn't until I interned at the Studio Museum in Harlem, where I went from being a visitor to a potential applicant, that I understood that working in the arts was a possibility.
What did you gain from your internship at the Studio Museum?
I figured out so many things about who and how I wanted to be. It's not often that young black kids are taught they can work in museums. It's imperative that more curricula teach art-making and working in creative fields as a professional path. I was part of the millennial era, when we had arts programming in school and it was supported well. Now there are less resources [devoted to it]. Math is seen as something you use later in life, but art doesn't get treated the same way.
While still in college, you launched Black Contemporary Art on Tumblr. What was your goal, and how has the blog changed?
I had been so invigorated to learn about artists like Glenn Ligon and Trenton Doyle Hancock, and I wanted to build on that knowledge base. I enrolled in art history classes because I was hungry to learn more. The blog was an educational tool for myself. I made it a collaborative effort; I put out a call to other people on the Tumblr page to see if anyone was like-minded and wanted to work on it together. It's always been not just one unique person; three to five people contribute to it, and it's edited by committee.
The thing that's changed the most is that the lives of everyone who's worked on it have changed. I was a student, and I felt there were more hours in the day then. I check in when I can, but it's not as frequent as it was at one point, updating it every two hours around the clock. Now it exists as an archive.
How did you come to be hired as the Associate Online Community Producer at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and what innovations did you add while there?
By the time I applied, I had been working in social media for about five years, and had a good deal of experience in a new medium. I'd also had some success in other communities I managed, including [the nonprofit] Creative Time and the Lehmann Maupin art gallery. In my time at the Met, our online audience grew by over 5 million users across platforms. I also initiated our We Chat Chinese social network; it wasn't successful, but it pushed me to step out of my comfort zone. It spoke to the tourist population at the institution to serve them more thoughtfully.
My predecessor launched Facebook Live, and I expanded on our outreach to Korean, American Sign Language, Spanish and other speakers. Our strategy was always to invite people in whether they could come physically or not. It's such a great tool for gallery tours; people can experience them from the comfort of their own homes.
What was it like taking over the White House Instagram account for a day in 2016?
The Obama White House was looking for someone to handle Instagram during their South by South Lawn event, and I'd worked as a social media manager, so there was a level of trust already. They were familiar with my work and thought I would be a great voice for the project. I did on-the-ground interviews and shared my experience of the event. Common was there, and so was Jillian Mercado, the model and activist. It was great because I had gone to visit the White House with my family, and being able to go back for this very specific occasion was great.
You and Jenna Wortham are collaborating on a book celebrating the works of black artists. That's a big subject. How will you cover it?
The book is about what it means to be black and alive right now. It'll be a mix of photos and text that takes a screen shot of what's going on right now. Social media has created so many opportunities for connections; in a black context, how do we archive what's going on? Black Lives Matter started as a Facebook post. How do we build an archive around how that movement began?
How has living in Brooklyn shaped your participation in the art community?
I go to so many things in Brooklyn, for sure. The Brooklyn Museum has great public programming, the BRIC arts center is free and open to the public, I saw a play at the Shakespeare Center... I write about artists in the Brooklyn community.
You've been writing about artists for a lot of national magazines lately. Do you enjoy the interview process?
I love to do interviews, in writing and in person. I like inviting audiences to dialogue; it's my favorite way to interact. I also love to go to talks, and I want to make the best talks possible. We've all been to a bad talk.
I understand that you have a 973 tattoo on the inside of your ankle. When did you get it, and what does it mean to you?
I got it as soon as I turned 18; it was one of the first tattoos I got. I have so much Jersey pride. Ride or die for 973.

The West is in peril

Texto completo: If Western elites were asked to name the greatest crisis facing mankind, climate change would win in a walk.
Thus did Time magazine pass over every world leader to name a Swedish teenage climate activist, Greta Thunberg, its person of the year.
On New Year's Day, the headline over yet another story in The Washington Post admonished us anew: "A Lost Decade for Climate Action: We Can't Afford A Repeat, Scientists Warn."
"By the final year of the decade," said the Post, "the planet had surpassed its 2010 temperature record five times. "Hurricanes devastated New Jersey and Puerto Rico, and floods damaged the Midwest and Bangladesh. Southern Africa was gripped by a deadly drought. Australia and the Amazon are ablaze."
On it went, echoing the endless reports on the perils of climate change to the planet we all inhabit.
Yet, from the inaction of the carbon-emitting countries like India, China, Russia and the U.S., the gravity with which Western elites view the crisis is not shared by the peoples for whom they profess to speak. For many First World countries, there are more compelling concerns. High among them is population decline, and, if birth rates do not rise, the near-extinction of many Western peoples by this century's end.
The number of births in Japan fell in 2019 to a level unseen since 1874, around 900,000. But there were 1.4 million deaths for a net loss of 512,000 Japanese. An even larger loss in Japan's population is expected this year. Japan's population has been shrinking since 2007, when deaths first exceeded births by 18,000. And with 28% of its population over 65, and fewer births every passing year, Japan is aging, shrinking and dying — with no respite in sight.
Across Japan, writes The New York Times: "Whole villages are vanishing as young people choose not to have children or move to urban areas ... The Government estimates that the population could shrink by about 16 million people -- or nearly 13 percent -- over the next 25 years."
South Korea has an even lower birth rate, and its population is expected to start diminishing this year.
But it is Eastern Europe where the population crisis is most advanced. At the end of the Cold War, Bulgaria had 9 million people. By 2017, that had fallen to 7.1 million. In 2050, Bulgaria's population is estimated at 5.4 million — a loss of 40% to death and migration since Bulgaria won its freedom from the Soviet Empire.
By 2050, Ukraine and Poland are each projected to lose another 6 million people, and Hungary will lose 1.5 million.
Lithuania and Latvia have seen serious population losses since the end of the Cold War and are in the front rank of European nations losing people at the fastest rate. U.N. demographers project Russia's population may fall from 145 million today to 121 million by 2050. Such losses rival those that Russia suffered under Lenin, Stalin and World War II.
The Far East is home to some 6 million Russians who dwell on that vast tract that is so full of natural resources like timber, oil and gas. "The population continues to decrease almost everywhere in the Far East," lamented President Vladimir Putin at an investment conference in Vladivostok: "The inflow is increasing, but it does not cover the number of people leaving the region." In the Far East, Siberia and the Lake Baikal region, investors and workers from China are appearing in growing numbers.
The tribes of Europe, the peoples of almost every country of the Old Continent, are visibly aging, shrinking and dying. The population crisis of Europe is "existential," says Croatian Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic.
Since I published "The Death of the West," nothing has happened to alter my conclusion as to where the West was destined:
"The Death of the West" is not a prediction of what is going to happen. It is a depiction of what is happening now. First World nations are dying. They face a mortal crisis, not because of something happening in the Third World, but because of what is not happening at home and in the homes of the First World. Western fertility rates have been falling for decades. Outside of Muslim Albania, no European nation is producing enough babies to replace its population. ... In a score of countries the old are already dying off faster than the young are being born. ... There is no sign of a turnaround. Now the absolute numbers of Europeans have begun to fall."
We are talking here about what historians, a century hence, will call the Lost Tribes of Europe. And if a people has ceased to replace itself, and the national family is dying out, it is difficult to generate alarm over the slow sinking of the Maldives into the sea, the melting of the polar ice caps, or the fact that Greenland is getting greener every year.

Texto completo: We all learned as kids that "you can't judge a book by its cover," but that rule doesn't apply when Rick Wilson writes about political campaigns.
Wilson, 56, lives in Tallahassee and is a nationally known campaign consultant, writing a column for The Daily Beast and appearing often in political panel discussions. For the past 30 years, he's been a strategist and advertising pitchman for Republican candidates, crafting images and messages that usually left Democrats weeping into their mocha java grande lattes.
His first book, "Everything Trump Touches Dies," topped the New York Times best-seller list last year. His new one, "Running Against the Devil," is coming out Jan. 14, subtitled "a plot to save America from Trump — and Democrats from themselves."
His book covers pretty much tell readers what's inside. The new one features a shadowy profile of Trump with red horns and a spade tail. But this isn't just an all-out hate fest.
"As I've said before, Trump isn't Hitler. Hitler had normal-sized hands and the ability to concentrate for more than 30 seconds," Wilson concedes. But assessing what re-electing Trump portends for "our national soul," he warns that "a generation will learn its behavior from the worst role model since Saddam Hussein."
C'mon, Rick, don't soft-pedal it.
Wilson is probably the funniest man in politics, a trade not known for madcap funsters. There's almost a whiff of guilt about giving his high-priced political advice to his lifelong opponents. But Wilson believes that what's good for the country — that is, defeating Trump — means going against his conservative principles.
"If Democrats win, I'm going to hate it rather a lot," he writes in an early chapter. "But there's more at stake than political and ideological preference now."
Liberal Democrats won't welcome views of an apostate Republican. But to beat Trump, they need to reach millions of voters who don't trust the government to regulate guns, dislike abortion and want an orderly immigration policy.
Democrats can't attract those voters by calling their beliefs "hate."
Tactically, Wilson calculates that 15 states matter next year. Florida, with 29 electoral votes, is the biggest of them, followed by Pennsylvania (20), Ohio (18), Georgia and Michigan (16 each) and North Carolina (15). Trump won them in 2016 and, if Hillary Clinton had carried Florida and just one of the others ....
Well, she didn't. And Wilson warns Democrats not to get misty-eyed over what might have been. He sternly suggests any campaign worker who talks about the popular vote, rather than the Electoral College, should be confined in the faculty lounge at Oberlin until Nov. 4.
Issues? You want issues? Wilson says Trump is the issue, and the Democrat message has to be "he lied to you." Daydreaming about free college, gun control and Medicaid for all is cool in New York and the West Coast — states the Democrats couldn't lose anyway — but Midwest farmers and Pennsylvania steel workers need to be shown the man they trusted three years ago hasn't delivered.
Lacking a "generational candidate" like Bill Clinton or Barack Obama, Wilson says the Democrats need a good ol' bare-knuckle brawler who hits back at Trump's Tweets and the raw rhetoric of his rallies.
"Like juggling, it's hard," Wilson says of combating someone as unprecedented as the president. "Like juggling chain saws with a live ferret in your pants, it's also dangerous. (You practice first with a dead ferret in your pants. Don't ask.) (parentheses his)
Aside from Trump, Wilson cautions Democrats that they're up against Fox News, sophisticated Russian agitprop, a GOP solidly united out of love or fear of their man, Twitter-Facebook imagery and, of course, tons of money. Plus, the White House can control the daily news with not one, but two, jumbo jets to run around the world on "official" business.
Difficult though it may be for Democratic activists to understand, millions of Americans really enjoy laughing at them. Trump has persuaded his followers that not only is he telling the truth (wind turbines cause cancer; Mexico pays for the wall) but that those who impeached him are liars.
"Democrats are running against a party and a constituency who not only view the president's loose relationship with the truth as tolerable," Wilson writes, "but who see any lie or conspiracy theory that accomplishes their beloved goal of owning the libs as acceptable and, in fact, desirable."

Texto completo: The school has heeded the advice from the diversity committee about how to increase students of color in its ranks, Ash said. Now, young people of color who visit the ballet will see something other than a troupe largely of white dancers.
In early December, CBS News flew Aesha Ash from her California home to New York City.
There, Ash, a Rochester native now retired from an esteemed ballet career, met 11-year-old Charlotte Nebres — the first black girl cast by the New York City Ballet to play the role of Marie, the heroine in the holiday favorite, "The Nutcracker."
For Ash, the moment was monumental. When she was a young adult with the New York City Ballet, she was the lone black woman, and she often felt like an outsider. Now, she said in a telephone interview days after returning from New York, the New York City Ballet is truly embracing diversity, and Charlotte is living proof.
So much so that, Ash acknowledged, their meeting was not an emotional one. Ash imagines that, when she was with the ballet in the late 1990s and early 2000s, she would have been excited and nervous to meet a black woman who had also been on the same stages in a different era.
"The fact that she was, 'Eh, OK' (about the meeting) is a little testimonial that we've come a long way," Ash said.
The Swan Dreams Project Ash, 41, is the creator of the Swan Dreams Project, which started with her in full ballerina attire being photographed in struggling low-income communities — a reminder of the transformative power and beauty of art and dance. The project, now about 8 years old, has since grown, and for the past two summers, Ash has held weeklong camps in Rochester where children — most of them African American or Latino — can learn ballet, etiquette and nutrition.
The camp ends with a ballet performance by the students, and some have received scholarships to continue their dance training at Odasz Dance Theatre in Irondequoit. Some of the children occasionally write and send photos to Ash, making her wish she could see them and teach them regularly.
"It was almost like a mother abandoning her children," said Ash, a mother of two. "It hit me hard."
Now Ash is envisioning a larger Swan Dreams effort, and one she would like to begin in Rochester. With this project — which she admits is now a vision without funding — Swan Dreams would provide an after-school program in a city neighborhood, still highlighting the arts but also providing homework assistance and counseling.
While at the summer camps, she said, there were children who would tell her of difficulties and trauma in their lives, and she longed to find ways to help. The children "would share some things that were definitely over my head," Ash said.
"My dream is to even make the suburbs jealous and make them think, 'Gee, look at that great thing they have,'" she said of her plan.
Growing ballet diversity As a teenager, Ash left Rochester to attend the School of American Ballet, which typically feeds its students into the New York City Ballet. At the time, she often felt isolated, even when it came to performance preparation, when there was a makeup palette for the white dancers — but not for her skin tone — and her teachers often seemed unsure how she should style her hair.
Ash is now a member of the School of American Ballet's diversity committee, and much has changed since she was a student there.
"City Ballet, which takes most of its members from the School of American Ballet, its affiliate, is also showing signs of change," The New York Times wrote this month in an article about Charlotte Nebres. "Over the past seven years, 62 S.A.B. students have become City Ballet apprentices; of those, 21 identify as nonwhite or mixed; and of those, 12 refer to themselves as black; four of those are women. That carries weight: Since the 1970s, City Ballet has largely had only one black female dancer at a given time."
The diversity committee started in 2015, with Ash as one of its original members. All of the members are school alumni who have danced professionally.
While the School of American Ballet has stressed inclusiveness, its leaders have learned from the committee's members, including Ash, how there could be more improvements and a more welcoming environment, Carrie Hinrichs, the school's executive director, said in a telephone interview.
"It's not always been easy to hear where we haven't been as inclusive and supportive as we aspire to be, but certainly listening openly to this group of people has been a pivotal step to getting us to where we are now," she said.
"We now have a manager of diversity and inclusion on staff here," she said. "All of our faculty and staff are just in a much different place of learning to make it more inclusive."
The school has heeded the advice from the diversity committee about how to increase students of color in its ranks, Ash said. Now,young people of color who visit the ballet will see something other than a troupe largely of white dancers.
"It's comforting," Ash said. "It's something that we all need."
She said she's especially excited for those youngsters who will see Charlotte Nebres — who, by the way, is keeping her hair natural on stage — and think that one day they, too, could be on the same stage.
"There's this sense of joy I have for all that will get to see her," Ash said.

Texto completo: As we embark on the new decade, most of us have undoubtedly set some resolutions. Lose weight. Read more. Save for retirement. Quit smoking. Volunteer in the community.
Yet the vast majority of resolutions are anything but resolute. According to U.S. News & World Report, over 80% of resolutions fail (most within the first 30 days).
There are many reasons for our dismal results. We set targets that are unattainable; we get discouraged after a single slip and then quit altogether, or we lose track of the goal as daily life creeps into the picture. Yet researchers site the biggest pitfall as the lack of accountability.
The traditional way to establish accountability is through another person. If you agree to meet your buddy at the gym at 6 a.m., you're much more likely to show up than if no one was waiting. But some of our deepest life goals are too personal to share with others. Wouldn't it be great if we could hold ourselves accountable?
I recently learned of a free website called FutureMe.Org. It allows you to send an email to your future self. Simply type your future self a note and then select the delivery date.
Maybe you want to cheer your one-week-from-now self on for avoiding your favorite cookies. Why not schedule an email of your New Year's resolutions to be delivered at the beginning of each month? Or it could be a note to your 20-year-from-now self, reminding you to focus on your calling.
Besides the nostalgic fun of receiving a note from your past self, this simple mechanism can help boost your accountability, and performance. Simply knowing that the note is scheduled to arrive, you'll be less likely to let yourself down. In other words, the easy act of sending a note to yourself can be just the accountability hack you need to stay on target.
Thinking about your way-into-the-future self may also help you prioritize what really matters. The indulgences of today are far less appealing thinking about how you'll be feeling the day you open up an email from your 30-years-ago self. You don't need a time machine to connect with your future self, and shape how your life will unfold.
What message do you have for your one-month-from-now self? What about the five-year-from-now version? Whether you share thoughts on health, work, family, or politics, having a direct line of communication to the you-of-the-future can inspire positive results today.
As you embrace the new decade, let your future self guide both your important decisions and daily habits. The perspective of the future can help you make the best choices here and now.
Your future you will be proud.

Surprisingly good news about American family life — for kids

Texto completo: If your only sense of the state of our unions is drawn from the pop culture and the prestige press, you probably think marriage in America is on the ropes. The critically-acclaimed new movie, "Marriage Story," described by its costar Adam Driver as a "love story about divorce," provides viewers with an intimate and often raw glimpse into the demise of a marriage in New York City and Hollywood. The bestselling new novel from Taffy Brodesser-Akner, "Fleishman Is in Trouble," tells a similarly bleak marriage story about another bitter divorce unfolding in New York City between a doctor and a talent agent.
Pop cultural offerings like these give the impression that many marriages are messy and miserable, and the descent into divorce is rampant nowadays.
Or take the messages about marriage we get from the media. The New York Times recently ran an op-ed, "Beyond Marriage," from an eminent family scholar suggesting that marriage is "disappearing." Elsewhere, Brookings Institution fellow Isabel Sawhill warns, "marriage is in trouble and, however desirable, will be difficult to restore."
But the story of the death of marriage, told in popular and elite venues, has been greatly exaggerated, to paraphrase Mark Twain. While movies like "Marriage Story" and Times op-eds do their part to perpetuate the cultural myths of widespread divorce and the collapse of the institution of marriage, the reality is that there is good news to report about the state of our unions and state of the American family. If we look at three key trends over the last decade in the United States, there are bright spots on the family horizon.
1. Divorce is on the rocks First, divorce is down. In fact, the divorce rate has been falling since it peaked around 1980, at the height of the divorce revolution. According to our analysis, shown in the graph below, the divorce rate has fallen by nearly 25% over the last decade to the point where there are about 15 divorces per 1,000 married people today — about the same rate as in 1970. And scholars predict that the divorce rate will continue to fall.
Surveys tell us that Americans are less tolerant of divorce today. That's in large part because, as family scholar Richard Reeves put it, "Modern marriage is not principally about money, sex, or status. It's about children." Today's married couples seem to invest more in staying together, unlike the Boomers who were obsessed with their own fulfillment in the '70s,offering their children a better shot a more stable family life and future.
2. Children following marriage Second, nonmarital childbearing is down. As Lyman Stone explained at the Institute for Family Studies, though the reasons for the decline are complex, "we are actually approaching a decade of falling births to unmarried women."
Since 2009, the rate of nonmarital childbearing has fallen from 41.% to 39.6% in 2018. We think what's happened, in part, is that young adults in America have become more cautious in the wake of the Great Recession about forming families and, hence, are less likely to leap into parenthood without a ring on their finger.
3. Two-parent households And, finally, the share of children being raised in intact, married families is ticking upwards. Although family instability and single parenthood are still too high, less divorce and fewer babies born out of wedlock means more stable, married families in America. Since bottoming out in 2014, we've seen a small increase in the share of children being raised by their own married parents. Specifically, the share of children being raised in intact, married families bottomed out at 61.8% in 2014 and has now risen to 62.6% in 2019, according to our analysis of Census data. We expect this number to keep heading upwards in the coming years.
What does all this mean for American children? Children raised by their married parents enjoy a host of life-long benefits compared to children born into other family forms, including more financial stability, greater physical safety, more involved fathers, and greater educational, social and psychological outcomes.
And, as we have seen, those who are privileged to be born into married-parent families today are also less likely than children in the past few decades to witness their parents' divorce, sparing more children the grief that often follows from the death of their parents' marriage.
All of this is good news for our children, good news that has been obscured in recent pop cultural and media depictions of marriage in America. It should encourage us to do a better job of promoting the facts about the benefits of marriage to the rising generation, even as we try to help them form stronger marital bonds.
Although the State of Our Unions isn't as strong as it could be, for our kids at least, marriage is getting stronger — and this is news that should be widely heralded as we head into the new decade, especially given that the science tells us that intact marriage is the gold standard when it comes to the welfare of our kids.

Ex-gulag outpost survives against odds As the young flee, frigid Russian city relies on resilience

Texto completo: MAGADAN, Russia - Like many young people in Magadan, a frigid northern Russian city more than 3,600 miles from Moscow, Dinat Yur is fed up with living in a place where winters drag on for six months and the average annual temperature is below freezing.
"I really dream of leaving this place," said Yur, a 29-year-old cook. "I can't wait."
Born and raised in a city proud of its resilience against climatic and all other odds, Yur has for the moment found his calling in a defiantly contrarian occupation for a place so cold: He makes ice cream.
As the temperature in Magadan dipped the other week to well below freezing - on its way to -58 degrees Fahrenheit once winter really sets in - he was hard at work mixing milk, sugar and a raspberry mush imported from Italy to produce a summery swirl of frozen gelato.
Eating his confections outside during winter, Yur conceded, is not a good idea - they quickly turn to teeth-cracking chunks of ice - but "everyone here likes to sit at home in front of the TV with some ice cream."
Russia's curious love affair with ice cream has long been a subject of theorizing about how a country plagued by such terrible weather and other miserable conditions manages to keep going, prevailing over seemingly insurmountable hurdles.
Particularly popular in Russia is a story, probably apocryphal, about a visit to Moscow in the winter of 1944 by Winston Churchill that has Britain's wartime leader noticing Muscovites eating ice cream on a snowy street from his car window and declaring "such a people will never be conquered."
Moscow, however, has winters that usually hover in the 20s - meaning that Magadan is pushing the limits of this against-the-odds spirit.
Burdened by its Stalin-era beginnings as the gateway to a string of brutal labor camps in nearby Kolyma - where tens of thousands were executed and more than 100,000 died of disease and hunger - the city is trying to rebrand itself cheerily as the "golden heart of Russia," a reference to vast reserves of gold buried in nearby mountains.
Built on an icy bay overlooking the Sea of Okhotsk, north of Japan, Magadan is Russia's version of Dawson City, the Canadian town created by the Klondike Gold Rush at the end of the 19th century. Only Russians never rushed to Magadan; they were dragged there.
The only recent rush has been to the exit.
Young people particularly are making a run for it, a stampede that the city's mayor, Yuri Grishin, has worked to slow. He points to a new sports complex now under construction, a rash of restaurant openings and fresh licks of paint for buildings in the center of town as possible encouragement for people to stay put.
After years of dramatic decline that slashed the population by more than 40%, the mayor said the number of residents has now "more or less stabilized" at around 91,000.
But among those who have moved away are the mayor's own three grown children. One now lives in Moscow.
The mayor does not understand. Why would anyone trade Magadan for the capital, where "they will live in a tiny apartment and spend three hours a day in traffic jams," he asked.
Aside from its bleak weather and even bleaker history, Magadan is, if truth be told, no worse - and in some respects better - than many provincial Russian towns. It has the same crumbling concrete apartment blocks, the same colonnaded theater building, the same central square formerly named after Lenin and the same street slogans celebrating victory in the Great Patriotic War, as Russia refers to World War II.
It also has three movie houses, two indoor public swimming pools, a well-deserved reputation for camaraderie and a huge new Orthodox cathedral with glittering golden domes, an indispensable feature of urban planning in the age of President Vladimir Putin.
Another plus is climate change, which is making winters somewhat milder. It did not start snowing heavily this year until late November.
When the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, Magadan had 155,000 people. They were a mix of locally born residents - many of them descendants of former gulag prisoners, guards or administrators - and outsiders attracted by salaries that had for years been far higher than in the rest of the country. That was thanks to the "northern bonus," a Soviet-era premium offered to anyone willing to work there.
But for many people in Magadan, the end of the Soviet Union meant economic ruin. The slashing of Soviet-era subsidies sent Magadan salaries tumbling. As factories closed and services withered, some free-market zealots in Moscow suggested that the city be put out of its misery and shut down.
Putin, though, has done the opposite, stressing the importance of keeping remote northern outposts alive, no matter the cost. His calculations include security, patriotic pride in Russia's reach, and economics: Most of Russia's natural resources lie beneath the ice and snow of places like Magadan and the nearby wilds.
While Magadan is blessed with rich supplies of gold, silver and other natural resources, conditions are so harsh that some economists still question whether it makes sense to keep it as a city rather than just a transit center for contract workers heading for the mines.
But giving up on Magadan as a functioning urban center would effectively return it to its original role when it was founded in 1929 - a grim seaport through which geologists and then gulag laborers passed on their way to the gold mines of Kolyma. Alexander Solzhenitsyn, the author of "The Gulag Archipelago," described this particular outpost of the gulag as "the pole of cold and cruelty."
When Solzhenitsyn returned to Russia in 1994 after years of exile in Vermont, he made Magadan his first stop, explaining upon his arrival from Alaska that he had "come to bow to the land where many hundreds of thousands of our countrymen, who were executed, are buried."
Because of the flight of young people, Magadan now has a severe shortage of able-bodied workers. The mayor said the city needed 20,000 more people to do construction and other work and is making do in the meantime by bringing in workers on short-term contracts.
"It upsets me that people have this stereotype of Magadan as a big prison camp," the mayor said. The city, he added, is "repositioning itself as a bright, colorful and happy place."

Texto completo: New York's creative communities met Dec. 16 in Hell's Kitchen at the Baryshnikov Arts Center. There were writers and dancers, actors and musicians, from uptown and downtown, all drawn together by the memory of one woman: designer Isabel Toledo, who died in August of breast cancer.
She was as close to an artist as fashion had - even if she was best known for designing Michelle Obama's first inaugural parade dress and coat.
On a darkened stage illuminated by a white glow from a sewing machine and hanging ivory gown in one corner there came not only speeches (from journalist Wendy Goodman; Kim Hastreiter, the Paper magazine co-founder and curator; and writer Michaela Angela Davis, among others), but also performances.
The dancer Jillian Davis, of Complexions Contemporary Ballet, extended her limbs in elegy accompanied by a violin played by Ezinma (late of Beychella). Caridad de la Luz, the spoken word poet known as La Bruja, unscrolled a river of paper on which she had scrawled, in looping black pen, her paean. Basil Twist, the puppeteer, flew a marionette like a fluttering spirit. Joey Arias, the performance artist, belted out a love song.
Many of the speakers wore Toledo's designs.
And in the end, Whoopi Goldberg read a letter of skin and blood from Toledo's husband, artist and illustrator Ruben Toledo, to his wife.
The visceral emotion in the letter was reflective of the tenor of the event, because as much as the afternoon was an homage to Toledo and her work, the gathered throng was also there to acknowledge one of fashion's greatest love stories.
Ruben and Isabel Toledo were legend in an industry where individual ego and ambition often seem the norm and the relationships that are known tend to be fraught and soap-opera dramatic. Rarely, if ever, seen apart, the Toledos were each other's muses, with an almost symbiotic need to create.
They were beyond, said curator and retailer Katharina Sand, who met the Toledos when she was a very young journalist, "Yoko and John, Morticia and Gomez."
She realized "he was her missing link," Goodman said.
James Kaliardos, a makeup artist, talked about a dream he had in which he couldn't tell where Ruben stopped and Isabel began.
"He was the fabric, she was the needle, and they stitched it all together," said Aria.
Hastreiter, who knew the couple before they were married, said that Toledo had often painted his wife, and she had raised the possibility of doing an exhibition of his portraits. She guessed, Hastreiter recalled, that he probably had about 1,000. He corrected her.
"More like 10,000 Isabels," he said.
And as guests like Agnes Gund, the philanthropist, and Sandy Schreier, whose wardrobe has just gone on-show at the Met; Cuban American designer Narciso Rodriguez and Simon Doonan, the writer and former Barneys window dresser; Linda Fargo of Bergdorf Goodman and Ikram Goldman from Ikram in Chicago, lined up to hug Ruben Toledo, who had been hovering in the shadows, the image that lingered was the last still from the final film of the afternoon (because there was film, too). It was a moment caught as Ruben and Isabel were dancing - they loved to dance - arm in arm in the loft where they lived. Her dark hair was flying out behind her, and they were eye to eye, laughing.

Timothy Egan's remarkable tome lays out quest for faith book review

Texto completo: It's not hard to imagine dead silence on the other end of the line when Timothy Egan, the Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter and author, dialed up his literary agent and sketched out his proposal for a book-length perambulation through time and the tumultuous terrain of Western Christianity, a monthslong trek - by foot in the age of Uber! - from Canterbury to Rome, excavating tales of sinners and saints all along the way. Harder to imagine such a tome would prove impossible to put down.
Aha.
Mission Accomplished: "A Pilgrimage to Eternity" is, in fact, a glorious, laugh-out-loud, wipe-away-tears, blister-riddled, often rain-soaked, sometimes bone-chilled, desolate and desperate, quietly triumphant walk through church history - every last footfall in search of an elusive modern-day spiritual certitude.
Egan, an op-ed columnist for The New York Times, begins as a self-confessed skeptic, an Irish Catholic, who, like many, is "lapsed but listening." He lays out the stakes of his 1,000-mile quest for any flicker of faith: One member of his family, he writes, "was nearly destroyed by religion," another "made whole by religion," after the murder of her teenage son. Rage, he writes, is mixed with redemption.
"Malnutrition of the soul is a plague of modern life," Egan writes. His is a narrative driven by questions, and one that confronts doubt head-on, never reaching for facile conclusions.
Propelled by truth-seeking, he takes to the Via Francigena, one of the oldest pilgrimage trails in the world that for centuries has led the devout and seekers alike toward Rome, coursing Alpine peaks and medieval monasteries tucked into the folds of storybook hamlets across France, Switzerland and Italy.
Egan populates his trek with a quirky cast of fellow pilgrims, all of whom animate the adventure. He twists and turns from church history - never flinching from the good, the bad or the gruesome - into the deeply personal questions and quandaries that push him onward. His sister-in-law's terminal cancer, his nephew's murder, a dear friend's suicide in the wake of priestly sexual abuse, his mother's death, and, yes, the 2016 presidential election - all of which ratchet up his need to examine the bare threads of faith.
Egan proves himself to be a prime traveling companion. Someone with whom you'd gladly share your last blister-pak bandage for the sheer delight of his company, intelligence and curiosity.
That he happens to be a beautiful writer is what makes the 33 chapters unspool effortlessly. It's nothing short of remarkable to find yourself itching to lug around the nearly 400-page book, in hopes of a swatch of time to inhale yet another chapter.
Shortly after telling the story of how his 17-year-old nephew was shot to death by a teenager, Egan sits down with a Benedictine monk in a centuries-old monastery in the Alps. Egan asks the black-robed priest if he believes in miracles, then circles in on a trickier question, one that vexes most anyone who thinks hard about faith: "Do you have doubts?" The priest answers: "About miracles? No. About my faith? Yes. Doubts are allowed by God. Reason can help you come to faith. It's a bit like training for sports. If you only ride a bicycle with the wind at your back, that's not going to help you. You need to ride your bike against the wind."
And so Egan - and any other modern-day pilgrim searching for faith - puts his questions to the wind, walking through ice and snow and rain and brutal heat.
He never gives up. At last standing on a promontory overlooking Rome, Egan beholds the dome of St. Peter's Basilica. As a thunderclap rattles the sky, the pilgrim with whom we've shared the long road recalls Michelangelo's life motto: "the greatest danger, he said, 'is not that we aim too high and miss it, but that we aim too low and reach it.' "

Veronica Escobar: A leading voice on the border

Texto completo: First-year U.S. Rep. Veronica Escobar rose to become one of the most impactful national voices from the border as El Paso faced a difficult year in 2019.
Escobar, who made history as one of the first two Latinas in Congress from Texas, was outspoken against what she saw as dangerous anti-immigrant rhetoric and policies from the Trump administration. She also played a role in the third presidential impeachment in the nation's history.
2019 was a hard year for El Paso, dealing with the arrival of unprecedented numbers of migrants and the unspeakable horror of the Walmart mass shooting.
"This past year has been far more challenging than I ever imagined it would be because it was a challenging time for our community," Escobar, an El Paso Democrat, said in an interview this week with the El Paso Times.
Escobar joins readers' choices of Khalid and first responders who saved lives in the Walmart mass shooting as the El Paso Times pick for Newsmaker of the Year for 2019.
A Texas freshman in Congress Escobar was sworn into the 116th Congress on Jan. 3, 2019, in a House of Representatives with a record number of women and racially diverse lawmakers.
In November 2018, Escobar and Sylvia Garcia of Houston became one of the first two Latinas from Texas elected to the U.S. House of Representatives.
In Congress, Escobar was elected to a freshman leadership post by the House Democratic Caucus' freshman class and selected an assistant whip for the 116th Congress.
She also was named to the House Armed Services Committee and House Judiciary Committee, which are respectively tasked with overseeing military installations and issues including immigration and border security.
"The fact that she's been so quickly integrated into the Democratic plan makes her an obvious star in the emerging Democratic leadership from Texas," said Brandon Rottinghaus, a University of Houston political science professor.
The Texas freshman was instrumental in getting dozens of members of Congress to visit El Paso as the border continues to deal with a myriad of concerns linked to Trump administration border policies amid an influx of asylum-seekers from Central America, Cuba and other parts of the world.
The large number of migrants strained U.S. Customs and Border Protection staffing and resources, filled migrant shelters and had volunteers scrambling to help migrants released by U.S. authorities.
Wait times at El Paso's international border crossings reached a 10-year high with the shifting of CBP staff and worries grew over the health and treatment of detained migrant children and families as well as policies that keep asylum-seekers waiting in Mexico.
Escobar's office pointed out that she worked to secure funding for El Paso, including supporting the National Defense Authorization Act, which included a 3.1% pay raise, the largest increase in a decade, for military service members and 12-weeks parental leave for federal employees.
Her office also resolved 446 cases for constituents seeking Social Security and other benefits worth more than $550,000.
Changes to border policies Immigration is an area that's put the El Paso congresswoman in the national spotlight, Rottinghaus, the University of Houston political science professor, said.
"I think part of the reason she became kind of a shining star nationally was that she was able to highlight some of the atrocities that were taking place at the US-Mexico border, because this is her community and its close to her heart," he said.
Debate over immigration policies will continue but Escobar pointed out that there have been some improvements over the past year.
Relationships built in those Congressional visits to El Paso helped lead to CBP's creation of new civilian jobs to handle the processing and care of migrants at the border, Escobar said.
The new civilian positions should ease some of the stress on CBP agents, Escobar noted.
"I think that it will make a remarkable difference," she said.
Escobar sponsored a bill passed by the House in September to create an ombudsman within the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to improve transparency and handle complaints against border enforcement agencies. The proposal is pending in the Senate.
Escobar says she is having conversations with CBP Commissioner Mark Morgan to give nonprofit migrant assistance groups, such as Annunciation House in El Paso, a presence at processing centers allowing for a more efficient connection between asylum seekers and sponsors in the U.S. after they are released after processed by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
El Paso-area temporary shelters usually host migrants for up to 48 hours while the migrant's sponsor gets them a bus ticket to continue their destination in another part of the United States.
Before serving as a main witness at a House Oversight and Reform Committee on migrant child separation this past summer, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi sang her praises in a New York Times article.
"She's a person who listens to other people; other people listen to her," Pelosi told the New York Times. "She's quite a spectacular member of Congress."
Fernando Garcia, founder and executive director for Borderland for Human Rights, said Escobar had been a "national face" on the fight for human rights.
"No other member of Congress representing El Paso has done so much to bring about oversight and accountability to ill-conceived and abusive border enforcement strategies as Congresswoman Escobar did in just one year," Garcia said. "She was able not only to bring the voices of border communities to Washington, but she led the US House of representatives in passing HR2203, a unique border legislation that promotes vision, human rights, community engagement and necessary oversight for border enforcement institutions."
Trump impeachment Sitting on the House Judiciary Committee, Escobar played a role in the impeachment proceedings against President Donald Trump, Rottinghaus said.
"She's been a Democratic weapon," Rottinghaus said.
"She's not afraid to take on the Trump administration and her questions have been very pointed in the impeachment saga.
The House Judiciary Committee was tasked with drafting the articles of impeachment, which now goes to trial in the Senate.
Impeachment was "really a very tragic circumstance" but as a separate branch of government, Congress is responsible for "keeping the president in check," Escobar said.
"When the president abused his office and put our election in peril we had to act," Escobar said.
Escobar pointed out that she was elected El Paso County judge in the wake of corruption scandals that saw previous County Judge Anthony Cobos sent to federal prison.
"We were outraged as a community. We were outraged," Escobar said regarding local public corruption. "The FBI was at work. Our local journalists were at work.
"This is no different (but) it is more egregious because it is coming from the president instead of a county judge, a school board member or a county commissioner. It's the same outage that I felt," she said.
El Paso Walmart shooting During an August break from Congress, Escobar planned to spend the month at community meetings and coffee-talk "cafecitos" with constituents in El Paso.
On that Aug. 3 Saturday morning, Escobar was having a community meeting at Coronado High School that was abruptly ended as word spread of the Walmart shooting.
"It's still really hard to talk about, coming into August we had a one month recess. I was going to be home for a month. We planned to have town hall meetings and cafecitos."
"The month ended up very different," she said, her voice cracking with emotion. "I spent a lot of time at funerals, hospital bedsides and hospital waiting rooms talking to families trying to provide comfort when I could."
The "domestic terrorist" who allegedly drove nearly 600 miles to target Mexicans in El Paso is an example of the danger of heated rhetoric over immigration and the border, Escobar said.
Escobar said that one of the frustrations for her and other El Pasoans is people outside the community misrepresenting the "border community (as) unsafe, uncivilized, as a place that need to be contained, that poses a threat," she said.
"Those portrayals are not only offensive and untrue and they are harmful," she said.
"I think it's very important to stop the hysteria around immigration. It's used for political purposes. It's meant to divide us. It's meant to inspire hysteria and fear. We need immigration reform rooted in facts and rooted in American values."
The Walmart shooting "is an event that we will move past and that I know we will put it behind us, but it is truly an event that will impact us forever," Escobar said.
"We have to use that tragedy as an impetus for change. We can't be silent in the face of hatred. We can't be silent in the face of racism."

Texto completo: The following poem has been attributed to Mother Teresa. A New York Times article claimed it was actually written by a man named Kent M. Keith. But the author is not as significant as the words and thoughts this verse imparts.
People are often unreasonable, illogical and self-centered. Forgive them anyway.
If you are kind, people may accuse you of selfish ulterior motives. Be kind anyway.
If you are successful, you will win some false friends and some true enemies. Succeed anyway.
If you are honest and frank, people may cheat you. Be honest and frank anyway.
What you spend years building, someone could destroy overnight. Build anyway.
If you find serenity and happiness, they may be jealous. Be happy anyway.
The good you do today, people will often forget tomorrow. Do good anyway.
Give the world the best you have and it may never be enough. Give the world the best you've got anyway. You see, in the final analysis, it is between you and your God. It was never between you and them anyway.
A woman I worked with years ago seemed to think she owned the company, instead of being just an employee of said firm. She would bark out commands and criticize most everything we did. She was unreasonable and self-centered. I found the best way to handle her was simply to avoid her as much as possible. I realized she might have problems in her personal life that she could not manage, and so she tried to take control where she could, despite losing respect from those she worked with. Forgive them anyway.
During our 30 years with the military we were stationed in Texas awhile. As a young bride I would use the laundromat once a week. The man who owned it was a big, tall Texan with a great sense of humor. He would tease me about being a Yankee. However, he unfailingly carried out my laundry. "See y'all next week, Yankee," he would say. This has remained with me through the years. I never felt there were ulterior motives. He was a caring person, even to a Yankee. Be kind anyway.
In our area we get hurricanes, and those on the Outer Banks have had their homes or businesses destroyed by these storms, but they rebuild. Midwesterners face tornadoes that can pulverize homes in an instant. And they rebuild. It's where they prefer to live, and so they pick themselves up and carry on. Rebuild anyway.
My husband wrote his first book about his experience in Vietnam . He put many long hours into it each evening. He was proud of his accomplishment when the product was published. Most of our friends were happy for him and congratulated him on his success. But there was one person who belittled his efforts, even though she had no idea of what she spoke. Jealousy had reared its ugly head because her own husband did not go to Vietnam, and thus was unable to pen his own version. Succeed anyway.
I spent more than 20 years delivering Meals on Wheels weekly in the local area, a volunteer position I truly enjoyed. The clients I met were the nicest folks and were so appreciative. I have volunteered at our church for many of the charities they sponsor over the years. I have taught religious education and babysat friends' children for them. I did not do these things for any reward. I did them to be helpful and grateful. My actions will surely be forgotten, but that is not important in the scheme of things. Don't expect thanks. Do good anyway.
As we start this new year, let's use this poem as a guideline toward a better, kinder life. Give the world your best. Remember, it was never between you and them anyway.

Let's all take a deep breath on ignition interlock idea

Texto completo: Before Christmas, I mentioned that bills have appeared in the U.S. House and Senate that would make ignition interlocks standard features in all cars. These devices require drivers to pass a breath test before the engine will start, ensuring the driver isn't drunk. Most states, including Pennsylvania, require some people convicted of drunken driving to have these installed in their cars, though the specifics differ in each state.
Mothers Against Drunk Driving has pushed for making these machines standard issue in new vehicles, arguing they will save lives. While it's not a perfect system, I think the legislation makes a good deal of sense. Drunken driving is responsible for about 33% of U.S. road fatalities, so anything that could put a real dent in that number should be strongly considered. I don't see much tradeoff, either. The price of failing a breath test is time - your car won't start for a while.
I disagree totally. This is an assumption of guilt that someone has been drinking. A better idea would be for all cars to be required to have a GPS enabled device that would automatically print out tickets to drivers who are speeding for more than one minute at a time. ~ Joe Chando
Now this is an interesting take. I've been more comfortable giving the government tools to enforce road safety than my readers. For example, I don't find speed cameras that obtrusive, but they're enough to send some folks over the deep end. Joe's proposal, however, strikes me as overreach.
Generally speaking, I don't object to giving the government access to personal data - and GPS information definitely fits that bill - as long as it isn't used to punish people.
For example, that vehicle miles traveled tax I'm prone to wax on about would track where you go and charge you the appropriate fee. In return, we would get rid of the gas tax and probably increase funding for highway infrastructure. While I understand the very real downside of trusting the government with our personal data, I see the potential for positive change. Similarly, some car insurance companies offer customers a chance to install tracking devices in their car. The companies use the data to verify good driving practices and will give qualifying drivers a discount.
The ignition interlocks fit that pattern. Sober drivers have to wait an extra second to start their cars but otherwise face no other inconvenience. Drunken drivers wouldn't be allowed to start their cars, preventing them from endangering other travelers and from getting ticketed for drunken driving. And if ignition interlocks are standard features, there shouldn't be a level of shame associated with having one. Interlocks would be commonplace, not a scarlet letter. I don't see how it would be an assumption of guilt.
I believe Joe's ticket proposal goes in the opposite direction, adding features to punish people. Many GPS systems already have speed limits programmed into them, so it wouldn't take too much work to have it notify a police database when you speed. But to me, that's an invasion of privacy I can't get behind.
Here's why universal ignition interlocks are a bad idea. You went to a New Year's party with your wife who doesn't drink. You've had more than you should, so she drives you to your home in the country and you get home around 1:30 a.m. Your wife gets out of the car, slips on some ice, falls and hits her head knocking herself out or worse. What do you do? You're no doctor so you have no idea how serious her head injury may be. It would take an ambulance at least a half hour to get to your home. You're going to want to drive her to the nearest ER - but you can't. Your car won't let you because you've been drinking. Your wife dies of an acute subdural hematoma. Had you been able to get her to a hospital in time, she would have a very good chance of survival. Isn't technology wonderful? ~ David C. Povenski, Macungie
This strikes me as a borderline absurd scenario, but let's play it out. The ambulance can't reach me in time. I have another, older car that doesn't have the ignition interlock, so I buckle up Mrs. Road Warrior and speed to the hospital. I'm drunk, scared and rushing in icy conditions. It wouldn't take much for me to get into a bad accident given the situation. I'd be lucky if my wife was the only person killed.
But technology is wonderful. Instead of driving, I could call a nearby friend or neighbor to drive us. I could summon a ride share like Uber or Lyft. I don't see the ignition interlock as a significant hindrance.
How much longer will the Race Street improvements take?
The Race Street construction project by the airport and FedEx Ground hub has been worked on for well over a year now, but it looks like it might be two more before they are done. Several times traffic has been moved to the new completed section only to be moved back the next day. The area by Airport Road is a mess as well. When can we expect this project to be completed or at least all traffic moved full time to the new completed side while they tear apart the old road currently in use? ~ S. Aaron Guindine, Northampton
According to PennDOT, the entire project has an estimated completion date of fall 2020, meaning we're facing at least eight more months of construction. That said, there's a lot more going on there than just the Race Street construction.
In order to gain final approval for the massive warehouse complex it's building on Willow Brook Road, the Rockefeller Group agreed to make $40 million in upgrades to Willow Brook Road, Race Street and Airport Road. PennDOT is contributing an additional $5 million to the work.
The 850,000-square-foot FedEx Ground hub attracts 14,000 vehicles a day, including 1,800 tractor-trailers. It was allowed to open in November 2018, about two years before the construction will be completed. But FedEx is just the tip of the iceberg. Other warehouses, including an even larger one directly across the street from FedEx and a 300,000-square-foot facility just north of it, will add to the vehicle total once they're up and running.
The construction is supposed to allow trucks and other traffic to flow quickly between Route 22 and the warehouses. Rockefeller has already widened Willow Brook, upgraded the traffic signal at Willow Brook and spent months working on the widening of Race Street between Willow Brook and Airport Road. According to PennDOT spokesman Ron Young, Rockefeller still has to widen Airport Road and Schoenersville Road, upgrade the traffic signal and curb at the intersections of Airport at Race and Airport at Schoenersville and improve drainage in the area.
While this work will go a long way to alleviate the anticipated traffic problems the warehouses will create, I don't think it goes anywhere near far enough. For starters, I think it's rotten FedEx has been allowed to clutter our roads without at least finishing the construction first, regardless of PennDOT's blessing.
But even when the construction is complete, it's the equivalent of throwing a nice coat of paint on a clunker of a car. Sure, this work will improve traffic between the warehouses and Route 22, but Route 22 isn't getting the improvements it desperately needs. PennDOT hoped to eventually widen the highway to three lanes, but even that long-term goal is fading away. The state is funneling money away from local highway needs and toward the interstate system, which means congestion on the Lehigh Valley's key highway will only get worse.

The view of California from 2030 looks to be pretty phenomenal

Texto completo: January 1, 2030
To my three sons:
I'm so proud of you. I especially appreciate that, now that you're 21, 18, and 16 years old, you no longer fight with each other constantly like you did when you were little. You're all doing well in school, and have bright futures ahead.
But please never forget how lucky you've been to come of age in California during this now-concluding decade, the Roaring 2020s. Our state is doing so well that it's hard to remember how fraught things seemed 10 years ago.
Back then, California faced a dire housing shortage and had one of the nation's highest poverty rates. Digital technology was causing massive disruption. Mega-fires were destroying homes and killing people. And the federal government was undermining our desperate efforts to reckon with these problems.
"It's the End of California As We Know It," declared a New York Times column in 2019.
Worse still, neither governments nor businesses had the tools to deal with problems that seemed too big and overwhelming. Amidst these feelings of hopelessness we fell even deeper into a bad habit. We started declaring that we would solve certain problems by a set year — without having real plans to do it.
As a target year, 2030 came up again and again. State politicians talked constantly about the need to reduce emissions to 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030. But those goals weren't accompanied by realistic plans to achieve the requisite remissions reductions — especially in the face of increasing emissions from transportation and wildfires.
2030 fantasies went much further than climate, though. In 2018, the state Department of Education declared a goal under "Global California 2030" of making half of all K-12 students proficient in two or more languages. But no one provided the funding for the immersion programs and foreign language teachers necessary to make it happen.
In retrospect, too many of our 2030 goals were too small and underfunded — like the state's plans to build up long-term care and other services for seniors when the population of people over 65 doubled between 2015 and 2030. Or the University of California's underwhelming "UC 2030," which outlined the modest goal of increasing graduation rates a few points.
Since the three of you were so young at that time, you may not remember the two early 2020s calamities that shook California out of its stupor.
First, the 2019 housing crisis got dramatically worse. The state kept making new demands for housing, but local governments, kept opposing new construction. In January 2021, thousands of homeless Californians, desperate for shelter and action, stormed the Capitol, kicked out all the legislators — and made the building their home for the next year.
At the same time, a recession hit, sparking a federal debt default. In a 2021 poll, half of Californians feared they could become homeless. That drove the Golden State to radical action.
During 2008's Great Recession, California had considered replacing its old Constitution, which made governing in crisis impossible, with a new system. But elites instead decided to make budget cuts and suffer through the pain of unemployment and foreclosures. But by 2021 it was clear that the governing system needed to change to give people and leaders the agency to deal with our problems.
Looking back, the biggest driver of California change wasn't self-driving cars or cheaper space rockets but the new Constitution, drafted in early 2022 and approved by voters later that year. Crucially, this Constitution took powers away from state government, thus creating more freedom for regions and local communities to govern themselves.
The effect was startling, rapid, and deep. The state's regions were able to accelerate housing, remake transportation systems, take back control of crucial utilities, and ramp up economic development on their own. In one constitutional moment, so many pent-up ambitions were unleashed that the entire state seemed to roar with new innovation.
In retrospect, we should have been able to see more of the potential within ourselves. Back in 2019, I traveled the state as a columnist and often marveled that, for all the state's structural problems, our local communities still made progress, from the innovative development of West Sacramento to the fiscal reforms of Glendale. Even in the despair of 2020, Fresno was remaking itself into our next great city, and L.A. was so boldly rebuilding its transit system that city governments in Boston and New York took notice.
Now, if I had written a letter like this to you in January 2020, it would have been dismissed as a fairy tale. People's moods were too dark back then.
But, looking back, the biggest lesson is clear: Deep within our hearts and communities, Californians carry possibilities so grand that the future may surprise us.
Love,
Dad

Increase &#xa0;the federal minimum wage

Texto completo: Opponents of minimum wage laws have long argued that companies have only so much money and, if required to pay higher wages, they will employ fewer workers. Now there is evidence that such concerns, never entirely sincere, are greatly overstated.
Over the past five years, a wave of increases in state and local minimum wage standards has pushed the average effective minimum wage in the United States to the highest level on record. The average worker must be paid at least $11.80 an hour — more after inflation than the last peak, in the 1960s, according to an analysis by the economist Ernie Tedeschi. And even as wages have marched upward, job growth remains strong. The unemployment rate at the end of 2019 will be lower than the previous year for the 10th straight year.
The interventions by some state and local governments, however, do not obviate the need for federal action. To the contrary. Millions of workers are being left behind because 21 states (including New Hampshire) still use the federal standard, $7.25 an hour, which has not risen since 2009 — the longest period without an increase since the introduction of a federal standard in the 1930s. (Vermont’s minimum wage is $10.78.)
The time has come to increase the federal minimum.
House Democrats passed legislation in July that would gradually increase the federal standard, to $15 an hour in 2025 — likely raising the real value above the peak value in the late 1960s — and most of the Democrats running for president have endorsed the legislation. Last year, only about 430,000 people — or 0.5 percent of hourly workers — were paid the federal minimum. The share has fallen in recent years as state and local governments, and some employers, have stepped in. But a much larger group of workers stand to benefit, because they now earn less than the proposed minimum. The Congressional Budget Office estimated a $15 minimum hourly wage would raise the pay of at least 17 million workers.
Among the beneficiaries: people who work for tips. Federal law lets businesses pay $2.13 an hour to waiters, bartenders and others who get tips, so long as the total of tips and wages meets the federal minimum. The legislation would end that rule; the same minimum would apply to all hourly employees. Opponents of the change argue customers will curtail tipping and workers will end up with less money. But eight states, including Minnesota, Montana and Oregon, already have a universal minimum, including for tipped workers, and restaurant workers in those states make more money.
Crucially, the legislation also would require automatic adjustments in the minimum wage to keep pace with wage growth in the broader economy. The current minimum rises only when Congress is in the mood. As a result, the purchasing power of the federal minimum wage has eroded by nearly 40 percent over the last half-century. A full-time worker making the minimum wage cannot afford a one-bedroom apartment in almost any American city.
The simplistic view that minimum wage laws cause unemployment commanded such a broad consensus in the 1980s that the editorial board of The New York Times came out against the federal minimum in 1987. But evidence that any such effects are relatively small has been piling up for several decades. A groundbreaking study published in 1993 by the economists David Card and Alan Krueger examined a minimum wage rise in New Jersey by comparing fast-food restaurants there and in an adjacent part of Pennsylvania. It found no impact on employment. This prompted other economists to test the standard theory. Last year, the British government asked the economist Arindrajit Dube to review the results accumulated over the last quarter-century. Dube reported the sum total of the research showed minimum wage increases raised compensation while producing a “very muted effect” on employment.
Opponents often argue minimum wage increases will encourage automation, but the point is easily overstated. Companies constantly invest in technology: McDonald’s is installing self-order kiosks across the United States, not just at places with higher minimum wages.
More than doubling the current federal standard would be a significant change, and it is not without risk. It is possible that a national $15 standard would produce the kinds of damage critics have long predicted; the Congressional Budget Office puts the potential increase in unemployment somewhere between zero and 3.7 million people, essentially acknowledging the effects are unpredictable. Workers may be most vulnerable in areas where prevailing wages are relatively low. One simple corrective, proposed by Sen. Michael Bennet, of Colorado, would be to include exemptions from the $15 standard for low-wage metropolitan areas and rural areas.
But the successful increases in minimum wage standards across a diverse range of states and cities suggest the broader risk is worth taking. The American economy is generating plenty of jobs; the problem is in the paychecks. The solution is a $15 federal minimum wage.

Texto completo: Days away from the start of a criminal trial at the center of the #MeToo movement and a potential conviction that could send him to prison for decades, Harvey Weinstein is addressing the 26 months since the allegations of sexual misconduct against him were first brought to light.
The highly anticipated rape trial against Mr. Weinstein begins Monday. The former film producer answered eight questions via email.
"The past two years have been grueling and have presented me with a great opportunity for self-reflection," Mr. Weinstein wrote. "I realize now that I was consumed with my work, my company and my drive for success. This caused me to neglect my family, my relationships and to lash out at the people around me. I have been in rehab since October 2017, and have been involved in a 12-step program and meditation. I have learned to give up my need for control."
Since initial bombshell reports by the New York Times and the New Yorker in October 2017, more than 80 women have accused Mr. Weinstein of sexual abuse ranging from harassment to rape. He is charged with predatory sexual assault, a criminal sexual act, first-degree rape and third-degree rape.
The case against Mr. Weinstein centers on an allegation that he raped a woman in a New York hotel room in 2013, and a second woman who accused Mr. Weinstein of forcibly performing oral sex on her at his Manhattan apartment in 2006.
Other Weinstein accusers will be permitted to take the stand as witnesses to illustrate an alleged pattern of abusive behavior.
He has pleaded not guilty and has denied all allegations of nonconsensual sex.
Mr. Weinstein declined to answer if he felt empathy for his accusers.
Defense attorney Donna Rotunno said Mr. Weinstein would be "the first one to say he did bad things," but claimed he's not a criminal.

Where Sarah M. Broom goes, the books go too

Texto completo: Sarah M. Broom won the National Book Award for Nonfiction for her first book, “The Yellow House," which intertwines memoir with the history of a dilapidated but well-loved house and an idiosyncratic city — New Orleans. Broom has a master's in journalism from U.C. Berkeley and has written for The New Yorker and The New York Times Magazine and worked for O, The Oprah Magazine. She lives in Harlem. Not long after winning the award, Broom embarked on a long trip across Europe and into Morocco.
BOOKS: What books did you bring on your trip?
BROOM: I wanted to bring the actual books and I wanted to read writers belonging to each of the places I went to. In Paris, where my trip started, I read Leila Slimani's “The Perfect Nanny," which is so thrilling, but light for me. I normally read these very philosophical writers. Along with that I read “The Dolphin Letters," the collected letters between Robert Lowell and Elizabeth Hardwick. I was reading Toni Morrison's “Sula" in Paris too. Ever since she died I've been reading some of her work every day. I also brought “Conversations with Toni Morrison," a collection of interviews she gave edited by Danille K. Taylor-Guthrie.
BOOKS: What have you read while traveling in Spain and Portugal?
BROOM: In Spain, “A Heart so White," by one of my favorite writers, Javier Marias, who lives in Madrid. Today I finished reading Elizabeth Alexander's “The Light of the World," which is a memoir of her life after her husband died. It just threw me into a melancholic state here in Lisbon.
BOOKS: How do you manage traveling with all these books?
BROOM: It's really hard for me to read on a Kindle. I'm a big writer in books, and I can't read in the tub with an iPad. It's a crucial thing for me to do. My partner makes jokes that I'm not taking a bath at all. I'm just in the water to read. I came from a wild houseful of siblings but if you were in the bathtub people understood you were off limits.
BOOKS: Were you an avid reader as a child?
BROOM: I was always, always, always a reader. Everyone read in our house. One crucial thing was that my sister-in-law lived on our street. She was an insatiable reader and would give me all the books she read. Some were indecent romance novels.
BOOKS: Do you prefer fiction or nonfictions?
BROOM: Typically, I'm a big fiction reader, but this has been a strange year because I went on book tour and was always on a plane. I strangely read more nonfiction as a result. I thought Saidiya Hartman's “Wayward Lives, Beautiful Experiments" was amazing. She writes about urban black women in the early 20th century. The other one I loved was Scholastique Mukasonga's “The Barefoot Woman," which is about her mother in Rwanda. That book is about home and family, the lengths to which her mother would go to preserve those things. Ilya Kaminsky's poetry collection “Deaf Republic" has just blown my mind. Imani Perry's “Breathe" has been huge too. That's something we haven't seen, a black woman addressing her two sons.
BOOKS: Who are the authors you would more typically read?
BROOM: The fiction writers I love are W. G. Sebold, who I read over and over, David Grossman and Nicole Krauss. Jamaica Kincaid's novel “The Autobiography of My Mother" is a biblical text for me. Another biblical text is Elizabeth Hardwick's “Sleepless Nights." I also eat up everything Lydia Davis writes.
BOOKS: Did working in the books department of O Magazine change you as a reader?
BROOM: I learned to read books out loud with an editor there who loved books like they were her children. Often late at night we would read books to each other aloud. It's one of the most joyous things in my whole experience of being a reader is reading books with her there.

Texto completo: Where was "Hadestown"? That was one takeaway from readers of The New York Times who told our theater critics what shows were overlooked on their 2019 Top 10 lists. In widening the scope to include work outside New York, we heard about shows in Atlanta, Washington and Boise, Idaho -- and Off Broadway, too. Here's a sampling of edited responses, with one very passionate "Hadestown" fan standing in for several others:
"Grief Is the Thing with Feathers" at St. Ann's Warehouse moved me to tears. Enda Walsh is one of the most creative artists working in the contemporary theater. MELISSA STERN, NEW YORK
"Hillary and Clinton." Am I the only person who found this a deep and moving exploration of relationships and love? CHARLES BEHLING, DUBLIN, OHIO
"Enter Laughing: The Musical" at the York Theater Company. Very modest in scope, and charmingly old-fashioned, it was one of the funniest shows I have seen in the nine years that I have been obsessed with theater. As a side note, someone in the production must have been obsessed with diction, because this is one of the few shows in which I could understand all the lyrics. MARIA CARMICINO, NEW YORK CITY
As a gay millennial, I've never felt a piece of theater heal something in me and break me at the same time the way "The Inheritance" did. RYAN HAMMAN, CHICAGO
Ardent theatergoers, my daughter and I saw "Tootsie" three times. She thought it should have been called "Jeff" -- just loved Michael's best friend. Sorry it is closing prematurely. May this comedic gem enjoy a long life through many touring companies! MADELINE FARRAN, NEW YORK CITY
"Hadestown" is by far the most electrifying, heartbreaking, heart-wrenching piece of theater I have ever had the pleasure to witness. ERIKA SCALES, OCEAN COUNTY, N.J.
I live in Alabama so I see many more local/regional shows than Broadway. I challenged myself to see 52 live events in 2019. Favorite new shows were "Ever After" and "Becoming Nancy" at Atlanta's Alliance Theater. LAURA LEE VANN, BIRMINGHAM, ALA.
"The Royale" by Marco Ramirez at Geva Theater Center. The way the fight scenes were staged -- with foot-stomping to represent the blows of the boxers -- was phenomenal. The actors were strong and the pacing kept me on the edge of my seat. IRENE STUMBERGER, ROCHESTER, N.Y.
Roundabout Theater Company's production of "Toni Stone" by Lydia Diamond was the year's best play. April Matthis's performance as Toni Stone was transcendent. It's a poignant story about race, gender, sports and Jim Crow America. The audience was on its feet. ANN ROMBERGER, DEERFIELD, MASS.

Texto completo: He made a mark singing in Bach oratorios and Mozart operas. But he also forged a career on the podium -- sometimes singing roles in productions he led.
Peter Schreier, a German tenor renowned for his performances in Mozart operas and Bach oratorios, and for the balance of vocal elegance and dramatic urgency he brought to the German art song, died on Dec. 25 in Dresden, Germany. He was 84.
His death came after an unspecified illness, the German news agency DPA said, citing Mr. Schreier's secretary.
Midway through his career, Mr. Schreier also turned to conducting. He would sometimes sing the Evangelist roles in Bach's St. Matthew and St. John passions as he led the performances.
Mr. Schreier's voice might have lacked the honeyed tone of other tenors who specialized, as he did, in lighter lyric opera roles and German lieder. But he won consistent praise for a combination of technical know-how and musical insight.
Reviewing a song recital by Mr. Schreier at Carnegie Hall in 1982, The New York Times's John Rockwell noted that his tonal palette was somewhat dry. But above all, he wrote, Mr. Schreier was "an artist, and one particularly suited to the intimacies of the lied," whose "delicate application of musical skills to dramatic ends" was impressive.
The pianist Andras Schiff collaborated frequently with Mr. Schreier in recitals and recordings, performing all three Schubert song cycles with him as well as works by Schumann, Mozart, Beethoven and Janacek. He said in an email that Mr.
Schreier as a child sang with a boys' choir in Dresden, giving him a "real foundation of musical tradition" that led to exemplary interpretations of Bach's passions and cantatas.
Mr. Schreier was also a unique lieder singer, Mr. Schiff added, who "could color each verse with different expressions according to the mood of the text, something that very few singers could do."
Mr. Schreier's involvement with conducting, which began around 1970, was a natural extension of his approach to singing, especially his feeling for "instrumental singing," as he described it in a 1997 interview with Bruce Duffie for WNIB, a former classical music radio station in Chicago.
"Bach treats the voice like a musical instrument," Mr. Schreier said. "Instrumental singing means using the voice with a little bit of vibrato, like an oboe or a flute." Bach, he added, is "very precise in how to phrase and articulate" the vocal parts. His goal of inculcating that articulate, verbally alert approach to singing inspired Mr. Schreier to conduct these scores.
A 1985 New York Times review of his recording, as a conductor, of the "St. Matthew Passion" praised Mr. Schreier for respecting the work's "natural equilibrium" by allowing dance rhythms to abound and giving full range to bursts of "theatrical ferocity."
Peter Max Schreier was born on July 29, 1935, in Meissen, a town in eastern Germany. His father, a church cantor, gave him his first music lessons. At 8 he entered the preparatory division of the Dresdner Kreuzchor, the boys' choir of the main Lutheran church in Dresden; he remained a member of the choir for several years, even after his voice broke.
In 1954 he began private voice lessons in Leipzig while singing in the Leipzig Radio Chorus. Two years later, at 21, he entered the Dresden State Opera's training academy where he studied singing and conducting. After graduating in 1959, he joined the company as a tenor.
His career grew steadily, with performances in leading houses of Europe in operas by Rossini, Massenet, Strauss and, especially, Mozart. He was highly esteemed as Prince Tamino in Mozart's "Die Zauberflöte," the role in which he made his 1967 Metropolitan Opera debut, though he appeared only eight times in all with that company. Several of his important roles are captured on classic recordings with Karl Böhm, Colin Davis and other major conductors.
He was drawn to certain 20th-century German operas, especially the title role of Hans Pfitzner's "Palestrina," and sang the Physicist in the 1974 Berlin premiere of Paul Dessau's "Einstein."
But Mr. Schreier was no fan of most contemporary opera productions, something he made clear in the 1997 interview.
He was quite dismayed by the director Peter Sellars's updated staging of Mozart's "Così Fan Tutte." which presents the story as a modern sexual roundelay set in a seedy diner, because, he said, "I don't think you can equalize Mozart with everyday vulgar attitudes." He also found the depiction of Mozart in the Milos Forman film "Amadeus" "crude" and "distorted," explaining that "we don't need to use the media or vulgarities and exaggerations to make Mozart popular."
As his career advanced, Mr. Schreier devoted increasing attention to song, especially German lieder. He performed and recorded Schubert's "Die Schöne Müllerin" song cycle with pianists, with a fortepianist and in a version accompanied by guitar, following a popular practice in Schubert's day.
He retired from singing in 2005, three days before Christmas, with a performance of Bach's "Christmas Oratorio" in Prague, conducting the orchestra and chorus while also singing the role of the Evangelist. Thereafter he settled with his wife, Renate, who survives him, in a country house outside Dresden, where he contented himself with gardening, reading and swimming. He is also survived by two sons, Torsten and Ralf, and several grandchildren.
In a 1989 interview with The Times, Mr. Schrier genially defended his practice of singing the Evangelist roles in Bach passions while also conducting. As the Evangelist he would face the audience and deliver the sung narrative, which is minimally accompanied, then turn around to lead the choral and orchestral music.
In this way, he said, one "can truly be the spiritus rector" of the entire performance, invoking the lofty Latin phrase for guiding spirit, the role assumed by the no-nonsense choir directors he watched during his boyhood years in Dresden.

77TH ANNUAL GOLDEN GLOBES 8 p.m. on NBC. Netflix will likely be the big winner at the 2020 Golden Globe Awards. The streaming giant has 34 nods in total: "Marriage Story," starring Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver, received six alone, the most of any movie. Among the other contenders are "1917," "The Irishman" and "The Joker," for best drama, and "Dolemite Is My Name," "Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood" and "Rocketman" for best musical or comedy. The Hollywood Foreign Press Association, the group that produces the Globes, faced a backlash for excluding women in several major categories, including best director and motion picture. The best drama series category includes nominations for "The Morning Show," "Big Little Lies" and "Killing Eve," while "Fleabag," "The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel" and "Barry" will compete for best comedy series. Ricky Gervais returns to host for the fifth time, which he says will be his last. Expect plenty of jabs.
GOD FRIENDED ME 8 p.m. on CBS. This feel-good drama series follows Miles (Brandon Micheal Hall), a reluctant hero who meets and helps New Yorkers in need through a mysterious Facebook account called God. In this midseason premiere, Miles meets a Holocaust survivor who wants to know whether his sister is still alive. And, in a twist, Joy (Jessica Lu) has a hunch that all of the people Miles has been helping are clients of the same insurance company.
TOLKIEN (2019) 8 p.m. on HBO; stream on HBO platforms. Nicholas Hoult stars as J.R.R. Tolkien in this biopic about the writer of "The Lord of the Rings" and "The Hobbit." The film chronicles Tolkien's early days as a young orphan in Birmingham, England, who bonds with three friends and forms a fellowship. He finds love at his boardinghouse, enrolls at Oxford and enlists in the army during World War I, and, all throughout, shares his fascination with language. The film received mixed reviews. Critics praised the performances but said the movie could do with more imagination and less obvious nods to Tolkien's legacy.
What's Streaming
SHERLOCK HOLMES (2009) Stream on Amazon; rent on Google Play, Vudu or YouTube. For a wildly refreshing, albeit puzzling, take on Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes, look no further than Guy Ritchie's action-packed adventure. This Sherlock Holmes (Robert Downey Jr.) cracks a conspiracy involving a villain (Mark Strong) who comes back from the dead and an underground magical fraternity not just with his inquisitive mind, but with his bare knuckles and long list of weapons. Jude Law plays Holmes's trusty partner, John Watson, while Rachel McAdams plays a seductive thief and Holmes's love interest. The film's visual style was met with some head-scratching, but Downey Jr. took home a Golden Globe for his role. "There are worse things than loutish, laddish cool," A.O. Scott wrote in his New York Times review. "As a series of poses and stunts, 'Sherlock Holmes' is intermittently diverting."

Texto completo: Since its 1957 premiere, The New York Times has tracked the musical's evolution, covering its casting, its politics and its role in the Cold War along the way.
From the time it was announced, the new revival of "West Side Story" directed by Ivo van Hove has drawn curiosity: Just how radically would the beloved classic be transformed? (What -- no "I Feel Pretty"?)
But the original -- with its lush Leonard Bernstein score, finger-snapping Jerome Robbins choreography and lyrics by a then little-known Stephen Sondheim -- was itself hailed as startlingly new almost from its opening night, on Sept. 26, 1957.
"Everything in 'West Side Story' is of a piece," Brooks Atkinson of The New York Times wrote the next day about the show's retelling of "Romeo and Juliet" against the backdrop of gang conflict. "Everything contributes to the total impression of wildness, ecstasy and anguish."
In the years since, The Times has tracked the musical as it moved from stage to screen and back again, touching on the politics of casting; its value as Cold War propaganda; and its relationship with the evolving city whose rhythms and troubles it aimed to capture.
With the new revival in previews and scheduled to open next month at the Broadway Theater, here's a look back at nine stories The Times has told about the show over the years -- and one tantalizing "what if?" that we missed.
Make Way for ... "Gang Way"?
The musical was first mentioned in The Times in 1956, but the newspaper was sometimes confused about what it was called. A brief item on June 24, 1957, listing rehearsal dates for shows in the upcoming Broadway season, referred to it by the working title "Gang Way!"
Arthur Laurents, who wrote the show's book, later said he had tossed that in as a joke, after a producer said "West Side Story" was a bad title. His mock title "even made it on the back of the scenery," Laurents later recalled.
The First Glimpse
Times readers got their first look at the show on Sept. 8, 1957, a few weeks before the opening, when the paper published a photo spread by Fred Fehl, a Vienna-born refugee who was among the first to use light, fast cameras and existing stage lighting to take candid performance shots.
"Before Fehl, the usual Broadway picture was posed," the theater scholar William Stott wrote in the introduction to a 1978 collection of Fehl's photographs. "After him, the usual picture was done his way."
Scouring for Stars
A few days before the opening, The Times recounted how the creators had held "one of the most notable casting marathons of modern theater," an eight-month, coast-to-coast "dragnet" that scoured settlement houses, high schools, ballet companies, college choirs and, yes, casting agents' offices.
Ultimately, they cast only professionals, well known and not, including Carol Lawrence, who arrived "heavily made up and bejeweled, trying to create her impression of a Juliet from Puerto Rico," The Times reported.
"I told her to go home and take a shower and come back," Robbins, who directed the show, said.
There had been auditions in East Harlem, The Times noted. But aside from Chita Rivera (who played Anita), only one Puerto Rican was cast -- Jamie Sanchez, 18, who played Chino, one of the Sharks.
Breezes, or Diseases?
Atkinson's review called the musical "a profoundly moving show that is as ugly as the city jungles and also pathetic, tender and forgiving." But not everyone was enamored by the show's social commentary.
Even before opening night, The Times reported, some Puerto Ricans on the island and in New York had raised objections -- especially to a lyric in the song "America" that rhymed "island of tropical breezes" and "island of tropic diseases."
In the article, headlined "The Facts Don't Rhyme," Dr. Howard A. Rusk, the paper's medical columnist, called the line "a blow below the belt." In fact, he wrote, Puerto Rico had dramatically lowered the incidence of malaria, cholera and yellow fever and had "no significant disease problems related to its tropic climate."
"Would that we in New York City could find as effective measures to control our social blight of juvenile delinquency," he added.
In his 2010 memoir, "Finishing the Hat," Sondheim called the outrage understandable, but said, "I wasn't about to sacrifice the line that sets the tone for the whole lyric." Still, the offending passage was rewritten for the 1961 movie.
East Bloc Story
In April 1959, The Times noted the visit by some "frolicsome Bolshoi dancers" on tour, who mostly couldn't follow the English dialogue but joined the cast backstage for a post-show mambo lesson.
Effort to enlist the show as Cold War cultural outreach -- or propaganda -- proved more complicated.
In Sept. 1959, Max Frankel, one of the newspaper's Moscow correspondents, filed a dispatch in the form of a letter to the drama editor, criticizing the State Department's decision not to sanction a tour in Moscow, lest it promote "an unglamorous aspect of American life."
Frankel, in what he called a bit of reporter's "agitprop," lamented the decision as a missed opportunity to showcase American commitment to artistic freedom. "Many here may be impressed more with the stark fact that we are not only free to produce such dramas but that we are also proud to send them abroad," he wrote.
The Russians, it turns out, didn't wait for permission. That December, The Times published a UPI story reporting that they intended to stage their own unauthorized adaptation, leaving out most of the music and dancing "to emphasize the theme of racial conflict."
The Missing Maria
The 1961 movie drew rave reviews, with Bosley Crowther of The Times calling it a "masterpiece." But one crucial performer went unnamed, in the film's credits or, initially, anywhere else -- Marni Nixon, who provided the singing for Natalie Wood's Maria.
A year later, The Times reported on Nixon's successful campaign to win royalties for the soundtrack (which Nixon, in her 2006 memoir, said were granted only after Bernstein agreed to give her a small percentage of his royalties).
"Assistant hair dressers and third assistant directors are getting screen credit," the singer, who remained officially uncredited, told The Times. "Why shouldn't they give screen credit to someone who does the singing for a star?"
A Puerto Rican Maria
In 1971, The Times briefly noted what was believed to be the first production of "West Side Story" with an all-Hispanic cast -- an outdoor production sponsored by the city and performed in a park near Lincoln Center.
In 1980, Broadway got its first Puerto Rican Maria when Josie de Guzman took on the role for a revival at the Minskoff Theater, directed again by Robbins.
In a joint profile of her and Debbie Allen (who played Anita), the Times reporter Nan Robertson described de Guzman's initial "revolt" when the production darkened her hair. "Oh my God, I am Puerto Rican -- why do they have to darken my hair?" she was quoted as saying. They also darkened her skin, Robertson noted.
Today, de Guzman, who was nominated for a Tony for her performance, recalls the show as "a perfect experience," though she also recalled her reluctance to alter her appearance.
"I didn't want to do any of it," she said by telephone last month. "After six months, I said to Robbins, 'Can I not put on anymore of this makeup?' He said, 'O.K. The critics are gone. Yeah, sure."'
"The sensibility nowadays is so different," she continued. "I think it's dangerous to judge from the mind-set of today."
Is "West Side Story" Dated?
In 1957, the show's depiction of gang violence had shocked critics. By the 1980 revival, the show struck some as close to a period piece, at least sociologically.
"These days, it's hard for me to imagine how my parents thought this show too 'adult' for an 8-year-old when it passed through Washington, D.C. during its original pre-Broadway tryout," Frank Rich, who had recently been hired by The Times, wrote in a 1980 essay surveying a flood of Broadway revivals.
"The sociology and liberal faith of Arthur Laurents's book are now fairly meaningless," he continued. "We no longer feel that ghetto tragedies can be overcome by pleas for tolerance and understanding."
Going Bilingual. (Maybe.)
The 2009 Broadway revival, directed by Laurents, was the last to be led by a member of the original creative team. It also made efforts to add -- or restore, depending how you look at it -- some gritty authenticity.
In an interview with The Times, Laurents, 91 and long known for trading jabs with erstwhile (and, by then, mostly dead) creative partners, called Robbins's 1980 revival bland. He also didn't mince words about the movie, which he summed up as "bogus accents, bogus dialect, bogus costumes."
So in his version, the choreography was adjusted, including in the scene where Anita is assaulted, which took on a heightened edge of violence. "We don't treat them as lovable little thugs," Laurents told The Times. (Cast members, the Times reported, also referred to the incident explicitly as a "rape.")
But the most talked-about change was hiring Lin-Manuel Miranda, whose "In the Heights" had just won the Tony for Best Musical, to translate some dialogue and some of the songs into Spanish.
Reactions were mixed, and five months into the run, some of the Spanish translations reverted to English to ensure "a bigger dramatic wallop," as one producer put it.
... O.K., We Missed One
Among the more tantalizing (and possibly apocryphal) threads of "West Side Story" lore popped up not in The Times, but in an interview Laurents gave to The Hartford Courant shortly before his death in 2011, in which he addressed rumors that Disney had once proposed an animated version of "West Side Story" with ... cats?
"Someplace I have a seven-minute reel that they made with white cats and black cats," he said. "I remember the Maria cat came down the rope of a steamer illegally into the country. In the end I remember the Tony cat got run over. You can't believe how terrible it was."

Texto completo: As Congress reconvenes in the new year, it remains unclear when and under what circumstances the Senate will hold a trial on whether President Trump should be removed from office for "high crimes and misdemeanors." That uncertainty needs to end.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi should promptly transmit the two articles of impeachment approved by the House to the Senate so that arrangements for a trial can begin. For his part, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell should agree that witnesses whose testimony could be vital can be called to testify either by the Senate on its own initiative or in response to requests by the House's managers or Trump's lawyers.
If McConnell is unwilling to commit to allow witnesses, Republican senators who want a fair trial should make it clear to the majority leader that they will join with Democrats to force his hand. Already one Republican senator, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, has expressed concern over McConnell's statement that the Senate would be working in "total cooperation" with the White House counsel's office. On Monday Susan Collins (R-Maine) said she was "open to witnesses," though she thought decisions on whom to call should wait until after arguments by lawyers and the responses to questions submitted by senators.

Good for them for once again demonstrating their willingness to think independently. If just a few more Republicans insisted on witness testimony, that would produce the necessary majority. A trial with witnesses would be both fair to Trump, whose lawyers should be able to cross-examine them, and in the national interest. As Sen. Doug Jones (D-Ala.) put it in an opinion column in the Washington Post: "For Americans to have confidence in the impeachment process, the Senate must conduct a full, fair and complete trial with all relevant evidence regarding the president's conduct."
Jones rightly argued that a fair trial would require testimony from past and present administration officials who didn't testify in the House impeachment investigation, notably acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney (who is also director of the Office of Management and Budget) and former national security advisor John Bolton.
Bolton has been free with public comments about a variety of issues -- most recently U.S. policy toward Iran. But he has failed to share with Congress what he knows about Trump's efforts to persuade Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, and any connection between that request and the decision to stall hundreds of millions of dollars in congressionally approved aid. Bolton's lawyer tantalizingly said in November that Bolton was "personally involved" in many events, meetings and conversations relevant to the impeachment inquiry.
The New York Times recently reported on a meeting in August in which Bolton, Secretary of Defense Mark Esper and Secretary of State Michael R. Pompeo unsuccessfully sought to convince Trump that releasing the aid was in the interest of the United States.
Did Trump explicitly acknowledge at that meeting or at any other that he was withholding aid in order to pressure Ukraine to announce the investigations? Testimony from Mulvaney, Bolton and other officials could answer that question.
The Senate also should hear from former New York City Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, Trump's personal lawyer.
House Democrats decided not to delay their impeachment vote because they were denied testimony from some witnesses. They were right not to let themselves be held hostage to the White House's efforts to stall the proceedings and keep witnesses from testifying.
But now, with the process moving to the Senate, it's appropriate to try to obtain such testimony. Republicans who insist Trump did nothing wrong should support such an effort. Of course, some witnesses might decline nevertheless, citing the privileged nature of conversations with the president, and the issue could be entangled in litigation.
Still, the goal should be a fair and complete trial. That is not what McConnell seems to have in mind, although he did say recently that Senate Republicans haven't "ruled out witnesses."
Yes, the Republican majority in the Senate gives that party a control over the process comparable to that exercised by the Democratic majority in the House. But that doesn't give McConnell the license to rush through a half-baked trial when the allegations against the president are so serious. A handful of Republican senators could and should make the majority leader recognize that fact.

Texto completo: Disneyland-tied bus service ends
Tuesday will be the last run of the Disneyland Express bus that takes travelers to and from LAX and John Wayne Airport.
The shuttle offered a convenient way to get to and from airports, stopping at or near more than 60 hotels around the Anaheim theme park.

Round-trip tickets for adults cost $48 from LAX and $35 from John Wayne Airport.
Shuttle operator Coach USA Southern California recently told Walt Disney Travel that the bus service would be terminated, an email from company spokesman Sean Hughes said.
It is the second shuttle service to end service in a month.
On Dec. 12, SuperShuttle, the shared-ride van service that served L.A.-area airports, confirmed it would cease operations nationwide Dec. 31.

Global Entry extends renewal
If you're worried that your Global Entry application still says "pending" and your privileges are about to expire, you can relax. Customs and Border Protection, which oversees the program that allows expedited passage through U.S. customs and U.S. airport security, has granted up to a year's extension if your application is in process.
The program is so popular that it's receiving as many as 7,000 applications a day, the agency said. That has created a backlog that has grown by 50,000, up from 300,000, in recent weeks.
The approval process was slowed in the summer when agency personnel were dispatched to the U.S. border with Mexico to address what the agency called a "humanitarian" and "security" crisis. The LAX office that handles interviews closed June 23 but has reopened, although it is not yet at full capacity.

Mobile Passport app is touted
An alternative to Global Entry -- but only for customs entry -- is free and available by app. Mobile Passport expedites you through customs. It does not involve an interview process.
Waiting times are minimal, Customs and Border Patrol said of Mobile Passport, which it called an "underutilized" option.
Mobile Passport recently announced it would begin helping travelers with passport renewal, including urgent requests for new documents.

This airport is a trip unto itself
Does anybody really want to spend time in an airport? Yes, if it's Changi Airport in Singapore, Stephanie Rosenbloom writes in the New York Times.
Her descriptions of her airport vacation sound fanciful, but she's not making it up. You will find a waterfall and a forest, butterflies and tube slides; you can watch movies for free at any hour.
Changi is consistently rated the top airport in the world and has become more beloved with the addition of what is an airport version of an adult amusement park.

Bias detected in facial scans
Facial recognition is coming to airports and bringing problems. Seattle has put on the brakes, but not Los Angeles International Airport, Christopher Reynolds reported recently ( bit.ly/facialrecognition
LAX).
Writing in USA Today, Curtis Tate explains why the problems in the algorithms matter so much when it comes to this technology. Part of the issue: Researchers detected racial bias in the results, which has implications beyond airport security.

Micronations: It's a small world
Quickly, how many micronations are there? Micronations form when people decide to break away from the country where they live, Quartz reports.
You can read about micronation history, including one near us: Zaqistan, which exists inside Utah's borders. Answer to the question of how many: 67, based on Google Maps.
Some of these are just for fun, but some are serious, with passports (attention, country collectors), money and flags.
Some even ban books, Quartz reports, including the Kingdom of Elleore, which banned "Robinson Crusoe" because of how it depicts small islands.

GEAR
This light strip is a bright idea
A bright little flashlight is a must on every traveler's packing list, but mine now has to share the spotlight with the diminutive new PeakPlus motion sensor battery-powered light strip, which has 10 LED bulbs that will light up a dark hotel room closet or car trunk.
The strip, powered by four AAA batteries, lights up only in darkish spaces, so battery life isn't wasted. The lights shut off automatically after about 30 seconds but can reactivate for another 30 seconds if need be.
A detachable magnetic bar on the back of the casing can be pulled off and affixed to a solid surface using the attached adhesive strip (but you won't want to use that option in temporary lodgings or rental cars).
The light bar weighs 5 ounces with batteries and comes in packs of three. I keep one (without the magnetic bar) in my purse for instant illumination.

Bird-watching in Seal Beach
You don't have to go all the way north to the Sacramento National Wildlife Refuge to see beautiful marshes and birds, as was suggested in Julie Graulich's Dec. 15 article, "A Refuge for Them and Us."
As a volunteer at the Seal Beach National Wildlife Refuge, I would ask you to consider visiting there. Because it's on a military installation, reservations are required, and only U.S. citizens are allowed.
The monthly tours are the last Saturday of the month. Call (562) 598-1024 for a reservation.

Vans or rentals to the airport
Re: Catharine Hamm's article about how to get to LAX in the wake of SuperShuttle's demise ("Let's Find Your Way to LAX," On the Spot, Dec. 15): There is another way to get to LAX that we have used many times. We live in Oceanside, and we rent a car from a Hertz office that is five minutes from our home.
Although the price has increased from about $50 to $80 over the years, it's pretty easy. We drop the rental at the Hertz lot at LAX and take the Hertz bus to the terminal.
Upon our return, we take the Hertz bus from the terminal, rent another car (about $125, because it is an "on airport" rental) and drive it home.
We always allow tons of time before the flight so we don't have to worry about returning the car and getting to the airport. We have also spent the night at a hotel near the airport if we have an early flight, so we can take the hotel's shuttle to the airport.

::
The article didn't mention Karmel Shuttle, which also picks up in many places in L.A and Orange counties. We have used its white van service from Anaheim Hills to LAX for years. Karmel also serves Long Beach Airport, John Wayne Airport and the San Pedro cruise terminal.
Karmel operates by reservation only. This means that it does not drive around the airport trying to pick up additional persons to fill vans. It drops off passengers at the LAX departures area and picks them up outside of baggage claim.
Our cost for a round-trip reservation from Anaheim Hills to LAX was $122.80 for two. (Auto Club members get a 10% discount.) Reservations may be made online at Karmel.com or by calling (888) 995-7433.

I have one more option to suggest. Ask around to see whether any of your friends or co-workers know of an independent driver. We use one who is very reasonable and reliable. She's self-employed but takes referrals only from current customers.

Texto completo: Stern built a rapport with many of the people around him despite a dictatorial management style that probably wouldn't fly today.
The last time I saw David Stern was the day after the greatest night of my professional life.
It was a Friday in September in Springfield, Mass., minutes before the Basketball Hall of Fame's 2019 induction ceremony. The previous evening, I had noticed Stern in the crowd as I nervously ambled through my speech after receiving the Hall's Curt Gowdy Award, but we missed each other in the aftermath.
So I was thrilled when I spotted him heading toward the red carpet outside Symphony Hall, where the ceremony would soon begin. Impartial journalists probably aren't supposed to say such things, but I couldn't help my ever-nostalgic self.
"I miss you," I told Stern.
"I don't miss you," Stern replied, explaining that he was actually seeing my work more often now as a voracious reader of The New York Times.
He then skipped right past the pleasantries about the peak achievement of my career to tell me he had been wanting to call me about several things I had written.
"And tell you how wrong you are," Stern said.
The Commish was not finished.
"When are you going to get it right about player empowerment?" Stern said. "Have you forgotten Kareem Abdul-Jabbar wanting out of Milwaukee and forcing a trade to the Lakers? Have you forgotten Wilt Chamberlain living in New York when he played for Philadelphia? This has been happening in our league for years."
With that, Stern trudged away. If he wasn't pressed for time, I'm sure the lecture would have been louder and longer, because with Stern lectures always were. It was our final interaction before he died on Wednesday, nearly three weeks after he had surgery for a sudden brain hemorrhage.
Throughout his 30-year run as commissioner, as anyone who ever jousted with the Columbia-schooled lawyer would tell you, engaging with David J. Stern meant you had to be prepared for him to castigate you. My longtime colleague Jack McCallum, who chronicled Stern for decades for Sports Illustrated, likened such interactions to "trying to do the Times crossword puzzle while he shouted insults at you."
For all of his unmatched impact in steering the league from its darkest days in the late 1970s and early 1980s to a position of global prominence second only to world soccer, Stern ran the N.B.A. in an unforgiving manner befitting his surname. He was a workaholic, a perfectionist and, yes, often a bully.
"It's terrifying go in his office," Charles Barkley recently shared on an "Inside The N.B.A." broadcast on TNT, recounting the dread Stern could inspire in those he summoned to his old mahogany-paneled lair at Olympic Tower in Midtown. Yet Barkley, the Hall of Fame player turned broadcaster, was quick to add that "even when he was giving it to me, he did it like a father figure."
He was the commissioner I grew up with, too, as a teenager mesmerized by those unforgettable commercials in the 1980s, invariably set to a lively track from The Pointer Sisters, proclaiming basketball to be "America's Game." Then, suddenly, I was writing daily about Stern and his "fannntastic" league in the 1990s soon after Michael Jordan's gravity-defying brilliance and the worldwide appeal of the Dream Team had taken the game to Europe, Asia and beyond.
Mark Cuban's arrival as the owner of the Dallas Mavericks on Jan. 4, 2000, 20 years ago this weekend, changed my interactions with Stern forever. The brash, outspoken Cuban was the Barkley of team owners; reporters assigned to cover the Mavericks could scarcely dare to leave his side for fear of missing the latest inflammatory quote or sideline fit that would bring a fine from the league office.
Through Cuban's first few seasons, stalking Stern became mandatory for me as staff writer for The Dallas Morning News. It was my responsibility to chase Stern as he walked away from any public appearance in hopes he would answer a few one-on-one questions about Cuban's latest transgressions.
The greeting was always the same: "What do you want now, Stein?" -- except there was almost always an expletive thrown in.
"He and I had many battles, but most ended with a hug or a laugh," Cuban said by email Wednesday night. "We didn't always see eye to eye, but we always knew we were on the same side."
Maybe Stern was overly cranky and combative at the end of his reign. Maybe Stern should have stepped down sooner than he did. Maybe Stern should have shown more remorse about his role in the SuperSonics' exit from Seattle in 2008 -- or the league's failure to expel Donald Sterling, the former team owner of the Los Angeles Clippers. Stern's successor, Adam Silver, quickly did so after taking over when recordings emerged of Sterling making racist statements.
Yet for all the negativity in Stern's later years, it is hard to quibble with the assessment put forth by two of the most influential voices in the modern game. Golden State Warriors Coach Steve Kerr and the popular writer Bill Simmons both described Stern in recent days as the most important non-player who ever graced the league.
At his worst, Stern was branded an effective dictator, but I see it as a tribute to Silver that his first five seasons in charge, with such a gentler style, featured so many more highs than lows. I've always believed that a commissioner needs to stray closer to dictator status, and inspire the sort of fear Barkley described, to maintain the requisite authority. Silver's collaborative approach is certainly more appropriate in 2020, with the Stern approach increasingly frowned upon, but in some ways it may be even harder to pull off.
Stern loyalists counter the tales of condescension, arrogance, fury and other unflattering portrayals with reminders of his compassion, social consciousness and how hard he fought for minorities and women in the game. For all of Stern's willingness to play the villain, Stern's death inspired the sort of heartfelt condolences and tributes befitting a political dignitary.
Lon Rosen, the longtime agent for Magic Johnson, called to make sure I hadn't forgotten how Stern wouldn't stop at ensuring that Johnson would be able to play in the 1992 All-Star Game mere months after announcing he had contracted H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS.
"Earvin's real dream was to play in the Olympics," Rosen said. "David had to make that happen. It was not a fait accompli, but David was able to get Earvin permission to play on the Dream Team."
Rosen, for me, was a natural for swapping Stern stories. Now the executive vice president and chief marketing officer of the Los Angeles Dodgers, Rosen helped assemble the unforgettable news conference on Nov. 7, 1991, where Johnson, now one of the Dodgers' primary owners, suddenly retired from the Lakers "because of the H.I.V. virus that I have attained."
My first N.B.A. assignment as an out-of-college journalist was joining the Los Angeles Daily News army covering that news conference. My specific instructions: a sidebar on Stern.
Rosen went on to share that, as close as Johnson and Stern were, there were times even Magic got scolded. In 1990, Rosen was pursuing a one-on-one game in Las Vegas pitting Magic against Michael with a pay-per-view television audience and a huge cash prize. Stern implored Johnson to back out, convinced that it was a bad look for the league for its stars to duel like boxers, and Magic did.
"There was another time we were in a contract dispute with Converse and he yelled at me like I was a child: 'You're going to ruin Magic Johnson!"' Rosen recalled. "But that was David."
That was Stern -- to everyone. You understood and accepted it, which is why I urged him in that last encounter to please call any time he wanted to highlight my stupidity.
You understood, most of all, that Stern wanted anyone who had anything to do with the N.B.A. to care as deeply as he did. Even the pesky scribes like me who just covered it.

Texto completo: Traveling can be stressful enough without your favorite small creature.
Flying with your cat or dog is probably no one's idea of fun -- least of all your pet's. But there are ways and tools to make the trip safer, calmer and more comfortable for everyone involved. After logging hundreds of air miles -- one particularly intrepid staffer flew cross-country with both a cat and a dog -- and after consulting with vets, airline officials and animal behaviorists, the animal lovers on Wirecutter's staff recommend the following items.
Sherpa Original Deluxe Carrier
This carrier has a flexible wire frame that can compress down to fit under the seat in front of you, which most airlines require. ( $ 30 from Amazon)
Dri-Soft Plus Bath Towel
Bring a towel that's fairly new (no dangerous strings!) for your pet to burrow into, and another to drape over the carrier in busy, scary places. ( $ 7 from Bed Bath & Beyond)
Highwave AutoDogMug
Squeeze the water up into the attached bowl for your pet to drink, and then let the excess drain back into the bottle. ( $ 15 from Amazon)
Iris Neat 'n Dry House-Training Pads
Line the carrier with these, and bring spares. Even a short flight can upset your pet's digestive tract -- this goes for cats as well as dogs. ( $ 42 from Amazon)
Trip-It Pro
The Pro version's searchable terminal maps let you pinpoint pet-relief areas before arriving at the airport, which makes waiting for your flight a lot easier. ( $ 49 from Apple or Google Play) Feliway and Adaptil Travel Sprays
These sprays use synthetic feline and canine hormones to soothe nervous pets. Studies indicate they're effective, but your mileage may vary -- consult your vet first. ( $ 13 each from Amazon)

Sugar Hating
My manager is a nightmare. Name anything that exhibits the worst of bad management and she's done it, including presenting my ideas brazenly as her own. Recently, I did a favor for a co-worker -- not a personal favor, a work favor. As thanks, she surprised me by bringing in a box of fancy mini-pastries -- two dozen! -- for me and to share with my team.
My manager sits next to me. After my co-worker walked away, the manager commandeered the pastries. She gave me one, then walked around meting out one here and one there to people she likes, having nothing to do with my team. With easily 18 pastries left, she put them under her desk, telling me she was taking the rest home to her family. (They don't appear to be starving; she and her husband live in a mansion and drive expensive cars.)
Aside from my horrible manager, I like the company, and I don't want to quit. What, if anything, could I have done so this kind of thing doesn't happen again? I am furious.
-- Anonymous
Gifts shouldn't have stipulations. If I'd been you, I probably would have joked to the pastry-giver: "To share? Yeah, right!" And then, while everyone was chuckling, wordlessly placed the pastries in my desk drawer for consumption by me alone. THEY'RE MINI.
One interpretation is that your manager is a true-blue psychopath who remorselessly stole your gift before your very eyes. This is statistically unlikely; the research consensus is that individuals with psychopathic features make up just 1 percent of the population, on top of which, per the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, antisocial personality disorder is "much more common in males."
I'm not a doctor, but I am highly critical of everyone around me. I have been blessed in my career to have worked alongside multiple people who expended so much effort cultivating an air of mysterious unknowability and fearsome ambition, I could only conclude that they wanted colleagues to conclude they were psychopaths. I blame prestige television and the early-2000s vampire boom for glamorizing psychopathic tendencies. The sad truth is that most people are not charming enough to be psychopaths. I include your manager in that group.
More likely, your manager is simply a jerk who, in addition, didn't quite understand what was happening in that moment: that the treats were in recognition of your extra work. Is it possible she felt that she, as supervisor, had delegated the work favor to you, and that this was her thanks for effective management? This interaction is so strange and specific I cannot conceive of what a second instance of "this kind of thing" might be, let alone envision the conditions that would result in such events becoming recurrent.
(In fact, it is so specific that if your manager or anyone in her household ever sees this, they will likely instantly recall the day she brought "easily 18" mini-pastries home to the family mansion, which may make things awkward for you. If she has found these words: Madam, intentional or not, this was bad behavior, and you really should treat your subordinates to a box of the extravagant mini-pastries we all now know you can afford.)
What you could have done: The instant you sensed she intended to move the goodies to a second location said, "I'm going to send an email to make sure the team knows we got these as a thank you," and then sent one. That way, even if she had, bizarrely, hand-delivered mini-pastries only to her favorite people -- a group that did include you -- she would have been publicly identified as their custodian. When team members came calling, you, innocent as a lamb searching for a fallen apple blossom, could have turned to her and asked, "We still have some of those mini-pastries, right?"
Mistakes become harder to correct with every passing second, and by the time she tucked that box under her desk with no protest from you, her error had become your reality. I maintain you could have corrected her then, even if awkward. (I encourage everyone to tolerate low-grade social awkwardness whenever possible; this improves character.)
I'm relieved this incident did not make you want to quit a job you like, where you apparently are liked or at least appreciated by your co-workers. You will be happier if you keep your interactions with and thoughts about your manager to a polite minimum, and focus on (1) those aspects of work you enjoy and (2) your favor-driven cultivation of generous supporters.

I teach at a large university where instructors are expected to upload students' final grades in a centralized online system at the end of each semester. I have no problem with this simple data entry task and see it as a routine part of my job. What concerns me are the instructions that accompany it: "Please note, instructors should be using IE (Internet Explorer) to avoid any potential issues." What is "Internet Explorer"? I don't have this on my computer. In violation of the policy, I've been successfully uploading grades using programs that are not "Internet Explorer" without incident. But my success makes me all the more puzzled by the instructions. Should I try to get "Internet Explorer"? Or continue on in violation of policy?
-- A.C.
Internet Explorer is a discontinued web browser introduced by Microsoft in 1995, and the best course of action would be to never think about it again for the rest of your life.
I ran your concerns by a browsers expert at The Times to confirm there was no specific security reason for you to use Internet Explorer for this task, and the first thing he said after waking up in the hospital from the heart attack your question induced in him was that you are in fact more likely to expose yourself to security vulnerabilities by using Internet Explorer, which Microsoft is no longer actively developing.
Even Microsoft employees publicly dissuade people from using Internet Explorer as their default browser. Microsoft would love you instead to use Microsoft Edge, the company's intended replacement -- to which I say, "I'm sorry, Microsoft, are you still talking?"
Whatever you've been doing is perfect.

Texto completo: He deftly manipulated electronic images to produce otherworldly, sometimes jarring visions. He also founded, with his wife, a landmark performance space.
Woody Vasulka, an experimental video artist who found inspiration in sources as diverse as René Magritte, nuclear war and technology, and who was a founder of the Kitchen, the landmark avant-garde performance space in Manhattan, died on Dec. 20 at his home in Santa Fe, N.M. He was 82.
His death was confirmed by his wife, Steinunn (Bjarnadottir) Vasulka, known as Steina, who was an occasional collaborator on Mr. Vasulka's projects. She said she did not know the cause.
In the early 1970s, Mr. Vasulka was one of a group of avant-garde artists who saw video as an emerging medium as compelling as film, sculpture and painting.
"Video is an art unto itself, with its own reality, visual language and its own conception of time and space," he told The New York Times in 1972 when he organized a video festival of mostly abstract works at the Kitchen, which he and his wife had opened a year earlier in SoHo. The low cost of videotape, he added, encouraged experimentation.
Mr. Vasulka, who recognized in Magritte a spirit of fantastical adventure like his own, adapted Magritte's Surrealist painting "The Golden Legend" (1958) -- which shows loaves of baguettes floating past a blue sky -- into an even more bizarre adventure in bread.
In "The Golden Voyage" (1973), Mr. Vasulka, his wife and two other collaborators turned Magritte's loaves into a mobile brigade: Baguettes fly across desert and island landscapes, surveil a man walking on a beach, gather in the sky like an invading force, soar in balletic flight and hover over a nude woman in outer space.

A year later, the Vasulkas conceived "Noisefields," a hypnotic visualization of the energy of an electronic signal. In that work, a pulsating, flickering circle with ever-changing colors is set against a throbbing backdrop of snowy, colorized static and whirring, repetitive clattering noise.
"Our goal with 'Noisefields' was that it was like our ancestors looking at fire, as something that you'd look at very intensely as it changed colors and it kept going and going," Ms. Vasulka said by phone. "When we'd introduce our work, we'd use it to tease the audience, and when they were teased enough we'd turn it off."
Bohuslav Vasulka was born on Jan. 20, 1937, in Brno, Czechoslovakia. His father, Petr, was a metal worker in a factory, and his mother, Florentina (Semorova) Vasulka, was a homemaker. The Vasulkas lived near an airfield in Brno that by the end of World War II had become a graveyard for military aircraft.
"My first interest as a kid was to take apart the most complicated machines of that era, the German fighter planes," he told Crosswinds, a New Mexico alternative weekly, in 1992. "You can find everything there to drive your fantasy crazy. Europe was a huge junkyard after the war -- you could find weapons and human fingers in the dump."
After graduating from an industrial engineering school in Brno, he served in the Army and then earned a diploma from the Film Academy of Performing Arts in Prague, where he studied documentary production. While in Prague he met Ms. Bjarnadottir, a violinist and artist from Iceland; he also wrote poetry and made short documentaries. The couple married in Prague and moved to Manhattan in 1965.
As the Vasulkas immersed themselves in video and sound experimentation, they opened the Kitchen for avant-garde video artists, dancers, actors, playwrights and musicians. (It got its name because it was located in an unused kitchen at the Mercer Arts Center.)
"This place," the Vasulkas wrote in their manifesto for the Kitchen, "was selected by Media God to perform an experiment on you, to challenge your brain and its perception."
They left the Kitchen after a few years, and Mr. Vasulka joined the faculty of what is now the University at Buffalo, where he taught video art. The Kitchen remains a vibrant cultural home to emerging and existing artists at its current location on West 19th Street.
While in Buffalo, Mr. and Ms. Vasulka both won Guggenheim fellowships, which helped fund their video work. But after several severe winters there, they moved to Santa Fe in 1980.
By then they had been using an arsenal of technical instruments -- a video synthesizer and image processors, among others -- to bend and manipulate video and audio to their creative wills. With the design engineer Jeffrey Schier, Mr. Vasulka developed a device -- the Digital Image Articulator -- that breaks video images, pixel by pixel, into manipulable digital components.
"Art of Memory" (1987) became Mr. Vasulka's best-known work -- a reshaping and manipulation of photographs and newsreel footage of 20th-century wars that rolls, unfurls and overlaps onscreen like jagged, disturbing nightmares. It unfolds against a tableau of imagery of the American Southwest.
"Through constant electronic transmutation, every ghostly image becomes a malleable sculptural form that morphs into the next to achieve a poignant and ultimately tragic memory theater," Gene Youngblood, the author of "Expanded Cinema" (1970), an early examination of video as an artistic medium, said in an email. "The most telling legacy of Vasulka's career is that all those 'effects' are now standard presets in professional video studios."
Ms. Vasulka said that "Art of Memory" arose from her husband's childhood during the war.
"He saw dead bodies when the Russians liberated Brno from the Germans," she said. "It occupied him so much; if you look at Europe during that terrible time, it never goes out of your mind."
In addition to his wife, Mr. Vasulka is survived by a sister, Vera Skyjova.
"The Brotherhood" (1998), one of Mr. Vasulka's most ambitious projects, took shape throughout the 1990s and was not made for a screen. It is an installation of six interactive machines made from military equipment, much of it discarded around Los Alamos. All of it fascinated Mr. Vasulka.
A system of projectors, speakers, screens, lights and sensors controls the way each machine turns, twists and extends in response to the motions of viewers. The robotic head in one of his six machines came from a bomber's navigation unit; another part was a bombing rack.
"I've surrounded myself with these war machines," Mr. Vasulka said in an interview on his website, "and have adopted them."

Texto completo: After months of protests and an electoral defeat for pro-Beijing political parties, an official with a record of difficult assignments is on the way.
BEIJING -- The Chinese government abruptly replaced its top representative in Hong Kong on Saturday evening, installing a senior Communist Party official with a record of difficult assignments in inland provinces that involved working closely with the security services.
The top representative, Wang Zhimin, was replaced as the head of the powerful Central Liaison Office in Hong Kong by Luo Huining, the official Xinhua news service said. The move came two months after the Chinese Communist Party's Central Committee called for measures to "safeguard national security" in Hong Kong, although few details have been released.
Mr. Wang became the first senior official to lose his job after seven months of often-violent protests in the city and a stinging rebuff to pro-Beijing political parties in local elections six weeks ago.
He had devoted most of his career to Hong Kong issues and had worked closely for decades with the city's business and political elite. But he attracted broad criticism in Hong Kong and Beijing alike for failing to anticipate the broad-based groundswell of hostility provoked by an extradition bill last spring.
Mr. Wang then made no move to stop scheduled elections for neighborhood district councils in November, in the mistaken confidence that pro-Beijing candidates would maintain their longstanding dominance. Pro-democracy candidates captured 87 percent of the seats.
"The massive defeat of the pro-establishment camp at the district council elections sealed his fate, but I think even before then, they had decided to remove him because he repeatedly failed to predict the mood of the city," said Willy Lam, a specialist in Chinese factional politics at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.
Yet until Saturday, Beijing had at least publicly stood by Mr. Wang. When Reuters reported after the elections that he might be removed, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs office in Hong Kong dismissed the report as "false news."
Mr. Wang's successor, Mr. Luo, has served as the top official, Communist Party secretary, in two provinces. Xi Jinping, China's top leader, has found in him a representative whose main qualification appears to be political loyalty and experience in tough security measures, but who has little familiarity with Hong Kong.
From 2003 to 2016, Mr. Luo rose through the ranks in Qinghai Province, in western China, where Beijing has pursued increasingly stringent policies toward a large Tibetan minority. Mr. Luo became governor there in 2010 and then Communist Party secretary in 2013, according to his official biography.
In 2016, Mr. Xi put Mr. Luo in charge of cleaning up Shanxi Province, a northern coal-mining area plagued by corruption scandals. Mr. Luo oversaw a purge of the party's senior ranks there, as a series of investigations documented broad misconduct.
Mr. Luo is an unexpected choice to run the Central Liaison Office because of his relatively advanced age, 65, and because he has already worked as a provincial-level leader in mainland China. He was also only a month into his latest job, in China's national legislature, suggesting that the decision to send him to Hong Kong came together fast.
The Beijing leadership previously selected younger men with more expertise in the unique issues posed by Hong Kong, which has a different legal and economic system from mainland China because it was a British colony until its return in 1997 to Chinese sovereignty.
Like other Chinese provincial leaders, Mr. Luo has had some dealings with Hong Kong, especially over investment and business. He held talks with his predecessor, Mr. Wang, at least once, leading a delegation from Shanxi Province to Hong Kong in late 2018. On that visit, Mr. Luo also met the city's chief executive, Carrie Lam, to discuss investment opportunities. But he appears to have no public record of ideas for ending the unrest in Hong Kong.
By contrast, Mr. Wang had spent most of his career as a Hong Kong specialist before he was named to run the office in Hong Kong in 2017.
When Mr. Luo stepped down as party chief in Shanxi, in November, he said he took pride in helping to clean up the province's "political ecology" and overhaul its economy, two tasks that Mr. Xi may also want him to take on in Hong Kong. Mr. Luo also said then that he was most grateful to have the backing of Mr. Xi and other central leaders.
Mr. Wang and Mr. Luo are among the roughly 200 members of the Chinese Communist Party's elite Central Committee, which gathers roughly once a year to discuss policy and review the performance of China's political leadership.
The extradition bill supported by Mr. Wang last spring would have allowed Hong Kong residents to be sent to the opaque and often-harsh justice system in mainland China. Mrs. Lam suspended legislative consideration of the bill in mid-June and her secretary of security, John Lee, formally withdrew it in October.
There was no public indication on Saturday night of what, if any, role Mr. Wang might play in the future.

White House Notifies Congress of Deadly Drone Strike Under War Powers Act

Texto completo: The notification, required within 48 hours of introducing United States armed forces into hostilities, only contained classified information, a senior congressional aide said.
The White House sent Congress on Saturday a formal notification under the War Powers Act of the drone strike ordered by President Trump this week that killed Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, two congressional officials said.
The notification, required by law within 48 hours of introducing American forces into armed conflict or a situation that could lead to war, has to be signed and then sent to Congress, according to the officials with knowledge of the plan.
Lawmakers expected the document to publicly lay out the White House's legal justification for the strike on General Suleimani, Iran's top security commander, who officials have said has been behind hundreds of American deaths over the years. But the notification first sent to Congress late Saturday afternoon only contained classified information, according to a senior congressional aide, likely detailing the intelligence that led to the action. It is unclear whether the White House will send a separate, unclassified document.
Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a statement Saturday evening that the notification "raises more questions than it answers," including "serious and urgent questions about the timing, manner and justification of the administration's decision to engage in hostilities against Iran."
"The highly unusual decision to classify this document in its entirety compounds our many concerns, and suggests that the Congress and the American people are being left in the dark about our national security," Ms. Pelosi said.
The document itself was brief, a senior Democratic aide said. But its contents are all but certain to animate a fierce debate among lawmakers about the reach of presidential war powers and Congress's role in matters of military conflict. Many Democrats have called the strike against General Suleimani, which threatens to escalate tensions between the United States and Iran and reverberate throughout a violent and volatile region, illegal and unauthorized. They are already searching for ways to curb Mr. Trump's ability to strike Iran in the future.
Mr. Trump's advisers have maintained that they were operating on credible intelligence showing that General Suleimani was involved in imminent plans to attack American interests in a handful of countries. They have not detailed that intelligence, and Democratic lawmakers, among others, have raised questions about its veracity.
Briefing reporters on Friday, Robert C. O'Brien, the White House national security adviser, pointed to Mr. Trump's "constitutional authorities as commander in chief to defend our nation" as justification for the strike. He also cited the measure Congress approved in 2002 granting President George W. Bush the legal authority to wage war on Saddam Hussein and the government of Iraq.
While Republicans praised the action against General Suleimani as a definitive blow against a longtime enemy, Democrats voiced concern that the president was risking a new war in the Middle East, and argued that the White House exceeded its legal authority by conducting the strike without explicit authorization from Congress.
"President Trump has no authority to take us to a military conflict with Iran. Period," former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. said on Saturday at an event in Des Moines.
A small group of lawmakers on Friday were already preparing efforts to cut off any further military confrontation with Iran without Congress's express approval, setting up an array of legislative vehicles Democrats may use to try to rein in the president's war powers.
A number of bipartisan resolutions similar to those measures had already been considered last year, but lawmakers declined to take them up or ensure their survival in pieces of must-pass legislation.
Senator Tim Kaine, Democrat of Virginia, introduced a resolution on Friday invoking the War Powers Act that would a force a debate and vote in Congress to prevent further escalation of hostilities with Iran.
Representative Ro Khanna, Democrat of California, and Senator Bernie Sanders, independent of Vermont, said in a statement that they would resurrect legislation to prohibit any funding for offensive military force in or against Iran without prior congressional authorization.
That measure was passed in the House last year along bipartisan lines, with nearly two dozen Republicans voting in support of it, but was later stripped from the must-pass annual defense bill. The political dynamics of taking such a vote after the strike, however, may change the calculus for Republicans and a number of Democratic lawmakers in conservative districts who initially backed the measure.

Texto completo: Johanna Lindsey, a romance novelist whose best-selling paperbacks ranged through the centuries, chronicling passionate and independent women in pirate ships, Viking forts, medieval castles, the American West and on a distant planet called Kystran, died Oct. 27 at a hospital in Nashua, N.H. She was 67.
Her death was first reported in late December by the New York Times, which said 'the family was too devastated by her death to announce it earlier.' She had Stage 4 lung cancer, said Sally Marvin, publicity director for the Simon - Schuster imprint Gallery Books, which published several of her novels.
Ms. Lindsey was one of the most popular romance authors of her era, selling more than 60 million copies in at least 12 languages " a book every eight seconds, Avon calculated in 1993. She was also a pioneer of the modern historical romance novel, which originated with the hotblooded work of Kathleen E. Woodiwiss and Rosemary Rogers, only a few years before Ms. Lindsey made her debut at 25 with 'Captive Bride' (1977).
'She's one of the foundations of the genre,' romance novelist Beverly Jenkins said in a phone interview. 'Most stories in mass-market fiction were male centered. With Woodiwiss and Rogers and Lindsey, you had these female-centered stories with women who were bound and determined to set their own pace, to define love, to fracture what people associated women with.'
Ms. Lindsey, she added, 'inspired thousands and thousands of women to write their own stories' and helped demonstrate 'that love stories were valued, and that women were not just pawns or secondary characters, but could be the point of a book.'
Her novels were frequently described as fairy tales, happy-ending stories of heroines who travel halfway around the world and end up finding love, and sexual satisfaction to boot. Filled with witty banter and one-liners, many of her novels also featured arranged marriages, mistaken identities, kidnappings, abductions, overbearing family members and abusive lovers, with some scenes of outright rape.
In writing about enslaved or trapped women who fell in love with their captors, some of Ms. Lindsey's admirers said, she was simply working within the conventions of her time, while also offering a critique of the patriarchy and of what it means to fall in love.
'She was trying to understand how you talk about women and female sexual pleasure,' said English professor Jayashree Kamble, a vice president of the International Association for the Study of Popular Romance. 'Does it have to be through companionate marriage? Do you have to have an emotional connection with this particular person?'
'In Lindsey's books,' Kamble added, 'there was something very joyful about sexuality.'
Johanna Helen Howard (some sources reverse her first and middle names) was born March 10, 1952, in Frankfurt, Germany, where her father served in the Army. The family lived in France for several years before moving to Hawaii, where Ms. Lindsey graduated from high school in Kailua, near Hono lulu.
She worked in data processing before marrying Ralph Lindsey in 1970 and soon became engrossed in historical romances, sometimes reading one a night. After the birth of her second son, with her husband working nights and weekends as an estimator for a landscaping company, she began writing 'Captive Bride.'
'I'd been thinking about a plot for one for a long time, but I was sure that somebody else would come out with it first,' she told the Hono lulu Star-Bulletin in 1981. ' 'Desert sheikh, romance, kidnapping' " that's about all I started with. The book wrote itself. . . . I just sat down one day and wrote the middle scene, the love scene in the tent. I amazed myself " I couldn't stop writing.'
Ms. Lindsey's later novels included 'Gentle Rogue' (1990), a pirate yarn; 'Warrior's Woman' (1990), a science-fiction romance set on Kystran in 2139; and the 12-book Malory-Anderson Saga, which opened with 'Love Only Once' (1985), about a 'hot-tempered' Englishwoman abducted by a rogue. The series concluded in 2017 with 'Beautiful Tempest,' involving a kidnapped debutante and Caribbean pirates.
By 1990, when Ms. Lindsey inked a 10-book contract with Avon, she was writing two books a year, and each of her previous 19 novels had sold at least 700,000 copies, according to a Times report. Her sales were buoyed in part by the novels' eye-catching cover art, perhaps most notoriously on 'Tender Is the Storm' (1985), which showed an apparently naked man, his crotch blocked from view by a swooning woman's chest. 'When a man's passion explodes into violence,' read the tag line, 'only a woman's desire can turn it to love.'
Two years later, a golden-maned model named Fabio appeared on the cover of a romance novel for the first time, according to the feminist website Jezebel, for Ms. Lindsey's Viking epic 'Hearts Aflame.' To much of romancelandia's horror, Ms. Lindsey and Fabio remained inextricably tied, as the model's appearances on subsequent Lindsey covers seemed to eclipse the pathbreaking subject matter of their books' contents.
'She defined Fabio, not the other way around,' said Jennifer Prokop, romance correspondent for Kirkus Reviews. Still, she added by phone, 'Those covers had almost a gravitational force of their own.'
Ms. Lindsey's husband died in 1994, and they had three sons. Complete information on survivors was not immediately available.
In 1981, Ms. Lindsey told the Star-Bulletin that she spent her days writing in bed, longhand in a spiral notebook, taking two hours off only to watch the soap operas 'General Hospital' and 'One Life to Live.'
'Since I was old enough to appreciate a good novel, I've been a romantic,' she told interviewer Kathryn Falk for the book 'Love's Leading Ladies.' 'I enjoy happy-ending love stories more than any other type of reading. Romance is what comes out of me.'
'I would be literally lost ,' she said, 'if I had to give it up.'

Texto completo: Michael Eric Dyson is a sociology professor at Georgetown University, a New York Times contributing opinion writer, and a contributing editor of the New Republic and the Undefeated. His 21st book, 'Jay-Z: Made in America,' was released in November.
You call Jay-Z, 'Robert Frost with a Brooklyn accent, Rita Dove with a Jesus piece.' And I argue that even though he's world-famous and globally acclaimed, he's really underrated for the kind of sophisticated nuanced deployment of homophones, metonymy, simile, metaphor, braggadocio, allusion. That stuff is just dripping throughout his lyrics. Plus, he's putting that poetry to music. He's rapping to a beat. It's pretty remarkable that he does this without writing a single word down. It's like Homer, you know, in terms of an oral tradition. He's able to say what he has to say and record how he thinks and feels with such accuracy and poignancy. And to command a wide range of reference to culture and pop culture and intellectual culture. So, it was a delicious treat to be able to share some of that stuff in the book, stuff I've been discovering over the years in teaching a class on him.
In talking about Jay-Z and what he means to America, you talk about hustle and how that's such a distinctly American trait or tradition. Exactly. Conservative historian Walter McDougall [argues] that the central motif of American history is hustling. It defines us in terms of ambition, desire " whether [for] people on the make, on the take or trying to make something of their lives. And I wanted to connect it to what Jay-Z is doing and what these young men and women are doing in many of these communities that are not regarded very highly. And yet, what they are about is quintessentially American. The impulse, the energy, the desire to do something, make something out of nothing.
Do you remember the first time you heard a Jay-Z song? Yeah: 'Can't Knock the Hustle.' When I heard the entire album, I was, like, 'Wow.' I mean, he's giving us the mafioso story, the narrative crafted about the gangster " but it was the remorse, the regret, the grief, the horror, the suffering. The album has a song called 'Regrets.' In order to be successful in that hustling life, you got to learn to live with regrets. You know, the existential anxiety of the hustling life. A figure on the underside of the American society, the other side of the law, the underground, but who's thinking about the moral and ethical implications of what he's doing. And trying to grapple with that and piece together his worldview from the fragments of his broken life.
Did any of that resonate with your own growing up? I could definitely identify with it. I could understand where it came from, what forces drove it and what the consequences would be to an uncritical embrace and celebration of some of the ways of life that were being amplified in that music.
I grew up in Detroit, and it was a very violent place. [I was] part of a gang at a certain period " but got a chance to escape that.
As a frequent commentator, you often debate people from very different points of view. Do you have moments you feel like it's a productive exchange of ideas, not just: Who says it better, and then we go home. When I go to college campuses and talk to people, they say, 'Hey, you're not like on TV.' I said: 'I got five minutes on TV, bruh, I'm throwing bombs. I got a bazooka.' I'm trying to kill everything walking, rhetorically, right? That's the performative aspect. It's horrible at a certain level. But it's also trying to make a point. They're used to white guys doing that. White guys can be angry and enraged. I do it: 'What are you so angry for, black man?' So I understand that. But I'm coming at you. And I'm going to do it with high intelligence and words.

Environmental law overhaul discounts climate change

Texto completo: White House proposal aims to expedite drilling, infrastructure projects
The Trump administration will instruct federal agencies to no longer take climate change into account when measuring the impact of major infrastructure projects, according to two senior administration officials " a sweeping overhaul of one of the nation's most consequential environmental laws.
The proposed changes to the 50-year-old National Environmental Policy Act are aimed at speeding approvals for pipelines, oil and gas leases, highway construction and other kinds of development. The law, which was last updated in 1978, has proved one of the most potent stumbling blocks to President Trump's push to accelerate oil, gas and coal extraction across the country.
Under NEPA, agencies are required to analyze the extent to which proposed federal actions affect everything from endangered species to water quality to greenhouse gas emissions linked to climate change.
Under the Obama administration, the Environmental Protection Agency raised objections during a NEPA review of the giant Keystone XL pipeline that delayed it. More recently, federal judges halted oil and gas leasing in Wyoming as well as the Trump administration's push to restart coal leasing on public land on the grounds that the Interior Department did not properly assess the climate impacts of these decisions.
Two administration officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the proposed changes will not be announced until next week, said the plan will shorten the time frame for the environmental reviews. The reviews also will no longer consider the cumulative effects of a project, they said.
'Climate change is no longer a top priority for these reviews,' one official said.
The New York Times first reported details of the proposal Friday evening.
In a statement on Jan.-1, the law's 50th anniversary, Trump criticized the extent to which it has delayed projects.
'While the goals of NEPA remain the same as they did 50 years ago, the environmental review process designed to improve decision making has become increasingly complex and difficult to navigate,' the president said in the statement. 'Project sponsors and ordinary Americans seeking decisions on permits from the federal government can face significant uncertainty and delays that can increase costs, derail important projects, and threaten jobs for American workers and labor union members.'
Stephen Schima, senior legislative counsel for the nonprofit organization Earthjustice, said in an interview that the effect of the proposal could be enormous. NEPA 'sets the floor' for how more than 80-federal agencies solicit public input and evaluate the government's impact on the environment, he said.
'They're clearly trying to institutionalize climate denial into federal decision-making,' Schima said. 'This is the existential threat to how the government incorporates climate change into their decision-making process.'
The regulations would have to be finalized before they could take effect, and environmental groups are sure to challenge them in court.
Industry and some union officials have urged the White House to overhaul the decades-old policy and make it easier to launch transit and highway projects, drilling and other developments. Trump is particularly interested in the plan because he thinks it will accelerate the construction of pipelines across the country.
'POTUS is obsessed with pipelines,' one official said. 'He wants to get these pipelines built.'
Barely a month ago, a collection of major industry groups " including the American Petroleum Institute, the National Association of Home Builders and the American Chemistry Council " wrote to administration officials that overhauling NEPA would boost the economy.
'Reducing delays and uncertainties associated with infrastructure investment and related projects has the potential to support more and better-paying jobs throughout the country,' the coalition wrote to the head of the White House's Council on Environmental Quality. 'Improved regulatory predictability would allow businesses to plan and invest with confidence while enhancing economic productivity and efficiency.'
Daniel Schneider, a spokesman for the White House council, declined to comment in detail about the proposal. But in an email, he noted, 'CEQ's NEPA regulations have not been comprehensively updated in more than 40-years.'
'President Trump promised a more efficient process to provide Americans timely decisions on permits for vital infrastructure projects that provide good jobs, reduce traffic congestion, and enhance the quality of life in neighborhoods across our great country,' Schneider said. 'The Trump administration is focused on improving the environmental review and permitting process while ensuring a safe, healthy, and productive environment for all Americans.'

For Russia, 'an exploitable victim'

Texto completo: 'Wow,' Michael McFaul, a former U.S. ambassador to Moscow, exclaimed on Twitter in late October. 'We still need to understand why Trump remains so intent on appeasing Putin.'
What set off McFaul was testimony from a top State Department official that 'senior officials in the White House' had blocked the department from condemning Moscow for attacking Ukrainian ships in the Azov Sea. And on that day it was telling that even McFaul, a Kremlin-watcher for nearly 40 years, was struggling to put his finger on exactly what had driven the president of the United States into the Russian strongman's arms, tugging the Republican Party along with him.
Trump's affinity for Vladimir Putin seemed to glow red during a now-notorious 2018 Helsinki news conference when he sided with the former KGB agent's denials of election interference over U.S. intelligence agencies' findings. But so much else has erupted before and since, from revelations that he was secretly pursuing a Moscow hotel deal during the 2016 campaign, to exposés of his business relations with Russian oligarchs, to his continuing criticism of the NATO alliance, to his acquiescence to Russian troops taking over abandoned U.S. bases in Syria, to his pressure on Ukraine's president to say publicly that Kyiv, not Moscow, had hacked the computers of the Democratic National Committee.

It makes you wonder, as the TV detectives say. Now comes Malcolm Nance, a former U.S. Navy counterterrorism specialist turned regular MSNBC Trump basher, seeking to expose the underside of the Trump-Putin relationship. Like everybody else who's plowed this ground " including the FBI, whose controversial counterintelligence case on the Trump campaign came under sharp scrutiny from the Justice Department inspector general " Nance hasn't resolved the question. Instead, in 'The Plot to Betray America,' he's gathered up scraps of evidence to make a persuasive, if circumstantial, case that the president is indeed Moscow's man in Washington. In essence, it's a progress report in a mole hunt.
Why do once-loyal men go bad? Mole hunters have an acronym for it: MICE, which stands for money, ideology, coercion/compromise and ego/excitement. Trump qualifies for three out of four, in the telling of Nance (and many others who've long followed Trump's career), that explain his attachment to Moscow. Ideology's not one of them, notwithstanding Trump's crude nationalist populism that in many ways apes Putin's kleptocratic rule. According to New York state records revealed by the Smoking Gun, he changed party registrations at least five times over the years.
He did, however, get caught up in the mid-1980s 'Gorby fever' (as New York Times columnist William Safire mocked it) that swept the world when Russian leader Mikhail Gorbachev and President Ronald Reagan began negotiating nuclear arms reduction agreements. In typical Trump fashion, of course, he thought he, the great dealmaker, could finish the job single-handedly. As Nance writes, Bernard Lown, a Nobel Peace Prize winner, asserted that Trump said if Reagan would let him do it, 'within one hour the Cold War would be over.' Trump 'had Russia mania in 1986,' Lown said. In 1987, he was in Moscow scouting construction sites.
On his arm was his first wife, Ivana, a native of communist Czechoslovakia, whose Moscow-controlled spy service, the StB, had long counted her father as an informant, according to authoritative reporting cited by Nance. Her 1977 marriage to Trump had prompted the Czechs to open a dossier on him. 'We knew that Trump was influential. He didn't hide that he wanted to become president one day,' the StB's then-chief said years later. 'We were interested in learning more things about him.'
Especially his weaknesses. In Trump, they found two, a hunger for money and a raging ego, not to mention a lust for beautiful women. They began dangling opportunities " the Miss Universe contest, Trump Tower Moscow. They treated him like a potentate, affording him the bedroom suite reserved for princes and presidents at the Moscow Ritz-Carlton. Then, in the wake of Trump's Atlantic City bankruptcies, Nance recounts, Trump found new sources of cash from Russian sources, including the Kremlin-connected Deutsche Bank, Russian oligarchs who bought luxury condos in Trump Tower and 'New York City allies from the former Soviet Union' who partnered with him in real estate deals from SoHo to Baku. One of them, Felix Sater, would eventually be accused of laundering hundreds of millions of dollars stolen from a Kazakhstan bank 'to develop a Trump Tower in Moscow,' according to a lawsuit reported by the Associated Press.
That Trump wanted the details of his financial sources kept secret (along with his tax returns) was all the better, Nance notes: It gave Putin a better hold on him, a tool for coercion.
From the beginning, Russia had used 'the MICE strategy to bring him under its sway, as his interest in Russia clearly blinded him,' Nance theorizes. 'He was a potential asset and an exploitable victim worth keeping.'
Judging by his Russia-related decisions and pronouncements, the strategy has worked. Trump has dismissed Moscow's subversion of American politics and pursued debunked conspiracy theories tying Ukraine to Hillary Clinton's campaign. Equally important to Moscow's strategic goals, he's disparaged NATO and, by championing Brexit, undermined the European Union.
To longtime observers, Trump's transformation of the GOP from hard-line cold warriors to muted bystanders has been astounding. Here again, Nance points to the possible role of foreign money, citing a Dallas Morning News report that Russian oligarchs and front groups provided millions of dollars for the campaigns of key Republican senators.
All in all, Nance has produced an impressive clip job, assembling scores of reliable media reports, congressional hearings and the findings of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into a persuasive whodunit narrative. Alas, it remains a circumstantial case. It's a prosecutor's pitch to a jury of millions of Americans who don't get to vote for almost another year.

It's like Homer, you know, in terms of an oral tradition. He's able to say what he has to say and record how he thinks and feels with such accuracy and poignancy. And to command a wide range of reference to culture and pop culture and intellectual culture. So, it was a delicious treat to be able to share some of that stuff in the book, stuff I've been discovering over the years in teaching a class on him.
In talking about Jay-Z and what he means to America, you talk about hustle and how that's such a distinctly American trait or tradition. Exactly. Conservative historian Walter McDougall [argues] that the central motif of American history is hustling. It defines us in terms of ambition, desire " whether [for] people on the make, on the take or trying to make something of their lives. And I wanted to connect it to what Jay-Z is doing and what these young men and women are doing in many of these communities that are not regarded very highly. And yet, what they are about is quintessentially American. The impulse, the energy, the desire to do something, make something out of nothing.
Do you remember the first time you heard a Jay-Z song? Yeah: 'Can't Knock the Hustle.' When I heard the entire album, I was, like, 'Wow.' I mean, he's giving us the mafioso story, the narrative crafted about the gangster " but it was the remorse, the regret, the grief, the horror, the suffering. The album has a song called 'Regrets.' In order to be successful in that hustling life, you got to learn to live with regrets. You know, the existential anxiety of the hustling life. A figure on the underside of the American society, the other side of the law, the underground, but who's thinking about the moral and ethical implications of what he's doing. And trying to grapple with that and piece together his worldview from the fragments of his broken life.
Did any of that resonate with your own growing up? I could definitely identify with it. I could understand where it came from, what forces drove it and what the consequences would be to an uncritical embrace and celebration of some of the ways of life that were being amplified in that music.
I grew up in Detroit, and it was a very violent place. [I was] part of a gang at a certain period " but got a chance to escape that.
As a frequent commentator, you often debate people from very different points of view. Do you have moments you feel like it's a productive exchange of ideas, not just: Who says it better, and then we go home. When I go to college campuses and talk to people, they say, 'Hey, you're not like on TV.' I said: 'I got five minutes on TV, bruh, I'm throwing bombs. I got a bazooka.' I'm trying to kill everything walking, rhetorically, right? That's the performative aspect. It's horrible at a certain level. But it's also trying to make a point. They're used to white guys doing that. White guys can be angry and enraged. I do it: 'What are you so angry for, black man?' So I understand that. But I'm coming at you. And I'm going to do it with high intelligence and words.

Texto completo: Looking back at the 2020s from our vantage point in 2030, the first great event was the complete destruction of Donald Trump's Republican Party. As the former Republican consultant Mike Murphy had noticed, there were roughly 300 state and federal elections during the Trump years and Republicans did horribly in most of them. The 2020 vote was a continuation of that trend. Trump's landslide defeat left him humiliated, and the Republicans lost their Senate majority.
Trump cried fraud and tried to whip up his followers, but they turned their backs. He went from idol to scapegoat in an instant. It seemed they could forgive him everything but losing. Many temporarily retreated from political life, the way evangelical Christians did after the ignominy of the Scopes trial.
President Joe Biden faced an interesting dynamic in his party. The political power was with moderates. The intellectual power was with the left. People of color, whose views were largely more moderate, became the crucial swing faction.
As president, Biden resisted the interest groups that wanted him to address health care first. Instead, he did child and earned-income tax credits, infrastructure, expanded early childhood education, expanded prison reform, and so on - what some writers called "reparations by any other name." He gave regulatory czar Elizabeth Warren a special portfolio to take on Big Tech.
The major events of the decade were cultural, not political. The Trump era had witnessed a crisis of connection at the bottom of society and a crisis of authority at the top. Social repair was the top order of the day once a new president took office.
The first whiff of the cultural restoration was the "Accountability Clubs" that spread across the nation's campuses. College students realized that America stinks at accountability. Either there is no accountability (Wall Street after the financial crisis) or people have their lives destroyed for a "problematic" tweet.
The Accountability Clubs bore the motto "Truth and Mercy." Students wanted to restore a culture in which facts mattered. They were also searching for a way to judge others in a graduated and humane manner, allowing for repentance, forgiveness and restoration. Marshall McLuhan once remarked that "moral indignation is a technique used to endow an idiot with dignity." Suddenly indignation, the keystone emotion of the Trump years, was lame. Empathy made a comeback.
The second cultural trend of the decade was the rise of the urban church. Suburban megachurch attendance fell, because the pastors had disgraced themselves under Trump. But suddenly there was a surge in church plants in places like Brooklyn, Washington, D.C., Chicago and San Francisco, as highly educated people found homes for their spiritual longings.
The churches were liturgically highly charismatic (Bethel music) and highly universalistic and intellectual (Richard Rohr). Their politics were an odd mix - pro-LGBTQ, pro-life, active on climate change, pro-animal rights (one of the signature moral causes of the decade). The religious left gained on the religious right.
At the same time, the racial justice conversation went intimate. America is involved in a multigenerational process of truth and reconciliation. In the teens, the truth-telling had generally revolved around historic events - slavery, lynching, redlining. In the 2020s, a series of writers, artists and directors gave us vivid descriptions of the subtleties of contemporary black life.
The profusion of video streaming networks allowed a new generation of artists to take audiences inside the psychological lives of people of color. These artists realized that structural change would happen when people learned to see one another whole.
The most important cultural change came to be known as the Civic Renaissance. During the first two decades of the century, hundreds of thousands of new civic organizations came into being - healing political divides, fighting homelessness, promoting social mobility and weaving communities. But these organizations were small. They did not grow into the big national chapter-based structures that had repaired America's social fabric a century earlier - the YMCA, the Rotary, the Boy Scouts.
By the 2020s, philanthropists and community builders realized the only way to change culture and weave the social fabric was by creating an AFL-CIO of civil society, with big national voices and large, decentralized national organizations so that people across America had easy and practical pathways to get involved in community revival.
In the 2010s, it seemed like the liberal order was cracking up. In the 2020s, that feeling vanished. The decline of the Chinese economy delegitimized the authoritarian model. It turns out you can't run a centrally controlled economy without a lot of waste, corruption and riot police.
Meanwhile, the American political system began to work better. The GOP re-emerged under Josh Hawley and Marco Rubio as a better version of a working-class party - socially right, economically left. Democrats remained dominant through the decade. Their party's biggest accomplishment was in foreign affairs - the repair of America's alliances and the restoration of global American leadership.
Americans were more collaborative in the 2020s. And the New York Mets won the World Series every single year.

Twin states, different views of climate change

Texto completo: For the Valley News
The side-by-side states look similar on a map, and both have Republican governors. Their weather doesn’t often differ much. But when it comes to the climate crisis, Vermont and New Hampshire could be on different planets.
With the Trump administration and most of the Republican Party denying evidence of an impending climate disaster, the U.S. Climate Alliance set out to provide an alternative for states that take the science seriously.
Governors of New York, California and Oregon announced the formation of the Alliance on June 1, 2017, and Gov. Phil Scott said right away Vermont would join. New Hampshire did nothing.
Not coincidentally, this was the day President Donald Trump announced he would withdraw the United States from the Paris climate agreement that sought to bring “all nations into a common cause” against what scientists warn is an existential threat.
The implications of that commitment are complicated, but their responses to one specific effort — launched by California — show the gulf between Vermont and New Hampshire.
When the Trump administration sought to loosen vehicle emission standards and then moved to bar California from setting its own higher requirements, Vermont joined several states in challenging the move. New Hampshire did not.
Most recently, Gov. Chris Sununu made matters worse by withdrawing from the Transportation and Climate Initiative, known as TCI, because of its proposed gas tax. If Sununu was intending to put his state squarely in the column of climate denial, quitting TCI just about sealed the deal.
And, by the way, TCI — a sort of regional version of the international Paris climate accord focused on greenhouse gas emissions — is no small thing. Members include Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Virginia and the District of Columbia, as well as Vermont. Participating states agree to “work to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, minimize the transportation system’s reliance on high-carbon fuels, promote sustainable growth and address the challenges of vehicle-miles traveled.”
The question remains: Why does Gov. Sununu choose to make New Hampshire an island of climate change denial in a region seriously trying to address the growing crisis?
I see two possible explanations.
In New Hampshire, where “Live Free or Die” now sometimes seems to mean “live as close to tax-free as possible,” avoiding the TCI gas tax could be a winning tactic for a governor seeking reelection. This might be especially true because many low- and middle-income citizens need to drive long distances to work. The truth is nearly any tax other than an income tax, which New Hampshire avoids like disease, weighs most heavily on those with limited incomes.
Also — and more important, perhaps — Sununu’s father, John H. Sununu, President George H.W. Bush’s chief of staff from 1989 to 1991, has been credited with almost single-handedly ending the possibility of a bipartisan approach to climate change, which seemed more plausible in the 1980s than it does now.
In Nathaniel Rich’s Losing Earth: The Decade We Almost Stopped Climate Change, which filled The New York Times Magazine in August 2018, Sununu’s father emerges as a villain who uses the authority of his MIT engineering degrees to persuade President Bush — and most of the GOP — that climate change predictions were based on bad science.
Despite many warnings, such as the Union of Concerned Scientists’ prediction that by 2045 the New Hampshire Seacoast could experience $645 million of residential property damage, Sununu has released an energy plan opposing subsidies for renewable energy. The poisoned apple of climate science denial doesn’t fall far from the tree.

Kamala Harris: Will McConnell Let the Senate Hold a Fair Impeachment Trial?

Texto completo: Today the House of Representatives will vote on whether to impeach President Trump. If it votes yes, sometime early in the new year I will take an oath on the Senate floor to uphold the Constitution, review evidence and follow the facts wherever they lead, regardless of party or ideology. Every one of my colleagues will be required to do the same.
As a former prosecutor, I understand the importance of holding powerful people accountable. I know that every trial requires fairness and truth. Having worked my whole life serving the people, I know that any trial that abandons the pursuit of truth cannot be considered fair or just.
But the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, appears more interested in covering up the president's misconduct than in pursuing truth and fairness. He is already trying to limit the impeachment trial by preventing witnesses from testifying, and he has all but announced a verdict. In doing so, he showed the American people that he has no intention of honoring his oath.
Let's be Gear: Mr. McConnell doesn't want a Senate trial. He wants a Senate cover-up.
Fortunately, Mr. McConnell does not have the power to unilaterally undermine this trial. Every single senator will be empowered with an equal vote on how the trial will proceed. Though in just the past year, Mr. McConnell has used his position to unilaterally block legislation to restore the Voting Rights Act, lower the prices of prescription drugs and address the gun violence epidemic, he cannot wield the same authority in a Senate impeachment trial.
In this trial, senators will be far more than jurors. Every one of us will vote to determine the rules for the trial, decide which witnesses testify and ultimately serve as both court and jury. Each of us will be called on to uphold our oath with every decision we make.
We will all be held accountable by the American people if we refuse to discover the facts relevant to the articles of impeachment.
The Senate Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer, has made a reasonable request to hear from four additional witnesses with firsthand knowledge of the president's misconduct and to review documents that shed light on why the administration initially decided to cut off military aid to Ukraine.
We need to hear from Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, who admitted to Mr. Trump's bribery scheme on live television, and from the former national security adviser, John Bolton, who has been shopping stories about Mr. Trump to book publishers instead of speaking with Congress. Every senator should want to hear from anyone who can speak directly to the president's misconduct related to the articles of impeachment.
Even Richard Nixon allowed the key figures behind the Watergate scandal to speak to Congress, and he eventually turned over incriminating portions of his Oval Office recordings to investigators. But Mr. Trump has stonewalled Congress and inhibited our ability to seek justice by demanding that those closest to the center of the Ukraine scandal stay silent.
Senators must be allowed to subpoena relevant witnesses and submit questions to them directly. The Senate should not vote on any article of impeachment or consider a motion to dismiss the trial until we have reviewed the additional testimony and evidence that Mr. Schumer has requested.
I have never been in a courtroom where the accused can unilaterally block witnesses from testifying or prohibit prosecutors from asking witnesses questions. No court would allow a trial to proceed this way, and neither should any member of the Senate.
Ensuring the integrity of this trial is a solemn responsibility for every senator, with consequences that extend far beyond any one presidency. My colleagues and I have a duty to use our voice and our vote to insist on a fair trial, rooted in the pursuit of truth. We must demonstrate to the American people that in our system of justice all are equal under law, and that there are not two sets of rules, one for Donald Trump and another for everybody else. We must conduct the Senate impeachment trial in a way that is fair and that reflects impartial justice.
History will judge the actions taken by the United States Senate at a time when our Constitution and the rule of law were at stake. I'll be fighting for justice and accountability, and my colleagues should too.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — The United States and Iran exchanged escalating military threats on Friday as President Trump warned that he is “prepared to take whatever action is necessary" if Iran threatens Americans and Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, vowed to exact vengeance for the killing on Trump's order of Iran's most valued general.
Although Trump insisted that he took the action to avoid a war with Iran, the continuing threats further rattled foreign capitals, global markets, and Capitol Hill, where Democrats demanded more information about the strike and Trump's grounds for taking such a provocative and risky move without consulting Congress. Democrats also pressed questions about the attack's timing and whether it was meant to deflect attention from the president's expected impeachment trial this month in the Senate.
Speaking to reporters in a hastily arranged appearance at Mar-a-Lago, his Florida resort, Trump asserted that Major General Qassem Soleimani, who directed Iranian paramilitary forces throughout the Middle East, “was plotting imminent and sinister attacks on American diplomats and military personnel, but we caught him in the act and terminated him."
General Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; Secretary of State Mike Pompeo; and Robert C. O'Brien, the national security adviser, echoed Trump's remarks. But Milley, Pompeo, O'Brien, and other senior administration officials did not describe any new specific threats that were different from what American officials say Soleimani had been orchestrating for years.
In Baghdad, the State Department urged US citizens to leave Iraq immediately, citing “heightened tensions." The US Embassy, which had been under siege by pro-Iranian protesters chanting “Death to America" in recent days, suspended consular operations. “US citizens should not approach the Embassy," the State Department warned on Twitter.
At Fort Bragg, N.C., some 3,500 members of the 82nd Airborne, ordered to the Middle East this week, prepared to deploy to Kuwait.
On Wall Street, the stock market fell as oil prices jumped after the news of the general's death. The price of Brent oil, the international benchmark, surged in the early hours of Hong Kong trading to nearly $70 a barrel — an increase of $3.
The immediate increase in the price of oil was among the largest since an attack on a critical Saudi oil installation in September that temporarily knocked out 5 percent of the world's supply.
In more violence, another airstrike almost exactly 24 hours after the one that targeted Soleimani killed five members of an Iran-backed militia north of Baghdad, an Iraqi security official said. The Iran-backed Popular Mobilization Forces confirmed the strike, saying it hit one of its medical convoys near the stadium in Taji, north of Baghdad. The group said none of its top leaders were killed. A US official speaking on condition of anonymity said the attack was not an American military attack.
Trump said that the killing early Friday of Soleimani, the commander of the Quds Force branch of Iran's Revolutionary Guard, was long overdue. He insisted he did not want a larger fight with Iran.
“We took action last night to stop a war," the president said. “We did not take action to start a war." But he also warned Iran that the American military had “already fully identified" potential targets for further attacks “if Americans anywhere are threatened."
Hours earlier, Khamenei issued his own warning to Trump about Soleimani's death from a missile fired by an American MQ-9 Reaper drone at the general's convoy at Baghdad International Airport.
“His departure to God does not end his path or his mission," Khamenei said in a statement, “but a forceful revenge awaits the criminals who have his blood and the blood of the other martyrs last night on their hands."
Pompeo, an Iran hawk, said a planned attack on Americans had been “imminent" before the strike.
Writing on Twitter earlier in the day, Trump suggested that Soleimani “got caught" preparing to hit American targets.
“General Qassem Soleimani has killed or badly wounded thousands of Americans over an extended period of time, and was plotting to kill many more . . . but got caught!" Trump tweeted. “He was directly and indirectly responsible for the death of millions of people, including the recent large number of PROTESTERS killed in Iran itself."
The strike touched off an immediate debate in Washington, with Republicans hailing the action as a decisive blow against a longtime enemy with American blood on his hands and Democrats expressing concern that the president was risking a new war in the Middle East.
With Congress returning to town after the holidays for a presumed Senate impeachment trial, Trump risked suspicion that he was taking action overseas to distract from his political troubles at home, a la the movie “Wag the Dog."
As a private citizen, Trump repeatedly accused President Barack Obama of preparing to go to war with Iran to bolster his reelection chances in 2012. As president, Trump has questioned his own intelligence agencies and peddled repeated falsehoods, a record that could undermine the administration's credibility on the highly delicate subject.
Democratic leaders complained that Trump acted without consulting or even telling Congress first. The president responded by retweeting a post comparing Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, to the Iranians.
Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, said that a classified briefing was being arranged for all senators next week and that everyone should welcome the demise of Soleimani. “For too long, this evil man operated without constraint and countless innocents have suffered for it," McConnell said on the floor. “Now his terrorist leadership has been ended."
Democrats said Trump was playing a dangerous game that could further involve the United States in Middle East conflict rather than pull out as he has promised. “President Trump came into office saying he wanted to end America's wars in the Middle East, but today we are closer to war with Iran than ever before and the Administration's reckless policy over the last 3 years has brought us to the brink," Senator Chris Van Hollen of Maryland wrote on Twitter.
Soleimani, the driving force behind Iranian-sponsored attacks and operations over two decades around the region including Iraq, Syria, Yemen, and Lebanon, was considered perhaps the second-most powerful figure in Iran.
In an unusual move, the ayatollah attended an emergency meeting of the Supreme National Security Council. “America must know the criminal attack on Soleimani was its worst strategic mistake in the Middle East and that America will not escape the consequences easily," the council said afterward. “As our Supreme Leader said in his message, a harsh revenge awaits the criminals who have the general's blood on their hands. These criminals will face revenge at the right time and place."
Pompeo said in a TV appearance that the United States had intelligence that Soleimani was preparing a specific, new operation to target Americans in the Middle East, but declined to elaborate.
“He was actively plotting in the region to take actions, a big action as he described it, that would have put dozens if not hundreds of American lives at risk," Pompeo said on CNN. “It was imminent."
The decision to hit Soleimani complicates relations with Iraq's government, which has tried to balance itself between the United States and Iran.
A senior Iraqi official said Friday that there was a good chance the Iraqi Parliament would vote to force US troops to leave Iraq.
