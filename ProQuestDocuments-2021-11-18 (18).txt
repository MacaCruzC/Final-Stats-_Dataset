Texto completo: OAKLAND >> Oakland could become the second city in the nation to allow the use of psilocybin mushrooms also known as "magic mushrooms" following in Denver's footsteps.
The City Council on Tuesday will consider approving a resolution barring police from enforcing laws banning the use of "entheogenic" or psychoactive plants, which include psilocybin mushrooms, ayahuasca and peyote.
The proposed resolution stems from a movement at the state level to decriminalize psilocybin mushrooms, which suffered a setback when a measure to accomplish that goal didn't make it to California's 2018 ballot. Activists are gathering signatures now to put a measure on the Oregon state ballot next year to legalize the medical use of psilocybin.
Three of the four council members who make up Oakland's public safety committee voted Tuesday to move the resolution to the full council for a vote. Supporters of the effort packed City Hall, and around 60 people many of them psychiatrists testified to the benefits of entheogenic plants.
"I've seen firsthand how these plants can heal individuals, and I really want to emphasize that these plants can also heal a community," said Gary Kono, a retired surgeon who co-founded Decriminalize Nature Oakland, an activist group leading the effort to legalize entheogenic plants in the city.
Council member Noel Gallo, who brought the resolution forward, said in his proposal that allowing the use of entheogenic plants would remove them from their underground status and "empower communities to share knowledge and continue building an above-ground infrastructure around entheogens."
Oakland, he added in his proposal, "has a unique opportunity to lead by example, and guide the nationwide conversation."
The resolution would not apply to synthetic drugs such as LSD or Ecstasy.
Larry Norris of Decriminalize Nature Oakland said in an interview that the initiatives in Oregon and Denver prompted the group to push for the resolution. It started discussing the proposal in December and pitched it to Gallo earlier this year.
Several members of Decriminalize Nature Oakland told council members of personal "life-changing" experiences that resulted from using the drugs and of how other cultures have used them for centuries to be closer to nature. Little was said at the meeting of people just using them for recreation.
"Our communities have been using natural plant medicines as they are indigenous to communities of color; they've been using them for thousands of years," said Amber Senter, a local cannabis entrepreneur who is also part of Decriminalize Nature Oakland.
Council member Loren Taylor abstained from the vote Tuesday, saying although he recognizes that the drugs can benefit people in certain settings, he is concerned they also can be used unsafely and hopes to see an education effort warning people of the risks.
"It's a matter of how we deploy it and make sure it's not something that becomes a fad with our kids and potentially used in schools," Taylor said, adding he's also worried about people driving under the influence of entheogenic plants.
Oakland police officials at Tuesday's meeting didn't weigh in on the proposal, but noted there have been only 19 cases over the past five years in which they confiscated a substance believed to be psilocybin mushrooms.
Several speakers mentioned a study released by Johns Hopkins University last year that suggested psilocybin could be used to treat depression and anxiety and even help people quit smoking, according to The New York Times. Bestselling author and Berkeley resident Michael Pollan's recent book, "How to Change Your Mind," makes the case that psychedelic drugs can be effective therapy tools, especially for people trying to recover from drug addiction.

Texto completo: The climbing season at Mount Everest may be coming to a close, but the past few weeks have been historic for the world's tallest mountain.
Avid Everest blogger Alan Arnette wrote Thursday that one of the last known teams on the mountain turned around during their summit attempt because of bad weather.
According to the count by Arnette, a Colorado climber who summited Mount Everest on his fourth attempt in 2011 and who keeps track of its climbing seasons, more than 825 climbers and Sherpas reached the summit this year, a record breaking number.
The number of permits from the Nepalese government also broke records this year with 381 issued.
And deaths were at a four-year high, with 11 fatalities, most blamed on a combination of overcrowding, inexperience and poor weather limiting the number of days climbers were able to attempt to summit.
Here's a look back at the recent stories from Mount Everest:
Utah climber dies after reaching Seven Summits
Don Cash, 55, an experienced American climber, was among the first fatalities widely reported in U. S. media from this year's Everest season.
The Sandy, Utah, father collapsed and died last Wednesday as he was descending the summit, likely due to complications from altitude sickness, his family said.
More: He climbed the tallest mountain on each continent, then died as he descended Mount Everest
Cash had just completed his goal of joining the Seven Summits Club, earned when a climber reaches the top of the tallest mountain on each continent.
"The last message he sent to me personally was, 'I'm so blessed to be on the mountain I have read about for 40 years!'" his son, Tanner Cash, told "Today. "
Overcrowding atop Everest
A photo taken the same day Cash died showed what appeared to be a single line of climbers waiting to reach the summit.
Veteran climber Nirmal Purja captured the photo while descending the summit, and it quickly became the poster for the overcrowding issue this season.
"I've seen traffic, but not this crazy," Purja, who has reached the top of Everest four times, told the Washington Post.
Video on social media also appeared to show the packed peaks on the mountain.
Many other experienced climbers began to blame to growing death toll on the increased number of climbers on the mountain.
At 29,035 feet, the air atop Everest has such low oxygen levels that just being in the area near the summit, let alone climbing, proves lethal for those who cannot reach extra oxygen supplies fast enough.
'Every minute counts': Another climber dies on Everest as world's tallest peak overcrowds
Others say that it was the inexperience of many of the climbers on the cliffs this year.
"You have to qualify to do the Ironman," Arnette told The New York Times. "But you don’t have to qualify to climb the highest mountain in the world? What’s wrong with this picture?"
Government officials in Nepal, though, faulted poor weather, which narrowed the window in which reaching the summit was even possible to just a few days.
What's behind Everest's deadly season?: Overcrowding, inexperience and a long line to the top
Tourism officials said earlier this week that the country has no plans to limit the number of permits it issues next year. Nepal, one of the world's poorest countries, charges $11,000 per permit and earned $300 million a year from its climbing industry.
Another American dies
Christopher Kulish, 62, a Boulder, Colorado, attorney, died Monday at a camp after summiting the mountain, his family said.
After he stood atop Everest, Kulish also joined the elusive "Seven Summit Club. "
"He saw his last sunrise from the highest peak on Earth," brother Mark Kulish said in a statement. "He passed away doing what he loved, after returning to the next camp below the peak. "
'Passed away doing what he loved': Second American dies on Mount Everest in crowded year
Kulish's death marked the 11th fatality on the mountain this year.
Mandy Moore reaches Base Camp
"This Is Us" actress Mandy Moore was also among the adventurers around Everest this year.
While she wasn't attempting a summit, Moore completed the impressive feat of hiking to Mount Everest's Base Camp, which sits 17,600 feet above sea level.

"Breathing at altitude, for instance, is not easy," she wrote on social media. "Besides hydration and staying nourished, breathing is THE vital key in the fight against altitude sickness. It’s also a major takeaway that I will be employing back to the real world whether I’m in the midst of a tough workout or a weird day. Mind blown. "

Report shows dramatic improvement in melanoma survival rates in past decade

Texto completo: Fighting cancer was a major focus of the Obama administration but not the Trump one, which has instead launched major initiatives on HIV/AIDS and opioid addiction. But cancer death rates keep steadily declining - especially for melanoma, the deadliest form of skin cancer.
Melanoma deaths have fallen dramatically in the past decade, according to an annual cancer report released Thursday by the National Cancer Institute.
Annual death rates from melanoma declined 8.5 percent among men from 2014 to 2016 and 6.3 percent among women from 2013 to 2016. The improvements are greater among African Americans, who develop melanoma less often but experience more severe varieties.
Much has been written on the cutting-edge, genetically targeted treatments and immunotherapies that cancer researchers are developing. But melanoma is a prime and underappreciated example of how the therapies are working. Over the past decade, new therapies known as immune checkpoint inhibitors have dramatically improved advanced-melanoma survival rates by revving up the body's immune system to attack tumor tissue.
Former president Jimmy Carter had just such an experience. After announcing in August 2015 that his melanoma had spread to his liver and brain, Carter, then 91, underwent radiation followed by immunotherapy. Three months later, his tumors were gone.
"We know new therapies - which have only been around since the early part of this decade - improved the outlook for those with advanced melanoma," Leonard Lichtenfeld, interim chief medical officer for the American Cancer Society, wrote in a blog post. "However, I for one - and I suspect many others, even experts in the field - didn't realize the extent of the impact those treatments have had on this dread disease."
The annual cancer report - which provides a broad update on diagnosis and death rates for the most common cancers in the United States - contains mostly good news but also some sobering statistics.
Death rates declined among men, women and children from 1999 to 2016. Rates of new cancers among men decreased from 2008 to 2015 (after increasing in the previous decade), while remaining stable among women in the same period. The data showed men between ages 20 and 49 develop cancer less often than women in the same age range. But that is chiefly because the most common female cancer - breast cancer - is frequently found in younger women.
Cancers associated with smoking - think lung, bladder and larynx - are continuing to decline. But cancers associated with excess weight and inactivity - including uterine, postmenopausal breast and colorectal - are still increasing.
"We are encouraged by the fact that this year's report continues to show declining cancer mortality for men, women, and children, as well as other indicators of progress," said Betsy Kohler, executive director of the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries, in a news release put out by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Kohler's helped with the report.
Other than calling for more pediatric cancer funding in his State of the Union address this year, President Trump has not often talked about the disease. He was criticized for suggesting, while speaking at a National Republican Congressional Committee fundraiser, that wind turbines cause cancer.
"If you have a windmill anywhere near your house, congratulations, your house just went down 75 percent in value" Trump said. "And they say the noise causes cancer."
There has been speculation that Joe Biden may take the fight against cancer to the forefront of his Democratic presidential campaign. Through his Biden Cancer Initiative, the former vice president has been leading a focused effort to find cancer cures. He launched the push in 2015 as the Obama White House's "Cancer Moonshot."
Biden, who lost his son Beau to brain cancer four years ago, has been connecting with voters over family tragedies, the New York Times' politics reporter Katie Glueck has written. "While political candidates often try to project sympathy - Bill Clinton was especially known for wearing his heart on his sleeve - some Democrats said they felt a bond with Mr. Biden that transcended traditional political factors: They consider him to be a singularly experienced candidate when it comes to endurance and empathy," she wrote.
Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), another 2020 presidential candidate, frequently mentions her mother's work as a cancer researcher. She brought it up during an MSNBC town hall on Tuesday while talking about abortion rights.
"It's personal to me," Harris said. "My mother was a breast cancer researcher - she was one of the very few women of color doing that work - and I remember her coming home and talking about how we as a society have diminished women's health-care issues."

Local climber glad he beat the crowds at Everest

Texto completo: Last week’s Associated Press photograph of Mount Everest shows a long line of hundreds of climbers in brightly colored gear inching their way to the peak as if they were waiting in line for Space Mountain at Disney World.
"How do they get down? There’s an elevator, right?" quips Joel Schauer, 58, of Hawthorn Woods. Schauer didn’t have to share his Everest moment with hundreds of fellow climbers when he scaled the peak in 2016. He and a guide left the South Col at 25,938 feet at 7 p.m. and arrived at the summit at 6:45 a.m. by themselves.
"There were two people who turned around in front of me when I was making it to the top," Schauer remembers.
Exhausted after the last 12-hour climb, his zipper frozen by the condensation from his breathing mask in the below-zero temperatures, and with a dwindling oxygen supply at 29,029 feet, Schauer didn’t even remove his face mask for the photo of him displaying his "On The Top: Fairchild Automotive" flag from his Lake Zurich business.
"This is nice," Schauer remembers thinking during the hour he spent on top of the world before others arrived and safety became his top concern. "How long can I live here? Look around, enjoy it and get down."
More than 300 people have died climbing Everest since 1953, when Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay became the first people to reach the top. So far this month, at least 11 climbers have died while scaling the world’s tallest mountain, the latest a 62-year-old Colorado attorney who had reached the peak and was starting his descent, which can be just as dangerous.
"On the way down, I was trying to suck oxygen, and there wasn’t enough there," remembers Schauer. At one point he slipped and found himself dangling from a rope. "I’m looking out at the Himalayas upside-down," he says. He somehow managed to get a grip with the crampons on his boots digging into the ice, pulled himself up and made it safely back to base camp.
A climber at crowded Everest last week told CNN about having to step over dead bodies on the path. Schauer, whose first Everest attempt in 2014 was canceled after an avalanche killed 16 Sherpas, says he didn’t see any bodies during his successful climb two years later. Some critics have blamed the deaths during this climbing season, which ended this week, on the growing number of climbers. Many are unprepared, and the crowding is caused by an increase in the number of companies leading the expeditions.
"Is it hubris? Might be. Is it bad preparation? Might be. Is it the line? Might be," Schauer says, adding that changing the protocol to call for more oxygen for the trip down from the summit might help. A story in The New York Times on Wednesday says Nepalese officials are considering changes that would bar inexperienced climbers and make it more difficult to get a permit.
Whether going up or down, the process is slow and tedious and climbers have to maneuver past each other. "You have to do the Everest dance," Schauer says, describing the process of moving along the guide rope. "You unclip, move, reclip, move. You’re clipping and unclipping 10,000 times."
And when you are exhausted, dealing with the altitude, short on air, and numb from the cold, it’s difficult to improvise.
"It’s really hard to get off that line. There’s nowhere to go," Schauer says. "You’re limited to the slowest person in line."
Schauer and his wife, Kathy, parents of three grown children, Jennifer, Melissa and Jake, became grandparents a week ago with the birth of Addison Grace to Jake and Elizabeth Schauer. Earlier in the year, Joel Schauer reached another milestone when he climbed to the top of Aconcagua in Argentina, making him just the 48th person to climb the highest mountains in all seven continents and ski to both the North and South poles.
The lessons he learns from climbing about building strong teams, planning well and taking "intelligent risks" help him run his business, Schauer says. Everest will always be one of his major accomplishments, but he doesn’t see the need to climb it again. His daughter Jennifer is going to run a not-for-profit for abused girls in Kathmandu, the Nepal city where most Everest climbers embark on their adventure. But Schauer says, "you can climb an equally beautiful mountain without so many people on it."
Considering all his world-famous climbs, ask him about what he is most proud of, and Schauer breaks into a big smile.
"That’s easy," Schauer says. "My granddaughter."

HERE'S HOW TO FIX THE WELFARE STATE A SOCIAL ENTREPRENEUR SHOWS THE WAY: EMBED EMPOWERED CLIENTS IN COMMUNITY

Texto completo: Ella is a British woman who grew up in a broken home and was abused by her stepdad. Her eldest son got thrown out of school and ended up sitting around the house drinking. By the time her daughter was 16, she was pregnant and had an eating disorder. Ella had never had a real job. Life was a series of endless crises - temper tantrums, broken washing machines, her son banging his head against the walls.
Caseworker after caseworker was brought in to provide slivers of help. An astonishing 73 professionals spread across 20 different agencies and departments got involved. Nobody had ever sat down with them to devise a comprehensive way forward.
In her mind-shifting book, "Radical Help," British social entrepreneur Hilary Cottam tracks how one of the social workers in Ella's case spent his days. Roughly 74% of his time was spent on administrative matters - recording data, making referrals to other agencies and meeting with other agencies. Only 14% actually was spent with the family he was meant to serve. And that face-to-face time was mostly checking off boxes on forms.
The administrative system around Ella and her family costs roughly U.S. $320,000 per year.
Ms. Cottam asked the government workers involved in Ella's case if they could recall a time when they'd transformed a family so it no longer needed government help. They couldn't think of one.
I met Ms. Cottam in London last week and she made the point that welfare systems are often designed to manage needs but not to build capabilities so that families can stand on their own. Moreover, most Western systems were not designed to confront the kind of poverty prevalent today.
When these systems were put in place in the 1950s and '60s, unemployment usually was a temporary thing that happened between the time you got laid off from a big employer and hired by a new one. Now, economic insecurity is often a permanent state, as people patch together jobs to make ends meet. Health issues for people in the welfare system are often chronic - obesity, diabetes, many forms of mental illness.
Our legacy welfare structures are ill-suited to today's poverty.
Ms. Cottam has been helping local authorities across Britain build new welfare programs that shift power to the former "recipients" of services. The programs ask: What sort of trajectory would you like to be on? Then the programs build social networks around the families to help them achieve their goals.
For example, Ella was asked if she would like to lead a "life team" that would help her family turn around. She agreed. She was given the power to select eight people from across agencies. She chose people from social work, the housing authority and the police force.
Members of the team spent 80% of their time with the family and only 20% on administration. Ella and the team worked together to stabilize her most immediate issue - negotiating away eviction notices. Then the team worked to improve inter-family dynamics so there wasn't so much violence and screaming.
After a family is stable, the team and family work on building skills and telling stories of success. By 18 months, many of the families involved in the Life Team program no longer need the team. Ella got her first office job and assumed more responsibility for her family. Her kids were back in mainstream schooling.
In the old welfare model, social workers are detached professionals and overwhelmed, bound by bureaucratic rules and often slipping into emotional permafrost. At Life Team, it's about relational accompaniment, giving social workers the discretion to do what they think is best.
Ms. Cottam has designed other programs with a similar collaborative ethos. Backr takes people detached from the labor force and helps them join social networks where they can connect one another to job openings and develop skills. Circles brings together lonely seniors into groups that are part social club, part concierge service and part self-help cooperative. Wellogram is a similar program for the chronically ill.
Basically, Ms. Cottam's programs create villages within the welfare state designed around relational networks. People tend to have better outcomes when they are held accountable by a network of peers. Three-quarters of the smokers in Wellogram successfully quit, 44 percent lowered their blood pressure, 64 percent started work or went back to school.
The old legacy welfare programs were designed for people enmeshed in thick communities but who had suffered a temporary setback. Today, many people lack precisely that web of thick relationships. The welfare state of the future has to build the social structures that people need to thrive. This is one way government can build community.

Texto completo: As news of Bill Buckner’s death spread Monday, reports chronicled his impressive 2,715 career hits — and revisited the error that would come to overshadow his accomplishments.
It was 1986, Game 6 of the World Series. Buckner, then playing for the Boston Red Sox after years as a Chicago Cub, let a ball roll through his legs, allowing the Mets to score and go on to win the series.
Yes, the error hit hard in a town that had not won a World Series since 1918. But the response was far more tragic than the error: Buckner received death threats and ultimately had to move his family out of Massachusetts.
Today, with the ease of the internet and the sting of social media, it likely would have been worse. To those who don’t understand the fervor surrounding professional sports — who find the culture at times distasteful — the Buckner incident goes a long way toward illustrating why.
In this country, we are too quick to turn athletes into heroes — and too quick to turn away from them when their talents, or bodies, fail them. And too often, we are just as fickle with people in other professions and even with ourselves.
We all make mistakes in our professional lives. And we all dread making one that will define the careers we work so hard to build.
As the Daily Herald’s own sports columnist Barry Rozner pointed out, Buckner finished his career with 2,715 hits, 498 doubles, 1,208 RBI and only 453 strikeouts in 10,000 plate appearances. In a perfect world, those are the numbers that should shape his legacy, rather than a single error.
At a news conference years after the World Series play, Buckner called the spotlight on his error "the ugly part of sports," The New York Times reported. "I don’t think that in society in general that’s the way we should operate," he said at the time. "What are you teaching kids? Not to try because if you don’t succeed, then you’re going to be buried, so don’t try?"
It’s a fair and important question, one given added emphasis as we glance over the pictures of high school graduates that have filled this newspaper’s pages and Facebook feeds in recent days.
Those graduates will venture out into the world. Some will start work after tossing their caps into the air. Others will head off to college. A select few will try their luck in professional sports.
Every one of them will make mistakes.
A verbal beating like the one Buckner took should never discourage them from chasing their dreams, but it should make them think twice before publicly trashing a colleague — or a stranger — for a mistake.
And they should take notes on how Buckner moved on from his. He didn’t pass blame. He didn’t give up. He soldiered on with grace.
Ultimately, that is the lesson we can all draw on, whatever our station or profession.

New York Times runs 'distracted boyfriend' meme on front page of Business section

Resumen: It's a new frontier for journalism and meme culture: the New York Times runs the "distracted boyfriend" meme on the front of its Business section.

Texto completo: Thanks to the New York Times' Business section, the distracted boyfriend meme has made it in print.
The Business section used the meme on its Wednesday front page to explain Fiat Chrysler's possible merger with French automaker Renault.
Fiat Chrysler Automobiles outlined a detailed plan Monday to merge with Renault, which responded "with interest. "
If the merger is approved, Nissan — currently an ally of Renault — runs the risk of turning into a rival due to its presence in the United States — where it competes in sales with Chrysler, according to the New York Times.
The meme portrays Nissan as a jilted girlfriend, Fiat Chrysler as a new girl passing on the street and Renault as the "distracted boyfriend. " (The article's online equivalent uses an image of a Renault car on the streets of Italy. )
The meme has also been labeled the "disloyal man. " It has been used to make jokes about the solar eclipse, Star Wars, and, last year, was used in a controversial Swedish recruiting advertisement.
Previous notable memes in print have been accidents, such as when a prominent Mexican newspaper ran a falsified announcement about a new Pokémon game in its print edition last year. To see a newspaper of record publish one in print might bode well for fully integrating meme culture into traditional media.

Christina Ryan Claypool: Suicide: All the Reasons Why Not

Texto completo: “Why” is the question we are haunted by when someone we love takes their life. Netflix picked up on this quandary and created the series, “13 Reasons Why,” about a teenage girl’s decision to complete suicide. She leaves her tragic story behind on cassette tapes implicating others for her fatal action. The teen drama was released on March 31, 2017, and has been renewed for its third season to air sometime later this year.
When this controversial show was originally broadcast, all kinds of folks weighed in. I didn’t. It was too close to home. I suppose I’m a reluctant expert, because in my youth I almost died by suicide.
Still, it seems important to speak up now, because according to a recent Forbes article by Dr. Robert Glatter, “…[a] study from Nationwide Children’s Hospital noted that from 1999-2014 the suicide rate increased three-fold among girls between the ages of 10-14.” In addition, “Suicide is the second most common cause of death in the U.S. among youths between the ages of 10-19….”
Within the faith community, Pastor Rick Warren, the well-known author of the New York Times No. 1 best-seller, “The Purpose Driven Life: What on Earth am I Here For?” and his wife, Kay, have stepped to the forefront in the battle for mental health awareness. Since, Matthew Warren, their 27-year-old son’s highly-publicized suicide six years ago, they have been champions for the cause raising awareness for those silently suffering with a mental health issue.
If you’ve never struggled with any form of clinical depression, bipolar disorder, or even crushing anxiety, you probably don’t understand how an afflicted person can’t simply will themselves out of their hopeless mindset. Depression, which is often a precursor to suicide, is different than being sad, disappointed, or experiencing an occasional down day. Instead when depression accompanied by suicidal ideation is unrelenting and untreated, it’s rather like having terminal cancer and being in so much agony nothing alleviates the pain.
Sadly, www.mentalhealthamerica.net reports, “44,000 Americans die by suicide each year…[and] There is one death by suicide for every 25 attempts.” Addiction increases the risk, “Individuals with substance abuse disorders are six times more likely to complete suicide….”( www.verywellmind.com )
Since Netflix is preparing a third season of the graphic and exploitive “13 Reasons Why,” parents of teens should be alarmed, because some experts consider the program to be extremely harmful. It’s not only, “13 Reasons Why,” but reading books or viewing movies like, “Breathe” or “Me Before You,” which glamourize and promote physician-assisted suicide can influence individuals of any age to falsely decide a mental health or personal crisis can only be solved by terminating their existence.
If someone is contemplating suicide, I would like to offer you some reasons why not. Beginning with the fact, the people who love you will change, but not for the better. Most likely, they will never stop wondering what they could have done to make you stay.
Those left behind will probably blame themselves and be filled with regrets. A counselor will shake his or her head sadly confirming no one is to blame, but deep inside many loved ones will continue to be tormented by “what might have been.” I know this firsthand, because I lost someone I loved more than my own life to suicide.
Don’t embrace the lie that you are a burden, and suicide will free those you love. Instead you will create an agonizing pain for family and friends - a heartache so unbearable they could lose all hope for tomorrow. After all, statistics reveal those who lose a loved one to suicide, can become vulnerable to taking their own life.
Stay alive for the people you care about, even in the midst of the depression and the darkness. Reach out and get the help you need, because with professional treatment you can recover. My life is a testimony that with God’s grace you can live one day at a time. You will see the light again. Hope will return and one day you will remember you are on this Earth for a purpose.
If you need help please call the 24 hour Crisis Hotline in Shelby, Miami, or Darke counties at 1 (800) 351-7347, or in Allen, Auglaize, or Hardin counties at 1 (800) 567-4673, or the National Suicide Prevention Hotline at 1-800-273-8255, or chat online at https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/. Whatever you do, don’t give up.

Adequate public investment would be best gift to Class of '19

Texto completo: Around the turn of the last century, the steel magnate Andrew Carnegie paid to build 1,689 libraries across the United States. Many are still in use, celebrated as monumental works of philanthropy.
They should be seen as monuments to the failure of public policy. The United States could have built a lot more libraries by taxing the incomes of Carnegie and his fellow Gilded Age plutocrats but, at the turn of the last century, there was no federal income tax.
A new generation of plutocrats has amassed great fortunes, in part because the federal government has minimized the burden of taxation. Americans once again are reduced to applauding acts of philanthropy necessitated by failures of policy.
Robert Smith, a wealthy financier, announced during recent graduation ceremonies at Morehouse College that he would repay the student loans taken by the 396 men in this year's graduating class. The promise, which may cost Mr. Smith up to $40 million, was an act of generosity gratefully received by the new graduates of the historically black, all-male Atlanta college.
But their gratitude underscores the reality that hundreds of thousands of other members of the class of 2019 will be carrying unrelieved burdens of debt as they begin their adult lives. On average, recipients of bachelor's degrees in 2016 left school owing about $30,301, according to the most recent federal data. Parents, on average, incurred another $33,291 in debt.
The substitution of philanthropy for public policy is most glaring in the realm of health care, where it has become appallingly common for Americans to beg friends and strangers for the money necessary to pay for treatment. The fund-raising website GoFundMe estimates that it hosts about 250,000 fund-raisers for medical expenses each year.
The same dynamic is at work in higher education. Since 2001, a handful of elite institutions led by Princeton University have committed to tap their endowments to provide funding for students to graduate without loans. Last year, Michael Bloomberg pledged $1.8 billion to Johns Hopkins to reduce the reliance of Hopkins students on borrowed money. But most American colleges, including Morehouse, lack the resources to make such a commitment.
A number of the Democratic candidates for president have proposed large increases in federal funding for higher education to offset the rise of tuition costs and the decline of state funding.
The problem facing policymakers is not merely a lack of will, but also a lack of money. The federal government collected 16.5 percent of the nation's economic output last year — well below the 17.4 percent average federal share over the last half century. The primary reason for the shortfall, of course, is the steady reduction of income taxation. No one has benefited more from that trend than financiers like Morehouse College's 2019 graduation speaker.
Mr. Smith co-founded the private equity firm Vista Equity Partners, which invests in software companies, and he has amassed his fortune thanks in part to a provision of federal tax law known as the "carried interest loophole" — a provision he has publicly supported.
The loophole is projected to cost the government about $15.6 billion in lost revenue between 2016 and 2025. President Trump promised to close it during the 2016 campaign, and he promised to close it as part of his 2017 tax bill. But he did not keep that promise. Instead, the White House and congressional Republicans honored the wishes of the finance industry.
Closing that loophole would be a much better graduation present for the class of 2019.

Trump's war on official math muddies waters in policy debate

Texto completo: Don't like the numbers? Invent new numbers instead.Or make it harder to collect trustworthy numbers next time.
Or just put the squeeze on the number crunchers themselves.
Slowly but surely, the Trump administration has been chipping away at the independence and integrity of our federal statistical agencies, whose data is critical to keeping our democracy functioning and our economy healthy. So far as we know, the administration still hasn't managed to pierce the citadel of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (the independent agency that releases jobs and inflation numbers) or Bureau of Economic Analysis (the independent agency that tabulates gross domestic product). But around the edges, it's trying to compromise lots of other official government data.
Last week, The New York Times reported that the Environmental Protection Agency plans to massage the model it uses to determine how many people die of pollution. The goal is to make the rollback of the Obama-era Clean Power Plan look significantly less deadly than the current models suggest. This is also part of a broader administrative effort to downgrade official estimates of environmental harm resulting from the administration's deregulatory agenda.
It's reminiscent of another proposal the administration made this month, relating to how we measure poverty. That's also a technical, boring-sounding, deep-in-the-weeds change that most of the public won't notice.
At least, not at first.
But over time, the change would reduce the number of Americans officially counted as poor - not because they've started earning more money but because this technical, boring-sounding change would redraw the line for who is in or out of poverty.
If you're a right-wing politician, this change would be a double win. It allows you to claim your policies have lifted families out of poverty, even if they're still struggling. It's also a backdoor way to slash spending on the safety net.
That's because the poverty threshold is used to determine eligibility for lots of safety-net services, meaning those newly defined as not-poor would also become newly defined as not-eligible for food stamps, Medicare's Part D Low-Income Subsidy program and other benefits. After 10 years, for instance, more than 300,000 children would lose comprehensive coverage through Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program, according to an estimate from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
When directly manipulating official government measures isn't an option, the administration can also mess with the data-collection process.
That's precisely what's behind the Commerce Department's last-minute decision to jam a citizenship question into the 2020 Census, the constitutionally mandated enumeration of all "persons" (not just citizens) in the United States.
Immigrant and ethnic minority populations in this country already have high levels of distrust of government, thanks to xenophobic rhetoric and actions by President Trump (including, at one point, a proposed Muslim registry). Now just imagine what happens if the government suddenly demands that every household in America report the citizenship status of every occupant.
Significant population undercounts and otherwise inaccurate data can be expected to result, and the consequences of these distortions would be far-reaching.
The Supreme Court will soon decide whether the administration's plans can proceed; three lower courts have blocked the question, on the grounds that the administration's actions violate administrative law or the Constitution.
Finally, there's the Economic Research Service, the independent statistical agency housed within the Agriculture Department. Its researchers compile and analyze data related to crops, yes, but also poverty, food stamps, trade and climate change, among other politically sensitive issues. And right now these economists and statisticians are quitting in droves. That's because the Trump administration abruptly decided to relocate hundreds of positions. Workers were told that if they want to keep their jobs, they have until the end of September to move their families to ... a still as-yet-unnamed new city.
The relocation is, ostensibly, to save money. But it sure seems like a backdoor purge of an independent agency that has produced analyses inconvenient to the administration, including on the harms caused by Trump's trade wars and how little the 2017 GOP tax overhaul has helped small farmers.
Presumably the Trump administration has calculated that all this will serve its near-term political interests. In the long term, however, sowing distrust in government data only reduces the ability of policymakers, businesses and voters to make informed decisions.
Of course, maybe that was the goal all along.

Texto completo: It's been a busy time for High Country News staff all around the West. Over in our Paonia office, Associate Photo Editor Luna Anna Archey's new puppy, Rhubarb, has successfully charmed most of the staff since she arrived as a tiny fur ball in April. A rescue of uncertain breeding but undeniable cuteness, Ruby is growing fast. She's a welcome addition to the HCN pack. In early May, the Gunnison satellite office staff celebrated the birthday of Editor-in-Chief Brian Calvert, who turned [REDACTED] years old.
On May 7, Contributing Editor Graham Lee Brewer led a cultural competency and ethics training workshop for reporting in Indian Country with the staff of The New York Times' national desk. A few weeks earlier, Brewer led a similar workshop with the Mountain West News Bureau. The Native American Journalists Association sponsored both events. Meanwhile, Julian Brave NoiseCat's February 2018 story "A tale of two housing crises, rural and urban" was a finalist for the prestigious Livingston Award for excellence in local journalism. The award honors standout work by journalists under the age of 35.
We have a few pieces of sad news to share from the wider HCN community. James Bishop Jr., an author, periodic contributor and conservationist, died April 23 at the age of 82. Bishop spent his early life as an editor at Newsweek magazine and later worked as an energy official in President Jimmy Carter's White House. His true calling, though, was as a writer about, and advocate for, the American Southwest. One of his books compiled myths and legends from the region, while another detailed the life of another desert lover, Edward Abbey. In this publication, his dispatches from Arizona included literary essays and reporting on pollution and development. While he often bemoaned the haze hanging over the Grand Canyon or the filling of Lake Powell, Bishop continued working through the end of his life, according to those who knew him. "He never lost hope," wrote his friend Lorena Williams.
We also want to honor the memory of longtime readers Allan and Armella Benton. A lifelong environmentalist, Allan died in August 2011 at the age of 84, while Armella passed away two years later. She was also 84. Allan and Armella's daughter, Ruth, made a major donation to the magazine in their memory last fall. We at HCN want to " thank the Benton family for sticking with us all these years. Finally, a small correction is in order from our Outdoor Recreation and Travel issue (HCN 5/13/19). A caption mistakenly referenced Olympia National Park. It is Olympic. And in the Heard Around the West photo from the same issue, the caption reads "Colorado." Some astute readers have pointed out that the license plate pictured is from Montana. We want to clarify that it was seen and sent by a reader in Silverton, Colorado. We regret the errors.

Marc Thiessen: Trump’s Iran sanctions are working

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — President Trump’s Iran policy appears to be careening between diplomacy and belligerence. One day Trump tweets, “I’m sure that Iran will want to talk soon.” The next he warns that “if Iran wants to fight, that will be the official end of Iran.” Confused? Well, there is a method to the madness.
The Trump administration understands that Iran doesn’t want war because Iran knows it will lose. That’s why Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei made clear via a government Twitter account “no war is to happen.”
Trump’s goal is not to start a war. His administration has three objectives: First, restore deterrence and contain Iran’s expansionism across the Middle East. Second, roll back Iran’s gains and force it back within its borders. And third, give Iran’s leaders a clear choice: They can come to the negotiating table and give up their nuclear and missile ambitions — or their regime can implode, just like the Soviet Union.
When Trump came into office, Iran was on the march across the Middle East — in Syria, Lebanon, Iraq and Yemen — thanks in part to the massive infusions of cash it received from sanctions relief under President Barack Obama’s Iran deal. Trump did not simply restore sanctions imposed before the deal; he ramped them up to unprecedented levels. The sanctions have already “wiped $10 billion from Iranian revenue since November,” The Washington Post reported, citing administration officials.
This month, the administration tightened the screws even further, eliminating waivers for eight countries that had previously been allowed to continue importing Iranian oil. The goal, according to American officials, is to reduce Iranian oil exports to “zero.” It’s working. Bloomberg News reports that “Iran’s oil shipments tumbled this month after the U.S. ended sanctions waivers. … So far, not a single ship has been seen leaving Iran’s oil terminals for foreign ports.”
The new sanctions are forcing Tehran to cut funds to its terrorist proxies. According to The Post, “Iran’s ability to finance allies such as Hezbollah has been curtailed,” while in Lebanon, The New York Times reports, “Syrian militiamen paid by Iran have seen their salaries slashed.” On Tuesday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told Congress that “Iran’s proposed defense budget has been reduced by 25 percent and the [Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps’] proposed budget by about 10 percent.”
Iran is obviously unhappy with this, and U.S. intelligence saw signs that Iran was preparing to respond with attacks on Americans using terrorist proxies — just as they did in the 1983 Beirut Marine barracks bombing and the 1996 Khobar Towers bombing in Saudi Arabia, and by supplying Shiite militias in Iraq with armor-penetrating roadside bombs that killed hundreds of American soldiers.
So the Trump administration delivered a clear message that America will hold Iran directly responsible for any attacks on Americans, even if they are carried out by surrogates — and offered a show of force to back those threats — providing clarity that makes it less likely Iranian leaders will miscalculate.
Sanctions are inflicting major pain. But if the goal is to roll back Iran’s expansionism, then sanctions alone are not enough. We must also aggressively confront Iran throughout the region, building up our allies inflicting defeats on Iran in critical theaters, just as President Ronald Reagan did to the Soviets. A major drawdown of U.S. forces in Syria is incompatible with a “maximum pressure” approach.
Will Iranian leaders come to the table? Far less draconian sanctions brought Iran to the negotiating table under Obama. But Trump has rightly paired tougher sanctions with tougher demands. Pompeo has laid out 12 requirements for a deal with Iran — including an end to support for Middle East terrorist groups and a complete withdrawal from Syria — that Iran is unlikely to meet.
If they don’t come to the table, then what is our strategy? Does Trump really want to bring about the collapse of the Iranian regime? It’s not clear. If he does, then, as my American Enterprise Institute colleague Frederick W. Kagan points out, this task may be even harder than it was with the Soviet Union. As North Korea has shown, tyrannical regimes can survive even crippling sanctions. Certainly, the world will be better if Iran is focused on survival rather than expansion and terror. But it will take more than sanctions to leave the Iranian regime on the ash heap of history. That requires a strategy.

Prominent professor warned Harvard of sex harassment threat to grad students

Texto completo: As Harvard University grapples with its failure to address decades of sexual misconduct by a former professor, some faculty and graduate students say they have been pressing for at least a year for greater urgency in changing a culture of tolerating “open secrets" on campus.
In particular, they have raised alarms and staged protests about the problems faced by graduate students at the hands of the powerful professors who are supposed to be their mentors.
One professor a full year ago said he was no longer comfortable staying silent, given his own concerns and those he was hearing privately from colleagues.
“We exhort students and other victims of harassment to come forward and speak up," Stephen Blyth, a statistics professor and the former head of Harvard's multibillion-dollar endowment, wrote in a May 2018 letter to then-president Drew Gilpin Faust. Yet Harvard has a history of failing to act, Blyth said: “Victims and witnesses need to have confidence that perpetrators will, when appropriate, be removed from the university."
A copy of the letter was obtained by the Globe in the wake of recent sanctions against Jorge Dominguez, a retired Harvard government professor who was found to have engaged in “unwelcome sexual conduct" with female students and junior faculty over four decades.
The Blyth letter was shared last year with other top Harvard officials, including president Lawrence Bacow after he took over in July, a university spokesman confirmed.
Blyth said he stands by his letter. “We have an urgent collective responsibility to tackle harassment at Harvard robustly and promptly, in order to deserve the full trust of our students," he said in a statement.
Meanwhile, graduate students at Harvard, who are in a labor dispute with the university, have been protesting for months, demanding greater protections against harassment as part of their negotiated contract.
Earlier this month, Harvard acknowledged — after a yearlong investigation — its findings against Dominguez, the retired professor and onetime vice provost. The school took the rare step of stripping him of the privileges granted to retired faculty and barred him from campus.
At the same time, Bacow agreed to an external review of the university's policies. The probe is meant to examine why alleged victims may be reluctant to report misconduct, and what barriers may prevent Harvard from effectively responding to complaints.
Harvard spokesman Jonathan Swain confirmed that Faust, Bacow, and other top Harvard officials had seen Blyth's warning letter. But he said Harvard has been tackling harassment on a number of fronts since 2015 and making vigorous changes in its practices, outreach, and training for at least the past two years.
“As President Bacow has said, the university's highest priority is providing a welcoming, healthy and safe community where all students, faculty, and staff can do their best work," Swain said in a statement. This includes “ensuring Harvard is an environment where individuals are empowered to come forward when misconduct occurs."
For graduate students, reporting misconduct by a professor can be particularly fraught. Professors and department chairs guide their research and apply for grants that can help fund their pay. They also provide important recommendations for future positions, and help students establish contacts that can propel their careers.
At Harvard, that power imbalance can be magnified even further: Professors are often superstars in their fields, known worldwide and teaching at one of the country's premier institutions, graduate students said.
“The power relationships in academia are difficult. Your supervisor has control over your whole career," said Ege Yumusak, a second-year graduate student in philosophy and a member of the graduate student worker union. “Harvard is a place where there are many powerful people."
Blyth, in his letter, said the bravery required for a doctoral student to complain about a top professor rivals what Hollywood actors had to summon in the face of Harvey Weinstein's alleged sexual harassment.
Even younger professors, on whom students might lean for help if they are being mistreated, are often reticent to rock the boat, the letter said. “I encountered professors who would not speak on the record for fear of retribution or disruption to their own career."
Harvard is moving ahead in earnest, said Swain, the school spokesman.
He noted that in March of 2018, Faust had asked a committee that oversees Harvard's gender and sexual discrimination matters to look into harassment by faculty members, two months before the Blyth letter was written.
Harvard saw a 56 percent increase in reports of sexual or gender-based harassment in 2018 — from 266 incidents to 416, and the largest portion identified involve faculty or staff. Harvard officials attribute the rise in reports to more training and raising awareness among students, faculty, and staff.
Since 2017, under newly appointed Title IX officer Nicole Merhill, Harvard has offered students more ways to file complaints, officials say. Students can bring to her office reports of sexual harassment or assault by students or faculty members. Sometimes alleged victims don't want to file formal complaints and are informed of other options, officials say.
Harvard also has a formal complaint process handled by its Office of Dispute Resolution, which investigates allegations.
But Harvard officials would not say whether the spike in incident reports has led to more disciplinary actions against faculty or staff for violations. Sanctions against faculty are left up to each individual school on the campus and punishment for bad behavior can vary.
Recent publicized sexual harassment cases show that Harvard has not been good at policing itself, graduate students said.
“It's a systemic problem that needs a systemic solution," said Vail Kohnert-Yount, a Harvard Law School student and a founder of the Pipeline Parity Project, fighting to end sexual harassment and discrimination in the legal profession. She said a university wide examination is sorely needed and long overdue.
Aside from the Dominguez case, Harvard also is investigating complaints of sexual harassment by other professors. For instance, allegations have been made against Roland Fryer, a high-profile economist. Fryer is alleged to have discussed sex at work, sexualized female workers, and created a demeaning workplace at his research lab going back several years, according to an attorney representing a lab worker who filed a complaint.
In a letter to the editor of The New York Times, Fryer apologized for making “bad jokes," but denied retaliating against employees or fostering an environment where women felt alienated.
Fryer's attorney said recently the professor is still waiting for a ruling from Harvard.
The problem of graduate student sexual harassment has been gaining greater attention on campuses across the country and goes far beyond Harvard Yard.
At Dartmouth College, three former psychology professors have been accused of sexual assault and harassment in a high-profile case. Earlier this year, a Michigan State University professor was alleged to have exchanged sexual favors for academic guidance to graduate students dating back to 2002. And last month, Boston University fired a well-known geologist over allegations that he harassed two former graduate students during research trips to Antarctica. The geologist has denied the allegations.
Terry Karl, an professor emeritus at Stanford University who first raised the alarm on Dominguez in the early 1980s when she was a young professor at Harvard, said the university must confront what she calls institutional failings in dealing with faculty such as Dominguez.
The external review could be a step in the right direction, she said, and “could be a turning point and an example for all universities or one more effort to stonewall, protect faculty, at all costs and shove abuse of power under the rug."

Deutsche Bank Leaders, Facing Angry Shareholders, Survive Vote

Texto completo: FRANKFURT -- Deutsche Bank shareholders had plenty of reasons to be unhappy as they converged in a Frankfurt concert hall Thursday for the troubled lender's annual meeting.
A record low share price. An aborted megamerger with crosstown rival Commerzbank. Money-laundering scandals. New revelations about the bank's relationship with Donald J. Trump.
The question Thursday, as the shares sank another 2 percent, was whether investors were outraged enough to deliver an uncommon rebuke to top management -- one that could put pressure on Paul Achleitner, the supervisory board chairman, to resign.
The result, after dozens of shareholders took a lectern to rail against Mr. Achleitner and other top managers, was mixed. Mr. Achleitner avoided an embarrassing vote of no confidence, but the margin signaled that a substantial number of shareholders are unhappy with his leadership. Investors also signaled dissatisfaction with Garth Ritchie, the head of Deutsche Bank's money-losing investment bank.
Mr. Achleitner benefited from the forbearance of large shareholders who are not happy with his performance but fear the impact of further management turmoil. There is also a dearth of credible successors in Germany.
"It's shocking and sad what has become of Deutsche Bank," Alexandra Annecke, a portfolio manager at Union Investment, a German fund manager, told shareholders.
But she said the fund, which owns 0.4 percent of Deutsche Bank shares, would vote to ratify management. "We want to give Mr. Sewing and Mr. Achleitner a chance," she said, referring to Christian Sewing, the chief executive.
Investors representing 72 percent of shares voted to ratify Mr. Achleitner's performance, down from 84 percent last year and slightly lower than for other members of the supervisory board. Tepid support for Mr. Achleitner could put pressure on him to resign before his term ends in 2022.
Mr. Ritchie is also under pressure after his performance was endorsed by 61 percent, a sharp decline from 95 percent in 2018.
In a speech to shareholders, Mr. Sewing, who received 75 percent approval, promised that he would address problems at the investment bank, which will face "tough cutbacks."
Sylvie Matherat, the bank's chief regulatory officer, also was ratified by only 61 percent as shareholders registered their frustration that Deutsche Bank continues to be battered by scandal.
Normally the vote to ratify top managers at German shareholder meetings is an almost unanimous formality. But investors in European companies have recently shown their willingness to force change at troubled companies.
Last month, corporate Germany was shocked when shareholders in Bayer, the drug and chemical maker, voted not to ratify the performance of the management board. The investors were enraged by the company's botched acquisition of American pesticide maker Monsanto.
It was the first time in memory that a German management had been confronted with such a vote of no confidence. It rattled boardrooms around the country and raised the question about whether Deutsche Bank's top managers would face a similar insurrection. Mr. Achleitner is a member of the Bayer supervisory board and observed the revolt firsthand.
"It was a big moment," Jim Rossman, a managing director at investment bank Lazard, said of the Bayer vote.
Mr. Rossman is head of a unit at Lazard that helps companies fend off attacks on management by hedge funds and other activist investors. He told reporters this month that the activist funds, often with the quiet support of big mutual funds, had lately been targeting European companies, demanding changes that they think will deliver a bigger payoff for shareholders.
The possibility of a no-confidence vote rose after shareholder advisory firms urged investors to send a message.
"We believe it is time for shareholders to hold the boards accountable for the many years of substantial monetary and reputational costs to the bank borne by shareholders," one of the firms, Institutional Shareholder Services, said in a report this month that advised clients to vote against ratifying Deutsche Bank's management and supervisory boards.
ISS and Glass, Lewis & Company, another influential advisory firm advocating a vote of no confidence, cited the damage inflicted on the bank's finances and reputation by persistent money-laundering scandals.
On Wednesday, Deutsche Bank acknowledged that it had used faulty software to screen customer transactions for suspicious activity. The bank said it had alerted regulators and was working to fix the problem as soon as possible.
Mr. Sewing, the chief executive, promised Thursday to improve the bank's internal controls. But he also suggested that the bank was unfairly targeted when German prosecutors raided company offices in Frankfurt in November as part of a money-laundering investigation. The negative media coverage "hit us hard," Mr. Sewing told shareholders.
"It is, of course, a criminal investigator's duty to conduct a thorough examination of any suspicious circumstance," he said. "However, it's possible to have diverging views on the manner in which it happened in November."
"We still have no concrete evidence that would support the allegations against us or any of our employees," Mr. Sewing said.
In response to questions from shareholders, Karl von Rohr, the bank's chief administrative officer, defended its decision not to tell regulators about multiple transactions involving legal entities controlled by Mr. Trump and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner. The transactions, reported by The New York Times this week, were flagged by the bank's anti-money laundering specialists.
"There are processes that in this case functioned," Mr. von Rohr said. "There was nothing unusual" about the way the transactions were handled, he said.
Shareholders directed special wrath at Mr. Achleitner, a longtime mover and shaker in the German economy.
"I have had enough of the way you destroy our wealth," said Karl-Walter Freitag, a shareholder activist who is a fixture at German annual meetings. "You're by far the worst chairman the bank has ever had."
"Have I made mistakes in the last seven years?" Mr. Achleitner responded. "Of course I've made mistakes. Am I the source of all the problems? Of course not."

Anita Hill calls talk of 'women as vice-presidential candidates' by 2020 Democrats is sexist

Texto completo: It is “really, deeply troubling” that female Democrats running in the primary race have been floated as vice presidential picks, said Anita Hill.
Hill, who testified before Congress in 1991 that she was sexually harassed by now-Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, told the New York Times she is concerned female presidential hopefuls aren’t viewed as significant candidates.
“And I think if we don’t take them seriously as presidential candidates, we are not going to hear those voices,” she said. “And that would be a tragedy.”
Last week, Sen. Kamala Harris of California said Joe Biden would make a “great running mate” because “he's proven that he knows how to do the job.” The comment was made after she was asked where she was annoyed that she’s been suggested as a great pick for vice president.
But Hill denied she was singling out Biden, who is most popular in polls.
“I don’t know that it’s just him. I think that that presumption about women as vice-presidential choices is not just about Joe Biden specifically, it’s about Joe Biden as the front-runner,” Hill said.
Biden was chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee when Hill testified before the panel about her accusations against Thomas. Biden called her last month to apologize for “what she endured” during her testimony, but Hill said the apology was inadequate and she would not support him in his presidential bid.
“I cannot be satisfied by simply saying I’m sorry for what happened to you. I will be satisfied when I know there is real change and real accountability and real purpose,” she said.

Texto completo: Be honest, now: What's so bad about meetings?
There must be something, right?
Whether the meeting is a brainstorming session, status update or an executive spiel on the company's flimsy future, even the best employees do not look forward to being called into a conference room.
As for the worst employees -- and yes, I'm talking thee and me -- we would rather be called into a dentist's office (a defrocked dentist who has replaced the numbing power of Novocain with sonic injections of the Bangtan Boys' latest hits).
Now, you may think that the trouble with meetings is the subject matter or the participants or the lack of artisanal donuts, but the problem may not be who is in the conference room. Chances are, the problem is what is in the conference room air.
It's our old friend carbon dioxide, CO2 to its friends. There's simply not enough oxygen and too much carbon dioxide -- a main ingredient in our exhalations -- which is also the pollutant "whose most detrimental effects are on the mind."
Or so Veronique Greenwood warns in her recent article "Is Conference Room Air Making You Dumber?" featured in The New York Times.
"Small rooms can build up heat and carbon dioxide from our breath -- as well as other substances -- to an extent that might surprise you," Greenwood writes. "And as it happens, a small body of evidence suggests that when it comes to decision making, indoor air may matter more than we have realized."
I know you don't need any outside help to make you dumber, but if too much carbon dioxide really does disrupt the limited thinking power you have, you can't wait until management resolves to move all meetings outside.
(An excellent meeting site could be the talcum-powder white beaches of Bora Bora, BTW, though you could get sand in your laser pointer.)
One reason conference room air has become so toxic is that modern buildings are sealed. While a sealed building may reduce the energy needed for heating and cooling -- and certainly does make it difficult to express your dissatisfaction with management by jumping out a window -- it has "also made it easier for gasses and other substances released by humans and our belongings to build up inside."
When stuck in a teeny tiny conference room full of yapping co-workers, the carbon dioxide levels can get seriously high. And it's not just your fellow employees who are to blame.
As Greenwood explains, "Worrisome substances emitted by new furniture, office supplies and carpets could be accumulating in the air."
In other words, you weren't being paranoid when you told human resources that your office chair was out to get you. It is, and it's in cahoots with the carpets!
If management is unconcerned with the problem, scientists around the world have taken action. A series of studies at the University of California, Berkeley; the Technical University of Denmark; and, of course, Harvard have shown that CO2 in the conference room can produce "striking, really quite dramatic impacts on decision-making performance."
On the positive side, this "mental fuzziness" gets more serious as the complexity of the issue under discussion increases. For simpler tests of cognitive ability, the impact of CO2 is lessened. This is good news for you since the matters with which you deal are so simple a monkey could handle them. And does.
The solution to the problem is simple, though probably impossible to implement. Unless you can make the IT department purchase a specialized CO2 sensor, which they wouldn't know how to work anyway, you must convince management to increase the flow of oxygen in your conference rooms.
Plus, all the carpet has to be pulled up and all evil office chairs plotting your doom must be sent to office-furniture prison.
You could also limit the number of people in the meeting. Get rid of the participants whose basic contributions are usually a lot of hot air, anyway. Anyone who has had pizza within the last 24 hours should also be excused. Carbon dioxide is bad business, but pepperoni breath is worse.
Most important of all, excuse yourself. Explain that you are totally fascinated by the subject of the meeting, but for the benefit of those remaining, you will reduce your carbon dioxide contribution to zero. This suggestion should be immediately accepted since your percentage of useful contributions to most meetings is also zero.
If they insist your presence is needed, tell them you'll be happy to participate. All they have to do is move the meeting to Bora Bora.

Durant to Clippers? It just might happen

Texto completo: The Clippers' season ended last month but they were the most talked-about team in the league on Wednesday.
That's what happens apparently when you have a day off on the NBA playoff schedule and the Lakers take a momentary break from airing their dirty laundry on national television.
While the Clippers have long been thought of as the favorite to land Kawhi Leonard in free agency, they emerged as perhaps an equally favored destination for Kevin Durant when he also becomes a free agent this summer.

Marc Stein of the New York Times sent NBA Twitter into a frenzy when he wrote, "Within the last month, very smart and plugged-in people I have consulted say that the Los Angeles Clippers have emerged as an equally dangerous threat to the Knicks to sign Durant away from Golden State. And I believe it."
The Clippers will have two maximum slots to sign players this summer and they were always going to make a run at Leonard and Durant but were viewed as more of a longshot for Durant. While speaking on a panel in New York this week, Rich Kleiman, Durant's business manager, said Durant is "100%" undecided about his future.
That makes sense for a player in the midst of trying to win his third straight title, but his interest in the Clippers also makes sense. Kendrick Perkins, who was a teammate of Durant's in Oklahoma City and played for Doc Rivers in Boston, further fueled the Durant-to-the-Clippers talk when he sat down with Kristine Leahy on her show "Fair Game."
"Don't be surprised if KD signs with the Clippers," Perkins said. "Everybody is screaming New York but do not be surprised if KD signs and plays for Doc. I don't even have to recruit him. He likes the organization. He likes Doc Rivers."
The Clippers will have some familiar faces in the room should they sit down with Durant this summer. Clippers consultant Jerry West was with the Warriors when Golden State successfully recruited Durant three years ago. He helped sell Durant on the idea of the Warriors being the best landing spot for him if he wanted to win championships and have fun.
When West, who successfully recruited Shaquille O'Neal to the Lakers in 1996, talks, people listen. There's just something about advice coming from the man silhouetted in the NBA logo that carries a little more weight. Durant knows and respects Clippers general manager Michael Winger, who was with Oklahoma City for seven seasons and was the assistant general manager while Durant was there, and Clippers assistant coach Rex Kalamian, who was an assistant in Oklahoma City from 2009 to 2015.
Durant, who has an offseason home in Malibu, filmed his "Boardroom" show at the Los Angeles Athletic Club and has aspirations to do more off the court and in technology, which Steve Ballmer, Clippers owner and former Microsoft chief executive, knows a thing or two about. The Clippers will sell Durant on building a legacy of his own on a team of his own.
There's no denying Durant's greatness as a player, but the Warriors' six straight playoff wins while he has been sidelined with a calf injury drives home the popular belief that they don't need Durant to win a championship. They had won a championship and were coming off a record-breaking 73-win season when Durant joined Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, Andre Iguodala and Shaun Livingston in 2016.
Even if Durant returns to the court to win his third straight title and third straight Finals MVP, many will believe he simply joined a team that would have won it all without him.
With the Clippers, he could cement his legacy as one of the greatest players ever by doing what no player has ever done before -- turn them into champions. He would be making history if he just got them past the second round, which is something the franchise has never done. But the tandem of Durant and Leonard, arguably the top two players this postseason when healthy, would make the Clippers at least co-favorites to win it all next season along with the Warriors.
"You can see Kevin Durant going there," Perkins said Wednesday while talking to Colin Cowherd on FS1. "They're in L.A. He can flourish and be himself and it would be his team. I would love to see KD play for a coach like Doc Rivers and assistant coaches like Rex, Sam Cassel and Armond Hill. They have a great group of guys. The way Doc draws up plays with his play calling, I could just imagine the plays he would draw up for Kevin Durant."
Durant saw during the Warriors' six-game series with the Clippers how good their returning core is. Lou Williams and Montrezl Harrell are both up for the sixth man of the year award, Rivers is up for coach of the year and the rookie backcourt of Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Landry Shamet were selected to the all-rookie second team.
The Clippers exceeded expectations last season by winning 48 games and nearly pushing Golden State to the distance in the playoffs. The team now wants to exceed expectations this offseason.
If Durant wants to carve out his own legacy and be remembered for more than riding the coattails of an already great team, his clearest path would be signing with the Clippers and leading them to their first title. In doing so he would be rewriting the history of a franchise and altering the perception of a player far greater than a replaceable cog on a championship squad.

Roger Stone contacts John Durham about FBI surveillance

Texto completo: Longtime Trump confidant Roger Stone sent a letter to U.S. Attorney John Durham this week seeking answers about whether he was a subject of surveillance by the U.S. government.
"We have strong reason to believe that Mr. Stone was among three advisors to candidate Trump who was under surveillance by the FBI during the 2016 presidential campaign," Stone's lawyer Paul Jensen wrote in the letter obtained by The Hill. Jensen also said Stone's Fourth Amendment rights may have been violated.
Durham has been tasked by Attorney General William Barr with reviewing the origins of the counterintelligence investigation into President Trump's campaign.
Jensen cited a January 2017 New York Times article titled "Intercepted Russian Communications Part of Inquiry Into Trump Associates," which names Stone as one of at least three Trump campaign associates under scrutiny by American law enforcement and intelligence agencies. The other two were Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort and onetime Trump campaign adviser Carter Page.
Jensen also sent letters, dated May 20, to House Intelligence Committee ranking member Devin Nunes, R-Calif., and Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.
The correspondence said Stone has reached out to the White House counsel to urge Trump to declassify documents related to the Russia investigation. If these records from the Justice Department and FBI are not released, Jensen said he would resort to suing the federal government.
According to Rep. Mark Meadows, a close ally of Trump, the declassification of Russia investigation documents are "right around the corner." In what appeared to be a nod of approval, Trump retweeted a Washington Examiner article of Meadows' comment on Wednesday.
Stone was arrested at his Florida home on Jan. 25 in a pre-dawn raid by the FBI. He was later charged by special counsel Robert Mueller with lying to Congress, witness tampering, and obstructing justice. Stone was released on a $250,000 bond and has pleaded not guilty. He is set to go on trial starting Nov. 5.

Why Did Deutsche Bank Keep Lending to Donald Trump? — “Trump, Inc.” Podcast

Texto completo: Stay up to date with email updates about WNYC and ProPublica’s investigations into the president’s business practices.
Whispers of money laundering have swirled around Donald Trump’s businesses for years. One of his casinos, for example, was fined $10 million for not trying hard enough to prevent such machinations. Investors with shady financial histories sometimes popped up in his foreign ventures. And on Sunday, The New York Times reported that anti-money-laundering specialists at Deutsche Bank internally flagged multiple transactions by Trump companies as suspicious. (A spokesperson for the Trump Organization called the article “absolute nonsense.”)
The remarkably troubled recent history of Deutsche Bank, its past money-laundering woes — and the bank’s striking relationship with Trump — are the subjects of this week’s episode of the “Trump, Inc.” podcast. The German bank loaned a cumulative total of around $2.5 billion to Trump projects over the past two decades, and the bank continued writing him nine-figure checks even after he defaulted on a $640 million obligation and sued the bank, blaming it for his failure to pay back the debt.
“Trump, Inc.” isn’t the only one examining the president’s relationship with the bank. Congressional investigators have gone to court seeking the kind of detailed — and usually secret — banking records that could reveal potential misdeeds related to the president’s businesses, according to recent filings by two congressional committees. The filings were made in response to a highly unusual move by lawyers for Trump, his family and his company seeking to quash congressional subpoenas issued to Deutsche Bank and Capital One, a second institution he banked with. Trump’s lawyers have contended that the congressional subpoenas “were issued to harass” Trump and damage him politically.
Earlier today, a federal judge in New York declined to issue a preliminary injunction to block the subpoenas. During the hearing in which he delivered that ruling, U.S. District Judge Edgardo Ramos said Congress is within its rights to require the banks to turn over Trump’s financial information, even if the disclosure is harmful to him.
Listen to the Episode
For their part, the filings for the House Financial Services and Intelligence committees say they are “investigating serious and urgent questions concerning the safety of banking practices, money laundering in the financial sector, foreign influence in the U.S. political process, and the threat of foreign financial leverage, including over the President.” The inquiry includes investigating whether Trump’s accounts were involved in two large schemes involving Deutsche Bank and Russian clients.
The committees want to determine “the volume of illicit funds that may have flowed through the bank, and whether any touched the accounts held there by Mr. Trump, his family, or business.” Links to Russia will get a particularly close look. “The Committee is examining whether Mr. Trump’s foreign business deals and financial ties were part of the Russian government’s efforts to entangle business and political leaders in corrupt activity or otherwise obtain leverage over them,” the filing stated.
The podcast explores some eyebrow-raising Trump-related moves by the bank:
* Deutsche Bank’s private wealth unit loaned Trump $48 million — after he had defaulted on his $640 million loan and the bank’s commercial unit didn’t want to lend him any further funds — so that Trump could pay back another unit of Deutsche Bank. “No one has ever seen anything like it,” said David Enrich, finance editor of The New York Times, who is writing a book about the bank and spoke to “Trump, Inc.”
* Deutsche Bank loaned Trump’s company $125 million as part of the overall $150 million purchase of the ailing Doral golf resort in Miami in 2012. The loans’ primary collateral was land and buildings that he paid only $105 million for, county land records show. The apparent favorable terms raise questions about whether the bank’s loan was unusually risky.
* To widespread alarm, and at least one protest that Trump would not be able to pay his lease obligations, Deutsche Bank’s private wealth group loaned the Trump Organization an additional $175 million to renovate the Old Post Office Building in Washington and turn it into a luxury hotel.
Like Trump, Deutsche Bank has been scrutinized for its dealings in Russia. The bank paid more than $600 million to regulators in 2017 and agreed to a consent order that cited “serious compliance deficiencies” that “spanned Deutsche Bank’s global empire.” The case focused on “mirror trades,” which Deutsche Bank facilitated between 2011 and 2015. The trades were sham transactions whose sole purpose appeared to be to illicitly convert rubles into pounds and dollars — some $10 billion worth.
A spokesperson said Deutsche Bank has increased its anti-financial-crime staff in recent years and is “committed to cooperating with authorized investigations.” The bank said it has policies in place to address the potential for conflicts of interest, including “special measures with respect to clients that hold public office or perform public functions in the U.S.”
The bank was “laundering money for wealthy Russians and people connected to Putin and the Kremlin in a variety of ways for almost the exact time period that they were doing business with Donald Trump,” Enrich said. “And all of that money through Deutsche Bank was being channeled through the same exact legal entity in the U.S. that was handling the Donald Trump relationship in the U.S. And so there are a lot of coincidences here.”

Texto completo: Billionaire's grant will wipe out Morehouse class's student debt
ATLANTA -- A billionaire technology investor and philanthropist says he will provide grants to wipe out the student debt of the entire graduating class at Morehouse College -- an estimated $40 million.
Robert F. Smith, this year's commencement speaker, made the announcement Sunday morning while addressing nearly 400 graduating seniors of the all-male historically black college in Atlanta. Smith is the Founder and CEO of Vista Equity Partners, a private equity firm that invests in software, data, and technology-driven companies.
"On behalf of the eight generations of my family that have been in this country, we're gonna put a little fuel in your bus," Smith told the graduates. "This is my class, 2019. And my family is making a grant to eliminate their student loans."
The announcement elicited stunned looks from faculty and students alike, before the graduates broke into the biggest cheers of the morning. Morehouse said it is the single largest gift to the college.
Smith, who received an honorary doctorate from Morehouse during the ceremony, had already announced a $1.5 million gift to the school.
The pledge to eliminate student debt for the class of 2019 is estimated to be $40 million.
In the weeks before graduating from Morehouse on Sunday, 22-year-old finance major Aaron Mitchom drew up a spreadsheet to calculate how long it would take him to pay back his $200,000 in student loans -- 25 years at half his monthly salary, per his calculations.
In an instant, that number vanished. Mitchom, sitting in the crowd, wept.

Report: Trump, Kushner bank transactions raised red flag
NEW YORK -- Multiple transactions involving legal entities controlled by President Donald Trump and his son-in-law Jared Kushner aroused the suspicion of anti-money laundering specialists at Deutsche Bank in 2016 and 2017, according to The New York Times.
The specialists recommended the matter be referred to a unit of the Treasury Department that polices financial crimes, but bank executives rejected their advice, the newspaper reported on Sunday.
As a result, the "suspicious activity reports" about the transactions were never filed with the government, the New York Times reported.
The report didn't give specifics about the nature of the transactions but said some of them involved money being transferred back and forth with foreign entities or individuals.

Report: Navy submariners kept list rating female crew, sex acts
Sailors aboard a U.S. Navy submarine circulated sexually explicit lists that ranked female crew members, an investigation found. The lists, first reported Friday by Military.com, were uncovered through a Freedom of Information Act request.
The 74-page investigative report reveals two lists -- one with Yelp-like star ratings on the women and another containing "lewd and sexist comments" beside each woman's name, according to Military.com.
In February 2018, the USS Florida became the second to integrate female members. The misconduct came to light four months later, when two sailors aboard the Florida brought the lists to a superior officer, reporting that they were stored on an internal computer network and updated regularly, Military.com reported.

In oil-rich Venezuela, mile-long lines to buy gas in major city
MARACAIBO, Venezuela -- U.S. sanctions on oil-rich Venezuela appear to be taking hold, resulting in mile-long lines for fuel in the South American nation's second-largest city, Maracaibo.
Some drivers said they'd had to wait almost 24 hours to fuel up, and people have been grabbing catnaps on the hoods of cars or in truck beds.
Nearing empty and stuck in line, infectious diseases doctor Yoli Urdaneta said she couldn't make her shift to treat patients.
"I've spent four days trying to get gasoline," Urdaneta said. "But I couldn't."
Russ Dallen, a Miami-based partner at the brokerage firm Caracas Capital Markets, said Sunday that stiff U.S. sanctions on top of Venezuela's decaying refineries has begun to hit home.

Man charged in abduction of girl, 8, from street
FORT WORTH, Texas -- A man has been charged in the abduction of an 8-year-old girl who was snatched from a street in Fort Worth, Texas, as she walked with her mother.
Fort Worth police say the girl was found safe Sunday, about eight hours later, at a hotel in nearby Forest Hill.
Police say 51-year-old Michael Webb was arrested on an aggravated kidnapping charge. He is being held without bond.
Officer Buddy Calzada says a man grabbed the girl Saturday evening, and sped away with her in a car. Police released surveillance video of the car. Police found Webb and the girl at the hotel after witnesses reported seeing the car there.
She was taken to a hospital.
Online records don't show an attorney representing Webb who can speak on his behalf.

Plane crash in Honduras kills 4 Americans, 1 Canadian
TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras -- Four Americans and a Canadian pilot were killed when a small plane went down off the coast of Roatan island in Honduras, officials said Sunday.
Armed Forces spokesman Jose Domingo Meza confirmed the nationalities of those who died in Saturday's crash.
The Piper Cherokee Six plummeted into the Atlantic shortly after takeoff from the popular tourist destination of Roatan en route to the port of Trujillo. The military said in a statement that rescue boats with police divers and firefighters recovered four bodies within minutes of the crash, and transported another to a hospital, where he later died.
The U.S. State Department also confirmed the deaths of four U.S. citizens. They did not release names.

In Indiana: An explosion leveled a home in southern Indiana early Sunday, killing one person, injuring two others and leaving several nearby homes uninhabitable, authorities said.
Hours after the explosion shattered windows across a Jeffersonville neighborhood and sent debris flying onto roofs, lawns and cars, officials had not said what they believe caused the explosion.
Indiana State Police, Jeffersonville police and firefighters were at the scene, along with crews from Vectren, a natural gas provider.
Jeffersonville police Lt. Isaac Parker told The Courier-Journal that the house exploded just before 5 a.m. Sunday in the Ohio River city.

Rights for LGBTQ extended in House bill

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - The House passed sweeping legislation Friday that would prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity.
The bill, passed 236-173, comes as departments across the Trump administration have dismantled policies friendly to gay, bisexual and transgender individuals, like barring transgender recruits from serving in the military or formally rejecting complaints filed by transgender students who are barred from restrooms that match their gender identity.
"The question before us is not whether the LGBTQ community faces outrageous and immoral discrimination, for the record shows that it clearly does," said Rep. Jerrold Nadler of New York, chairman of the Judiciary Committee. "The question is whether we, as Congress, are willing to take action to do something about it. The answer goes straight to the heart of who we want to be as a country - and today, that answer must be a resounding 'yes.'"
The legislation, which amends the Civil Rights Act of 1964, prohibits discrimination of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people in both the public and private sectors, offering civil rights protections in businesses, hospitals and welfare services. It explicitly states that individuals cannot be denied access to a locker room or dressing room on the same basis.
The response from the Republican-controlled Senate and White House, however, is likely to be a resounding no.
Citing concern for "the safety of women and girls in intimate spaces" and "conscience protections" in place for medical professionals who decline to perform procedures they find morally objectionable, the administration opposes the measure, according to a draft statement of administration policy obtained by The New York Times. While affirming the administration's "belief in the dignity of every person," the draft also cited concerns that the bill could "force schools to teach and affirm sex education that includes self-identified gender identity."
House Republicans mirrored those fears Friday. Rep. Doug Collins of Georgia, the ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee, took to the floor to argue that the legislation would harm children and set back the civil rights gains won by women.
"I implore my colleagues to listen to the stories of every stakeholder here, including the transgender girls and boys this bill is meant to help - because we may be hurting them by allowing doctors to prescribe hormones and perform major surgeries on adolescents without parental consent or involvement," Collins said.
Since taking offite, President Donald Trump's administration has enacted a sweeping deconstruction of policies and rules intended to protect gay and transgender individuals. In 2017, the Justice Department sided with a cake shop owner who refused to make a wedding cake for a same-sex couple, filing legal briefs arguing that a landmark 1964 civil rights law did not ban discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. Jeff Sessions, then the attorney general, also rescinded guidance for schools that was intended to protect transgender students in bathrooms and locker rooms.
Similar efforts have been undertaken by other Cabinet members. The Department of Health and Human Services spearheaded an effort to establish a legal definition of sex as a biological, immutable condition determined by genitalia at birth, The Times reported last year.
The administration has also appointed several judges who have advocated dismantling protections based on sexual orientation. Jeff Mateer, whose nomination to the district court was later dropped, described transgender children as evidence of "Satan's plan." Mateer and another district court nominee, Matthew J. Kacsmaryk, wrote a brief to the Department of Health and Human Services that sought to roll back civil rights protections for transgender people, citing a scientist at Johns Hopkins University who argued that the "sense of being transgendered constitutes a mental disorder." Kacsmaryk is waiting for the full Senate to take up his nomination.
"Despite significant advances, LGBT people across the country remain vulnerable to discrimination on a daily basis and too often have little recourse," said Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., lead sponsor of the bill. "It is past time for the Equality Act to be written into law."

Texto completo: With so many familiar names around us that have their origins in Native American tongues, it's a wonder many of us don't know more about the people and their culture. Here's a good opportunity to learn: the 26th Spring Planting Moon pow-wow at the Marshfield Fairgrounds on Saturday and Sunday .
Anthony Silva, a member of the board of the Massachusetts Center for Native American Awareness, says the annual event is a chance for some of the more than 37,000 Native Americans in Massachusetts and elsewhere to gather as a community.
“And it's a way for us to educate the public about Native Americans that are here now and also about Native American history and culture, by allowing the public to be directly involved at an event — that is, participate instead of just watching something on TV," he says. “The public will have an opportunity to talk to Native Americans about who we are and about our culture."
The gates to the Fairgrounds, 140 Main St., will be open from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. both days. There'll be music, foods, crafts, storytelling, intertribal dances, and other traditions in which people, especially children, are encouraged to join in. (Don't worry, the emcee, Earle “Chiefy Mills" of the Mashpee Wampanoag, will announce when the audience may participate.)
If you miss the Marshfield gathering, there's a bigger one later this year in Haverhill: the 31st annual Intertribal Pow-Wow at Plug Pond the weekend after Labor Day. And this year, Silva says, the center-sponsored summer pow-wow, last held in 2016, will return to Endicott Park in Danvers on June 29 and 30. For more information, visit mcnaa.org.
Other happenings: In Boston Tuesday , nursing home advocates, including residents and their families, nurses, nursing assistants, administrators, and various staff, will rally at the State House to urge lawmakers to increase funding and address what they say is a financial and workforce crisis in the sector. Nearly 70 percent of nursing home residents rely on MassHealth, the state's Medicaid program, to pay for their care, the advocates say, and government underfunding by some $362 million annually has led to at least 29 closures. The Massachusetts Senior Care Association rally begins at 10 a.m. Visit maseniorcare.org.
The Arlington Center for the Arts has an unusual exhibit of quilts by local artist Julie Brown Neu now through June 10 that explores gun violence. “Disarming: Memorial Quilts for Mass Shooting Victims" includes more than a dozen quilts, plus “Bullet Holes," a piece in which 796 holes represent victims of mass shootings from 1990 to 2018, and “In Our Sights," which incorporates pages from The New York Times about the massacre in Las Vegas in 2017. The center, at 20 Academy St., is open Monday through Friday from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m . Visit acarts.org.
The Northborough Free Library's Spring Music Series features The Hollands! -- a multinational family band that plays Americana and folk revival music -- on Saturday at 2 p.m. The library, at 34 Main St., is closed for the Memorial Day weekend, but the concert will take place in the Main Meeting Room.Visit www.thehollands.org.
In Lowell , the Brush Art Gallery and Studios, 256 Market St., is hosting contemporary works by more than 30 members of the National Association of Women Artists' Massachusetts chapter now through June 6 . Titled “Breaking Point," the juried exhibit of various mediums explores the artist's struggle to be true to an inner vision versus the need for attention. Gallery hours are Tuesday through Saturday, 11 a.m. to 4 p.m., and Sunday, noon to 4 p.m. Visit thebrush.org.
And here's a chance to spite the rainy weather of the past few weeks: The Nashua River Watershed Association is holding a “Walk at Bolton Flats Wildlife Management Area" on Tuesday from 6 to 8 p.m. for the public to take in the Pine Hill site. The walk will be guided by Chris Buelow, senior restoration ecologist with MassWildlife's Natural Heritage Endangered Species Program and will start on Pine Hill Road in Bolton. Expect some mud.

U.S. consumer sentiment jumped to the strongest level since 2004 on a surge in economic expectations following a strong report on first-quarter growth. The University of Michigan's preliminary sentiment index rose to 102.4 in May. Still, a recent flare-up in trade tensions between China and the United States may weigh on future readings as price pressures hit consumers and weigh on the economic outlook.

Shares of Luckin Coffee, a fast-growing rival to Starbucks in China, rose 20% in their U.S. stock market debut Friday. The Chinese company, which opened its first store in Beijing less than two years ago, has 2,370 locations and plans to surpass the 3,700 stores Starbucks has in China by the end of the year. But unlike Starbucks, Luckin is losing money.

Europe Is Wary of Confronting U.S. on Iran, but Is Warier of a War

Texto completo: BRUSSELS -- With strong memories of the last catastrophic war in Iraq, Europeans are united in opposing what many consider the United States' effort to provoke Iran into a shooting war. Yet, despite the strains in trans-Atlantic relations in the Trump years, flat-out opposition to Washington remains an uncomfortable place for European nations.
Initially, not even pro-American Britain would go along with the Trump administration, with officials defending a senior British general in the coalition fighting the Islamic State who said that there was no enhanced threat from Iran in Iraq and Syria.
But that brought an American rebuttal, and soon the Europeans, reluctant to confront Washington directly, softened the criticism. Britain officially rowed back, saying that it now agreed with the Americans, while Germany and the Netherlands suspended their troop training in Iraq, citing the American warnings. (Germany subsequently said it was planning to resume the training exercises.)
Window dressing aside, however, there was little doubt about where the Europeans stood on the Iran issue.
"Every single European government believes that the increased threat we're seeing from Iran now is a reaction to the United States leaving the Iran nuclear agreement and trying to force Iranian capitulation on other issues," said Kori Schake, a former Pentagon official who is now deputy director of the International Institute for Strategic Studies.
"They believe that the U.S. is the provocateur and they worry that the U.S. is reacting so stridently to predictable Iranian actions in order to provide a pretext for a U.S. attack on Iran," Ms. Schake said.
It is a far cry from the debate preceding the 2003 Iraq war, which "split Europe in two," said Tomas Valasek, the director of Carnegie Europe and a former Slovak ambassador to NATO. "This is a case of all European governments saying to Washington that this is insane, we shouldn't be here, and it's your fault that we're actually talking of war."
For a supporter of the trans-Atlantic relationship, he added, "the last thing you want to do is unify Europe on an anti-American basis, and that's what Trump" and his national security adviser, John R. Bolton, have done.
The Europeans are trapped between President Trump and Tehran, trying to keep decent relations with Washington while committed to supporting the 2015 Iran nuclear deal that Mr. Trump mocked and then abandoned.
Senior European government officials say they believe that Mr. Trump, as he said on Thursday, does not want a major war in the Middle East. But they also believe that Mr. Bolton does. They often cite a New York Times opinion article by Mr. Bolton in 2015, when he was out of office, entitled "To Stop Iran's Bomb, Bomb Iran."
And European officials are baffled by Mr. Trump's insistence that he simply wants to force Iran into new negotiations. Why, they say, would Tehran, whose supreme leader regards Washington as duplicitous in any event, concede or even value any deal done with the president who just abandoned a nuclear deal so painfully negotiated with the last American president?
"Why would they trust us now after Trump pulled the plug on the last thing they negotiated with Washington?" Ms. Schake said.
The public position of European officials has been to urge "maximum restraint," as the European foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, put it. That was a riposte to Washington's stated policy of "maximum pressure" on Tehran, including punishing economic sanctions designed to block its international trade, especially in oil, on which the economy depends.
Foreign ministers -- including Britain's Jeremy Hunt and Germany's Heiko Maas -- have spoken about the dangers of escalation and accidental war.
"We are very worried about the risk of a conflict happening by accident with an escalation that is unintended," Mr. Hunt said.
Mr. Maas told German legislators that putting intense pressure on Iran added to the risk of an unintended escalation. "What has happened in recent days -- acts of sabotage against ships or pipelines -- are indications that these dangers are concrete and real," he said, referring to reports that four oil vessels were recently attacked at the mouth of the Persian Gulf.
While initially skeptical of American warnings of an increased threat to its troops from Iran and its allies, most European officials now accept the American concerns, even as they consider the response exaggerated and provocative.
Iran's responses to American pressure were predicted by the Pentagon, Centcom and American intelligence agencies, Ms. Schake said.
"So Europeans are exasperated that the U.S. wants them to snap into line for a policy they believe is wrong, and with the consequences that they and the Pentagon and U.S. intelligence all told the Trump administration it would produce."
No one should be surprised, she and others said, that Iran would use its own leverage -- including the restarting of uranium enrichment (still within the limits of the nuclear deal), its militias, proxies and arms transfers -- within the region to respond to Washington in an asymmetric way.
"The Iranians may have walked into a Washington hard-liner trap," said Jeremy Shapiro, a former senior State Department official who is now research director for the European Council on Foreign Relations. "Iran as usual is sending messages and going up the escalator ladder one-eighth of a step at a time, through proxies," he said. "They're following the script. Iranian and U.S. hard-liners have a toxic interaction and feed off each other."
In the first gulf war, in 1990-91, the United States led a broad multinational coalition; in the second, in 2003, the European "coalition of the willing" was essentially reduced to Britain and Poland.
Part of Europe's skepticism is rooted in that 2003 war, when there were charges of fake or exaggerated intelligence, which continue to haunt the reputations of then-loyal European leaders, such as former Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain and former President Aleksander Kwasniewski of Poland.
"Every European politician who supported George W. Bush was taken out and effectively executed," Mr. Shapiro said. "Even in the U.K., no way there can be a repeat of that. If the U.S. policy is force, there will be no European support."
But the Trump administration -- which has already strained relations with Europe badly through unilateral moves over trade, climate change and relations with Israel and Russia, let alone Iran -- probably doesn't much care what the Europeans think, Mr. Shapiro said: "No one in the administration is expecting much help from Europe over this."
Still, he noted, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo made an effort to come to Brussels and speak to European foreign ministers about Iran and American assessments of enhanced threat. For internal administration debates, European views will be taken into account, Mr. Shapiro said.
"If there is tacit support or even abstention," he said, "that can be helpful in the internal debates, to say, 'The allies are with us or against us."'
European officials consider the debate in Washington over Iran far from over, and they want to do their best, as one official said, to support Mr. Trump in his clear reluctance to get America involved in another messy war in the Middle East.

Texto completo: Grumpy Cat has died, and the only proper reaction for anyone who has followed the meme for the past several years is to be, well, a little grumpy.
Tweet
The cantankerous cat, whose feline dwarfism produced her meme-able grimace, was 2013’s meme of the year, and she has traveled through the public eye everywhere from the cover of New York magazine to the New York Times best-seller list to a Christmas movie.
It’s no secret that the internet is obsessed with cute cats, but why this grumpy one?
Grumpy Cat became a proxy for dark internet humor, where millennials joked about hating people and feeling like they "just can’t even." “There are two kinds of people in this world,” says one meme. “And I don’t like them.”
Inspiring nearly 900 pieces of merchandise on the Grumpy Cat shop and several books, from Grumpy Cat: A Grumpy Book to The Grumpy Guide to Life: Observations from Grumpy Cat, Grumpy Cat became an establishment. In a world of memes that are funny for a few weeks until everyone moves on to the next thing, Grumpy Cat remained as the face of the millennial misanthrope.
Yeah, people suck sometimes, and it took a perennially judgmental cat to remind people that it’s OK to feel that way. “Your face uses more muscles to frown than to smile,” says another meme. “What can I say, I’m addicted to fitness.”
The irony, which Grumpy Cat's owners point out in their memorial tweet, is that the cat's grumpiness became a source of levity for millions of fans. Grumpy Cat hit at the heart of viral culture, explaining why millions of people could unite around a picture of a cat: She could become a face for all of our grumpiest thoughts, a simple image that provided a mood with which we can all relate.
Photo Caption:FILE - This Dec. 1, 2015 file photo shows Grumpy Cat posing for a photo in Los Angeles. Grumpy Cat is joining the cast of the Broadway musical “Cats” on Friday, Sept. 30, 2016. The kitty with the comical frown “will be worked into the end of the show and will become an honorary Jellicle Cat,” according to a spokesman for the show.

The drift toward war with Iran

Texto completo: British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt concisely described the two big dangers embedded in the growing tensions between the United States and Iran. There is, he said Monday, "the risk of a conflict happening by accident, with an escalation that is unintended really on either side but ends with some kind of conflict. And there is also the possibility that Iran will be put "back on the path to renuclearization. What he didn't say was this: Both those dangers result directly from the Trump administration's escalation of pressure on the Iranian regime in recent months - a policy with no evident end goal and thus no plausible positive outcome.
President Donald Trump and his top aides insist they are not seeking war, but the measures they have adopted in the past month - including an attempt to shut down all Iranian exports of oil,as well as steel, copper and other products - appear to have brought them perilously close to it. Facing an economic crisis, the Islamic republic has predictably responded by threatening to resume high-level enrichment of uranium - the most dangerous activity stopped by the nuclear deal that Trump unwisely scrapped.
According to U.S. officials, Tehran also may be preparing strikes against U.S. forces in the Middle East or against commercial and military ships in the Persian Gulf. Attacks on four oil tankers near the mouth of the gulf on Sunday have not yet been attributed to Iran; Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Tuesday they were still being investigated. If Tehran is deemed responsible, Trump will come under pressure to deliver on threats of "a bad problem for Iran if something happens, as he put it Monday. The Pentagon has dispatched additional forces to the region, and the New York Times reported that plans have been drawn up to send tens of thousands more U.S. troops.
The Times also reported on U.S. intelligence that Iran may be seeking to provoke Trump into a military action. If so, it's not hard to see why. The United States is poorly prepared for another conflict in the region; it has the support of none of its NATO allies, not even - as Hunt made clear - Britain. The use of force probably would not stop Iran from resuming its nuclear program or force a change of regime, short of a full-scale military invasion. That would find scant support from Americans, and for good reason: Until Trump began his escalation, Iran was observing the nuclear deal and did not pose an imminent threat to the United States.
Trump says he's interested in negotiating with the regime of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, but it's not clear his top aides agree with him; they have laid out a series of demands they know Tehran will not meet. Pompeo conceded the other day that the U.S. strategy was unlikely to coerce Iranian leaders into concessions, but suggested that "what can change is, the people can change the government. But the United States has been waiting in vain for a popular revolution in Tehran for decades.
Trump is in danger of being cornered into choosing between a counterproductive use of force and allowing Iran to cross red lines. The way out is to return to diplomacy, in concert with European allies. The president should curb his hawkish aides and take that course before it is too late.

Texto completo: Syndicated Columnist
Washington
It’s a long-standing joke among journalists that the go-to political headline in a pinch is: “Democrats in Disarray.” Somewhere, somehow, it’s probably true.
So it’s a change of pace that a slew of reports in recent weeks amply justify the headline “NRA in Disarray.” Accounts about the organization’s financial crisis and internal dysfunction confirm what many of us have always suspected: The National Rifle Association is a racket that stokes fear, aggravates our country’s divisions and blocks reasoned debate about gun violence to feather the nests of the conservative elite. A self-dealing class exploits the anxieties of Americans far removed from power and turns the Second Amendment into a money machine.
No wonder President Donald Trump loves the NRA so much.
The most revelatory detail in the latest of these stories, a helpfully extensive investigation this week by Danny Hakim in The New York Times, concerns the fashion habits of Wayne LaPierre, the NRA’s longtime CEO. Hakim reports that LaPierre billed the organization, which claims to speak for the heartland, $275,000 “for purchases at the Zegna luxury men’s wear boutique in Beverly Hills.”
Beverly Hills?
Unlike LaPierre, I’m just an unsophisticated real American because I have never even heard of the Zegna luxury men’s wear boutique. Must be nice to have your lifestyle financed by the people you spend your time scaring to death. The biggest falsehood: Shameful claims that high school students and grieving parents who plead for more effective gun laws pose a dire threat to the way of life of our country’s small town and rural areas.
Yes, it will be delightful in the coming months to watch this pack of hypocritical demagogues gag on their counterfeit anti-elitist rhetoric as their organization faces fiscal and reputational embarrassment.
It will also be useful to learn more about why they seemed so eager to seek the favor of Russia and Vladimir Putin, how they funneled income to favored insiders, and why so many conservative politicians and activists have prostrated themselves before this golden calf erected to hallow high-capacity weapons.
That last reference comes straight from a thoughtful midwestern soul. It was invoked in 2018 by the Rev. Peter Marty, senior pastor of St. Paul Lutheran Church in Davenport, Iowa. “More than a hunting or safety device, the gun has become an object of reverence,” he wrote in The Christian Century. “We bow in devotion at its altar.” False gods usually serve profane purposes.
As often happens with racketeers, the NRA gang has had a falling out. That’s why we are getting so much new information as one bunch leaks against another. Quite a crew they have over there! And we will be learning more about the organization’s sketchy internal workings because New York Attorney General Letitia James is investigating the NRA’s tax-exempt status.
People abroad who wish our country well are mystified about why we seem so unable to legislate sanely on guns. Countries that have a lot in common with ours — most recently New Zealand and, in 1996, Australia — responded to gruesome killings by changing their weapons statutes with cross-partisan support.
We are paralyzed by two things. First, the conservative movement and the Republican Party have been the NRA’s willing agents. The organization’s board has been a who’s who of conservative glitterati. The anti-government right knows it can’t sell Americans of modest incomes on its opposition to minimum wages, corporate regulation or more progressive taxes. So they channel their arguments through the gun issue and pretend that this is really a culture war between, well, Beverly Hills elitists and the good folks of Middle America. It’s a big lie.
Let’s start asking the GOP’s politicians how they feel about being allied with a crowd that looks more and more like a bunch of swindlers.
And then there is the U.S. Senate, one of the most unrepresentative bodies in any democratic nation. Fact: The two Dakotas (population 1.6 million) have equal representation with New York and California (population 59.1 million). The House easily passed two bills in February strengthening background checks for gun purchasers, but they face a blockade in a GOP-led Senate where rural states have outsized power.
The NRA’s implosion should be an occasion for a new conversation between metropolitan and small-town America that is, in any event, much needed. The high-living gun lobbyists do not have rural America’s interests at heart. Advocates of gun safety do not disrespect fellow citizens who use guns responsibly. The real insult to them comes from the leaders who buy fancy clothes on their dime.

By Ronda Kaysen
Spring is here, and, for many, that means it's time for some serious housecleaning. But some of the products we use to make our surfaces shine may cause more harm than good.
For example, many common household cleaning products contain volatile organic compounds, which easily become vapors or gases. They are known to trigger asthma in some people and can also cause headaches and allergic reactions.
In a review of more than 2,000 cleaning products, the Environmental Working Group, a nonprofit advocacy organization, found that 53 percent contained ingredients known to irritate the lungs.
When those compounds are used at home, they can accumulate on surfaces. V.O.C. levels are two to five times higher indoors than out, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.
When cleaning products are thrown away or washed down the drain, the chemicals they contain, including things like benzene and formaldehyde, which are commonly found in air fresheners, ultimately end up in lakes, rivers and landfills.
Unfortunately, it's often hard to know what's in cleaning products because the companies that make them are not required to disclose ingredients. That's true even for products labeled "green" or "natural." The Environmental Working Group found that only 7 percent of the 2,000 cleaning products reviewed adequately disclosed ingredients.
So, how can you find out which cleaning products are really green?
Looking for the Environmental Protection Agency Safer Choice label on cleaning supplies is a good first step. The Safer Choice program reviews more than just product ingredients. It also looks at product performance and the sustainability of packaging. Once a product is approved, the E.P.A. conducts regular audits to ensure that standards continue to be upheld.
The Environmental Working Group also rates top green cleaning products.
Another option is to make your own cleaners with everyday household products like white vinegar, baking soda and Castile soap.
Making cleaning supplies "takes two minutes, if that, and it's incredibly cheap," said Kathryn Kellogg, the author of "101 Ways to Go Zero Waste." She said she cleans everything in her home, except the shower, with a spray bottle of vinegar and water. For the shower, she uses baking soda, hydrogen peroxide and liquid soap.
Finally, remember that disposable cleaning supplies like sponges, wipes and mop pads usually end up in landfills. Consider biodegradable sponges or washable, reusable supplies where possible.
Your lungs, your house and your planet may thank you for it.

Calculate Your Plastic Use
By John Schwartz
How much plastic do you use in your daily life? The answer may surprise you.
Plastics can now be found in every part of the world's oceans, even in the Arctic, with implications for marine life and, let's face it, the rest of us.
The most effective way to deal with the plastics problem in the oceans, many experts say, is to keep the waste from getting into the oceans in the first place. That means government-level action to manage waste and pressure on manufacturers to reclaim waste and to produce materials that degrade harmlessly. But individuals can play a part, too, by reducing their own use of disposable plastics.
That's where Hanna Pamula comes in. A Ph.D. student in Krakow, Poland, she designed a plastic footprint calculator for Omni Calculator, a Polish start-up. It's free, and handy for figuring out how your own plastic consumption compares to people around you. (The company has other Ecology Calculators on its website, as well.)
Ms. Pamula said that she designed this calculator "to raise awareness of the plastic pollution and our individual impact." She said she has been happy to see successful campaigns to use fewer plastic bags and straws, but that further action was needed. "That's great that we are more and more conscious, but it's still not enough and more efforts should be made to change our habits and lifestyle," she said.
It's a bare-bones tool. The simple questionnaire misses some of the ways we use plastics in our daily lives. Still, it's eye-opening. When I first took the test a few weeks ago, before exchanging emails with Ms. Pamula, the program told me I go through about 40 pounds of plastic a year. "Not Bad!" the program stated, though it seemed awfully bad to me. That much?
Still, the program provided an upbeat message. It encouraged me to carry on, try to reduce more and become a "low-plastic hero."
It compared my results to those of Europeans, who toss about 66 pounds per year. I mentioned to Ms. Pamula that it would be nice for users in the United States to see their totals compared to those of their countrymen; the next time I opened the page, the United States comparison point, about 110 pounds, was there.
If only fixing our environmental problems were so simple.

Texto completo: Lock him up?
Attorney General William Barr reportedly joked Wednesday with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. , about being put in handcuffs on the sidelines of an event honoring slain law enforcement officers outside the Capitol.
“Madam Speaker, did you bring your handcuffs?" Barr quipped to Pelosi, according to the New York Times and the Washington Post.
Pelosi smiled and offered her own tongue-in-cheek response. The House sergeant-at-arms was in attendance, should an arrest be necessary, the top Democrat told the attorney general. Barr reportedly chuckled and walked away, according to the outlets.
More: Is there a Capitol jail where Democrats could lock up Trump aides who refuse to testify?
The exchange comes as tensions between House Democrats and the Trump administration continue to rise over multiple requests for documents, testimony from Barr and other current and past administration officials, and subpoenas issued by multiple congressional committees.
Wednesday, the White House, in a 12-page letter to House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N. Y. , declined to hand over information requested by the panel as part of a wide-ranging investigation into President Donald Trump's presidency.
White House Counsel Pat Cipollone in the letter wrote that the administration would not cooperate with the committee's request, saying it "has no legitimate role" to investigate the president. In addition, the top White House lawyer said the request was overreach by politically motivated lawmakers.
More: White House says Congress has no 'legitimate role' in investigating Trump, rejects document demands
Recently, the Trump administration has repeatedly stonewalled multiple requests from lawmakers for various types of information.
The House Judiciary Committee last week voted to hold the attorney general in contempt of Congress after Barr refused to comply with a subpoena that called for an unredacted copy of special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation report and its underlying evidence.
House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md. , however, told reporters Wednesday that a vote in the House to hold Barr in contempt will not happen this month.
More: Democrats could hold AG Barr in contempt of Congress. What is that and can it actually be used?
Last week, Speaker Pelosi joked that she would put administration officials that do not comply with subpoenas in a "jail down in the basement of the Capitol. " According to the Architect of the Capitol, several rooms have been used at various times as detention cells. A room in the basement of the Capitol was used in 1877, according to the Congressional Record. The Capitol Police currently have a holding cell three blocks from the Capitol.
“Let me just say that we do have a jail down in the basement of the Capitol,” Pelosi said recently during an interview at a Washington Post Live event. “But if we were arresting all of the people in the administration, we would have an overcrowded jail situation, and I’m not for that. ”

'Stop Doing That Sh*t' author to speak at Rollins College

Texto completo: Within the span of just a few years, Glasgow native Gary John Bishop went from being an unpublished author to selling a million books. It wasn't by giving up on his dream that Bishop became a success, but through following the same personal philosophy he now shares with the world through his books.
Bishop's latest title and second book, "Stop Doing That Sh*t," will be the focal point of an Orlando Sentinel Unscripted event at Rollins College's Bush Auditorium in Winter Park this Thursday.
During the event, also sponsored by the Writer's Block Bookstore, Bishop will speak about his personal journey as an author, talk about some of his life philosophy and speak to the ideas presented in his latest book.
He said that oftentimes, people work in opposition to what they know are their best interests.
"I went on this mission of really putting together the logic of why a human being would know that there's something they should do and yet they don't," Bishop, who has lived in Central Florida for 25 years, said. "I really feel as if, in this book, I've put together something that will help people have many 'aha' moments in terms of being able to put the pieces together for themselves."
Bishop thinks of the book not as an easy three-step process but as a toolkit that everyday readers can take and use in their own lives. He's read a lot of the Stoic philosophers and more modern existentialists, but said all of the knowledge doesn't add up to much if it doesn't make sense to the average person.
"My problem with philosophy is that it's a little too interested in itself rather than its usefulness," Bishop said. "I'm more interested in where you're struggling in life. Let me show you the way that this might apply to you in such a way that it'll shift your perspective or open up a pathway to new action for you."
With his Scottish roots, Bishop finds that he's sometimes more blunt than readers are willing to stomach and often uses curse words. He said that promoting his first book, "Unfu*k Yourself: Get Out of Your Head and Into Your Life," proved to be tricky. As a self-published author, it was challenging for Bishop to first get his book out in the public sphere with a curse word in the title.
"Shakespeare loved to curse. Not that I'm comparing myself to Shakespeare, but I think there's a lot of poo pooing of cursing that is a little unnecessary," Bishop said. "I think curse words are like the hot sauce of language. When used in the right way, they certainly bring life to an otherwise unappetizing meal."
After the initial challenges in getting his work out there, Bishop became a New York Times bestseller with "Unfu*k Yourself" and has taken pride in making a difference in people's lives, especially while touring to promote his new book. Readers have shared deep personal details of their lives in response to "Stop Doing That Sh*t," sometimes moving themselves and Bishop to tears.
"I don't like making money. Money's awesome," Bishop said. "But I'm really about supporting and helping people. This is about using our lives for a purpose that's greater than ourselves. This is about people."
Ultimately, Bishop draws the wisdom found in his books from philosophers and psychologists, but also through experiences and his deeply held beliefs.
"I really believe that, as human beings, we have this tremendous capacity for life that we are diluting and giving away to circumstances or situations when we really don't need to," Bishop said. "Everything I'm saying in my book is not only what I teach people, but I've walked the pathway myself. Using that kind of outlook has really allowed me to bring a sense of satisfaction, fulfillment and peace of mind to my life that I've really never known until I started on that pathway."
If you go
*Gary John Bishop will speak for the Orlando Sentinel Unscripted event at 7 p.m. Thursday in the Bush Auditorium at Rollins College (1000 Holt Ave. in Winter Park).
*General admission tickets cost $35 and include a pre-signed copy of "Stop Doing That Sh*t."
*Preferred seating with a book access to the signing line at 8 p.m. costs $50. A V.I.P. ticket for a 6 p.m. meet and greet plus book signing and front of room seating costs $75. Find tickets on eventbrite.com.

Texto completo: In a historic change of mind, President Donald Trump has found a reason to support reparations — for President Donald Trump.
The president retweeted this bright and, oh, yes, unconstitutional idea on Sunday after Jerry Falwell Jr., president of Liberty University, proposed that Trump deserved an additional two years in office to make up for the time allegedly lost in the Russia investigation.
I have a counterproposal. I think the president should leave office two years early — as in, right now — to make up for the "executive time" that he reportedly has spent golfing, visiting his personal properties and watching "Fox & Friends" instead of keeping up with his daily intelligence briefings.
Just kidding. Falwell was just kidding, too, I am told. Trump? I'm not so sure.
"Despite the tremendous success that I have had as President," Trump tweeted Sunday, "including perhaps the greatest ECONOMY and most successful first two years of any President in history, they have stolen two years of my (our) presidency (Collusion Delusion) that we will never be able to get back....
"The Witch Hunt is over but we will never forget. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!"
Could this be a sign that the president doesn't expect to win four more years in office by the normal constitutional route?
As Trump's and Falwell's tweets went out, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was warning in a weekend New York Times interview that, even if the president fails to be re-elected in 2020, he won't want to leave — especially if he loses by a narrow margin.
The party needs to "inoculate against that," she said, by not only winning but winning "big" enough to convince Trump to step aside voluntarily, as every other sitting president has.
Pelosi didn't sound like she was kidding at all. Similar fears that Trump would "poison the public mind" and "challenge each of the races," motivated her in last year's midterms, she said. In the end, Democrats picked up a net gain of 40 seats, their biggest gain in the House since the historic post-Watergate wave election of 1974.
She's not the first to speculate about a Trump who won't go away. When comedian Bill Maher floated that notion last year on his HBO program, not as a joke but as a serious concern, my personal reaction was, hey, don't give him any ideas.
Yet Trump has said more than a little to feed the notion himself. In his final 2016 presidential debate with Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, less than a month before Election Day, Trump promised to "totally accept" the election results, "if I win."
Since he did win the Electoral College, Trump's threat went away. But he went on to complain anyway, tweeting blame on some sort of a ghost-voting conspiracy for allegedly robbing him of the popular vote, "if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally."
"In many places the same person in California votes many times," Trump said at the official White House event in West Virginia on tax cuts in April 2018. "They always like to say, 'Oh that's a conspiracy theory.' It's not a conspiracy theory." Again, he offered no evidence to back up that claim.
Speaking at a fundraiser for the National Republican Congressional Committee in April, Trump cast suspicion on the close elections that Democrats won in 2018. "There's something going on," he said, telling his audience that they needed to "be a little bit more paranoid than you are, OK?" Again, he offered no proof to back that up.
And, requiring no proof are the jokes Trump has casually dropped about somehow extending his constitutional term in office. "Well, this is really beautiful," he said, accepting a gift from the Wounded Warrior Project in April. "This will find a permanent place, at least for six years, in the Oval Office. Is that OK? I was going to joke, General, and say at least for 10 or 14 years, but we would cause bedlam if I said that, so we'll say six."
Right. I, too, have an award for the president. It's a copy of a fine old song by Dan Hicks and His Hot Licks: "How Can I Miss You When You Won't Go Away?"
It's got a good beat and he can dance to it.

Texto completo: The Metropolitan Museum of Art announced Wednesday that it will no longer accept donations from the Sackler family of philanthropists who built their fortune from the development and sale of opioids.
The Met's decision comes amid mounting criticism of the Sacklers' role in the opioid crisis. Hundreds of cities, counties and states have filed lawsuits claiming that eight Sackler family members were involved in deceptive marketing practices by the family-owned pharmaceutical company, Purdue Pharma, and its blockbuster painkiller drug, OxyContin.
Three other art institutions - the Tate galleries and National Portrait Gallery in London and the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York - previously announced that they would not accept gifts from the family.
For decades, the Sacklers have supported high-profile cultural and educational institutions around the world - from the Met to Harvard University to the Louvre.
But artists and social media activists have criticized those relationships and called on the institutions to return the Sackler gifts and remove the name from their walls.
In response to protests, the Sackler Trust, one of the family's philanthropic arms, announced in March that it was suspending donations.
The Met's decision affects the branches of the family related to Purdue Pharma. In 1952, Sackler brothers Arthur, Mortimer and Raymond bought a small pharmaceutical company, and in 1987, Mortimer and Raymond bought out Arthur's share after his death. Purdue Pharma was established in 1991.
The Smithsonian Institution has drawn a similar distinction regarding the branches of the family and the source of their wealth. The Smithsonian's Arthur M. Sackler Gallery opened in 1987, months after its benefactor died and years before OxyContin came on the market. Arthur Sackler donated 1,000 objects and $4 million to the museum, and the Smithsonian is contractually bound to keep the family name on the Asian art museum, according to a spokeswoman, who added that future donations are not in the works.
"We have no plans to approach any member of the Sackler family for a donation," spokeswoman Linda St. Thomas said Wednesday, repeating the response from March, when the Guggenheim made its announcement.
Arthur's widow and Smithsonian donor Jillian Sackler has repeatedly said her husband had no role in the opioid crisis.
"It is a gross injustice to blame [Arthur]," she said in a statement earlier this year. "Not a penny of his philanthropy derived from the sale of OxyContin, and it is a disservice to the institutions he founded to suggest otherwise."
The Met said that its decision came after a months-long review of its gift policies, prompted by the public outcry over the Sackler gifts. The decision was first reported by the New York Times.
"Private philanthropy literally built The Metropolitan Museum of Art," Met president and chief executive Daniel Weiss said in a statement. "What distinguishes our Museum from its global peers, such as the Prado, the Hermitage, and the Louvre, is the fact that we did not begin with a royal or imperial collection. Every object and much of the building itself came from individuals driven by a love for art and the spirit of philanthropy.
"For this reason, it is our responsibility to ensure that the public is aware of the diligence that we take to generate philanthropic support. Our donors deserve this, and the public should expect it."
The Sackler donations to the Met - including the gift that funded the wing housing the museum's Temple of Dendur - date back half a century. The museum does not plan to remove the Sackler name.

Texto completo: Ever take the time to read the ingredient list on a bottle of commercial salad dressing? If you’ve learned what I’ve learned, that list may give you pause. If you paused, too, may I suggest that you head to your kitchen where you control the ingredients and make the dressing, as I do? Here’s my story.
Soybean oil is the main oil in almost all commercial salad dressings? I have issues with soybean oil.
Back in the early 1970s, when I was just starting to really explore home cooking, I decided to make mayonnaise since I’d seen it done on a television cooking show (probably Julia) and it didn’t look that difficult.
At that time, my favorite mayonnaise was Hellmann’s. I went to my refrigerator and pulled out a bottle and checked the ingredients: soybean oil, egg, vinegar, salt, sugar and lemon juice. I had everything in my kitchen but soybean oil. I headed to my local health foods store and bought a bottle of natural soybean oil.
When I began preparing my mayonnaise, I should have sensed there was an issue when I opened the soybean oil bottle and the oil didn’t have a light scent; it smelled strongly of plastic.
This oil had a deeper color than other grocery-store vegetable oils. If memory serves, it was a reddish-yellow.
Never having bought or used soybean oil, I didn’t give it another thought.
Undeterred, using my wire whisk, I made my mayonnaise and was impressed at how well it came together. It had mayonnaise’s creamy texture, but the color was yellowish compared to store-bought mayonnaise.
The biggest difference was the flavor. My mayonnaise didn’t smell like Hellmann’s and, honestly, tasted terrible. My inedible mayonnaise experiment hit the trash. I didn’t come back to homemade mayonnaise until about eight years ago when I started making homemade mayonnaise from extra-virgin, cold-pressed organic olive oil — a product then unavailable in stores.
At that time, I worked for an agricultural trading company that, among other agricultural products, sold soybean oil. The oil they sold was called RBD soybean oil. Curious, I asked what RBD meant and was told that meant Refined, Bleached and Deodorized — RBD. Ah, that explained what had happened decades ago. That soybean oil had not been refined, bleached or — importantly — deodorized.
Today, my go-to mayonnaise of choice is made from pure avocado oil (there are at least three brands of 100-percent avocado oil mayonnaise currently available).
Check the avocado oil mayonnaise ingredient list on some commercial mayonnaise and you’ll frequently find they are a blend of avocado oil combined with canola oil and, oh yeah, soybean oil.
A friend of mine told me they stopped buying bottled ranch dressing because of its ingredients, especially soybean oil. Hidden Valley does make an "organic" version of their famous ranch dressing, and I applaud them for that.
For many people. the remainder of the commercial "ranch" salad dressings have possible issues — such as MSG — beyond soybean oil.
Over the years I’ve tried to make a decent homemade ranch-style dressing from different recipes. All failed, mostly due to the out-of-balance herb and spice components. But then I came across one shared by The New York Times and made it my way. Give this a try; you’ll be amazed.

Pete Buttigieg was Facebook’s 287th user. Now he says the company has too much power.

Texto completo: When Pete Buttigieg joined Facebook as a Harvard undergrad in 2004, he was the 287th user registered on the site. The social network’s founders were friends of friends, and it felt like an insular message board for Harvard classmates, he remembered in an interview in San Francisco last week.
“I don’t think any of us could have guessed what implications that technology would have in the long run,” Buttigieg said.
Fifteen years and 2.4 billion users later, as Facebook wrestles with cascading scandals over data privacy, misinformation and election meddling on its platform, Buttigieg has become one of several presidential contenders calling for tougher regulation of the company and Silicon Valley’s other biggest tech firms.
The debate over Facebook’s future took on new resonance last week as one of the company’s co-founders, Chris Hughes, published a New York Times op-ed calling for the tech giant to be broken up. Buttigieg said Hughes, his former Harvard classmate, “made a very convincing case” that no company “should have the type of power that… these tech companies have.”
But unlike Sen. Elizabeth Warren, he hasn’t endorsed breaking up the tech giants, instead suggesting “a spectrum” of regulation that could include fines, blocking new mergers or splitting up companies. That’s attracted criticism from some on the left who want the candidates to take a strong stance on issues of corporate power.
Buttigieg’s vaguer position comes as the 37-year-old mayor of South Bend, Indiana, has courted support from Silicon Valley, attending a packed schedule of fundraisers around the Valley and San Francisco on Friday.
In the first three months of 2019, Buttigieg received at least $27,250 in donations from employees of Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon, the fifth-highest total among the Democrats running for president. Hughes also gave him $2,700 (while donating to several other 2020 Democrats as well). Meanwhile, his campaign has spent about $181,000 on Facebook ads, less than a fifth of the amount spent by Sens. Kamala Harris or Warren.
“Here in the Bay Area, we’ve been waiting for a new generation that is going to redefine politics, and I think Pete’s going to do it,” said Adam Hundt, a tech worker who met Buttigieg in college and co-hosted one of his fundraisers. “Tech is all about change, and the way Pete has an open mind and embraces change makes him a natural fit.”
Buttigieg was two years ahead of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg at the Ivy League school, and was a senior when Zuckerberg, Hughes and their co-founders launched the site from a dorm room. Buttigieg’s account is the 287th on the network (although a few of those before him were created as tests) — if you go to facebook.com/287 while signed into Facebook, the Harvard grad’s original page, which he still updates, will pop up.
At the time, following his friends on Facebook felt like “a curiosity,” and an improvement over services like MySpace, Friendster or AIM, Buttigieg said. In recent years, he’s used his page to share photos from his deployment to Afghanistan in the Navy Reserve and post pictures and videos of life in South Bend. (He has separate pages for his presidential campaign and mayor’s office.)
When Zuckerberg embarked on a cross-country trip to see more of the U.S. in 2017 — attracting rumors about his own presidential ambitions — he stopped by South Bend to meet with Buttigieg, connected by a mutual Harvard friend. The mayor drove the tech mogul on a tour of the city, as Zuckerberg streamed live video from his cell phone on the dashboard of Buttigieg’s car.
Zuckerberg and Buttigieg stayed in touch, and they last spoke earlier this year, his campaign said.
As Buttigieg explained to Zuckerberg on the tour, he’s also worked to attract tech investment to his Rust Belt hometown, helping open a data center on the site of an abandoned Studebaker plant and transforming other old factories into glassy work spaces for startups.
“What they’ve done to revitalize the city is pretty remarkable,” marveled Matt Rogers, the co-founder of the smart home company Nest and an investor who’s been to the city multiple times at the mayor’s invitation. “You go out to dinner in South Bend and the streets are full of millennials, and there are great restaurants that feel like you’re in San Francisco.”
Rogers, who’s hosted fundraisers for Buttigieg, said he found the candidate to be “literate, fluent and deeply knowledgeable” about tech issues.
Buttigieg has suggested that that tech know-how is missing in D.C. He criticized the congressional hearings featuring Zuckerberg and other tech executives last year, which he called “political theater where very little actually got achieved.”
“What we saw was a spectacle of people in charge of regulating a very powerful force demonstrating that they had no concept of what it was they were in charge of overseeing — which is incredibly dangerous,” Buttigieg said, arguing that political leaders “need some kind of literacy in these technologies, what they mean and more importantly what they can do, in order to regulate properly.”
“This is not necessarily an age thing, although I think it helps to have grown up with these technologies at your fingertips,” he added.
Meanwhile, Buttigieg has toed the line between criticizing tech companies and voicing a more sympathetic perspective.
He said Friday that “a lot of people here in the tech sector still have a David mentality when they’ve increasingly turned into Goliath.” But he added that he believes tech companies are making policy decisions “perhaps, not necessarily with bad intentions,” and said he was struck by how many of Silicon Valley’s executives have “become very introspective” and are “really reflecting on what they wrought.”
That more diplomatic approach — and Buttigieg’s avoidance so far of calling for breaking up companies like Facebook — “has been a personal sigh of relief for a lot of people in the tech industry,” said Jacob Helberg, a tech policy advisor who’s hosted fundraisers for the candidate.
While most of the other top Democrats are also playing coy on the issue, Buttigieg’s refusal to be pinned down has frustrated tech critics who see it as a defining debate in the party.
“He is going for Silicon Valley money and he wants to express some nod to the problems but he doesn’t want to offend anyone powerful,” said Matt Stoller, a fellow at the Open Markets Institute and an advocate of splitting up the tech giants. “Take a position.”
------------
WHAT OTHER DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES SAY ABOUT BREAKING UP BIG TECH COMPANIES
Support it:
Sen. Elizabeth Warren: “Today’s big tech companies have too much power — too much power over our economy, our society, and our democracy. They’ve bulldozed competition, used our private information for profit, and tilted the playing field against everyone else… That’s why my administration will make big, structural changes to the tech sector to promote more competition — including breaking up Amazon, Facebook, and Google.”
Rep. Tulsi Gabbard: “Absolute power corrupts absolutely. I agree with Senator Warren on the need to break up big tech companies like Facebook, Google, Amazon. Will be introducing similar legislation in U.S. House.”
On the fence:
Former Vice President Joe Biden: Breaking up Facebook is “something we should take a really hard look at,” he told the Associated Press, saying Warren “has a very strong case to be made.”
Sen. Kamala Harris: “We have to seriously take a look at that… [Facebook] is essentially a utility that has gone unregulated. And as far as I’m concerned, that’s got to stop.”
Sen. Bernie Sanders: “We are living in an era of monopolies that dominate every aspect of our lives — including our government. It’s time to take that power back.”
Voiced concerns about it:
Sen. Cory Booker: “I don’t think that a president should be running around pointing at companies and saying breaking them up without any kind of process here. It’s not me and my own personal opinion about going after folks. That sounds more like a Donald Trump thing to say, ‘I’m going to break up you guys.’”
Former Rep. Beto O’Rourke: “I’m not sure if having five more Facebooks — if you broke up Facebook into five component parts, or any of these other large social media or technology companies — makes as much sense as regulating them.”

An MIT dean foretold the admissions scandal, before experiencing her own disgrace

Texto completo: After the college admissions scandal broke in March, with all the allegations about rich and famous parents resorting to lies and bribes to get their kids into elite colleges, I found myself thinking about Marilee Jones.
You may not remember Jones, but she was the subject of a different admissions-related scandal that dominated the news around here a dozen years ago. As the longtime dean of admissions at MIT, Jones had won considerable fame in higher-ed circles. She coauthored a book, Less Stress, More Success, and became what The New York Times called “the guru of the movement to tame the college admissions frenzy." Along the way, she attracted national media coverage for her crusade to make the college application process less stressful — and return some joy to the teenage years. Among the changes she made to the MIT undergraduate application: adding the question “tell us about something you do for the pleasure of it" and reducing the number of spaces for extracurricular activities, from 10 to six.
For Jones, everything came crashing down in the spring of 2007, when MIT asked her to resign after learning she had fabricated her educational background nearly three decades earlier. She had claimed to have undergraduate and graduate degrees from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Union College, and Albany Medical College, when in fact she had earned just one degree: a bachelor's from the College of Saint Rose in Albany.
After the headlines faded and the crews from Inside Edition backed out of her driveway, Jones disappeared from public view as she tried to sort out what had happened — and who she really was. Her crusade largely disappeared as well, swallowed up by her personal scandal. That was too bad, since she had sounded an important alarm.
Her critique went like this: Elite colleges, fixated on keeping their U.S. News & World Report rankings high, worked hard to boost the number of applications they received, knowing that would increase the number of rejection letters they sent out, making them appear more selective. Parents, desperate for bragging rights in their circles, were sending their kids a message that anything less than an elite acceptance letter constituted failure. With the stakes becoming impossibly high and the odds vanishingly low, Jones warned, more and more kids and parents would try to game the system.
When I catch up with Jones this spring after the Varsity Blues scandal has just broken, she is working as dean of admissions and college counseling at a private high school in New Jersey and running a private college counseling service. As much as she had been warning about student stress when she worked in college admissions, she says she has a much deeper appreciation for the problem now that she is working directly with high schoolers.
“All the adults in their life are demanding perfection from these kids," Jones says. “They don't feel like who they are is good enough." They feel the pressure to present themselves as something more.
This is where she feels she can be especially useful, turning her own painful downfall into a cautionary tale. “If I've learned anything," she says, “it's the importance of authenticity."
Jones describes an exchange she had after noticing exaggerations in a student's college essay.
“This isn't the truth," she told the student.
“Well, it's sort of the truth," the student replied.
If you don't take that out, Jones said, “you're signaling to yourself that you're not good enough. I totally get that. That's what I did. But, let me tell you, it never helps."
Back in 2007, before her lies were exposed, things could not have been going better for Jones professionally. Yet she was a mess physically. She and her husband had separated, and she was suffering from debilitating episodes of arrhythmia, which her doctor attributed to stress. One day her newly installed boss called. Someone had told him she was passing herself off as a PhD. Was it true? Jones denied it, explaining that people sometimes introduced her at conferences as “Dr. Marilee Jones," and she didn't feel it appropriate to correct them.
“After I hung up the phone," she recalls, “I knew I had falsified my résumé. I went down the hall to see him. I took advantage of the moment. That was it. I told him."
Her boss was angry, she says, and her career was in tatters. She drove home in a daze, she says, and had to tell her estranged husband about this decades-long lie he knew nothing about. “But within an hour of getting home, my arrhythmia was gone."
The whole ordeal, she says, was a self-inflicted hell, but she's ultimately grateful for it. “It saved my health, for sure. And it gave me my life back."
She is now working to earn her master's degree through the University of Texas's online program. She plans to stick with it until she's earned her doctorate. That way, if someone at a conference someday introduces her as “Dr. Jones," all she'll need to do is smile with pride.

Texto completo: University of California, Irvine, law professor Leah Litman wrote in the New York Times on Monday that this week’s Supreme Court decision Franchise Tax Board of California v. Hyatt, by simply overturning a 1979 precedent, paves the way to the reversal of the Roe v. Wade abortion decision.
As much as I hope Roe is overturned, it would be rather sanguine to place any hope in Litman’s argument. Sufficient refutation already exists in that the Roberts Court, as Jonathan Adler has aptly pointed out, has actually been more respectful of precedent than its predecessors. Stare decisis has never been an absolute for any court — and thank goodness for that.
We’re going to hear a lot about stare decisis in coming months — not because it’s an important concept (which it is), but because it’s the last line of defense for Roe.
Litman describes stare decisis as follows:
Under the doctrine, justices shouldn’t overrule an earlier ruling unless several things are true: The decision is unworkable and has generated inconsistent results; it rests on outdated facts; and it represents an outdated mode of legal thinking. The court is also not supposed to overrule precedent where parties have relied on the decision to structure their lives.
She goes on to assert that these conditions all recommend against reversing Roe in particular, even if the justices believe (as even Ruth Bader Ginsburg does, according to her previous writings) that the original decision was a poor one.
What first caught my nonlawyer’s eye was Litman’s dubious deployment of the concept behind the phrase “structured their lives.” Specifically, she wrote this: “Women who have structured their lives around being able to decide when and whether to have a child should take note” of this week’s decision.
It’s very hard to believe that “structuring one’s life” in this context is supposed to refer to the potential status of future decisions. The idea of “structuring one’s life” implies that there have already been irrevocable past decisions — say, large business investments based on longstanding interpretations of the law, which a sudden Supreme Court reversal could abruptly reduce to nothing. The idea that abortion might be restricted or banned in some jurisdictions years from now is nothing like that.
Although Litman evidently disagrees, it should also be a given that Roe is based on outdated law. That Ginsburg and other serious pro-choice scholars would openly disparage Roe is a clear tell. It may have been outmoded even when it was written, but it’s probably generous to plan an ad hoc decision.
As for outdated facts, that’s even more obvious. The current justices need only look to the text of Roe itself, because the 1973 decision more or less invites its own reversal at some future date:
We need not resolve the difficult question of when life begins. When those trained in the respective disciplines of medicine, philosophy, and theology are unable to arrive at any consensus, the judiciary, at this point in the development of man's knowledge, is not in a position to speculate as to the answer.
Setting aside the strongest argument against Roe — its dubious constitutional reasoning — we can still agree that 46 years of “the development of human knowledge” in medicine and biology have passed since Roe was decided. A lot more is known and observed today about the humanity of the unborn, and the point of what the court called “viability” keeps moving earlier into pregnancy as medicine advances.
Even adopting the same premises as the Roe court, reasonable people might infer from the new facts that we should not dismiss the state’s interest in protecting prenatal life as lightly as the Roe court did.
Roe openly presents itself as balancing various rights and state interests after giving them what seemed at the time like an appropriate weight. But given new information, that balance might have to change. The greatest disrespect toward stability and precedent in law would not be to overturn Roe, but to treat it as an immutable commandment carved into a tablet of stone.

Comey’s turn as an above-it-all martyr draws intense criticism from former deputy AG

Texto completo: Don't look now, but former deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and former FBI Director James Comey are in a shouting war.
If I were to pick a side, it would be Rosenstein's. He is not the aggressor. He is also not wrong.
At a gathering of the Greater Baltimore Committee Monday evening, the former deputy attorney general, at last unburdened by office, fired back at the White House critic, claiming the fired FBI chief is a hack posturing as an above-it-all martyr to score lucrative gigs on the anti-Trump resistance circuit.
"[T]he former director is a partisan pundit, selling books and earning speaking fees while speculating about the strength of my character and the fate of my immortal soul," said Rosenstein, who announced his resignation in April as deputy attorney general. "That is disappointing. Speculating about souls is not a job for police and prosecutors. Generally, we base our opinions on eyewitness testimony."
His remarks are in reference specifically to a New York Times op-ed Comey authored titled, “How Trump Co-opts Leaders Like Bill Barr.” The former FBI director writes that “proximity to an amoral leader reveals something depressing. I think that’s at least part of what we’ve seen with Bill Barr and Rod Rosenstein.”
Comey adds, “Accomplished people lacking inner strength can’t resist the compromises necessary to survive Mr. Trump and that adds up to something they will never recover from. It takes character like Mr. Mattis’s to avoid the damage, because Mr. Trump eats your soul in small bites.”
This sort of thing is par for the course for Comey. Since he was sacked from the FBI in 2017, he has refashioned himself as a supposedly principles-driven anti-Trump critic. Never mind that whereas the Left was burning Comey in effigy 2016 for making Trump president, he has suddenly gained widespread acceptance and friendship by taking this path. Also, never mind that Comey’s constant running of his mouth has also landed him well-paying speaking gigs and a memoir book deal that netted him more than $2 million.
It is not great that a former head of the Justice Department would spar publicly with a former head of the FBI. But I also do not fault Rosenstein. This has been a long time coming for Comey, whose sniping from the sidelines has made it harder for people like Rosenstein to do their jobs.
[Read: James Comey reacts to Rod Rosenstein calling him a 'partisan pundit': 'I wish him the best']
On Monday, Rosenstein said he "did not dislike" Comey in the past. In fact, he added, he “admired” him! But that started to change around the time Comey announced there would be no charges brought against Hillary Clinton for maintaining an unauthorized homebrew email server when she was secretary of state, Rosenstein said, characterizing the ex-FBI chief’s handling of the investigation as a career-defining mistake.
"The clearest mistake was the director’s decision to hold a press conference about an open case, reveal his recommendation, and discuss details about the investigation without the consent of the prosecutors and the attorney general," Rosenstein told the Greater Baltimore Committee. "Then, he chose to send a letter to the Congress on the eve of the election stating that one of the candidates was under criminal investigation, expecting it to be released immediately to the public."
It is worth noting here that the FBI was instructed explicitly by former Attorney General Loretta Lynch’s Justice Department not to charge Clinton with "gross negligence,” which was the FBI’s chief charge, according to congressional testimony provided by a former bureau attorney. Obviously that reflects poorly on the Obama administration, but it also implies new levels of snake-like behavior on Comey's part. Was he attempting to go over Lynch's head in a passive-aggressive fashion when he gave his infamous presser, clearly demonstrating Clinton's guilt and then abruptly changing gears to announce she would not be prosecuted?
Rosenstein continued Monday, saying, "My soul and character are pretty much the same today as they were two years ago. I took a few hits and made some enemies during my time in the arena, but I held my ground and made a lot of friends. And thanks to them, I think I made the right calls on the things that mattered.”
It's not great for the country to see such a public spat between former heads of agencies that trade on trust and credibility. But Rosenstein has a right to respond — and show me the lie in what he said.

HEARD AROUND THE WEST

Texto completo: WYOMING
The headline in The New York Times didn't pull any punches: "Sorry, Insta-grammers, you are ruining Wyoming." Tourists who post "geotagging photographs" on social media are drawing crowds of people to beautiful places that used to be remote, said Brian Modena, a member of the Jackson Hole Travel and Tourism Board. "We want people to have a real connection to nature," he said, "not just a page with a pin on it." The board suggests that visitors cease their bragging and use a generic location tag: "Tag Responsibly, Keep Jackson Hole Wild."
CALIFORNIA
The relationship between Southern California's humans and their coyote neighbors has been "more than a little strained" over the past few years, reports Atlas Obscura, largely owing to the coyotes' diet. Sometimes the menu consists of food from garbage cans, but now and then somebody's pet goes missing. To pin down exactly what coyotes eat, National Park Service ecologist Justin Brown trained volunteers to act as "poop scouts." Searchers were taught to look at the ground for "links about the size of their thumbs, with tapered ends." Back in the lab, researchers put the coyote scat into panty hose, washed it, and then baked it to kill parasites before analyzing what was left behind. Atlas Obscura says more than 3,200 samples have now been studied, revealing that LA's coyotes definitely enjoy feasting on domestic cats, as well as fruit from ornamental trees like figs, rabbits, gophers and insects and human food leftovers. Coyotes are not dainty eaters; they gulp their food whole, Brown said, and unlikely aperitifs like work gloves, a condom, shoelaces and "plenty of packaging" turned up in some scat. Residents are naturally unhappy when coyotes bite them or devour their pets, but as the researchers noted, "Coyotes are living pretty much everywhere, and a lot of them aren't causing conflicts." Where they do get into trouble, say researchers, it's important to "control their food sources."
COLORADO
If you're ever in Grand Junction, Colorado - at some 60,000 people, the biggest city on the Western Slope - check out its garbage trucks, street sweepers, dump trucks and buses, because every vehicle is run on human poop. Anaerobic digestion starts breaking down the organic matter at the Persigo Wastewater Plant. Then the raw biogas the plant produces is collected and turned into renewable natural gas, or biometh-ane, which can then be used for electricity, heat or fuel for vehicles. The result, as the Guardian reported back in 2016, is "like finding a diamond in the sludge," especially compared to the old method of "simply flaring off the raw gas into the atmosphere" or burning diesel or gasoline. Don Tonello, who recently retired as wastewater services manager for the city, said the Persigo plant may be the only one in the nation that powers its vehicles with biomethane. The biomethane is produced during the night, and vehicles fill up their tanks for the next morning. In less than a decade, the project, worth $2.8 million, is expected to pay for itself.
It's a different story in Weld County, in the northeastern part of Colorado. Though its Heartland Biogas plant, a $115 million anaerobic digester, does an efficient job of turning cattle manure and food waste into renewable biogas, some rural residents say the operation stinks - literally. In fact, the county shut down the plant, reports the Coloradoan, after some 600 complaints about dizziness, headaches and the nasty smell of "scorched manure." The company says it's working to solve the odor problem, but in its defense claims that "about 10 people made most of the (complaints)." Heartland Biogas has been in operation since 2015 and has contracts with Sacramento, California, as well as Weld County.
ALASKA
"They'll never be able to link it to us," crowed poacher Andrew Renner, 41, to his son Owen, 18, of Wasilla, Alaska. They'd gone out to Esther Island in Prince William Sound to kill a hibernating black bear, confidently assuming no one would ever discover their crime. Unfortunately for them, a government stop-motion camera caught their every move. The poachers shot a mother bear in her den and after her two panicked cubs began bawling, the men slaughtered them as well. The video shows the two men in front of the den, high-living their bloody hands, reports the Washington Post, while one can be heard boasting: "We go where we want to kill shit." The Post notes: "Had it not been for the camera, the duo's illegal hunting - and efforts to cover up what they had done - would not have led to criminal charges last year." Faced with the video evidence gathered by the Alaska Department of Fish and Game and the U.S. Forest Service, the men pleaded guilty to unlawful killing of the bears. Andrew Renner was sentenced to three months in jail, fined $9,000, and his hunting license was revoked for 10 years. His son's license was suspended for two years, and he was required to do community service. An Alaskan assistant attorney general called the case "the most egregious bear cub poaching case his office has ever seen."

Losing income tax privacy is a real danger: Ron Paul

Autor: Paul, Ron.

Texto completo: Last week the New York Times published some of President Trump’s 1980s and 1990s tax return information.
The information detailed President Trump’s financial difficulties during that time. While you would not know it from reading some media reports, this is old news. In fact, President Trump openly discussed his financial difficulties on his popular reality television show.
What should be of great concern is the possibility that the person who leaked the returns — who the paper says has legal access to President Trump’s tax records — is an IRS employee seeking to undermine the president. This would hardly be the first time an IRS employee has leaked confidential information because he disagreed with the taxpayer’s politics. In 2014 the agency had to pay the National Organization for Marriage $50,000 dollars after an IRS employee gave names of the group’s donors to the group’s opponents.
In 2014-2017, my Campaign for Liberty group was repeatedly threatened by the IRS because it refused to give the agency the names of and other information about its top supporters. Fortunately, the IRS rescinded the regulation forcing groups like Campaign for Liberty to violate supporters’ privacy or face legal penalties. However, campaign finance reform legislation that recently passed in the House of Representatives would require the IRS to resume collecting this information, and the New York attorney general is suing the IRS to force the agency to reinstate the regulation.
The right of groups like Campaign for Liberty to protect their supporters’ privacy was upheld by the Supreme Court in NAACP v. Alabama. As Justice John Marshall Harlan wrote, “Inviolability of privacy in group association may in many circumstances be indispensable to preservation of freedom of association, particularly where a group espouses dissident beliefs.”
Traditionally, presidents have used the IRS to harass their political opponents instead of presidents’ opponents using the IRS against them. Franklin Roosevelt audited people critical of the New Deal and supportive of the America First movement. Lyndon Johnson ordered audits of opponents, and John Kennedy shared tax return information with Washington Post editor Ben Bradlee.
During the Obama administration, the IRS targeted groups opposing Obamacare. The agency went after anti-Iraq War groups during the George W. Bush years.
If the Times did obtain Trump’s tax returns information from an IRS employee, that employee is not in the same category as whistleblowers like Edward Snowden or Chelsea Manning who exposed government wrongdoing. The leaker or leakers of President Trump’s information are releasing private tax information.
The IRS regularly violates the civil liberties of taxpayers. In fact, the income tax system forcing taxpayers to reveal potentially incriminating information on their tax returns violates the principles of a free society. Americans’ liberty and prosperity will never be secure until Congress repeals two great mistakes of 1913: the income tax and the Federal Reserve.
Dr. Ron Paul is a former member of the House of Representatives. This article was written for and published by the Ron Paul Institute for Peace and Prosperity.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON.— Teresa Todd recuerda bien cuando se detuvo en una zona desértica en Texas a ayudar a tres hermanos que habían sido abandonados por su grupo . Su gesto de buena samaritana le costó una breve detención, pero ahora lucha para que el Congreso modifique las leyes y no castigue a personas que rescaten a migrantes .
Todd es abogada de la ciudad fronteriza de Marfa y del condado de Jeff Davis, en Texas, situados en un altiplano del desierto chihuahuense.
Durante una noche fría en febrero pasado se detuvo a ayudar a tres jóvenes salvadoreños que fueron abandonados por su grupo porque la más joven, Esmeralda, se enfermó y no podían avanzar .
En entrevista telefónica con Noticias Telemundo, Todd explicó este lunes que sólo pensó en su hijo menor cuando vio las figuras pidiendo auxilio en un lugar tan aislado y obscuro, y su instinto materno la obligó a actuar .
“Creo que paré en parte porque soy madre de dos adolescentes, de 17 y 15 años, y el joven que corrió delante de mi coche era casi del mismo tamaño que mi hijo menor. Les pedí que se subieran a mi coche, y poco después llegó la Patrulla Fronteriza y me advirtió de que podrían enjuiciarme ” por transportar a inmigrantes indocumentados, explicó.
Todd pasó 45 minutos en una celda y un total de tres horas en detención. Varios días después, agentes federales, con orden de cateo en mano, llegaron a la alcaldía a confiscarle su teléfono. Se lo devolvieron 53 días después, causando enormes interrupciones en su trabajo.
“Mucha gente se molestó conmigo porque no les devolvía las llamadas, y en ese teléfono tengo mucha información privilegiada de mis clientes. Como abogada, claro, me causó muchos problemas”, se quejó Todd, cuyo caso salió a luz pública el viernes pasado en un artículo del diario The New York Times.
Desde entonces, su oficina no deja de recibir llamadas, y en las redes sociales la mayoría de los comentarios son para elogiar y respaldarla.
Los tres jóvenes, Carlos, Francisco y Esmeralda, formaban parte de un grupo de diez personas cuando cruzaron el Río Bravo. Al parecer, llevaban seis días caminando y ya habían agotado sus raciones de comida y agua cuando Esmeralda, de 18 años, presentó graves síntomas de deshidratación.
Todos siguen bajo custodia de la Oficina de Inmigración y Aduanas, aún cuando han solicitado asilo. Su caso se complica porque los dos hermanos presuntamente firmaron documentos que, según ICE, autorizan su “autodeportación” .
Dan Domínguez, alguacil del Condado Presidio, cercano a Marfa, ha dicho a la prensa que, a su juicio, Todd debería ser sometida a juicio porque, sin importar su gesto humanitario, “la ley es la ley” .
Es que, según el código penal, las autoridades federales pueden presentar cargos criminales contra personas que, a sabiendas, intenten transportar a inmigrantes indocumentados más allá de los puntos fronterizos, los oculten u ofrezcan albergue.
Una vez declaradas culpables, esas personas suelen afrontar una multa y sentencia carcelaria .
Según datos oficiales, entre 2015 y 2018, el número de personas acusadas por contrabando y dar refugio a inmigrantes indocumentados aumentó en casi un tercio, de 3,441 a 4,532 .
En abril de 2017, bajo el entonces fiscal general, Jeff Sessions, la Administración Trump instruyó a los fiscales en todo EEUU a que dieran máxima prioridad a enjuiciar a quienes faciliten los cruces ilegales, o trasladen y den albergue a al menos tres migrantes indocumentados.
Otros casos similares al incidente con Todd en la franja fronteriza también han tenido amplia cobertura mediática, como el de activistas en Arizona, del grupo “No More Deaths/No Más Muertes”, que en enero pasado fueron condenados por proveer agua y comida a migrantes en zonas desérticas.
En California, activistas del grupo “Border Angels”, que desde hace 20 años dejan ropa, comida y bidones de agua para los migrantes en el desierto, han sido objeto de críticas de grupos anti-inmigrantes.
Mientras Todd presiona para que el Congreso modifique las leyes migratorias, la abogada expresó esperanza en que los jóvenes que atendió aquella noche puedan obtener asilo.
Cuando Todd se enteró de que Francisco “agradeció a Dios primero, y después a esa señora” que los rescató de una muerte casi segura, la abogada no hizo más que ponerse a llorar , dijo.
“Tengo dos trabajos y dos hijos, pero estoy intentando hacer todo lo que pueda por ayudar en esto… nuestro tiempo juntos fue muy breve esa noche, pero me conmueve mucho su caso y espero que consigan asilo para quedarse en EEUU, porque está claro que sus vidas correrían peligro si son devueltos” a El Salvador, puntualizó Todd.

Top Obama adviser: Biden in ‘candidate protection program’ as aides work to avoid gaffes

Texto completo: Former President Barack Obama’s chief campaign strategist David Axelrod said that Joe Biden’s campaign seems to be trying to protect him from making gaffes or appearing to be too old for the presidency.
Axelrod told the New York Times that he thought the campaign’s strategy of insulating Biden from the press and holding back the famously garrulous former vice president from making any controversial remarks has worked so far, but said the campaign will have to pivot to allow him to be “more venturesome” with his remarks and appearances.
“I think they’ve been really, really adroit in the early going,” Axelrod said. “Clearly, they’re trying to do enough to show the flag but not so much that it exposes him to either mistakes or fatigue. But the pace is going to quicken as the race goes on and you can’t keep him in candidate protection program.”
“One of the tests for a guy who’s 76 years old is, ‘Can he handle this?’” Axelrod said, of Biden needing to be more out in the open and visible on the campaign trail.
The 76-year-old has a history of gaffes and actions that have faced criticism. Multiple women have accused him of being too touchy with them, evoking criticism from some #MeToo activists. He later joked about the criticism.
The Washington Examiner reported that a month after the 1988 presidential election, Biden joked about the infamous “Willie Horton” ad, which was widely seen as racist. Biden also referred former segregationist Republican Sen. Strom Thurmond “one of my closest friends.”
Biden has a wide lead in the polls among the more than 20 candidates running for the Democratic nomination. A RealClearPolitics national average of polls has Biden at 41.4% support.

NYT lawyer who took on Trump to speak

Texto completo: Back when I was a city editor, two of my best reporters were eager to find out whether school system employees had taken Jefferson County Public Schools television sets home with them.
My guys proposed showing up at the suspected culprits' front doors, claiming to be telephone service men. Once inside, they explained, it would be a simple thing to ask for a drink of water and, while the cooperative homeowner was in the kitchen, check the back of the living room TV for a JCPS tag.
The first thing I did was call our newspaper's lawyer, Jon Fleischaker, and ask, "Is that legal?" He pointed out that, given the lie necessary to gain access, it could be trespass.
Besides, it just didn't sound very ethical. We didn't do it.
Journalists and their lawyers sometimes end up in high-profile conflicts with a paper's reputation at risk, with millions of dollars on the line or even with jail time in prospect.
I once waited at the back of an Indiana courtroom while Fleischaker persuaded a cranky trial judge not to put us all behind bars. Jon emerged from chambers after about an hour and whispered, "OK, let's get out of here."
Jon Fleischaker's counterpart at the New York Times is David McCraw, the Tuesday Kentucky Author Forum headliner, whose new book "Truth in our Times" is a rich read.
You may remember the McCraw letter responding to Donald Trump's lawyers, who demanded that The Times retract a story about two women who complained about unwanted Trump touches.
McCraw's response went viral. It's an iconic document.
Like Fleischaker, McCraw has seen it as his mission to help put good stories into print, not to squelch them or retract them.
Both of these veteran media attorneys fight to see truth published, for the same reason that our founders put the First Amendment first in the Bill of Rights.
The stakes can be very high (see, Pentagon Papers case), but American media law is based on a bedrock belief that, in McCraw's words, "despite the screw-ups and failures and perceived or real bias of America's press, we are all better off with an independent press allowed to make mistakes than a Ministry of Truth in Washington."
First Amendment lawyers also go on the offensive by fighting to open secret meetings and closed records, in which public officials try to hide misdeeds.
Some of Fleischaker's greatest victories for the public, and the newspaper, have come in opening such things as closed foundation files at the University of Louisville (they said we'd never get them) and forcing open Frankfort records that hid tragic mishandling of child protection cases (the state improbably claimed they didn't exist).
As McCraw recalls, "It felt inevitable: The Trump presidency was barely a half-year old, and I was suing the administration over a tweet" from Trump about his decision to cut off secret CIA spending of more than $1 billion. President Trump himself spilled the beans, but the agency claimed it couldn't afford to turn loose relevant documents.
McCraw's conclusion: "Secrecy breeds absurdity. That is never truer than in litigating against those masters of secrecy run amok, the CIA."
"Truth in our Times" is an easy read ... almost chatty, despite all the big names and big issues. For Obama haters, there's plenty about the Times' troubles with that administration too.
Given my own career at the Courier Journal, it will be no surprise that I was gripped by McCraw's account of the first Trump-era libel suit, filed by six companies owned by coal baron Bob Murray (see, any good search engine for the sordid history). That suit went nowhere.
Where the recent troubling history of attacks against respected media like the Times will lead is anybody's guess. Where Trump himself is going — or when, or even whether, he's going anywhere — is anybody's guess.
However, reading McCraw's book is certain to leave you better prepared to understand the march of events.

Texto completo: A 72-year-old French explorer completed a four-month long trip across the Atlantic in a large orange barrel using only ocean currents, he announced on his Facebook page and in an interview with the New York Times.
Jean-Jacques Savin started his journey from El Hierro in the Canary Islands of Spain in December inside a 10-foot-long, 7-foot-wide barrel. After being at sea for 122 days, the ocean’s currents dropped him in the Caribbean Sea, and a Dutch oil tanker pulled him to the tiny island of St. Eustatius. A few days later, he made his way to Martinique.
He originally planned to reach his destination in three months, he told the New York Times. The barrel was equipped with a bed, kitchen, storage space, as well as porthole on the floor for viewing marine life below.
In addition to freeze-dried food, AFP News Agency reported that Savin brought along a bottle of Sauternes white wine and foie gras to celebrate New Year's Eve and a bottle of Saint-Émilion red wine for his 72nd birthday, which passed in January while he was in the barrel.
Savin, a former military paratrooper, described the challenge on his website as "a crossing where the man would not be captain of his boat, but passenger of the Ocean. "

He spent his days swimming, catching fish, replying to messages, cooking, reading and writing a book slated to be published in August, he told The Times.
"The time at sea passed very quickly," he said.
He noted, "I decided to do this. I had the need for solitude. It was my desire to leave and to be alone. "
The explorer reported on his Facebook page that he spotted mahi-mahi, dolphins, swordfish and other exotic fish during his journey. He also stated that he “went 4 months without meat. "
Savin said there were two times he feared for his life: once after an oil tanker got close to him and another time when a large ship came near.
"The most difficult moment, though, was during my arrival. I was moving quickly with a strong wind, and I was afraid I was going to run aground on the reefs. Again, luckily, the American Coast Guard was always watching me," he said.

For decades, famous Republicans campaigned by decrying the way we allow welfare cheats, food stamp scammers and all sorts of tax dodgers and deadbeats to take advantage of our government programs funded by America’s hardworking taxpayers.
Indeed, Ronald Reagan campaigned for years by warning us about a “welfare queen.” She was never identified, probably just a trope; but many Americans were sure they knew her type — they unfairly figured she was probably working her scams in some tax-funded public housing project. At a 1976 campaign rally, Reagan regaled us about how well she was living off our taxpayer dollars: “She used 80 names, 30 addresses, 15 telephone numbers to collect food stamps, Social Security, veterans’ benefits for four nonexistent deceased veteran husbands, as well as welfare. Her tax-free cash income alone has been running $150,000 a year.”
Fast-forward to today: President Donald Trump has called for reforming welfare, food stamps (now called SNAP), and other taxpayer-funded aid programs. Here’s why: “People are taking advantage of the system.” And he hates when that happens.
Today, we’ll start by focusing on two other classic case histories: One is a perp who was actually living in our public housing when he pulled his little scam. The other got away with gaming the system for years — and coincidentally wound up living in that same public housing project. Maybe you know the place: It’s a very old, but still-serviceable, two-story white building at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, in Washington, D.C.
Rewind to 1969: President Richard Nixon discovered a way he could pay virtually no income taxes as president — by donating his pre-presidential papers to the government and claiming it as a tax-deduction. But then he found the provision had just been cancelled and he missed the deadline. No problem: A notary donation deed was illegally backdated to April 21, 1969, so it would look legal. But then Nixon’s caper was caught — he paid the Internal Revenue Service a big fine and an aide took the rap and went to jail.
Then, in 1974, Nixon paid another price when questioned about it in a primetime press conference by Newsday’s then-young journalist (whom I coincidentally just saw in my bathroom mirror this morning): “Mr. President ... April 21, 1969, was a significant day for you in taxes and for the country, too. That is the notary date on the deed that allowed you to give your (pre-presidential) papers to the government and pay token taxes just for two years.
“On that same date, you had a tax reform message in which you said, and I quote: ‘Special preferences in the law permit far too many Americans to pay less than their fair share of taxes. Too many others bear too much of the tax burden.’
“Now, Mr. President, do you think you paid your fair share of taxes?”
Of course Nixon didn’t pay his fair share. And of course he never said so that night. He just said he’d taken the deduction at the suggestion of the (conveniently) recently deceased former President Lyndon Johnson. No doubt every tax-paying American reading this column has paid more than their president paid a half century ago.
Fast-forward again: This Wednesday, we learned we all also paid more federal income taxes than a mega-rich Donald Trump did during eight years in the 1980s and 1990s. The New York Times reported that Trump paid no income taxes for those years because his businesses lost a whopping $1.7 billion in those years — more than virtually any other American lost.
So now we need to ask yet another president: “Do you think you paid your fair share?”
Apparently, Trump just gave us his answer. He tweeted that he took advantage of our cockamamie tax laws that allowed real estate tycoons to claim losses, and pay no taxes, while you and I paid, bigtime!
Trump’s tweet made no pretense of contending zero was his fair share (while he enjoyed his usual luxurious life in his mansions, penthouses and private jet). He played the game by the rules lawyers and lobbyists wrote, and Congress meekly passed. As @realDonaldTrump tweeted: “Real estate developers in the 1980’s & 1990’s, more than 30 years ago, were entitled to massive write offs and depreciation which would, if one was actively building, show losses and tax losses in almost all cases. Much was non monetary. Sometimes considered “tax shelter,” ... you would get it by building, or even buying. You always wanted to show losses for tax purposes .... almost all real estate developers did — and often re-negotiate with banks, it was sport.”
Not a crime. Just a sport.
Not fair. Just fake.
Not Congress in action. Just inaction.
And the bleat goes on.

Texto completo: Over three days of hearings last month, Elaine Wynn looked on stoically as Massachusetts regulators grilled Wynn Resorts executives about her ex-husband's alleged sexual offenses, a litany of accusations that drove the casino mogul out of the business.
The details were painful, exhausting. For Elaine Wynn, surely, the long hours of testimony must have been doubly difficult. It raised the obvious question: Why was she doing this at all?
She could have avoided it all easily enough by selling off most or all of her shares in Wynn Resorts, the Las Vegas company she cofounded with Steve Wynn in 2002. But no, she told the Massachusetts Gaming Commission, she's not going anywhere.
“I'm here because I am team Wynn," she said.
Her resolve to stick it out reflects her devotion to the firm that has her name, her friends say.
“Elaine cares about the company and her people, about the legacy of that organization," said Mellody Hobson, president of Ariel Investments in Chicago and a longtime friend of Wynn.
Wynn is a top company shareholder, with a 9 percent stake worth about $1.3 billion.
Her long career includes a 1999 induction into the American Gaming Association's Gaming Hall of Fame. She was number nine last year on the Forbes list of “America's Richest Self-Made Women." For her accumulated knowledge and mentoring, Wynn has earned a special status among women at the highest levels of US businesses, Hobson said.
“The joke among our friends is we call her our godmother," Hobson said. “A godmother is someone looking out for you, who is nurturing and supporting you. I have a bunch of friends and that's what we call her."
Wynn, 77, has also been called the Queen of Las Vegas. Now, with the imminent debut of the company's Encore Boston Harbor resort casino, she is about to become part of the local civic landscape, too.
On Monday, she was at the Celtics playoff game at TD Garden. The Celtics were bad, but it is a good bet Wynn will be back. She is, in her own words, “a crazed basketball fanatic." She sits on the board of governors for the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, in Springfield.
The Encore Boston Harbor, the first Las Vegas-style casino in Greater Boston, is set to open in about six weeks. It is the largest single-phased private development in state history, a $2.6 billion resort hotel on the Mystic River in Everett, stuffed with more than 3,000 slot machines, an array of table games, event space, 671 hotel rooms and suites, and 15 new bars and restaurants. The Encore will employ some 5,500 people and is expected to draw millions of customers annually, ensuring it will have a strong pull on the cultural gravity of the region.
State regulators last month ruled that Wynn Resorts could retain its Massachusetts casino license, though they fined the company $35 million after state investigators found that former executives covered up misconduct allegations against Steve Wynn.
Steve Wynn left the company and sold his Wynn Resorts stock early last year, after The Wall Street Journal reported in January 2018 that he had been accused of a pattern of misconduct. He has denied any nonconsensual sexual relationships.
Elaine Wynn declined to be interviewed for this story but told The New York Times last May, “My mission is to resurrect the integrity of this extraordinary company that is really the capstone of my professional life."
Sallie Krawcheck, cofounder and CEO of the investment company Ellevest and former chief executive of both Smith Barney and Merrill Lynch Wealth Management, said Elaine Wynn “is, for generations of women, really iconic."
“She continues to be in the game every day, and she was part of creating a valuable company," Krawcheck said. “As I look toward extending my career through decades, she's a great role model and example."
Elaine Wynn was born in New York City and graduated from George Washington University with a degree in political science. She married Steve Wynn in 1963, when she was 21. They divorced in 1986 and then remarried in 1991. They cofounded Wynn Resorts in 2002, and Elaine Wynn served on the company's board of directors until 2015. The couple divorced again in 2010, and Steve Wynn married his current wife, Andrea Hissom, in 2011.
Elaine Wynn testified in April before the Gaming Commission because it needed to assess her fitness to hold a position of influence in a casino. Much of the questioning revolved around a $7.5 million settlement Steve Wynn paid in 2005 to a former manicurist at Wynn Resorts who had accused him of rape.
In 2009, during Steve and Elaine Wynn's second divorce, one of Elaine Wynn's lawyers received an e-mail from a woman who alleged that Steve Wynn had raped her stepdaughter and had signed a multimillion-dollar settlement with her, state investigators found. Elaine Wynn told investigators that reading that e-mail was “one of the single most upsetting things that's ever happened to me."
She said she confronted her husband, who denied the accusation and suggested he had been blackmailed. She said she reported the accusation in 2009 to the company's general counsel.
Elaine Wynn did not tell the board of directors at the time but later raised the existence of the settlement in litigation with the company in 2016.
The Wall Street Journal revealed the nature of the settlement in 2018.
The Gaming Commission, while affirming Elaine Wynn is suitable to be a major shareholder in the company, said certain aspects of her behavior raised concerns. Her failure to inform the board of directors or state regulators about the rape allegation and settlement was “particularly troubling," the board wrote in its report. “The various conflicting facts she learned concerning whether the event was consensual and Ms. Wynn's reaction thereto showed a concerning lack of diligence to further investigate or address an extremely troubling event."
The commission concluded, however, that while Wynn could have done more to instigate an investigation into the allegation, she was not legally obligated to do so.

Texto completo: At his contentious hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Attorney General William Barr dropped a big hint about his investigation into the conduct of the Trump-Russia investigation.
"Many people seem to assume that the only intelligence collection that occurred was a single confidential informant and a FISA warrant," Barr said. "I would like to find out whether that is, in fact, true. It strikes me as a fairly anemic effort if that was the counterintelligence effort designed to stop the threat as it is being represented."
Here is what he meant: There has been a lot of discussion on the right about the FBI’s use of a confidential informant, an England-based college professor named Stefan Halper, to spy on some Trump campaign figures, including the sometime foreign policy volunteer advisers George Papadopoulos and Carter Page. There has also been talk about the FBI’s use of a so-called FISA warrant — a court-approved permission to wiretap — against Page.
There was also speculation about other possible FBI surveillance, but the Halper operation and Page FISA case were the only ones definitely known. So Barr was saying that if the FBI really took the Trump-Russia matter seriously, if they thought it was a threat to the republic, would that be all they would do? No other wiretaps or other surveillance? No other confidential informants? Nothing?
Given that Barr was already looking into the question, his phrasing suggested he suspected there was more.
Sure enough, just days later, The New York Times reported that in the summer of 2016 the FBI sent an undercover agent, a woman who went by the alias Azra Turk, to London to pose as Halper’s research assistant and tease information out of Papadopoulos. (The Times was so reluctant to call Turk a spy that it referred to her, in a headline, as a "cloaked investigator.") So now there are Halper, Turk and the Page FISA warrant. If they represent the totality of the FBI’s surveillance, that would still be a pretty anemic response to what some in the bureau viewed as a full-scale Russian attack on American democracy.
So the key question of the Barr investigation will be: Is there more? The answer is not publicly known. But consider this: The Mueller report noted that on Aug. 2, 2017, the Justice Department authorized the special counsel to investigate specific allegations against four Trump campaign officials: Page and Papadopoulos, plus former campaign chairman Paul Manafort and former security adviser Michael Flynn. Is it reasonable to believe that the FBI pulled out the big investigative guns, the spies and the wiretap warrant, against the two smaller figures — Page and Papadopoulos — and not against the far more important figures of Manafort and Flynn? Or if not against them, perhaps against others?
It wasn’t that long ago, on April 10, when, during another Hill appearance, Barr set off a firestorm by declaring that "spying did occur" on the Trump campaign. Democrats pounced; how dare Barr call the FBI’s investigation "spying"?
"Perpetuating conspiracy theories is beneath the office of attorney general," tweeted Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer.
It is abundantly clear that Barr was correct. He was careful to add that the unknown factor about the spying was "whether it was adequately predicated" — that is, whether the FBI had a legitimate reason to do it. But there was no doubt that spying happened.
Now, the question is whether there was more than is now publicly known. Congressional investigators are anxiously awaiting the results of an investigation into at least some of the surveillance by Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz. That report is thought to be coming in the next couple of months. They are also watching to see what Barr will investigate on his own.
Both are deeply important efforts. Just as the public needed to know what is in the Mueller report, it needs to know about the FBI’s secret political operations in the 2016 campaign.

In our opinion: In the 150 years since the golden spike, we hope we're not done praying

Texto completo: “We have got done praying. The spike is about to be presented.”
That was the Morse code statement wired from near Promontory Summit, Utah, to cities nationwide on May 10, 1869, only moments before the final blows came and, as The New York Times put it the next day, “the continent was spanned with iron.”
The prayer referred to was one offered by the Rev. John Todd of Pittsfield, Massachusetts. In it, he gave God credit for the work that captivated the nation’s attention and would mean so much to its future. “We rejoice that thou hast created the human mind with its power of invention, its capacity of expansion, and its guardian of success,” he said, adding, “... thou hast brought this mighty enterprise, combining the commerce of the East with the gold of the West to so glorious a completion.”
Many people in the 19th century saw God’s hand in the scientific and engineering marvels that were transforming their world quickly and in ways more dramatic even than what the 21st century’s rapid pace of invention is bringing. Modern Americans would do well to adopt that same attitude of thanksgiving. The proof of divine blessing lies in a backward glance over the changes of the past 150 years, and the nation needs it going forward.
Friday marks the sesquicentennial of that momentous day. It is not only proper, but encouraging, that the moment and its lessons will be remembered and celebrated, and that the workers who made it happen will be honored.
The completion of the transcontinental railroad was, in many ways, a symbol of what America was coming to stand for, even in spite of its failures and prejudices. In the crude, politically incorrect language of the day, the Chicago Tribune described this:
“The Occident and Orient, North and South, Saxon, Celt, Mongolian, each clad in his peculiar costume, met and mingled on common ground. All personal and sectional animosities, all distinctions of class, all prejudices, race and nationality were forgotten for the moment …”
Great accomplishments requiring teamwork can enoble, build pride and tear down walls of prejudice. That is another lesson to be taken from that day. America is at its best when it sets aside differences and works together.
It’s easy in today’s world of smart devices and rapid travel to forget how excited someone in the mid-19th century would have been over the way the world was shrinking. In the two decades preceding the golden spike ceremony, the telegraph had made instant long-range communication possible, railroad expansion had enhanced trade and human transportation, and the successful submersion of a transatlantic cable had made it possible to communicate with Europe in a matter of minutes.
Added to this, the transcontinental railroad would unite East and West, end the era of dangerous pioneering treks through the wilderness and begin to help heal the wounds of the just-finished Civil War. Only a few years later, the telephone, the automobile, the electric lightbulb, airplanes, radio, television and the computer would lead to greater prosperity, running on a parallel track with lifesaving medical innovations. A century later, the nation landed men on the moon.
Modern Americans can’t afford to forget that, while the workers who laid the rails 150 years ago may have been primarily concerned with doing a job for money, the entire enterprise was fueled by a faith in mankind’s ability to progress and improve itself. They should not forget to be grateful for a remarkable 150 years.
“O Father, God of our fathers, we desire to acknowledge thy handiwork in this great work,” the Rev. Todd continued in 1869, “and ask thy blessing upon us … that peace may flow ... as a gentle stream, and that this mighty enterprise may be unto us as the Atlantic of thy strength, and the Pacific of thy love.”
Our hope today is that the Morse code message of that day was not true, and that, for the good of the next 150 years, we have not “got done praying.”

Texto completo: Do readers need another memoir from Ruth Reichl?
The former Gourmet editor-in-chief, who is also the former restaurant critic at the New York Times, has published her sixth tale with a focus on her world, "Save Me the Plums: My Gourmet Memoir," her seventh if you count the thinly disguised history found in her earlier novel "Delicious!" about a high-end gourmet magazine that goes under.
In the latest volume, she tells the story of Gourmet magazine wooing her away from the Times for the role at the Cond Nast publication, owned by S.I. Newhouse. Ten years later, in 2009, when the financial market tanked, the monthly magazine shut down and Reichl was out of a job.
Should we expect a memoir from her post-retirement years? Let's hope not.
It may not matter to hard-core fans of the longtime food writer -- especially those who are New York-centric, where her tale unfolds. They will gravitate toward all things Reichl, all the time, and savor the name-dropping of those in the rarefied food world (think David Chang, Eric Ripert, Daniel Boulud and Anthony Bourdain).
But for those of us smitten by her first memoir, "Tender at the Bone," a compelling tale of her earliest years, as well as "For You Mom, Finally," a look at her mother and women of her era, which still offers a lot of Ruth, this latest volume brings one word to mind: enough. As in "you need new material" enough.
Yes, Reichl broke new ground at Gourmet, introducing stories on traditionally non-Gourmet subjects, such as migrant tomato pickers in Florida, not-so-sustainably farm-raised salmon and the cruelty of boiling lobsters alive, which may be of interest to not only food-centric readers of the magazine but to followers of those specific writers.
But at the end of the day, "Save Me the Plums" speaks of the demise of a publication, one in which hundreds of thousands of dollars were flung around like confetti. It's the tale of the Newhouse empire of magazines, dripping in Big Apple excess until the economy and print world plunge into chaos. In the Midwest business world, this would have been considered to be financial irresponsibility. Too harsh? Well, Gourmet (along with many other Newhouse publications) went belly up.
The book reminded me of an article that novelist Ann Patchett wrote for the Wall Street Journal, called "Did I Kill Gourmet Magazine?" which appeared in 2010. In it she speaks of her experience writing for Gourmet for a decade:
"There are no words for how good they were to me. When I was writing a novel about an opera singer who was taken hostage ["Bel Canto"], I told them I really needed to go to Italy to tour the great opera houses. Never mind that the food in opera houses consists of boxed mints and tiny cups of espresso, they were behind me all the way. When I told [travel editor William] Sertl the trip should include Venice, he reminded me that the opera house in Venice had burned to the ground ten years prior. I said that I still thought it was important, you know, spiritually. He understood."
Patchett continued, "Magazine work was a beautiful party and we all just figured it would go on forever. My husband and I took a cruise to the Bahamas. We chartered a sailboat in the Virgin Islands. Seriously, those articles were going to be written anyway. If I hadn't done it they would have hired someone else. For my 40th birthday I asked rather petulantly to be sent somewhere nice. There was a new resort opening in Antigua that needed to be reviewed. I was just the reporter for the job."
Reichl acknowledges as much in the epilogue of the book. "Like every other Cond Nast editor, I'd let Si [Newhouse] tie me up in golden strings. The money, the limos and the clothing allowance were just the beginning: He kept us so thoroughly insulated from ordinary life that for ten years I never balanced a checkbook, made a reservation or knew where I was meant to be at any given moment. Someone was always there to see to the quotidian details, and the job often seemed too comfortable to quit," she writes.
As for the memoir, which should be shelved among business books rather than with food, given its teachable moments, the former editor tells, at length, how she learned to run a magazine, how she fed the 9/11 firefighters, how she expanded the brand, all done in the classic Reichl style, with plenty of conversational quotes and culinary flourishes, along with some surprising clunkers.
For the former: "The scent of fresh oranges perfumed the air, and biscuits baked in the oven. Bacon sizzled in the pan, filling the kitchen with the generous aroma of hickory smoke. The tantalizing promise of coffee and cocoa hovered in the background."
For the latter: " 'This is very good,' Robin breathed as she handed me the thickly embossed invitation."
Enough with the plums, Ruth. We're ready for something new.

Texto completo: With renewed attention to President Donald Trump's taxes, U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst said she thinks the president should voluntarily release his returns.
"I think he should voluntarily release them, yes," Ernst said in response to a reporter's question Wednesday.
Asked why she thought that was important, Ernst responded: "Well, I'm not saying it's important, but I think there are a lot of folks that have stated they want to see them. Now that's up to him, again, voluntarily, I would like to see him do that. But I don't know what bearing that has on whether he's qualified to be president or not."
At a 2017 town hall in Cedar Rapids, Ernst said, "I think he should," in response to a question about the possibility of Trump releasing his tax returns.
She clarified back then that she didn't support legislative efforts to compel the president to do so.
Traditionally, presidential candidates release their tax returns to allow the public to assess their income sources, tax rates and charitable contributions.
Trump resisted the tradition. Many of the horde of Democrats running for presidential this year have already done so.
Ernst's latest remarks come after The New York Times obtained tax information that showed Trump reported losses of more than $1 billion from 1985 to 1994.
They also come as U.S. House Democrats are ramping up their efforts to get more information about the president's tax returns. On Monday, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin refused to release them in response to a request by a Democrat-led committee.
Mnuchin sent a letter to the chair of the House Ways and Means Committee that called the request "unprecedented." Mnuchin added he believes "it presents serious constitutional questions, the resolution of which may have lasting consequences for all taxpayers."

Texto completo: This past spring, I took a six-week course at the OLLI program at California State University, San Bernardino-Palm Desert Campus.
When asked upon exiting the Constitutional Convention, Ben Franklin was asked "Well, what kind of government did you give us?"
His answer was the subject of this letter and the name of the class.
Our Founding Fathers gave us, with that document, as Americans – not Democrats, Republicans, or Independents (like me) – a Democratic Republic with three equal branches of government to provide "checks and balances" when required due to one branch exceeding its constitutional authority.
If there has ever been a time in our history for the people's representatives in both houses to step up as Americans, regardless of party, to protect those rights given us by Jefferson, Madison, etc., it is now.
If they choose to abrogate that power, they may do so for all time ending the kind of government those brilliant minds gave us at Philadelphia so many years ago.

Who is E.J. Dionne? I was enlightened by a recent letter, "Who is Marc Thiessen?," May 5.
While there are enough obvious "tells" in Marc A. Thiessen's writing to show that he's a conservative, I was not aware of his extreme right-wing bonafides until the letter laid them out for me. So, Thiessen worked for Jesse Helms, Donald Rumsfeld, Roger Stone AND Paul Manafort? That's quite a résumé.
But it left me thinking: How much did I know about progressive E.J. Dionne? So, I looked.
Here's Dionne's résumé: Graduated from Harvard University, was a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford. Best-selling author since 1991. Respected journalist (Washington Post, New York Times). Married, three kids. Wears glasses.
That's quite a résumé. So, yes, I agree with that earlier letter writer that we should judge words with the full knowledge of the person using them.

No comparison to Watergate People try to compare the Russia investigation and President Donald Trump's actions with Watergate and Richard Nixon's crimes. Similarities aside, the two were different in one very significant way.
Members of Richard Nixon's party did not turn their backs on our Constitution, our morality or the rule of law. Their primary concern, as true patriots, was the welfare of our country and the survival of the greatest Democracy in the world.

Celebrating the First Trans-Atlantic Flight. Not That One.

Texto completo: [What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox .]
The first trans-Atlantic flight? Lindbergh seems the obvious answer. But that would be wrong.
Yes, Charles A. Lindbergh belongs in the history books -- for the first nonstop, solo flight across the Atlantic.
But note the words nonstop and solo. Lindbergh was not the first aviator to cross the Atlantic Ocean. His record-setting achievement was flying to Europe alone in the cockpit without stopping.
So, who got there first? Six Navy and Coast Guard crewmen in 1919, eight years before him. Their mammoth seaplane, known as the NC-4, left Rockaway Beach in Queens 100 years ago Wednesday.
Theirs was no nonstop flight -- they stopped in several places along the way for repairs and refueling -- and the going was slow. Lindbergh made the trip in less than a day and a half. They took almost three weeks. At every stop, they had to wait for parts to be delivered or bad weather to clear before they could take off again.
At the time, what they accomplished was front-page news, including in The New York Times. But unlike the Wright brothers or Amelia Earhart later on, the NC-4 and its crew have been largely forgotten.
"This was lost to history, eclipsed by Lindbergh," said Robert Schwach, a retired New York City police lieutenant. "It just didn't seem fair."
Mr. Schwach -- the deputy chief of staff for Eric Ulrich, a City Council member whose district includes the Rockaways -- has made remembering the NC-4 a mission. He has assembled an exhibition about the NC-4 at the T7 Gallery at Fort Tilden, a former Army base near where the NC-4 took off. The exhibit will open on Wednesday after a ceremony at nearby Riis Landing at 10 a.m., the hour at which the plane lurched across Jamaica Bay and climbed into the sky.
"The goal, really, is to bring the whole story out of history's shadow," Mr. Schwach said.
The story is one of a plane that looked like a mash-up of the Wright brothers' Kitty Hawk and a ship. The NC-4 had biplane wings atop a boat-shaped wooden hull. Its 126-foot wingspan was nine feet longer than that of a modern Airbus A320.
The NC-4 took off with two similar planes, the NC-1 and the NC-3. They had been planned as reconnaissance aircraft to fly over the water, looking for German U-boats, in World War I. But the armistice had been declared before the planes were ready to go.
The Navy, with an assistant secretary named Franklin D. Roosevelt cheering the effort, decided to fly the planes to Europe -- and into the record books. Roosevelt had taken a nine-minute ride in another NC plane, the NC-2, during a visit to the Rockaways in April 1919. The NC-2 was dismantled soon after. Components of the NC-2 went into the NC-1, which had been damaged during a storm in Jamaica Bay.
By then, the race was on for the first trans-Atlantic flight. The Daily Mail, in London, was offering a prize of 10,000 pounds, equivalent to about $ 670,000 in 2019. Military aviators were not eligible; the contest was open only to private fliers.
But the Navy's sights were set on a place in history, and the Navy deployed its resources in case there was trouble. A string of destroyers moved into positions along the route, each about 50 miles from the next -- close enough, officials hoped, to handle rapid rescues, if necessary.
For the NC-1 and the NC-3, the first leg of the flight was uneventful. They arrived in Halifax, Nova Scotia, as planned, about 10 hours after leaving Queens.
But the NC-4 went down in the waters off Cape Cod, only a couple of hours after leaving Queens. One engine had radiator trouble; another exploded. The NC-4 could not fly on the two remaining engines, but it could sail. "They acted as a boat, basically, using the engine to push them in the water" to the naval air station in Chatham, Mass., Mr. Schwach said. There, mechanics got the engines working again.
Between the repairs and bad weather, the crew had to wait six days before departing for Halifax on the morning of May 14.
Later that day, the NC-4 had propeller problems. Mr. Schwach credits someone who was just along for the ride -- not officially a member of the crew -- with requisitioning ship propellers that were adapted for the NC-4: Richard E. Byrd, then a junior Navy officer who had been working on navigational methods and equipment for the NC seaplanes. He became famous a few years later as a polar explorer.
From Halifax, the NC-4 flew to Trepassey, Newfoundland, where it caught up with the NC-1 and the NC-3 -- and Byrd disembarked. "From Newfoundland on was the longest leg," Mr. Schwach said, "and they needed the least amount of weight."
The NC-1 and the NC-3 went down in the water after leaving Newfoundland and were damaged; the crews were rescued. But the NC-4 kept going, though it did not make it to the planned landing spot in the Azores, the islands in the North Atlantic off Portugal.
It got only as far as Horta, in the central Azores, about 175 miles west of Ponta Delgada, where the pilots had planned to land. Bad weather forced another delay -- three more days of waiting out the rain and the clouds before making the two-hour flight to Ponta Delgada.
It flew to its destination, Lisbon, on May 27. Later it flew to Plymouth, England, and the crew took a train to London, where the commanding officer, Lt. Comdr. A. C. Read, met Winston Churchill and the Prince of Wales.
"Within the U.S., my sense is there was a lot of pride in the NC-4's accomplishment," said Laurence M. Burke II, a curator at the National Air and Space Museum in Washington.
But Dr. Burke added that "the broader perception" was that the NC-4 was overshadowed by two British aviators who won The Daily Mail's prize a few weeks later and, eventually, by Lindbergh.
"The NC-4 is harder to understand because they didn't do it nonstop," he said. "Where are your goal posts, basically? Lindbergh, he started here, he ended there."
With the NC-4, Dr. Burke said, "Do you date the crossing from New York to London, or Canada to Portugal?" (The NC-4 is now on display at the National Naval Aviation Museum in Pensacola, Fla.)
Mr. Schwach, 51, heard about the NC-4 from his father, Howard Schwach, who served in the Navy during the Vietnam War, on an aircraft carrier in the Mediterranean. Howard Schwach read up on naval aviation in the ship's library and remembered the story of the NC-4 later, after he retired as a middle-school teacher and became the editor of a weekly newspaper in the Rockaways.
Mr. Schwach put the exhibit together with a $ 7,000 City Council appropriation to the Queens Historical Society and help from the Rockaway Artists Alliance. He has already booked a number of school field trips to see the posters, photographs and small model of the NC-4 that he has installed in the gallery. He does not expect long lines at the door.
"I realize that this is not competing with a Van Gogh exhibit," said Mr. Schwach, who was in charge of a police unit responsible for handling crowds before he retired. "I don't have any delusions that we're going to need my crowd-control expertise to fight people back."

Anti-Semitism bill goes where a law shouldn't; sun-sentinel editorial

Texto completo: Although Gov. Ron DeSantis might hesitate to veto any bill that the House and Senate passed unanimously, the 32 Jewish Floridians who asked him to reject anti-Semitism legislation (HB 741) gave him good reasons why he should.
It goes too far. As they pointed out, some of its provisions confuse anti-Semitism with criticism of Israel. That has profound constitutional problems, as the bill is plainly meant to be enforced throughout Florida's public schools, colleges and universities. The staff report on HB 741 remarked on the constitutional issue, noting that "the United States Supreme Court has emphasized that the First Amendment right to free speech includes a right to make hate speech."
Much contemporary criticism of Israel indeed is animated by anti-Semitism, from the left as well as the right, and it is reprehensible.
And anti-Semitism, in all its ugly aspects, is on the rise. According to the FBI, hate crimes against Jewish people and institutions increased by 37 percent from 2016 to 2017, followed by lethal mass shootings six months apart at synagogues in Pittsburgh and near San Diego.
In Florida, Jewish centers have had bomb threats and Jewish sites have been vandalized with painted swastikas. Some of the public posts to an online article on the HB 741 controversy were the vilest anti-Semitism imaginable.
But HB 741 is about more than that. It makes the State of Florida a party to an intense debate among American Jews over policies of the Israeli government that, to some, violate ethical principles of their faith and foreclose the possibility of a fair and peaceful permanent resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian dispute.
J-Street, a pro-peace Jewish lobby in the U.S., criticized the bill as seemingly intended to "crack down on campus critics of Israel" rather than the "xenophobic, white nationalist far right."
"At a time when we should be welcoming and valuing open debate on issues of social concern," said the Floridians' letter to DeSantis, "HB 741 is a heavy-handed attempt to silence public criticism of the Israeli government's human rights violations. Agree or disagree with the critics, the Florida Legislature has no business intruding on those discussions. Additionally, the accusation that such criticism is anti-Semitic does a disservice to the real issues of anti-Semitism that should concern all of us today."
The letter objected also to citing only anti-Semitism as an example of religious discrimination, and it accused bill sponsor Rep. Randy Fine, R-Brevard, of intending to "punish critics of the Israeli government." Fine, who has been a firebrand on the issue, validated the critics' opinion of him in his response to Florida Politics. He dismissed them as 32 Jews out of 700,000 in Florida who "don't want to ensure their own children and grandchildren be protected in school..."
The 32 signers include two well-known South Florida constitutional lawyers, Alan Levine and Benjamin Waxman, and two rabbis.
The legislation amends Florida's Educational Equality Act which requires equal access and prevents discrimination against students and employees in Florida's K-20 public education programs. It adds religion to the existing prohibitions against discrimination on grounds of race, ethnicity, national origin, gender, disability and marital status.
So far, so good. That would protect people of all faiths, including Islam.
But then it deals explicitly and only with defining anti-Semitism. The exclusion of other bigotries, such as anti-Islamic prejudice, occasioned a bitter debate in the House.
The bill requires educational institutions to treat anti-Semitism in "an identical manner to discrimination motivated by race." A student accused of anti-Semitism could be disciplined or expelled. A teacher or professor could be fired, entirely on the basis of constitutionally dubious language
Among other things, HB 741 cites these supposed examples of anti-Semitism:
"Accusing Jewish citizens of being more loyal to Israel, or the alleged priorities of Jews worldwide, than to the interest of their own nations...
." (D)rawing comparisons of contemporary Israeli policy to that of the Nazis...
"Applying a double standard to Israel by requiring behavior of Israel that is not expected or demanded of any other democratic nation, or focusing peace or human rights investigations only on Israel...
"Delegitimizing Israel by denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination and denying Israel the right to exist..."
It attempts to qualify those metrics by saying that criticism of Israel, similar to criticism of other countries, isn't anti-Semitic, and to say that none of the language "shall be construed to diminish or infringe" upon any First Amendment right.
But that still leaves too much to someone's judgment. It is not the government's business to control what people might say about any issue, let alone one so consequential and emotional as the long search for an elusive peace in a land sacred to three religions.
The dubious definitions come largely from a document adopted in 2005 by the European Monitoring Center on Racism and Xenophobia and later by the U.S. Department of State. The lead author was Kenneth S. Stern, former director on anti-Semitism for the American Jewish Committee.
But Stern opposes their use in educational settings because they were meant only as guidelines for research and diplomacy. The staff report made the Legislature aware of that.
In a December 2016 New York Times op-ed, Stern wrote that congressional attempts to write them into U.S. law were aimed directly at the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement against Israel, which has traction on many college campuses. At best, he said, "students and faculty members will be scared into silence, and administrators will err on the side of suppressing or censoring speech."
"Rather than suppressing speech about the conflict," he concluded, "we should be encouraging it. How else will students learn?"

Texto completo: Valley News Columnist
Friends of Half and Susanne Zantop aren’t persuaded by Jim Parker’s argument that after 18 years in prison, he’s been punished enough and no longer poses a threat to society.
New Hampshire Associate Attorney General Jeffery Strelzin has heard from about a half-dozen people who oppose Parker’s court motion for early release. The AG’s Office also has been in touch with the Zantops’ daughters, Veronika and Mariana.
“They oppose (Parker’s) request for a sentence reduction,” Strelzin told me in response to an email that I sent him on Monday.
The letters and statements will become part of Parker’s sentence reduction hearing scheduled for Aug. 2 in Grafton Superior Court in North Haverhill.
Parker, now 34, is asking a judge to suspend the final seven years of the 25-year minimum sentence he received for his role in the murders of the Zantops in January 2001. Parker and his Chelsea schoolmate, Robert Tulloch, knocked on the Zantops’ front door in Etna on a Saturday morning, pretending to be conducting an environmental survey for school.
“This was not a crime of a robbery by rebellious teens, selling drugs, or even of a purposeful or an accidental shooting in the course of a robbery, which might invite leniency or reconsideration of sentence length after substantial jail time,” wrote Carol Bardenstein, an associate professor of Arabic language and culture at the University of Michigan, who became friends with the Zantops while teaching at Dartmouth in the 1980s.
Instead, this was a “cold-blooded, pre-meditated, thrill-kill murder,” added Bardenstein, who sent me a copy of her letter last Friday.
Annelise Orleck, a Dartmouth history professor, wrote in her letter that she was “not a believer in vengeance. I would support early release for the many people currently in prison for victimless crimes, and even some in jail for nonviolent crimes.
“James Parker’s crime was neither victimless nor nonviolent. Far from it. Nor was it a spontaneous crime, committed without forethought.”
She added, “I understand that Parker’s family loves him and wants him to go free. I am glad that Parker has been a constructive presence in his prison community. But this can’t be only about him. Not today. Not ever.”
Alexis Jetter, a Dartmouth lecturer in English and creative writing, also shared her letter with me. “What would stop James Parker from killing again?” she asked. “A man who needs no motive can easily kill again.”
Not surprisingly, the state isn’t going along with Parker’s early-release request.
“What the Zantops experienced has to be worth far more than the few years (Parker) has served and should serve in prison for what he willingly did to them,” Strelzin wrote in his court filings.
Everyone agrees the murders of Dartmouth professors Half and Susanne Zantop were about as savage and senseless as crimes get.
But where the disagreement begins — and what a judge will decide — is whether Parker’s 18 years in the New Hampshire State Prison is sufficient punishment and his rehabilitation has reached a point where he’s ready to re-enter society.
As I wrote on Sunday, court documents filed by Parker’s attorney, Cathy Green, of Manchester, indicate that Parker has made good use of his time behind bars. He’s earned a master’s degree and improved the quality of life for other inmates through his art, theater and music projects.
More important, a psychological evaluation that assessed Parker’s risk for future criminal behavior put him at the “very low end for risk of violent behavior and reoffending.”
Parker was 16 when he killed Susanne Zantop. Adolescent brain research has come a long way since Parker was sentenced to 25 years to life after pleading guilty to second-degree murder.
Studies show “adolescents often lack the ability to make mature judgments, control their impulses and consider the consequences of their actions,” the American Psychological Association reported in its “Justice for Teens” journal article in 2017.
The U.S. Supreme Court found in its 2012 decision, Miller v. Alabama, that mandatory life-without-parole sentences for juvenile homicide offenders violated the Constitution’s ban on cruel and unusual punishment. In 2016, the court made the ruling retroactive for more than 2,000 inmates already sentenced, including Tulloch, who pleaded guilty to first-degree murder for the killing of Half Zantop.
As a result of the Supreme Court ruling, Tulloch, who was 17 at the time of the murders, will have his life-without-parole sentence reviewed during a three-day court hearing in December.
Parker’s sentence wasn’t nearly as severe as life-without-parole, but recent advances in adolescent brain research seem to bolster his case for early release. (Under New Hampshire law, an offender who has served two-thirds of his minimum can ask the court to suspend the remainder of his sentence.)
Laurence Steinberg, a Temple University psychology professor and co-author of Rethinking Juvenile Justice, wrote an op-ed for The New York Times in 2015 that I think could apply to Parker’s case.
Wrote Steinberg, “It’s important to note that this debate is not about whether juveniles should be excused from criminal responsibility. Juveniles know right from wrong, should be held responsible for their behavior and should face consequences when they violate the law.
“The question is whether the way we respond to a juvenile who commits a serious crime should differ from how we respond when the same crime is committed by an adult.”
In my view, the answer is yes. There’s no excuse for Parker’s brutal crime, but other than vengeance, what we will gain from his continued incarceration?

Comey team may have used confidential sources prematurely, ex-FBI intel official says

Texto completo: A former FBI official says former FBI Director James Comey's team may have run afoul of "strict guidelines" in its counterintelligence investigation of the Trump campaign during the 2016 election.
Kevin Brock, former assistant director of intelligence at the FBI, wrote an op-ed for The Hill in which he said Comey is "in trouble and he knows it."
Although Comey asserts he did nothing wrong, Brock says the incoming reports from U.S. Attorney John Huber and Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz, as well as an assessment by Attorney General William Barr, may say different.
He focused part of the piece on the bureau's use of confidential human sources to make contact with members of President Trump's campaign who had suspicious ties to Russia.
"Without diving into the weeds, it’s important to understand that FBI counterintelligence investigations generally proceed sequentially from what is called a 'preliminary investigation or inquiry' (PI) to a 'full investigation' (FI). To move from a PI to an FI requires substantial information — predication — indicating investigative targets acted as agents of a foreign power," Brock wrote.
"This is problematic for Comey in light of Mueller’s findings," Brock said, referring to the recently completed investigation conducted by special counsel Robert Mueller.
"There are strict guidelines governing when the FBI can task a confidential source or a government undercover operative to collect against a U.S. citizen. Normally this is restricted to an FI, and normally restricted to the United States, not overseas," he said. "There is a sense that Comey’s team was not checking the boxes, did not have adequate predication, and may have tasked sources before an investigation was even officially opened. Barr should pull case files and dig in on this."
The FBI launched its original counterintelligence investigation, called Crossfire Hurricane, in July 2016. It was prompted by Australian diplomat Alexander Downer informing the U.S. government that Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos told him Russia had "dirt" on Hillary Clinton, Trump's Democratic rival in the 2016 election.
The FBI had multiple confidential sources make contact with members of Trump's team, including Cambridge professor Stefan Halper and a woman posing as his assistant, Azra Turk, who met with Papadopoulos and asked him about the Russians. Horowitz is looking into whether Halper, who also met with other Trump campaign officials, exceeded his mandate.
Furthermore, text messages from former FBI agent Peter Strzok, referred to the intelligence community inspector general this week by two GOP senators, indicate that he believed the CIA was leaking to the media about the Trump campaign and suspicious ties to the Russians and was involved in the investigation far earlier than previously known.
In recent weeks, Comey has spoken out, denying Barr's assertion that "spying did occur" on the Trump campaign. He wrote in a New York Times op-ed that Trump's "amoral" leadership has corrupted Barr and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. He is also set to appear in a CNN town hall on Thursday, exactly two years after Trump fired him as FBI director.
Trump said in a recent Fox News interview that Comey "probably was one of the people leading the effort on spying" on his 2016 campaign.

Comics 'divided' on Louis C.K. show

Texto completo: The last time Louis C.K. was in the Twin Cities, he made an unannounced appearance at one of his favorite venues, Acme Comedy Co., showing his support for the club, which was then in a war of words with a nearby parking lot developer.
"The place is gonna close, so I figured I'd get one more in at Acme," he told a bowled-over crowd in 2016, just after wrapping a sold-out show at Target Center. "When this place closes it'll be a Bennigan's or a Sunglass Hut."
Nearly three years later, Acme is healthier than ever; C.K.'s career is another matter.
When the comedian returns to the club Tuesday for eight shows over four nights it will be in the wake of sins that many are not yet ready to forgive.
C.K. admitted in late 2017 that he had previously engaged in sexual misconduct, specifically exposing himself to women who either worked for him or admired him.
"The power I had over these women is that they admired me," C.K. wrote in a public letter, confirming the squeamish stories five victims told the New York Times. "And I wielded that power irresponsibly. I have been remorseful of my actions."
His apology wasn't enough. FX, which aired his critically acclaimed series "Louie," cut all ties with him. His movie, "I Love You, Daddy," was shoved to the back of the shelf. Stand-up was out of the question.
But last September, C.K. came out of hiding for unannounced appearances at New York's Comedy Cellar, the club that's featured in the opening credits of his self-titled sitcom. Many audience members were thrilled; some walked out.
Since then, C.K. has performed throughout the country, usually with just a few days' notice. This week's appearances in Minneapolis were only announced on Saturday. A total of 2,200 tickets for the eight shows sold out in six hours.
But plenty of people responded negatively to the booking on social media, including comedians Nikki Glaser and Laurie Kilmartin, "Welcome to the Dollhouse" actress Heather Matarazzo and "Top Chef" host Padma Lakshmi.
"Buy tickets to someone else," tweeted comic Emily Galati, who has performed at Acme in the past. "There are plenty of comics who haven't sexually assaulted someone who could use your support."
Local comic Kate McCarthy also believes there are better ways that comedy fans could spend their money.
"There's so much other local talent, support them instead!" she said by e-mail.
Other comics have used stage time to show their support and dissent. Last month, Dave Chappelle used part of one late-night set at the Varsity Theater to scold those who want to banish C.K. from the entertainment world, insisting that they've misinterpreted the facts of the case.
In his performance this past Saturday night at the Cedar Cultural Center, Bobcat Goldthwait was scathing in his comments about C.K., specifically ripping him for recent material that ridiculed teenage survivors of the Parkland shooting.
C.K. himself addressed the fallout from that routine during a recent performance in Tampa Bay.
If you want to make people forget that you masturbated in front of someone, "tell a joke about some kids that got shot in school," he said, according to the Tampa Bay Times. "That's worse ... they tend to forget the first thing."
Acme owner Louis Lee was well aware of the debate when C.K.'s people first started discussing a Twin Cities appearance with him seven months ago.
"The comedy community is divided in half," Lee said Sunday. "No matter what I do, you're not going to win."
Lee believes his longtime friend has served his sentence.
"He had three creative outlets: TV, movies and stand-up. Two of the three have been taken away," Lee said. "I partly believe it's not right for me to take away the last creative outlet he's got, even though many other clubs across the country have turned him down. I respect those clubs, but we've got history together. He's paid the price."
C.K. hasn't done a press interview since late 2017 and he couldn't be reached earlier this week for comment. But based on reports from recent performances, he's likely to address the consequences of his sordid actions during his time on the Acme stage. Both fans and detractors will be eager to hear what he has to say.

6 facts about bonds that you need to understand now

Texto completo: Conventional wisdom says bonds zig when stocks zag, smoothing out volatile periods for investors with blended stock-and-bond portfolios.
Yet, last year that didn’t happen. Corporate and government bond indexes dipped with stocks, raising the question: “What good are they, really?”
To answer that, let’s explore some basics – what bonds actually do in portfolios and what makes them tick.
First: Bonds are simply loans. Buying a bond from a government or company means they borrow your money for a fixed period, promising to pay regular interest, and repay your principle at the end. In between, the bond’s value will fluctuate.
Women and work: Why a growing share of women are working or looking for jobs.
Tracking your retirement: Checked your Social Security statement? If not, you should
Second: Interest rates underpin those fluctuations. Bond prices and interest rates sit on opposite ends of a seesaw. When rates rise, bond prices fall – and vice versa. Pretend you own a Treasury bond paying 2% and maturing in 2029. If 10-year Treasury rates subsequently rise to 3%, your bond’s price will decline. Fewer people want to buy it when they can get a 3% interest rate. But, if 10-year Treasury rates instead fall to 1%, your higher-yielding bond becomes more attractive – its price will rise.
Third: For long-term government bonds, the main interest rate driver is future changes in inflation expectations. When everyone expects faster inflation, they’ll demand higher interest rates to offset it.
Corporate bonds have more variables, including the company’s changing creditworthiness and growth prospects. These will influence its ability to repay you later on. In this way, corporate bonds’ and stocks share some similarities – your first clue they don’t always move oppositely. More mathematically, consider correlations: They measure how closely related two assets’ movements are. Identical movement score is 1. 00; exact opposite is -1. 00. What's the correlation between stocks and seven- to 10-year corporate bonds? It's -0. 01. That's almost exactly midway. In other words, corporate bonds zig with stocks almost exactly as often as they zag against them.
Even Treasurys move with stocks more often than commonly thought. Why? Because a “Goldilocks” economy with moderate growth and low inflation, like now, keeps a lid on interest rates. Their correlation with stocks: -0. 28.
Fourth: While the zig-zag effect of bonds helps sometimes, it isn’t what makes them helpful for blended portfolios. What is? Said simply, their wiggles, both up and down, are smaller. If you’re taking big cash flow from your retirement investments, this can be a big deal.
Fifth: The sharp ups and downs stocks bring can make cash flow-planning difficult. A slug of bonds dampen the swings somewhat. The relatively smoother ride means modestly lower long-term returns than 100% stocks. But that trade-off may be worth it for those relying on their investments for living expenses.
Regardless, growth remains important to offset inflation and generate enough future wealth to prevent you from running out of money. So owning too much in bonds becomes hugely risky for those with long future needs. But dampening volatility really does benefit those with shorter time horizons.
From this standpoint, bonds “worked” last year. They fell, but markedly less than stocks. That cushioned the blow somewhat for investors who owned both, while interest payments helped fund folks’ cash flow needs. The Standard & Poor's 500 fell 4. 4% last year, but a broad gauge combining U. S. corporate and government bonds fell just 0. 8%.
Finally: Bonds can rise in basic value. Like stocks, bonds have enjoyed a V-shaped recovery so far this year, thanks to falling long-term interest rates and easing recession worries. Corporate bonds have done particularly well, and their bounce likely slows now. But benign long-term interest rates and strong overall corporate fundamentals point to a fine year for the category overall.
Next week: a closer look at bonds’ risks. Yes, they have them.

Texto completo: President Trump has called the Mueller investigation a "witch hunt" nearly two hundred times on social media alone. Well, the special counsel concluded he was not a witch. After carefully scrutinizing any links between the Russian government and the Trump campaign, Robert Mueller definitively declared "the investigation did not establish that the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities." He didn't do it.
Still, several leading Democrats have called for Trump's impeachment on obstruction-of-justice charges. This is absurd.
The lesson of Watergate, we are told, is that the coverup is always worse than the crime. But in Watergate, there was a crime to cover up. We now know that Trump committed no crime. There was nothing to cover up.
As Mueller put it, "unlike cases in which a subject engages in obstruction of justice to cover up a crime, the evidence we obtained did not establish that the President was involved in an underlying crime related to Russian election interference."
This lack of an "underlying crime" is the source of Trump's justified outrage over the Mueller investigation. Imagine that you were accused of a crime you knew you did not commit, and a special counsel was appointed who spent nearly two years and more than $25 million investigating you. You'd be angry and frustrated. You'd want someone to stand up for you, defend your interests and stop the insanity.
For two years, Trump watched as the investigation dragged on, weighing down his presidency. He had to endure being accused of "treason" and crimes of "a size and scope probably beyond Watergate." He listened as members of the House and Senate intelligence committees, and former intelligence officials, led Americans to believe that they had seen secret evidence showing he had colluded with Russia -- evidence he knew did not exist.
Of course, he wanted the investigation to end. But he didn't end it. He didn't obstruct justice because nothing was obstructed. Mueller was allowed to finish his work. The White House cooperated, sharing millions of pages of documents and giving Mueller access to dozens of senior officials.
The fact that Trump railed against Mueller to aides and told White House counsel Donald McGahn to fire Mueller (which McGahn did not do and Trump did not press the matter) is not evidence of obstruction; it is evidence of exasperation. The president has a right to vent in private to his staff. Remember, the only reason Mueller knew about his private exchanges with McGahn is because Trump put no restrictions on McGahn's cooperation.
The president could have asserted privilege, but declined to do so. He let McGahn spend some 30 hours with Mueller, sharing details, according to The New York Times, "that investigators would not have learned of otherwise." This is evidence of Trump's cooperation, not obstruction.
As a result of this cooperation, the special counsel's report contains some embarrassing moments for the president. But it also proves that Trump was telling the truth when it came to the central question of the investigation: He did not conspire with Russia.
If Democrats want to purse impeachment nonetheless, then to quote Ronald Reagan quoting Clint Eastwood: "Go ahead, make my day." Impeachment over anything other than a conspiracy with Russia will backfire with the American people and help ensure Trump's reelection.
First, it will fail, because two-thirds of the Senate will not vote to convict the president.
Second, Trump's supporters will see an impeachment effort as an attempted coup d'etat, energizing his base ahead of the 2020 election.
And third, it will be seen as partisan and unfair by persuadable voters, who will not appreciate politicians second-guessing the conclusions of an impartial investigation. Want to push Trump's approval above 50 percent? Try to impeach him.
While Democrats debate pursuing impeachment, they are also abusing their powers to get Trump's tax returns in the hope they will provide what the Mueller investigation did not: evidence of something incriminating.
Does anyone really believe that the House Ways and Means Committee wants Trump's returns to assess how "the IRS audits and enforces the Federal tax laws against a president"? Please. There is no legitimate legislative purpose for this request.
Both the Democrats' attempt to misuse a 1920s law to violate Trump's privacy and their partisan response to the Mueller report make clear that they are seeking any pretext to oust Trump. But the only thing they will succeed in doing is eliciting sympathy for an otherwise unsympathetic president.

Texto completo: Long before he became a chef and restaurateur, Jung Hur was an artist. Painting has always been this Seoul native's medium of choice, especially roomy canvases that give him the real estate to explore tangled relationships between opposites.
When I ask him about an enormous abstract that hangs in the stairwell of his new, dual-concept restaurant, N to Tail, he explains that the castanet-shaped figures that appear to launch themselves from the work's meridian - like sparrows frightened from a tree - are actually keyholes.
"My philosophy," Hur says, "is that everybody has their own perspective to look through. We use it to recognize splits: yin and yang, good and bad, cold and hot, magnets have an N and an S, and there's nose and tail, like the name of the restaurant."
Hur's previous business, Fuji, occupied the same Portland building as N to Tail until late 2018, and just like its predecessor, it straddled two floors. That is where the similarities end. With his new restaurant, Hur has gone out of his way to draw bright lines between his past as a sushi chef (both at Fuji and its acclaimed New York predecessor, Kirara) and his current focus on what he calls "Korean food from the mother tongue."
But unwittingly, he has set up a duality of his own, with an upstairs and downstairs that offer two separate menus and two dramatically different dining experiences.
"Would you like Korean cuisine or Korean barbecue?" the staff will ask as you stop at the host stand. Never mind that both technically fall under the rubric of Korean cuisine - this is an important crossroads. Choose wisely.
If you opt for Korean BBQ, you'll be handed short menus and guided back into the vestibule, down the steps and into the recently renovated basement. It's a long, echoing space with concrete floors, a mammoth bar and a surfeit of brick. In the the dining area, you'll find more than a dozen tables outfitted with gas-powered grills and a wall of mirrors etched with the outline of crashing waves. The mirrors don't really make the space feel bigger as much as they reflect the unflattering, bluish bulb light that gives the room the ambiance of a gas station.
Downstairs, if you haven't guessed yet, is the wrong choice.
The charmless atmosphere - something you'd never expect from an aesthetically attuned owner like Hur - is hardly the only turn-off. The noise from other diners is crushing, ramping up exponentially with every added person. Very quickly, you lose the appealing sounds of sliced onions ($3) and eggplant ($4) hissing on the open grill grates, along with the rhythmic popping from fiery droplets of fat whose slowing warns you to grab your chopsticks to retrieve well-seasoned shavings of Korean red-miso-marinated flap meat ($7).
In this room, it is hard to hear anything. On my first visit, the space was less than a third full, but my dinner guests and I still had to shout over the din, thanks to a family at one end and three young men doing sake bombs ($9) at the next table.
"You might want to back up," one bellowed at me as he balanced a shot of sake on a pair of chopsticks laid across the rim of his beer glass. "The last time I did this, I just splashed the whole place. It was like a wet T-shirt contest, and it took me eight of these to get drunk enough."
Admiring his honesty, I did as I was told, and when I heard the sizzle of splattered beer on my table's grill, I was happy I had. Soon after, our server came to alert their party that it was last call. Immediately after they left, she returned to speak with us. "You can have another drink, don't worry," she said. "I just couldn't let that kid chug another beer in six seconds."
While we were grateful for the rescue, I wished she had paid a bit more attention when helping us understand how to use the grill properly. Apart from a curt, "Veggies first, then meat. Keep everything in the center when it's cooking," she offered almost no other guidance. So little, that it wasn't until we flagged her down halfway through the meal that we discovered the savory-sweet condiment we had been using was a maple-soy dipping sauce.
On strongly flavored items like asparagus ($4), sesame-marinated kalbi short rib ($12), and salmon ($6), the sauce was terrific. But beware: Its salinity can easily overwhelm scallops ($8) or paprika-and-butter-rubbed rabbit meat ($13).
Our server also didn't seem to know the menu well. When I ordered a Winter Vegetable Bowl (really just a vegetable bibimbap, $8), she looked at me, confused, then insisted on double-checking that my order did not violate the firewall between upstairs and downstairs dishes.
It didn't, but a few bites into the sparse, largely unseasoned dish, I wished it had. Most disappointingly, it was served in a ceramic bowl rather than a smoldering dolsot, which meant no chance for nurungji (crunchy rice) to develop at the bottom.
"To be honest," my server said as she collected my largely untouched bowl, "the food is a lot better upstairs."
A week later, I was back, and this time opted to remain on the swank, tin-ceilinged upper level when the host inquired, "Korean cuisine or Korean barbecue?"
Here, among a few of Hur's moodier canvases and an abstract light fixture that resembles a box of Kleenex taking flight, I got a bigger shock than I anticipated. Rather than a retread of my clamorous, beer-sprinkled meal, I encountered a whisper-quiet dining room with some of the most exciting, nuanced cooking in Portland today.
In part, that is because this is where Hur expends the majority of his energy. "I can't handle both (menus) myself, so for downstairs, I just control the meat, and people do the rest. Upstairs, everything is controlled by me. Everything," he said.
Drawing inspiration from Seoul's Gyeongsang-do, a Southern Korean pocha-macha (tent restaurant) that specializes in beachy street food, Hur takes a classic recipe for baechujeon (savory cabbage pancake) and tinkers with it, adding potato starch to the buckwheat batter to give it a lighter interior and golden perimeter. He garnishes his version ($8) with a sprinkle of Korean chili powder and a scattering of beet microgreens and serves it with a shallow bowl of ginger-soy dipping sauce. The flavors are at once dusky and alive with spice, crunch and sweetness.
In his riff on another perennial Korean favorite, jjajangmyeon (black bean noodles, $15), Hur largely sticks close to tradition, stir-frying softened onions, zucchini and thumb-sized slices of pork belly together with thick-cut wheat noodles. He goes off-script by topping the inky pasta with chrysanthemum greens that deliver an exuberant, aromatic punch that brightens the dish.
But Hur doesn't stop at reinterpreting classics. His creativity and smart execution are in full flight when he devises his own dishes, like a French-style confit of rabbit ($22) he serves with North Korean-style sweet-savory soy-glazed ddeok (chubby, chubby, mochi-like cylinders). By slow-poaching the rabbit in oil, Hur transforms the ultra-lean meat. Touch it with your fork, and it succumbs. Every bite of chewy ddeok dipped into the jalapeÃ±o-oil demiglace underscores the rabbit's tenderness further.
When I tasted it, I couldn't believe I was sitting 15 feet above where I'd sat dodging sake bombs one week prior. But there I was, eating a captivating dish as good as any single plate I have tasted in New England.
Upstairs, it turns out, is the right choice.

For Trump, 'Investigate the investigators!' is an attempt to flip the script

Texto completo: For President Trump's reelection effort, "Investigate the investigators!" is becoming the new "Lock her up!"
Trump and his allies, seeking to amplify claims that the FBI spied on his 2016 campaign, are seizing on news reports and statements by Attorney General William P. Barr to launch a political rallying cry they view as an antidote to special counsel Robert S. Mueller III's findings.
Dismissed by critics as an outlandish conspiracy theory, "spygate" is fast becoming a central feature of the Trump campaign as it seeks to go on offense in the wake of a report that identified 10 instances of potential obstruction of justice by Trump. The campaign is publicly calling for criminal investigations into former FBI officials, making "spygate" fundraising pitches and selling spy-themed merchandise. The goal, officials said, is to turn the Russia probe into a political winner that could help him secure another term.
"After two years of [investigations] and being vindicated, and now in fact the tables are turning in that the investigators will be investigated, there's a certain amount of righteous indignation that's warranted," said Tim Murtaugh, communications director for Trump's reelection bid. "The president has already shown that he wants to talk about it. He's been tweeting about it. I'm sure he'll talk about it at rallies. It's something that the campaign will continue to point to."
Murtaugh highlighted a Thursday article from the New York Times describing how the FBI sent an investigator posing as a research assistant to meet with Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos in 2016 - a covert effort to better understand the campaign's links to Russia. Murtaugh said it was "astounding" that the story had not received as much media coverage as some Russia-related episodes unearthed by Mueller.
Referring to the story on Friday, Trump said it was "bigger than Watergate, as far as I'm concerned."
Trump has long sought to paint his political opponents as criminally suspect, spending much of 2016 leading "Lock her up!" chants that targeted his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton.
After Trump's own conduct became the subject of Mueller's criminal investigation - which did not establish that his campaign conspired with Russia's election interference but indicated that he may have obstructed justice - the president is aiming to change the narrative by highlighting the allegations of improper spying by the FBI.
Trump has gotten a boost from Barr, who used recent congressional hearings about Mueller's probe to express concerns that the Trump campaign may have been the victim of improper surveillance. When pressed, Barr declined to offer evidence and said he was simply "concerned about it" and "looking into it."
Republicans have long claimed that the FBI's actions targeting Carter Page, the former Trump campaign adviser whose communications were secretly surveilled in late 2016 and early 2017 under a warrant from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, amounted to political spying. Surveillance of Page took place after he left the Trump campaign and was authorized by several judges.
Democrats have criticized Barr's allegations as irresponsible and have dismissed Trump's charges of spying as a political smokescreen aimed at distracting from Mueller's findings.
"The Trump campaign is trying to use a debunked conspiracy theory to distract from the Trump administration's attacks on the rule of law and its attempts to cover up Mueller's findings," said Daniel Wessel, a spokesman for the Democratic National Committee. "Voters won't be fooled."
Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz is conducting an internal investigation into aspects of the Russia probe, including the FISA warrant targeting Page. Barr has said Horowitz's report would probably be completed in May or June.
Trump has also said he will soon be declassifying documents related to the warrant.
"Declassifying that and much more - yes," Trump said Wednesday in an interview with Boston Herald Radio's "The Adriana Cohen Show." "I will be releasing that and many other things."
Trump's focus on re-litigating the origins of the Russia probe serves a purpose beyond ginning up his political base, campaign aides and allies said.
It helps the president create a new narrative casting himself as a victim even as House Democrats pursue multiple investigations into Trump, his administration and his businesses.
As Democrats issue subpoenas, hold hearings and seek to interview witnesses identified in the Mueller report, Trump and his allies plan to offer counterprogramming by intensifying their public scrutiny of the Russia probe's origins.
Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), a Trump confidant and chairman of the Judiciary Committee, has said he plans to investigate the investigation into Trump's 2016 campaign.
"When the Mueller report is put to bed, and it soon will be, this committee is going to look long and hard at how this all started," he said Wednesday during a hearing with Barr.
The Mueller report documented that the FBI's counterintelligence probe began after a foreign government alerted U.S. officials that Papadopoulos claimed in 2016 that he had heard about a Russian effort to help the Trump campaign by anonymously releasing damaging information about Clinton.
The Mueller report also documented multiple contacts between Trump's campaign and Russian officials as the Kremlin was taking action to interfere in the election. Several Trump aides were receptive to Russian help, and some were convicted of lying to investigators about their communications with Russians, the report found. Mueller did not establish that Trump's campaign conspired in Russia's effort to influence the election.
Trump allies believe there's political benefit in continuing to talk about the Russia investigation, as it allows the president to cast himself as a victim of powerful forces like the FBI. Most do not mention that the FBI did not reveal its investigation into Trump's campaign until after the election, while it made unprecedented disclosures about its investigation into Clinton's use of private email for government business.
Clinton, who was not charged, has said that her loss was partially caused by those FBI disclosures in the days before the election.
Bryan Lanza, an adviser to Trump's 2016 campaign and transition, said the president can prevail politically by using the Russia investigation to attack the Democrats.
"There are partisan Democrats that want to turn the page on an ugly part of American history," he said. "But we're not going to let them do that."
The Trump campaign has already sought to turn the spying allegations into a fundraising pitch. There's some evidence it's working. A Republican Party official said that Trump's campaign has had two days of fundraising totals above $1 million since the Mueller report was released last month. A campaign official said fundraising in the 24 hours after the report was released to the public and Congress on April 18 was up about 250 percent from previous days. Both officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe internal fundraising figures.
The campaign, meanwhile, has been selling spy-themed merchandise. One T-shirt for sale depicts former president Barack Obama donning a set of spy glasses while lurking in thick green shrubbery.

R.I.P. 'Santa Clarita Diet'; Charming series about the undead now dead, but not really, because it's still on Netflix; ANALYSIS

Texto completo: There's a moment in the third season of "Santa Clarita Diet" where, shortly after Timothy Olyphant's Joel Hammond almost disparages his undead wife by calling her a zombie - "zom ... body," he pivots - he suggests they kill another undead person to prevent more harm to others.
Sheila (Drew Barrymore), his wife, balks and suggests that they extend a bit more courtesy to the undead. Joel, a human, remarks that the undead "eat people," to which she responds, "So do I, Joel. But I'm also much more than that, and no matter how much good I'm doing, is that all you're ever gonna see?"
He does see past it, but the casual Netflix viewer might not - even after three seasons, "Santa Clarita Diet" is still often reduced to "the Drew Barrymore zombie show."
Last week, Netflix wound up canceling the series, which fell through the cracks despite its A-list leads, their charismatic performances and the surprisingly authentic relationship showcased by the Hammonds' antics.
"Santa Clarita Diet" might be over, but as Sheila would point out, death doesn't signify the end. Netflix users can still stumble upon this odd gem, which began two years ago with Sheila projectile vomiting while she and Joel, married real estate agents in southern California, show a house to potential buyers. She dies in the bathroom and comes back to "life," without a heartbeat and with intense cravings for raw flesh.
The show follows the Hammonds' attempts to keep Sheila's undead state under wraps, with help from their stubborn teenage daughter, Abby (Liv Hewson), and their geeky neighbor, Eric (Skyler Gisondo), who'll do anything to spend time with Abby.
The mystery of why the show lacked a renewal-worthy following deepens when considering the largely positive reviews it garnered. When the first season hit Netflix, the New York Times praised the use of "zombification as the route to midlife rejuvenation," while the Boston Globe applauded creator Victor Fresco ("Better Off Ted") for his mastery of the show's "droll, perverse humor." The Atlantic noted that "if you can get with the gore, there's frequently a sweet, oddball marital comedy fighting to get out."
The comedy leaned into its screwball nature more and more with each season, a trend matched by stronger ratings: Rotten Tomatoes gave the first season a 78 percent rating, the second an 89 percent rating and the third a solid 100. As a friend pointed out, "Santa Clarita Diet" thrives when it abides by improv comedy's "Yes, and" principle.
Both Barrymore, who took on the role during a difficult time in her life because of how much she loved the script, and Olyphant, who found the right stage to show off his comedic chops, seemed more than happy to oblige. Despite being the show's rationalizing straight man, Joel will almost always go along with Sheila's plans, no matter how absurd.
Consider, for instance, the opening scene of the show's second episode. Joel digs a hole in which to bury the remains of a loathsome colleague Sheila killed while she cheerfully tells him about a listing they might be able to snag: "Guess what Kelly told me last night?" Sheila says. "She and Ben are selling their home. It's a beautiful property." Joel affirms her excitement through gritted teeth - "That'd be great, honey. We can't be realtors if we don't have listings!" - but seems more bothered by Sheila misplacing the lid of the container holding the colleague's body parts than by the gruesome murder itself.
Similar to the vampire-centric "What We Do in the Shadows," an FX series based on the cult film of the same name, "Santa Clarita Diet" derived its humor from the mundanities of life as a bloodthirsty creature - at the end of the day, the Hammonds are just an unconventional suburban couple trying to run a successful real estate business.
The show's tone struck a halfway point between melodramatic and blase, a tricky balance maintained by Barrymore and Olyphant's complementary performances. Whereas Sheila is light and erratic, Joel holds down the fort with restraint and reason. They brought the star power, but Hewson and Gisondo, who will soon be seen on the big screen with Olivia Wilde's "Booksmart," rounded out the talented main cast. (Not to mention Mary Elizabeth Ellis, Natalie Morales and Joel McHale in supporting roles.)
With three seasons of 10 episodes each, "Santa Clarita Diet" is a quick and lighthearted watch. Fresco and fellow executive producer Tracy Katsky wrote a farewell note to disappointed fans in a similar style late last week: "Everything ends. This was a thing. And so it ended," they captioned an Instagram post. "We'll miss it but we are proud of the work we did and will always appreciate the love and enthusiasm we felt from our audience." The note also included statements from a grateful Barrymore and from Olyphant, whose devotion to the work seemed akin to Joel's.
"I loved working on this show," he wrote. "I'm going to continue coming in and doing scenes. If they don't want to film it, that's up to them."

Texto completo: FARMINGTON — Elizabeth Strout, winner of the prestigious Pulitzer Prize in Fiction and New York Times bestselling author, will be the commencement speaker for the University of Maine at Farmington Class of 2019, the university announced recently.
She also will be the recipient of an honorary degree of Doctor of Humane Letters at this year’s ceremony, which will take place Saturday, May 11, at 10:30 a.m. on the UMF campus.
“Elizabeth Strout’s extraordinary career has its roots in a deeply abiding sense of Maine’s unique spirit,” said Eric C. Brown, UMF interim president.
“Her writing is authentic, unabashed in its rendering of the full range of human experience, from the troubled to the triumphant, and a wonderful example of the power of story in shaping life’s meaning. We are thrilled to have her address our 2019 graduating class,” Brown said.
Born in Portland, and raised in small towns in Maine and New Hampshire, Strout was drawn to writing at a young age. Her early experiences provided a rich backdrop for her love of natural surroundings and her insight into the people who lived there. Strout lives in New York City.
Her work has garnered critical acclaim for its “distinctly New England” stories and powerful characterizations. “Olive Kitteridge,” winner of the 2009 Pulitzer Prize in Fiction, was lauded by the judges for packing “a cumulative emotional wallop, bound together by polished prose and by Olive, the title character, blunt, flawed and fascinating.”
In addition to the Pulitzer, Strout is the author of “Anything Is Possible,” her most recent book and winner of The Story Prize; “My Name Is Lucy Barton,” longlisted for the Man Booker Prize; “The Burgess Boys,” named one of the best books of the year by The Washington Post and NPR; “Abide with Me,” a national bestseller; and “Amy and Isabelle,” winner of the Los Angeles Times Art Seidenbaum Award for First Fiction and the Chicago Tribune Heartland Prize.
Strout also has been a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award, the PEN/Faulkner Award for Fiction, the International Dublin Literary Award, and the Orange Prize. Her short stories have been published in a number of magazines, including The New Yorker.
Graduating senior Jonas Maines, from Portland, will give the student address. A performing arts major, Maines has taken advantage of numerous opportunities to perform, direct, and write during his four years at UMF.
He has performed in five of the University’s main stage productions, including the leading role in a recent production of Hamlet. He also has participated in the theater department’s student directed One-Act Play Festival and the Festival of New Plays that features original works written, produced, directed and performed by UMF theater students.
Maines is the president of the UMF chapter of Alpha Psi Omega, a national theater honor society, and is a member of Theatre UMF, the on-campus student theater organization. He has also been a longtime member of the Lawn Chair Pirates, the UMF student improvisation group, which he credits with helping him to become a more confident performer.
Maines received the Spirit of Matthew Shepherd Award in 2015. After graduation, he will live in Austin, Texas, where he will be involved with Hyde Park Theatre and pursuing a career in theater.
Brown and Kathryn W. Yardley, acting provost and vice president for academic affairs; Nicholas A. Koban, associate provost; and Jonathan R. Cohen, professor of philosophy; will confer degrees to this year’s graduates.
Trevor Hustus, member of the University of Maine System board of trustees, will deliver greetings to the graduates. The National Anthem will be sung by Joshua A. Beckett, a graduating senior from Warren.
The outdoor ceremony will be held behind the UMF Olsen Student Center and is free and open to the public. Guests of graduates are also welcome to watch the ceremony live in C131 in Roberts Learning Center. In case of inclement weather, the ceremony will be held inside the UMF Fitness & Recreation Center.
Admission to the indoor ceremony will be limited to those who have already received “Fitness and Recreation Center” tickets. During the indoor ceremony, guests can watch the event live in C131 and C23 in Roberts Learning Center and in the classrooms and Bjorn Lobby in the UMF Theodora J. Kalikow Education Center. The UMF Commencement ceremony will be webcast live at www.umf.maine.edu whether the ceremony is held indoors or outdoors.

Texto completo: BOSTON — A mother of a Chinese student previously enrolled at Stanford University acknowledges she paid $6. 5 million to the ringleader of a college admissions scheme after her daughter was admitted – but she claims she was duped into thinking she was making a donation to the school.
An attorney for the mother of Yusi Zhao, who is no longer at Stanford, confirmed the seven-figure payment to William "Rick" Singer in a statement to USA TODAY.
But she was not a knowing conspirator, the attorney said, claiming the daughter is actually herself a "victim. "
The admission of the payment, made in 2017, points to Singer's network perhaps extending far overseas in addition to the 33 wealthy U. S. parents, primarily in California, accused of paying him large sums of money to get their children into elite U. S schools.
More: Inside Rick Singer's college admissions network: An ex-con half brother, a Welsh soccer team and a former NFL owner
Vincent Law, a Hong Kong-based attorney representing the mother, who lives in China, said that since Singer's operation has been reported, Zhao has "come to realize she has been misled, her generosity has been taken advantage of, and her daughter has fallen victim to the scam. "
He added that both Zhao and her daughter Yusi Zhao are "shocked and deeply disturbed. "
When the Justice Department in March announced charges against Singer, 33 parents and college coaches in a sweeping nationwide college admissions probe, the top prosecutor in Massachusetts, Andrew Lelling, said one family had paid as much as $6. 5 million – the largest amount in the case – to ensure their child got into a university.
But the identity of that family was not named, nor is it mentioned in court documents.
It remained one of the case's biggest mysteries until the Los Angeles Times and New York Times this week first reported the student was Yusi Zhao, whose family made billions in the pharmaceutical industry. She enrolled in Stanford in 2017.
The Zhao family is not among the 50 defendants charged in the "Varsity Blues" college admission case. Neither is the family of Sherry Guo, also a native of China, whom the Wall Street Journal is reportedly the unnamed "Yale Applicant 1" whose family allegedly paid $1. 2 million to Singer to help get their daughter into Yale.

Former Stanford head sailing coach John Vandemoer in March pleaded guilty to racketeering charges for taking bribes to designate applicants as student-athletes. Federal prosecutors say that Vandemoer agreed to designate two applicants as sailing recruits with help from fake documents produced by Singer that falsified their athletic credentials.
In one of the exchanges, prosecutors say Singer made a $500,000 to the Stanford sailing program. But Stanford has said the $500,000 payment came months after the student was already admitted and "played no role" in the student getting accepted into the school.
As the largest-ever college admissions conspiracy case proceeds in Boston federal court, prosecutors have hinted in court documents there's a likelihood that additional parents will be charged.
A spokeswoman for the U. S. Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts did not say when asked why charges have not been made in either the $6. 5 million or $1. 2 million payment to Singer. But she added that "the investigation remains active, including potentially charging additional defendants. "
Donald Heller, Singer's attorney, declined to comment on the statement from Zhao's lawyer. Singer, who has already pleaded guilty to conspiracy charges, is cooperating with prosecutors.
Law said, "Like many families from Asia, Mrs. Zhao is not familiar with the admission process for colleges. " He did not disclose Zhao's full name and only identified her as "Mrs. Zhao. "
He said that Zhao was referred to Singer by a third-party education adviser and as a result "came to know Singer's charity foundation, which was represented to her as a substantial and legitimate non-profit foundation for supporting education. "

Federal prosecutors have said that Singer used his nonprofit, The Key Worldwide Foundation, to funnel payments from parents to either bribe coaches to admit students as athletes or to rig ACT or SAT test scores.
But Law said Singer provided only educational advisory services to Zhao. He said Yusi Zhao had a strong academic record and that she was accepted into a number of U. S. colleges and universities after applying through "ordinary channels. " She was accepted into Stanford on March 31, 2017, he said.
Law said that Singer was "surprised to hear" that Yusi Zhao had been admitted into a prestigious U. S school and asked the mother to make a donation to Stanford through his foundation. Law said the purpose of the donation was described as being for the salaries of academic staff, scholarships, athletics programs and helping students who would not otherwise be able to attend the school.
"Based on Mr Singer’s representation, on (April 21, 2017) Mrs. Zhao donated $6. 5 million to Mr Singer’s foundation," Law said. "This generous act was not only done for the good of the school and its students, but also done out of the love and support of Yusi by a caring mother. "
He added: "The donation is in the same nature as those that many affluent parents have been doing openly to prestigious universities. "

Stanford last month rescinded admission of an unidentified student who was associated with the $500,000 contribution to the sailing program. But E. J. Miranda, a Stanford spokesman, said the school can't identify the name of the student because of federal student privacy law.
Stanford said the student was dismissed for falsifying information in the student's application. The university has said the student's entry was not recommended by the sailing coach, Vandemoer, nor has the student ever been affiliated with the sailing program.
In a statement from the university this week, officials sought to clarify that Stanford did not receive $6. 5 million from Singer, nor from a student’s family working with Singer. School officials say they were unaware of the $6. 5 million payment from the family to Singer until it was reported this week.
In all, the school said Stanford's sailing program received $770,000 through payments from Singer's organization: $110,000 and $160,000 associated with two students – neither of whom was admitted to Stanford – and the $500,000 payment.
Nineteen defendants have either pleaded guilty or agreed to plead guilty in the nation's college admission conspiracy case.
Among the parents accused of paying bribes to ensure the entry of their children into colleges is actress Felicity Huffman, who is expected to plead guilty in court May 13, and Lori Loughlin who has pleaded not guilty to chares.

Reagan's rat pack of economists is back

Texto completo: For the better part of the last century, the American Dream was fairly universal, and it was profoundly inclusionary. Everyone had her or his own American Dream fitting their particular circumstances, and they dreamt of even better ones for their children.
I started out in the lower middle class. My early family life, growing up in the Pacific Northwest in the 1950s and '60s, had its difficulties and challenges, and I started working outside the house at the age of 9. But I was white, male and fairly clever, and these traits made every difference then and they've certainly made my entire life journey much easier.
Seared in my memory, however, is September 1970, when, in my second year at Stanford Business School, Milton Friedman wrote his infamous New York Times Magazine article in which he contended that increasing shareholder value was all that mattered. In Friedman's view, the welfare of employees was unimportant, even less so was that of customers and communities.
Friedman fairly quickly was anointed as the father of what came to be called "supply-side" or "trickle-down" economics. And despite some prominent business and political leaders pointing out the selfishness of Friedman's prescription, by the mid-1980s, the nation was caught in a hurricane of full-blown supply-side economics. This storm would buoy the fortunes of the richest and begin the slow drowning of those of everyone else.
This pernicious pursuit of profit at any cost has been a constant in the ensuing decades, but it has ramped up dramatically under Trump. Reagan's "Rat Pack" of trickle-down economists is, as described in an excellent April 19 article in Politico, clearly coming back together in force under this administration. A reprobate gathering if there ever was one, led by Steve Forbes, Larry Kudlow, Art Laffer, David Malpass and Stephen Moore.
This "resurrection" is happening despite the facts that after 35 years of dominating trickle-down economic policies:
12 million workers are unemployed in real terms, with income inequality at an almost unprecedented high level. Right now, the richest 1 percent of earners take in 188 times as much as the bottom 90 percent combined.
Today's $22.65 average hourly wage, measured in constant 2018 dollars, is essentially unchanged from 1964 when it was $20.27 — up only 11.7 percent in 54 years.
Women earn just 78 cents on the dollar to their male counterparts.
The average large public company CEO earns about 360 times what his or her average employee earns, when for most of the last century that earnings multiple was responsibly seldom more than 20 times.
Most Americans' boats are sinking today, not rising – and a fair, balanced flotation is increasingly hard to foresee. Or to employ a proper "rat" analogy, most Americans are missing out on the cheese.
The popular anger that propelled Trump into the White House, and that is already being channeled in the 2020 presidential campaigns, is driven by the death of the American Dream for the young people who worry about their economic futures and about the sustainability of the planet, and for their parents who fret both about their children's futures now and their own retirement security later.
You either believe that America can survive and prosper with egregious economic imbalances, or you don't. And if you are tolerant and accepting of these imbalances, then it's probably because you're hoarding all the cheese.

Coloradan Is Seventh Senator to Enter Race

Texto completo: DENVER -- Michael Bennet, the moderate, studious Democratic senator from Colorado known for his work on education and immigration reform, announced his candidacy for president on Thursday.
He joins a field so packed with candidates that it now includes six of his colleagues in the Senate and his former boss, John Hickenlooper, a past governor of Colorado.
"I think this country faces two enormous challenges," he said in an interview on "CBS This Morning." "One is a lack of economic mobility and opportunity for most Americans, and the other is the need to restore integrity to our government."
Until recently, Mr. Bennet, a former school superintendent usually known for his professorial reserve, was not considered a presidential contender.
But in an uncharacteristically fiery speech on the Senate floor in January, during a government shutdown, he excoriated his Republican colleague Ted Cruz, shouting repeatedly as he accused him of shedding "crocodile tears" over unpaid government workers. He denounced President Trump for shutting down the government over his desired border wall, which Mr. Bennet termed a promise the president couldn't keep and America didn't want.
[Democrats have 20 spots in the first debate. There are now 21 candidates.]
The speech was viewed millions of times online, widely aired on cable news and led to calls for Mr. Bennet, 54, to consider a presidential run.
"He revealed that he is capable of anger and passion," said former Senator Gary Hart of Colorado, a longtime friend of Mr. Bennet's, who said the senator had come to him recently to discuss a possible campaign. "When it gets to be that blatant, the hypocrisy on the other side, you have no choice but to speak out."
Mr. Bennet now faces the challenge of setting himself apart in the Democratic field and competing against better-known candidates, some of whom have been laying the groundwork for their campaigns for months or years.
Among them is Mr. Hickenlooper, who once hired Mr. Bennet as his chief of staff. "They are friends," said Mr. Hart. "They will be polite to each other. They're not going to go on background and stick a knife in one another."
[Who's in? Who's out? Keep up with the 2020 field with our candidate tracker.]
Mr. Bennet was asked on Thursday about the high number of Democrats running (he is the 21st to declare his candidacy). "This is the opportunity for us to show what we stand for, for us to have a competition of ideas," he said. "I think it's phenomenal that we've got as diverse an array of candidates as we have, in all respects, and that we've got the number that we have."

Mr. Bennet became a senator in 2009 after he was appointed by Gov. Bill Ritter, a Democrat who needed to fill a seat left empty by Ken Salazar, who had just become interior secretary. Mr. Bennet narrowly won re-election in 2010, then cruised to victory in 2016. He has described his top issues as education, climate change, immigration, health care and national security.
In early April, Mr. Bennet announced that he had prostate cancer, but he said he would not let it deter his presidential aspirations. "I am fortunate it was detected early," he said at the time, "and as a result, my prognosis is good." In mid-April, he had surgery that his staff called "completely successful."
As a senator, Mr. Bennet is best known as a member of the so-called Gang of Eight, the bipartisan group that crafted a sweeping immigration reform bill in 2013. The legislation, which would have provided more than $ 46 billion to bolster border security while also carving a path to citizenship, passed in the Senate but never made it to the House. "If the president-elect really wants to fix our immigration system, he should study the work of the Gang of Eight," Mr. Bennet wrote in an editorial in The Denver Post in 2017.
During his tenure, Mr. Bennet has developed a reputation as a studious senator with a habit of mulling decisions for weeks. He has bucked the more liberal base of his party on a number of big issues, including his support of the Keystone XL oil pipeline. His frustration with the Trump administration, however, has brought him more in line with colleagues to his left.
His maternal grandparents were Jews who fled the Warsaw Ghetto, moving their family out of Poland to Mexico and eventually to New York. (Mr. Bennet's parents raised him with Jewish and Christian traditions.)
His younger brother, James Bennet, is the editorial page editor of The New York Times. James Bennet recused himself on Thursday "from any work generated by the opinion desk related to the 2020 presidential election," The Times said in a statement.
After stints as an aide to the Ohio governor and as counsel at the Justice Department, Michael Bennet came to Colorado, where he took a job with the Anschutz Investment Co., restructuring corporate debt. He later joined the administration of Mr. Hickenlooper, then the mayor of Denver, and spent several years as the superintendent of Denver Public Schools.
He lives in Denver with his wife, Susan Daggett, a natural resources lawyer, and their three daughters.
In January, after his impassioned speech on the Senate floor, Mr. Bennet went on MSNBC, where he was asked if he was considering a run for president. "I'm thinking about it," he said, adding that he thought the nation was moving in a "terrible direction."
"Donald Trump is much more a symptom of our problems than he is the creator of our problems," the senator said. "He is an accelerant. He was sent here to blow this place up. That's what people in my state who voted for him said. And guess what? They succeeded. But now we've got to pick up the pieces."

Texto completo: A woman who asked George Papadopoulos point blank if President Trump's campaign was working with the Russians at a bar in London in September 2016 was reportedly working undercover for the FBI.
The woman who said her name was Azra Turk posed as an assistant to Stefan Halper, an American professor at Cambridge University, sources told the New York Times. Halper served as an informant to the FBI to collect information for the bureau's Russia investigation during the 2016 election cycle.
Papadopoulos, who was a foreign policy adviser to the Trump campaign, discussed this woman in his book, Deep State Target. He described her as attractive and doubted she was being forthcoming about her identity after she asked whether the Trump campaign was working for Russia.
“There is no way this is a Cambridge professor’s research assistant,” he wrote.
In reaction to the article by the Times, Papadopoulos insisted that Turk was not working for the FBI. "I agree with everything in this superb article except 'Azra Turk' clearly was not FBI. She was CIA and affiliated with Turkish intel. She could hardly speak English and was tasked to meet me about my work in the energy sector offshore Israel/Cyprus which Turkey was competing with," he wrote in a tweet.
Turk attended a second of Papadopoulos and Halper's meetings, and it was at a third Papadopoulos wrote in his book that he cut the meeting short after Halper pressed him on hacked emails.
After meeting Papadopoulos, Turk exchanged emails with him, calling their meeting the “highlight of my trip" and said "I am excited about what the future holds for us :)."
Turk returned to the United States after the FBI determined no valuable intelligence had been gathered at the meetings.
The Justice Department inspector general's investigators are now looking into Halper, who met multiple members of Trump's campaign, to assess whether he exceeded his mandate. His role as an FBI informant was leaked to the media in May 2018, after which Trump and his allies alleged his campaign was the target of a politically motivated "spygate" scheme. Trump tweeted the FBI embedding a spy in the 2016 campaign would be the "all time biggest political scandal" if true.
The FBI launched its original counterintelligence investigation, called Crossfire Hurricane, in July 2016. It was prompted by Australian diplomat Alexander Downer informing the FBI that Papadopoulos told him Russia had stolen emails related to Hillary Clinton, Trump's Democratic rival in the 2016 election.
Papadopoulos pleaded guilty in October 2017 to making false statements to the FBI about his contacts with Russians and served 12 days in prison late last year. He agreed to cooperate with the Russia investigation conducted by special counsel Robert Mueller, who recently wrapped up and found no criminal conspiracy between the Trump campaign and the Russians.
Attorney General William Barr says he is "reviewing the conduct" of the FBI's initial investigation into the Trump campaign in the summer of 2016.

Texto completo: Los fiscales federales continúan descubriendo nuevos padres que pagaron sumas millonarias para asegurar los estudios de sus hijos en las más importantes universidades de Estados Unidos.
Un nuevo escándalo involucra a la familia de una estudiante de China que presuntamente pagó $6.5 millones de dólares para ingresar a Stanford, una de las universidades más prestigiosas del mundo.
La noticia, que fue reportada inicialmente por Los Angeles Times, asegura que Yusi Zhao, conocida como Molly, ingresó a la universidad de Stanford a inicios del 2017 gracias a la suma millonaria que su familia pagó a William “Rick” Singer, quién fue admitida para hacer parte de un equipo deportivo de navegación de la universidad. Según el New York Times, la estudiante fue expulsada de la universidad en abril de este año, pero no está claro si Zhao y su familia están siendo investigados en Estados Unidos.
En un nuevo artículo publicado hoy, Los Angeles Times asegura que otra familia china pagó $1.2 millones de dólares para que sus hijas fueran admitidas a la universidad Yale.
Mientras las investigaciones continúan, las personas siguen esperando cuál será la próxima celebridad o influyente empresario en caer por participar en este esquema de estafa . Según el New York Times, cientos de padres están buscando abogados defensores para protegerse de esta oleada de destape de sobornos y de humillación pública que se convirtió en el escándalo de admisiones a universidades más grande en la historia de Estados Unidos.

James Comey: Trump eating the souls of Barr, Rosenstein

Texto completo: Former FBI Director James Comey berated Attorney General William Barr and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein for what he said is complicity in President Trump’s behavior.
Writing in a New York Times op-ed published Wednesday, Comey was astonished at the Justice Department officials’ defense of the president in the aftermath of the release of special counsel Robert Mueller’s redacted report on his Russia investigation.
“What happened to these people?” asked Comey, who was fired by Trump in 2017.
“Proximity to an amoral leader reveals something depressing. I think that’s at least part of what we’ve seen with Bill Barr and Rod Rosenstein. Accomplished people lacking inner strength can’t resist the compromises necessary to survive Mr. Trump and that adds up to something they will never recover from,” he said.
The complicity begins, Comey said, when Trump goes unchallenged by administration officials when he lies. It continues with “public displays of personal fealty” and with silence when Trump attacks institutions and values.
“Trump eats your soul in small bites,” he wrote.
“You use his language, praise his leadership, tout his commitment to values. And then you are lost. He has eaten your soul,” Comey said.
The op-ed was published as Barr testified to the Senate Judiciary Committee. Comey accused Barr of downplaying alleged obstruction of justice by the president, which Barr described as Trump being “frustrated and angry.” He also slammed Rosenstein for thanking Trump upon announcing his resignation.

How should journalists report data hacks?

Texto completo: The phrase in the New York Times story hit a lot of readers - and a lot of journalists - like a slap across the face.
Major news organizations functioned during the 2016 presidential campaign as "a de facto instrument of Russian intelligence."
It was a harsh assessment of how Russian-hacked emails were turned into news stories, but one that certainly contained an element of truth.
Later, Times reporter Amy Chozick, in her book, "Chasing Hillary," mused on the eagerness for the revelations: "I can't explain it exactly except to compare it to a fever that spread through every newsroom and made us all salivate over the tiniest morsels," Chozick wrote.
She memorably summed up her own decision-making: "I chose the byline. I always chose the byline."
The Times, of course, was far from alone in reporting on the revelations from the Democratic National Committee's internal emails. In fact, it would be hard to find a news organization that didn't publish its plentiful share.
But what about next time a foreign adversary tries to sway American politics though cyberwarfare?
Should reporters and editors refuse to publish newsworthy revelations - such as, in the 2016 hack, Democratic Party officials working to thwart Sen. Bernie Sanders in the primary? (The revelations disrupted the Democratic National Convention and forced the resignation of DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz.)
Or should journalists make decisions on newsworthiness alone? What should they learn?
"The question is an important one because press amplification of the Russian-hacked content is a probable explanation for the 2016 erosion in the public perception that Hillary Clinton was qualified to be president," Kathleen Hall Jamieson, director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania, wrote in a recent Boston Globe piece.
There is no perfect answer. It is, after all, not illegal for journalists to report on stolen information, and it is the press' primary job to tell the public what it can find out about what powerful people and institutions are doing.
But ethical questions abound - and top editors around the country have been grappling with them.
"One takeaway for me is that we should put as much investigative muscle into finding out the source and motivation as we do into the information itself," New York Times Executive Editor Dean Baquet told me.
"That's not always easy in the heat of the moment and the heat of competition." He said, though, that he does not regret publishing revelations from the emails because of their significant newsworthiness.
Washington Post Executive Editor Martin Baron told me, in an email, that The Post's Ellen Nakashima was the first journalist to report, in June 2016, that DNC emails had been hacked and that Russian government hackers were believed to be responsible.
After the hack, he said, The Post was selective in what it published from the available emails, and it repeatedly made clear in its stories that U.S. intelligence officials believed Russia had stolen the emails.
"Our standard was whether they contained information genuinely relevant to the public - voters in this case," Baron said.
In her Globe piece, Jamieson observes that, in general, the news media didn't do a great job of emphasizing where the revelations came from.
And she notes that the recently released Mueller report concludes that Russian intelligence officers gave reporters early access to archives of leaked files by sending links and passwords to pages on the website DCLeaks.com.
She offers a thought experiment:
What if, during the third presidential debate, moderator Chris Wallace had emphasized the source of the emails he was bringing up in a question about Clinton's supposed desire for "open borders" - perhaps like this: "My next question is based on stolen Democratic materials, whose accuracy we have been unable to verify, gotten by Russian hackers through cybertheft?"
Viewers would have been more prone to ask, she suggests, "Why would the Russians and Assange want to defeat the Democratic nominee?"
Julian Assange, who co-founded WikiLeaks - where many of the Democratic emails were first published - is known to be a Clinton antagonist, and Russian officials, we now know beyond a doubt, were working hard to help Donald Trump get elected.
BuzzFeed News has revised its standards guidelines to address hacked material, CNN's Oliver Darcy and Donie O'Sullivan reported last week.
Stories should "treat the intention of the hacker as a major part of the story," said Editor in Chief Ben Smith, and "maintain a high bar for news value."
Columbia Journalism School professor Todd Gitlin told the CNN reporters that "under no circumstances" should hacked material be used "without a clear and unmistakable provenance that can be shared with readers."
That these issues will come around again is almost inevitable. Recall that the 2014 hack of internal emails at Sony Pictures was credibly blamed on North Korea, and that little has happened to inhibit the exponential growth of cyberwarfare worldwide.
Newsrooms need to do everything in their power to be prepared to handle hacked information responsibly and thoughtfully - even in the heat of a breaking news story.
In short: Don't publish weaponized gossip. Verify relentlessly. Nail down, and emphasize, the source of the hack and its motivation. And be transparent with news consumers.
Or be prepared to become, in that dreaded phrase, "the de facto instrument" of a foreign adversary's fondest hopes.

Texto completo: LEXINGTON COUNTY – Major e-cigarette company Juul is looking to establish a production plant in the Midlands, according to two Lexington County officials familiar with the discussions.
Representatives for the company met with officials from Lexington County in recent months to discuss the possibility, according to one county official who asked to remain unnamed.
State Sen. Katrina Shealy, R-Lexington, said the possibility of a South Carolina plant is still "up in the air and negotiations are ongoing," but bringing more jobs to Lexington County would be a big bonus. Shealy said the company talked about bringing 800 jobs, but the Lexington County source said the company did not indicate how many jobs would be created.
Shealy said Juul is eyeing a place for a manufacturing plant, but the Lexington County source called it an assembly plant.
"They are looking at locations and one of them is in my district," Shealy told The New York Times in a story published on April 28.
A Juul spokesperson said Friday the company did not have plans to announce. Juul does not disclose which contractors it works with or where production plants are located.
However, job postings online show Juul Labs is seeking to fill two key positions. A site manufacturing engineer is needed to oversee "high volume manufacturing" processes and coordination with contractors in Columbia, the posting says. And a senior supplier quality engineer — a job posted in the third week of April — is needed to work as a "quality representative at our Columbia site to improve awareness, visibility, communication on quality initiatives to support departmental, functional, site, divisional and corporate quality goals and priorities."
A site in Richland-Lexington Airport District Enterprise Park is under consideration, according to Shealy and an airport spokesperson. Though the property is no longer owned by Columbia Metropolitan airport, it is inside the enterprise park.
More than a dozen stores in Lexington County carry Juul products.
Juul has become a major player in the world of e-cigarettes, easily outselling competitors and pervading U.S. culture at lightning-fast speed. The company, based in San Francisco, is expecting $3.4 billion in revenue this year, according to Bloomberg, and reportedly earned $12.4 million in profits in 2018.
Juul markets itself as having an innovative design that delivers a stronger hit of flavored vapor — made of nicotine salts — without the tar of cigarettes. The company's e-cigarettes also became popular because of their size: About as big as a USB drive, and rechargeable when plugged into a computer. The company sells different flavor "pods" which can be purchased and inserted into any Juul. Each pod offers about 200 puffs and is equivalent to a pack of cigarettes, according to the company's website.
However, what started as a marketing campaign that claimed to target young professionals wanting to quit cigarettes soon came into question as teens took to Juuling. Juul has come under scrutiny over the past couple of years for not regulating sales to minors tightly enough. The small e-cigarettes hit the middle and high school scenes and a trend boomed, with children and teens smoking fruity flavored pods, and even buying, selling and smoking them at school. Juuls became a social media sensation and according to some, a public health nightmare.
In 2017, the Centers for Disease Control put numbers on the habit: E-cigarette use in high school students increased by 900 percent from 2011 to 2015, becoming the tobacco product most commonly used by teens in the United States.
The Food and Drug Administration did not start regulating vape products as tobacco until 2016, and e-cigarette companies have until 2022 to submit applications to keep their products on the market.
Captain Adam Myrick, spokesperson for the Lexington County Sheriff's Department, said vaping is very common in county schools.
"It is a significant problem in our schools and we are working with school administrators to address the problem," he said.
The S.C. House and Senate passed a bill barring minors from entering stores that sell vape productswithout an adult. That bill was signed by Gov. Henry McMaster on April 26.
And some local governments, including Lexington County and the City of Columbia, have discussed cracking down on vaping with ordinances. Those efforts have been challenged by controversial bills that would ban local governments from passing regulations on cigarette and vaping products, among other things.
In recent months, Juul has made moves to improve its public image — a large banner on its website now displays a warning about nicotine being addictive and the company is supporting legislation to curb underage use — and has ramped up lobbying efforts, too. There are six registered Juul lobbyists in the Midlands, according to the South Carolina Ethics Commission. The company also formed an employee PAC in March 2018, Politico reported in December, and the PAC donated to more than a dozen attorney general campaigns, including that of South Carolina's Alan Wilson.
Juul also received heavy investment from the Altria Group, a tobacco conglomerate and frequent campaign contributor to South Carolina politicians.
The Juul Labs spokesperson emailed a statement:
"JUUL Labs is rapidly growing as we are focused on improving the lives of the world's one billion adult smokers and curbing youth usage. We are proud to support high-tech manufacturing in states across the country and we are continuously evaluating various new opportunities that can support our growth and help us give back to local communities."
Lexington County spokesperson Harrison Cahill and county council chairman Scott Whetstone said they had no comment.
Chantel Williams exhales a puff of vapor from a Juul pen in Vancouver, Wash., April 16. Britain and other nations have had success promoting e-cigarettes as a lower-risk alternative to smokers, without seeing a surge in underage vaping. But they also have tighter regulations, including strict limits on advertising.

Texto completo: James Holzhauer reached another "Jeopardy!" milestone with his 19th victory on the challenging quiz show Tuesday.
The triumph moves the 34-year-old professional sports gambler from Las Vegas into a third-place tie with David Madden, for the most consecutive wins. And he's only one victory behind No. 2, Julia Collins, although he remains substantially behind all-time champ Ken Jennings, who won 74 times. (Champions were limited to five appearances until 2003).
Even more impressively, Holzhauer racked up another huge money win, $96,276, on Tuesday, bringing his total to $1,426,330, more than halfway to Jennings' $2. 5 million haul in just over a quarter the number of appearances.
In line with his aggressive selection and wagering style, Holzhauer's Tuesday haul was much larger than the average champion's winnings, but it pales next to his own record for a single show, $131,127.
The reigning champ clearly wasn't affected by a close call on Monday's show. His $54,017 tally gave him an $18 win over runner-up Adam Levin, although Holzhauer orchestrated the slim margin with his tactical Final Jeopardy! wager.

Holzhauer explained his strategy in a Q&A last week with The New York Times. Unlike most players, he picks the highest-value clues first.
"You can see as soon as I get control of the board in the first game I’m going for the $1,000 clues whenever I have the opportunity," he said, likening his approach to a poker strategy.
"There are big advantages to having a lot of chips early on in a poker tournament," he told the Times. "You can make plays that other people can’t. "
Eddie Timanus, a five-time "Jeopardy!" winner who compiles the college coaches polls for USA TODAY Sports, describes Holzhauer as "a game-changer. "
Timanus notes Holzhauer's mastery of the signaling buzzer, but says he really stands out in his aggressive bidding.
"While many players, myself included, prefer to play categories from top to bottom and try to stick to them, Holzhauer clears the big-dollar clues first. Thanks to his ability to ring in first consistently and rarely miss, he usually has a considerable total built up by the time he uncovers a daily double. He finds most of them since he’s able to maintain control of the board for long stretches, and, as we've seen, he's not afraid to bet big," Timanus says.
His overall assessment of Holzhauer the player: "Speed, instinct, confidence and knowledge — pretty SICK, wouldn’t you say?"

Trump knocks NY, Cuomo and James over NRA fight

Texto completo: ALBANY – President Donald Trump on Monday criticized New York's leaders for targeting the National Rifle Association, but also warned the group to "get its act together quickly."
On Twitter, Trump also continued to knock his home state, saying "People are fleeing New York State because of high taxes and yes, even oppression of sorts. They didn't even put up a fight against SALT — could have won."
Trump was referring to Gov. Andrew Cuomo's ongoing criticism of the federal tax reform approved in 2017 that limits state and local tax deductions, known as SALT, to $10,000 a year — a move that mainly hurts wealthy New York homeowners.
"So much litigation," Trump continued. "The NRA should leave and fight from the outside of this very difficult to deal with (unfair) State!"
Lawsuit against NRA in New York On Friday, Attorney General Letitia James's office confirmed it opened an investigation into the NRA's tax-exempt status.
On Saturday, the NRA's president Oliver North announced he would not serve a second term amid turmoil in the organization.
"The NRA is under siege by Cuomo and the New York State A.G., who are illegally using the State's legal apparatus to take down and destroy this very important organization, & others," Trump said in the first of two tweets on the issue Monday morning.
"It must get its act together quickly, stop the internal fighting, & get back to GREATNESS - FAST!"
The New York Times reported that James sent letters to the NRA and its charitable foundation to preserve its financial records.
New York has jurisdiction over the NRA because it was chartered in the state in 1871.
NRA and New York The fight with the NRA is the latest in New York.
Cuomo's administration is looking to end an insurance policy run by the NRA, called "Carry Guard." The case is in court.
The Democratic governor has long fought with the NRA, and New York passed a series of gun-control laws in 2013 in the wake of the Newtown, Connecticut, school shootings.
Earlier this year, Cuomo and the Democratic-led legislature passed another round of gun laws, such as banning bump stocks and allow people to seek a court order to ban dangerous people from having guns.
On Monday, Cuomo responded to Trump's tweets by saying since the Newtown shootings, there have been 2,029 mass shootings in the nation.
Cuomo said that since Trump took office in 2017, there have been 74,600 gun-violence deaths, saying in a statement, "You have done nothing but tweet about it."
"The only thing illegal is the gun lobby's insurance scheme," Cuomo said. "Unlike you, President Trump, New York is not afraid to stand up to the NRA. I will continue to fight for the children of this state. As for the NRA, we'll remember them in our thoughts and prayers."
Trump and Cuomo Trump met with Cuomo at the White House in February to discuss the impact of the tax reforms on New York, but no resolution was reached.
Trump has repeatedly criticized his home state for its sagging upstate economy.
"I love those people," he said in February. "Those people are my voters. They've been treated very badly."
He added: "If New York isn't gonna treat them better, I would recommend they go to another state where they can get a great job."
New York Democrats, meanwhile, are fighting Trump on several fronts, including trying to get a law passed that would require the release of his state taxes to Congress.
Cuomo has been a regular critic of the Republican president, too.
"Nobody makes the anti-Trump case better than Trump. Just let Trump talk, and let Trump act, and let Trump divide," Cuomo said March 26 on WNYC radio.

Joe Biden accuser Lucy Flores is why #MeToo is becoming a joke

Texto completo: Lucy Flores has no real claim to be part of the #MeToo movement, but there she is in the New York Times, still pretending she was seriously violated when Joe Biden inhaled her hair.

Flores wrote Monday in an op-ed that she and other women are still waiting on an apology from Biden, as he gets his 2020 campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination moving.

“The #MeToo movement wasn’t just a flash in the pan,” she wrote. “It marked a profound tectonic shift toward continued female empowerment and self-realization that’s still evolving, and the ongoing rumbling continues to cause all kinds of discomfort.”

She said that with #MeToo, “we tapped into a newfound power that, first and foremost, demanded accountability, and the offenders were plentiful and easy to spot.”

Excuse me, but who is this “we” she's speaking of?

The #MeToo movement was created to address creepy horndogs like Harvey Weinstein and Mark Halperin — men who had explicitly and sexually forced themselves on their victims. When did it become a catch-all for any woman who had her personal space slightly intruded upon?

Flores’ melodramatic accusation is that at a campaign event in 2014, Biden puts his hands on her shoulders, pressed his face into her hair and kissed the back of her head.

It was the kind of encouraging gesture that Biden is known to offer. It sounds awkward, and no one can blame Flores for feeling repulsed when remembering it. But if this is what #MeToo has become, elevating mildly stressful encounters to sit equally with groping, uninvited nudity, and even violent assault, no one should take it seriously anymore

The whole movement is becoming a joke as people with no claim increasingly take the role of aggrieved victim. Look at the one that the Washington Post included in a report earlier this month about women alleging “encounters with [Biden] that made them feel uncomfortable.”

Sofie Karasek met Biden at the 2016 Oscars ceremony and recalled telling him about a woman she knew and who had committed suicide after being sexually assaulted. Biden grabbed Karasek’s hands and leaned in so that their foreheads were touching. The moment was caught in a photograph that went viral.

At the time, the Post called the photo “powerful.”

Karasek herself framed the picture and proudly displayed it on a shelf. She only took it down, according to the Post, “as the #MeToo movement began drawing more attention to cases of sexual harassment, assault and unwanted touching.”

This isn’t the #MeToo movement as we knew it. This is the left-wing of the Democratic Party using it as a weapon. This is a warning that the movement can be used to take anyone out. This is Biden being made into an example.

What critics had to say about the latest 'Game of Thrones' episode

Texto completo: One thing is for sure, if you watched Sunday night's episode of “Game of Thrones," you've got an opinion about it. The action jumped to warp speed in the third installment of the show's final season -- after the first two episodes left many wondering when exactly the plot would move forward.
Here's a look at how critics are reacting to the episode. (Warning, spoilers ahead.)
The darkness Spencer Kornhaber in The Atlantic:
“The scenery already looked as dark as a Goya painting at the start of the episode, but when the (rather unexplained) ice storm blew in, I had to scurry from the couch to the floor, inches from the TV, so as to try to make out the action."
Matthew Gilbert in The Boston Globe:
“It's as if [episode director] Sapochnik lost track of his own battle logic, if there was any in the script to begin with, and so he buried it all in a dark haze, CGI trickery, and audio jumble. The lighting was deficient, so that we couldn't know a lot more than the basics — that an ugly conflict was under way, that dragons were swooping somewhat randomly above, that it seemed as though the army of the dead was prevailing until the very end."
Alyssa Rosenberg in The Washington Post
“The Battle of Winterfell, much-ballyhooed as the biggest and longest battle sequence ever, was for the vast majority of its run largely incomprehensible thanks to the episode's incredibly muddy lighting; smeary images that made it appear that my television was malfunctioning during certain crucial moments. . . and the decision to use a lot of quick cuts in combination with very close shots."
Myles McNutt in the A.V. Club:
“The dim lighting is par for the course for the show (and as expected there were lots of complaints when I logged into Twitter after the episode), but I'll acknowledge that it feels more like an aesthetic choice here, the visual confusion designed to overwhelm our senses."
The battle Jeremy Egner in The New York Times:
“Sunday's final clash was a masterpiece of tension and release, goose bumps and heartbreak, grandiosity and intimacy. It deftly mixed genres (horror, action, melodrama), shots and planes of action as it shifted from the chaos of the fighting in and around Winterfell, to the claustrophobic terror of the crypts, to the dragon dogfighting in the winter sky."
Myles McNutt in the A.V. Club:
“This is yet another large-scale battle, similar to the Battle Of The Bastards, where the moment you start getting your breath back and begin taking stock of what happened, the spell of the immersion breaks and you realize that there's not as much 'there' there as you were hoping for."
The Night King David Sims in The Atlantic:
“The Night King is dull as dishwater. The comparison between his army of death and the looming threat of environmental catastrophe might feel facile, but in the end that's all it really amounted to."
Myles McNutt in the A.V. Club:
“. . .when the ice shards settled I just found myself going back and thinking about how the Night King was introduced as a tragedy with his creation and then just wages a war with no stated purpose and dies without doing anything but killing off a few supporting characters whose arcs were always headed toward death to begin with."
About those deaths. . . Alyssa Rosenberg in The Washington Post
“ 'Game of Thrones' " distinguished itself from other major fantasy hits in its willingness to kill off what were ostensibly its main characters, but in a battle of this consequence, seemed almost timid about slimming down its formidable cast."
Jeremy Egner in The New York Times:
“The death toll included demises predictable (Theon, Jorah) and less so (Melisandre!), but each was deeply felt and in service of individual purposes, one of the episode's big themes."

Texto completo: The phrase in the New York Times story hit a lot of readers - and a lot of journalists - like a slap across the face.
Major news organizations functioned during the 2016 presidential campaign as "a de facto instrument of Russian intelligence."
It was a harsh assessment of how Russian-hacked emails were turned into news stories, but one that certainly contained an element of truth.
Later, Times reporter Amy Chozick, in her book, "Chasing Hillary," mused on the eagerness for the revelations: "I can't explain it exactly except to compare it to a fever that spread through every newsroom and made us all salivate over the tiniest morsels," Chozick wrote.
She memorably summed up her own decision-making: "I chose the byline. I always chose the byline."
The Times, of course, was far from alone in reporting on the revelations from the Democratic National Committee's internal emails. In fact, it would be hard to find a news organization that didn't publish its plentiful share.
But what about next time a foreign adversary tries to sway American politics though cyberwarfare?
Should reporters and editors refuse to publish newsworthy revelations - such as, in the 2016 hack, Democratic Party officials working to thwart Sen. Bernie Sanders in the primary? (The revelations disrupted the Democratic National Convention and forced the resignation of DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz.)
Or should journalists make decisions on newsworthiness alone? What should they learn?
"The question is an important one because press amplification of the Russian-hacked content is a probable explanation for the 2016 erosion in the public perception that Hillary Clinton was qualified to be president," Kathleen Hall Jamieson, director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania, wrote in a recent Boston Globe piece.
There is no perfect answer. It is, after all, not illegal for journalists to report on stolen information, and it is the press's primary job to tell the public what it can find out about what powerful people and institutions are doing.
But ethical questions abound - and top editors around the country have been grappling with them.
"One takeaway for me is that we should put as much investigative muscle into finding out the source and motivation as we do into the information itself," New York Times Executive Editor Dean Baquet told me.
"That's not always easy in the heat of the moment and the heat of competition." He said, though, that he does not regret publishing revelations from the emails because of their significant newsworthiness.
Washington Post Executive Editor Martin Baron told me, in an email, that The Post's Ellen Nakashima was the first journalist to report, in June 2016, that DNC emails had been hacked and that Russian government hackers were believed to be responsible.
After the hack, he said, The Post was selective in what it published from the available emails, and it repeatedly made clear in its stories that U.S. intelligence officials believed Russia had stolen the emails.
"Our standard was whether they contained information genuinely relevant to the public - voters in this case," Baron said.
In her Globe piece, Jamieson observes that, in general, the news media didn't do a great job of emphasizing where the revelations came from.
And she notes that the recently released Mueller report concludes that Russian intelligence officers gave reporters early access to archives of leaked files by sending links and passwords to pages on the website DCLeaks.com.
She offers a thought experiment:
What if, during the third presidential debate, moderator Chris Wallace had emphasized the source of the emails he was bringing up in a question about Clinton's supposed desire for "open borders" - perhaps like this: "My next question is based on stolen Democratic materials, whose accuracy we have been unable to verify, gotten by Russian hackers through cybertheft"?
Viewers would have been more prone to ask, she suggests, "Why would the Russians and Assange want to defeat the Democratic nominee?"
Julian Assange, who co-founded WikiLeaks - where many of the Democratic emails were first published - is known to be a Clinton antagonist, and Russian officials, we now know beyond a doubt, were working hard to help Donald Trump get elected.
BuzzFeed News has revised its standards guidelines to address hacked material, CNN's Oliver Darcy and Donie O'Sullivan reported last week.
Stories should "treat the intention of the hacker as a major part of the story," said Editor in Chief Ben Smith, and "maintain a high bar for news value."
Columbia Journalism School professor Todd Gitlin told the CNN reporters that "under no circumstances" should hacked material be used "without a clear and unmistakable provenance that can be shared with readers."
That these issues will come around again is almost inevitable. Recall that the 2014 hack of internal emails at Sony Pictures was credibly blamed on North Korea, and that little has happened to inhibit the exponential growth of cyberwarfare worldwide.
Newsrooms need to do everything in their power to be prepared to handle hacked information responsibly and thoughtfully - even in the heat of a breaking news story.
In short: Don't publish weaponized gossip. Verify relentlessly. Nail down, and emphasize, the source of the hack and its motivation. And be transparent with news consumers.
Or be prepared to become, in that dreaded phrase, "the de facto instrument" of a foreign adversary's fondest hopes.

Texto completo: By the time day two headliner Sam Hunt hit the stage at the 13th annual Stagecoach Country Music Festival, the fans were ready to dance at the Empire Polo Club in Indio.
During an interview ahead of the festival, Hunt said he hadn’t played a show in about six months but was ready to get back out to party with his fans at the festival. For a first-time headliner, Hunt’s performance was solid. He came out hard with “Leave the Night On” and transitioned into “House Party,” during which his crew unleashed dozens of giant balloons into the audience, which promptly blew away in the gusty desert winds.
Not all of Hunt’s songs are bangers, though, and he did pick up his acoustic guitar and slow things down a bit with songs like “Take Your Time,” “Cop Car,” a song he wrote for Keith Urban, and he jumped on the piano for “Make You Miss Me” during his encore. The fans danced and sang all the “woah-oh-oh’s” they could in “We Are Tonight,” a song Hunt wrote that was recorded by Billy Currington.
Though he’s not a traditional country artist since he mixes in elements of pop, rock, electronic dance music and R&B into his music, Hunt is a traditionalist at heart. He told the crowd he’d always tip his hat to those who paved the way within the country music genre and invited out fellow Mane Stage player Luke Combs to pay tribute to Brooks & Dunn with a cover of “Brand New Man.” Hunt also paid homage to the late Waylon Jennings with “Belle of the Ball.”
For his first Stagecoach appearance in 2016, Hunt surprised the audience by bringing out G-Eazy, Bebe Rexha and Snoop Dogg during his set, but this year he let his own material shine. After closing out with “Body Like a Back Road,” he did tell the audience he’d see them tomorrow, which might mean he’ll pop up at the festival’s first-ever official after party with EDM artist Diplo at the Palomino Stage after Aldean’s turn on Sunday.
While Luke Combs is an incredible songwriter and his ascent has been a quick one, unlike Hunt he is country through and through. He reminded the Stagecoach crowd when he took the Mane Stage just before Hunt he played this same fest at about 2:30 in the afternoon two years in front of about 1,000 people.
Since then, he’s scored five No. 1 hits and racked up the awards and accolades for songs such as “Hurricane,” “One Number Away” and “She Got the Best of Me,” all of which he put in his Stagecoach set. He also earned his spot, second to headliner, on the Mane Stage in front of 80,000 fans. That fact wasn’t lost on him as he told the crowd “five or six guys on stage get to live their dreams every night” because they spend their hard-earned money to come see them perform at things like Stagecoach.
He’s been touring on this album for some time and hit the audience with a few new songs including “Reasons” and “Beer Never Broke My Heart,” and during the latter he stopped and shotgunned a beer.
Singer-songwriter Cam has clawed her way up with time slots on the Mane Stage and finally landed herself the coveted sunset hour. The 34-year-old California native showed up in a colorful getup with lots of fringe and bedazzle not unlike a pack of Starburst. She opened with her single “Diane,” her fiery nod to Dolly Parton’s “Jolene,” which she included near the end of her set as well. She’s always been bubbly, but on Saturday night she let her personality really shine, engaging with the crowd with more banter and confident interactions. She debuted Diplo’s new song, “So Long,” on which she guests, which dropped earlier this week and hinted that she might be over at his set on Sunday as well.
Before performing her first single, “My Mistake,” she told the crowd that the New York Times once called the song “sex positive,” which she took as a compliment. However, “…when women sing about sex it’s like a statement, but when a man sings about sex it’s just another Friday night,” she told the crowd.
“If you think sex isn’t as important to women as it is to men, than I gotta story about yo’ mama,” she added as the crowd cheered. She came out at the end of her set wearing a bedazzled cape to sing her big hit, “Burning House.”
Meanwhile, Lynyrd Skynyrd became the new record holder for crowd at the Palomino Stage, with fans spilling out of the tent for tens of yards in every direction. The band even outdrew its 2014 audience at the same location. Part of the attraction could be that it’s a last chance to see Southern rock’s defining band, as a long farewell tour wraps this year. And unlike many Palomino players, Lynyrd Skynyrd held the crowd’s attention for the full set.
The 75-minute performance packed in the hits, including “Gimme Three Steps,” “That Smell,” “Simple Man,” “Tuesday’s Gone,” “Don’t Ask Me No Questions,” and “Call Me the Breeze” before ending with “Sweet Home Alabama,” during which the crowd danced and drowned out the band with their own singing. But what would Skynyrd’s final Stagecoach bow be without “Free Bird” as an encore?
Other earlier highlights included Lanco’s fun set with its hits “Greatest Love Story,” “Trouble Maker” and “Born to Love You.” Michael Ray had fans singing along to “One That Got Away” and Jessie James Decker got the Mane Stage going early with covers of Shania Twain’s “Man! I Feel Like a Woman” and Led Zeppelin’s “What Is and What Should Never Be.”

The twilight of America’s mega-media

Texto completo: It’s far too earlier to predict which party will win next year’s election, but not too early to announce the national media as a clear loser in terms of national influence and prestige.
Pew reports that millennials have become as negative about major media as older generations, with their rate of approval dropping from 40% in 2010 to 27% today. Gallup tracks a similar pattern, finding 70% losing trust in the media, including nearly half of Democrats.
As Trump backers never cease to point out, the Mueller report undermined the supposedly rock solid case for “collusion.” Whatever the truth, a solid majority of Americans believe the Russiagate brouhaha was politically motivated. Some progressives, like Rolling Stone’s contributing editor Matt Taibbi, believe Mueller represents “a death-blow for the reputation of the American news media.”
Ironically, Trump, the man the media wanted to bring down, was largely their creation. At a party in 2016, my wife and I were regaled by a CNN account executive crowing about the company’s strategy of using Trump rallies, at the exclusion of others, to boost ratings. Once having created President Frankenstein, CNN then tried to keep up the ratings by chronicling his disposal — which worked for MSNBC which, unlike CNN, never much pretended to be an objective network. Today, CNN’s audience share has fallen below not only leader Fox, but MSNBC, Home and Garden, Discovery and Food networks.
Ideology over journalism
By some estimates some 92 percent of all major network coverage of Trump outside Fox has been negative. This reflects a decay in journalistic standards. When I was a cub reporter at the Washington Post, I once tried to inject my opinion into an article. My editor came back with a remark that “no one gives a [expletive] about what you think.” Today the notion that news reporters should first and foremost inform, letting readers come to their own conclusions, seems almost quaint.
Today, many reporters ride fact-free, neglecting alternative views on such key issues as climate change, where even mild skepticism is ignored, or even the Trump tax cuts. This increasingly ideological cast has been worsened by journalism schools shift toward social justice advocacy; even well-placed writers at The New York Times complain about the stridency of younger journalists shaping coverage to fit their accepted ideological narratives.
The impact of the internet
Once there were bold notions of the internet helping to create an ever-expanding realm of options in the arts and journalism. Instead, as a Harvard study has demonstrated, we have increased geographic concentration of media in deep blue New York, Washington and, to some extent, the Bay Area, while local independent media continues to shrink.
The media’s tendency toward concentration — and ideological uniformity — reflects the dynamics of the tech industry. Google, for example, now controls nearly 90% of search advertising, Facebook almost 80% of mobile social traffic and Amazon about 75% of US e-book sales.
The traditional media now see much of their online sales largely enriching the world’s richest companies, and potential competitors. Pew reports that newsroom employment has dropped by 23% over the past decade. This does not even include the purging of experienced journalists frequently replaced by younger, less expensive and often ideologically driven younger reporters.
How the oligarchs are further undermining the media
Nearly two-thirds of readers now get at least some of their news through Facebook and Google. This dominance is even greater in both the United States and the United Kingdom among millennials who, by some accounts, are almost three times as likely to get their information from these platforms than print, television or radio.
The shift of control to Silicon Valley, located in one of the country’s most left-leaning regions, accentuates the progressive stranglehold on the media. Facebook’s attempts to “curate” content often eliminates conservative views, according to former employees. Over 70% of Americans, notes another recent Pew study, believe social media platforms “censor political views.”
Increasingly, the remnants of the old publishing industry are being bought by the oligarchs — Jeff Bezos’ purchase of the Post in 2013, the 2017 buying of the Atlantic by Laurene Powell Jobs, and last year’s purchase of Time by Marc Benioff, founder of San Francisco-based Salesforce.com. With billions made elsewhere, these media outlets no longer must listen to their diverse readers; Bezos did not buy the Post to defend democracy, as his henchmen insist, but to shape the debate in the nation’s capital.

Conflicts to come
Progressives may savor the media’s leftward tilt, but ultimately oligarchic control poses a direct threat to the grassroots left as well. Bezos’ tool, the Post, widely ridiculed Bernie Sanders in 2016 and will likely do so again. After all, the well-financed and well-liked Sanders, and other similar populists, may, if elected, relieve them of a few billion to fund his proposed “revolution.”
Hopefully, this pervasive group think will spur new alternative media committed to the credo that journalism best serves the public interest by offering unbiased reporting and heterodox opinion, not an ideologically driven algorithm.

Slime convention includes 16-year-old who bought a $45,000 Tesla with slime profits

Texto completo: Some kids play soccer. Other kids make slime. Guess who has more money for college?
Take, for example, Rancho Santa Margarita teen Nick Werfelmann. The Tesoro High student and social media slime sensation just bought a 2019 Tesla Model 3 for $45,000. With cash. He’s 16.
You can meet him Sunday, April 28, at the SoCal Slime Bonanza at The District at Tustin Legacy. He’ll be among 40 of Southern California’s social media slime celebs selling their creations.
Ashley Kua, 16, will also be there. The Valencia girl has 1 million followers on her Instagram account @slimeyoda. Off the top of her head, she said she has about $300,000 in slime profits saved up for college, give or take.
If you are completely confused about how slime turns into money then go online right now and punch in the word slime.
Thousands of videos will pop up: mesmerizing close-ups of hands methodically poking, slapping, stretching and caressing colorful blobs and bowls of slime. This isn’t the gross green slime you see on Nickelodeon, by the way. We’re talking about slime that resembles liquid and makes a splashy sound when you play with it. Slime that is fluffed up with shaving cream or jiggly like Jell-0.
Some slimes are a translucent sea green that you can plunge your hands into, others are like rainbow-colored taffy.
As pretty as they look, the real appeal is the sound they make when they are manipulated. Depending on the ingredients you add (foam beads, Vaseline, instant snow) they might crackle, crunch, or even make a slurping sound. Think of the satisfaction of popping bubble wrap and you get the idea.
Young and old alike have sworn by the therapeutic value of slime videos. Some even say they get an autonomous sensory meridian response: a relaxing tingle, often starting in your scalp and traveling south, triggered by a soft, repetitive sound.
Now, stay alert, because this is where the money comes in. Slimer kids (and most are kids) don’t just make free videos for you to watch; they sell their creations. Nick has sold about 14,000 slimes, he guesses, since making his first video when he was 14 years old — on Feb. 21, 2017 (he has the date memorized). They sell for $5 to $15 (for a 16-ounce container).
Nearly 500,000 fans follow his Instagram accounts @itsslimetyme and @theveganslimer. Most of his customers are girls ages 10 to 15, but he does get comments from older clients saying that playing with his slimes help their anxiety and their arthritis.
Nick’s biggest seller is his Strawberry Twizzler, which smells like strawberry licorice. A video of his hands kneading a giant mound of Strawberry Twizzler has gotten 11 million views.
Perhaps the most viewed slime video of all time, though, was made by a former Riverside waitress named Karina Garcia, a.k.a The Slime Queen, according to a New York Times story.
As of today, a video of her making a 100-pound slime ball has gotten more than 26 million views. When the Times story came out (July 2017), she also had advertising partnerships worth up to $200,000 — a month. But then, she has a YouTube channel with 9 million subscribers.
All slimes, by the way, begin with basic ingredients that are both cheap and easy to find: glue and Borax and food dyes and essential oils. Some of the scents are mouth-watering.
Ashley’s biggest seller is her I Loaf You Puff.
“It literally smells like dinner rolls,” she says. “And it feels super smooth, really velvety.”
Her other top seller is Yummy Gummy Freeze, which smells like tropical fruit and feels cold in your hands, like a Slushee.
The junior at Trinity Classical Academy, a private school in Valencia, dreamed of med school but now that her slime sales are booming she wants to study business or advertising, preferably at Stanford, Duke, University of Pennsylvania or Brown. She’s hoping her slime profits will cover tuition.
Ashley said she got into slime two years ago after seeing a video and instantly feeling relaxed.
“It’s, OK, I have a 10-minute break, let me play with some slime,” she says. “When I’m stressed out, when I feel kind of fidgety, it’s something I can squish; kind of like a stress ball, but better.”
Ashley has sold about 25,000 slimes online and another 15,000 at conventions, mixing up batches when she’s not doing homework or playing in tennis tournaments.
Nick says he ships up to 400 orders a week; thus the Tesla. He uses it to make post office runs.
The car purchase didn’t wipe him out, by the way. He guesses he’s got another $20,000 to $30,000 for college (plus another year of sales before graduating high school). He couldn’t give an exact total because it’s in several accounts and he hasn’t added it all up lately.
The Tesla arrived several weeks ago. In a role reversal, his parents have taken to borrowing it.
“It’s like kinda crazy,” says Nick, who’s only had his driver’s license for eight months. “I just go with the flow. My parents are really supportive.”

Trump denies he ever ordered McGahn to fire Mueller

Texto completo: President Trump denied that he ever instructed former White House counsel Don McGahn to fire special counsel Robert Mueller.

“As has been incorrectly reported by the Fake News Media, I never told then White House Counsel Don McGahn to fire Robert Mueller, even though I had the legal right to do so. If I wanted to fire Mueller, I didn’t need McGahn to do it, I could have done it myself,” Trump tweeted Thursday morning. “Nevertheless,........Mueller was NOT fired and was respectfully allowed to finish his work on what I, and many others, say was an illegal investigation (there was no crime), headed by a Trump hater who was highly conflicted, and a group of 18 VERY ANGRY Democrats. DRAIN THE SWAMP!”
Tweet
The New York Times reported in 2018 that Trump sought to oust Mueller in June 2017. He instructed McGahn to fire Mueller, but McGahn refused to comply with the order and threatened he would step down from his post.

According to the Times, Trump reportedly claimed that there were conflicts of interests that prevented Mueller from carrying out his investigation. He pointed to a dispute concerning fees at Trump’s National Golf Club in Sterling, Va., which prompted Mueller end his membership there.

He also cited the fact Mueller was previously employed by a firm that represented his son-in-law and White House senior adviser, Jared Kushner.

Last week, a redacted version of Mueller’s report was released and concluded that the Trump campaign did not collude with the Kremlin during the 2015 election. But, the report did not clear Trump of obstruction of justice and said Mueller investigated 10 instances of potential obstruction.

In response, House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., moved to subpoena McGahn for testimony and for documents related to obstruction of justice.

“Mr. McGahn is a critical witness to many of the alleged instances of obstruction of justice and other misconduct described in the Mueller report,” Nadler said in a statement last week. “His testimony will help shed further light on the President's attacks on the rule of law, and his attempts to cover up those actions by lying to the American people and requesting others do the same.”

Rep. King says he relates to persecution of Jesus

Texto completo: U.S. Rep. Steve King said that after facing months of criticism for comments in the New York Times about white supremacy and nationalism, he better understands the persecution Jesus Christ felt.
The 4th District representative made the comments in response to a question from the Rev. Pinky Person of the Faith In Christ Fellowship, who told King during a town hall Tuesday in Cherokee that she was concerned that "Christianity is really being persecuted."
"When I have to step down to the floor of the House of Representatives, and look up at those 400-and-some accusers — you know we just passed through Easter and Christ's passion — and I have better insight into what He went through for us, partly because of that experience," King told about 30 attendees the town hall at Western Iowa Tech Community College.
King's "accusers" were fellow members of the U.S. House of Representatives, who took action condemning King after the New York Times published an article quoting him saying, "White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization — how did that language become offensive?"
House Republicans also stripped King of committee assignments after the article.
The Kiron Republican has repeatedly said the New York Times misquoted him or mischaracterized his words.
King said he is proud of the "strong Christian ethic" in the 4th District. He said the United States is a Christian nation because Americans have strong morals and are willing to confess to wrongdoings and ask for forgiveness.
"It's in our culture, it's who we are," he said. "If it were any other way we wouldn't be the America we are, and probably wouldn't be an America at all."
King is a member of the Roman Catholic Church. He said he counts on his faith to get through difficulties in his role.
"In our staff, we've made sure we have solid, faithful people, in Washington and here in the district," he said. "For all that I've been through, and it seems even strange for me to say it, but I am at a certain peace, and it is been because of a lot of prayers for me."
Now, the representative faces multiple primary challenges for the 4th District seat. State Sen. Randy Feenstra, a high-profile challenger, has raised $260,442 since his campaign launched on Jan. 9, while King raised $61,666 between Jan. 1 and March 31, according to Federal Election Commission filings.
King plans to hold his next town hall Thursday at 3 p.m. at the Jefferson Community Golf Course in Jefferson.

Texto completo: While the Mueller report has dominated the news, a number of important events have snuck under the radar.
For example, do you know who is being put in charge of regulating the pork industry to make sure your bacon, ham and pork chops aren't contaminated? The pork industry!
Until now, the USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service has been responsible for food safety regulation. The agency was founded a century ago to combat brutal practices in livestock slaughterhouses, which included the trifecta of maimed slaughterhouse workers, abused animals and health epidemics.
Now the Trump administration has unveiled plans to get rid of about 40 percent of federal pork inspectors and basically let the pork industry regulate itself. What can we do? We can all become vegetarians. Doesn't interest you? How about everyone start keeping kosher?
Or perhaps we can pressure Republicans to ease off on their deregulation efforts. The residents of Flint, Michigan, would support this 100 percent.
For decades, the Flint River was an unregulated dumping ground for local industries. When the city fell into debt, then-Michigan Gov. Rich Snyder oversaw a decision to stop piping in treated water from Detroit, and instead use the Flint River as the city's prime water source.
Officials did not apply anti-corrosive chemicals to the water and lead leached through the pipes. Blood-lead levels in many local children rose dangerously.
Lately, the Trump administration has pushed for self-regulation of offshore oil rigs, while the nuclear industry is eager to slash government safety inspections and handle them itself.
Similar efforts have led to Boeing being allowed to certify the safety tests of its own 737 Max airliners, according to NPR. And that policy has worked like a charm - except for the recent crashes of two such jets that killed 346 passengers. Former and current Boeing employees interviewed by The New York Times describe "a culture that often valued production speed over quality."
But hey, every Boeing plane didn't crash. So stop whining, you big-government socialists!
What's the solution? Let's relocate Congress to Flint. We can whisk them there on a Boeing 737 Max, and offer a nice pork-chop meal on board, followed by a Flint water chaser.
Deregulate that.

Challenging history traces a dismal time; Compressed book covers vast sweep; REVIEW

Texto completo: Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates Jr. felt the first stirrings of what would become his latest book, "Stony the Road: Reconstruction, White Supremacy, and the Rise of Jim Crow," during his 1969-70 sophomore year at Yale. He was enrolled in his first African-American history course - no such classes were given at his high school - and was introduced to Reconstruction, the brief period after the Civil War when blacks exerted their newfound rights and leadership in the former slave states. The course also covered the racist reaction to Reconstruction, known as Redemption, Gates writes, "when the former Confederate states 'redeemed' themselves at the expense of black rights" and took up with vehemence and violence the dictates of white supremacy. "I have connected Reconstruction with Redemption ever since, as the apex and nadir ... of the African American experience."
During that academic year, Gates also took a course on the Harlem Renaissance, a period of black intellectual and artistic ferment from the late 19th century to the mid-1920s; he continued to study that period and the emergence in those years of what became known as the New Negro. "In this book," Gates writes, "I attempt to show that the New Negro was the black community's effort to roll back Redemption, which was itself a rollback to Reconstruction, and to do so by coining a metaphor, of all things, and then by seeking to embody that metaphor." The result is "Stony the Road" - as Gates describes it, "an intellectual and cultural history of black agency and the resistance to and institutionalization of white supremacy." His title is borrowed from James Weldon Johnson's 1900 poem, "Lift Every Voice and Sing," known as the Negro national anthem: "Stony the road we trod/ Bitter the chast'ning rod."
Gates' book covers territory well known to scholars and Civil War buffs: how our received wisdom of the "tragic decade" of Reconstruction flows from two polluted streams, the myth of the Lost Cause and the Jim Crow segregation mania that swept American legislatures and popular entertainment after 1900. For those wishing to know more about this dismal story of racial hysteria in places as high as Woodrow Wilson's White House and as low as the blackface minstrel show, "Stony the Road" is excellent one-stop shopping. With a main text of about 250 pages, Gates offers a compressed yet surprisingly comprehensive narrative sweep, in addition to the usual catalog of political sins, an overview of the lesser-known stories of how our "best" universities, such as Columbia and Harvard, allowed two pseudo-disciplines - "scientific racism" and eugenics - to create a false dogma of black misrule and white suffering at the center of the Reconstruction narrative.
With a dazzling selection of cartoon stereotypes, the author shows that in the white supremacist reaction "all along, the issue had been about the fabrication of hateful imagery in order to justify robbing black people of their constitutional rights and their economic potential."
In tracing the emergence of the New Negro, Gates notes that Booker T. Washington "was named the very first new Negro" by the white press. But Washington was "problematic" - he called for a regime of economic cooperation and social separation as a necessary condition of black progress. Gates observes that Washington was gradually eclipsed by more militant followers of Frederick Douglass and W.E.B. Du Bois. The latter's scholarship in combination with the Harlem Renaissance saw the emergence of a "newer New Negro" and vigorous pursuit of the rights of equal treatment first promised by the Reconstruction Congress that passed the 13th, 14th and 15th amendments.
Gates is at his most fluent in defining the newer Negro as a feature of the Harlem Renaissance powered by Alain Locke, Langston Hughes, James Weldon Johnson and other key figures of the African-American creative pantheon. Locke is depicted as a flawed visionary who believed that artistic achievement would be as sure a path to equality as politics or economics. "They saw themselves as members of the black upper class," Gates writes, "a cosmopolitan mobile elite that could be integrated into American society, even if 'the slow-moving black masses' (as the head of the Urban League Charles S. Johnson would actually call them) could not."
Notwithstanding his high regard for the Renaissance, Gates clearly tilts toward politics, rather than art-for-art's-sake or pure commerce, as the most reliable vehicle for black progress. "No people, in all of human history, has ever been liberated by the creation of art. None," Gates asserts with a sense of certainty that is a signature of his rhetoric.
Analytically, this is a lively, consistently challenging book. I was struck by a sweeping criticism Gates offers in discussing the Harlem Renaissance. He blames Locke's 1925 anthology, "The New Negro," for ignoring "those great geniuses of black vernacular culture, the musicians who created the world's greatest art form in the entire twentieth century - jazz." The grandiose language feels like special pleading, based on personal taste, but Gates usefully reminds us that "jazz and its companion blues," while rooted in black culture, have a unique place in one of modernity's great stories, the African-American experience on the American continent in the previous century. Gates' telling of that story is a contribution to what we ought to be thinking about, given the rocky launch of this newest American century.

Texto completo: For the last year, the investigative journalist Julia Angwin has been busy building The Markup, a nonprofit news site dedicated to scrutinizing technology and its effects on society.
The Markup raised more than $ 23 million in funding, a testament to the reputation that Ms. Angwin, the site's editor in chief, and another of its founders, Jeff Larson, had established through their work at ProPublica, which they left last year. But on Monday evening, Ms. Angwin was fired from The Markup via email, just months before the site's planned July start date. On Tuesday, five of the site's seven editorial staff members resigned, citing her dismissal as the reason.
Ms. Angwin said in a letter to Craig Newmark, the Craigslist founder and the site's biggest donor, that she was being pushed out by Sue Gardner, The Markup's third founder, who is also its executive director and was the head of the Wikimedia Foundation until 2014.
Ms. Gardner wanted to change the site's mission to "one based on advocacy against the tech companies" instead of "producing meaningful data-centered journalism about the impact of technology on society," Ms. Angwin wrote in the letter, which was obtained by The New York Times.
Ms. Gardner disputed that characterization.
"There is no change in the mission or purpose of The Markup," she said in response to questions from The Times. "We are, pure and simple, a news outlet. We always have been and always will be. Our goals and purpose haven't changed."
Ms. Gardner said Tuesday afternoon that the site had issues with Ms. Angwin involving "leadership, management and willingness to accept feedback and training to grow as an editor in chief."
Mr. Larson, who will succeed Ms. Angwin, added that The Markup had hoped to have almost 24 reporters in place and begin publishing by early 2019. He said it wanted to see more progress in areas like recruitment, a process that would allow journalists to pitch story ideas to the site and the amount of publishable work ready to go on the site when it went live.
Asked to respond to the criticism from Ms. Gardner and Mr. Larson, Ms. Angwin pointed to the exodus of the editorial staff after her dismissal. "I feel like the support of the newsroom for my leadership is all the testimony that anyone could ever ask for as a leader," she said.
Ms. Angwin's credentials and vision for the site helped attract interest from journalists, other media outlets and donors, including a $ 20 million gift from Mr. Newmark.
"I'm devastated to be forced out of the organization I conceived to pursue rigorous, evidence-based tech accountability journalism," Ms. Angwin said in an emailed statement. "I will continue to pursue that mission and hope to find other ways to help build this field."
While Ms. Angwin was at ProPublica, the site became known as "big tech's scariest watchdog." Before joining ProPublica, she worked at The Wall Street Journal, where she led a privacy investigative team and was also part of a group that won a Pulitzer Prize for coverage of corporate scandals. She has also written two books, one of which was about privacy.
At ProPublica, Ms. Angwin's team demonstrated how Facebook's ad tools could be used to illegally discriminate against people of certain races, investigated racial bias in criminal sentencing software and examined how African-Americans were overcharged for car insurance. Mr. Larson was generally her partner on investigations, she said on a podcast last fall, where "he's sort of the programmer, I'm the journalist, although I think we're both a little of both."
The circumstances surrounding Ms. Angwin's departure remain a point of contention. Ms. Gardner said the site had started talking with Ms. Angwin in December about creating a new role for her that was not of editor in chief, but that would allow her to "remain the public face of the institution." She added that Ms. Angwin was not open to other jobs at The Markup.
Mr. Larson said, "The Markup attempted to meet with Ms. Angwin in person, and discussions about her role had been ongoing for some time." He added, "This was not abrupt."
Ms. Angwin said she had never been offered other roles or discussed other jobs within the roughly 15-person organization.
The seven members of the editorial staff sent the management and Mr. Newmark a letter supporting Ms. Angwin on Monday, saying, "We joined on to The Markup because we believe in Julia Angwin's work." The letter was posted on Twitter from an account named "The Real Team Markup" on Tuesday.
Five journalists said on Twitter that they had resigned after Ms. Angwin's departure. Mr. Larson said the company had accelerated recruitment and had "multiple other hires in motion," and hoped that the launch would not be delayed.
Mr. Newmark did not respond to requests for comment. A journalist for The Guardian said on Twitter that Mr. Newmark had responded, "I can't ethically comment right now" when she asked him about The Markup at an event on Tuesday.
In her letter to Mr. Newmark, which sought his intervention, Ms. Angwin said Ms. Gardner wanted The Markup to be a "cause" rather than a "publication."
She also said Ms. Gardner had ranked reporters in job interviews according to how negative they were regarding tech companies, viewing that as a favorable trait, and had urged Ms. Angwin to run headlines on future stories like "Facebook is a dumpster fire." Ms. Angwin said her objections had led Ms. Gardner to seek her removal as editor in chief.
Ms. Gardner said in an email that although she regularly asked candidates for their perspectives about technology, in part to gauge how informed they were, "the assertion that more negative takes were 'good' or 'bad' is untrue." She also said she had not urged headlines like the one Ms. Angwin cited.
"Internally at The Markup we've had many conversations about tone and style, which have included kicking around questions about whether we would ever use colloquial language like 'dumpster fire,"' Ms. Gardner said. "This was a hypothetical raised as a question, not an imperative."
On March 29, according to Ms. Angwin's letter, Ms. Gardner asked Ms. Angwin to step down to become a columnist and write opinion articles. She declined, citing her responsibility to pursue the vision she shared with donors and the employees she had hired.
"Julia Angwin is a groundbreaking investigative journalist with a powerful vision and the highest ethics and integrity," Jesse Eisinger, senior reporter and editor at ProPublica, said in an email, noting that he and Ms. Angwin were friends. "Sue Gardner has little to no investigative experience. To fire Angwin is to sign The Markup's death warrant."
Ms. Angwin said in her letter that while Ms. Gardner had promised her an employment contract with job protections for her position as editor in chief, Ms. Gardner had never signed such a contract. The company does not yet have a formal governing board that would be required to weigh in on major management changes.
Mr. Larson was the site's managing editor and had previously worked at The Nation. He is a data journalist who has won a Livingston Award and was on a team that won a Peabody Award. It was a message from Mr. Larson sent on Monday night that officially told staffers the news about Ms. Angwin. It began: "Hey all. I am writing to tell you that Julia Angwin is no longer with The Markup."

Texto completo: In response to Donald Trump's cynical ploy that would send refugees to sanctuary cities like Santa Fe, we choose our hearts and welcome these families with great compassion and humility, with thanks that we are more fortunate. This is a crisis of cruelty and conscience. We call on everyone in our city and our City Council to support this plan.

Right to exist
In contrast to Ellen Shabshai Fox's opinion ("Questioning is good," Letters to the Editor, April 17), criticism of Israel's policies, even severe criticism, has nothing to do with anti-Semitism. It is being done in Israel itself on a daily basis.
But those who deny the right of Israel to exist as the nation-state of the Jewish people and call for its destruction, either directly or indirectly through their support of the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement, are definitely anti-Semites.

Our minds, bodies
Bravo to Cathlynn Groh ("Unless and until," Letters to the Editor, April 16), for pointing out the most obvious fact in John Block's opinion piece ("We'll fight to protect innocent humans," My View, April 14) -- he's a man.
My generation fought people like him
50 years ago, and here we are still fighting the same battle with people -- mostly men -- who continue to want to control what women do with their own bodies. When will people like Block understand the point that the fight is for choice? Pro-choice is the issue here. If you don't want an abortion or assisted suicide or whatever, then don't. As Groh said, "Our bodies, our decision[s]."

Another right -- to vote
As we're seeing since his roll-out recently, South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg will have no shortage of homophobic detractors as we move forward. His skill in deflecting these vile comments is admirable. As far-fetched as an out-gay presidential candidate would have seemed just a couple years ago, Buttigieg epitomizes the same characteristics that made Barack Obama such a successful president.
If given the chance next year, we, the electorate, may have the choice between a man of great moral standing and a man with zero moral standing.

Needing to know
After reading Simon Romero's New York Times article ("Descendants calling attention to history of lynching Latinos in West," March 5), I was shocked and saddened by the abuse my people had to endure, especially the Porvenir Massacre of 1918. I did know that the Anglo-Americans had expected us to leave our land and our homes after the Mexican War and resented that we did not resettle in Mexico, fearing our potential political and economic power; I did not know that their resentment assumed such a murderous magnitude.
I had not been taught these things in school. That reminds me of something my father once told me; he said, "Schools teach children what they want them to know, not what they need to know or should know."

IT'S NOT THE COLLUSION, IT'S THE CORRUPTION WHAT THE MUELLER REPORT SAYS ABOUT OUR WORLD

Texto completo: The Mueller report is like a legal version of a thriller movie in which three malevolent forces are attacking a city all at once. Everybody's wondering if the three attackers are working together. The report concludes that they weren't, but that doesn't make the situation any less scary or the threat any less real. br data-css-regions-fragment-of="1107">
The first force is Donald Trump, who represents a threat to the American systems of governance. Centuries ago, our founders created a system of laws and not men. In our system of government, there are procedures in place, based on certain values - impartiality, respect for institutions, the idea that a public office is a public trust, not a private bauble.
When Mr. Trump appears in the Mueller report, he is often running roughshod over these systems and violating these values. He asks his lawyer to hamper an investigation. He asks his FBI director to take the heat off his allies. He tries to get the relevant investigators fired. I don't know if his actions meet the legal standard of obstruction of justice, but they certainly meet the commonsense standard of interference with justice.
The second force is Russia. If Mr. Trump is a threat to the institutional infrastructure, the Russians are a threat to our informational infrastructure. We knew this already, but it was still startling to see the fact declared so bluntly - that the Russian government interfered in the 2016 election "in sweeping and systematic fashion."
It may not be bombing buildings or shooting at people, but if a foreign government is attacking the factual record on which democracy runs, it is still a sort of warfare. The Russians are trying to undermine the information we use to converse, and the trust that makes conversation possible.
The third force is Julian Assange and WikiLeaks. They are a threat to our deliberative infrastructure. Any organization needs to be able to hold private conversations in order to deliberate. Whether it is State Department cables or Democratic National Committee emails, WikiLeaks has violated privacy and made it harder for institutions to function. We're now in a situation in which some of the worst people on earth get to determine what gets published.
The Mueller report indicates that Mr. Trump was not colluding with Russia. But it also shows that working relationships were beginning to be built, through networkers like Paul Manafort, Donald Trump Jr. and Roger Stone. More important, it shows that many of the Trumpists, the Russians and the WikiLeaks crowd all understood that they were somehow adjacent actors in the same project.
I would say that's the report's central importance. We are being threatened in a very distinct way. The infrastructure of the society is under threat - the procedures that shape government, the credibility of information, the privacy rules that make deliberation possible. And though the Chinese government does not play a big role here, it represents a similar sort of threat - to our intellectual infrastructure, the intellectual property rights that organize innovation.
It is as if somebody is inserting acids into a body that eats away at the ligaments and the tendons.
These forces are motivated by self-interest, but their common feature is an operational nihilism. They are trying to sow disorder at the foundation of society. The goal is not really to convert anybody to a cause; it is to create cynicism and disruption that will open up the space to grab what you want to grab. They rig the system and then tell everybody, "The system is rigged!" And therefore, all values are suspended. Everything is permitted.
br data-css-regions-fragment-of="1117">
As I was reading the report, I thought of a podcast called "Against the Rules" by Michael Lewis. A recent episode jumps off from the way athletes are getting more vicious toward referees. But that's not just true in sport; it's true in society. In all societies there are rules defining good conduct, and there are supposed to be impartial, honest referees that enforce those rules and make sure the game is fair.
And today, across society, two things are happening: Referees are being undermined, and many are abandoning their own impartiality. (Think of the Wall Street regulators, the Supreme Court, the Senate committee chairmen, even many of us in the blessed media.) Things begin to topple.
The system more or less held this time. But that's just because people around Mr. Trump often refused to do what he told them to do. And we happened to have Robert Mueller, who seems to be a fair referee.
The Justice Department has not been defended from political assault. William Barr's news conference before the report's release eroded any claim to impartiality and trustworthiness.
Mr. Trump doesn't seem to have any notion of loyalty to an office. All power in his eye is personal power, and the government is there to serve his Sun God self. He'll continue to trample the proper systems of government.
It's easy to recognize when you are attacked head on. But the U.S. is being attacked from below, at the level of the foundations we take for granted.

Report exposes all the president's liars

Texto completo: Addressing reporters from the White House lectern, press secretary Sarah Sanders made a startling claim shortly after President Donald Trump fired FBI Director James Comey two years ago.
"I've heard from countless members of the FBI that are grateful and thankful for the president's decision," she said, refusing to back down when pressed on the issue. "Between emails, text messages, absolutely," she insisted.
It wasn't true.
She later told prosecutors working for special counsel Robert Mueller that her comments were a "slip of the tongue."
It's a crime to lie to federal investigators or Congress, a lesson that many of Trump's associates found out the hard way. But it's not a crime to lie to reporters and the American people.
The redacted, 448-page Mueller report released Thursday exposed in voluminous detail how the Trump White House is comfortable not only spinning the truth, but outright demolishing it.
Sometimes the president did the lying himself. Sometimes he had others tell lies for him. And sometimes people just lied because they thought it was required of them.
After the president fired Comey, the White House issued a statement saying that Trump had acted on a recommendation from the Justice Department. But Trump had previously decided to sack Comey, and Reince Priebus, then chief of staff, told investigators he believed the president personally dictated the misleading statement.
Days later, when Mueller was appointed special counsel, White House officials told reporters that Trump was undisturbed by the development.
In fact, he was devastated.
"This is terrible. This is the end of my presidency," he said, according to notes taken by an aide.
Trump sometimes lied to his own aides. One episode involved a resignation letter prepared by Jeff Sessions, then the attorney general, who had infuriated Trump by recusing himself from supervising the Russia investigation.
The president decided not to push out Sessions at the time, but he brought the letter with him on a trip to the Middle East, showing it to senior advisers aboard Air Force One.
Priebus was concerned that the president planned to use the letter as leverage over Sessions, and he asked about it during the trip. Trump falsely said the document was back in his White House residence.
Later that year, Trump tried to prevent the truth from coming out about a June 9, 2016, meeting at Trump Tower with a Kremlin-connected lawyer and senior campaign officials.
Hope Hicks, then White House communications director, recalled telling Trump that emails setting up the meeting looked "really bad."
The messages showed that the president's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., was told the lawyer was working on behalf of the Russian government and would bring damaging information on Hillary Clinton. Then Trump Jr. had emailed back, "If it's what you say I love it."
The president "directed aides not to publicly disclose the emails," the report said.
When the meeting was revealed by The New York Times on July 8, 2017, Trump edited a public statement to conceal crucial details. He removed a line admitting the meeting involved someone who "might have information helpful to the campaign," and he emphasized that participants talked about the adoption of Russian children. The statement was issued under Trump Jr.'s name.
The embarrassing emails soon leaked, contradicting the statement dictated by the president, but the lies continued.
"Over the next several days, the president's personal counsel repeatedly and inaccurately denied that the president played any role in drafting Trump Jr.'s statement," the report said.
Once the president's role was revealed, he downplayed the importance of being honest with the public. "It's a statement to The New York Times. That's not a statement to a high tribunal of judges," Trump told reporters.
Pervasive lying is an unsurprising result of having a president whose dishonesty has been a hallmark for years, whether it's exaggerating the height of his buildings or claiming that President Barack Obama wasn't born in the United States. While every White House is accused of dissembling or worse at times,
The report makes clear that Trump leads a White House where falsehoods and misrepresentations are common practice.
Sanders tried to do damage control on her credibility Friday, insisting that her comments after Comey's firing were made in the "heat of the moment" and that she hadn't intentionally misled the American public.
"I said that it was in the heat of the moment, meaning it wasn't a scripted thing," she said on "CBS This Morning." "But the big takeaway here is that the sentiment is 100% accurate."

Deadly deluges of human folly

Texto completo: Recent flooding in the Midwest brought frightening images into blessedly dry living rooms. It also brought a sense of déjà vu: Haven't we seen a lot of these weather disasters lately?
The record says that we have. The leading theory, gathering strength, is that climate change is the reason. Thanks to a warmer, wetter atmosphere, North America can expect more extreme rain and snow events, along with significant flooding.
Literary representations of great floods go back to the stories of Noah and Gilgamesh, emphasizing their mythic hold on the human psyche and our fear of violating some divine order. However, four recent nonfiction books place the blame more directly on human folly.
In his masterful “Rising Tide: the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927 and How it Changed America," John M. Barry blends scientific and cultural history to illuminate one of the nation's worst natural disasters. In a contest to control the Mississippi, two men, James Eads and Andrew Humphreys, squared off repeatedly. Eads, a self-made entrepreneur, sold apples on the streets of St. Louis before developing a successful river salvage operation. The more privileged Humphreys was a West Point graduate known for his ruthlessness as a Union general. Both men had designs on the river, and theories on how best to manage it.
After completing a groundbreaking survey in 1850, Humphreys became head of the Army Corps of Engineers, which officially commanded US waterways. Eads represented the rapidly developing expertise in the private sector. The fight for ascendancy between military and civilian engineers would affect policy well into the 20th century.
Barry's account of evolving flood-control principles will fascinate anyone trying to understand why rising waters still drive so many Americans from their homes. The 1927 flood was made worse by a disastrous “levees-only" policy. It incorrectly held that rapidly flowing waters would dredge their way to the sea, hence any method designed to relieve some of the pressure (outlets, reservoirs etc.) was unnecessary, if not counterproductive. Though neither Ead nor Humphreys endorsed the levees-only idea, it was embraced by bureaucrats who had the power to set policy.
Barry vividly recreates the horrifying result — hundreds died and hundreds of thousands were displaced — but not before exploring the delta region's history, and the cultural forces that upped the ante. (Admirers of the writer Walker Percy will find absorbing material about his family's influence in the years preceding the flood.)
Cultural forces were also decisive when Hurricane Katrina struck New Orleans, in 2005. As in 1927, the Mississippi River defeated the levees meant to contain it. More than 1,000 people died and a million were displaced in the chaotic aftermath. “Katrina: After the Flood," by Gary Rivlin, assesses the recovery. Ten years on, he found a city that had rebounded but in ways favoring the well off. Just as the flood disproportionately damaged black neighborhoods, the rebuilding effort markedly failed black survivors. Rivlin offers a memorable sampling of who behaved well and who didn't. For instance, then-mayor Ray Nagin, who wound up in federal prison, will be remembered for both corruption and incompetence.
Roughly a century before Katrina, a government employee named Isaac Cline was reassigned to New Orleans by the US Weather Service. Cline came from Galveston, Texas — a Gulf coast city that, according to his confident prediction, a hurricane could never strike. One did of course, taking an estimated 8,000 lives in September of 1900. As Erik Larson recounts in “Isaac's Storm," severe flooding joined with high winds to create what remains the nation's deadliest natural disaster.
In Larson's chronicle, Cline becomes a tragic figure whose hubris imparted a mistaken sense of well-being to the people of Galveston. (Children gamboled in the city's rapidly flooding streets, in blissful ignorance of what was to come.) Exiled to New Orleans, Cline became a latter-day Cassandra, advancing our understanding of the role tides play in destructive hurricanes.
By the time of the Galveston flood, many Americans were only too willing to blame arrogant men rather than God for disastrous events. A decade earlier, on May 31, 1889, a dam had burst in the mountains above Johnstown, Pa., inundating the town and killing more than 2,000 people. The destruction was traced to improper repairs, and the repairs to the super rich.
As David McCullough recounts in “The Johnstown Flood," the dam had originally been built to support a canal. In service to an exclusive summer club, it was hastily reconstructed to create a lake. People toiling in the steel mills below heard tales of affluent young people sailing boats high above them. Flood survivors were repelled by the thought that so many lives could be sacrificed to pleasure; in McCullough's Gilded Age morality tale, the revulsion spread, helping to fuel historic labor unrest and usher in an era of reform.
Not long after the Johnstown flood, The New York Times pronounced it “an engineering crime." These ably constructed histories suggest we have not see the end of such disasters — partly owing to nature, partly to us.

Texto completo: The installation by artist-in-residence Theaster Gates allows viewers to pick up framed photos from the archive of Jet and Ebony magazines.

WATERVILLE — Carlos Beason looked forward to visiting his friend’s aunt’s apartment growing up in Harlem, because she subscribed to Jet, a weekly news magazine for black America that began in 1951. In the pages of Jet, Beason saw everyday black people portrayed accurately and fairly. He couldn’t find similar images anywhere else, and looking at the magazine changed how Beason saw himself and his place in the world, as well as his aspirations.
“That publication was the equivalent to my New York Times or Daily News,” said Beason, a 22-year-old senior at Colby College in Waterville. “Those publications didn’t have stories about people who looked like me. Had I not read Jet, I probably would not have believed it was possible for a black person to become president or win Oscars or Grammys or become Miss America or be successful in any career. Or go to Colby College.”
This spring, Beason is talking up a new exhibition at the Colby College Museum of Art that uses thousands of images from Jet and Ebony magazines, filed in and displayed atop open shelves, to contextualize the experience of African Americans like him. The exhibition, “Facsimile Cabinet of Women Origin Stories,” is the latest installation by Theaster Gates, who became an artist in residence at Colby last year and serves as director of artist initiatives at the Lunder Institute for American Art at Colby.
Beason hosted his lacrosse teammates for a tour and talk and is working with other campus groups to do the same. He wants his peers to see this show so they have a better idea of who he is and what America looks like to him. “It’s nice to take the time to look at the images and, after 15 or 20 minutes of reflection, come back as a group and have a better understanding of our place on campus and how we can be better members of the community and simply understand each other better,” he said.
In case you’ve missed the news, Gates is the hottest artist in America right now. In December, The New York Times called him “the style world’s current cultural idol,” a figure so hot that tastemakers Kanye West and Venus Williams sought his counsel during the most recent Art Basel gathering in Miami Beach. He just opened an exhibition in Paris that features the story of Malaga Island in Phippsburg, where a mixed-race community was evicted forcibly by the state of Maine in the early 1900s to improve tourism.
He’s a social-practice artist, which is to say the work he creates comments on society and aims to address social ills. He focuses much of his work in Chicago, his home, where he became famous for turning discarded materials into sculpture and repurposing broken buildings into art centers and neighborhood hubs. In March, he was chosen to participate in Chicago’s Architecture Biennial, a citywide cultural event that’s designed around self-reflection and social justice and civic purpose.
Those themes have been the hallmark of Gates’ work for a long time, and they’re present in the piece at Colby. “Facsimile Cabinet of Women Origin Stories” includes nearly 3,000 images from the archive of the Chicago-based Johnson Publishing Co. That archive may well be the most important archive of the visual culture of black America in the 20th century, museum director Sharon Corwin said. At its height, Johnson was the largest black-owned publisher in the country. In addition to Jet, which began in 1971, Johnson also published Ebony, beginning in 1945. The company sold the magazines in 2016, and last week it filed for bankruptcy in Chicago, formally ending its era and casting this exhibition in somber poignancy.
Gates’ cabinet, installed in the lobby of the museum, honors women and grew out of his “Black Madonna” show last year at the Kunstmuseum Basel in Switzerland, in which he grappled with the death of his mother, Lorine.
“As I reflect on the ‘Facsimile Cabinet,’ I’m reminded that everyday women all over the world have moments when they manifest the divine,” Gates wrote in a statement, emailed in response to questions about the exhibition. “In some ways, the ‘Facsimile Cabinet’ is about citing those women, showing the world what divinity looks like in the Black community. The miracles that Black women perform are not necessarily miracles that we understand from the prophets or the sages, but they’re miracles nonetheless. Holding our countries together, ensuring that our children are safe, healing us, helping us get through school — these everyday acts, which so often go unrecognized, are made plain in the cabinet.”
Gates’ cabinets are installed in the interior lobby of the museum to the left of the main entrance into the galleries. The black walnut cabinets are lined along two walls, and there’s one column that extends into the lobby. The images we are asked to look at aren’t hanging on the walls, but are placed on the shelves of the cabinet, like books on a bookshelf. To consider them, we must don white cotton gloves, remove the framed images from a shelf and place them on an angled surface atop the cabinet. In itself, that act feels reverential, almost spiritual.
The cabinets were custom-built for the exhibition by Maine woodworkers Dan Bloomer and Mark Roman. To provide context for the woodcraft element of the installation, the museum has placed Gates’ piece among wooden sculpture and relief work by Louise Nevelson and Bernard Langlais.
The framed images are reproductions of pictures from the magazines, of the newsmakers, athletes, stars and leaders of the 1960s and 1970s. The activist Coretta Scott King, singer Nancy Wilson and actress Janet MacLachlan are a few random examples. Other images document the working processes of the photographers, designers and editors at the magazines. In addition to the hundreds of finished photographs, we also see contact sheets, crop marks, notes and other indications of artistic practice. Gates licensed the images from Johnson, for use with this and other exhibitions.
With these images and this exhibition, Gates is making the world blacker.
“Can I jump in and assign myself temporary CEO of Johnson Publishing and have that temporary assignment lead to a redeployment of Black images so that people don’t view them as nostalgic, but rather as the ongoing reoccurrence of Black power within the contemporary art world and without?” he asked in his email. “In this way, it is not an intellectual journey of the archive, or my intellectual investigation of Johnson Publishing, in fact, it is just the opposite. It is is my visceral deep desire to occupy the Black image and to see the Black image do positive damage in the world so that the world wants more and more to be Black, to value Blackness, to understand the complexity of the histories of Black Americans, so that the image wins for us all — not just for me.”
Viewers can decide what images they want to spend time with, how many they want to take out from the shelves and whether to return them to the shelves or leave them out for public view. It’s democratic and self-directed at the same time. The idea is to spur questions and investigations.
“Who are these people and what is their story in American history?” said Daisy Desrosiers, director of programs for the Lunder Institute for American Art at the Colby Museum. “It is only through the process of looking that you get to discover the images.”
The hands-on approach is a hallmark of Gates’ artistic practice. At first, visitors aren’t quite sure what to do “with his generous invitation to touch,” Desrosiers said. When they realize they can and must handle the work, their surprise quickly turns to delight, she said. “Part of Theaster’s generosity as an artist, he is offering us a structure. The interaction is up to you.”
This exhibition is a collaboration between the museum and the Lunder Institute. The museum organized and is hosting the exhibition, while the Lunder Institute provides programming and scholarship that amplify it. For “Facsimile Cabinet of Women Origin Stories,” Desrosiers is hosting 15 female scholars from various fields to each spend a day with the collection of images when the museum is closed to the public. The scholars will come one at a time from across New England, and they include artists, copyright attorneys, archivists, anthropologists and documentarians, among others. The idea is to open up the archive to them and allow them the opportunity to explore it, study it and create conversations around it, Desrosiers said.
Desrosiers has enjoyed encountering the women in these photos — and the artists who made these images — at different moments in their lives. As a young black woman from Montreal, Desrosiers has found the archive to be an opportunity for a history lesson, and getting to know it has led to her own self-awareness. “As a young professional, it speaks to who I am in the world and what it means to question your identity and to be evolving and growing through these images,” she said. “You have access to something that opens up your eyes and allows you to meet people and allows you to meet your history in a very different way. It gives me answers and a way into history I did not have access to or did not know. It’s an aesthetic moment I didn’t witness but am glad to know that happened. It’s a huge gift, and one I never get tired of unwrapping.”

Our Rites Of Spring

Texto completo: In the Northern Hemisphere, spring can be defined as the moment the sun glides across the celestial equator in late March. As we tilt toward that wondrous starlight, its rays become more concentrated on our side of the earth, giving us our warmer half of the year.
There is no bigger deal in astrology. It is a powerful season, one defined by cosmic regeneration, "the beginning of rebirth," as the astrologer Chani Nicholas reminded me by text the other day. It embodies more of a new year than the ending of the calendar year, a celestial orientation that manifests in many communities and cultures that observe solar and lunar calendars.
The rituals of spring take on many earthly forms, each revolving around similar themes of liberation and renewal. Passover celebrates the liberation of the Israelites from Egyptian slavery. Easter commemorates the resurrection of Jesus from the dead after his crucifixion by the Romans. Nowruz, the Persian New Year, which translates to English as "new day," marks a time of spiritual prosperity, shedding the past and welcoming a fresh future. In Chinese communities, the festival of Qingming signifies a time for seasonal clearings, including flying kites, outdoor outings and visit to tombs to clean them and leave offerings for ancestors. The ancient Greeks rationalized the warmer seasons as the emotional outgrowth of Demeter, the goddess of fertility and harvest, overjoyed at the return of her daughter Persephone to Olympus from the Underworld. The Aztecs and Toltecs made sacrifices in honor of Xipe Totec, the patron god of seeds, their bloody appeal for a healthy crop for the coming year.
The rites that correspond with this time of year are universal. They transcend era, religion and culture. Above all, the return of the sun means the return of life. It's more than the unsheathing of one season as a means to get to another. Spring is an alchemic time that animates and invigorates all those who honor it with a sense of vitality and growth.
Behavioral scientists have observed the importance of rituals on our ability to help us function and experience positive emotions. Work by Nicholas Hobson and others suggests that even the word "ritual" has more cognitive significance than near-synonyms like "habit" or "routine." Ceremony is integral to our well-being; feeling a part of something bigger than ourselves can alleviate anxiety and help us retain a sense of control amid the chaos of the world. The familiarity is as palliative as the rituals, which echo the cyclical nature of the seasons, of life, of ups and downs.
New Yorkers have a springtime ritual unto themselves. It's called stepping out, and it happens once the city shakes off its barrenness and thaws out. Most humans are heliotropic, or inclined toward the sun, but New Yorkers are especially adept at tracking its movements. The burdens of living in a city that cedes basic human needs like comfort to productivity and efficiency are made exponentially worse by frigid treks to the subway, deceptively deep icy puddles and the indignity of overheated apartments that dry out skin and sinuses.
Spring is more than a ritual -- it's a necessary reminder that these hardships we endure are only temporary. And what better way to celebrate a time of year marked by life and vitality than elaborate rituals of beauty, bodily adornment and anointment? New York is a city of display and voyeurism, and the celebrations that coincide with Easter Sunday make for an ideal moment to observe this phenomenon in full bloom. As the photographers of The New York Times have long documented, our city has made this day into one of collective worship.
The traditions remain the same: Those who are religious head to services and a meal. Those of us who aren't head to brunch, or maybe the park, sporting a freshly pressed suit, an elaborate hat, a big bow, a bright lip, a colorful jumpsuit or one of those delicate beaded Loeffler Randall bags that have suddenly and mysteriously become as ubiquitous as the cherry blossom trees in Brooklyn.
Tina Campt, the author of "Listening to Images," theorizes that photographs are haptic artifacts, capable of transmitting frequencies that can be felt, or heard by the body. "The notion of intimacy is precisely what I'm trying to get at when I'm talking about the haptics of images," she said recently on the podcast "Imagine Otherwise." "Sometimes we feel an active response to an image, but more often there is a passive response of connection."
The faces in these images speak of that connection. They breathe the audible sigh of relief -- and pride -- at surviving another New York City winter. They plan to celebrate by turning out in clothing that reminds them of their aliveness. They have survived and triumphed over another winter in the city, with a beautiful day as their hard-earned trophy.

Texto completo: President Trump has bragged that he has "one of the great memories of all time."
But - when faced with questions from special counsel Robert S. Mueller III about the 2016 campaign - Trump said his memory failed him.
When did Trump learn that his aides had met with a Russian lawyer offering dirt on rival Hillary Clinton?
"I have no recollection," Trump wrote in written responses to Mueller's team.
Did anyone tell Trump during the campaign that Russian President Vladimir Putin supported Trump's candidacy?
"I have no recollection of being told," Trump wrote back.
In at least 37 instances, Trump responded to Mueller's questions - about his campaign's contacts with Russians and about Russian interference in the 2016 election - by saying he couldn't recall.
It was an answer - or non-answer - that Trump had used repeatedly before.
He offered similarly hazy responses when he faced questions in a civil suit about Trump University, when he was pressed about his net worth in a deposition in another case, when reporters asked about his support for the Iraq War, and when he was quizzed about a key Oval Office encounter with then-FBI Director James B. Comey.
In the case of the special counsel investigation, prosecutors found Trump's repeated assertions of a faulty memory "inadequate," according to Mueller's newly released report.
Prosecutors pushed for an in-person interview.
"This is the President's opportunity to voluntarily provide us with information for us to evaluate in the context of all of the evidence we have gathered," they wrote, according to the report.
Trump declined - largely because his lawyers feared the president could misspeak or even lie, The Washington Post has previously reported.
In the end, the special counsel decided not to subpoena Trump for an interview, concerned it could lead to a drawn-out court battle, according to the report.
Trump's attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani did not respond to a request for comment Friday about Trump's memory lapses.
Defense attorneys say there's nothing unusual about a witness - especially one who's the subject of an investigation - claiming not to recall key details. If they forgot, they forgot. And if they actually didn't forget, well, how do you show that someone's lying about the contents of their own mind?
"If they say they don't recall when they actually do recall, that actually is a false statement," and could carry legal penalties, said Jacob S. Frenkel, a former federal prosecutor who now works in the D.C. office of the law firm Dickinson Wright. "The problem is, how do you prove that?"
In the past, Trump has claimed memory lapses in several cases in which he was been asked to account for his own past statements. Instead of explaining them, Trump said he didn't remember making them in the first place.
"You don't remember saying that you have one of the best memories in the world?" an attorney once asked Trump during a 2015 deposition for a lawsuit against Trump University. The plaintiffs alleged that the university - really a series of real estate seminars - misled its customers into paying thousands of dollars for little benefit.
"I don't remember that," Trump responded. He had made the claim just three weeks earlier, in an interview with NBC News.
In that Trump University deposition - when lawyers were pressing Trump about his supervision of the school, starting 10 years earlier - Trump's forgetful response set the tone. He said "I don't remember" more than 30 times, and in 16 other instances responded to questions by saying it had been "too many years."
In that case, Trump later settled the lawsuit for $25 million.
In a 2007 deposition, Trump faced an attorney who wanted him to explain a claim he had made two years earlier to reporter Timothy L. O'Brien. The claim: Trump's net worth was $6 billion.
"You don't recall telling him you were worth $6 billion?" said attorney Andrew Ceresney.
"I do not. I do not," Trump said.
The claim was important in that case because Trump sued O'Brien for defamation, alleging that O'Brien had lowballed Trump's net worth in a book.
O'Brien's defense was intent on proving that Trump was an unreliable source of facts about himself - including about Trump's net worth. As Trump was claiming to be worth $6 billion, his accountants said he was worth less.
To disprove the claim, O'Brien's attorneys first needed to show Trump made it. After Trump said he didn't recall the statement, they produced a tape of the interview.
"What are you worth right now?" O'Brien asked on the tape.
"I would say six" billion, Trump said on the tape.
Trump's lawsuit against O'Brien was later dismissed.
In another lawsuit - this one over a failed plan for a Trump-branded building in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. - Trump claimed to have little memory of his interactions with a business associate named Felix Sater, who led the project. As recently as 2010, Sater had office space inside Trump's executive suites, and a Trump Organization business card. Sater said they had met one-on-one numerous times.
But in a 2013 deposition, Trump said he'd forgotten Sater so thoroughly that, "if he were sitting in the room right now, I really wouldn't know what he looked like."
Trump has repeatedly said he does not recall an episode Mueller scrutinized as a potential act of obstruction of justice: a private Oval Office meeting he had in February 2017 with Comey.
The day before, Trump had fired national security adviser Michael Flynn after reports that he lied about his contacts with the Russian ambassador. According to Comey, the president asked to speak to him alone and then said he wanted to talk about Flynn, who was under investigation.
"I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go," Comey recalled Trump saying. Comey said he did not commit to ending the investigation of Flynn, but took Trump's statement as "a direction."
Trump told the New York Times several months later that he didn't recall having a one-on-one conversation with Comey.
"Not even that I remember. He was sitting, and I don't remember even talking to him about any of this stuff," Trump said to the Times.
The president also denied Comey's account in public, tweeting in December 2017, "I never asked Comey to stop investigating Flynn. Just more Fake News covering another Comey lie!"
But the special counsel found that "substantial evidence" corroborated Comey's account, the report said. Mueller cited as evidence a detailed memo Comey wrote of his encounter with Trump on the day it occurred and the fact that the former FBI director consistently described it under oath before Congress and in interviews with federal investigators.
Other administration officials confirmed to the special counsel that Trump shooed them out of the Oval Office to speak to Comey alone that day, the report said. And just hours before the encounter, Trump told New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) that firing Flynn would put an end to the Russia inquiries, the report said.
But in the end, Mueller was unable to ask Trump about his memory of the Comey meeting: The president's lawyers refused to allow him to answer questions from the special counsel related to possible obstruction while in office.

Texto completo: Dos triángulos de amor, uno trágico y otro relajado, han hecho de “¡Oklahoma!” uno de los musicales más resistentes al tiempo , desde su estreno en marzo de 1943, hace exactamente 76 años, como la primera colaboración entre el compositor Richard Rodgers y el libretista Oscar Hammerstein.
Ahora está de vuelta en Broadway, igualmente ambientado en 1906, pero con giros muy contemporáneos a la sociopolítica y el mercadeo el siglo XXI: mujeres liberales, una pareja protagónica es biracial -ella negra, él blanco-; y en el elenco hay una actriz en silla de ruedas (Ali Stroker), algo inédito en el teatro musical de Nueva York, y que la coloca en ruta a las nominaciones a los premios.
Stroker es una actriz rumbo a los 32 años, nativa de Ridgewood, Nueva Jersey . A los 2 años un accidente de tránsito la dejó paralizada de la cintura para abajo, debido a una lesión de la médula espinal. Pero ello no detuvo la meta profesional que se fijó desde que, a los 7 años, vio un primer musical de Broadway.
Estudió y en 2009 se convirtió en la primera actriz en silla de ruedas en obtener un título del Departamento de Teatro de Tisch de la Universidad de Nueva York , con un título en Bellas Artes. Que se sepa, es la primera intérprete en silla de ruedas en un musical de Broadway, donde como todos debe cantar, bailar y actuar.
Su rol (Ado Annie) no es nada sumiso, al contrario, es el personaje femenino más liberal, infiel y pícaro en la trama. Las críticas han sido muy favorables a todo el equipo, e incluso con ironía Ben Brantley escribió en The New York Times, “¿Cómo es posible que el nuevo show más genial de Broadway en 2019 sea un musical de 1943?”
Además se está presentando en una sala muy peculiar, Circle in the Square , que coloca al público cerca de los actores, planteando un reto adicional para el director, Daniel Fish, apoyado en una interesante iluminación de Scott Zielinski.
Aquí la audiencia no está al frente, sino alrededor del escenario, que es más largo que ancho. Para lograr más interacción aún, los presentes son invitados a probar, en el intermedio, la comida que los personajes “cocinan” durante el primer acto.
Este musical “country” o rural está basado en la obra “Green Grow the Lilacs” (1931) de Lynn Riggs, autor de sangre indígena cherokee. Se centra en la vida sencilla de unos granjeros y vaqueros , mayormente ingenuos, celosos y conservadores, amantes de la caza, los caballos, el baile y el alcohol, y para quienes el honor siempre está a un balazo de distancia.
No son en esencia violentos, sino simples en su manera de ver el mundo y resolver los problemas en la mentalidad de 1906, vigente hoy en muchas zonas rurales en EEUU. En ese entonces, Oklahoma aún no era un estado, sino un “territorio de reserva indígena”.
Las coreografías originales se mantienen simples, mayormente integradas a la trama, cuando los personajes celebran en algún establo dentro de su rutina de “pueblo pequeño, infierno grande”, donde la amistad se debate entre camaradería, celos, amor, venganza y envidia. Así, una boda puede mutar a un funeral y luego a un juicio penal, pues también son rápidos a la hora de imponer justicia, al estilo “Fuenteovejuna” (1619) de Lope de Vega.
En su largo periplo, “¡Oklahoma!” fue adaptada al cine y ganó dos premios Óscars en rubros técnicos en 1955, entre cuatro nominaciones. También se ha producido para TV y teatro en varias ocasiones y lugares. En Broadway estuvo por última vez en 2002 y el estreno actual es la 6ta producción en Nueva York.
La más exitosa fue la primera, que sumó 2.212 presentaciones en poco más de cinco años, aliviando los horrores de la 2da Guerra Mundial. Esta vez el calendario es limitado, sólo de abril al 1 de septiembre.

Heisler: Lakers sticking with family, but Kobe Bryant won’t be riding to the rescue

Texto completo: Imagine that. Playoff thrills locally, after all.
It was supposed to be over by now. The Lakers left us months ago except for their managerial meltdown. The Clippers were supposed to be finished off by Golden State before anyone noticed they were in the postseason.
Instead, in yet another miracle, the Clippers staged the biggest playoff comeback in NBA history, coming from 31 down to win Game 2 in Oakland to make a series of it, after making a season of it when no one expected that.
Or, as Coach Doc Rivers told his players: “We don’t die. We multiply. We’re like roaches.”
Whatever they are, they have a promising future as well as a lot of heart, about to pursue Kevin Durant and Kawhi Leonard with salary cap space, with charismatic figures such as Rivers and Jerry West to lead their recruiting effort and an inspiring story to tell.
Then there are the Lakers … or there would be if they weren’t in hiding.
Since Magic Johnson dropped the big one on them – 12 days ago – no team official has appeared in public. This suggests its own message:
The Lakers’ road ahead involves massive secrecy and an inability to handle hard times?
Suggesting how overwhelmed Jeanie Buss is, she hasn’t told her people to make an appearance, or said anything herself, other than her flowery Twitter paean to Johnson (“Earvin, I loved working side by side with you. You’ve brought us a long way. We will continue the journey. We love you.”)
Did Jeanie miss the one about someone trying to pin the blame for drafting Lonzo Ball on her?
Oh, well, kids fight in the best of families.
There has been no sign of General Manager Rob Pelinka, whom Buss is standing by after Magic reportedly tried to fire him for “back-stabbing” him.
LeBron James, the mainstay of social media, has yet to mention Magic’s departure or his own hopes going forward.
Of course, no one has glimpsed the secretive Kobe Bryant, who declined Jeanie’s offer to take over with Magic in 2017 and doesn’t look interested in doing it now.
If no one knows what’s going on, it’s likely that she has reached out to Bryant.
A source says Kobe’s importance to Jeanie explains why Pelinka, Kobe’s former agent whom Magic gored, remains in place with enhanced powers and no thought of replacing him.
Elsewhere, Pelinka is regarded with open skepticism. The New York Times’ Marc Stein called him “a polarizing figure” with “numerous reports of trust issues – not only in his dealings with other teams and former rivals in the agent world but also former Lakers players (Larry Nance Jr. and Andrew Bogut) who were jettisoned after broken promises.”
Actually, “broken promises,” or reassurances that don’t turn out to be true, are common enough for GMs.
Nevertheless, Pelinka did, indeed, have a controversy-filled career as an agent. Now in the bullseye after Magic’s accusations – if only for joking, “Where’s Earvin?” – the buzzards have come home to roost.
As for any hope that Bryant will ride to the rescue, he’s not one to agonize about decisions. If he had any interest in taking over, we would have heard about it by now.
Kobe isn’t taking questions about it but did in March, telling Slam Magazine’s Tzvi Twersky, “The answer is no, I’m not doing it.
“I’m not interested … not even (for) a couple years. I’m just not interested. I don’t want to be a GM. I don’t want to own a team. I don’t want to coach. I have no interest in any of that. That’s an easy answer for me.”
Of course, Kobe might still be in the loop, even if he has no desire to run anything day by day. As such, he’s like the man behind the curtain in “The Wizard of Oz.”
Whether Kobe’s counsel is helpful remains to be seen. Bold and intelligent as he is, he has no experience running teams and enthusiastically endorsed Magic’s half-baked idea about not needing shooters.
In a perfect irony, there is one former Lakers great who’s still in the game and would have been invaluable. Of course, that’s West, whom the Lakers – presumably, Magic – declined to hire when he was hoping to be invited back.
Jeanie is widely considered good people, but her obsession with Lakers Family … which she treasures as her birthright from the father she worshiped … keeps her from thinking clearly, or at all.
Outside her cocoon, it looks like they’ve gone as far as they can with former Lakers … the approach that backfired so badly with Magic proving temperamentally unsuited to his job … but it’s continuing.
With the Lakers’ marquee stature and the vast resources conferred by a $3 billion TV deal, they should attract top management people like Golden State GM Bob Myers, San Antonio’s R.C. Buford, Oklahoma City’s Sam Presti or Houston’s Daryl Morey.
Reaching out to them would have meant asking their teams for permission. Nothing like that happened.
The well-regarded David Griffin, a LeBron ally as Cleveland GM, was available. With no Lakers interest, he accepted a job with New Orleans days after Magic stepped down.
“Jeanie is great,” a GM said, “but she is too insulated and has made no effort to expand her knowledge base outside the Laker family. They won’t get A.D. (Anthony Davis) because they don’t have the best package.”
Ominously for whoever’s in charge, the Lakers’ scheduled return to greatness is based on acquiring Davis in a trade with New Orleans, which looks ever-more problematic.
For months, I wrote the Lakers were the favorites as A.D.’s preferred destination. Now NBA people say several Western Conference contenders, desperate at being capped by the Warriors, could make attractive offers without assurances he will re-sign in the summer of 2020.
Teams never used to run such risks, but things have changed.
Toronto did it a year ago, trading DeMar DeRozan to San Antonio for Leonard.
Presti did it two years ago, trading Victor Oladipo and Domantas Sabonis to Indiana for Paul George, who was supposedly Lakers-bound but re-signed in OKC. If that wasn’t enough, Presti might be ready to offer Steven Adams for A.D.
Houston, run by Morey, another tightrope walker, could offer Clint Capela.
Meanwhile, in Portland, Trail Blazers players are wooing A.D. openly, as if they were Lakers.
“I’m saying, ‘OK, Anthony Davis, we’ve got a winning culture. We win. We’re not jealous of each other. We have a good time,’ ” Damian Lillard told The Ringer.
“He’ll win. He’ll get to be himself and he’ll get to be on a team that fits. I think he would be perfect for us.”
By week’s end, the Warriors had reasserted themselves, leading the Clippers by 36 in Game 3 at Staples Center and winning by 27, showing what happens when you get them mad.
Still, it was magical for the Clippers, if only for the three days between Games 2 and 3.
As for the Lakers, everyone might have to scale down hopes. At present, their fans just want to make sure they haven’t left town.

Cal Thomas: The exception that is Costa Rica

Texto completo: LIBERIA, Costa Rica — In the ongoing U.S. debate about immigration, the Central American countries of Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala are mainly in the news because many of those crossing our border from Mexico are from these nations. Why isn’t Costa Rica experiencing a similar mass exodus?
I put the question to President Carlos Alvarado Quesada. In an email response he writes in part, “8 percent of our GDP is dedicated to education and our main resource is the human talent and well-being of the people who live in our country. Next Monday, for example, we will celebrate 150 years of primary education for free for all kids in the country.”
Many of those fleeing other Central American countries claim to feel threatened by gangs and crime. Costa Rica has had a lower crime rate than others in the region, but that may be about to change.
According to the Costa Rica Star newspaper, the government and tourism industry started paying more attention to crime when “two female foreign tourists were killed in two days last year, and a third was raped a week later, all near Tortuguero National Park.” The Costa Rican homicide rate has been rising steadily. There were 603 murders in 2017, although figures are lower than in other Central American countries.
Costa Rica is experiencing its own immigration challenge. The New York Times reported last September, “Since mid-April, when Nicaragua erupted in a violent political crisis that has left hundreds dead and crippled the economy, Nicaraguans have been leaving their country en masse — some fleeing a crackdown by President Daniel Ortega against his opponents, others — newly unemployed — desperately looking for work. Many thousands have headed to Costa Rica…”
In fact, writes QCostaRica.com, “Costa Rica has the highest percentage of immigrants in Central America, according to the study Labor Market and Social Policies, of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).”
Tourism is the main economic driver here. The government is concerned any perception it is unsafe to visit might cause serious financial harm.
The Heritage Foundation’s 2018 economic freedom rankings place Costa Rica 61st under the category “moderately free,” although President Alvarado references The Economist, which ranks his country “among the strongest 20 democracies in the world.”
While acknowledging The Economist’s ranking, Anthony Kim of the Heritage Foundation comments, “the country needs deeper institutional reforms for more dynamic development of a broader private sector. Despite progress, excessive government bureaucracy still discourages entrepreneurial activity, slowing the pace of privatization and fiscal reform. Widening budget deficits have put public debt on an upward trend, just to name a few economic policy shortcomings. Costa Rica can do more in terms of implementing pro-growth policies and needed economic reforms.”
Not many people are leaving Costa Rica. It has the lowest emigration rate in Central America and one of the lowest in Latin America and the Caribbean. And though the unemployment rate is 9.30 percent and about 20 percent of the population lives in poverty, Costa Ricans stay put.
Part of the reason may be a new anti-poverty program introduced by the previous president, Luis Guillermo Solis. Its goal is to pull at least 54,600 targeted families out of poverty. The plan combines previous welfare benefits that have been, reports the Tico Times, “distributed through 30 separate programs, administered by 20 different agencies.” Families are to be assessed according to their needs and not a-one-size-fits-all formula. Job training and education scholarships are part of the plan so that poverty doesn’t become a life sentence.
President Alvarado, 39, and a center-leftist, has different priorities. The major issue in the last election was same-sex marriage. The former president opposed it, while Mr. Alvarado supports it.
Mr. Alvarado is also a disciple of the climate-change movement. His goal is to achieve zero net carbon emissions by 2020.
How a small country like Costa Rica — or even a larger one like the United States — can affect the globe’s naturally changing temperatures — especially when major polluters like China, India and, yes, the United States aren’t doing much to reduce carbon emissions — is never addressed. For the left, intentions count, not results.
Crime control and maintaining a vibrant tourist industry seem to be better and more attainable goals than changing the climate and promoting same-sex marriage.

Texto completo: Illustration The 18-year-old Sol Pais of Florida made threats which caused hundreds of schools across Colorado to close on Wednesday. She was found dead with a self-inflicted gunshot wound near the base of Mount Evans on Wednesday morning.

Students are back in class after the "massive manhunt" for an 18-year-old Florida woman who caused hundreds of schools in Colorado to close on Wednesday after the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) confirmed she made threats to the safety of students in the Denver Metro Area came to an end early Wednesday morning.
Sol Pais was located by a tactical team from the Clear Creek County Sheriff's office near the base of Mount Evans with a self-inflicted gunshot wound on Wednesday morning.
"We can confirm that Sol Pais is deceased," the Bureau tweeted on Wednesday. "We are grateful to everyone who submitted tips and to all our law enforcement partners for their efforts in keeping our community safe."
Authorities stated that it was Pais' presence in the state that caused more than 20 schools in Jefferson County to go on lockdown on Tuesday and to close the following day.
At a news conference Tuesday night, Special Agent Dean Phillips, the man in charge of the FBI in Denver, said that his office was tipped off about the threat of Pais by the Miami FBI office. He said she flew into Denver on Monday night, bought a pump-action shotgun and ammunition, and then went to the foothills of Jefferson County.
"Because of her comments and her actions, because of her travel here to the state, because of her procurement of a weapon immediately upon arriving here, we consider her to be a credible threat, certainly to the community and, potentially, to schools," Phillips said.
An FBI bulletin sent to local law enforcement agencies on Tuesday stated that Pais was "infatuated" with the Columbine High School massacre that happened 20 years ago this Saturday. Details about her infatuation with the shooting are still unknown as authorities have not yet expanded on this statement.
After Pais was still not located on Tuesday, hundreds of districts across the Denver Metro Area and beyond, including Estes Park School District, made the decision to close their schools on Wednesday.
In a letter from Denver Public Schools, District Spokesman Will Jones said superintendents from across the metro area assessed the threat and decided it was appropriate to close schools on Wednesday.
"The decision was based on information provided by law enforcement and analysis provided by threat assessment experts," Jones said.
Estes Park School District made the decision to close its schools Wednesday as a safety precaution for its students.
"Though Estes Park is not in the Metro Denver area, we made the decision to close out of an abundance of caution, and with the utmost concern for the safety and well-being of our students and staff," the school district wrote in a Facebook post.
With students back in the classroom, the district said in a letter sent out to parents on Wednesday night that there will be a larger than usual law enforcement presence on campus as a furthered safety measure.
Though the threat has subsided, there will be heightened safety and security measures in place," the letter states. "You can expect to see extra law enforcement presence on campus. We do not provide all of our security details to the public but know that staff will be extra vigilant. Your children are well protected.
Pais' threats come just days before the 20th anniversary of the Columbine High School massacre where two students shot and killed 12 of their classmates and a teacher.
The New York Times reported that Pais' parents reported her missing to authorities in Florida on Monday. According to reports, she was a senior at Miami Beach Senior High School.
Clear Creek County Sheriff Rick Albers stated that Pais' body was found near Echo Lake after she took a rideshare to a lodge by the lake on Wednesday. She then hiked about a half mile from the lodge in knee-deep snow before turning a gun on herself.
She was wearing the same clothes that she was described in - boots, camouflage pants and a black T-shirt.

Looking at the meaning behind Dennard's 'privilege' comments

Texto completo: Cincinnati City Councilwoman Tamaya Dennard's Twitter comments on Tuesday about the cathedral fire in Paris created quite a stir.
Society's immense response to the fire was a "prime example of privilege," the Democrat said, pointing out that she believed the reaction to fires at black churches in Louisiana earlier this year wasn't met with the same attention and sense of loss.
Enquirer Opinion Editor Kevin S. Aldridge and political columnist Jason Williams shared their thoughts on the councilwoman's social media comments:
Aldridge: My initial thought was I understood the sentiment of what Dennard was trying to say, but I felt her overall point was going to get lost in the comparison that she made. The Notre Dame Cathedral is this historic, iconic, world treasure that is tough for most people to compare to three black churches in Louisiana. That's not to downplay the historical significance of those churches, but the profile is simply not the same on a larger scale. She still makes a valid overall point about the disparity that exists when it comes to media coverage of tragedies. What was your initial reaction?
Williams: Looking at this through the political prism, sadly, it's where we're at in American politics. It's another politician saying something outrageous in order to generate attention and pander to a base. It's happening on the fringes on both sides. Think Donald Trump and Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez. Some politicians don't care how ridiculous or irresponsible their rhetoric is, because they know their diehard supporters will defend them no matter what.
Aldridge: Yes, if you look at this purely through a political lens, we can agree that this may not have been the safest or smartest comment to make. Given how passionately people feel about Notre Dame Cathedral and what it means to so many people around the world, Dennard's comments come off as insensitive or divisive. But when you view it through the experience of an African-American who has endured tragedy after tragedy and other acts of racism that get very little love and attention from the media or the public, her point is well-taken. I won't profess to say I know Dennard well, but she seems to fashion herself as a voice for the disenfranchised. I don't think she was trying to grab headlines so much as expressing the frustration that many African-Americans feel with the lack of attention given to major news events that impact African-Americans.
Williams: I'm sensitive to the racial element. To me, the burning down of the churches in Louisiana is way worse. Someone blatantly burned down those churches out of pure hate. That's sickening. It's heartbreaking. I saw quite a bit of media coverage of the Louisiana fires. The New York Times has been all over it, so the story has gotten national attention. However, I'm struggling to see why there's any comparison being made between Paris and Louisiana. There's simply more attention on the cathedral fire because it's an 850-year-old international icon that's a symbol of a popular, worldwide religion. More than 10 million people from across the globe visit the landmark each year. So if I express sadness about a world-renowned building burning, what the hell does that have to do with the color of my skin? Come on. I understand the need to get outraged and make comparisons in order to offer context at times, but this wasn't it.
Aldridge: As I said in my initial comments, one of the reasons I cringed is because I knew Dennard's overall point would be lost simply because of the vehicle in which she was using to make it. It's similar to the Colin Kaepernick national anthem protests. Kaepernick's point about the need to address police brutality among African-Americans is no less valid because of the manner in which he used to highlight it. I think Dennard's point was not to compare three black churches in Louisiana and the cathedral. The Louisiana church burnings invoke historical images of racist crimes committed in the Jim Crow South. It's not about the buildings, but the significance of each events.
Williams: Great point. When you put it that way, it really helps to simplify this and put it into perspective. Personally, I'm much more outraged about the Louisiana fires. I long for the day of racial healing and reconciliation in this nation. I'm typically more concerned about what's going on in my home country. I'm not Catholic. I'm not into architecture and religious history, so I felt no connection to the cathedral fire. Completely separate from that, though, I'm having a hard time seeing how Dennard's comments serve the greater good. In the post-Trump world, when an elected official makes outrageous comments like this, it tends to polarize everyone. It becomes us-vs.-them, and any hope of a healthy debate vanishes. Many times – perhaps unfortunately – people automatically view the elected official through a partisan lens. And social media posts like Dennard's only serve to throw gas on the fire.
Aldridge: That's one of the reasons why I dislike social media. 280 characters doesn't leave a lot of room for nuance or context. Our elected officials must be more thoughtful and comprehensive with their remarks in this age of soundbites and knee-jerk reactions. That doesn't mean they shouldn't feel free to speak their minds or tell their truths. There are difficult conversations that we need to have, and I can respect elected officials pushing us to have them. People can handle hearing hard truths, but the reality is the delivery still matters.

Texto completo: Justin Chae woke up from a nap 10 minutes after Stanford University let early-action applicants for the freshman class of 2023 know whether they'd been admitted. With his camera perched next to him, Chae opened up his laptop.
"You know what they say," Chae said to the camera. "Hope for the best, expect the worst. So, let's see how this goes."
It was December. Chae, who is 17, is a senior in high school in Dallas. He was one of the millions of kids who refresh their inboxes every spring in anticipation of a fateful letter from college admissions officers. It's usually a moment of private drama for students, their families and friends, but Chae planned to share his with the world by filming his reaction to the decisions from the five colleges he'd applied to attend. Then he would post the recordings to YouTube.
Stanford was the first. Still sitting on his bed, Chae clicked the "status update" on his Stanford account. A letter popped up on the screen. For a second, Chae said nothing.
"Okay, so, rejected from Stanford," he said finally. "Um, that was expected. Yeah. Okay."
He would have to wait until March to hear from the others. When it was all over, he would edit the videos together and post all of his reactions as a kind of highlight reel - or maybe lowlight reel, depending on how it all turned out.
Social media is filled with content that celebrates (and sells) the college experience, from dorm room tours to "day in the life" videos to productivity tips. Rich influencers like Olivia Jade Giannulli - whose famous parents, actress Lori Loughlin and designer Mossimo Giannulli, pleaded not guilty to charges stemming from a college admissions bribery scam this week - branded themselves as relatable college students, albeit ones with millions of followers and dorm rooms paid for by Amazon.
Reaction videos from non-celebrities, like Chae, offer a different kind of relatability. Some of the viewers are high school juniors and sophomores who are beginning the long process of applying to college themselves. For that audience, the videos aren't just good content, they're glimpses into the future - not the heightened version of their dreams and nightmares but vérité depictions of acceptance and rejection as it happens.
That's how it was for Chae, who watched a few reaction videos before he started applying to colleges.
"It's almost infectious seeing people freak out when they get accepted and you can't help but smile and be happy for them," he said in an email to The Washington Post.
But the rejections were valuable, too. They helped motivate him to submit long-shot applications to some of the top schools in the country, Chae says. "I realized that even if I also got rejected, it wouldn't be the end of the world and I would end up in the right place in the end."
He had to live with the Stanford rejection all winter. Finally, an email came from the University of Texas at Austin. Chae pointed his camera at his laptop and clicked on the link. The glare from the screen makes it hard to see the text, but his whoop makes it clear. "Let's go!" he says, grinning and pumping his fist. Then the University of Southern California posted a rejection. The Ivy League schools were next. Yale? R ejected . Columbia? Rejected . Finally, he clicked a link from Princeton that left him speechless.
"CONGRATULATIONS!" it began. Chae held his hand to his mouth, which was agape, and looked directly at the camera with an expression of pure joy.
His video has more than 300,000 views.
Every year, dozens of students post videos like Chae's to YouTube. In one, a high school senior sits at her computer screen openly weeping as she is rejected on Ivy Day from Harvard, Yale, Columbia and Brown. The only college left is her top choice, the University of Pennsylvania. "I'm freaking out," she says, as her family around her comforts her.
She clicks. She screams. She got in.
That video, from 2018, has more than 1 million views. In another video, a dad pops into frame, whistling with his fingers in celebration as his daughter opens a letter announcing her acceptance to Georgetown. In another, a student who says he's a legacy at Cornell is so excited about his acceptance there that he brings his camera outside to film himself doing a front flip into a swimming pool.
Not all popular college reaction videos end with a dream coming true. A disturbingly world-weary high school senior filmed himself opening up all his college decisions at once. The first is Amherst. He looks at the screen, smiles and claps once. "Fantastic," he says. "So I got rejected from Amherst. Next college. Next college!" The rest of the video is much the same, as the student casually leafs from one rejection to the next. (He does get into Carleton College and the University of California at Los Angeles.)
Another video shows a student wearing a Northwestern sweatshirt as he checks his application there. As he finds out he's rejected, he removes the sweatshirt.
The authenticity of the college reaction genre is, like anything viral, primed for possible exploitation. A series of reaction videos from T.M. Landry, a prep school in Louisiana, attracted millions of views from those who were inspired by the nearly identical footage of students sitting at a laptop, surrounded by their classmates, finding out that they'd been accepted to some of the top schools in the nation. But the school is now the subject of a Louisiana state police investigation, after the New York Times reported allegations that the school helped students win acceptance to those colleges with "falsified transcripts, made up student accomplishments" and other misdeeds that "mined the worst stereotypes of black America to manufacture up-from-hardship tales that it sold to Ivy League schools hungry for diversity." (The school released an internal investigation days ago disputing some portion of the Times's reporting, stating that the prep school "appears to have been a genuine incubator for success.")
But most reaction videos appear to be amateur productions without any shady underpinnings. For Nina Wang, an 18-year-old senior from Massachusetts, the decision to document the big moment almost made itself.
"I decided to film my own," she said, "simply because I watched so many others (like, so so so many)."
Now, so so so many people have watched her video, which has hundreds of thousands of views.
That puts her in the same category of quasi-celebrity as Justin Chae. He's off to Princeton (although, he said, he hasn't yet officially accepted the offer of admission), and thousands of strangers know it.
Chae wants to keep making videos documenting his college life. He's already mastered the art of the follow-up: "SURPRISING MY MOM WITH MY ACCEPTANCE TO PRINCETON," a video showing Chae springing the news on his mom at her workplace, already has more than 100,000 views.

Why 'tax the rich' demands are unreasonable

Texto completo: If I told you there was a movement to create a navy or air force, you might respond, "Don't we already have those?" If I said we need a movement to convince bears to relieve themselves in the woods, you might say, "Wait. Isn't that happening already?
But if I said we needed to tax the rich, a lot of people's first reaction would be, "Yes! It's about time!"
In fact, there's an astroturf movement based on precisely this notion. There was just a big conference, fittingly named the "Tax the Rich!" conference, hosted by a group called Patriotic Millionaires.
"Tax the Rich. Save America. Yes, it really is that simple," they explain in their mission statement.
This slogan is simply dishonest; rich people do, in fact, pay taxes. Just under half (48 percent) of federal revenue comes from income taxes. If you define the rich as the top 1 percent -- which is probably too narrow, depending on the region of the country -- the rich pay a big chunk of that. In 2016, according to the Tax Foundation, the top 1 percent accounted for 37.3 percent of all income tax revenue, a share that was greater than the bottom 90 percent of all payers of income tax combined. The top half of taxpayers paid 97 percent of income taxes.
The Tax Policy Center estimates that 44 percent of Americans won't pay any federal income taxes for 2018. That doesn't mean they don't pay any taxes, of course. Payroll taxes eat up a big chunk of many Americans paychecks -- a fact we all learn the first time we shout, "Who the hell is FICA!?"
But the income tax is remarkably progressive. Once again citing the Tax Policy Center (a joint project of two left-of-center think tanks: the Brookings Institution and the Urban Institute), Americans in the top 20 percent paid an estimated 87 percent of income taxes for 2018. This was up from 84 percent in 2017, which means that the "Trump tax cuts" actually made the tax code more progressive.
The folks shouting "Tax the rich!" know this, which is why, when they move beyond sloganeering, they say that what they really want is for the rich to "pay their fair share." This is a more debatable claim because "fair" is in the eye of the beholder. It's not preposterous to argue that the rich, however defined, should pay a few percentage points more in income tax in the name of fairness. But it's also not preposterous to say that when 1 percent of the people provide more than a third of income tax revenue, they're already paying their fair share -- and suggesting that people who don't want to pay even more are "unpatriotic" is bullying nonsense.
While we're on the topic of fairness, there's another common argument for hiking income taxes for the wealthy, or for even simply taxing wealth itself: The rich deserve it. Or, to be more generous, the super-rich don't deserve their money, while the rest of the country does.
The New York Times' Farhad Manjoo recently argued for "abolishing" billionaires outright. Presidential candidates Elizabeth Warren and Beto O'Rourke say we should make the rich less rich because income inequality is bad. Candidate Bernie Sanders and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (and many others) think that everything from Medicare for All to the Green New Deal can be financed largely -- or entirely -- by pillaging the bank accounts of the rich.
This is populist insanity masquerading as public finance. According the Manhattan Institute's Brian Riedl, doubling the top tax brackets (from 35 and 37 percent to 70 and 74 percent) "would close just one-fifth of the long-term Social Security and Medicare shortfall. Even seizing all annual income earned over $500,000 would not come close."
You could literally confiscate 100 percent of the wealth of the entire one percent and not come close to paying for Sanders' version of Medicare for All (price tag: $32 trillion).
This points to my real problem with all of this "tax the rich" talk. It works from the assumption that the problems of ordinary Americans are the result of a tiny group of people selfishly refusing to do their part. Not only does this assume that the wealth of people who have paid considerable taxes still belongs to everyone, it's also simple scapegoating. By my lights, it would be no less outrageous if the math added up. But it doesn't, which makes it even more irresponsible.

Texto completo: Corea del Norte dijo el jueves que su líder, Kim Jong-un , había supervisado la prueba de disparo de un nuevo tipo de arma guiada táctica, informa New York Times.
La Agencia Central de Noticias Central de Corea del Norte no especificó qué tipo de arma estuvo involucrada en la prueba, por lo que no está claro si fue un misil.
Corea del Norte había declarado una moratoria sobre armas nucleares y pruebas de misiles de largo alcance, después del lanzamiento de un misil balístico intercontinental en noviembre de 2017.
El presidente Trump consideró la moratoria autoimpuesta del Norte como el mayor logro de su administración en sus tratos con Corea del Norte.
Estados Unidos ha intentado negociar con Corea del Norte durante meses para poner fin a sus programas de armas nucleares y misiles cada vez más sofisticados. Pero la última reunión cumbre en febrero entre Trump y Kim terminó abruptamente sin un acuerdo.
Aunque estaba claro de inmediato qué tipo de arma se disparó, la acción marcaría la primera prueba pública de armas desde la cumbre del presidente Trump con Kim en Hanoi en febrero y una señal de desafío por parte de Kim tras un punto muerto en las conversaciones de desnuclearización de alto nivel.

Historian sues for mom’s Cold War records

Texto completo: A local historian preparing to author a book on the Cold War says the federal government is blocking her from accessing more than a thousand documents about a criminal investigation that led to her mother’s conviction as a Soviet Union spy.
Frustrated from years of receiving heavily redacted documents, and in some cases no documents at all, Emily Socolov filed a lawsuit Monday in Austin asking a federal judge to step in and order the U.S. Department of Justice to produce records she says could be critical to her book on the Red Scare in 1950s America. She is a visiting scholar at the University of Texas.
The records, according to the lawsuit, will help show how the FBI built a case that led to the 1949 arrest of Socolov’s mother, Judith Coplon, a 27-year-old political analyst for the Justice Department. The government suspected she was working in counterintelligence for the Soviets. After intercepting a secret Soviet cable in 1948 that identified Coplon by a code-name, federal agents set up a sting operation by feeding her a false memorandum about atomic power. Tracking her movements around Manhattan, the feds caught Coplon meeting with Soviet agent Valentin Gubitchen and arrested them both. Several documents, including the faked memo, were found on Coplon.
Convicted at separate trials for espionage and for conspiracy, Coplon eventually prevailed on appeal — in one
case because federal agents overheard conversations with her lawyer, and in the other because she was arrested without a warrant — and avoided a 25-year prison sentence.
According to her 2011 obituary in The New York Times, Coplon went on to marry one of her lawyers, raised four children and earned a master’s degree in education. She died at 89 as Judith Socolov, leaving behind questions about her innocence or guilt — a topic she refused to address, even with her family.
“If these were things that she actually did, she was not defending them as espionage,” Emily Socolov told the Times. “If you feel that what you’re doing answers to a higher ideal, it’s not treason.”
The Justice Department did not return a message for comment Tuesday. New York lawyer Irwin Warren, who filed the lawsuit on behalf of Socolov, did not respond to a request for additional information.
The lawsuit says Socolov wants the records for a book “that places her late mother’s tribulations in the greater context of the Cold War.” Socolov, who describes herself as a folklorist, teaches classes at UT’s Schusterman Center for Jewish Studies.
She made her first open records request in 2012, the year after her mom’s death, and then made another the following year. The FBI released 10,751 pages, but the lawsuit states 1,300 are incomprehensible because of redactions. Another six pages were withheld in their entirety, the lawsuit says.
Their basis for withholding the records include concerns over national security and a duty to protect the identities of confidential sources. But, the lawsuit says, the sources are all dead or unlikely to be alive, and the surveillance tactics used in the 1940s are now obsolete.
“But to the extent they do, those techniques are far from secret: they are well-known to anyone who has watched a Cold War spy movie (or an episode of ‘The Americans’),” the lawsuit states.

Seeing stars: Why our critic is sticking with rating system

Texto completo: In a world where everyone's a critic and a galaxy's worth of stars are doled out by users (and abusers) of Yelp, TripAdvisor and other social media platforms, why would professionals who get paid to offer opinions want to ditch star ratings? It's a question I've been asking after some prominent publications, including the Miami Herald and San Francisco Chronicle, recently announced that their restaurant reviews would no longer be accompanied by stars.
The Sun Sentinel's stars are staying. Although I sometimes agonize over the final rating I award a restaurant on our four-star scale (with three stars and above meaning it's recommended), I know readers and restaurateurs find ratings useful. Now more than ever, newspapers need to be useful to remain relevant and viable.
"The more stars I get, the more I like them," says Tim Petrillo of Fort Lauderdale-based The Restaurant People, whose establishments have been on the receiving end of glowing and tepid reviews. "But seriously, it's the measuring stick we've all gotten used to. If you didn't have stars, it's almost like, 'Everyone gets a participation trophy!' "
I understand the points raised by the Black Hole Gang (as I've taken to calling the anti-ratings crowd, because they are swallowing stars into oblivion). Their argument goes like this: A ratings system erases the nuances of a review and reduces restaurants - which are complex, evolving organisms - to a silly fixed number. And stars can overshadow the substance of a critique and blind those who pay too much attention to them, be it restaurateurs and chefs who obsess over them, writers who fret over formulating them and readers who might lazily use them without reading the full review.
But I say ditching stars is a cop-out. Critics get paid to render judgments, and a ratings system is the equivalent of a final verdict. At the very least, critics should use a "recommended/not recommended" shorthand to accompany reviews. Could you imagine Siskel and Ebert without the thumbs up/thumbs down?
"I think stars are a good concept - they quantify what you're talking about," veteran South Florida restaurateur Burt Rapoport says.
The Sun Sentinel's rating system starts at one star (poor) and runs to four stars (excellent/exceptional), awarded after I make unannounced review visits paid by my employer. Two stars is fair, 2 ½ means average/OK, 3 is good/solid, 3 ½ very good. When I award a restaurant 3 stars or higher, it means I'd return and spend my own money. There are shades of gray, which is why reading full reviews are essential. Perhaps trickiest are 2 ½ star reviews: some places have redeeming qualities and I'd return, but there are also deficiencies. (Case in point: my recent review of Bar Rita in Fort Lauderdale)
In coming up with a final rating, I consider a restaurant's food, service, wine and bar program, atmosphere/vibe/attitude and value. Food is paramount: I'd rather eat flavorful and creative cuisine served on a paper plate in a storage closet than a poorly prepared and overpriced meal on china in a dining room with white linen and crystal chandeliers. Boiling all the factors into a rating is more art than algorithm. Is it fair to rate a humble sandwich shop on the same scale as a hip and haute eatery from a star chef? I say it is, because my world is welcoming enough to embrace both as three-star worthy, even if the comparison is apples to oranges.
Ratings are based on my unannounced visits, but journalism and fairness go into the final product. Before writing reviews, I speak with owners, chefs or managers to learn about backgrounds, motivation, sourcing and techniques, and to find out about extenuating circumstances or other factors that led to problems. I'm upfront during followup interviews, because nobody likes to be sandbagged, and include their perspectives in reviews when warranted. I offer suggestions for improvement, because I want all restaurants to succeed. This is how a professional review differs from the gripers and snipers on Yelp and other social media platforms, where the motives and knowledge of the raters are opaque.
Jeremy Bearman, the chef-owner of Oceano Kitchen in Lantana, one of only seven South Florida restaurants I've awarded a top rating of four stars (excellent/exceptional) in three years, says he could do without rating stars on professional reviews.
"From my perspective I look at the experience that someone had - that's the most important thing to me," Bearman says. "I try to pick up on a couple of things that stick out the most."
Bearman, who came to South Florida in 2016 as opening chef at One Door East in Fort Lauderdale, received a positive review in the New York Times when he was executive chef at a Manhattan restaurant, Rouge Tomate, that also earned a Michelin star. As a business owner, Bearman says he must pay attention to what's being posted on social media, even if those who post may not be fair or knowledgeable: "If there are negative or recurring things - it helps you as a restaurateur to see if there's an issue."
In her essay explaining why she's ditching stars, San Francisco Chronicle dining critic Soleil Ho writes, "I don't hold myself to be an objective authority on restaurants who can accurately quantify the experience for you ... When I review restaurants, I'm talking about their context, how they exist in the world. I want to describe the images and feelings restaurateurs and chefs produce in me with the choices they make with their menus, architecture, marketing and music, to share the experiences I've had in restaurants with you in fresh and interesting ways."
On the "Let's Eat, South Florida" Facebook group administered by the Sun Sentinel, most members who chimed in on Ho's essay say they like rating stars with reviews. Wrote Doug Mosley: "I see the author's point but I think it runs counter to what we - the readers - want from a publication's dining critic. I found it strange when the author said they don't have the expertise to mete such judgment. To me, a newspaper dining critic does have that expertise, or at least that should be a reasonable expectation. Isn't that why we buy newspapers, to read the work of professionals?"
Wrote Lisa Miller: "I agree that stars are not nuanced, but a review is and stars are an indication. I'd keep them."
Reviews without ratings are not new. Many magazines that review restaurants, such as the New Yorker, do not award stars. And the late, great Jonathan Gold did not award stars in his thoughtful, erudite reviews for the Los Angeles Times.
But stars remain a tradition at many publications, including the New York Times, where only chief dining critic Pete Wells gets to award them. Some newspapers give ratings local flavor, such as the New Orleans Times-Picayune, which awards beans (as in red beans and rice) instead of stars and the Philadelphia Inquirer, which bestows Liberty Bells. I'm not quite sure what we'd use in South Florida for local flair: perhaps Key limes, stone crab claws or Botox syringes, but that could get confusing.
On Twitter this week, Miami Herald food editor Carlos Frias defended the scrapping of the newspaper's longstanding four-star rating system: "I want our reviewer to gush about a place or knock it and not have to worry how his rating would square with a past review. It can feel arbitrary, like football power rankings. (Sorry, former sports writer here.) And, to me, it distracts from the journalism."
Sorry, but I think it bolsters it.

Councilwoman: Notre Dame Cathedral fire reaction 'prime example of privilege'

Texto completo: Cincinnati Councilwoman Tamaya Dennard on Twitter said she's sad the Notre Dame Cathedral has been damaged by fire, but the reaction has been a "prime example of privilege."
She pointed to the recent string of arsons at predominantly black churches in Louisiana as an example.
"I'm sure they held significance as well," she wrote in the Tuesday morning Tweet. "They were barely acknowledged."
Dennard declined further comment.
The burning of Notre Dame dominated cable news channels Monday. Social media feeds all over the world and in Cincinnati were filled with posts by people who had visited the cathedral. And the City of Cincinnati, as requested by Councilman Chris Seelbach, lit up the city's convention sign in red, blue and white, a nod to France's flag.
The Louisiana church burnings too have garnered national attention, with front page coverage in the New York Times and other national media outlets. But they didn't get the continuous live coverage or social media attention given to the Notre Dame fire.
Joe Mallory, vice president of the Cincinnati chapter of the NAACP, said he too sees the disparity Dennard pointed out.
"This is not the first time this has happened with black churches, where people set fires to them," Mallory said. "There is not an outcry. It's sad, but it's the reality of this country what people value."
Mallory said it was as true of local icons as with international ones like Notre Dame.
"Look at Music Hall or Union Terminal, the landmarks people value," Mallory said. "They will leave no stone unturned to improve them and make it better. If something happened to Music Hall, I guarantee they would rebuild it. Clearly, there is not a lot of value placed on black life; there's no investment in trying to uplift the black community."
Dennard took office in January, one of nine City Council members. She has made a name for herself calling out what she sees as white privilege when it comes to financing development projects and changes coming to the city's West End, where the Major League Soccer stadium is being built.
She championed the recent passage of a ban on asking salary history as a way to reduce pay disparities between women and men with similar jobs. Last year she proposed studying whether city policies were racist, though the idea never came to a vote.
Hamilton County Republican Party Chairman Alex Triantafilou responded to the tweets with a critical Facebook post.
"City voters made a mistake electing this person to lead our fine city," Triantafilou said of Dennard. "It is a mistake I only hope they reverse in 2021. This is an embarrassment."
Notre Dame's altar is surrounded by charred debris.

Bernie still gets to run against Clinton, Inc

Texto completo: Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., is both a millionaire and a socialist, a presidential hopeful who swears he'll make the rich pay their "fair share" but who couldn't avoid getting kicked off of a commune for laziness. He wants to nationalize one-fifth of the economy, abolish private health insurance, and enact a "Medicare For all" bill that fewer than four in ten Americans support. He's a radical who honeymooned in the Soviet Union, and he's built an entire career on the taxpayer dime without ever creating a single job.

All that, and he's not even close to being the least likable figure in the Democratic Party.

The wounds of 2016 still run deep, and just like President Trump, Sanders still has the privilege of running against the Clinton machine and their corrupt cronies. The New York Times is out with a spectacle of a story detailing the divide between the Sanders camp and Clinton surrogates at the Center for American Progress. It inadvertently makes the strongest case for Sanders that he could possibly make during the coming primary: he's running as much against his own party's establishment as he is against the opposition party.

Tanden corrected the Times' witness account by asserting, "I didn’t slug him, I pushed him." Nice.

Given that the Times literally interviewed Tanden's mother for the piece, but not Shakir, who now runs Sanders' presidential campaign, it's clear that the paper is sympathetic to the Clinton camp. Tanden is permitted multiple defenses for her insufferable bullying of Sanders followers, the media, and pretty much anyone she feels like lashing out at on Twitter in a given day. For example:

But whatever the intention, the Times just handed Sanders a gift — a 1,000 word reminder that even if you hate his ideas, he fought a corrupt Democratic establishment in earnest. That's got to be worth something.

Although Bernie's building a ruthless official war machine, the myth of the "Bernie Bros" couldn't be more malicious and false. As annoyingly pedantic as die-hard Sanders supports may be online, they engage in half the amount of harassment and conspiracy mongering that the worst Clinton cronies do. Hillary needed the "Bernie Bro" narrative to survive the 2016 primary and brush over her own horrific record on justice for women, but this time around, it seems unlikely to stick.

And Democrats are scared. Just like Republicans were of Trump.

Trump ran on the promise that he wouldn't touch entitlements, and in promising tax cuts alongside massive spending projects, effectively swore to spike the deficit. This is not a conservative stance, but at least it's the honest one. It's exactly what the Republican Party spent the last decade doing — Trump just had the gall to say the quiet part out loud. Voters were tired of being lied to and ignored by the Republican Party, so they turned to Trump. It's hard to see how Bernie couldn't rally the same reactionary support if he survives the dangerous terrain of early primary states.

Hillary Clinton may have been the only candidate in America who could possibly lose the presidency to a non-incumbent Donald Trump. She was certainly the worst candidate in modern American politics, and she'd be wise to sit this election out, lest she wants to hand it to her foes. And if the continued groveling by her cronies is any indication, the Clinton legacy itself may continue to provide fodder against the Democratic establishment.

Los polémicos testimonios secretos del juicio a “El Chapo”

Texto completo: Aunque durante el juicio a Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán Loera se dieron a conocer cientos de documentos de testimonios de testigos y cooperantes, fiscales federales y defensores del mexicano decidieron sellar miles más, debido a que contienen información que podría ser perjudicial para el caso, a favor o en contra.
En octubre de 2018, a pocas semanas de que iniciara el proceso en la Corte Federal de Brooklyn, los fiscales del Distrito Este de Nueva York y el equipo legal de Guzmán Loera acordaron revelar versiones públicas de esos testimonios, a petición de los abogados del New York Times y de VICE News.
Uno de los primeros documentos que se reveló integra las declaraciones de Alex Cifuentes , exsocio de Guzmán Loera, sobre la contratación de menores de hasta 13 años por las que, supuestamente, el líder del Cártel de Sinaloa pagaba para drogarlas y tener sexo con ellas.
Semanas después se dio a conocer otra parte de esos documentos, donde los fiscales federales y la defensa indicaron que algunos dichos de ese cooperante podrían afectar el proceso –de uno y otro lado– en caso de que se dieran a conocer. Aquellos documentos incluyen las creencias esotéricas de Cifuentes y más detalles de sus gustos sexuales.
Los documentos debieron ser publicados entre enero 22 y marzo 20, pero no ha ocurrido así, por lo que fiscales federales y defensores de Guzmán Loera pidieron al juez Brian Cogan una extensión, la cual fue concedida hasta el 3 de mayo.
“La extensión permitirá a las partes dedicar recrusos apropiados y exclusivamente a los esfuerzos de revisar los archivos previamente sellados” , indica una carta enviada al juez Cogan, quien aceptó la moción.
Se espera que los documentos contengan información sobre el comportamiento privado y público de Guzmán Loera y sus socios, datos que no fueron utilizados en el juicio.
Another deadline to unseal documents from the El Chapo trial passed this weekend with nothing released to the public.
Today, the government and defense filed a joint motion asking for a "modest extension" until May 3, which Judge Cogan has granted.https://t.co/65JPCnU7Uj pic.twitter.com/aSNNwzPYE5

Global measles count up 300 percent in first quarter

Texto completo: World
GENEVA - Global measles cases are rising for the third year in a row, the World Health Organization said Monday in Geneva, reporting that recorded cases between January and March were 300 percent higher than in the same period last year.
In the first quarter of the year, 170 countries reported some 112,000 infections, up from 28,000 in the first quarter of 2018. However, actual numbers are likely to be 10 times as high, as only a fraction of cases are reported, according to the U.N. health agency.
Although the disease could be prevented if 95 percent of the population were immunized, the WHO reported that global coverage for the first dose of the two-step vaccination has stalled at 85 percent for several years.
Global coverage for the second dose is only 67 percent.
Nearly a quarter of measles patients are hospitalized with complications that can lead to disabilities, brain damage, blindness and hearing loss.
Measles killed nearly 110,000 people in 2017, according to the latest available fatality numbers.
Ecuador says Assange used embassy for spying
The president of Ecuador has accused Julian Assange of using its embassy in London as a "center for spying."
In an interview with the Guardian, Lenmn Moreno expressed frustration with the WikiLeaks founder, who had been provided asylum by Ecuador since 2012. On Thursday, the country revoked that asylum, leading to Assange's arrest by British police on a U.S. hacking charge.
"We cannot allow our house, the house that opened its doors, to become a center for spying," Moreno told the Guardian. "This activity violates asylum conditions. Our decision is not arbitrary but is based on international law."
The allegations appear to stem in part from a batch of leaked personal photos of Moreno and his family that appeared last month on an anonymous website, while the president was in the midst of a political battle at home. Moreno blamed WikiLeaks for the release of the photos, the New York Times reported.
Moreno also cited WikiLeaks' dump of a tranche of Vatican documents in January.

Texto completo: Two works by Anna Deavere Smith will be revived by Signature Theater in its 2019-2020 Season, the company announced on Thursday.
While Ms. Smith will not direct or feature in either show, she will play an active role in the plays' production, a spokesman for Signature Theater said.
Ms. Smith is one of the resident playwrights whose works will be featured in the new season, with "Fires in the Mirror" and "Twilight: Los Angeles, 1992." "Fires" is a one-person play exploring the views of both African-Americans and Ultra Orthodox Jews during the Crown Heights riots of August 1991 which Saheem Ali will direct. "Twilight" is a dissection of the 1992 Los Angeles riots after a Rodney King trial that Taibi Magar will direct. The play was named in The New York Times's list of the 25 best American plays since "Angels in America." "Twilight" has been performed without her before.
[Read an essay by Anna Deavere Smith here.]
The season, which will open on Oct. 22 and run through June 14, 2020, will also include the world premiere of "Confederates," written by the MacArthur 'genius' fellow Dominique Morisseau. A juxtaposition of the identities of two black American women, the play jumps through time in an analysis of the endurance of racial and gender bias in the American education system across generations. Kamilah Forbes will direct.
[Check out our Culture Calendar here.]
And Katori Hall's "The Hot Wing King" will have its world premiere, with Steve H. Broadnax III as director. This play is set amid a cooking contest in Memphis in which one contestant is risking a lot.
Also in the season are "A Young Man from Atlanta," a revival of the play by Horton Foote, with Michael Wilson directing; and the New York premiere of "Cambodian Rock Band" by Lauren Yee, with Chay Yew directing.
All performances will take place at the Pershing Square Signature Center in New York. For more information, visit signaturetheatre.org.

Texto completo: Last week’s arrest of Wikileaks publisher Julian Assange by the British government on a U.S. extradition order is an attack on all of us. It is an attack on the U.S. Constitution. It is an attack on the free press. It is an attack on free speech. It is an attack on our right to know what our government is doing with our money in our name.
Julian Assange is every bit as much a political prisoner as was Cardinal Mindszenty in Hungary or Nelson Mandela in South Africa.
They, and so many more, were imprisoned because they told the truth about their governments.
Repressive governments do not want their citizens to know that they are up to so they insist on controlling the media. We are taught, at the same time, that we have a free press whose job it is to uncover the corruption in our system so that we can demand our political leaders make some changes or face unemployment. That, we are told, is what makes us different from the totalitarian.
The arrest of Assange is a canary in a coal mine to warn us that something is very wrong with our system.
What’s wrong? The U.S. mainstream media always seems to do the bidding of the U.S. government. That is why they rushed to confirm Washington’s claim that the Assange indictment was not in any way about journalism. It was only about hacking government computers!
As the New York Times said in an editorial, sounding like a mouthpiece of the U.S. government, Julian Assange committed “an indisputable crime.” But was it? As actual journalist Glenn Greenwald wrote last week, what Julian Assange did in 2010, for which he is facing extradition to the U.S., is no different from what New York Times and other journalists do every day! He attempted to help Chelsea Manning shield Manning’s identity as Manning blew the whistle on U.S. government crimes to a publisher. The information in question included a video showing U.S. military personnel participating in and cheering the murder of Iraqi civilians. Why is it criminal for us to know this?
The difference is that what Assange and Manning did embarrassed the U.S. government, which was lying to us that it was “liberating” Iraq and Afghanistan when it was actually doing the opposite. Mainstream journalists publish “leaks” that help bolster the neocon or other vested narratives of the different factions of the US government. That’s why the US media wants to see Assange in prison, or worse: he upset their apple cart.
The lesson is clear: when you bolster the government’s narrative you are a “brave journalist.” When you expose corruption in government you are a criminal. Do we really want to live in a country where it is illegal to learn that our government is engaged in criminal acts? I thought we had an obligation as an engaged citizenry to hold our government accountable!
As long as Julian Assange is in prison, we are all in prison. When the government has the power to tell us what we are allowed to see, hear, and know, we no longer live in a free society. Julian Assange will be extradited to the U.S. and he will have dozens of charges piled on. They want him to disappear so that the next Assange will think twice before informing us of our government’s crimes. Are we going to let them steal our freedom?

Texto completo: A year ago, shock waves rippled through the arts world when the Pulitzer Prize in Music, almost always bestowed on a classical composer, was awarded to Kendrick Lamar's album "DAMN."
"This is a big moment for hip-hop music and a big moment for the Pulitzers," Dana Canedy, the prizes' administrator, said then.
"I never thought I'd be a part of it," Mr. Lamar told Vanity Fair about the prize. "It's one of those things that should have happened with hip-hop a long time ago."
It was not only the first time the prize had gone to a hip-hop work; never before had it been given to any kind of mainstream popular music. Even as Pulitzer-winning musical styles shifted over the decades, from the Americana of Copland's "Appalachian Spring" (1945) to the fragmented atonality of Donald Martino's "Notturno" (1974) to the joyful genre-bending of Caroline Shaw's "Partita" (2013), the prize has remained almost exclusively the province of classical music.
But Mr. Lamar's Pulitzer upended all that. Was "DAMN." a fluke, or will the prize -- the 2019 winner will be announced on April 15 -- genuinely embrace popular music? What now counts as a "distinguished American composition"?
The music Pulitzer was established in 1943 as a celebration of homegrown art in the midst of World War II; the first winner was a briskly patriotic cantata by the Neo-Classicist William Schuman. For decades, the prize was mostly given to well-established composers: As Mr. Martino once said, "If you write music long enough, sooner or later someone is going to take pity on you and give you the damn thing."
There was also long a sense that awardees largely came out of the insular academic scene. In a scathing 1991 article, the critic Kyle Gann chastised the Pulitzer as a "reward for conformity and a compensation prize for ineffectuality." After winning, in 2003, John Adams told The New York Times that, "among musicians that I know, the Pulitzer has over the years lost much of the prestige it still carries in other fields like literature and journalism." (Mr. Adams, as well as six other Pulitzer-winning composers, declined to be interviewed for this article; Mr. Lamar was unavailable for comment.)
Recently the prize has broadened in aesthetic scope and given a career boost to young composers like Ms. Shaw, who was 30 when she won. But until Mr. Lamar, it had still barely budged outside of its old classical music limits. When, in 1965, the music jury attempted to break free of those constraints by requesting a special citation for Duke Ellington, the Pulitzer's governing board declined the recommendation.
The prize has been haunted by that embarrassing episode, only partly rectified by special awards and citations granted posthumously to Ellington and other jazz legends like Scott Joplin and John Coltrane. A turning point came in 1997, when Wynton Marsalis won, the first time the prize recognized jazz. The guidelines subsequently eliminated an original reference to classical forms and, in 2004, dropped a requirement to provide a notated score, allowing for recording-only submissions.
There were critics. "I don't think it's a good idea at all," Mr. Martino said of the new openness in 2004. "Let these people win DownBeat polls," referring to the jazz magazine. (Characteristic of the history of the prize is the contradiction that some of the composers who have complained about its insularity have also vociferously defended its boundaries.)
Such changes, though, didn't overturn the status quo. Since Mr. Marsalis, only two other jazz composers have won: Ornette Coleman and Henry Threadgill. Even Mr. Lamar's path to victory last year was somewhat unusual: "DAMN." had not been officially submitted. But during a weekend of deliberations, the five-member music jury weighed the merits of some classical submissions that drew on hip-hop influences, and came to the conclusion that hip-hop itself should be under consideration.
The jury introduced "DAMN." into the process and ultimately decided it was worthy of the prize. "We're there all day listening, reading, discussing," one of the 2018 jurors, the jazz violinist Regina Carter, said in a recent interview. "We were all really respectful of one another and listened to each other. There was no fighting going on: We'd argue our cases, but it never got ugly."
Ms. Canedy, who spent much of her career as a reporter and editor at The New York Times, became the Pulitzers' administrator in 2017. She sees Mr. Lamar's win as a step toward diversifying the submission pool. "The biggest thing we could have done to send a signal to the music industry that we're serious about this is to award a Pulitzer to Kendrick Lamar," she said in a recent interview. "That's not why we did it; we did it because his work was spectacular. But if it sends a signal to the industry that we really are open to all kinds of amazing music, then that's a good thing."
But even if SoundCloud rappers and aspiring singer-songwriters start to submit, their work still needs to be evaluated by a jury. Pulitzer juries in the past decade have typically comprised a mix of classical and jazz musicians, critics, academics and arts administrators. Will future juries give adequate attention to nonclassical submissions -- or have the knowledge to properly distinguish a work of the caliber of "DAMN." from other hip-hop entries?
"Technically speaking, excellent music is excellent music," Ms. Canedy said. "So I think if you can judge excellent music, you can do that across genres."
Maybe, or maybe not. Having listened to Mr. Lamar's music, Steve Reich, who won in 2009, said, "I don't know enough hip-hop to separate him from other hip-hop artists."
"To make a judgment, you have to make an informed judgment," Mr. Reich added. "And I don't have that. Therefore, I wouldn't be competent to judge him."
The composer Kevin Puts, who won in 2012, said in a recent interview, "I do a lot of judging of competitions for so-called classical music, like orchestra music. I feel I'm qualified to do that. But I wonder, if there were more genres or more styles involved, if I would really be the person to make a good decision."
Ms. Carter expressed confidence in the diversity of the two juries on which she has served. But she also acknowledged that there were potential limitations in the early stages. "If you have jurors and no one is familiar with that genre, then I think it's not even going to make it into that forward pile," she said. Excellent music may be excellent music, but not all musicians have equal understanding or even respect for different traditions; consider the many online commenters who dismissed Mr. Lamar's win, one of whom described the album as "neurologically divergent from music."
The prize, moreover, is not actually decided by the music jurors. The jury is instructed to provide the Pulitzers' administrative board -- which includes journalists, editors and academics, but not professional musicians -- with three unranked nominations. The board then decides which of the three receives the award.
"We would have been happy with whomever they had chosen to win both times," Ms. Carter said of her juries, "because all of the composers felt really strong and their works were really intriguing." Last year's Pulitzer could well have gone to one of the other, more conventional finalists, the composers Ted Hearne and Michael Gilbertson, rather than Mr. Lamar.
And if a future board were to be confronted with, say, an opera by Tania León, an experimental record by Nicole Mitchell, and a visual album by Beyoncé, might its members tend to select the finalist with whom they were already most familiar?
"That's just never happened," Ms. Canedy said. "Every finalist gets its due when it comes before the board," she added. "They do what they do, which is download the work, listen to it, debate it, and then make a decision."
It's not always that simple. The Ellington controversy arose from disagreement between a jury eager to award a jazz master and a board concerned that it was violating the prize's rules. In 1992, the music jury recommended only a single finalist: a work by the composer Ralph Shapey. The board demanded that the jury provide a second option and, when a piece by the composer Wayne Peterson was submitted, the board chose the Peterson.
Angry jurors then released a statement describing the board's decision as "especially alarming because it occurred without consultation and without knowledge of either our standards or rationale. Such alterations by a committee without professional musical expertise guarantees, if continued, a lamentable devaluation of this uniquely important award."
And the Pulitzer remains singularly important -- which makes its intricate rules and shifts of stylistic emphasis big news in the music world. The 2019 prize may go to a groundbreaking symphony, a confessional folk record or a transcendent mixtape. Speaking in late February, Ms. Canedy said that the music jury -- which will remain anonymous until the prize is announced -- had selected its three finalists.
"We had a diverse slate of entries," she said. "We have three finalists that we're incredibly proud of, and would be happy to see any of the three win a Pulitzer."

Texto completo: ON THE VENEZUELA-COLOMBIA BORDER - She is 15 years old, pregnant, hungry and alone. Deisimar sat on a bench in a park in Maicao, just inside Colombia, and wept as she told her story - the story of Venezuela.
Deisimar was born in an oil-rich, middle-class Venezuela. Then everything began to collapse at a pace reminiscent of Weimar Germany or Syria during the civil war.
In the oil hub of Maracaibo, Deisimar's family lost electricity, reliable running water, health care and, finally, food. Venezuela's inflation may reach 10 million percent this year, the International Monetary Fund says, and some people root through garbage or eat rats to survive.
"We had no money to buy food, so I came here," Deisimar explained. Complicating the situation, she had become pregnant by her equally impoverished 18-year-old boyfriend. Contraception has become unavailable or unaffordable: A single condom now costs as much as a couple of pounds of rice and more than a tank of gas.
"I don't have enough to eat, so how could I pay for birth control?" Deisimar asked me.
She walks about selling medicines from 6 a.m. to 8 p.m. each day. She eats at a soup kitchen when she can, but there are long lines because there are so many desperate Venezuelans here, with hundreds sleeping in the park each night.
Deisimar hasn't been to a clinic for any prenatal care, and she doesn't know what will happen to her. "Nobody in my family knows I'm pregnant," she said.
After traveling along the border with Mercy Corps, an aid group helping Venezuelans in this border region, I ache with stories from so many people like Deisimar. More than 3.4 million Venezuelans have fled their country so far, according to the United Nations, and millions more are expected to follow this year.
American liberals sometimes sympathize with the Venezuelan president, Nicolás Maduro, out of instinctive resistance to President Donald Trump. Don't. Maduro has been a catastrophe for Venezuelans, and Trump is right to join Canada and more than 50 other countries in recognizing the head of the National Assembly, Juan Guaidó, as the legitimate leader of Venezuela.
The problem is that Trump's saber-rattling backfires, helping Maduro by playing into a narrative of Yankee imperialism, and his politicization of humanitarian aid makes it less likely that starving people will actually be fed.
Here's a three-part strategy that some other countries are already moving toward: Nudge Mexico (which has refused to back Guaidó) to play a more constructive role; work with Canada, Peru and Colombia to coax and coerce Venezuela's generals away from Maduro; and offer Maduro a comfortable retirement abroad if he steps down, versus a prison cell if he remains.
Venezuelans overwhelmingly told me that they want tougher international action to dislodge Maduro. "I lost my jobs because of sanctions," said Claritza Rojas, who used to work for PDVSA, the state oil company, and now is homeless in Maicao. "They affect us, but pressure on Maduro is still good."
Conditions may get worse, for the economy and health system are virtually in free fall. A university survey found that two-thirds of Venezuelans had lost weight - an average of 25 pounds in a single year.
"Sometimes we went two or three days without eating anything," a mother, Anyi Coromoto, 25, told me, a day after arriving from Maracaibo with her son, Dylan. Dylan, 1 year old, weighs 11 pounds and was immediately hospitalized to save his life.
In a world that has mostly treated migrants wretchedly, Colombia is playing a heroic role in providing such care. The country has admitted perhaps 2 million Venezuelans - often allowing them to work, attend school and receive free health care. And ordinary Colombians routinely give food to hungry Venezuelans on the street; the world has much to learn from warmhearted Colombians.

Texto completo: Julian Assange is no hero. Neither is he a journalist. And, even if he were, he is not under indictment for what he published, but for complicity in illegally hacking and obtaining information from private servers.
I know many of my friends despise the Democratic National Committee and are happy its mail servers were attacked and the information pertaining to the Hillary Clinton campaign was dumped, but that was done only because she was the nominee. Had it been Bernie or anyone else, the same thing would have happened to them.
I know many of my friends also despise the U.S. military and intelligence services and were happy those servers were hacked and that information released. But, regardless of the light shone on atrocities committed by our military, and even more so by private contractors such as Blackwater during our generation-long wars, the lives of many innocent people were endangered by their outing. We will never know how many actually lost their lives because of him.
If the information regarding military war crimes was made available to Assange, it instead could have been made available to The New York Times or The Washington Post or to any other reputable news outlet, which would have been responsible enough to redact information that put the lives of innocent people at risk, and Chelsea Manning would have become the Daniel Ellsberg of the current generation.
But more contemptible than that, Assange is guilty of outing many in the LGBTQ community around the world, in places where being outed carries the death penalty. Many of those he exposed have been beaten, raped, tortured and executed because of him. Again, we will never know the full extent of the harm he has caused to those in that community, but those we do know of are enough to earn him a legacy of shame and the rest of his life in prison.
Despite his claim to be the voice of truth and openness, it is not his right to expose the sexual orientation of private citizens around the world, thereby exposing them to the horrors of extremist religious and autocratic regimes. Nor is it his right to expose covert intelligence employees, some in no more notable roles than clerical or research staff, subjecting them to murder by hostile foreign governments.
It's interesting that the only political campaign Assange injected himself into was the 2016 presidential election, and the only information he chose to release was that which was damaging to Democrats and helpful to Republicans. It is well known that he also had access to mountains of information stolen from Republicans but, for some reason, he chose to not release any of that.
Also interesting is that Donald Trump heaped praises on Assange and Wikileaks literally hundreds of times during the last month alone of his campaign, and he actually had a poster of Assange in the prep room before rallies and debates, but, all of a sudden, he now knows nothing about Wikileaks, and wants us to believe he's not even sure who Assange is.
Assange is no hero. Any defense of him solely because he exposed war crimes in Iraq neglects the whole of the picture and ignores the irreparable damage he's done to the lives of countless innocent individuals.

Texto completo: S. Korean court orders easing of decades-old abortion ban
SEOUL, South Korea - In a major reversal, South Korea's Constitutional Court on Thursday ordered the easing of the country's decades-old ban on most abortions, one of the strictest in the developed world.
Abortions have been largely illegal in South Korea since 1953, though convictions for violating the restrictions are rare. Still, the illegality of abortions forces women to seek out unauthorized and often expensive procedures to end their pregnancies, creating a social stigma that makes them feel like criminals.
The court's nine-justice panel said that the parliament must revise legislation to ease the current regulations by the end of 2020. It said the current abortion law was incompatible with the constitution and would be repealed if parliament fails to come up with new legislation by then.
The ruling is final and cannot be appealed, court officials said, but current regulations will remain in effect until they are replaced or repealed.
Current exceptions to the law only allow abortions when a woman is pregnant through rape or incest, when a pregnancy seriously jeopardizes her health, or when she or her male partner has certain diseases.
A woman in South Korea can be punished with up to one year in prison for having an illegal abortion, and a doctor can get up to two years in prison for performing an unauthorized abortion.
Thursday's verdict was a response to an appeal filed in 2017 by an obstetrician charged with carrying out about 70 unauthorized abortions from 2013-2017 at the request or approval of pregnant women.

4 in Senate GOP signal their opposition to Cain on Fed
WASHINGTON - A swift defection of at least four Senate Republicans has all-but-doomed the chance of Herman Cain to win a seat on the Federal Reserve's board of governors, serving as one of the most striking rebukes to President Donald Trump's personnel choices since he took office in 2017.
Sens. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, Cory Gardner, R-Colo., and Sen. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., all said they would oppose Cain's appointment to the Fed. Republicans control 53 seats of the 100-chamber Senate, and losing the support of four members means Cain would need help from Democrats, which appears unlikely.
Cain ran for president in the 2012 GOP primary, but lost momentum amid accusations of sexual harassment and misconduct, among other things.

Cain has denied wrongdoing.
Navy drops criminal charges against ex-Fitzgerald officers
Two former officers involved in the June 2017 collision between the USS Fitzgerald and a commercial ship off the coast of Japan will no longer face criminal charges, the Navy has announced.
"This decision is in the best interest of the Navy, the families of the Fitzgerald Sailors, and the procedural rights of the accused officers," the Navy said in a news release late Wednesday. "Both officers were previously dismissed from their jobs and received nonjudicial punishment."
Former commanding officer Cmdr. Bryce Benson was sleeping in his quarters the night of the collision, while former crew member Lt. Natalie Combs was manning the ship's Combat Information Center.
Two other officers were also charged in the collision, which killed seven U.S. sailors.

Trump's sister retires, negating judicial ethics complaints
NEW YORK - President Donald Trump's sister has retired as a federal appellate judge in Philadelphia, ending a civil misconduct inquiry launched after a report that she participated in Trump family schemes to dodge taxes.
The retirement of Maryanne Trump Barry was revealed in an April 1 order signed by a top court official in New York, where the misconduct case was assigned to prevent conflicts of interest for judges who knew Barry.
A judicial panel began the review in response to four citizen complaints filed in October after The New York Times published a story alleging the president and his siblings evaded inheritance taxes.
Barry, 82, was not identified by name in the order, but the facts matched her circumstances.

Ohio governor signs fetal heartbeat abortion bill
COLUMBUS, Ohio - Ohio's governor has signed a bill imposing one of the nation's toughest abortion restrictions.
Republican Gov. Mike DeWine followed through Thursday on his pledge to sign the heartbeat bill. It cleared the state Legislature on Wednesday.
It makes Ohio the fifth state to ban abortions after the first detectable fetal heartbeat. That can come as early as five or six weeks into pregnancy, before many women know they're pregnant.
DeWine's support for the bill breaks with his predecessor. Former Republican Gov. John Kasich twice vetoed it on grounds it was unconstitutional and would spark a costly court challenge.
Even before the bill was signed, the ACLU of Ohio said it was preparing a constitutional challenge on behalf of four Ohio abortion clinics.

Senate confirms ex-lobbyist to lead Interior
WASHINGTON - The Senate on Thursday confirmed acting Interior Secretary David Bernhardt to lead the department on a permanent basis, despite complaints by Democrats that the former oil and gas lobbyist has used his federal position to benefit former industry clients.
Senators voted 56-41 to approve Bernhardt's nomination to oversee more than 500 million acres of public lands and other resources, including national parks, monuments and wildlife refuges. He succeeds Ryan Zinke, who resigned in January amid a series of ethics investigations.
Bernhardt was confirmed to the No. 2 position in July 2017.
Three Democrats - Sens. Martin Heinrich, N.M., Joe Manchin, W.Va., and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona - voted for Bernhardt.

WASHINGTON -- The Senate on Thursday voted to confirm David Bernhardt, a former lobbyist for the oil and agribusiness industries, as secretary of the interior. The confirmation of Mr. Bernhardt to his new post coincided with calls from more than a dozen Democrats and government watchdogs for formal investigations into his past conduct.
Senators voted 56-41, largely along party lines, in favor of Mr. Bernhardt's confirmation. Three Democrats -- Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia, the senior Democrat on the Senate Energy Committee; Senator Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona; and Senator Martin Heinrich of New Mexico -- supported Mr. Bernhardt, as did one independent, Senator Angus King of Maine.
As interior secretary, Mr. Bernhardt, who has already played a central role in designing many of Mr. Trump's policies for expanding drilling and mining, will now serve as the nation's senior steward of its 500 million acres of public land and vast coastal waters.
Mr. Bernhardt was the deputy to Mr. Trump's first interior secretary, Ryan Zinke, who resigned this year amid allegations of ethical misconduct.
At least eight senators, all Democrats, and four government ethics watchdog groups have requested that the Interior Department's inspector general open formal investigations into various aspects of Mr. Bernhardt's conduct. Separately, at least one Democratic senator and one government watchdog group have requested that the United States attorney's office investigate whether Mr. Bernhardt may have committed civil or criminal violations before he joined the Trump administration.
Mr. Bernhardt has testified to Congress that he has made an effort to be ethical in all his work. "I believe public trust is a public responsibility, and maintaining ethical culture is critical," he said at his Senate confirmation hearing last month.
He also said that he has sought to strengthen the culture of ethics at the Interior Department, which became notorious for corruption scandals during the George W. Bush administration, when the deputy secretary of the interior, J. Steven Griles, was sentenced to prison for lying to a Senate committee about his ties to the lobbyist Jack Abramoff. At that time, Mr. Bernhardt was the Interior Department's solicitor.
"I know how important and how devastating it is when folks at the top act in an unethical manner," he said.
The questions about Mr. Bernhardt's conduct do not appear to have swayed Republican support for Mr. Trump's nominee. Republican leaders have praised Mr. Bernhardt's experience in the Bush administration.
"Mr. Bernhardt has significant private practice experience as well as a past record of service at the Department," said Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, in a statement. "Along the way, he's earned the respect of those who rely on the public lands the Department of the Interior is charged to oversee, from Native American leaders to sportsmen's groups. He's been praised as a 'proven leader' who 'acts with integrity' and has 'the right approach and skill set."'
Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said: "It still amazes me. Donald Trump campaigns on cleaning up the swamp and he does exactly the opposite when in office. An oil and gas lobbyist as head of the Department of Interior? My God. That's an example of the swampiness of Washington if there ever was one. And when are Donald Trump's supporters going to understand this?"
Environmental groups who opposed Mr. Bernhardt's confirmation were not surprised that Senator Manchinn -- whose state, West Virigina, is rich in coal and who often votes with Republicans on energy and environmental policy matters -- supported Mr. Bernhardt. But many environmentalists expressed anger that Senator Heinrich, who has presented himself as an environmental champion, particularly on issues of climate change, backed the confirmation of a former oil lobbyist to oversee public lands.
This week, the Western Values Project, a conservation advocacy organization, ran a television ad campaign in New Mexico urging Senator Heinrich to vote against Mr. Bernhardt.
Senator Heinrich said that, as a lawmaker from a state where roughly one-third of the land is owned and operated by the Interior Department, it was important to him to have a permanent, confirmed secretary at the head of the agency, even if the person in that role was not his first choice.
"I need to be able to pick up the phone and talk to the secretary of interior on a regular basis. I'm not going to be able to get the interior secretary I wanted. We didn't win in 2016," he said, referring to the presidential race. "But in New Mexico, I'm going to put my state and protection of public lands in my state first."
The National Ocean Industries Association, a lobbying organization for offshore drilling companies, including many of Mr. Bernhardt's former clients, cheered his confirmation. "His unparalleled depth of experience at the department and knowledge of energy and conservation policies will serve our nation's public lands and resources well," said the group's president, Randall Luthi.
Offhore oil companies have been working closely with Mr. Bernhardt over the past several months as he develops the administration's plan to open up most United States coastal waters to offshore drilling. A draft of that plan was made public last year, and Mr. Bernhardt is expected to put forth a final plan later this year.
Government watchdog groups criticized the ties between Mr. Bernhardt and his former clients. "We know with absolute certainty that Bernhardt will be a horrible secretary, because he had been a catastrophic deputy secretary -- eager to do the bidding of his former clients, without regard to the impact on the public lands, endangered species or public health," said Robert Weissman, president of Public Citizen, which has filed a complaint against Mr. Bernhardt with the Interior Department's ethics office.
In addition, ethics specialists and Democratic lawmakers have requested that the Interior Department's inspector general explore the findings of a New York Times investigation in February that revealed that Mr. Bernhardt, while in office, had personally directed a policy to weaken endangered species protections on a California fish, a change that could directly benefit one of his former lobbying clients, the Westlands Water District.
They have also sought an investigation based on a separate Times report detailing previously undisclosed emails indicating that, in the months before he was nominated to office, Mr. Bernhardt continued to lobby for the Westlands Water District even after he filed official papers saying that he had ended his lobbying activities. Federal law requires lobbyists to disclose their activities.
Lawmakers have also sought a formal inquiry into the findings of a report in the Times in March showing that Mr. Bernhardt had intervened to block the release of a scientific report revealing the threat presented by three widely used pesticides to hundreds of endangered species, including the kit fox and the seaside sparrow.
The inspector general's office has not confirmed that any investigations of Mr. Bernhardt are underway.

Bret Easton Ellis turns to nonfiction to talk Trump, Kanye West, ‘American Psycho’ and our whiny culture in ‘White’

Texto completo: By the fall of 1990, Bret Easton Ellis had enjoyed the success of his debut novel “Less Than Zero,” seen it adapted by Hollywood, and published a second novel all before he’d turned 27.
And then “American Psycho” happened.
Or more accurately, at first it didn’t happen: Just weeks before publication, Simon & Schuster canceled the book amid outcry over the violence in the black satire about a yuppie Wall Street serial killer.
And then it was back on. Knopf plucked “American Psycho” off its rival publisher’s scrapheap and published it 1991 to widespread publicity that zigzagged between acclaim and scorn.
While Ellis found success with the book, and the movie adaptation that followed years later, in that moment of controversy something changed. These events would influence his perspective on the world, on the role of the independently minded individual and on the ability to be truly free. All this flows across the pages of “White,” his first-ever book of non-fiction, and first book at all in nine years.
“That for me was a wake-up call,” Ellis says recently from his home in West Hollywood just over the hills from the San Fernando Valley of his childhood and adolescence. “That a corporation was making decisions about what creatively a subsidiary could do creatively. What a publishing house was allowed to publish and was not allowed to publish.”
It was, Ellis says, his close-up look at a mob mentality, a hysteria over fiction that nearly no one, including all of the individuals and organizations arguing against “American Psycho,” had read.
“Like the cancellation was going to save something in America,” he says. “It was a moment. My friends were right. Jay McInerney (author of “Bright Lights, Big City,” which made a similar splash to that of “Less Than Zero”) said recently in the New York Times that he believes that’s where my freedom of expression and hating censorship and self-censorship really began.”
In “White,” which is crafted as a series of loosely themed essays, many of them adaptations of pieces originally written as monologues for “The Bret Easton Ellis Podcast,” Ellis shows readers where that mindset – fiercely independent, sometimes controversial, and always outspoken – has led him today.
“It came together very quickly in terms of the mood I was in at this moment,” he says. “And the changes I was feeling as a member of a generation who really, you know, was mostly noted for not really be able to take offense at anything, and finding myself forced into a way of thinking that I never that I would before.
“I never thought I would have been labeled or considered, as my democratic socialist boyfriend calls me, very much in the center, rather than what I always thought was a progressive gay guy.”
So what offends the 55-year-old Gen X-er today? He points to groupthink and virtue-signaling, trigger warnings and safe spaces, the culture of victimhood, and perhaps most of all, what Ellis views as the tension between the righteousness of rationality and logic and the wrongheadedness of emotion-fueled sensitivity, though he admits that inside his own home that distinction depends on one’s particular point of view.
“He thinks I’m nuts,” Ellis says of his 32-year-old millennial boyfriend of more than a decade now. “I’m over-emotional, I’m a drama queen, I don’t see anything rationally or with logic whatsoever.
“That is where we are,” he says, and laughs.
The book runs in a relaxed chronology, from an adolescence in the Valley focused on horror movies, the beauty of Richard Gere in “American Gigolo,” and the furtive pursuit of porn in the pre-digital age, to the publication of “Less Than Zero,” the unsatisfying adaptation into a movie starring Robert Downey Jr. and Andrew McCarthy, the “American Psycho” controversy, and eventually, his dismay at the dismay of Democrats and the mainstream media at the rise of Trumpism in the United States.
Not because he agrees with Trump on much of anything, but because of his distaste for what he considers the dishonest arguments and overkill with which Trump foes attack him.
“I do think if this had been written, I don’t know, 10 years ago, I would have totally gone after the Tea Party and the birther movement or whatever,” Ellis says. “It’s always an extreme or something that is hysterical or so rooted in kind of fundamentalism that bothers me. I sensed that a lot in the last four years, and it’s just kind of gotten out of control.”
“White” will surely anger some readers, but if they’ve followed Ellis’ writing in fiction, journalism, or social media they shouldn’t be that surprised. His Twitter feed, in particular, was home to some of his darkest humor, eventually sparking so much outrage that he largely abandoned the platform but includes a chapter titled “Tweeting” in the book.”
“I loved Twitter,” he says. “A lot of it was funny, it was exciting. It was to titillate and outrage people, which is what creative people do. That is their instinct, to push boundaries. And then it started morphing.
“I guess it’s about power-grabbing, one group trying to shut down another group. Now it’s all negative, and it is not fun anymore.”
“White” closes with a section on Kanye West, a creative artist who like Ellis has had his share of public controversy. West approached Ellis to write a script for him, and they’ve worked on other projects in recent years, and Ellis says he quickly came to admire West for his iconoclasm and refusal to change to appease his critics.
“He has this notion of freedom that is extremely appealing to a lot of people,” he says. “Regardless of whether you agree with it all or not, he is really his own man. He’s contradictory, he makes mistakes, he falls down, he picks himself up.
“It’s not that I agree with Kanye 100 percent, I don’t,” Ellis says. “But I like the notion of Kanye, and I like that kind of person who is unencumbered by feeling he has to tell a narrative that he doesn’t believe in just to placate the press.”
Like West, Ellis has no interest in pacifying his public critics, though he says at home he and his boyfriend have reached a truce of sorts as the 2020 presidential campaigns begin, and his partner – “a committed Bernie bro” – rededicates himself to MSNBC’s coverage.
“There are two rules in our house,” Ellis says. “We don’t talk about the 2020 presidential election, and we don’t don’t talk about the 2020 presidential election.”
Of course, he is talking about it that moment and eventually, he gets caught.
“He just opened the door and is glaring at me,” Ellis says, interrupting a different line of conversation to give a little play-by-play from his home office. “See? This is how I’m living. He opened the door, glared at me, and hissed. And then he closed the door.
“There it is, in a nutshell,” he says, and then he laughs some more.

Robert Kraft's lawyers request evidence in prostitution case

Texto completo: Lawyers for Robert Kraft on Wednesday asked the Florida prosecutor overseeing the prostitution case against the New England Patriots owner to turn over evidence favorable to Kraft before a high-stakes hearing on video evidence in the case slated for April 26.
Kraft's high-powered legal team made the request, a common procedure in criminal matters, in a letter to Palm Beach County State Attorney Dave Aronberg's office, which is prosecuting Kraft on two misdemeanor counts of soliciting prostitution at a Jupiter, Fla. spa in January.
The 77-year-old Kraft, through his representatives, has denied engaging in criminal activity at Orchids of Asia Day Spa, pleaded not guilty and requested a jury trial. Court records show video cameras secretly installed by police allegedly captured Kraft on two consectuive days receiving sexual favors at the spa in exchange for cash.
The April 26 hearing deals with a motion from Kraft's lawyers to toss the video evidence. The motion, if successful, would bar prosecutors from showing the footage to jurors at trial.
In Wednesday's letter, Kraft's lawyers asked Aronberg's office to “produce, on or before April 12, 2019, all material due to Mr. Kraft pursuant to" established case law. “Such material includes all 'evidence materially favorable' to Mr. Kraft."
Kraft's lawyers maintain that Jupiter police unlawfully obtained a warrant to plant video cameras at Orchids by falsely suggesting the spa may be linked to human trafficking.
Kraft was one of 25 men charged in connection with the multi-day sting at Orchids, which was part of a larger probe across multiple counties looking into possible human trafficking at spas. Neither Kraft nor any of the men ensnared in the sting have been charged with human trafficking.
In Wednesday's letter, Kraft's attorneys requested “any and all information regarding all individuals, male and female, who were surreptitiously recorded inside" Orchids “during the pendency of the 'sneak and peek' search warrant at issue in this action, but who were not charged with any offense and/or were not suspected of unlawful activity."
The defense also requested “any and all information casting doubt on any claim that those working at the Spa were involved in or victims of human trafficking." A footnote to that request said, “As you are aware, your office has already confirmed and conceded that there is no evidence of human trafficking. This demand seeks the direct information upon which that conclusion was reached."
In addition, Kraft's lawyers asked for “any and all information suggesting that Detective Andrew Sharp, affiant for the aforementioned 'sneak and peek' search warrant, provided false or misleading informtion in his affidavit for said warrant, or that those upon whom he relied provided false or misleading information, including any information that calls into question those individuals' credibility."
Finally, Kraft's team requested “any and all information suggesting that Inspector Karen Herzog, the investigator from the Florida Department of Health who conducted a pretextual administrative search of the Spa, provided false or misleading information in her inspection report, including but not limited to any past complaints against Inspector Herzog for bias or for falsification of inspection reports; the findings of any investigations of Inspector Herzog that resulted from such complaints; and any other information that calls into question her credibility."
It wasn't clear if prosecutors have evidence of alleged misconduct on the part of Sharp or Herzog. Aronberg's office hadn't filed a response to the letter from Kraft's legal team as of Thursday morning.
In a separate matter, a hearing is scheduled for Friday in Palm Beach County regarding the battle over the media's access to video evidence in the high-profile case. Kraft's lawyers want the videos sealed pending further order of the court.
An array of media outlets including the Boston Globe oppose the defense request.

Texto completo: In recent days, William Shatner has been to fan events in Michigan and Indiana, for the aptly named "William Shatner Live" - a screening of "The Wrath of Khan" followed by a Q&A with Captain Kirk in the flesh.
Now on his way to Pittsburgh, the 88-year-old actor said such travel was "fairly typical." In a lively phone chat on Tuesday, he talked about his life and career, from "Star Trek's" first captain, James T. Kirk, to his Emmy-winning role on "Boston Legal" to the new frontier of "The UnXplained," coming soon to the History Channel.
He told his story and then some in his one-man show "Shatner's World: We Just Live In It" at the Benedum Center in 2012, and this weekend, fans will have a chance to get autographs, photos and ask questions of their own at the Saturday panel, 4:15-5 p.m. at the Monroeville Convention Center for Steel City Con.
First, he answered a few questions for the Post-Gazette and demonstrated his prowess as a storyteller.
Judging from your schedule, it seems like you are always on the road.
I went out with my one-man show a lot - I went to hundreds of theaters over the years - and then somebody suggested this form of entertainment where we play the movie "The Wrath of Khan" in all its glory, and then I come out afterward and amuse and amaze. That's the touring I've been doing, and then every so often I'll trot out to a convention, and that's what I'm doing in Monroeville.
What's the craziest place you've ever been recognized?
Lots of places. A men's room in New York City. [He laughs.] The answer to that question really is this, and I haven't answered that question in a long time. An American television program wanted me to go out to near Iran, to photograph a black panther at night. And we're sitting in a little tin hut on the Caspian Sea having chicken shawarma, and waaay in the back of this tin hut, by the kitchen, on a tiny black-and-white set, "Star Trek" is playing. And the waiters were dressed up, for some reason, in those big Russian black bear hats .. can you picture this big furry hat and the red tunic? The waiters were like in shabby Russian uniforms serving the chicken, and the guy leaned over and pointed at me and said, "Captain Kirk," in a Russian accent. And I fell into the chicken.
Jordan Peele is remaking "The Twilight Zone," so I rewatched your "Nightmare at 20,000 Feet" episode, which still terrifies me.
I've heard that they are being redone. Because of the volume of content being used up, every so often they say, "Let's take a look at this one again." I guess they are doing that with "Twilight Zone." I, on the other hand, am valiantly trying to interest networks in new projects I would do. Actually, I'm appearing in a new program this year, called "The UnXplained."
What's "The UnXplained" about?
The mysteries that abound, that can't be explained. I'm thinking of one story . 14 young Russians go to the Ural Mountains on a camping trip and are never heard from. When the search parties find them in the snow, they are torn up, as though it were some large animal, but there were no signs of an animal. It's a huge mystery that may have a solution, based on new science today. ["The UnXplained" is a new History Channel docuseries, with Shatner as host and executive producer.]
Patrick Stewart of "Star Trek: The Next Generation" is getting a new Jean-Luc Picard series. Would you have liked to explore Kirk in that way, although he died in the movies?
I wrote seven or eight books involving Captain Kirk. They allowed me to keep him alive in the books, and I kind of traced some of the incidents in my own life, and so some of those books are autobiographical and I had a good time with it. He got married, he got divorced, he had a child, he fell in love, a variety of things that enriched his life. So where would he be? An old married man, I guess.
Any thoughts on the newest "Trek," "Star Trek: Discovery," and that series' young Spock?
I haven't watched it, but I know about it. I had a terrible experience with the young actress [Sonequa Martin-Green, who stars as Michael Burnham]. I was asked to receive a [2018 Creative Arts] Emmy for "Star Trek" and to write some remarks. I rehearsed them backstage with the teleprompter guy, and then the young lady and I walked onstage and our cue to begin speaking was the teleprompter. Then while everybody was standing and applauding, I couldn't even find the teleprompter. And all of a sudden it went on, and there were words that were somewhat unfamiliar, but I said them anyway, and there were words that were familiar, and I read those, and then we finished with a flourish and went offstage - and apparently I said her words as well as mine. She wasn't too happy with me.
You have an Emmy for playing Denny Crane on "Boston Legal," and that was a very political show. Do you ever feel like the news today sounds like a David E. Kelley monologue?
There was an article in The New York Times yesterday about how we're all shellshocked. We're overwhelmed, and I'm just totally overwhelmed. I'm a newsaholic, and I can't bare to watch the news anymore.
How much did growing up in Canada shape your career and who you are today?
I was born in Montreal and went to school and graduated from McGill University there, I joined a professional theater company directly after graduation and went straight on to the Stratford Festival, the great classical company, and I did television and movies in Canada for five years before I came to the States, so it's who I am.
What's it like meeting audiences that include younger generations who are first discovering the original "Star Trek" and Captain Kirk?
Being in front of them is a high-wire act. You want to keep them amused and entertained and laughing or at least informed. It's a spontaneous hour that has no form except what I give it, so I never know what it's going to be. It's unusual, and not many people can do it.
You said fans ask you questions about life, about your roles, about the devices that were on "Star Trek" that are now a part of our daily life ...
You know, Motorola gave me their first StarTAC phone [in 1996], that flipped open, and people would laugh when I made a phone call. Or the fact that you can speak and turn things on and off, and speech to text, I use that all the time.
Is there anything you'd like fans to know about your appearance at Steel City Con?
I'll be there Friday night and I would love to see you all, and I have a panel on Saturday, where I will entertain, and I'm looking forward to a great time with the fans in Monroeville.

Texto completo: Special counsel Robert Mueller's investigators didn't establish that Donald Trump criminally conspired with Russia in the 2016 presidential election. But it wasn't for lack of trying by Moscow.
Russian affiliates made "multiple offers" to help Trump, according to Attorney General William Barr's synopsis of Mueller's report. A presidential campaign with even a shred of security-minded rectitude would have quickly notified the FBI about Russians dangling dirt on an opponent, rather than eagerly taking a meeting, but Team Trump evidently didn't give it a thought.
Now this carelessness has followed the president into the Oval Office where, as it turns out, top-secret clearances are handed out like Halloween candy, and a Chinese woman with a thumb drive of malicious software (along with four cellphones and a laptop) talked her way past the Secret Service recently to enter Trump's "Winter White House" estate in Palm Beach, Florida.
It all adds up to a fast-and-loose attitude toward security:
►News reports last year described scores of White House officials lacking long-term security clearances while background checks dragged on endlessly. Last month, Tricia Newbold — an 18-year career White House employee who handles those reviews — came forward as a whistleblower to reveal how 25 officials who failed background checks were subsequently granted access to the nation's secrets.
The initial denials were based on such concerns as "foreign influence, conflicts of interest, concerning personal conduct, financial problems, drug use and criminal conduct," but higher-ups in the White House ordered denials reversed "without proper analysis, documentation, or a full understanding and acceptance of the risks," according to a summary of Newbold's interview by congressional staffers.
The Washington Post, citing people familiar with documents and testimony provided to the House Oversight and Reform Committee, identified one of the 25 as Trump's son-in-law, senior adviser Jared Kushner, who adjudicators worried might be compromised by foreign influence, outside business activities or personal conduct uncovered in a background check. Even the CIA expressed serious concerns. But Trump intervened to order that Kushner receive top-secret clearance, overruling then-Chief of Staff John Kelly, according to The New York Times.
OPPOSING VIEW: President Trump gets final say on security clearances
►Trump's frequent visits to Mar-a-Lago, his private Florida resort, challenge a Secret Service that says it must defer to club employees in crosschecking visitors. This might explain why Chinese national Yujing Zhang managed to enter the resort March 30 with all her electronic gear. After a receptionist grew suspicious, Zhang was arrested.
Prosecutors said Monday that a search of her hotel room later turned up a slew of additional suspicious items, including a signal detector that can ferret out hidden cameras, another cellphone and nine USB drives. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called the incident evidence of threatening behavior by China. According to the Miami Herald, Zhang's case has been added to an ongoing FBI investigation involving former Florida massage parlor owner Cindy Yang, who has allegedly been selling Chinese businesses access to Mar-a-Lago and the Trump family.
Trump dismissed Zhang's arrest as a fluke ("No, I'm not concerned at all"), but word came Monday that Secret Service Director Randolph Alles is on his way out. Senior Democratic leaders in Congress have rightly asked FBI Director Christopher Wray to assess whether the Mar-a-Lago operation is a national security risk, and one of the new Secret Service director's priorities should be to improve procedures at all of Trump's private clubs. Separately, the House Oversight Committee is investigating how the Trump White House issues security clearances.
When it comes to guarding against foreign influence, it's hard to know whether Trump is naive or foolish, or whether he views the responsibility as a nettlesome inconvenience. Sure, he can vacation where he wants and, by law, hand out clearances to whomever he pleases. But he also has a duty to protect the nation's secrets.

Texto completo: ALBANY — Actress Allison Mack pleaded guilty Monday to federal charges connected to her longtime involvement in NXIVM, a cult-like self-help group in the Albany area whose leader is accused of treating women as sex slaves.
Mack, 36, best known for her role as Chloe Sullivan in the CW's "Smallville," signed a plea agreement late Monday morning in Brooklyn federal court, admitting to two racketeering felonies that could put her behind bars for years when she is sentenced in September.
Mack had been facing seven federal felonies in connection with her role as a high-ranking leader in DOS, a group secretly led by NXIVM co-founder and spiritual leader Keith Raniere that purported to be a women's empowerment sorority.
Federal prosecutors said the DOS group was essentially a sex ring to benefit Raniere, with women known as "slaves" who reported to "masters" who ultimately reported directly to him and were wholly devoted to his teachings.
Mack's plea came the same day jury selection began for the NXIVM trial. Now, three defendants remain, including Raniere and Segram's liquor heiress Clare Bronfman, the group's major funder.
"I believed Keith Raniere's intentions were to help people, and I was wrong," Mack said in court, according to The Associated Press.
"I know I can and will be a better person," she said.
Prosecutors say Mack was a co-conspirator, recruiting women to join the master-slave group. She reported directly to Raniere.
The women, some of whom were branded with a logo containing Raniere's initials, were presented to him for sex and forced to follow restrictive diets to adhere to his preferred body type, according to prosecutors.
They were also forced to give up collateral — nude photos, family secrets — in order to join the group. DOS leaders threatened to release the information if the women publicly revealed the group's existence, prosecutors claim.
Mack's plea deal Monday had her admit to using the threat of extortion to force lower-level DOS members to give up their personal collateral and forcing a woman (identified only as a Jane Doe) to perform manual labor under threat.
Under the agreement, five charges were dismissed, including three related to sex trafficking.
She faces up to 40 years in prison when she is sentenced Sept. 11, though sentencing guidelines will likely call for less than the maximum.
In recent weeks, federal prosecutors have acknowledged in court that Mack and some of her co-defendants had been engaged in plea negotiations.
Nancy Salzman, NXIVM co-founder and president, pleaded guilty last month to one count of racketeering conspiracy, confessing to stealing email addresses and passwords of NXIVM critics and altering a tape used in a lawsuit against one.
Her daughter, Lauren Salzman, also pleaded guilty to racketeering and racketeering conspiracy last month.
With Mack's expected plea, three defendants remain: Raniere, Bronfman and Kathy Russell, a NXIVM bookkeeper.
Raniere, 58, attended high school in Suffern, Rockland County, before moving to the Albany area to attend the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. He gained a devoted following through NXIVM, which taught expensive self-help classes that were based on Raniere's teachings.
But Raniere's critics — including former girlfriend Toni Natalie, of the Rochester area, who has spoken out publicly against him for years — have long accused NXIVM of operating like a cult, aggressively suing former members who went on to criticize the group.
Federal prosecutors got involved after Sarah Edmondson, an actress from Vancouver, went public in an account in The New York Times with news that women in DOS, the secret sorority, had been branded on their pubic region with Raniere's initials.
The account also detailed "Dynasty" star Catherine Oxenberg's fight to rescue her daughter from the group.

Actress in 'Sex Cult' Case Admits to Racketeering

Texto completo: [What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox .]
Allison Mack tearfully told a judge on Monday that she first joined the cultlike group known as Nxivm to "find purpose." She was unsatisfied with her acting career, she said, despite her role on the successful television series "Smallville."
Led by Keith Raniere, the group, based in Albany, billed itself as a self-help organization. It offered workshops and classes that promised participants greater self-fulfillment.
Ms. Mack became so involved, federal prosecutors said, that she began recruiting other women into a secret sect within Nxivm in which women were branded with Mr. Raniere's initials and were forced to have sex with him.
"I was lost," Ms. Mack said on Monday, while pleading guilty to racketeering and racketeering conspiracy charges related to her role in the group.
In a lengthy, tear-filled confession at Federal District Court in Brooklyn, Ms. Mack admitted to luring women into Nxivm (pronounced NEX-ee-um), where they were extorted and coerced into following Mr. Raniere's orders.
"I must take full responsibility for my conduct," Ms. Mack, 36, said.
The racketeering counts were among the least lurid ones that Ms. Mack faced. When the actress was arrested last year, she was also charged with sex trafficking and conspiracy to commit sex trafficking and forced labor.
Her arrest was part of a larger federal case against high-ranking members of Nxivm, including Mr. Raniere and four others. Federal authorities had begun investigating the organization after The New York Times published an article in late 2017 detailing the inner workings of the secret sorority within Nxivm.
Ms. Mack's Hollywood ties boosted the case's profile and grabbed headlines. After prosecutors announced the charges against her, other actresses said that Ms. Mack had tried to get them to join her "women's group." Several female journalists also shared that they had received emails from Ms. Mack trying to pitch them on joining a female empowerment organization.
Prosecutors said the secret sect's purpose within Nxivm was to groom sexual partners for Mr. Raniere, who is 58. It was called D.O.S., an acronym for a Latin phrase that roughly translates to "Lord/Master of the Obedient Female Companions," court papers said.
In court on Monday, Ms. Mack admitted she recruited women into the group by telling them they were going to become members of a female mentorship program.
Her goal, she said, was to promote Mr. Raniere's teachings and help him further his objectives. She was so dedicated to doing so, she said, that she engaged in criminal conduct.
Ms. Mack said that to become members of the secret D.O.S. group, women were required to offer up "personally damaging or ruinous" information. The group also collected explicit photos and videos from members as well as rights to their properties, she said.
Prosecutors have said that the women were warned that the damaging or embarrassing information would be made public if they revealed the existence of the group.
Ms. Mack admitted on Monday that she wielded the information to blackmail the women into performing services for her and the group. The organization was set up to make women think "they could suffer serious harm" if they did not follow orders, she said.
The D.O.S. group was organized into circles of women "slaves" that were led by "masters," prosecutors said. When Ms. Mack was arrested last year, officials said that she had recruited women into the society as "slaves" and had required them to have sex with Mr. Raniere.
But in her plea before the court, Ms. Mack did not directly address whether women were coerced into having sex with the group's leader. She did admit that she had obtained "labor and services" from two anonymous women who were mentioned in the indictment.
Ms. Mack sobbed so much as she gave her statement that Judge Nicholas G. Garaufis interrupted to ask if she was all right. Ms. Mack then apologized to those that she hurt through her "misguided adherence to Keith Raniere's teachings."
Ms. Mack's biography on her website, which was no longer active on Monday but could still be accessed in archives, mentioned that Mr. Raniere had mentored her after "Smallville" ended in 2011.
As she spent more time with the group and with Mr. Raniere, she said in court, she was persuaded into believing Mr. Raniere's messages would be beneficial to others.
But almost a year after her arrest, Ms. Mack said that she had concluded through introspection and "self-examination" that Mr. Raniere and some of his followers had broken the law.
Last month, one of the group's co-founders, Nancy Salzman, shared the same sentiment when she pleaded guilty to charges in the case. Two weeks later, her daughter, Lauren Salzman, also pleaded guilty to racketeering conspiracy and racketeering counts.
Others charged in the case include Mr. Raniere and Clare Bronfman, an heiress to the Seagram's liquor fortune.
Ms. Mack faces up to 20 years in prison on each count to which she pleaded guilty. She is scheduled to be sentenced in September.
It was unclear whether Ms. Mack will be entering into a cooperation deal with federal prosecutors. Her lawyer declined to comment outside the courthouse and did not respond to phone or email requests.
The trial of the remaining defendants in the case is scheduled to begin later this month.

Texto completo: The United States spends far too much money locking up far too many people for far too long.
A few years ago, a politician had to be brave to say anything like that out loud. Now it's a mainstream and bipartisan view.
In a 2018 survey conducted for the American Civil Liberties Union, 59 percent of respondents said they would be more likely to support than oppose a candidate who supports reducing the prison population. Achieving that goal is now an accomplishment that politicians showcase. In January, Congress by wide margins passed the First Step Act to reduce some drug sentences and improve conditions in federal prisons. President Trump, despite painting a frightening picture of crime-ridden "American carnage" at his inauguration, invited the first drug offender released as a result to the State of the Union address.
It's all pretty head-spinning after decades of elected officials competing to lock more people up and spotlight the scariest crimes. Now, with public opinion shifting far and fast and politicians hurrying to catch up, you could even argue that criminal justice reform has become the new marriage equality in terms of the turnaround in public attitudes.
That presents a major opportunity for Democratic presidential candidates. But for all the energy behind reform, no presidential candidate has articulated a big, comprehensive vision for transformational change. There's a consensus that the system is broken, but no agreement on how to fix it.
The presidential candidate seeking to distinguish herself might start by looking at a new wave of reform-minded district attorneys who are challenging conventional law-and-order approaches in red states and blue ones.
For the candidates, thematically, a starting point should be that wealth should not determine a person's fate in court, and profit should not drive the system. Bail bonds, privatized probation and corporate-run prisons are parasitic features of the justice system. Ending cash bail should be at the top of every candidate's criminal justice agenda. So should getting rid of fines and fees that help fund local governments but trap people in cycles of debt.
Ferguson, Mo., became a symbol of the criminalization of poverty for routinely sending black defendants to jail for failing to pay minor traffic fines. But last November, a new district attorney, Wesley Bell, was elected. On his first day in office, he announced one of the most progressive bail policies in the country -- pretrial release, without bail, for misdemeanors and some felonies, unless the prosecutor thinks there is a direct threat to public safety.
Mr. Bell also said his office would no longer seek to revoke probation for unpaid fines and fees. "As an overriding principle, I do not believe in prosecuting poverty," he told a weekly newspaper, The St. Louis American.
The old Ferguson lives on elsewhere. In Texas, 524,000 people were jailed in 2018 for unpaid traffic tickets. Even short stays for nonviolent offenses can wreak havoc with people's jobs and child care. Sparing them needless punishment matters for their lives.
To end mass incarceration, however, exempting nonviolent offenses from jail time isn't enough. People convicted of violent crimes make up more than half of the country's state prison population. But the image of prisons overflowing with murderers and rapists is wrong. In many states, "violent felonies" include offenses like breaking into an empty house or snatching a purse or iPhone on the street. Reducing sentences for these offenses -- and changing what counts as a violent felony to begin with -- can lower this share of the prison population.
And that fits in with a second theme for candidates: People deserve a second chance, because many grow and change. They robbed to feed an addiction and then got sober. They assaulted someone because they were mentally ill and then got treatment and stabilized. They mature as they age beyond their teens and early 20s. That's why it makes sense to reconsider how long a person should stay in prison after doing some time.
At last, a few prosecutors are doing this and are moving to correct the heavy sentences handed down in the past. The elected prosecutor in Seattle, Dan Satterberg, has won 21 commutations or resentencings for people serving life or decades. Three of the people released -- brothers -- are back in prison for new crimes, including one for a killing, but the other 18 are "taking full advantage of their freedom," Mr. Satterberg put it.
"Our obligation to do justice continues to go backward as well as forward," he said. "Yes, we'll have failures, but one way to manage that is more re-entry support for people."
Parole offers another opening for second chances. In Texas, says Scott Henson, an activist who blogs at the site Grits for Breakfast, "our parole rates have gone from 15 percent to the high 30s in the last decade," He said the increase is "having more impact than any bill we've passed even through the legislature." He thinks the reason for the rise is a humdrum logistical one: The state unofficially uses parole as a way to reduce prison overcrowding.
We should also focus on redefining the terms of the public safety debate. Ending mass incarceration, and ensuring fairness throughout the criminal justice system, aren't in tension with public safety. It is integral to it. People tend to uphold the law when they believe it's reasonable and applied evenly. When people have that faith, they are more likely to help the police solve crimes.
With only about 60 percent of murder cases resulting in arrest or other resolutions -- that percentage is even lower for other crimes -- disillusionment may be our biggest safety threat. After Baltimore's district attorney, Marilyn Mosby, announced in January that her office would stop prosecuting marijuana possession, a group of mothers whose children were killed in the city mounted a mobile billboard. "Stop Pot Arrests," it read. "Solve Murders Instead."
In a comprehensive new blueprint for reform, the Justice Collaborative, a nonprofit group, makes an underappreciated and crucial point: "Law enforcement is not the only, or even the most important, answer to addressing cycles of violence."
Adam Foss, president of Prosecutor Impact, which conducts training for prosecutors, said politicians can be explicit about this approach: "If you're serious about tackling violence, you talk about how to prevent it. You talk about how trauma drives violence among groups the public can get behind, like young people, women and veterans. You adopt language used by the doctors and surgeons working on the front lines of this scourge of violence who have been saying for years that it is a public health issue.
"You talk about stable housing and equal access to education and health care," he continued. "You center it around the survivor community begging for alternative solutions. And you tie it back to public safety so you're changing the terms of the debate."
Finally, incarceration should be the last resort, not the default. In Brooklyn, District Attorney Eric Gonzalez has said this idea is central to his tenure. His counterpart in Boston, Rachael Rollins, last month instructed prosecutors to ask for jail only "when any other recommendation would compromise" safety.
When no option other than jail or prison will do, it's important to remember that the vast majority of people who go in also get out. Making sure they have the tools to lead productive lives when they emerge -- like job training and access to decent housing -- is a public good.
Presidents don't actually control the key levers of the American punishment machine. About 80 percent of the people who are locked up today are in state and local jails and prisons. But presidents, and presidential campaigns, can raise the profile of an issue and set a tone. The way they talk about repairing our broken criminal justice system speaks loudly to broader issues about racial and wealth inequality. Presidents can also shape the behavior of states and cities with funding and other incentives, like redirecting money for treatment and prevention programs.
Though some prosecutors and state legislatures are now embarking on serious reforms, there's still so much further to go. Bipartisan support is increasing but still has to build. The candidate for president who makes that happen can reap political benefits -- and more important, make America so much better.

Texto completo: Ruth Reichl's latest memoir, "Save Me the Plums," covers her years as editor in chief of Gourmet from 1999 until the magazine folded a decade later. It's a chronicle of Reichl's conflicted feelings about success: her ambition to remake a legendary food magazine that had become out of touch, and her disconnect as an ordinary, subway-riding New Yorker seduced into a world of limos, luxury travel and Anna Wintour-grade privilege that marked Conde Nast's years of glory under media baron Si Newhouse.
Reichl, 71, has held some of the most prestigious jobs in food writing. She was the restaurant critic for the New York Times through most of the 1990s. From 1984 until '93, she worked at the Los Angeles Times as food critic and eventually as editor of a remade food section. (Reichl hired Laurie Ochoa and her husband, the late Jonathan Gold, for the L.A. Times. Both followed her to New York to work at Gourmet; "Save Me the Plums" is dedicated to them. Ochoa is currently The Times' arts and entertainment editor.)
Yet Reichl has long written in the voice of the ecstatic everyperson: someone uncomfortable with the trappings of luxury, but with a devotion to beautiful food. It's this ambivalence that's always made Reichl's persona relatable. She's the everlasting Berkeley radical (Reichl helped run a co-op restaurant there from 1973 to '77 while writing about food for New West magazine), declaring deliciousness as the ultimate political act. And even as she swooned over foie gras ravioli at Le Cirque in Manhattan in 1997, she clung to her outsider persona.

"Don't be seduced," she tells herself in her review for the New York Times, seated in one of Le Cirque's velvet high-backed chairs. "You don't really belong to this club." Even though, at that moment, she wielded more power and influence than any other food writer in the country.
The one time I saw Reichl in person was in 2014, at David Chang's Ma Peche in New York City, at an after-party for the James Beard Journalism and Media Awards. Reichl had stationed herself at a narrow pass through the now-shuttered Midtown restaurant, where she could see (and be clocked by) everyone coming in. I was too shy to introduce myself that night, but I noticed how awkward she looked, as if she were both queen of the revels and someone, like me, who felt out of place. As much as anyone there that night, Reichl belonged. I talked to her by phone recently about guilt, Gourmet, the state of food writing today, and her pride in what she, Ochoa and Gold created, long ago, at the L.A. Times.
--
First I have to ask you about the title, "Save Me the Plums," obviously a reference to the William Carlos Williams poem "This Is Just to Say" ("I have eaten / the plums / that were in / the icebox," etc.). That poem became something of a Twitter meme. Is that what brought it to mind?
I have loved this poem for a long time. It makes you see a plum differently than you've ever seen it before. And I remembered my father -- he was a book designer -- designed "The Autobiography of William Carlos Williams," a Random House book [from 1951] that included the poem. So it's a book that had been hanging around my house my whole life. The poem, you read it and think, well, food had a bigger meaning for Williams than just, "Oh, it's delicious." It's what I was trying to do with Gourmet: Take it to a place where it was more than just, "Make these dishes and travel to these fancy places." It's also the spareness of Williams' writing. One of the other things I wanted to do with the magazine was get "writerliness" in there. So the poem worked for me in all those ways and for the notion that Gourmet was a plum job.
--
Clearly, you felt guilty about taking this plum job, about selling your soul to food at a big fancy magazine. Did you write this memoir to come to terms with your guilt?
I feel like I've spent my whole life trying to reconcile that urge to pleasure with food and the whole side of food that is life-affirming with the other side, which is what does it mean for us to be eating all the plums when half the world is starving? Don't we have to think about that? For me, food has always been a way, literally, of seeing the world, but what does it mean that I'm telling people to go out and spend a lot of money on food? We're in a moment now when food people are actually thinking about these issues, and I think that's great.
--
Just like you in the book, trying to come to terms with the excesses of life at Conde Nast in that era, with all its juicy perks. It took you a couple of years to even take advantage of having your own company-supplied car and driver.
Yeah, I don't want to be that person. I never have wanted to be that person. So yeah, I was really reluctant. I mean, it was nice to not to have to think about money for the first time in my life. The thing you come, ultimately, to realize is that the biggest luxury in life is feeling safe and not worrying about money. It's the only luxury that really matters.
--
I wanted to ask you about your time at the Los Angeles Times in the 1980s and early '90s, as critic and food section editor, and how it shaped what you did later at Gourmet.
It's probably the thing I've done in my life that I'm most proud of. And I was really lucky in that I didn't do it alone. There was a staff there, but mostly it was me and Laurie [Ochoa] and Jonathan [Gold], but mostly me and Laurie going in there and really thinking, "What should a food section be?" We had this section that brought in $32 million a year in advertising. It was another time, when supermarkets were still in competition, so Vons would take 10 pages, and then A&P would take 10 pages. It was just this giant cash cow. And we had this kitchen, with this staff of three and a photo studio -- I mean, we had incredible resources. And we really did set out to explore the city from the point of view of food. It was like, "Look at your neighbors!" Let's walk every block of Chinatown and go in and out of the stores and talk about what you do with all the stuff that's in there. It was amazing. I mean, we really had fun with it. We were young, just a different generation from the mostly women who had been putting that section together. We didn't know that there was anything we couldn't do. And the supermarkets were furious with what we'd done, because suddenly we were running real articles. Before us, they had owned the food section, pretty much.
--
And you stole Jonathan Gold away from L.A. Weekly to do "Counter Intelligence" in the L.A. Times.
Well, it wasn't too hard. Laurie and Jonathan were living together. And really, I had hired Laurie because Jonathan said, "You should hire my girlfriend." I think it was very much all of us, together, and we were all excited about food. Jonathan had the L.A. sensibility, and I had the Berkeley sensibility. I came at it with a real political interest in food, and Jonathan's was more local -- he'd already been eating up and down Pico! And so I think it was the three of us putting our joint but different ideas about food together.
--
I have to ask you about the new generation of food writers, women of color like Tejal Rao, the L.A.-based food writer for the New York Times, and the San Francisco Chronicle's Soleil Ho, among the current stars of food writing.
And the L.A. Times' food critic Patricia Escarcega, who's great too. I edited "Best American Food Writing" last year, and I was so excited by all the stuff I read. It's like, this new generation of people who are thinking about food in a fascinating way that encompasses everything in the world. It makes me ashamed that I didn't move farther faster. I hope they push the envelope as far and as fast as they possibly can. I think this new generation, it's what we always dreamed of, that people would take food really seriously, and that means thinking about who's picking your food, who's cooking your food, who's doing the dishes. Thank God people are thinking about that. I think it's hard for younger people to understand how little interest there was in food in the '60s and '70s and '80s -- it was a niche thing. Now, it's a real part of popular culture.
--
You say that you feel ashamed for not going further. Do you feel complicit in perpetuating the face of whiteness and maleness in food culture?
Well, I had Gourmet and I didn't try harder. We didn't put a lot of chefs on the cover, but we only put one woman. I should have tried harder. We didn't do enough women chef profiles. Everybody was thinking: "We should have more coverage of chefs of color." They were hard to find in 2000, but I should have tried harder. I have felt the responsibility that maybe it was up to me to make sure they weren't so hard to find.
--
In "Save Me the Plums" you have a scene with Mario Batali at a Gourmet party, and you have a moment of reflection about the #MeToo movement.
I've done just about everything you can do in a restaurant. I haven't been a chef, but I've worked in restaurants a lot, and I've worked in newspapers and magazines a lot. I never found the restaurant culture one bit different than the publishing culture. We all knew about this macho culture in restaurants, but there was macho culture in newsrooms too. And one of the things that I'm ashamed of is that I accepted it -- we all did, all the women of my generation. It was transactional, right? You just took it for granted that men were going to come on to you, talk dirty to you. We accepted it, and we should never have, but it was just the way of the world. It never occurred to us. I'm so happy that women aren't accepting it anymore.

Texto completo: Magnus and Alex decamp to the glittering City of Light for their first-ever vacation together.
They gaze at Paris from atop the Eiffel Tower observation deck, glide over the Seine in a hot air balloon — and watch a swarm of demons soar over the rooftops, which means it’s time for Alec to get out his bow and arrows.
Such is life for a couple in Cassandra Clare’s universe. Clare unveiled the “Mortal Instruments” world of Shadowhunters, part-angel warriors who police the demons on Earth, in 2007 with “City of Bones.” Since then, she’s written five more "Mortal Instruments" books, a three-volume prequel series, two sequel trilogies, and several stand-alones – plus co-authored an entire other series. There was a “Mortal Instruments” film in 2016 starring Lily Collins, and a “Shadowhunters” television series on Freeform.
Now comes “The Red Scrolls of Magic” (Margaret K. McElderry Books/Simon & Schuster, $24.99), the first book in the “Eldest Curses” series featuring reader-fave couple Magnus and Alex. Clare co-authored “Scrolls” with Wesley Chu, and both will be in Austin on Tuesday, the day the book publishes.
“In 2012 I published ‘City of Fallen Angels,’ and … Magnus and Alec are significant supporting characters. During that book, they disappear on vacation, and they come back and won’t talk about it, but it’s obvious that something important happened,” Clare explained recently in a phone interview. “I always had the thought that I would go back
and write the story of what happened to them during that time period.”
Part of the challenge was finding time to write “Scrolls” between other commitments. And just as crucial, she says, was having a story centered on a gay couple be promoted and treated like any other book.
“I was often told that school libraries wouldn’t carry these books, or that I wasn’t welcome to speak at a school because I feature these characters,” she says.
With the increased push for inclusion of all types in young adult literature, the market was ripe for stories of all kinds featuring gay characters, from coming-out stories to tales like Clare and Chu’s, which are adventures in which the main characters happen to be gay.
Authentic inclusion also prompted Clare’s push to have a co-author like Chu, a celebrated science-fiction author who shares Magnus’ Asian heritage: “We’re really digging into Magnus’ history, and Wes is a man of color who could speak to Magnus’ background. … It’s a significant responsibility,” Clare says. “You can’t walk away from the world you’ve created; you have to make it more inclusive. You’re going to have to write the experience that’s not your experience. The only other choice is to leave them out entirely, and that would be wrong.” (Ages 14 and older)

The porcine wonder Mercy Watson has starred in six New York Times-bestselling chapter books from author Kate DiCamillo and illustrator Chris van Dusen. Now the pair have teamed on a prequel, “A Piglet Named Mercy” (Candlewick Press, $18.99), the picture-book story of how Mercy came to live with the Watson family.
Mr. and Mrs. Watson live an entirely unexceptional life on Deckawoo Drive. Mr. Watson is satisfied with their predictable existence. Mrs. Watson, not so much: “It’s just that sometimes, I wish something different would happen.”
Enter a tiny piglet, who falls off the back of the farm truck and lands on the Watsons’ front porch next to the newspaper. A busybody neighbor (and her entranced younger sister) round out this origin story.
DiCamillo and Dusen will be at BookPeople at 6:30 p.m. April 16.
(Ages 2-5, although older fans of the chapter-book series also will be interested.)
Adam Rubin and Daniel Salmieri paired to create the “Dragons Love Tacos” empire of picture books. Now they’re (figuratively) holding up their hands and inviting young readers to do the same with “High Five” (Dial/Penguin, $19.99), a picture-book tutorial on extreme high-five.
Can your young reader do the “supermarket sweep”? The “king of the jungle”? The “windmill”? Whimsical rhymes from Rubin, who will be in Austin later this month, accent Salmieri’s simple and colorful pencil drawings, all printed on heavier-than-usual paper to encourage an interactive experience.
Slap palms with Rubin at BookPeople at 4 p.m. April 29, which also happens to be the first day of the 100th annual Children’s Book Week — the longest-running national literacy campaign in the United States. (Ages 3-5)

Texto completo: Methodist leaders in U.S. plot to reverse or weaken global church's decision
When the United Methodist Church voted to uphold its ban on same-sex marriage and LGBT clergy last month, Methodist pastors and churchgoers across America were devastated. A majority of American delegates had voted against the plan, though they were outvoted by more conservative delegates from Africa and other continents.
In the District, churches hung banners supporting their LGBT congregants and took out a newspaper ad to proclaim their welcome. Some spoke of whether to remain in the denomination.
In the weeks since the vote, several small but powerful cadres of pastors and bishops in the Washington area and across the country have begun plotting paths to overturn or undermine the decision. In conference calls and clandestine meetings, the disparate groups are discussing options that include splitting the church into two denominations and withholding funds until the pressure prompts the denomination to redo the recent vote at the next worldwide meeting in May 2020 in Minneapolis.
"We've either got to figure out how we go together [with same-sex marriage], or how we separate," declared North Georgia's Bishop Sue Haupert-Johnson, a co-leader of one of the groups.
Most of these pastors say they would greatly prefer a negotiated solution rather than leaving the United Methodist denomination, which has more than 6 million members in the United States and is the largest mainline Protestant church in the country.
The Rev. Adam Hamilton, who is the pastor of the largest Methodist church in the country, with 20,000 members in his Kansas City congregation, is organizing with Haupert-Johnson, Texas's Bishop Michael McKee and a few others.
Their group has a methodical, political-organizing-style plan for drawing others into their fight: meetings last week and this week in Dallas and Atlanta, each with 30 handpicked clergy and leaders, including seven LGBT leaders. Then a meeting at Hamilton's church in May for 500 leaders. Then another meeting in the fall, where they aim to draw 3,000 leaders of Methodist churches.
"I've been astounded at the number of emails, phone calls, text messages I'm receiving from churches across the country saying we can't live like this," Hamilton said. "These churches, they're centrist. But they're saying this doesn't feel like the United Methodism that we have always known and loved. To be in a church that will be in the future led by the most conservative caucus in our denomination feels untenable for them."
The vote in February, at a special session of more than 800 leaders of the church intended to settle the years-long fight over sexuality, ended up with 53 percent of voters supporting the "traditional plan" - keeping the ban on same-sex marriage and gay clergy and imposing harsher penalties on those who break the rules.
The solutions now offered by those who want to keep the church together do not sound workable to many who voted against the plan.
Bishop Kenneth Carter of Florida, for instance, favored a plan that would have allowed local pastors to choose for themselves whether to perform same-sex marriages. In light of the new penalties - a minimum one-year suspension without pay for the first wedding, and permanent removal from ministry for the second - he is advising a different approach to pastors who ask him about performing a same-sex wedding.
"They could do the premarital counseling. They could read Scripture, they could give communion, they could give the homily. The only thing I discourage them from doing is the vows or signing the license," he said.
A wedding in which the pastor cannot participate in the central elements that make it a wedding, unsurprisingly, is not enough for many pastors. Instead, they are plotting to resist the traditional plan.
"Right after the conference, people were saying, 'Are we going to leave? Is there going to be a new denomination?' Not today. There's millions of people involved. You can't form a new denomination by Thursday," said the Rev. James Howell, a nationally known Methodist writer and pastor of a 5,000-member church in Charlotte. Howell said he has been invited to participate in meetings, online discussions and phone calls with pastors across the country to come up with strategies.
"I don't know anybody who thinks we can continue to stay together with what we have now. I was someone who dreamed of that for a long time . . . It's sad, but it's just not viable," he said last week, fresh off a phone call among pastors discussing how to split into two different Methodist denominations, one of which would affirm same-sex marriage. "People on a call like this, we're talking to each other because we dream of, we believe in a beautiful, fresh, lovely form of Methodism."
Hamilton said that before his group's first meetings in Atlanta and Dallas, he envisions two possibly viable paths: splitting and resistance. If the group opts for resistance, it would probably be financial, he said. Numerous large American churches like his would stop contributing their customary funds to the denomination, in the hope that delegates from Africa and Russia - who led the successful push at last month's meeting to block same-sex marriage and gay clergy - would agree to a new vote at the 2020 meeting on LGBT issues, to preserve funding for their mission projects.
His second option would involve persuading all parts of the American church - both progressives and centrists who want same-sex marriage, as well as conservatives who want to separate and be done with the debate - to pool their voting power in favor of a split into separate denominations. American churches that favor same-sex marriage would opt into one denomination; most African and Russian churches as well as American churches that oppose same-sex marriage would be in the other one.
A vision for a new denomination will be a major topic at the under-the-radar meetings: practical questions, like how a split church could share existing institutions such as schools and hospitals, and religious ones.
"I think this is a spiritual exercise," said Haupert-Johnson, who favors a split into two denominations, saying she believes population demographics mean Americans will increasingly be under the thumb of African voters unless they split. "How do we go about this in a way that you know is of God, led by God? . . . How do we sense that the Holy Spirit is leading the church now? . . . If the Methodist church has to get leaner and nicer, I'm all for it. I'm tired of the meanness. I'm tired of the pettiness. I'm tired of the fighting to win at all costs."
One signal of the bitterness of the recent battles: The church is investigating, because of an inquiry from a New York Times report that raised concerns about four voters, whether some people who were not authorized to vote cast ballots in favor of the traditional plan. Leaders opposed to the traditional plan say they highly doubt a few improper votes swayed the outcome, but the allegations of vote tampering still left them feeling saddened that a church deliberative process could turn out looking like a sordid political fight.
Yet no one thinks the fighting will end soon. Howell compared the battles that are still to come to some of the most famous in American history. "How did the American Revolution happen?" he said. "At first, there wasn't some super-organized network. Different places, different people didn't like what the British authorities were doing. So they had a tea party in Boston. Stuff started breaking up all over the place."
Methodism's war is not over with this vote, he said. Its tea party moment is only about to begin.

Texto completo: LOVE ALWAYS WINS
ATLANTA - Taraji P. Henson loves embodying strong female characters who don't take guff from anybody.
In the period drama "The Best of Enemies," out today (April 5), Henson plays Ann Atwater, a civil rights activist in Durham, North Carolina, who helps integrate schools there in 1971 with an unforeseen assist from C.P. Ellis, a local Klu Klux Klan chapter leader played with surprising empathy by Sam Rockwell.
In fact, Ann and C.P. ended up becoming life-long friends.
If this film weren't actually based on a true story, it would be hard to believe.
"They were both very courageous," said Henson at a press junket last month at the Four Seasons Hotel in Atlanta. "That's why they gelled. They were one and the same."
While "Roughhouse Annie," as Henson's character was nicknamed, wore unflattering, often frumpy dresses, Henson thinks she and her far more stylish Cookie character on "Empire" would have become fast friends.
"I don't think Cookie would have judged her because Ann was not rich," Henson said. "Cookie would look up to her for her boldness. Ann was the voice for the voiceless, for people who couldn't take up for themselves."
The film, shot in 2017 largely in Carters-ville and Macon, Georgia, captures a time in Raleigh when the Klan was an active presence following the tumultuous 1960s. Schools remained segregated 17 years after Brown v. the Board of Education.
The most insidious character in a sense was not Ellis but a city councilman played by Bruce McGill, who presented himself in public as more "progressive" in terms of race relations but privately continued to pull strings to ensure the status quo. The Klan, for him, was a pawn and C.P. eventually realized he was being used.
How the city at the time managed to get so many disparate groups in single room was through a charette. It was a concept that was used mostly in business circles to resolve conflicts in a systematic way.
Bill Riddick, a black man and consultant, came up with a way to use the charette to deal with school integration and this particular town decided to give it a try. Riddick, who is still alive, showed up on set in 2017 as an advisor. "He was instrumental in making sure the arguments we had in the film were accurate," said Dominique Telson, a co-executive producer.
Telson said Riddick found both Ann and C.P. insufferable at first. One of the funniest scenes was when Riddick forced blacks and whites to sit together during lunch and talk. Ann and C.P. at first acted like angry elementary schoolchildren. But as the characters got to know each other, their relationship became a friendship.
"The key is something we can still use today which is you have to stop fighting and start listening for once. He says that in the film. That's the goal of the charette. He didn't choose sides. He just wanted both sides to talk and sometimes you can get a great outcome."
Henson said social media is now just the opposite: people hurling insults at each other, digging in their heels rather than seeking common ground.
"I think the world needs a big charette," Henson said. "What I learned from Ann is change is worth fighting for and you must become the change you want to see."
Once Ann stopped fighting with KKK man C.P., "when she tapped into her Christianity and loved him with the love of God unconditional and all inclusive, that's how she was able to get him to change."
Henson hopes the film sends a positive message that "love always wins. Hate never does. Hate's objective is to destroy. If hate wins, mankind is destroyed. Love will keep us alive. It means loving the enemy."
While critics felt Oscar voters gave "The Green Book" this year's best picture Academy Award because it made white folks feel good, Henson said "The Best of Enemies" should make "everyone feel good and leave the movie with a sense of hope. I don't think there's a white savior. If anything, I think Ann saves C.P. She saves herself. By saving herself, she saves him."

D.C. Memo: The heart-iest of heartland memos

Texto completo: The D.C. Memo is a weekly recap of Washington political news, journalism, and opinion, delivered with an eye toward what matters for Minnesota. Sign up to get it in your inbox every Thursday.
Welcome to the latest edition of the D.C. Memo, which — much like Fred Trump — wasn’t born in a very wonderful town in Germany. This week, Trump’s latest health care effort has the lifespan of a mayfly; the White House had “only” four or five very serious security clearance problems, and Kloby pitches infrastructure to Iowa.
So let’s get to it.
Three big things
Welcome to The Party of Health … nevermind: This week, President Donald Trump announced Republicans would not, in fact, engage in political hara-kiri by trying to replace Obamacare with “something great” before the 2020 election. After being told by Majority Leader Mitch McConnell that the Senate had zero appetite for taking on the issue, Trump issued a series of tweets Monday night making it clear that Republicans would have an awesome plan … in 2021:
“The Republicans are developing a really great HealthCare Plan with far lower premiums (cost) & deductibles than ObamaCare,” wrote Trump.
“In other words it will be far less expensive & much more usable than ObamaCare,” he said. “Vote will be taken right after the Election when Republicans hold the Senate & win back the House.”
Translated: the only way there will be another attempt to replace the Affordable Care Act is if 1.) Donald Trump wins a second term, 2.) Republicans hold on to the Senate in 2020, and 3.) Republicans manage to take back the House in 2020. So: Easy!
For a host of reasons, not the least of which is the fact that health care was the single biggest reason Democrats gained 40 seats and took control of the House in 2018, a whole bunch of Republicans weren’t exactly bummed out by this development. Indeed, as Bloomberg’s Sahil Kapur and Laura Litvan explained: “Most congressional Republicans … are in no mood to return to that battlefield. Although they had fiercely opposed the law since 2010, it gradually became more popular with voters … In the House elections, health care ranked as the top issue for voters. Those voters preferred Democratic candidates by a striking margin of 75 percent to 23 percent, according to exit polls published by CNN. Democrats won 40 seats and captured the majority after eight years.”
Which hardly means Obamacare is out of the woods, exactly, since there is still the lawsuit being led by the state Texas pending before the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals — a suit that argues the ACA is unconstitutional and should be struck down. And though legal experts say the lawsuit is something of a long shot, the Justice Department, after initially saying the law should be partially overturned, changed its position last week and said Obamacare should be fully invalidated, a move that kicked off this whole policy walkabout.
Surely you can’t be very serious: The same day McConnell told Trump the Senate wasn’t going anywhere near health care, the staff of the House Committee on Oversight and Reform released a 10-page memo highlighting testimony given to them by whistleblower Patricia Newell, an 18-year veteran of the White House’s Personnel Security Office. In late March, Newell had told the committee that senior Trump officials had given security clearances to at least 25 people whose applications had been flagged for “disqualifying issues” by career personnel employees.
As the Times recounts: “Ms. Newbold told the committee’s staff members that she and other career officials had denied the 25 applications for a variety of reasons, including ‘foreign influence, conflicts of interest, concerning personal conduct, financial problems, drug use and criminal conduct,’ the memo said. The denials by the career employees were overturned, she said, by officials with more seniority who, by her account, did not follow the normal procedures meant to mitigate security risks and generally adhered to by other administrations.”
Which, when you put it that way, seems kinda bad, especially since among the 25 are two current senior White House officials (spoiler: one of them is Jared) as well as contractors and other employees working for the office of the president.
But never fear, say the Republicans on the oversight committee. “In a nine-page memo of their own, Republicans presented Ms. Newbold’s concerns about the office’s leadership as overblown and, in some cases, typical of a disgruntled federal employee,” recounts the Times. “They said she had told the committee that ‘only’ three of the 25 individuals on her list were ‘senior-level’ White House employees, and ‘only’ four or five prompted ‘very serious reasons.’”
Whew. That certainly makes us feel better.
Yet it seems like not everybody feels that way. In fact, in USA Today, Kurt Bardella, a Republican-turned-Democrat who once worked for Rep. Darrell Issa, offers an assessment of the story that’s a downright downer:
Every single person who lives in this country and claims to care about our national security should be terrified by the idea that people who are trusted with our nation’s most sensitive secrets were initially rejected to receive a security clearance. This concern with keeping our secrets safe was one of the primary justifications for the House Republicans’ prolonged multiyear investigation of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s private email server and the creation of the Benghazi Select Committee.
As someone who spent five years working for Republicans on the House Oversight Committee during the Obama presidency, I can tell you that what Trump has done with these security clearances is a far bigger scandal than “Hillary’s emails,” Benghazi, Fast & Furious, IRS “targeting” of conservative groups or any of the other so-called scandals Republicans obsessed over under the guise of transparency and security.
When you consider the many details about the Trump family finances and entanglements that have been kept secret from the American people, the potential for conflicts of interest is extremely troubling and dangerous. There are legitimate questions about what people are doing with state secrets and why. Are some of them putting their financial interests ahead of our national security? What is the motivation behind the president’s decision to overrule his own security and intelligence experts?
This is why the Cummings investigation is so important. It’s not just that 25 or so people received clearances who probably shouldn’t have. We need to know why their clearances were denied or rejected.
Chasing Amy, the “heartland economics” edition: “Grit.” “Heart.” “Unglitzy.” Yes, these are the sort of cliches traditionally used to describe backup infielders or literally anyone from Detroit. But this week they’re buzzwords from the latest media profiles of hometown Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who continues to sharpen her presidential pitch as a no-nonsense midwesterner who understands the needs of the “heartland.”
The Washington Post followed Klobuchar through Iowa to focus on the centerpiece of that pitch, her new trillion-dollar infrastructure plan. From Pacific Junction, Klobuchar heard from a family who lost everything to Missouri River flooding after a levee failure. “The infrastructure plan seemed aimed squarely at waterlogged Iowans, who saw 57 of their state’s 99 counties flooded last month and who are crucial to Klobuchar’s attempt to win the Democratic presidential nomination,” wrote Post reporter Cleve R. Wootson Jr.
Over in The Atlantic, Edward-Isaac Dovere sat down with Klobuchar to delve into what exactly her “heartland economics” concept means, and whether it’s sound strategy or a swipe at misplaced nostalgia. Klobuchar told him the phrase means, in part, a “focus on rural economics,” from infrastructure to broadband and clean drinking water. Those efforts, Klobuchar maintains, are key to winning rural voters that Trump used to pick up states like Wisconsin, Michigan and Iowa in 2016. Dovere pointed out that cities and suburbs sent Tony Evers to the governor’s mansion in Wisconsin last year, and in 2016, Hillary Clinton got 75,000 fewer votes in Detroit’s county than Barack Obama and lost Michigan by 10,704.
Regardless, the week can only be seen as a positive for Klobuchar, who spent more time talking about her ideas and less time defending her record as Hennepin County Prosecutor or her pitching arm. (Klobuchar also released 12 years of tax returns, which did not appear to yield anything particularly notable.)
Elsewhere in the 2020 fray, it was not such a good week for presumptive front-runner Joe Biden, who vowed to better respect the personal space of women after seven women said he had touched them in ways that made them uncomfortable. “Social norms have begun to change,” he said in a video on Twitter. Debate has ensued over whether the statement was an adequate apology.
Meanwhile, Sen. Elizabeth Warren continues to employ the odd strategy of talking about policies, and this week it was all about a bill that would make it easier to ferry corporate executives off to jail when their companies break the law. Also: Sen. Kamala Harris said she wants immigrant Dreamers to work in Congress, and Mayor Pete talked about Scripture and grace.

“Planet Fox: How Rupert Murdoch’s Empire of Influence Remade the World”
As we’ve long said around Memo HQ, the media finds nothing more fascinating than the media itself. And there is no media organization in the world more fascinating than that of Fox News, which explains not only the buzz over this story, but also its Ulyssian length. The New York Times devotes three reporters and three parts to telling the dynastic drama facing Rupert Murdoch’s empire, assuming that the man himself will, you know, actually die one day:
Over the last six months, we have spoken to more than 150 people across three continents about the Murdochs and their empire — some who know the family intimately, some who have helped them achieve their aims, some who have fought against them with varying degrees of success. (Most of these people insisted on anonymity to share intimate details about the family and its business so as not to risk retribution.) The media tend to pay a lot of attention to the media: Fox News is covered almost as closely as the White House and often in the same story. The Murdochs themselves are an enduring object of cultural fascination: “Ink,” a play about Rupert’s rise, is opening soon on Broadway. The second season of HBO’s “Succession,” whose fictional media family, the Roys, bears a striking resemblance to the Murdochs, airs this summer. But what we as reporters had not fully appreciated until now is the extent to which these two stories — one of an illiberal, right-wing reaction sweeping the globe, the other of a dynastic media family — are really one. To see Fox News as an arm of the Trump White House risks missing the larger picture. It may be more accurate to say that the White House — just like the prime ministers’ offices in Britain and Australia — is just one tool among many that this family uses to exert influence over world events.

Texto completo: A Lake County man who gained notoriety for his dark fixation on whether the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary actually happened - or was the result of a nefarious conspiracy - has been thrust into the national spotlight as he is named in several defamation lawsuits filed by the victims' families.
According to a deposition and court records released last week from one of the lawsuits, right-wing radio host Alex Jones said he was fed conspiracy theories - including through more than 4,000 emails over several years - by Wolfgang Halbig of Sorrento that the killings in Newtown, Conn., may have been staged by the government as a way of bringing forth more gun-control laws.
Halbig's obsession about the massacre that left 20 first-graders and six adults dead has been the subject of stories in recent days by The New York Times, Washington Post and other publications. He also is mentioned in an NPR radio show last month about "the upside-down world where conspiracy theorists dwell."
"I can't tell whether they died or they did not," Halbig told the Orlando Sentinel this week. "But for six years I have made public records requests to prove whether this happened or not. And they have refused to give me those documents ... I wanted, for once and for all, to know whether Sandy Hook happened."
Jones even invited Halbig, 72, several times to be a guest on his radio and online show "Infowars" to talk about the "supposed tragedy" on Dec. 14, 2012.
For Jones, Halbig was a source of fodder for his hard-edged program that spouts bizarre conspiracy theories across the Internet. For Halbig, Jones provided him with a national stage to talk about his preoccupation with Sandy Hook.
Halbig, a former Lake County school district risk manager who made an unsuccessful run for a Lake County Commission seat in 2010, said this week that his curiosity about the mass shooting was sparked two months after the tragedy while attending a Florida School Boards Association safety conference in Tampa, where there was discussion about the Sandy Hook incident.
Convinced that authorities and witnesses lied about the shooting, he started demanding scores of public records from Connecticut authorities including photos of the children's bodies, police logs, a list of all the people who entered the crime scene, and even receipts for the purchase of materials to clean from the classrooms the "bodily fluids, brain matter, skull fragments and around 45-60 gallons of blood," according to a recent New York Times story.
Halbig said he has traveled to Newtown at least two dozen times for "my research," spending at least $1,800 per trip. He has also traveled around the country with an "Infowars" camera crew in tow to approach family members of the victims and prod them for details and proof of their children's deaths.
Halbig said he doesn't understand why he's being vilified and insisted he's not trying to cause the victims' families pain.
"Why am I being attacked for Sandy Hook?" Halbig asked. "I'm trying to get answers ... And if you prove me wrong, then I will apologize profusely and I will check myself into a mental hospital."
Halbig, who is married to a retired Lake County schoolteacher and has two adult sons, said his family has told him to drop the issue and move on.
"'Just leave it alone.' That's what they told me," he said.
The deposition detailing Jones' association with Halbig was released days after Jeremy Richman, the father of 6-year-old Sandy Hook victim Avielle Richman, killed himself March 25.
The deposition and other court records are part of a defamation lawsuit brought against Jones in Texas by Scarlett Lewis. Lewis' son, Jessie Lewis, also 6, was killed at Sandy Hook while helping other children escape.
It is among four lawsuits families of nine victims of the school shooting have filed against Jones and "Infowars." Three of those suits have been brought in Texas. The other was filed in Connecticut by eight victims and a first responder.
Jones testified that Halbig and others were sources of information about the shooting. Jones said he especially singled out Halbig as a source for Sandy Hook because of his professional background working for public schools.
In the 1980s, Halbig coached girls soccer and volleyball teams at Lake Brantley High School. He later was named an assistant principal at Lyman High School and then principal of Excel, a public alternative school for disruptive students. He then became security director for Seminole County schools in the mid-1990s.
"He seemed very credible and put-together earlier on," Jones testified in the deposition. "But I can't remember the exact number; he seemed to get agitated about four years, three years ago."
Jones also acknowledged in the deposition that everything Halbig has told him about Sandy Hook isn't accurate.
As Halbig's interest in the mass shooting grew, Lake County deputies were called to his home in the gated RedTail community several times over the years.
In 2013, Halbig claimed he was being "cyber stalked" on the internet, threatened physically and that law-enforcement officers in plain clothes came to his home to demand that he stop inquiring about the Sandy Hook shooting, according to incident reports provided by the Lake County Sheriff's Office.
In 2015, he called deputies several times to report that he was again being cyberstalked and that he was poisoned after arriving home from Newtown. He added that he found a green and white rubber duck in his mailbox and believed the toy was "treated with a toxic substance," according to sheriff's report. Halbig also said his family was receiving anonymous packages in the mail, reports said. A year later, Halbig turned over to deputies several more rubber ducks that he had received in the mail, according to reports. Then in June 2016, Halbig called deputies to his home and said "he believed unknown persons to be impersonating Ivanka Trump or her assistant and believes Donald Trump to be in danger from some conspiracy."
Jones wasn't the only one who apparently took note of Halbig.
According to the HuffPost website, Mark Richardson, an NRA training coordinator and gun-range safety officer in Fairfax, Va., sent Halbig an email Feb. 15, 2018, the day after a gunman opened fire at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, killing 17 students and staff members.
Richardson presented the idea that the gunman didn't act alone as authorities have said. Rather, he asked Halbig how was the gunman able to gain entry into the school?
"Concerning what happened in Florida yesterday, I have been asking the question and no one else seems to be asking it," Richardson wrote in the email. "To pull the fire alarm, he [the shooter] had to already be inside. Correct? ... When my Children were in school the only way into the school was through the front door and past the main office."
Leonard Pozner, whose son Noah, 6, died at Sandy Hook Elementary, filed a lawsuit against Halbig in Lake County in 2015 and succeeded in his request for an injunction against Halbig requiring him to remove Pozner's address, phone number and email address from his website. Halbig's website also asked visitors to contribute money to help him find the truth about the Sandy Hook shooting.
Pozner, who is featured in the radio program about conspiracy theories on NPR's "This American Life," added that he and other victims' families are regularly tormented by Sandy Hook conspiracy theorizers such as Halbig and Jones for years after the tragedy.
"They directly harass by creating web sites and blog posts defaming the victims and the victims' families, defacing photos and creating narratives designed to cause people distress," Pozner said in an email to the Sentinel. "In my case, some of his most recent blog posts claim that my son never existed, or is alive and well and living under an assumed name, and that the government paid me millions of dollars to be a 'crisis actor.'"

Texto completo: Members of special counsel Robert Mueller III's team have told associates they are frustrated with the limited information Attorney General William Barr has provided about their nearly two-year investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election and whether President Donald Trump sought to obstruct justice, according to people familiar with the matter.
The displeasure among some who worked on the closely held inquiry has quietly begun to surface in the days since Barr released a four-page letter to Congress on March 24 describing what he said were the principal conclusions of Mueller's still-confidential, 400-page report.
In his letter, Barr said that the special counsel did not establish a conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia. And he said that Mueller did not reach a conclusion "one way or the other" as to whether Trump's conduct in office constituted obstruction of justice.
Absent that, Barr told lawmakers that he concluded the evidence was not sufficient to prove that the president obstructed justice.
But members of Mueller's team have complained to close associates that the evidence they gathered on obstruction was alarming and significant.
"It was much more acute than Barr suggested," said one person, who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the subject's sensitivity.
The New York Times first reported that some special counsel investigators feel that Barr did not adequately portray their findings.
Some members of the office were particularly disappointed that Barr did not release summary information the special counsel team had prepared, according to two people familiar with their reactions.
"There was immediate displeasure from the team when they saw how the attorney general had characterized their work instead," according one U.S. official briefed on the matter.
Summaries were prepared for different sections of the report, with a view that they could made public, the official said.
The report was prepared "so that the front matter from each section could have been released immediately - or very quickly," the official said. "It was done in a way that minimum redactions, if any, would have been necessary, and the work would have spoken for itself."
Mueller's team assumed the information was going to be made available to the public, the official said, "and so they prepared their summaries to be shared in their own words - and not in the attorney general's summary of their work, as turned out to be the case."
A spokeswoman for the Justice Department declined to comment. A spokesman for the special counsel did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Attorneys for the president did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
In the wake of the limited information released by Barr, Trump declared that the Mueller report provided him with "complete and total exoneration." He has repeatedly called for an inquiry into how the investigation began in the first place.
"There was no collusion with Russia," Trump said. "There was no obstruction."
During nearly two years of work, Mueller's team - which included 19 lawyers and roughly 40 FBI agents, analysts and other professional staff - worked in near silence, speaking only rarely, through public documents filed in court. The fact that some have been confiding in recent days to associates is a sign of the level of their distress.
Some members of Mueller's team appear caught off guard by how effectively the president has used Barr's letter to claim total victory, as the limited information about their work has been weaponized in the country's highly polarized political environment, according to people familiar with their responses.
Their frustrations come as polls show many Americans have already drawn conclusions about the special counsel findings - even though only a handful of words from the report have so far been released.
On Wednesday night, Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, questioned why Barr did not release the special counsel's summary material.
"It's been my assumption that a 400-page report has an executive summary already, and so of course it begged the question, 'Why did Barr feel the need to release his own summary?' " he said on MSNBC. "Why didn't he release a summary produced by Bob Mueller itself instead of trying to shape it through his own words?"
It is not yet clear if Mueller's full investigative findings will be released publicly.
Barr told Congress in a letter last week that the principal conclusions he described were not meant to be a summary of Mueller's investigation. He said he is aiming to submit a redacted version of the report to Congress by mid-April after removing classified and grand jury material, as well damaging information about peripheral players who were not charged with crimes.
"Everyone will soon be able to read it on their own," Barr wrote.
The House Judiciary Committee voted on Wednesday to authorize a subpoena for the entire report, as well as investigative materials, though Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., said he will wait to issue the demand until he sees what Barr makes public. Some Democrats have also indicated they wish to see Mueller testify to Congress, which would allow lawmakers to question him about Barr's letter.
Barr said the special counsel's report is divided into two parts. The first pertains to the Russian effort to influence the 2016 election and documents crimes committed by Russians in that regard.
The second addresses a number of actions by the president as potentially raising concerns about obstruction of justice, Barr said.
He said that the special counsel's decision not to reach a legal conclusion on obstruction left it to him to determine whether Trump's conduct as described constituted a crime.
Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein "and I have concluded that the evidence developed ... is not sufficient to establish" that the president committed obstruction of justice, he wrote in his letter to Congress.
Democrats have questioned Barr's conclusion, noting that he wrote a 2018 memo that criticized Mueller's obstruction inquiry and argued that the president cannot be accused of obstruction for exercising his broad constitutional powers.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – The Justice Department on Thursday defended Attorney General William Barr's decision to release a bare-bones summary of the report prepared by special counsel Robert Mueller, suggesting the full document was so packed with secret grand jury information that revealing even portions of it immediately would have been impossible.
Spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said "every page" of Mueller's nearly 400-page report was marked with a written warning that it could contain protected grand jury information. Federal law generally prohibits the government from revealing that information.
The statement comes as Democratic lawmakers, unsatisfied that Mueller's report remains secret two weeks after he turned it in, are threatening Barr with subpoenas to force the document's disclosure. Key lawmakers said Thursday that they now expect to summon Mueller to testify before Congress about his investigation.
“We will obviously want to hear the testimony of the investigators,” House Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N. Y. , told reporters Thursday. “We will eventually want to hear the testimony of Mr. Mueller. ”
Nadler sent Barr a three-page letter Thursday asking for the public release "as soon as possible" of summaries that Mueller's team prepared as part of their report.
Mueller report: House panel authorizes subpoena for Robert Mueller's full report, setting up a fight with DOJ
Mueller: AG William Barr plans to release Mueller report by mid-April. 'Everyone will soon be able to read it. '
Last month, Barr informed Congress that Mueller's investigation had not found a conspiracy involving President Donald Trump's campaign and the Russian government to tip the 2016 election in Trump's favor. Because the special counsel did not resolve the issue of whether the president's actions amounted to obstruction, Barr independently determined that Trump's conduct did not constitute a crime.
The attorney general's intervention has since set off a politically-charged battle for access to the entire text of Mueller's report, the fruit of a 22-month investigation that has shadowed the Trump administration since its first days.
More: AG William Barr plans to deliver Mueller report to Congress and the public in 'weeks, not months'
More: Mueller report: House committee members fight over subpoena for full report
Friction between the Justice Department and Democratic lawmakers intensified late Wednesday when the New York Times and Washington Post reported that some of Mueller's investigators had told associates that Barr's description of their work understated the significance of their findings. USA TODAY has not verified those exchanges.
Barr has promised to release a more complete, though redacted, version of Mueller's report by mid-April.
"Given the extraordinary public interest in the matter, the attorney general decided to release the report’s bottom-line findings and his conclusions immediately — without attempting to summarize the report — with the understanding that the report itself would be released after the redaction process," Kupec said. She said Barr would not release the report piecemeal.
Unsatisfied, House Democrats said Thursday that they now want Mueller's public testimony in addition to Barr who is scheduled to appear before congressional committees in early May.
Lawmakers said an appearance by Mueller, who has not uttered a public word since his appointment as special counsel nearly two years ago, was now “inevitable. ”
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. , called for the release of the entire report to Congress. “Just release the Mueller report,” Pelosi told reporters Thursday. “If they don’t have anything to hide, they shouldn’t worry. ”
Pelosi said lawmakers want to review the evidence that Mueller gathered.
“Let me just say: The Mueller report will be released,” Pelosi said. “To us, it is inevitable. To them, it is inconceivable. We have to shorten the distance between the inevitable and the inconceivable. ”
The House Judiciary Committee voted Wednesday to authorize subpoenas for the full Mueller report and its underlying evidence. Nadler has said he would negotiate with Barr for release of the report before issuing the subpoena is short order.
“I think it’s inevitable that Mueller is going to testify at some point, but the first thing we need is the release of the report and the documents,” Nadler said.
House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif. , questioned why Barr issued his own summary of the report two days after it was submitted, rather than releasing summaries that Mueller’s team provided.
“Those summaries may be among the most carefully drafted worded parts of the entire report by the Mueller team,” Schiff told CNN on Thursday. "We are two weeks into this, all we have is Bill Barr's word for this. ”
Trump, who has claimed "complete exoneration" based on Mueller's findings, dismissed reports of disagreements between Justice and some on the special counsel's team.

Five potential impacts if President Trump closed the U.S.-Mexico border

Texto completo: In response to a surge of Central American migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border, President Donald Trump is threatening to close the Southern border unless Mexico stops the record number of asylum-seekers. Across the country, experts and interest groups opposed to a border shutdown have been weighing in about how that could affect people on both sides of the border.
Shutting down the border could actually increase illegal border crossings. Nearly half a million immigrants cross the border legally every day, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Many of them commute from northern Mexican cities to work in the U.S. and could find themselves unemployed if they couldn’t cross the border.
“If anything, it would promote more poverty in Mexico, which would then turn into more pressure on immigration in the U.S.,” Gary Hufbauer, a nonresident senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, told The New York Times.
Hundreds of students in border schools and universities wouldn’t be able to get to class — or home. Administrators of El Paso’s Father Yermo Catholic School, which serves 190 students, say nearly 40% of their students cross the border every day and could fall behind if the border closed, according to El Paso TV station ABC 7.
ABC 7 also reports the El Paso school district has begun preparing to care for students if their parents are unable to pick them up because of a border shutdown. Officials at the University of Texas at El Paso told ABC 7 they have launched a website and plan to help the 900 students who cross the border to attend classes.
Border communities and Texans would take an economic hit. Brownsville, McAllen, Laredo, El Paso and San Diego would feel the biggest impact from halted trade if goods can’t cross the border, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce said Monday.
Laredo handled more than 50% of U.S.-Mexico trade in 2017, and roughly 16,000 trucks and 1,400 rail cars pass through the city each day, according to the Laredo Chamber of Commerce.
Border businesses would lose customers in cities like McAllen, where Mexican shoppers account for nearly one-third of the city’s $3.2 billion retail sales. When the San Ysidro port of entry was shut down for five hours last November as a migrant caravan approached the border, San Diego retailers lost $5.3 million in sales, NPR reported.
The Texas Association of Business says 1 in 5 jobs in the state is dependent on trade. “If you want to create an economic crisis, then shutting down the border will create a financial crisis,” the association’s president, Jeff Moseley, said in a Monday statement.
The economic impacts would reach around the world. Vehicle production lines across the U.S. would be affected by a shutdown in less than a week, according to Ann Wilson, the senior vice president for government affairs at the Motor & Equipment Manufacturers Association. That’s because the U.S. auto industry sources 37% of its vehicle parts from Mexico, Kristin Dziczek, vice president of the Center for Automotive Research in Michigan, told NPR.
The production of apparel, TVs, computers and medical hardware would also be impacted since these industries manufacture their products just south of the border or source materials from Mexico, according to The New York Times.
If rail terminals and pipelines are included in the shutdown, the closure would prove costly to the energy sector since Mexico is the largest importer of U.S. diesel and gasoline.
American farmers would lose one of their biggest markets. If Mexico can’t import American soybeans, corn, dairy products, chickens, beef and other agricultural goods, American farmers would likely suffer.
Meanwhile, the U.S. relies on Mexico for 60% of its produce, according to the Fresh Produce Association of the Americas. So yes, Americans could run out of avocados, and they could also see big price increases for produce like bell peppers, squash, tomatoes, cucumbers, melons and eggplant.

Texto completo: Which of the two dozen or so Democratic presidential candidates is going to carry black voters next year?

The answer to that question is likely to be identical to the answer to the question, which candidate is going to be the Democratic nominee and maybe even the president?

For years, black Americans have cast about one out of four votes in Democratic primaries. In 2016, they cast 71% of Democratic primary votes in Mississippi; 61% in South Carolina; 54% in Alabama; 51% in Georgia; 46% in Maryland; 32% in North Carolina and Tennessee; and 20%-28% in Arkansas, Florida, Illinois, Virginia, New York, Michigan, Missouri, and Ohio.

Near-unanimous black support helped nominate and elect the last three Democratic presidents — Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama. Near-unanimous, because black primary voters have tended to vote with solidly for one candidate over another, even against alternatives with serious claims on their support.

Such solidarity in voting makes sense for people identifying as part of a distinct group suffering from discrimination. For years, political reporters have listened as black preachers, avoiding outright endorsements, called for “unity.” Their congregations understood what they meant.

Blacks have voted 85% or more Democratic in every presidential election since 1964. In primaries, they voted in similar numbers for Carter over Ted Kennedy in 1980, for Jesse Jackson in 1984 and 1988, for Obama over Hillary Clinton in 2008, and for Clinton over Bernie Sanders in 2016.

If the impulse toward solidarity prevails again in 2020, it’s not clear who will benefit. Joe Biden, after eight years as the faithful vice president to the nation’s first black president, leads among black voters in current polls. But will he run?

The two candidates with African ancestry, Kamala Harris and Cory Booker, have backgrounds atypical of descendants of antebellum American slaves. Harris’s father is from Jamaica and Booker grew up in an affluent, 1% black suburb in New Jersey. But then, Barack Obama’s background was even more atypical: How many Americans grew up in Indonesia?

Plus there are signs that black voters may not be behaving as monolithically as they used to. Exit polls in the 2016 Democratic presidential primaries showed them favoring Hillary Clinton pretty unanimously in the South, giving Bernie Sanders only 6%-19% in former Confederate states. But in New York, Pennsylvania, five Great Lakes states, and Missouri, Sanders got between 26% and 32%; he carried three of these and came within 2 points of carrying two more.

Chicago’s mayoral election is another example of waning black solidarity. Although Tuesday’s runoff was a contest between two black women, neither had carried the city’s 19 predominantly black wards in the nine-candidate Feb. 26 initial primary. Mayor-elect Lori Lightfoot’s electoral base was among whites in the upscale Lakefront wards, and her appeal was not race-connected, but based on her lack of entanglement with corruption-tinged insiders.

Interestingly, even on race-related issues, white college graduates, not blacks, are now the most liberal segment of the Democratic electorate. As New York Times blogger Thomas Edsall notes, more white liberals (79%) than blacks (60%) believe that racial discrimination is the main reason many blacks can’t get ahead. Fully 32% of blacks say that blacks who don’t succeed are “mostly responsible.”

Black voters are more religious than whites generally and much more than white liberals; they cast the deciding votes against same-sex marriage in California in 2008 and opposed it in North Carolina in 2012, changing their minds only after Barack Obama endorsed it. Indeed, blacks make up a large share of the diminishing number of Democratic primary voters labeling themselves as moderate or conservative.

Black Democrats seem less likely than white college graduate liberals to support, and to identify as litmus tests, positions unpopular with most general election voters, such open-borders immigration, ninth-month abortions, and the Green New Deal. Perhaps they will prevent “woke” white college graduates — and a press almost entirely made up of that demographic — from pulling the party too far to the left to defeat a Republican incumbent whose job approval seems stuck around 45 percent.

Or perhaps not. The Democratic party, from its Jacksonian foundation in 1832, has always been a coalition of out-groups, of people who are not considered typical Americans but who, taken together, make up a majority or a near-majority. At their best they’re a triumphant majority, at their worst a disorderly rabble.

Which will they be in 2020? Black voters will have a big say in that.

Elon Musk’s compensation at least 40,000 times more than median Tesla worker

Texto completo: Elon Musk has come under recent scrutiny from the SEC for some ill-advised tweets, from shareholders about closing stores, and even paparazzis for his relationship to indie musician Grimes.
Those blows were probably softened by his $2.28 billion compensation last fiscal year from Tesla. That means his compensation is 40,668 times more than the median Tesla worker’s, which is about $56,200, according to Bloomberg.
Tesla has about 48,800 employees, the news outlet reported. The majority of Musk’s total compensation, which would be paid out over 10 years, is in stock options contingent on Tesla hitting several targets for revenue, market value and more, Bloomberg said.
So far, the company has met two of the 16 goals, according to that news organization. Tesla is required to pay Musk at least minimum wage, about $37,000 a year, but he told the New York Times he doesn’t cash the checks and therefore does not receive an annual salary.
Tesla had the largest CEO-to-median worker compensation ratio among public companies in the data analyzed by Bloomberg. However, Musk’s realized compensation last year was $56,380, which would make the CEO to median worker ratio 1-to-1, according to documents Tesla filed with the SEC.
In addition to salaries and stock options, CEO compensation can include bonuses and even additional costs incurred by companies on their bosses’ behalves.
For example, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg had a salary of just $1 but a total compensation of $8.85 million in fiscal year 2017. That includes $7.3 million for Zuckerberg’s personal security at his Palo Alto home, as well as when he’s traveling, plus $1.5 million for his use of a private airplane, according to a 2018 proxy statement.
Facebook employees had a median compensation of $240,430, so Zuckerberg had a 37-to-1 ratio. That’s far smaller than the median CEO to employee ratio of 137-to-1, according to Bloomberg. Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook’s COO, had total compensation of about $25.2 million in fiscal year 2017, mostly in stock awards, according to the proxy statement.
Twitter’s median employee compensation was lower, $161,860, but their CEO, Jack Dorsey, didn’t take a salary. Dorsey was paid $2.75 by Square, the payment processing company he also runs. Square employees have a median compensation of about $152,300.
Likewise, Alphabet — the company formerly known as Google — paid its CEO Larry Page $1 in fiscal year 2017, the most recent data available from Bloomberg. The median Alphabet employee earned almost $197,300.
Salesforce’s billionaire CEO Marc Benioff had $4.65 million in compensation, and his median employee earned about $155,300 — a 30-to-1 ratio. Apple CEO Tim Cook’s compensation was $15.68 million, a 238-to-1 ratio to the tech giant’s median employee, who earned about $55,400.

Texto completo: A beefless, 100% plant-based Whopper is coming to Burger King.
The burger chain is testing the "Impossible Whopper" -- with patties from plant-based food company Impossible Foods -- at all 52 locations in St. Louis starting Monday.
The new Whopper consists of the flame-grilled, plant-based patty topped the usual tomatoes, lettuce, mayonnaise, ketchup, pickles, and onions on a toasted sesame seed bun.
The chain hopes to roll out the beefless sandwich to all 7,200 locations nationwide after the test-run in St. Louis.
Red Robin -- with locations in Western Pa. -- also recently announced that they would be offering the Impossible Burger at all their locations starting Monday.
Vegetarian burgers are offered at Carl's Jr. and White Castle restaurants, but adding the option to all BK restaurants would make the plant-based burger option much more widely available.
Fernando Machado, Burger King's chief marketing officer, said to The New York Times that customers and employees had not been able to tell the difference between the meat Whopper and the plant-based one.
"People on my team who know the Whopper inside and out, they try it and they struggle to differentiate which one is which," Mr. Machado said.
Burger King posted a video demonstrating this sentiment showing customers eating the Whoppers with the vegan patty and their reactions to it. They couldn't believe it, according to the video.

Impossible Foods was founded in 2011 by Pat Brown, a former Stanford University professor. According to CNN Business the company is rolling out a new recipe for BK that is designed to look and taste even more like meat.

Texto completo: Ruth Reichl helmed Gourmet during the last golden age of print magazines. As editor-in-chief from 1999 until 2009, she presided over the country's epicurean publication of note, wrapped in the gilded gauze of Condé Nast: There were drivers, lavish parties, clothing allowances, offices the size of penthouse apartments and decorating budgets to match. It was all a bit foreign to Reichl, who came of age cooking at a collective in Berkeley, Calif., and was later the most famous anonymous woman in New York as food critic of The New York Times. Make no mistake: Ruth Reichl is not Anna Wintour.
But when she left the Times for the Condé cocoon, she was able to push the envelope of food journalism, transforming Gourmet from safe and stuffy to daring and bold, challenging readers with provocative covers and envelope-pushing essays by the likes of the late David Foster Wallace (who memorably wrote about whether boiling lobsters feel pain). She was also able to eke out more time with her son, Nick, than she ever was while reviewing restaurants every night.
Then it all came tumbling down. The magazine folded with little notice; Reichl and her more than 60 employees were suddenly left without jobs. Reichl should have been used to transition, and surely she would rise again: In her long career, she was editor and food critic for the Los Angeles Times, food critic for The New York Times, and wrote several acclaimed books chronicling those adventures. But this stung: She revered the magazine — had since she was a little girl, growing up in Greenwich Village with an eccentric mother who fancied herself a gourmand but was often undercut by bipolar disorder, swinging from grand cooking and shopping sprees to a bedroom retreat.
“Save Me the Plums" is Reichl's account of those halcyon times at Condé Nast before the ax fell. Readers are introduced to characters fit for fiction, from the garlic-loathing publishing mogul Si Newhouse (“small, wizened, and dressed in an olive-drab sweatshirt") to Vanity Fair editor Graydon Carter (“a superbly self-satisfied lion"). But this book isn't about the vipers and sages who decorated Condé Nast's rarified orbit; it's a study in magazine-making, earnest ambition, disappointment, and reinvention. It's also supremely readable: All of Reichl's books exude the sense that she's gathering up the reader in her pocket and taking them along for the ride. There is no arm's-length distance here.
Q. How did you envision your time at Gourmet ending? Had it not ended as it did, do you think you could've stayed there for life?
A. I knew I would get fired at some point. I always thought, “I'm just a visitor in this strange and wonderful land, and eventually I will get fired." So, I never envisioned that I would be there for the rest of my life. I did not envision it ending the way it did.
Q. You wrote about your son, Nick, who at that point had grown older. You're looking back, and you wrote something like, “If I had to do it all over again, I might have managed my time differently." What would you have done differently, and how did you balance spending time with him? What did that look like for you?
A. I would have spent more time with him. I just would. Nick is 30 now, and when you first have kids, you think it's the rest of your life. It's so all-encompassing. It doesn't occur to you that in the span of your life it's a blink of an eye . . . There's only about 15 years when they really want to spend a lot of time with you.
Q. I think you wrote, “Children need you around to be able to ignore you."
A. Well, they do. They do. And I just wish that I traveled less, that I had said “no" to more business dinners. Not that I wouldn't have spent every day in the magazine. I would have. But there are women who just leave at five o'clock, and everybody knows that that's what they're going to do, or six o'clock, or whatever. And I would be that person if I had to do it over again.
Q. Your mother plays a role in this book as well. Was there guilt, because in many ways you were living the life that she probably would have longed for?
A. Yes. Yes, I was living the life she would have loved. I don't feel guilty about that. First of all, she was mentally ill. So, she is not me. But I just feel enormously sorry for not only for her, but for the women of her generation who had so few choices. They really did. . . . I think your generation, having been brought up by women who had choices, have a better sense of how to balance it. I think for my generation, having looked at our mothers, I think we went so eagerly to the work side. And I think that for the generation after ours, having seen what it's like to be able to have a career and have motherhood, I think you probably have a better sense of balance.
Q. In that vein, how do you know that a transition is right? Managing a staff of that many people is a lot to carry on one's shoulders.
A. You never know. As a friend of mine said . . . When I was contemplating the Gourmet job and I said, “The time's not right. Maybe a year from now," and [she] said to me, “Ruth, it's never right. You have to take it when it comes."
Q. You had such reverence for Gourmet, especially the old Gourmet — not the one that you were stepping into, maybe, but the one of your childhood. Are there any current publications now that excite you the way Gourmet once did?
A. There are, and they're not all food publications. But among the food publications, I love Cherry Bombe, and I loved what Peter Meehan was doing with Lucky Peach . . . and I'm thrilled with the way mainstream publications are embracing food in new ways. The New Yorker, which did almost nothing on food now, regularly does food. And The Atlantic is doing regular food stuff. And I'm thrilled with the evolution of Eater. Who would have imagined that they would be doing interesting long-form essays and taking moral stands and getting really good writers? And online, Taste does a really good job. And you can go on and on and on. There's an awful lot of great stuff going on out there.
Q. There are people who cannot afford to be journalists in this day and age, but perhaps love to write about food but can't afford to take an unpaid internship or to get their foot in the door in some of the more traditional ways. What would you say to them?
A. OK. I actually don't weigh in about this very often, but I was living in a commune in Berkeley. We had no money . . . and we never went out to eat. We couldn't afford to go out to eat. But there was a throwaway paper called the East Bay Review of the Performing Arts, and I went to them and said, “Let me write restaurant reviews." And I wrote about little dives that I could afford to go to. I didn't write about any place that was fancy. But I wrote them for free, and I paid for the food myself. I would go once, and they weren't reviews exactly. They were just “I went here, and I like this."
I have an assistant who has very little money, works in a restaurant, and works part-time for me. But he writes about very cheap places in San Francisco. You can do it if you want to get clips. You can do it. You have to figure out ways to make your voice heard.
Q. Could you talk a bit about personal branding? When you were working at Gourmet, perhaps it got to be too much — the brand began to overtake Ruth the person. Do you think that in the world of chefs and in the world of food journalists, it's too easy to get caught up in branding? Do you see that as becoming more of a problem?
A. I have to say, the first time someone said, “You've got to become personal brand," I didn't know. I never heard of it before. It was so foreign to me. People aren't brands, and I do think people spend . . . I spend too much time doing Instagram and Twitter.
Q. You're a natural at Twitter.
A. And Twitter is fun. I didn't start that as a branding thing, but I just got on to Instagram and am doing it because you're supposed to. And I think that it's partly because we're still in the infancy of this media revolution. I think it will probably go away, and the truth is when push comes to shove, nothing can compete with the moving image and television, movies. People will start to do videos of themselves on Instagram. But ultimately that is the most compelling medium.
Q. For readers who might be going through a transition from a job in any industry: When suddenly the rug is pulled out from under you, how do you cope with that loss of professional identity? . . . Did you just go home and stare at the walls and think, “Who am I now?"
A. It wasn't a crisis of identity. It was a crisis of guilt. I felt really guilty that 65 people I really cared about lost their jobs. And I spent a long time thinking, “What could I have done to prevent this? Why didn't I see it coming?" I think you have to be as kind as you can to yourself in those moments and understand that you really have to go through a grieving process, and it is a grieving process. Those are the moments when you're incredibly grateful for your friends and your family. The idea that my four best friends from LA came out to be with me, it was huge for me that that happened. That they just showed up and said, “I'm helping you pack your office. You shouldn't do this by yourself," and then just gathered around me. And I think you need to do that. I think you need to let your friends and your family remind you that you're fine. You know that they still love you, and you will get through it.
Q. Some of the characters in the book almost read like fiction, even though they're not.
A. That was the great thing about Condé Nast. They were not bean counters. The company was helmed by Si Newhouse and James Truman and Steve Florio. You will never find three more colorful characters.
Q. Graydon Carter really does look like a lion.
A. It's really funny, because I didn't even realize that I did this, but my agent said, “You do realize that you characterize everyone as an animal?" And then I went through it and I realized, “Oh, my God. I really do that."

Texto completo: White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney said Sunday that he could guarantee Americans would not lose health coverage if the Affordable Care Act is struck down in a court challenge.
Apparently, MAGA means unaffordable health care
By Frederick Isasi
At a time when one in four Americans are forgoing needed health care because they simply can't afford to see their doctor or buy their prescription drugs, the Trump administration is making the situation worse.
It is waging war on some of our country's most vulnerable people — children, the terminally ill, people with disabilities and the elderly — by urging the complete judicial repeal of the Affordable Care Act. Such an action would leave millions of families without health care coverage, their health care costs would increase exponentially, and our nation would erase hard-won protections for people with pre-existing conditions.
Is this what making America great again looks like? Having people choose between paying rent or buying critical medication that keeps them alive? Apparently, to the Trump administration, it does.
Talker: What will life be like for Trump, Democrats in post-Mueller report world?
Ask your friends and family to sign-up for the Today's Talker newsletter
Beyond supporting judicial activism to repeal the ACA, President Donald Trump's administration has authorized multiple forms of junk insurance coverage that can discriminate against people with pre-existing conditions, deny essential health benefits like life-saving prescription drugs, refuse to cover catastrophic medical costs, and destabilize the consumer-protected market by luring young and healthy adults out of that market.
In sharp contrast to this, we see action from Congress to support meaningful coverage and financial security for our nation's families. For example, Democratic House chairs have introduced the Protecting Americans with Pre-existing Conditions Act, which repeals policies that permit the broad operation of the president’s junk health insurance policies.
Let's be clear, people's lives and the future of our nation’s families hang in the balance. Take, for example, the Eilers family in California. Nine-year-old Myka was born with an undiagnosed heart defect and, as a result, will forever be labeled as having a pre-existing condition. She spent the first few weeks of her life in the neonatal intensive care unit and had two open heart surgeries before her first birthday. At some point, she will require a heart valve replacement. Without the ACA and the protections it offers for individuals with pre-existing conditions, the Eilers worry that Myka will be unable to secure coverage for her heart, or that she will be subject to the return of lifetime caps.
We live in one of the wealthiest nations in the world. We spend twice as much on health care than other high-income nations on health care. The Eilers and all in our nation deserve the ability to receive the health care they need to live to their greatest potential. It is one of the most important measures of our society, and it's what making America great truly looks like.
Frederick Isasi is the executive director of Families USA. You can follow him on Twitter: @FrederickIsasi.
What others are saying
Nicholas Bagley, The New York Times: "The Trump administration has signaled loud and clear that its campaign against Obamacare is not over, that it will stop at nothing to achieve in court what it could not achieve in Congress, and that it doesn’t care how many people are hurt if the Affordable Care Act is undone. It has also put health care back at the center of the political conversation. Republicans already took a beating on the issue in the fall midterm elections, and Democrats, who released a bill in the House to strengthen the Affordable Care Act, want to keep running on it. They’ll be sure to remind voters of the Trump administration’s zealous commitment to taking away their health care. "
Alexandra Petri, The Washington Post: "The GOP is the party of health care! The Justice Department is asking an appeals court to invalidate the entire ACA, but don't worry, the GOP is going to be 'the Party of Great HealthCare,' and it is going to replace what currently exists (a health care system) with something even better: the void; oblivion; the rush of wings of an enormous eagle departing, never to return!"
Robert Henneke and Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, FoxNews. com: "First, President Donald Trump is recommitting our nation to health care freedom and to removing the constraints placed on market forces. Second, he is putting the force of the Department of Justice behind the very legitimate constitutional issue originally raised. . . . Instead of letting fear and tepidity rule the day, we should embrace the opportunity to present a third way for health care in America, a way past the current broken regulated 'managed' care system — made worse by Obamacare — and the top-down, budget-busting 'Medicare for All. ' "
What our readers are saying
If Republicans have a great health care plan — better than what we have with the Affordable Care Act — why don't they present it in Congress? The answer is easy: They simply do not have a plan.
— Ed Wilts
Translation on Mick Mulvaney's guarantee that no one would lose their coverage even if the ACA were to be struck down: We're going to say whatever we need to say so we can repeal Obamacare and replace it with Trumpcare, which will be the exact same thing only with a different name that Republicans will unanimously love simply because it has Trump's name on it.
— Austin Williams
Mulvaney's point is probably that insurance will still be available, but you may no longer be able to afford it — and that is your problem.
— Joseph Breckenridge
Coverage is not really the issue. What is covered and the costs are the issue. We need an affordable national health insurance that guarantees care for all, just like some of the other high-income countries.
— Patricia Tally

Conor McGregor tries to pick a Twitter fight with Mark Wahlberg

Texto completo: Conor McGregor announced his retirement on Twitter last week, but the former UFC champ is still looking to pick a fight.
“I've decided to challenge Hollywood actress Mark Walhberg [sic] next," McGregor tweeted Saturday night, whiffing on both the actor's name and gender. “A fight for all the shares!"
Why McGregor, who, according to The New York Times, is under investigation in Ireland for alleged sexual assault, chose to challenge Wahlberg is unclear. But the “shares" he mentioned seem to refer to Mark Wahlberg 's partial ownership stake in the Ultimate Fighting Championship empire.
Back in 2016, Wahlberg told TMZ he might be willing to sell the mixed martial arts fighter a piece of his stake if McGregor “cut the check." But by June 2018, Wahlberg told TMZ Sports there was no deal on the table.
“I need my piece" of the UFC, Marky Mark said, before sliding into his white Rolls Royce.
As of Monday afternoon, Wahlberg had yet to respond to McGregor's tweet.
One Twitter user advised McGregor to watch the 2005 film “Four Brothers" — in which Wahlberg plays a vengeful son — and take back the challenge.
“I'll smack him and his 4 brothers around," McGregor replied. “It wouldn't be the first crew of brothers i've smacked around. Check the history books. The UFC history books." JENNI TODD

Longing for an internet cleanse

Texto completo: The two most recent times I saw my friend Makoto Fujimura, he put a Kintsugi bowl in my hands. These ceramic bowls were 300 to 400 years old. But what made them special was that somewhere along the way they had broken into shards and were glued back together with a 15th-century technique using Japanese lacquer and gold.
They look like they have golden veins running through them, making them more beautiful and more valuable than they were in their original condition.
There's a dimension of depth to them. You sense the original life they had, the rupture and then the way they were so beautifully healed. And of course they stand as a metaphor for the people, families and societies we all know who have endured their own ruptures and come back beautiful, vulnerable and whole in their broken places.
I don't know about you, but I feel a great hunger right now for timeless pieces like these. The internet has accelerated our experience of time, and Donald Trump has upped the pace of events to permanent frenetic.
There is a rapid, dirty river of information coursing through us all day. If you're in the news business, or a consumer of the news business, your reaction to events has to be instant or it is outdated. If you're on social media, there are these swarming mobs who rise out of nowhere, leave people broken and do not stick around to perform the patient Kintsugi act of gluing them back together.
Probably like you, I've felt a great need to take a break from this pace every once in a while and step into a slower dimension of time. Mako's paintings are very good for these moments.
He was born in Boston to a Japanese family and studied art back in Japan. His paintings are gorgeous works of abstract expressionism, using a Japanese style called Nihonga. He grinds colored minerals like malachite and azurite into fine particles and then layers them on paper. Each layer takes time to dry, and Mako may use 60 layers in a single work.
Nihonga is slow to make and slow to see. Mako once advised me to stare at one of his paintings for 10 to 12 minutes. I thought it would be boring, but it was astonishing. As I stood still in front of it, my eyes adjusted to the work. What had seemed like a plain blue field now looked like a galaxy of color.
"A beautiful thing, though simple in its immediate presence," critic Frederick Turner once wrote, "always gives us a sense of depth below depth, almost an innocent wild vertigo as one falls through its levels."
The Greeks had a concept of Kairos time, which is not quantitative like our normal conception of time but qualitative - rich or empty, the meaningful hour or the hurried moment. When you're with beauty, in art or in nature, you tend to move at Kairos time - slowly, serenely but thickly.
The great philosopher of time is Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel. In his great book "The Sabbath," he points out that the first sacred thing in the Bible is not a thing, it is a time period, the seventh day. Judaism, he argues, is primarily a religion of time, not space.
"The seventh day," he writes, "is a palace in time which we build. It is made of soul, of joy and reticence. In its atmosphere, a discipline is a reminder of adjacency to eternity. Indeed, the splendor of the day is expressed in terms of abstentions."
The Sabbath, he continues, is not a rest from the six other days. It is the peak experience the six other days point toward. On this day the Orthodox do less, and in slowness can glimpse the seeds of eternity.
Sabbath, Heschel concludes, "is endowed with a felicity which enraptures the soul, which glides into our thoughts with a healing sympathy. It is a day on which hours do not oust one another. It is a day that can soothe all sadness away. No one, even the unlearned, crude man, can remain insensitive to its beauty."
Mako has the sorts of thoughts one has when you live at a different pace. He is, he says, a border stalker.
He is Japanese but also American, a Christian and also a prominent figure in the art world. He is one of those people who live on the edges of groups and travel between groups, bringing news from outside.
There's an ambiguity, complexity and sometimes a hiddenness to his writing and speech that can't be expressed as a hot take.
He once wrote a book called "Culture Care." It is an argument against the whole idea of a culture war. It advocates an environmental movement for the culture - replacing the harsh works that flow from fear with works that are generous, generative and generational.
That last word is a breath from another age. What would it mean to live generationally once in a while, in a world that now finds the daily newspaper too slow?

Chess helped 8-year-old get family out of homelessness

Texto completo: Before he won the primary (K-3) championship section of the New York State Scholastic Championships earlier this month, 8-year-old Tanitoluwa Adewumi was living in a New York City homeless shelter with his family, who came to the United States from Nigeria as refugees.
But after The New York Times told the story of how Tanitoluwa - or "Tani," as he is called - went undefeated, despite only playing chess for about a year, the P.S. 116 third-grader catapulted to national fame.
Since then, thousands of people have collectively given more than $240,000 to a GoFundMe page that told the story of his family's plight. Someone gave the family an apartment rent-free for a year. And former President Bill Clinton invited Tani and his family to visit his Harlem office, tweeting to Tani: "You exemplify a winning spirit - in chess and in life."
Learning chess through the P.S. 116 chess program changed Tani's life.
The No. 1 feature for a chess program (or any program) must be safety. Even though a chess game is played oneon-one, there should never be one-on-one contact, out of the view of others, between a chess teacher and a child.
Beyond safety, look for a chess program that structures children's time. For example, an instructor introduces a chess concept. Then paired students practice that chess concept while the instructor monitors each student's progress. That cycle of teaching and practice repeats with another chess concept. Each class should also have free chess play, often toward the end after students have practiced the chess concepts.
But not every class period will have instruction, practice and free play. If your child likes to compete, look for a chess program that offers ladders or tournaments that enable students to see where they rank. Competitions can take place among the students within the chess program only or may additionally involve players from outside of the chess program. Competitions mean winning, losing and dealing with the emotions that accompany those results. Investigate how the chess program addresses the emotional side of chess.
If your child aspires to be a chess master, then he needs an instructor with chess expertise. The United States Chess Federation (US Chess) ratings and World Chess Federation ratings indicate knowledge of chess. For example, a chess expert (rated 2000-2199) is in the top 4 percent to 1.5 percent of players rated by US Chess. One of Tani's chess teachers, Shawn Martinez, is an expert with a US Chess rating of 2188.
When Elizabeth Spiegel won the 2019 Chess Educator of the Year Award from the University of Texas, she recommended that children have trial lessons with several different chess coaches. She also advised that parents sit in on each lesson and talk with their child afterward about which instructor works best for the child.
Chess programs vary. Some programs aim for children to socialize and play chess for fun. There may not be an emphasis on ratings or trophies. Other programs may promise that each child will gain a certain number of rating points in a specified time period. Parents should pick a program that seems to align with their goals and their children's goals.
After talking with other parents and children who are involved with the program, give it a try.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - The decision by New York state to ban single-use plastic bags from retail stores makes it a good time to revisit everyone's favorite environmental quandary: paper or plastic?
Unfortunately, there's no simple answer on whether paper or plastic bags are better for the environment. They both have downsides, but there are a few broad lessons to keep in mind when you are at the grocery store.
Plastic bags, which often take centuries to decompose, can create a dreadful waste problem even though they're far from the largest source of plastic waste in America - about 12 percent of the total.
On the other hand, paper bags typically require more energy and greenhouse gas emissions to produce, which isn't great from a global warming standpoint.
Reusable bags can be a decent compromise, provided you hold onto them and use them often. Ultimately, though, what you put inside the bag, particularly your food choices, will most likely matter a lot more for the environment than what type of bag you use.
The trouble with plastic bags is litter
American shoppers use more than 100 billion lightweight polyethylene plastic bags each year, and only a small portion are ever recycled. Most recycling centers can't deal with them - they just clog up the machinery - and so the majority of plastic bags end up in landfills, where they can take up to 1,000 years to degrade.
To be fair, a plastic bag doesn't cause too much harm sitting in a landfill. The bigger problem arises when people don't dispose of their bags properly, and the plastic ends up fluttering around in the wild, clogging up waterways and threatening wildlife.
San Jose, California, for instance, found that plastic bags made up about 12 percent of the litter in its creeks before implementing a local bag ban in 2012. And, just last week, a dead sperm whale washed ashore in Indonesia with two dozen plastic bags in its gut, along with other trash.
So, even though plastic bags are only a small fraction of America's overall plastic trash, they've become a highly visible sign of waste.
The trouble with paper bags: carbon emissions
So does that mean paper bags, which degrade more easily, are a better option? Not necessarily. Climate change has become the biggest environmental issue of our time, so it's worth looking at things from an emissions standpoint. And on that score, paper bags fare worse.
Even though paper bags are made from trees, which are, in theory, a renewable resource, it takes significantly more energy to create pulp and manufacture a paper bag than it does to make a single-use plastic bag from oil.
Back in 2011, Britain's Environment Agency conducted a life-cycle assessment of various bag options, looking at every step of the production process. The conclusion? You'd have to reuse a paper bag at least three times before its environmental impact equaled that of a high-density polyethylene plastic bag used only once. And if plastic bags were reused repeatedly, they looked even better.
Paper bags can more easily be recycled or even composted, but the British study found that even these actions didn't make a huge difference in the broader analysis. Unless you're reusing your paper bags a lot, they look like a poorer option from a global warming standpoint.
Reusable bags are a decent option - if you actually reuse them
That same British analysis also looked into reusable options, like heavier, more durable plastic bags or cotton bags. And it found that these are only sustainable options if you use them frequently.
Making a cotton shopping bag is hardly cost-free. Growing cotton requires a fair bit of energy, land, fertilizer and pesticides, which can have all sorts of environmental effects - from greenhouse gas emissions to nitrogen pollution in waterways.
The study found that an avid shopper would have to reuse his or her cotton bag 131 times before it had a smaller global warming impact than a lightweight plastic bag used only once. And, depending on the make, more durable plastic bags would have to be used at least 4 to 11 times before they made up for their heftier upfront climate costs.
So if you're going to opt for a reusable bag for environmental reasons, make sure you actually reuse it - often.
What's in the bag most likely matters more than the bag itself
It never hurts to think about bag choices. But keep in mind that if you're going to the grocery store, the food you purchase and place in that bag probably has a vastly bigger effect on the environment than whatever you use to haul it home.
Our global food system, after all, is responsible for one-quarter of humanity's planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions - with meat and dairy having a disproportionately large impact.
By contrast, packaging makes up only about 5 percent of the food system's footprint. Compared with, say, the effects of clearing away vast swathes of forest to grow feed or raise livestock, our bags are a much smaller deal.
Put another way, a pound of beef bought at the supermarket will have roughly 25 times the global warming impact as the disposable plastic bag it's carried in. So if you're looking for ways to slim down your personal carbon footprint, taking a closer look at your dietary choices isn't a bad place to start.

Texto completo: BY DAVID BAUDER
The Associated Press
Life hasn't been easy for singer Jenny Lewis since the sunnier days when she performed in support of a 2014 album while wearing a rainbow-hued pantsuit and carrying a guitar with similar bright colors.
Her mother died, and a 12-year relationship ended, sending Lewis on a cross-country journey in search of herself. Finally, with a new album finished, she's had to deal with the uncomfortable story of occasional collaborator Ryan Adams' alleged mistreatment of women.
Spending much of the upcoming year on tour might seem like a relief.
The up-tempo songs "Red Bull & Hennessy" and "Heads Gonna Roll" from her "On the Line" album, with Lewis' unerring sense of tunefulness, will get the initial attention. But the work's emotional core emerges in quieter, more introspective material like "Dogwood," Rabbit Hole" and "Taffy." Those are the songs that will stick.
Much of the material was written in stolen moments on borrowed pianos, in friends' apartments and hotel lobbies, where she had to keep quiet to avoid making a disturbance.
"I don't think of this record as being a breakup record," she said. "It's more of a rebound record. It's kind of the space in between."
The southern California native relied on a network of friends during her post-breakup travels, staying in musician St. Vincent's New York apartment, for example. She and two friends formed a band and wrote songs in a Manhattan storefront, where pedestrians mistook them for an art installation. She spent time in Nashville and Minnesota.
Even when she returned to California, Lewis used Airbnb to explore different parts of Los Angeles.
"I ran away," the 43-year-old said. "I really just got back here a couple of months ago. It was a three-year adventure."
How much of an adventure? It's hard not to notice all the references to alcohol and other substances sprinkled throughout the album's lyrics. There's Hennessy, of course. Grenadine. Bourbon. Beaujolais. Red wine (unspecific). Amphetamines. Paxil. A bong. Part of it is a good writer's attention to detail, however.
"It's relevant," she said.
She brings a bottle to a restaurant in the heart of Hollywood where she talked about her music. Not to drink: It's a gift for a friend, singer Nikki Lane, who's performing later that night nearby. A former child actress who turned to music and was a member of the group Rilo Kiley before going solo, Lewis has a wide circle of friends and admirers in the business.
None of that could have prepared her for the surreal experience she had at Los Angeles' Capitol studio while making "On the Line," however.
Lewis played on the piano that Carole King used to make "Tapestry," which is intimidating enough. Her band included former Tom Petty keyboard player Benmont Tench, record executive and bassist Don Was and the drum duo of Ringo Starr and Jim Keltner.
"That's one of my favorite moments in my whole life," she said. "Standing in the control room and watching Ringo and Jim play together, I was mesmerized. Of course I am thrilled, honored. Shocked, really. I kept thinking, 'Is someone doing somebody a favor here?'"
She believes it was Was who called in Starr. "I don't know exactly," she said. "He was just there with his drums."
Beck and Adams were two other big names who helped out. Adams, who produced Lewis' 2014 album "Voyager," produced some of the new music, too.
The association with Adams became noteworthy when the New York Times reported that he allegedly pursued younger female artists for sex and sometimes became verbally and emotionally abusive when turned down. Adams has denied the accusations.
Lewis was not included in the Times' story, and her interview with The Associated Press took place before the story was published. She declined a follow-up request to talk about it, and tweeted a statement: "I am deeply troubled by Ryan Adams' alleged behavior. Although he and I had a working professional relationship, I stand in solidarity with the women who have come forward."
Lewis subsequently held an online album-release party that doubled as a benefit for the Los Angeles Women's Center, and it raised more than $10,000.

Texto completo: Climate change research points to a future of extreme weather events in the Midwest, from major storms to longer periods of drought and more intensely hot days.
Planting and preserving trees can play a significant role in helping to mitigate the effects of a changing climate by reducing stormwater runoff, removing pollutants from the air and shading buildings to cut energy use.
The shade trees also can reduce the additional heat that accumulates in paving and buildings, known as "urban heat island effect."
With that in mind, the public is invited to hear leading environmental experts discuss promising new research and ongoing initiatives regarding trees and their significant environmental benefits when The Morton Arboretum presents "How Trees Can Help the World: Re-treeing Communities and Making the World a Cooler Place to Live" April 17 at 4100 Route 53 in Lisle.
The program will take place from 7 to 8:30 p.m. Admission is $25 and includes one drink ticket and light snacks. For details, visit mortonarb.org.
Among other things, panelists will explore what communities can do to prioritize tree plantings and care, thereby creating healthier, cooler and more sustainable places to live.
The featured speakers are: * Bill Schlesinger, a biogeochemist and president emeritus at the Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies in Millbrook, New York.
With a focus on environmental chemistry and global change, Schlesinger has written or co-authored more than 200 scientific papers, among them research on human impacts on forests and soil. His past work has taken him to diverse habitats, from the Mojave Desert of California to Antarctica. His research has been highlighted by CNN, NPR, The New York Times and National Geographic.
* Jeff Walk is the director of conservation at The Nature Conservancy in Chicago, where he leads a team of scientists in on-the-ground conservation initiatives, many of which address the challenges of climate change with nature-based solutions. These include protecting water quality in the Illinois River and other tributaries of the Mississippi River and expanding a monitoring program at Nachusa Grasslands, a tallgrass prairie conservancy in Franklin Grove, to better understand the impact of bison on prairie habitats.
* Chuck Cannon serves as the director of the Center for Tree Science at The Morton Arboretum.
Cannon leads scientists and researchers at the arboretum, connecting a large network of global collaborators to shape and expand knowledge of trees and forests around the world, and has long focused on the evolution and conservation of tree diversity.
Ongoing projects include creating advanced and effective technologies for tree science, as well as the development and implementation of a tree observatory platform for the collection of data on tree behavior, growth and status.
* Colleen Murphy-Dunning directs both the Hixson Center for Urban Ecology and the Urban Resources Initiative at the Yale School of Forestry & Environmental Studies in New Haven, Connecticut.
In her role, Murphy-Dunning partners with university faculty to lead field-based instruction on urban ecology for all incoming graduate students in the forestry and environmental studies program.
Prior to her work at Yale, she taught agroforestry at the Kenya Forestry College and reviewed natural resource operations in Papua New Guinea for the Rainforest Action Network.
* Lydia Scott is the director of the Chicago Region Trees Initiative, a collaboration between the arboretum and roughly 165 partner organizations across the region.
In leading the organization, Scott furthers CRTI’s mission to build a healthier and more diverse urban forest by 2050 as informed by findings from "Urban Trees and Forests of the Chicago Region," a regional tree census conducted by the arboretum and the U.S. Forest Service.
CRTI provides education, outreach and resources to more than 150 communities across the seven-county Chicago region to improve the health, diversity and canopy cover of the area’s urban forest.

Texto completo: Perched inside his apartment 12 stories above Washington Square Park, Andre Kertesz beheld a cityscape of trees, rooftops and snow-covered paths. Caught between distance and intimacy, his images revealed with affection and longing a Hungarian émigré who was an outsider in his adopted land.
"There is a kind of psychological component to it," Robert Gurbo, his estate's curator, told The New York Times in 2015, "where he is clearly looking to see what they have to see, what he has never had."
His desire for a room with a view led him and his wife, Elizabeth, in 1952 to the Greenwich Village apartment whose vistas offered a panoply of light, lines, shadows and textures. An exhibition of that work opened on Thursday at Bruce Silverstein Gallery.
"When he moved into 2 Fifth Avenue, the building was vacant and under construction and he went through every apartment looking for a specific vantage point that he would be able to photograph from," Mr. Gurbo told The Times. "He chose the 12th floor and he said it was because it was far away enough that it would flatten the field and create archetypal photographs, but close enough that he could get involved in the intimacy from below."
Washington Square Park's trees and paths marked the change of seasons, while the skyline had the no-nonsense flavor of postwar New York, before sharp-angled steel and glass towers began soaring ever higher. Some images are rendered in quick, visual strokes: shadows on a brick wall contrasted against skeletal tree, or snowfall reducing a scene to a sketchlike abstraction.
It's hard to behold the past knowing what befell the subject of one image he took in 1976. The photo, above left, shows two buildings dwarfing the landscape, encircled by a gauzy wreath of smoke. In the foreground, a cross juts into the frame. Behind that, the twin towers. It reminds us we are all outsiders, each looking at a spectral memory through our own, individual windows.

U.S. risks loving Israel to death

Texto completo: JERUSALEM - Amos Yadlin, the former head of military intelligence in Israel, likes to say that Israel as a Jewish-majority democracy faces two existential threats: a nuclear-armed Iran and turning itself into a binational state by permanently occupying the West Bank with its 2.5 million Palestinians. And while Israel has a strategy for addressing the first threat, it has none for the second.
A key reason that it doesn't, in my view, is due to a third existential threat. It's a threat from America - particularly from President Donald Trump, but also from pro-Israel lawmakers in Congress and from AIPAC, the Israel lobbying organization.
It's the threat that America will love Israel to death.
By indulging Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in his quest for permanent Israeli control over the West Bank, Trump, Congress and the Israel lobby are going to create a situation whereby the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank will eventually collapse. The Palestinians there will then tell Israel, as some already have, that they want Israeli citizenship. Israel will then find itself ruling over 2.5 million Palestinians with the choice of either sharing power with them on the basis of equality or systematically denying it to them.
When that happens the debate over what Israel should do will rip apart every synagogue, Jewish Federation and Jewish institution in America - including AIPAC. As long as there was a credible two-state solution on the table, that debate was muted. But once that's gone, all hell will break loose in the Jewish world and between progressives and Israel's supporters on every U.S. college campus. It's already started.
Up until Trump, Democratic and Republican presidents had played the role of "reality enforcer" for both Israeli and Arab leaders. In Israel and most Arab ruling circles, you have a mix of hard-liners, moderates and sheer crazies. The U.S. president's job has been to draw red lines so Israeli prime ministers or Arab leaders could say to their extremists: "Hey, I'd love to do that crazy thing you want me to do. My heart is with you. But the American president would break my arm if I did. So we're not going to do that crazy thing, even though my heart is with you!"
Trump has abandoned that U.S. role. Instead, he's pursuing a policy of steadily weakening the Palestinian Authority while steadily lifting restraints on Israel's creeping annexation of the West Bank.
Trump's "anything goes" approach for Israel is presented as a strategic shift. It's actually driven by Trump's quest to get more campaign donations from far-right Jewish megadonor Sheldon Adelson and to get Jews to leave the Democratic Party and vote Republican.
Bibi praises Trump and Trump gives Bibi the Golan Heights without asking for anything in return. Trump keeps weakening and threatening the Palestinian Authority and its president, Mahmoud Abbas, for "incitement" against Israelis while saying nothing when Netanyahu incites against Israeli Arabs, telling them that they are not real citizens, that only Jews are.
The Palestinian Authority in the West Bank is corrupt and mismanaged and does at times incite violence, but it's the last best hope for a two-state deal between Israelis and Palestinians. It also provides a basic infrastructure for Palestinian life and, as any Israeli intelligence officer will tell you, it provides vital, daily cooperation with Israel's security services that has helped to keep the West Bank largely quiet for years - and relieved Israel of the costs of administering it directly.
But the arms race between Trump and the Democrats over who can be more unblinkingly pro-Israel has now led to a series of punitive U.S. actions against the Palestinian Authority that have brought it close to collapse. This only hastens the day when Palestinians will say to Bibi and Trump: "OK, you guys won. We lost. The two-state solution is gone, so let us become Israeli citizens, and give us the vote."
No, you say, that will be prevented by Jared Kushner's peace plan. I doubt that. The Kushner plan appears to be one of autonomy for the Palestinians - not an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel - and Kushner's strategy is to offer the Palestinian people so many financial incentives that they will, in effect, overthrow their own leadership and accept the U.S. plan. Good luck with that.
In sum: There is no coherent U.S. strategy here. There is only a competition over who can love Israel to death the most for their own reasons.
So Trump will get his Adelson donations; Bibi will try to win re-election with Trump's help and try to avoid jail on corruption charges by partnering with a racist party; the Palestinians will get blamed for everything, only some of which they'll deserve; AIPAC will have a banner year raising money; Israel will keep absorbing the West Bank; and the question of whether or not to still support Israel - when it's no longer a Jewish democracy - will tear apart every synagogue and Jewish organization across the world.
And the AIPAC convention of 2022 will feature a panel discussion it's never had before: "Who lost Israel?"

Texto completo: Jimmy Butler will have a homecoming that could feature many more boos than cheers.
The 76ers will visit the Timberwolves on Saturday. It will be Butler's first game in Minnesota since he was traded to the Sixers on Nov. 12 with Justin Patton for Jerryd Bayless, Robert Covington, Dario Saric, and a 2022 second-round draft pick.
Last year, in his only full season in Minnesota, Butler helped lead the Timberwolves to their first playoff appearance in 14 years. But Butler, who can opt out of the final year of his contract this summer to become a free agent, didn't endear himself to Timberwolves fans right before the start of this season. Shortly before training camp, he told the team he wanted to be traded.
Butler did play 10 games this season with the Timberwolves before being dealt.
Earlier this week, he told the New York Times, "They are going to boo me." Then he added, "I would boo me, too."
*The Celtics have banned a fan from their games for two years for being verbally abusive toward the Warriors during their only visit to Boston this season.
The team says it didn't enforce a lifetime ban because its investigation couldn't prove that the fan used a racial slur toward Golden State forward DeMarcus Cousins.
According to a Yahoo! report, Cousins said the fan "muttered" a racial slur at him on Jan. 26.
The Celtics say the fan, who is a minor, was ejected from the game immediately after they received the complaint.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - Special counsel Robert Mueller's Trump-Russia report is more than 300 pages long, it was revealed Thursday, sparking fresh criticism from Democrats arguing that Attorney General William Barr's four-page summary is gravely inadequate and the full findings must be quickly released.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called Barr's synopsis that cleared President Donald Trump of campaign collusion with Russia and criminal obstruction of the federal probe "condescending and "arrogant.
"Mr. Attorney General, we do not need your interpretation, Pelosi said Thursday. "Show us the report and we'll come to our own conclusions. She mocked the administration and Republicans as "scaredy-cats.
The length of Mueller's confidential report makes clear that there are substantially more details he and his team have documented in their investigation than Barr disclosed to Congress and the public in his summary. The volume of pages was described Thursday by a Justice Department official and another person familiar with the document.
The DOJ official said Barr discussed the length of the report during a phone call Wednesday with House Judiciary Committee Chairman Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y.
Barr has been at work going through the document as the debate intensifies over if and when he will release the complete report and its underlying evidence amid Democratic concern that what has been made public so far is tilted in Trump's favor. Barr has said he'll release at least a partial version in April and also told Nadler he would agree to testify before his committee.
Also Thursday, House Democrats barreled ahead with their oversight of the Trump administration and Trump resumed his attack on Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., just as the chairman of the Intelligence Committee was about to gavel the panel into session.
"Congressman Adam Schiff, who spent two years knowingly and unlawfully lying and leaking, should be forced to resign from Congress! Trump tweeted earlier in the day.
Congressional Republicans formalized their demand that Schiff resign as chairman of the Intelligence Committee over his claim that there is significant evidence that the president and his associates conspired with Russia.
"We have no faith in your ability to discharge your responsibilities in line with the Constitution, the Republicans wrote to Schiff in a missive they read aloud at the hearing.
Republicans pointed to Barr's synopsis, released Sunday, that said Mueller's probe didn't find that Trump's campaign "conspired or coordinated with the Russian government to influence the 2016 presidential election.
Schiff stood by his remarks, listing the meetings those in Trump's circle had with Russians. He noted Trump's pursuit of a deal to build a Trump Tower in Moscow.
"There is a different word for that than collusion, and it's called compromise, Schiff said, as he opened the session. The hearing was called to provide an overview on how Russia has blackmailed Americans in the past.
Since Barr's findings were released, Schiff this week has repeated his assertion that evidence of collusion is in "plain sight. He says Mueller's failure to find a criminal conspiracy with Russia does not absolve the Trump campaign of its actions.
Pelosi stood by Schiff, saying she is proud of him and taunted Republicans - and Trump - for fearing the chairman whom she called a "patriotic leader.
"What is the president afraid of? Is he afraid of the truth? she said. "They're just scaredy-cats.
Outside the hearing room, the main battle continued over releasing Mueller's still-confidential report. The New York Times first reported Thursday that the report is more than 300 pages.
"I would hope the attorney general would not be acting as a political operative for the president, said Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., a member of the Judiciary Committee. "The Department of Justice should not be involved in a cover-up of what's actually in the report.
Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., chairman of the House Oversight Committee, said Wednesday he is disappointed that Barr would take weeks, not days, to release the report.
"The president has now an opportunity for weeks, it sounds like, to do these victory laps, Cummings said, noting that Trump's former lawyer, Michael Cohen, is among those headed to jail as a result of the probe. "Cohen goes to jail, the president runs a victory lap.
Barr told the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., that he's combing through Mueller's report and removing classified, grand jury and other information in hopes of releasing the rest to Congress.
Trump has said he's fine with releasing the findings. "The president said, Just let it go,' and that's what's going to happen, Graham said.
What's clear, though, is that Barr will miss the Tuesday deadline set by six House committee chairmen to see the full confidential report and its underlying documents. They have suggested they might try to get it by subpoena.

Childhood trauma an epidemic, Cappello tells Rooster Booster

Texto completo: "What percentage of our students do we write off?" Dominic Cappello, a New York Times best-selling author, asked those attending the Greater Owensboro Chamber of Commerce's Rooster Booster Breakfast on Thursday.
"Even 1 percent is too much," he told the gathering at the Owensboro Convention Center.
There is a hidden epidemic in America today, Cappello said.
It's called childhood trauma.
Children who experience childhood trauma are at a real disadvantage when they become adults, he said.
"They may not be productive workers," Cappello said. "Twenty-five percent seem lost and in need of more services."
He and Katherine Ortega Courtney wrote "Anna, Age Eight," a best-selling book on the prevention of childhood trauma and maltreatment.
The title comes from a girl they call "Anna," who was taken from her mother eight times and returned by social workers eight times.
When, she was 8, Cappello said, Anna was kicked to death by her mother.
All Americans, he said, agree that all children should be safe.
"But are we doing what's needed?" Cappello asked.
Adverse childhood experiences, he said, include physical and emotional neglect; physical, emotional and sexual abuse; substance abuse in the home; mental illness in the home; domestic violence; incarceration of someone in the home; and either divorce or separation of the parents.
It's time to survey local students on how many of those factors they have experienced, Cappello said.
In some classes that have been surveyed in other states, he said, two-thirds of the students reported three or more of those factors.
They don't report it, Cappello said, because they feel shame, anger and sadness about what's happening to them.
"If we don't do anything," he said, "we'll write off a quarter of them."
He said a local group -- Social Partners Advocating for a Resilient Kentucky, Owensboro, Daviess County (SPARKodc) -- is already working on programs to make the community more family friendly.
Cappello proposed a series of programs including 100 percent employment of adults.
"I know this is a bold idea," he said, "a moon shot. But we have to make sure we leave no one behind. We have to make Owensboro the safest place to raise a family."
Cappello, who lives in New Mexico, is the co-founder of Safety+Success Communities and the creator of the Ten Talks book series on family safety, which gained a national audience when he appeared on "The Oprah Winfrey Show."

Trump: Pulitzers awarded to NYT, Washington Post should be revoked for 'fake' Russia coverage

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump called for the Pulitzer Board to revoke the prizes awarded to The New York Times and The Washington Post for coverage of Russian interference in the 2016 election and the links between the Kremlin and the Trump campaign.
"So funny that The New York Times & The Washington Post got a Pulitzer Prize for their coverage (100% NEGATIVE and FAKE!) of Collusion with Russia - And there was No Collusion! So, they were either duped or corrupt?" the president wrote on Twitter on Friday. "In any event, their prizes should be taken away by the Committee!"
The sentiment has been a talking point for Republicans since Attorney General William Barr said special counsel Robert Mueller did not find a conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia, but it was the first time the president suggested that the media outlets have their Pulitzers – one of journalism's highest honors – stripped away.
The awards were given in 2018 for what the Pulitzer Board described as "deeply sourced, relentlessly reported coverage in the public interest that dramatically furthered the nation’s understanding of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and its connections to the Trump campaign, the President-elect’s transition team and his eventual administration. "
More: AG William Barr plans to release Mueller report by mid-April. 'Everyone will soon be able to read it. '
More: Mueller report: Investigation found no evidence Trump conspired with Russia, leaves obstruction question open
In a statement, The New York Times said the outlet's coverage stands and Barr's four-page letter summarizing the investigation only confirmed the work of its reporters.
"No report in our package of Pulitzer-prize winning work has been challenged," said Eileen Murphy, a spokeswoman for the company. "In fact, what we know of the Mueller report from the Attorney General’s summary confirms our coverage. Russia actively worked to upend the American elections in 2016 and there were multiple instances of Trump Transition and Administration officials having contact with Russia. "
The Washington Post, through a spokeswoman, said it did not plan on commenting on the president's tweet.
Throughout Mueller's investigation, dozens of individuals were charged, including members of Trump's inner circle, his campaign and his administration.
But no charges were filed specifically alleging a conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia to help him win the 2016 election, though Mueller and U. S. intelligence officials has concluded that the Kremlin was behind a massive campaign to interfere and influence the outcome of the election.
Mueller found, according to Barr's letter to members of Congress, that the Trump campaign did not conspire or coordinate with Russia "despite multiple offers from Russian-affiliated individuals to assist the Trump campaign. "
Barr said Mueller declined to reach a conclusion on whether the president sought to obstruct the investigation, though Barr said his own judgment was that Trump had not.
Barr's letter included very little from Mueller's nearly 400-page report. The full report is expected to be released publicly in mid-April, Barr told Congress on Friday.
The award-winning work by the Times and Post chronicles issues and warnings about former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn before he was charged as part of Mueller's investigation and Jared Kushner's Russian links.
Other stories revealed a meeting between top Trump campaign officials, including the president's eldest son, with a Russian lawyer in Trump Tower before the election and conduct by the president that led to questions over whether he may have attempted to obstruct the investigation, including asking former FBI Director James Comey to let go of an investigation into Flynn.

Remember: School quality linked to home value

Texto completo: Remember: School quality linked to home value If you own property, your home value is forever tied to the quality of the local public schools, whether or not you have kids in those schools. How much does school quality matter?
There’s plenty of research to show that your home value can rise or fall significantly based on the performance of local public schools. For example: * A RedFin survey concluded that a home in a top-ranked school district was worth $50 more per square foot vs. a home in an average school district. That means a 2,000-square-foot house, for example, is worth an extra $100,000 if the schools are strong.
* Brookings Institute studied the 100 largest metro areas and found that housing costs an average of $205,000 more in neighborhoods with high performing schools.
* Realtor.com indicates that home values in top-rated districts were 49 percent higher than the national median home price, and that even slight drops in school quality lowered home value.
* A New York Times study showed that for every 5 percent test scores went up, home value went up by 2.5 percent.
In short, quality public schools translate into real money for property owners. Any savvy property owner knows that strong schools matter.
In Glen Ellyn, there are only three candidates for the District 41 Board of Education who are committed to keeping our schools strong and our property values high in a fiscally responsible manner: Jessica Buttimer, Julie Hill and Ted Estes, the bottom three candidates on your slate. Buttimer, Hill and Estes have promised to reflect the community’s voice, respect the experts (including any recommendations by the Financial Advisory Committee), and make data-driven, fact-based decisions.
On April 2, vote the bottom three for District 41 BOE to bring fresh, levelheaded voices to the board.

Transgender Singing Voice Conference this weekend

Texto completo: In her years as an educator and leader in music, Danielle Cozart Steele noticed a void that needed to be filled.
She said there's an assumption that the music world is a safe space for those who identify as transgender and non-binary. Under the surface, however, that might not be the case. Early on in her work, there were very few, if any, resources in regards to best practices for transgender and non-binary music students.
These students might have to sing songs with which they don't identify or songs that don't represent them, further making them feel marginalized or isolated. Not to mention, they could face bullying. And they aren't necessarily guaranteed their name or pronouns will be respected by their music teacher.
So, Cozart Steele helped start the Transgender Singing Voice Conference, the second of which will take place Saturday and Sunday at Earlham College. The two-day workshop will gather voice instructors, educators and medical professionals who serve the transgender and non-binary singing community and provide hands-on experience for singers.
To Cozart Steele, the voice is inherently personal, which is why she is so passionate that everybody has the opportunity to not only express themselves, but also feel welcomed in the process. "The voice resides in the body, and so to produce the voice ... a piece of your soul or a piece of your identity comes out with that vocal production," Cozart Steele said. "There's nothing between you and the sound."
Alexander Reeves, who will speak and perform at the conference this weekend, has been singing since he was 12 years old and started hormones five years ago, right before his freshman year of college. He began auditioning as a soprano, the highest of singing voices, but soon struggled to control it.
"When I started college, I had about five notes that I could sing. That's what all my range was," Reeves said. "And when I had auditioned, I had about three octaves. It was because my voice was changing, and I had no control over it.
"So when I started, I was in a theater program, and I wasn't getting cast. I wasn't getting roles because nobody, including myself, really understood the mechanics of my voice and how it was changing."
Reeves said he was fortunate to have had a voice teacher who actually attended Earlham's first Transgender Singing Voice Conference with him two years ago.
"Not everybody is that lucky," he noted.
During the event Reeves will share his story and show how having access to knowledgeable sources helped him progress as a singer. He's now a tenor, and he loves it. He'll play attendees a clip of himself singing before he started hormones, then he'll perform live.
This year's conference aims to educate and produce new research, collaborations and networking opportunities for transgender and non-binary singers. Organizers also have collected more than 30 submissions of music that is by, for or about the transgender or non-binary community.
With a significant number of people in the United States who identify as transgender — 1.4 million adults as of 2016, according to a study reported in The New York Times — Cozart Steele continues to see the need for more research and resources. She expects 100-150 people at this weekend's conference, including graduate students who she says likely know someone who is transgender or non-binary, or who are themselves, "and they're eager to see this scholarship advance." She welcomes anyone interested to attend.
Registration for this weekend's conference is free for students and anyone for whom cost is prohibitive, $50 for eligible young professionals and $100 for all other professionals.

Texto completo: JEWS HAVE BEEN in Boppard and the Rhine Valley, and alternatively suffered and flourished there, for at least a millennium.
Historians report Jews being murdered in Boppard in the 11th century by crusaders and other antiSemites who perpetrated ritual murder inspired by the myth of "blood libel." By the 15th century, Jews were expelled from Boppard by the local bishop and did not return until the 16th century. By the 18th century, Jews established a permanent and apparently stable community.
The peak Jewish population of Boppard was about 100 at the turn of the 20th century and 92 Jews were there by the time the National Socialist German Workers' Party (Nazi Party) took power.
In Boppard, Jews were assaulted on Kristallnacht in 1938 and Jewish-owned homes and businesses were wrecked. Most Jews fled by 1941. In April 1942, the towns remaining 32 Jews were deported. At least 52 Boppard Jews perished in the Holocaust. Three Jews settled in Boppard after World War II but subsequently left.
The plundered and destroyed synagogue was reintegrated into the cityscape decades later. The building was purchased by optician Robert Holz in 1990 and, after compiling old documents and information, he had it renovated and restored.
Elsewhere in the Rhine Valley, Peter Worstsman reported in The New York Times in 2014, "There have been Jews in the Rhineland for as long as anybody's been singing about it. They first sailed down the Rhine along with the Roman army. The earliest written testament to Jewish life in the region is an edict signed in A.D. 321 by Emperor Constantine allowing Jews to be elected to the curia of Cologne." He went on to discuss Jewish communities in Cologne, Mainz, Worms and Speyer.
It is estimated that more than 115,000 people who identify as Jewish live in contemporary Germany. It is difficult to know how many of them live in the Rhine Valley, but many Jews do live there today. While German Jews still endure antiSemitism, they continue to persevere. *

Mueller report more than 300 pages long

Texto completo: Special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia report is hundreds of pages in length, according to a new report.

Mueller’s report, which has not been shared with the public or submitted to members of Congress, is more than 300 pages long, the New York Times reports. The lengthy report stands in stark contrast to the four-page summary of Mueller’s findings that Attorney General William Barr shared on Sunday with Congress.

During Mueller’s 22 months investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election and possible collusion between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin, he “did not find that the Trump campaign or anyone associated with it conspired or coordinated with Russia in its efforts to influence the 2016 U.S. presidential election,” Barr’s summary said.

After Trump fired FBI Director James Comey in May 2017, Mueller also began investigating whether Trump obstructed justice. Mueller declined to make a determination in the obstruction inquiry, and Barr said he and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein concluded there was insufficient evidence to show the president committed a crime.

Unsatisfied with the brief summary, House Democrats set an April 2 deadline for the Justice Department deliver the full Mueller report and the underlying documents.

House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., said Wednesday the Justice Department was unlikely to meet the deadline based on a conversation with Barr.

“He told me it was a very substantial report ... one that in my opinion no four-page summary can do justice to,” Nadler told reporters, adding that Barr repeated a prior commitment to delivering at least a partial version of the report to Congress in “weeks, not months.”

Nadler said he was not satisfied with Barr’s response.

“April 2 is a hard deadline that we set and we mean it,” the New York Democrat said. “I am very concerned that it is apparent that the department will not meet the April 2 deadline that we set and I’m very disturbed by that.”

What's On Thursday

Texto completo: It's a night of sitcom beginnings and endings as "Abby's" debuts on NBC and "Broad City" concludes on Comedy Central.
What's on TV
ABBY'S 9:30 p.m. on NBC. Episodes of NBC's newest sitcom begin with this twist on a common preshow message: "'Abby's' was filmed before a live outdoor audience." And it's true; this multicamera sitcom, created by Josh Malmuth (a writer and producer of the now-over Zooey Deschanel sitcom "New Girl"), stars Natalie Morales ("Parks and Recreation") as a former Marine who builds a bar in her backyard. Its regulars quickly come to include characters (in every sense) played by Neil Flynn ("The Middle"), Nelson Franklin ("Veep") and Jessica Chaffin ("Search Party"). While the idea of a tavern peppered with weirdos is well established (see "Cheers"), the show's outdoor filming promises to shake up the convention, something that the camera makes a point of reminding viewers of when it occasionally peels away to show the live crowd. "You see the audience; you see that we're, like, literally on the side of a cliff in Universal Studios; you see the Los Angeles city lights; and then you see us on this weird little outdoor set, acting," Morales recently told The New York Times. "It's going to feel familiar, but it's also going to feel very novel."
BEAUTY AND THE BEAST (2017) 8 p.m. on TNT. Tim Burton's "Dumbo," in theaters this weekend, is the latest in a string of live-action/digital hybrid remakes of animated Disney films. An earlier one is this updated take on "Beauty and the Beast," which is moodier than its animated predecessor and stars Emma Watson (the beauty) and Dan Stevens (the beast). "Its classicism feels unforced and fresh. Its romance neither winks nor panders," A. O. Scott wrote in his review for The Times. "It looks good, moves gracefully and leaves a clean and invigorating aftertaste."
BROAD CITY 10 p.m. on Comedy Central. The New York comedy "Broad City" made stars of its creators, Abbi Jacobson and Ilana Glazer. It comes to a close on Thursday after five years on Comedy Central -- and almost a decade after it began as a web series -- with an episode simply titled "Broad City." When the pair had finished writing this finale, "We filmed ourselves reading it," Jacobson told The Times. "Crying," Glazer then added, "laughing, crying, laughing, crying, laughing. It is crazy."
What's Streaming
KING COHEN: THE WILD WORLD OF FILMMAKER LARRY COHEN (2018) Stream on Shudder; rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. The writer and director Larry Cohen, who died on Saturday at 82, was an auteur maker of low-budget genre movies like IT'S ALIVE (1974), a horror film about a killer baby. That movie, streaming on Google Play, Vudu and YouTube, would make a fine, fittingly outrageous companion to this documentary on Cohen, which features the director speaking alongside some of his admirers, who include Martin Scorsese. "If you don't know the man, you should," Glenn Kenny wrote in his review of the documentary for The Times. "And this is a lively, informative introduction."

James A. Winn, who was a writer, BU English professor, and flutist, dies at 71

Texto completo: A few weeks ago, knowing the end wasn't far off, James A. Winn was writing his memoirs, editing a flute-piano duet he had recorded a few months earlier, and coping with the end stage of pancreatic cancer, whose grim, initial prognosis he had far outlived to give his life an often joyous coda.
His thoughts also turned to what inevitably lay ahead as met with an Episcopal priest to plan a memorial service. “I've been trying to confront my fears and sorrows," he wrote to friends on his caringbridge.org journal.
To that end, as a longtime English professor, he quoted from a famous early-1600s sonnet by John Donne:
Death, be not proud, though some have called thee
Mighty and dreadful, for thou art not so;
For those whom thou think'st thou dost overthrow
Die not, poor Death, nor yet canst thou kill me.
Dr. Winn, who wove together a career as an English professor with decades of performances and recordings as an accomplished flutist, died in his Brattleboro, Vt., home Thursday. He was 71 and had retired in 2017 from Boston University, after teaching through the early months of his diagnosis.
“His life was the life of one who was passionate about ideas and about beauty in all of its manifestations — and that was quite infectious," said Linda Gregerson, a poet and a professor of English and creative writing at the University of Michigan, where he taught before joining BU's faculty in 1998. “He was also, as a colleague, quite an inspiration and a little bit daunting."
Dr. Winn could read German, Greek, French, and Latin. He could write poetry, along with interpreting it in books and journal articles. A scholar of 18th century British literature, he was equally at ease praising and illuminating the lyrics of the Beatles and Bruce Springsteen.
“He could recite an uncanny amount of poetry. Give him a line of Shakespeare and he'd be off," said his daughter, Ellen, who lives in Brooklyn, N.Y. “Somebody called him a flypaper brain. He didn't forget. He had a big, big brain and a big, big heart."
Globe reviewer Robert Taylor said Dr. Winn had written a “first-rate biography" when he published “John Dryden and his World" in 1987.
A New York Times reviewer was even more effusive about the way Dr. Winn examined the 17th century poet's life. The book was “the most important biography of Dryden ever written," Richard Bernstein wrote.
“Dryden's great lesson is that a writer can be simultaneously engaged in the most public issues — in his case, politics and religion and their intertwining — and be engaged at the highest level of his craft," Dr. Winn told Bernstein then. “The lesson is to use poetry to make precise, targeted, moral statements about our world."
Dr. Winn did that himself in his 2008 book “The Poetry of War," which looked at how poets had viewed wars from ancient Greece to Afghanistan and Iraq.
Poetry, he wrote, is necessary “to counter the mindless simplifications of war propaganda."
Throughout history, “soldiers trusted poets to make their deeds immortal, and poets embraced warfare as a grand challenge," he added, and in turn poets used “the full range of poetry's powers to express the full range of our contradictory responses to war."
Born in Charlotte, N.C., in 1947, James Anderson Winn was the second of four children. His father, the Rev. Albert Curry Winn, was a Presbyterian minister who formerly served as president of Louisville Presbyterian Theological Seminary. His mother, Grace Neely Walker Winn, worked in early childhood education and was “a passionate lifelong worker for peace," her son would later write.
Dr. Winn grew up mostly in Tuscaloosa, Ala., and Louisville, Ky., a formative experience.
“People in the South have a much more tragic and complex sense of history than, say, my students here in the Midwest," he told the Times when he was teaching at the University of Michigan. “We grew up with a very large sense of the past."
Early on, he began playing the flute and also could sing and play guitar and piano. At Princeton University, from which he graduated in 1968 with a bachelor's degree in English, he performed with the orchestra and sang with the Footnotes a cappella group.
He was then drafted into the Army, serving as principal flutist in the 50th Army Band.
For his doctorate, Dr. Winn attended Yale University, graduating in 1974. He went on to teach at Yale for several years before joining Michigan's faculty in 1983.
He was founding director of the Institute for the Humanities at Michigan, where he held dual appointments as a professor of English and of music. At BU, he had chaired the English department and directed the Center for the Humanities.
Throughout, he wrote books about literature and about music, and he recorded several CDs as a flutist — achieving more in two separate fields than many academics do in one.
“I don't know anybody else like him. He became a unique figure in the areas he represented," said Robert Freeman, who most recently had been dean of fine arts at the University of Texas Austin and before that had been president of New England Conservatory and director of the Eastman School of Music at the University of Rochester in New York.
“He lived life fully and he put an enormous amount of energy into it," Freeman added.
Dr. Winn formerly was married to Kathe Fox, with whom he had two children who, he later wrote, were “endless sources of joy and wonder." In 2009, he married Lucy Chapman, a violinist who has chaired the chamber music faculty and the strings studio faculty at New England Conservatory.
“They traveled and cooked and gardened and did all manner of things together," his daughter Ellen said, adding that Dr. Winn was “an incredibly good cook and a very involved father" — someone who liked hosting a crowd of 25 at Thanksgiving.
As a professor, Dr. Winn “was both a wonderful teacher and an incredible mentor," said Julie Peters, a professor of English and comparative literature at Columbia University who formerly was his student at Yale.
In an entry on his CaringBridge journal, she wrote that he was “also a person of such unbridled enthusiasm for the pleasures and possibilities of life, a person who taught that it might sometimes be better to embrace a knowing naiveté over a jaded worldliness, and that one could be ironic without a hint of cynicism."
In addition to his wife, Lucy, and daughter, Ellen, Dr. Winn leaves his son, Philip of Brooklyn, N.Y., and four grandchildren, all of whom were born since his diagnosis. “He was always happy to have a baby in his arms," his daughter said.
A memorial service will be held at 1 p.m. April 6 in St. Michael's Episcopal Church in Brattleboro, Vt.
Dr. Winn “was an exuberant and intense man about everything in his life," Ellen said.
“He was spectacular," Gregerson said. “He was kind of frighteningly articulate and upbeat and well-organized and well-read and filled with unflagging energy. It kind of left many of us in awe, frankly."

At a presentation at Apple's headquarters in Cupertino, Chief Executive Tim Cook also unveiled new subscription services for news and video games. The Netflix-style news service, dubbed Apple News+, will cost $9.99 a month and include journalism from the Los Angeles Times, the Wall Street Journal and hundreds of magazines.
The push is part of the tech giant's broader efforts to grow revenue from its services business as sales of its flagship product, the iPhone, slow down.

"We believe in the power of journalism and the impact it can have on our lives," Cook said. "We want to make a valuable contribution to the industry and society as a whole."
With more than a billion active Apple devices worldwide, and more than 200 million in the United States and Canada combined, news organizations hope the partnership will expose their work to a vast new audience.
"Apple News+ provides a perfect platform for our expanded coverage of news, analysis, and opinion," Los Angeles Times Executive Editor Norman Pearlstine said in a statement. "We share a world vision that is informed by our California roots and by our common commitment to innovation and excellence."
The ad-free streaming service, called Apple TV+, will launch in the fall and be available in more than 100 countries, the company said at the star-studded event in Cupertino.
"Great stories can move us and inspire us. They can surprise us and challenge our assumptions," Cook said. "So we partnered with the most thoughtful, accomplished and award-winning group of creative visionaries who have ever come together in one place, to create a new service unlike anything that's been done before."
In a further revamp of its TV strategy, Apple announced a new version of its Apple TV app debuting in May that will make it easier for users to sort through the shows and movies they want to watch, and get recommendations based on their viewing habits. The app will also allow users to pay for a la carte channels including HBO, Showtime, Starz and CBS All Access.
The company has a long history of making hardware -- iPhones, iPads and Macs. But it is a relatively new player in the world of original productions.
Apple is expected to spend $1 billion to $2 billion a year on its original content. The company has roughly two dozen shows in production or development, many of which were touted during Monday's event with a roster of stars making appearances.
Spielberg, Reese Witherspoon, Jennifer Aniston, Jason Momoa and even Big Bird took to the stage. A black-and-white promotional video featured interviews with J.J. Abrams and Octavia Spencer. The company had Sara Bareilles sing the theme song from her show "Little Voice."
Spielberg received a standing ovation. He encouraged people to check out his show, a reboot of the 1980s broadcast anthology series "Amazing Stories." "We want to transport the audience with every episode," Spielberg said.
Winfrey, who is working with Apple on two documentaries, including one called "Toxic Labor" on sexual harassment and assault in the workplace, also touted her partnership. She also said she would use the new service to amplify her book club efforts.
"I am proud and honored to be a part of this new platform where I can connect with people around the world to share meaningful ways to create positive change," Winfrey said.
But Apple declined to reveal pricing for the service and offered little footage of its upcoming shows.
"There are still a lot of unanswered questions," said Gene Munster, a managing partner with venture capital firm Loup Ventures.
Some in Hollywood are skeptical whether Apple will succeed, citing the company's cautious approach to content and heavy competition from the likes of Netflix, which has roughly 140 million paid subscribers and is expected to spend $15 billion on content this year. Apple shares on Monday declined $2.31, or 1%, to $188.74.
Apple is pouring its money into a select number of high-quality shows rather than trying to match Netflix's massive quantity.
Some analysts said they believe there will be demand for uplifting, inspiring content as Apple tries to brand itself with family-friendly shows, unlike other pay channels that offer edgier content. Apple devices are not just in the hands of adults but are widely used by older children and teens, said Kris Hull, a senior vice president at market research firm Kantar.
"It gives parents a little bit more of a sense of safety that their kids aren't going to be ultimately exposed to content they don't want them to see," Hull said.
Apple's new streaming platform won't dethrone Netflix, but it should grow the services business, said Tim Bajarin, president of advisory services firm Crea-tive Strategies.
"I don't see this as a Netflix killer," he said. "This is an economics story."
In a tactical shift, Apple also said its revamped TV app will work with other TV manufacturers such as Sony and across other platforms such as Roku. Apple previously made its Apple TV app available only on the company's own devices.
In addition to unveiling a new credit card, the company also launched Apple Arcade, a subscription service available this fall that will provide access to more than 100 new and exclusive games that can be playable offline. Pricing was not announced.
Many analysts are bullish on Apple, saying it already has a loyal fan base with more than 900 million active iPhones worldwide, providing a potentially vast distribution network for content.
After its launch in 2015, Apple Music, the company's streaming music service, accumulated more than 50 million paid subscribers. While that number is smaller than rival Spotify's 96 million subscribers, Apple Music's growth shows how quickly Apple can amass a significant business.
"You've got to strike when the iron is hot and monetize your install base," said Daniel Ives, a managing director of equity research for Wedbush Securities.
Services, a business category that includes Apple Music and mobile payment option Apple Pay, generated $37 billion in revenue the last fiscal year, up 24% from the prior year.
Apple's launch of a paid news service comes at a time when many newspapers and magazines are coming to embrace a digital subscription-based business model after years spent struggling to squeeze revenue out of online ads as print subscriptions dwindle.
The company will split revenues with publishers, with Apple taking half the subscription fee and the remainder going to publishers based on their share of total readership on the new product, according to sources familiar with the deal.
Apple's 50% cut is higher than the 30% the company typically takes out of app purchases and subscription fees through its App Store. According to the New York Times, those terms have turned off some leading national newspapers -- the New York Times and the Washington Post reportedly have chosen not to participate.
"Apple's choice of The Times as a revenue-sharing partner validates our commitment to high-quality journalism," said Los Angeles Times owner and Executive Chairman Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong.
Soon-Shiong has ambitions of building The Times' digital subscriber base from its current size of 150,000 up to 5 million. He said that the shift to a subscriber model has been made necessary by the "unfair usurpation" of ad revenue by companies like Facebook and Google, which together control close to 60% of the U.S. digital advertising market.
"We have every confidence the Apple affiliation will spur the growth of our digital subscriptions," Soon-Shiong said in a statement Monday.

Texto completo: At awards banquet, Md. governor calls for civility in public discourse
Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, who is weighing a primary challenge to President Trump, drew a sharp contrast with the president's anti-media rhetoric Monday, telling a crowd of hundreds at a journalism awards banquet in downtown Washington that he respects reporters and their "noble profession."
"You may not always get it right, but you are not fake news," Hogan (R) said to applause at the banquet for the Toner Prize for Excellence in Political Reporting.
Referencing another of Trump's favorite attacks against the media, Hogan told the gathering of political reporters that "you are not the enemy of the people. And it is that kind of dangerous rhetoric that threatens to undermine and erode the trust between the people and the very institutions that are the cornerstone of our democracy."
Hogan, a moderate who was easily reelected to a second term last year, called for civility in public discourse, emphasizing many of the same themes that helped make him a popular figure in a state dominated by Democrats.
"Those of us blessed by your trust should give you a government that appreciates that no one of us has all the answers or all the power," he said. "A government that tolerates contrary views among a diverse citizenry without making them into enemies or doubting their patriotism."
Since his inauguration in January, Hogan has warmly received the courtship of some GOP leaders seeking an alternative to Trump.
The governor has acknowledged that a primary challenge right now appears politically impossible, given Trump's overwhelming support within his party. But he says he would consider jumping into the race if the president's base weakens. And he has increasingly ventured onto the national political stage this year after spending the past four years mostly avoiding it.
In his speech Monday, Hogan praised reporters and said they "represented one of America's most important and all too often underappreciated professions."
He described rushing to the scene of the June 28 shooting rampage at the Capital Gazette newspaper in Annapolis, where five employees were killed. The suspect had a long-standing grudge against the newspaper.
Hogan praised the newspaper's surviving reporters for continuing to work outside the crime scene tape and covering the massacre of their colleagues.
The Toner awards honor the late New York Times writer Robin Toner, the first woman to be a national political correspondent for the newspaper. She died of cancer, a disease that Hogan also has battled, in 2008.
This year's political reporting prize went to Jason Zengerle for his writing in the New York Times and GQ magazines. Fact-checkers Glenn Kessler, Salvador Rizzo and Meg Kelly of The Washington Post and Isaac Arnsdorf of ProPublica were given honorable mentions.
Past keynote speakers at the awards ceremony include President Barack Obama in 2016 and Hillary Clinton. Former Ohio governor John Kasich, a moderate Republican, also was a speaker. Hogan was invited to ensure that the awards ceremony highlighted speakers from both sides of the aisle, said Peter Gosselin, Toner's husband and a journalist at ProPublica.
On Monday, Hogan repeatedly alluded to Trump without mentioning the president.
"The biggest crisis facing our nation isn't a wall between Mexico and the United States," he said, but a wall that divides discourse in America.
Hogan also said Americans are weary of a government in which "insults substitute for debate, recriminations for negotiation, and gridlock for compromise."
"I believe that you should be able to have confidence in the character and civility of the people you elect to office, regardless of their party affiliation," he said.
The governor's speech noted that his father's place in history was documented by the Washington political press corps during the Watergate scandal. Lawrence Hogan Sr., then a representative from Maryland, was the first GOP congressman to vote to impeach President Richard M. Nixon.
The elder Hogan taught at the University of Maryland earlier in his career, his son said.
Hogan characterized his relationship with the Maryland press corps as sometimes spirited but said that he "always had the greatest respect for the journalists."
"I know that this is a difficult and challenging time for your profession," Hogan said. "Faith and confidence in the media is nearly as low as it is for elected officials. Welcome to the club."

Texto completo: Celebrated Southern writer John T. Edge, who profiled iconic local restaurants in a recent episode of the television show TrueSouth, will return to Shreveport in May to deliver the commencement address to Centenary College's Class of 2019. Edge will also receive an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters from the College during the commencement exercises in the Gold Dome on Saturday, May 4.
Edge created TrueSouth for the SEC Network/ESPN along with executive producer Wright Thompson and hosted the first season of four episodes that premiered in September 2018. The Shreveport-Bossier episode, the fourth in the inaugural season, aired on Oct. 9, 2018 and highlighted local arts and culture alongside two beloved local eateries, Herby-K's and Lucky Palace Chinese Restaurant. The series explores the intersection of food and Southern culture as a vehicle for telling honest stories about the past, present, and future of the region.
"Part of our new strategic plan calls for an honoring of 'place' – specifically the Shreveport/Bossier City/Ark-La-Tex region," says Dr. Jenifer K Ward, provost and dean of the college at Centenary. "John T. Edge's work with TrueSouth helped highlight the meaning of food in the bridging of identities and cultures in our region, as well as the way in which storytelling can frame and create unifying ritual moments in communities. We are overjoyed that he has accepted our invitation to return to Shreveport and address Centenary's Class of 2019, and we hope that many community members will gather with us on May 4 to hear John T. and to celebrate our graduates."
Edge has built a career examining and celebrating the relationship between food and culture in the American South. He has written or edited more than a dozen books, including the critically acclaimed 2017 volume The Potlikker Papers: A Food History of the Modern South, named a book of the year by NPR, Publisher's Weekly, and others. He is a contributing editor at Garden & Gun magazine, a columnist for the Oxford American, and for three years wrote the monthly "United Tastes" column for the New York Times. Edge has won three James Beard Foundation awards, including the 2012 M.F.K. Fisher Distinguished Writing Award.
Edge is also director of the Southern Foodways Alliance at the University of Mississippi, an organization that has completed more than 900 oral histories and 100 films documenting the diverse food cultures of the American South. The organization also stages three yearly symposia and publishes a journal and podcast, "Gravy." Edge edits the SFA's series Studies in Culture, People, and Place published by the University of Georgia Press.
The 2019 commencement exercises at Centenary begin at 10:30 a.m. and are free and open to the public. More information, including a live stream link that will be available on the day of the ceremony, is available at centenary.edu/graduation.

Psychic Mediums Intuit a New Role

Texto completo: "Intuition is magical, but it's not reserved for a couple of people," said Laura Lynne Jackson, 46.
She's from Commack, N.Y., and makes her living as a psychic medium, and she was talking to hundreds who attended this year's In Goop Health Summit in New York City (tickets start at $1,000) who were there to learn how to tap into their inner intuition. "It's for all of you," she said.
Ms. Jackson, who was joined by four other professional "intuitives" at the event (which also featured speakers like medical doctors, nutritionists and C.E.O.s), is one of several new mediums entering the growing industry of self-care.
While psychics have traditionally profited from claiming to predict the future or communicating with deceased relatives, many are now working in the general field of wellness, calling themselves "intuitives" or "intuitive healers," who channel "energy" that helps people discover what they want out of life.
"A majority of the mediums that we work with are less interested in the party trick of showing off their psychic abilities and more focused on teaching people, women in particular, how to trust their guts and lean into their intuition," Noora Raj Brown, the senior vice president of communications at Goop, wrote in an email.
In a so-called Spirit Studio, Joe Perreta, 29, and Kim Russo, 54, both psychic mediums, hosted group readings where believers seemed to significantly outnumber skeptics, with teary attendees reaching for tissue boxes placed around the room.
During one session, Ms. Russo approached Lauren Lamb, 38, and said her mother, who had died, wanted to pass on advice related to redecorating a room. Ms. Lamb said she was redoing her house, and some of the details Ms. Russo provided felt inexplicably specific to her.
"How would she possibly know that? I'm a believer now," Ms. Lamb said. "I also think she was saying some stuff where she wasn't just channeling people, she was like, 'Here's my advice, and I was like, 'That's useful advice for people."'
This exchange is a gift to critics looking for examples of how Gwyneth Paltrow's wellness media empire peddles expensive quackery in the name of self-care. But, spirit visitations aside, Ms. Lamb is far from alone. A recent survey by the Pew Research Center found that 62 percent of Americans believe in at least one of four spiritual concepts identified as "New Age" (like reincarnation and astrology) and 41 percent believe in psychics.
One market analysis found that the "psychic services" industry grew steadily over the past five years, reaching over $2 billion in revenue in 2018 from activities like readings and public talks.
The Communication Business
Celebrities, many of whom -- like Ms. Paltrow -- have extended their brands to content (if only on their personal social-media accounts), increasingly include mediums in their self-care entourage. Rosanna Arquette and Kathy Hilton (mother of Paris and Nicky) plugged Ms. Jackson. Erika Gabriel, another medium, boasts that her clients include Minka Kelly and Tory Burch.
Lifetime promotes its show "Seatbelt Psychic" by declaring that the star, the medium Thomas John, is "a trusted adviser to influencers and celebrities" including Courteney Cox and Goldie Hawn.
Handily, dead celebrities can also be invoked: At In Goop Health, Deganit Nuur, a "clairvoyant intuitive," said John Lennon was "totally" one of her spirit guides. "I call him in all the time, and he's always like, 'Do this, do that,' and I'm like, 'Thanks, John!"' (Supposedly clairvoyant healing sessions with Ms. Nuur are available at the Four Seasons hotel's spas in New York City and Los Angeles.)
This is, of course, one of the planet's oldest professions.
In various ancient cultures, shamans were considered a link to the spirit world. Haitian Voodoo, Puerto Rican Brujeria, and Wiccan traditions all focus heavily on communing with spirits. In the United States in the late 1800s, Spiritualism, a religious movement in which séances to communicate with the dead were a central practice, was incredibly popular.
While the language is different, communicating with spirits on the so-called other side is also an accepted practice in Christianity. Angels are central characters in biblical stories, and when human beings die, telling believers that loved ones will "always be with them" as spiritual guides is common practice.
Media-savvy mediums are nothing new, either. In the 1990s Miss Cleo advertised her pay-by-the-minute services on late-night infomercials with the catchphrase "You have questions, I have the answers."
Today, in New York, turban-clad psychics, many with crystal balls and tarot cards, regularly lure Times Square tourists for $10 readings, and sandwich-board signs advertising psychic readings dot sidewalks all over the city. It is a self-regulated industry, with professional associations like the Windbridge Research Center in Tucson and the Forever Family Foundation in Oceanside, N.Y., offering certification, based on their own protocols, like psychological tests.
Sometimes duped-feeling clients call foul: in May 2015, a psychic named Priscilla Kelly Delmaro, 26, was charged with grand larceny after Niall Rice, a 33-year-old British consultant, accused her of taking thousands of his dollars. Ms. Delmaro was charged and spent eight months in jail.
A reading can be harmless fun, like reading horoscopes, but the incursion of psychics into health care might raise eyebrows. Anthony William, the self-proclaimed "medical medium," a.k.a., @medicalmedium, whose website includes praise from Pharrell Williams, Miranda Kerr and Robert De Niro, is behind a recent Instagram-fueled celery juice craze.
Mr. William advocates drinking a strict regimen of 16 ounces of celery juice every morning on an empty stomach. There is no science to substantiate his claim that this will solve all sorts of issues, only his citation of messages from "Spirit of Compassion."
Ms. Brown, of Goop, said content from mediums on the site is minimal albeit popular and is labeled "fascinating but inexplicable," as opposed to "supported by science." Mediums are screened by a phone call, sometimes by a Goop staff member, sometimes by a "trusted friend of Goop." According to Ms. Brown, the mediums do not know who they are speaking with.
The internet, with its troves of personal data, can be a boon to people claiming they are psychics -- or a trap. A New York Times Magazine story published last month followed a sting operation in which a group created fake Facebook profiles and then attended an event with Thomas John, where he quoted details from the made-up lives they had created.
At the end of February, John Oliver ran a scathing segment on psychics, which focused on mediums, many of whom were caught making predictions that were wrong.
In the segment, Mr. Oliver explained the two ways mediums defraud people into believing they communicate with lost loved ones: cold reading and hot reading. Cold reading is a technique in which mediums ask a serious of general questions and then rely on verbal and physical cues to glean increasingly personal information from an individual. Hot reading involves researching the people who are going to be in the room beforehand and using details from their online lives to fabricate readings.
What Mediums Say
"If we look at the big question that mediumship is fundamentally exploring, it's really: Is there life after death? And why are we here? Is there a connection between us? What is the meaning of all this?" said Ms. Jackson, whose first book, "The Light Between Us," appeared briefly on the New York Times best-seller lists. (She will publish a second in June.)
A weekend retreat she is conducting at the Omega in June costs $355. She would not disclose how much she charges for individual sessions, adding that she is booked for a decade.
MaryAnn DiMarco, 48, a medium and the author of "Believe, Ask, Act," said that her clients are increasingly not looking for predictions. "They're coming to me and saying, 'I have so much going on in my life. Can you teach me how to make connection so that I can make transformation happen in my life for the better?"' she said.
Joshua Agan, 33, turned to Ms. DiMarco after contemplating suicide; he had weighed 400 pounds, altered his diet and started going to the gym, but wanted more changes. "Once my body was taken care of, then it kind of naturally went into me kind of chasing the spiritual component," he said.
Mr. Agan, who owns a salon in Carmel, Ind., discovered Ms. DiMarco while attending a 2017 event hosted by Gabrielle Bernstein, a popular motivational speaker. He later flew to New York City with friends to attend a group reading and then, after Ms. DiMarco reached out to him personally with a message she said she felt she had to deliver to him, went back again for a one-on-one session, which she offered to him free of charge.
Ms. DiMarco, he said, allowed him to "step into my power and calmly let go of my existing experience," he said. "And trust my spiritual side to lead me in the right direction. It doesn't come with total assurance, right?"
Lisa Levine, 42, is the founder of Maha Rose, a wellness center in the Greenpoint section of Brooklyn that also operates a retreat center near the Catskill Mountains. She regularly hosts workshops with Ms. Nuur, the "clairvoyant intuitive" at In Goop Health, and said she believes there are people who can connect with the "other side" and bring back valuable information, but that the medium's intention is crucial.
"Is their intention to be a conduit for the spirits and to be of service to their clients, or is their intention to make a lot of money?" Ms. Levine said. "Telling somebody something that you think they want to hear, although not necessarily damaging, is maybe just like putting a Band-Aid on something. And maybe that is all the person wants, a Band-Aid, or some type of 'it's O.K., your deceased mother forgives you or your passed father does love you."'
"Our desire to believe will take a message a long way," she said.

Texto completo: Two Fort Carson soldiers, a Green Beret and a bomb-disposal technician, were killed Friday battling the Taliban in Afghanistan, the military said.
Spc. Joseph Collette, 29, of Lancaster, Ohio, and Sgt. 1st Class Will Lindsay, 33, of Cortez died in a battle in Kunduz province.
Collette was a newlywed and nine-year Army veteran who was on his first Afghanistan deployment, Fort Carson said. Assigned to the Post’s 71st Ordnance Group, he had earned the Army Achievement Medal four times.
“The 71st Ordnance Group is deeply saddened by the loss of Spc. Joseph P. Collette,” the unit’s commander Col. David Green said in an email. “We extend our deepest sympathies and condolences to his family and friends.”
Lindsay had served for 13 years in 10th Group and had earned the Bronze Star Medal four times, U.S. Special Operations Command said.
“Will was one of the best in our formation, with more than a decade of service in the regiment at all levels of noncommissioned officer leadership,” 10th Group commander Col. Lawrence Ferguson said in an email. “We will focus now on supporting his family and honoring his legacy and sacrifice.”
Collette’s wife, Caela, took to Facebook to express her grief.
“For those of you who don’t know, Joey was killed in action last night while serving our country,” she wrote. “I have no words but so many words at the same time. He was my best friend and I’m so lost without him right now.”
The couple was shown on Facebook in a happy wedding embrace in a December photo.
Woodmen Valley Chapel posted a plea for prayers for Lindsay and his fellow Green Berets.
“Please pray for our military and their families,” the church’s military ministry group posted in a Facebook tribute to the Green Beret who had also served five tours in Iraq. “Hearts broken for our 10th Group family.”
The two soldiers and an Afghan commando were killed during an allied mission to roll back the Taliban in the northern province.
The Pentagon said the incident that killed the pair remains under investigation.
Afghan officials told the New York Times that the Fort Carson casualties came during fighting in which an Afghan soldier was killed and three were wounded.
Fort Carson’s bomb-disposal soldiers frequently are assigned to work with Special Forces units. The technicians are experts in dealing with roadside bombs that have been a leading cause of U.S. casualties in the wars that followed 9/11.
The battle for Kunduz comes amid heavy fighting between Afghan government forces and Taliban militants while U.S. representatives are trying to broker a peace deal that could end the 17-year-old war, America’s longest.
After the deaths, an accidental firefight broke out between U.S. and Afghan forces and civilians might have been killed in an airstrike, the New York Times reported Saturday.
Since 2017, Green Berets from 10th Group have been training and advising Afghan commandos. The shadowy Fort Carson unit has made no public announcement of its involvement overseas, and the only indications of its work have come from casualty announcements.
If confirmed, the Special Forces death would be the first for 10th Group since Jan. 1, 2018, when a Green Berets was killed in Nangarhar Province.
American advisers fight alongside the commandos to provide them a connection to U.S. airpower and artillery, both of which remain in low supply for the Afghan military.
In Afghanistan, the Fort Carson Green Berets were joined this winter by the headquarters contingent of the 4th Infantry Division. Under Fort Carson’s Maj. Gen. Randy George, the headquarters is overseeing the bulk of the 14,000 American troops who remain there.
President Donald Trump has pledged a drawdown of U.S. forces in Afghanistan, with as many as 7,000 troops coming home. It’s unclear when that drawdown could begin.
In the meantime, Afghan and U.S. forces are part of a two-pronged strategy to end the fighting that began after the 9/11 attacks. Negotiators are meeting with Taliban leaders in Qatar in a bid to end the conflict. At the same time, U.S. and Afghan troops are hammering Taliban formations, in an offensive that could drive them to accept peace terms.
Four American troops have died in Afghanistan in 2019. Thirteen American soldiers were killed in Afghanistan fighting last year along with two others whose deaths were not tied to combat, Pentagon records show.

‘Jeopardy!’ champ Erik Agard to compete for second crossword title in Stamford

Texto completo: STAMFORD — The largest yet gathering of crossword enthusiasts — both those who fill them out and those who construct them — will Saturday descend upon the city, again turning the downtown Stamford Marriott into a puzzler’s paradise.
The 42nd annual American Crossword Puzzle Tournament — which calls this city home and has been played here but for an eight-year foray in Brooklyn — will not only have the most competitors yet, more than 720, but the most prize money on the line and, for the first time, a way for visitors to get in on the action through HQ Trivia, a phone app that mimics a TV game show.
Although the HQ Trivia event doesn’t count toward the traditional competition, it gives visitors a chance to get in on the mind games and win some money, said Will Shortz, The New York Times crossword puzzle editor who founded the event in 1978 and will again lead the show.
Shortz said the winner of the Saturday evening trivia game will get $50. And yes, he’s glad to back in the Stamford Marriott.
“It just feels like home,” he said.
Though the $50 is a nice haul, it’s nothing to compared the $5,000 that the grand prize winner will take home after dueling it out in sudden-death rounds Sunday.
All eyes then will likely be on last year’s champion, Erik Agard, who beat 2017’s champ and six-time winner Dan Feyer last year with a fewer than five-minute finish.
Agard went on to make internet waves as a “Jeopardy!” champion, one who answered a Final “Jeopardy!” question with an internet meme.
Prompted to answer “In a hint of the future, in 1973 Marjorie Post gave it to the U.S. Govt. as a warm-weather presidential retreat, but it was returned,” as read by host Alex Trebek last October, the stumped puzzler answered with a meme.
“What is you doing, baby?” Agard wrote.
Agard went on to win that day’s game and hauled in more than $66,000 over a three-day winning streak, according to Bethesda Magazine.
The correct answer, by the way, was “Mar-a-Lago.”
Another notable competitor lacks humanity, but could make a strong showing.
Dr. Fill, a computer program created by crossword constructor Matt Ginsberg was on a slow march toward the top 10 finishers — finishing No. 11 in 2017 — until last year the program came in 78th.

Texto completo: WAVELENGTHS

"Until two weeks ago, I was a staff writer for Surfer magazine," said Matt of his relationship with the oldest flagship of surfing's print community.

Now, his future with the magazine is under review to say the least. American Media, publishers of "National Enquirer" has purchased TEN (The Enthusiast's Network), a collection of sports and car magazines. Up to half of the staff may have already been cut and he is awaiting clarification of his enviable position.

He still has another major prestigious and intellectual surfing connection. Surfer's Journal ran a major story by Matt in the last issue of 2018, "27.6," about the Australian artist Paul McNeil.

Matt is also the editor for Void, the arts, culture and beach lifestyle magazine. He was born in Alexandria, Virginia (part of metropolitan D.C.) and makes Atlantic Beach his home now.

"My father was a carpenter and lifelong surfer. We traveled to Ocean City [Maryland] and Bethany [Delaware] so he could surf. We moved to Ponte Vedra when I was five. On weekends

we would load all of the toys and boogie boards and go the beach. I'd body surf and ride my boogie board, even standing up once in a while as my father surfed.

"I was not really into surfing back then; I played other sports. When I was a junior or senior at Nease (High School) I got back into surfing. You've got to earn it to really love it," Matt said of his reintroduction.

As a young child, it was just part of what he did while playing on the beach. Then, it became an obsession.

""It's so unlike any other sport. You shoot baskets over and over, but every wave is different. Repetition comes only after thousands and thousands of waves," said Matt.

Matt went to UNF on a Bright Futures scholarship, where he studied economics and social sciences with thoughts of becoming a teacher.

"I figured I could play music and write with my summers off," Matt said of those early plans. He decided to move to San Diego after graduation in 2008.

"California had always been this mythical place for me. My father once lived there and I had an uncle who lived there. I got a job as a remedial reading teacher at a residential school for foster kids," he said. It was a public/private partnership so I wasn't making much money. So I moved back here and started graduate school at UNF, majoring in secondary education and minoring in history."

He credits his great UNF professors for encouraging his writing and urging him to get a Ph.D. Then, another twist took him back to California for five more years, when his then-girlfriend (now wife) got into law school at Golden Gate University in San Francisco.

There he met Ashton Goggans, editor of the Australian surf magazine, Stab, and also a writer for the New York Times. When Goggans was offered the job as managing editor for Surfer magazine, he encouraged Matt to try writing and that became the key to his current career.

Samantha had interned in the San Francisco Public Defenders office and she wanted to stay and work there, but was told she should get some experience in another office and then apply. The Shaws decided to return to Jacksonville, thanks to family connections.

She was hired as a public defender in the 4th district and Matt entered grad school, again planning on getting that Ph.D.. He took on freelance writing assignments, including investigative reporting for Folio Weekly, a publication he respected for its investigative work.

"After six months, they were really supportive of me and their editor left. I met with Sam Taylor and Farrar Martin (publisher and president) and they offered me the job," said Matt.

Two months into it, Surfer magazine called and asked him if he wanted to go the Virgin Islands for a story with famed surfers Dylan Graves, Wade Goodall and Dane Gudauskas.

"I called Sam Taylor and told him about the opportunity and he asked how long I would be gone. ‘10 days.' He told me to 'go for it!'," Matt said.

He left with a crew of photographers and his first of 13 stories for Surfer ran about three months later. Matt found he wanted to keep his schedule open for more exciting assignments at Surfer. He has also produced 150 web pieces to date.

"I knew I couldn't do both well. I figured I could fill my basket with other stuff," he said of his decision to resign from Folio Weekly and rely on freelance work.

His most interesting interview for Surfer has been with film maker and a visual artist Thomas Campbell. In May 2018, Matt also went to Spain to cover a most unusual and famous longboard surf contest, Joel Tudor's Duct Tape Invitational.

"That turned into a special video. Joel Tudor is just the nicest human being. He is one of the best longboard surfers in the world, but he also has other interests<" said Matt. "You just key up a mike and he can talk forever on surfing, music and art. Ask him a question and just let the camera roll," say Matt of a project that became a 25-minute video that was very well received.

The opportunity to become editor of Void came about because he knew the staff from his time surfing with them.

"It was good timing. The editor was leaving. We had a great conversation about where I wanted to go with my work. I love this area and see a lot of potential for it. I want to give this region a platform for music, arts, surfing, and more. Jacksonville is not thought of as of music and art town (like it really is).

"My wife and I were expecting a baby and it is no longer responsible for me to go off to Bali for a month like I did a year ago," said Matt of his decision to settle in at Void. Baby Dylan is now four months old and perhaps awaiting her first surfing session.

"I am being paid to do stuff every day that that I love and might do even if I was not being paid," he said of what seems like an ideal fit for him.

That includes "Into the Void" sessions, where local bands come in the office and play their music. They recently released a vinyl record "Void on Vinyl" with indie rock, hip hop and Afro-Cuban music recorded in the office. The sound is vintage because of the echoes off the office's exposed concrete walls.

As someone who has surfer around the world, of our often dismissed surf: "When it's good here, it's as good as anywhere. Everyone get bummed about flat surf, but you have flat surf everywhere. Here, you can surf 300 days a year if you have the right board for the conditions."

Suspect in admissions case wants OK to travel

Texto completo: Former Georgetown tennis coach Gordon Ernst wants permission to travel throughout the country to look for work and care for elderly relatives while his case in the college admissions cheating scandal is pending.
Lawyers for Ernst, a 52-year-old Cranston, R.I., native with homes in Chevy Chase, Md., and Falmouth, made the request Thursday in a brief motion in US District Court in Boston, where the veteran coach faces a racketeering conspiracy charge in connection with the high-profile case.
While coaching at Georgetown over a period of several years, Ernst allegedly collected bribes totaling $2.7 million in exchange for designating “at least 12 applicants as recruits for the Georgetown tennis team, including some who did not play tennis competitively, thereby facilitating their admission to Georgetown," court records show.
He's free on $200,000 unsecured bond and scheduled to make his initial appearance in federal court in Boston on Monday, according to legal filings.
On Thursday, Ernst's lawyers asserted that his current pretrial release conditions, which restrict his travel to Maryland and Massachusetts for court appearances, lawyer meetings, and pretrial supervision, are tighter than conditions for the other 49 defendants in the sprawling case.
And, the motion said, Ernst has surrendered his passport and is not a flight risk. He has known about the probe since at least December 2017, according to the motion.
“Mr. Ernst has a legitimate need to travel throughout the continental United States," the filing said, noting that he plans to reside at his Cape Cod home when he's required to appear in federal court in Boston. “Mr. Ernst must also frequently travel to Rhode Island to care for his elderly mother and to Florida to care for his elderly mother-in-law, as both women live alone."
In addition, the motion said, Ernst “has been actively seeking employment since being placed on leave by his current employer [University of Rhode Island]. Mr. Ernst works as a tennis professional and anticipates finding employment in California or Florida due to the warmer climates in those states."
Prosecutors hadn't responded to the motion as of Friday evening.
Ernst hails from Rhode Island, according to a 2006 press release from Georgetown announcing his appointment as coach.
“He was the only athlete to win four straight Rhode Island High School State Tennis Championships in both singles and doubles and in 1985 the Cranston, Rhode Island native was the team captain of the United States Junior Davis Cup Team Camp," the release said. “In 2000, Ernst was inducted into the Cranston, Rhode Island Athletic Hall of Fame and in 2003 he was inducted into the Rhode Island Interscholastic League Hall of Fame."
The 2006 release also noted that Ernst had served since 2002 as executive director of Vineyard Youth Tennis on Martha's Vineyard.
Ernst served previously as a tennis instructor to former first lady Michelle Obama, according to a 2014 story in the New York Times, which quoted Ernst as saying that Obama had “a big backhand."
Georgetown has said that Ernst was no longer coaching there as of Dec. 17, “following an internal investigation that found he had violated University rules concerning admissions." He was hired by URI in August 2018, but the school confirmed earlier this month that he had been placed on leave because of the probe.
Ernst is one of 50 defendants charged in the scheme in which dozens of wealthy parents, including Hollywood stars and captains of industry, allegedly cut fat checks to have their children falsely certified as athletic recruits at prestigious schools, paving the way for their acceptance.
Some parents also allegedly ponied up cash to facilitate cheating on their children's SAT and ACT exams.

Texto completo: The festival-like Annapolis Oyster Roast and Sock Burning coming to the Annapolis Maritime Museum on Saturday is a far cry from the early history of the odd-duck nod to spring.
Coming out of the brutal winter of 1977, Bob Turner decided he'd had enough.
Turner was a South Carolina transplant to chillier Chesapeake country that year and looking back said the impetus for torching his winter socks was three-pronged.
"We were coming out of one of the worst winters. It was the equinox, it was a gorgeous sunny day," he said in a phone interview from his current roost in Pawleys Island, S.C. "And I was really tired of peeling off my socks to pick aluminum shavings out of them."
He was building aluminum masts and spars in a shop in Eastport. The process created shavings that would "for some reason get in your shoes and gather in the toes of your socks," he said.
So at the end of the day he grabbed an old paint rolling pan out of a pile, added some flammable naphtha and lit up his socks. There was, of course, beer involved. And a gaggle of his employees, who also peeled off their socks to add to the pyre. And had a beer - Budweiser longnecks, to be precise.
Garry Williams, proprietor of Osprey Marine Composites in Deale, was Turner's service manager and remembers the first few sock torchings.
"Bob was always a little eccentric. All of us came down," he said. "We had a small shop and most of the guys would hang around and have a beer or two at the end of the day."
And the mischievous nod to the equinox continued.
"Not only did I never have any idea it would catch on like it has, at the time I didn't think it would happen twice," Turner said.
But the next year they did it again. It continued for a few years as a small-scale excuse to have a beer, Turner noted, until about 1985, after he had become owner of the Annapolis Harbor Boat Yard, and he decided to spread the cheer.
"I went around to the marine businesses, sail lofts and boatyards and invited them to come on down, and we lit up the socks and had a few beers. I think we had about 40 people that day."
Within a few years the equinox tradition was picked up by the Eastport Yacht Club, whose clubhouse was built across the street from Turner's yard.
The club holds a sock burning to this day; members will singe their socks on the equinox on March 20.
The sock burning as a rite of the equinox continued locally then spread after the New York Times caught wind of it in 2004 and sent a writer down to Eastport. After the story ran, the stunt spread to ports far and wide.
The Oyster Roast and Sock Burning at the Annapolis Maritime Museum started in earnest in 2010 when they decided to make it an official thing after people had used its small beach to build a sock burning fire anyway.
It is held the closest Saturday to the equinox, if not on the day. Many of the hundreds who attend doff their winter socks and toss them into the fire, while others just enjoy the festivities - music by the Eastport Oyster Boys, food and oysters every which way, and yes, adult beverages.
Turner won't make it north for the party as he has not one, but three sock burning soirees to attend near home in Beaufort, N.C., Georgetown, S.C., and Myrtle Beach.
"I am running out of socks," he said.
The celebrations are all over. There's the Skidway Island Boat Club's event in Savannah, Ga.; five events around Lake Texoma on the Texas-Oklahoma border, and one in Ashtabula, Ohio.
Closer to home, there are events in Gloucester Point and Hampton, Va., and Havre de Grace.
"It has gotten out of hand," Turner said of the plethora of events. And though the occasion had grown beyond recognition - much like Eastport itself, from those sleepier days - he's OK with it.
"It was never intended to be a money maker, but in this case it is for a good cause," he said. This year's event will support he museum's work preserving the heritage of a local slice of the bay. "And if people get together and they laugh, it's all worth it."

What does Britain's government have against Christianity and Christians?

Texto completo: The government agency charged with overseeing immigration and passports in the United Kingdom has denied asylum to an Iranian Christian convert from Islam, explaining its verdict is based on its assessment that Christianity is not “peaceful.”

The decision by the Home Office puts the Iranian national's life in grave danger, as leaving Islam for any other religion is punishable by death in the Islamic Republic of Iran.

The applicant's claim he converted to Christianity because it’s a “peaceful” religion, as opposed to Islam, is “inconsistent” with the violent themes and rhetoric that appear in the Bible, British officials told the asylum-seeker.

Leviticus, Exodus, and Revelation are “filled with imagery of revenge, destruction, death and violence,” the Home Office explained in its rejection letter to the Iranian man, adding Leviticus says specifically, “You will pursue your enemies, and they will fall by the sword before you.”

The letter adds, “These examples are inconsistent with your claim that you converted to Christianity after discovering it is a ‘peaceful’ religion, as opposed to Islam which contains violence, rage and revenge.”

The Iranian man's application for asylum, which was entered at around the same time he converted to Christianity (he knows his own country's laws), was denied Tuesday.

A spokesperson for the Home Office told the Independent that this rejection notice is not “in accordance” with the department’s usual approach to asylum claims based on religious persecution. The decision is more likely a case of anti-asylum fervor than a case of anti-Christian zeal, legal expert Conor James McKinney told the Independent, saying the U.K. immigration agency has a tendency to “come up with any reason they can to refuse asylum.”

“The Home Office is notorious for coming up with any reason they can to refuse asylum and this looks like a particularly creative example, but not necessarily a systemic outbreak of anti-Christian sentiment in the department,” McKinney said.

The number of asylum applications granted by the British government last year dropped by 26 percent, the New York Times reports.

Even so, it’s hard not to think there’s a trend in the U.K. of government officials taking anti-Christian positions. The same week this Iranian national had his asylum application denied, British newsrooms revealed that law enforcement officials are investigating a Roman Catholic reporter for “misgendering” a transgendered person. This all comes after the Alfie Evans tragedy, where the state forcibly blocked Catholic parents from removing their dying infant son from a British hospital so that they could seek alternative, life-saving methods elsewhere. The child died later after the hospital took him off life support, against the express wishes of his parents.

A similar story played out one year earlier when the state denied yet another Catholic family the opportunity to remove their dying infant son, Charlie Gard, from a British hospital to seek life-saving treatment overseas. The child later died in the hospital, his parents’ final request that he be allowed to spend his final moments in his home also denied.

What I’m trying to say is: If you’re a Christian living in the U.K., now might be a really good time to think about emigrating to the land of the free and the home of the brave, where the biggest nuisance for people of faith is an overabundance of options for worship.

Train sounds, an odd voice, and fun with foam and numbers

Texto completo: CHOOS WISELY
Reddit's “Too Afraid to Ask" forum is usually fertile turf/muck for cultivating NSFW inquiries that weigh on the private mind, but this week it was an aggressively family-friendly question that sent it off the rails: “How many 'chuggas' come before the 'choo choo'?" Thousands sounded off, revealing startling disparities across national chugga tallies. Amtrak 's own Twitter polling revealed a 36 percent preference for the double-chugga (which seems prema-choo to me), and a surprisingly high 31 percent opting for the octochugga — a la the “Batman" theme (which just seems a little much, don't you think?). All this despite the obvious answer being four. Don't @ me.
LOW BLOWS
Elsewhere in deep Internet mysteries, Twitter has been trying its collective best to get to the bottom of Theranos founder and V05 Hot Oil Treatment before picture Elizabeth Holmes 's freaky low speaking voice, which many believe is just another wholesale fabrication from the disgraced tech exec and nonblinking turtleneck model. My favorite take on Holmes's chronically mislabeled baritone comes from Jezebel: “Elizabeth Holmes's chosen fake voice, meant to project gravitas and business acumen, is the same voice that I (and maybe you) put on when making fun of very stupid men." It's also the voice I used as a teenager when “my dad" needed to phone the principal.
EXTRA FOAM
New Hampshire resident Korey Nolan surfed into Internet notoriety this week atop an “award-winning surfboard that he custom built using nearly 1,000 polystyrene foam Dunkin' cups." The board, which took hundreds of hours to build, won him second place in the 2018 Creators & Innovators Upcycle Contest. Not to be outdone, Dunkin' Donuts introduced a new polystyrene surfboard cozy that fits perfectly over the other surfboard in case it's too cold to hold. Earth declined to comment.
SIGNS OF THE TIMES
Fishing around for lurid tales of bizarre felonies committed by random dudes in the state of Florida has long been a favorite Internet pastime (search “Florida man" to see why, and thank the state's Sunshine Law for those wide open public records). But a new viral call to Google “Florida Man" plus your date of birth has created something like an aggressively dysfunctional zodiac . My Florida man, for instance, was just sentenced to jail for assaulting a McDonald's worker because they were all out of straws. (I'm assuming he was also a Gemini.)

Legal March Madness bets placed

Texto completo: The dirt track is empty and gray, like the sky. Rain blows in on the wind, stops, then starts again. The paddocks are empty, the horses gone.
None of it matters. At the Meadowlands Racetrack a crowd is gathering, the grandstand filling up. The building's southern wall is all windows, but no one looks outside. Today everyone is inside, in this bar, which looks like no other bar in the world, its curved black walls soaring four stories tall and hung with huge television screens. The largest one measures 20 feet across.
Nevermind the big TVs. Those are for fans and amateurs. Here the action happens on small screens, like the automated gambling kiosks that circle the room, their bright LED screens reading "BET HERE."
It's happening on Anthony Mea's smartphone and on his Macbook Air laptop, which sits open beside his bucket of Bud Lite cans. Above Mea, a big TV screen shows Darius Perry, a sophomore guard for the Louisville University Cardinals, jumping on a basketball court in Des Moines, Iowa, 1,100 miles away.
It's the first quarter of the first game on the first day of the NCAA basketball tournament in 2019, the first time anyone outside Las Vegas may bet legally on college sports.
Perry shoots. He sinks a three-pointer.
Mea peers into his screens. They contain blurs of numbers, spreadsheets of tallies and percentages refreshed every millisecond by seven different online gambling data companies. As Perry turns to play defense on that court in Des Moines, here in the Meadowlands a box on Mea's spreadsheet blinks from white to yellow. This indicates that one of the data companies Mea tracks, called Pinnacle, believes Perry's basket nudged the odds of victory just a smidge in Louisville's favor. The other six companies disagree. On Mea's computer, their columns remain clear white.
To a fan watching on the big screen it was just another three-pointer, a lovely parabola in a game of lovely parabolas.
To Mea, watching on his little screen, it was actionable intelligence.
"If I were betting online right now, I could bet that spread" between Pinnacle and all the other data companies, said Mea, 24, who is from Hoboken. "You look for discrepancies between the houses."
Who needs horses galloping in the rain? Who needs Darius Perry's perfect wrist-flick follow-through? What good is the beauty of sport, all those wide-open views of people striving against the outermost edge of human ability?
Beauty cannot be monetized.
Discrepancies between the houses of gambling can be.
This is what makes people like Anthony Mea money. This, now, is what sport is all about.
"There are so many intricacies. It's very analytical," Mea said. "I try to keep emotions to a minimum."
Down with love. Up with data. There's been a lot of keeping emotions to a minimum lately in the worlds of college and professional sports. Last May the United States Supreme Court struck down a law that effectively barred sports gambling in every state but Nevada. The big sports leagues fought the change for years, arguing that legalized gambling could tarnish their sports by giving coaches, players and fans strong incentives to cheat.
In the end, the opposition seemed mostly symbolic. By 2014, Adam Silver, commissioner of the National Basketball Association, signed an op-ed in The New York Times supporting sports gambling legalization, so long as his association earned a cut.
"I believe that sports betting should be brought out of the underground and into the sunlight where it can be appropriately monitored and regulated," Silver wrote.
This Thursday, the first day anyone over the age of 21 could legally bet on March Madness basketball games in New Jersey, the fans at Meadowlands Racetrack were in unanimous agreement.
"It should be legalized because it's going to happen anyway," said Alexander Cohen, 27, a White Plains, New York, resident who took the day off from work as a commercial real estate broker. "This is the land of the free. Why not bring it out of the back alley so it can be regulated and monetized?"
A few steps away stood Tom Sommer, a sports marketing consultant. When Sommer watches Darius Perry shoot a three-pointer, what he notices is not Perry's excellent form. Instead he might spot the famous Oreo cookie logo, which appeared for a few seconds on the LED screen at center court.
"How much is that worth?" Sommer said, pointing to the screen. "Or the Budweiser sign behind home plate, what's the value of that? I use adaptive metrics to help advertisers and content providers place a value" on such things.
To a man like Sommer, what was happening Tuesday in the bowels of the Meadowlands grandstand was not an overwhelming amount of basketball on overwhelmingly large television screens. It was the spear tip, the dawning day of a new era in sport, an era when eyeballs are tracked and traded and monetized across a panoply of platforms including linear television, internet streams, social media and in-stadium ads.
For a man like Sommer, then, sports gambling is great because it attracts eyeballs to screens. Big screens, little screens — it doesn't really matter.
"The overall consumption numbers across all platforms are up exponentially across all sports," due largely to the spread of legalized sports gambling, said Sommer, who marveled at all the opportunities for monetization he sees. "You have these up-and-coming properties like the drone racing league getting half a million people watching a championship. That's more than the evening news in some markets!"
The new and the old Outside the bar on Thursday was Preston Smith, who wore a fitted black leather jacket, black slacks with a hard crease down the front, blue-and-green argyle socks and smooth leather shoes. He sat in a plastic seat facing the gray dirt track, but he did not look outside.
Instead he looked down, at his phone. It contained a color-coded spreadsheet.
Green indicated bets about which Smith felt highly confident. Orange bets seemed just OK; yellow bets seemed risky. It was 11:15 a.m. Smith would not stay to watch the games. Instead he would place his bets, leave by noon, and catch an Uber ride back to Manhattan and his job as a lawyer.
Which is not to say that Smith lives entirely without emotion.
"I never bet on Carolina games, because it's too intense," said Smith, 31, who lives in Washington, D.C. "I'm a wreck anyway. If I put money on it, it's too much."
Across from Smith, Anthony LaBlaca sprinkled croutons into his cup of lentil soup. He wore a purple baseball cap printed with the words "2011 Hambletonian," a souvenir from the famous horse race that happens here every year.
Sure, LaBlaca likes to gamble. At age 87, he believes it keeps his mind sharp. But gambling's cold calculus is not the reason he comes to the track every day.
"I know the horses. I don't know the sports," LaBlaca, a Passaic resident, said as he watched these new sports betters walk toward the bar, eyes locked on their phones. "This place is therapy for me. I got all my friends here."

‘The Simpsons’ predicted its acquisition by Disney in 1998

Texto completo: “The Simpsons” may be the most prescient show on television.

In a November 1998 episode, it predicted Disney’s acquisition of what is now 21st Century Fox, a $71.3 billion deal that was finalized Wednesday.
Al Jean, a writer for the show, told the New York Times that it was just an idea for the type of deal that could occur. “It happens,” he said. “There's always mergers. It seemed logical, you know?”

“The Simpsons,” which airs on Fox, has a long record of eerily predicting the future, from Super Bowl wins to the presidency of Donald Trump. But maybe its prediction of Disney’s dominance is not so surprising.

In addition to 21st Century Fox, Disney now owns ABC, Lucasfilm (of the “Star Wars” movies), Marvel, and Pixar. As part of the company’s move toward a media monopoly, a little $70 billion purchase was just another step.

The growth may be good for business, but Disney's variety may be getting out of hand. The top of the Walt Disney Company website now shows a mix of Marvel heroes, classic characters Mickey Mouse and Woody, and Bart Simpson.

Texto completo: Liberal New York Times columnist David Leonhardt is utterly baffled over the lack of coherent immigration policy coming from Democrats.

Here is a hint for him: Democrats are not being honest when they say they are “for border security.” The mainstream of the party believes in open borders to anyone who can make it. Not only have they explicitly said it, but they’ve also explicitly acted on it.

Leonhardt wrote in a column Wednesday that it remains unclear “exactly what the Democrat Party’s new position on immigration is.” He said there were questions he wanted answered by Democrats, like, “What kind of border security do you believe in?”; “Do you believe that immigrants who enter this country illegally should be allowed to stay?”; and “What do you believe should happen to future levels of legal immigration?”

It’s true that Democrats are almost never confronted with any serious questions about immigration outside of, “What do you think about Trump’s racist rhetoric?” But if you watch them talk long enough, their position usually reveals itself quite clearly.

After the Trump administration rolled out a new policy for the legal port of entry in San Diego, that any migrant seeking asylum from Mexico must wait south of the border for their court hearing, then-outgoing-Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Ill., said everyone claiming asylum should be allowed in. “Why should they have to wait on the other side of the border when they could be victimized again?” he said in December on CNN.

Gutierrez certainly knows the problem with allowing all asylum seekers in, very few of whom have a legitimate asylum claim. After being turned lose into the U.S., a sizable portion of them don’t bother showing up for their hearing. CNN reported just Wednesday on a court hearing for 16 migrants who have been waiting in Mexico. Four of them didn’t show up for it. The number of no-shows gets close to 40 percent, meaning thousands of illegal immigrants escape into U.S. neighborhoods every year with no one knowing who they are or what they're going to do here.

Gutierrez doesn’t care, and his is the Democrat position on immigration.

A few days later and again on CNN, incoming freshman Rep. Xochitl Torres Small, D-N.M, said the first responsibility border patrol agents have is not to keep unknown people from crossing into the country, but to function as nurses and babysitters for them.

“So, we have to prioritize, of course, medical equipment, as well as personnel, appropriate facilities for these families that are being detained," she said, "because that’s important to save childrens' lives, to make sure that detainees are safe and healthy.”

Beto O’Rourke is considered a viable contender for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination. Not only is he opposed to building more border barrier, but he wants to tear down the existing structures.

California Sen. Kamala Harris, another 2020 candidate, sees similarities between the way Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents operate and the Ku Klux Klan.

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., the new unofficial leader of the House Democratic caucus, says that ICE should be abolished altogether.

I hope this answers some of David Leonhardt’s urgent questions. Democrats aren’t completely evasive on the subject of immigration. They’re openly in support of open borders, if you just let them talk long enough.

Former ABC News anchor: Hell yeah, media see Trump as the enemy

Texto completo: Some of the most powerful newsrooms in the country clearly see President Trump as the enemy, according to former longtime ABC News anchor Ted Koppel.

It’s right there in their coverage, he explained this month during an interview with Marvin Kalb at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.

“I’m terribly concerned that when you talk about the New York Times these days, when you talk about the Washington Post these days, we’re not talking about the New York Times of 50 years ago. We are not talking about the Washington Post of 50 years ago,” the former "Nightline" anchor said. “We’re talking about organizations that I believe have, in fact, decided as organizations that Donald J. Trump is bad for the United States.”

“We have things appearing on the front page of the New York Times right now that never would have appeared 50 years ago. Analysis, commentary on the front page,” Koppel continued,” he added.

That’s quite a thing for someone in the news media “family” to allege. Huge, in fact.

“So [Trump’s] perception that the establishment press is out to get him doesn’t mean that great journalism is not being done. It is. But the notion that most of us look upon Donald Trump as being an absolute fiasco — he’s not mistaken in that perception and he’s not mistaken when so many of the liberal media, for example, described themselves as belonging to the Resistance,” Koppel continued.

He added, “What does that mean? That’s not said by people who consider themselves reporters, objective reporters of facts. That’s the kind of language that’s used by people who genuinely believe, and I rather suspect with some justification, that Donald Trump is bad for the United States and they’re betting that the sooner he’s out of office the better they will like it. Whether that happens by virtue of indictment, impeachment or election, we’ll see. … We are not the reservoir of objectivity that I think we were.”

Almost as interesting as the comments themselves is the fact that this interview took place on March 7, and practically no one (myself included) heard anything about it until this week.

It took for a conservative media watchdog group, NewsBusters, to hunt down the interview and bring it to light. Since then, major newsrooms, including the Washington Post, Fox News, and Poynter, have reported on Koppel’s remarks. That’s an awfully curious thing, considering there’s usually no shortage of immediate news coverage for the various musings of retired journalists.

Until this morning, I knew more about what disgraced former news anchor Dan Rather, who CNN laughably characterizes as an “iconic broadcaster,” had to say last weekend about the president and propaganda than I knew about what Koppel had to say much earlier this month about major newsrooms’ obvious headlong descent into anti-Trumpist ideology.

Just an oversight, I'm sure.

Happy 50th, Krannert Center

Texto completo: For half a century, central Illinois residents have been counting their blessings that forward-looking people -- and University of Illinois alums -- Herman Krannert and Max Abramovitz combined to bring the UI a splendid performing arts center that is welcoming, beautiful and functional.
Its nativity was difficult -- two years late and about 50 percent over budget -- but once the Krannert Center for the Performing Arts opened on April 19, 1969, and all the problems were worked out, enthusiasts of the performing arts knew what a rare gift they had received with the huge theater complex two blocks from the University of Illinois Quad.
The $21 million center was a gift mostly from 1912 UI graduate Herman Krannert, a wealthy manufacturer of shipping containers and cardboard boxes, and his wife, Ellnora. It was designed by another UI grad, Max Abramovitz, a member of the Class of 1929 who also was architect for the Assembly Hall, a United Nations building, David Geffen Hall at Lincoln Center and a host of other significant structures.
Abramovitz called the complex an "acropolis on the prairie," which wasn't far from the truth. Its design with four interior theater spaces sharing a common lobby, along with convenient underground parking, was hailed as ingenious by The New York Times. Its acoustics were praised by symphony orchestras around the world. And the Chicago Tribune said that "for sheer size, sophistication and sprawl, no arts complex in the United States approaches the Krannert Center for the Performing Arts."
In its 50 years, Krannert Center has brought many of the world's greatest performers to Urbana and has served as a laboratory for generations of university and high school students to learn theater, music, dance and more. Herman Krannert's gift keeps giving, and residents of central Illinois, in particular, are forever grateful.
A 50th anniversary celebration of the Krannert complex will be held the weekend of April 12-14 with tours, performances and special forums and discussions about the center and the future of performance arts in higher education.

Texto completo: Question: True or false? All those tales in recent newspapers of rich and famous parents, like actors Lori Laughlin and Felicity Huffman, participating in programs to get their children into name colleges are based in California.
Answer: False. In the New York Times this week was a story of a Peoria, Ill., parent attending a 2012 meeting in Champaign that was led by William Singer, the man later accused of running a program of selling dreams and prosperous futures by getting children into prospective "name" colleges. Besides the rich and famous, Singer tried to cultivate relationships with, among others, typical middle-class families in Illinois, the Times story said.

Apple News Service Will Include Wall Street Journal

Texto completo: SAN FRANCISCO -- The Wall Street Journal plans to join a new paid subscription news service run by Apple, according to two people familiar with the plans, as other publishers chafe at the terms that the Silicon Valley company is demanding of its partners.
Other major publishers, including The New York Times and The Washington Post, have opted out of joining the subscription service, said the people, who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the plans.
Apple and The Wall Street Journal plan to announce the deal Monday at a media event at Apple's headquarters in Cupertino, Calif. The event is intended to draw attention to the company's bet on news and entertainment, including a streaming service that will put Apple in direct competition with Netflix, Amazon and HBO.
The service, described by some as a "Netflix for news," will offer access to a new paid tier of the Apple News app. Through that tier, readers will be able to consume articles from hundreds of participating magazines and news outlets. The app's free tier will still let people read a smattering of select articles from a wide variety of publishers.
To persuade publishers to join the paid service, Apple executives have said the scale of Apple News, which is installed on every iPhone sold to consumers, could introduce millions of new customers to their content.
But the most recent terms that Apple is offering to publishers ask for a cut of roughly half of the subscription revenue involved in the service, the people said. Apple has also asked publishers to give unlimited access to all their content, which has caused concern among potential partners, they said. A subscription is expected to cost $10 a month.
The deal's terms have caused some publishers to recoil, as a 50 percent cut is higher than the 30 percent that Apple usually takes from apps and subscriptions sold through its App Store. Publishers are also concerned that they won't have access to important data about the consumers -- credit cards, email addresses and other subscriber information -- as part of the deal.
Representatives from Apple, The Times, The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post declined to comment. Some deal terms were previously reported by Recode and The Wall Street Journal.
As sales of Apple's marquee product, the iPhone, start to slow, the company is expanding into different software-based businesses, which typically have higher profit margins and do not rely on supply chains and manufacturing.
Publishers have also been seeking to expand beyond their core subscriber bases, finding new audiences across nontraditional platforms and striking deals with tech companies. Apple has teamed up with news organizations on its Apple News product for years, offering select content to consumers for free.
But publishers have grown wary of some partnerships in recent years, as past relationships with companies like Facebook, Medium and others have soured. In the past, Facebook has inked deals with publishers to fund or support new initiatives, only to quickly change plans and yank support from one year to the next.

Is scooter data too personal to track?

Autor: Nelson, Laura J. 

Información de publicación: Los Angeles Times ; Los Angeles, Calif. [Los Angeles, Calif]. 21 Mar 2019: A.1.

Texto completo: The abrupt arrival of thousands of electric scooters in Los Angeles last year has already forced public, sometimes ugly, disagreements about how the city's street and sidewalk space should be used.
Now, Los Angeles' launching of a one-year program legalizing the vehicles, has made them the focus of a fight about data privacy.
Under new city rules, every company with a permit to rent out scooters or shared bicycles must send data to transportation officials on every trip the vehicles make.

That location data will help the city determine which companies are flouting new operating rules that cap the number of vehicles and restrict where they can be parked, officials said.
Tracking them electronically will also be faster and cheaper than paying employees to look for rogue vehicles blocking sidewalks or wheelchair ramps.
"The public has to be reassured that there is somebody who is keeping a close eye," said Seleta Reynolds, the Transportation Department's general manager, who is overseeing the initiative.
The problem, opponents say, is that Los Angeles wants to keep too close an eye.
Uber, which operates Jump scooters, and several data privacy organizations have said the city's policy constitutes government surveillance and would yield far more information about bicyclists and scooter riders than is available on drivers or transit commuters.
Many scooter trips in Los Angeles are tourist joyrides, but public officials say the zippy electric devices could become a meaningful transportation alternative that helps commuters get to transit stops and run errands without driving.
The city will require companies to share information on the start point, end point and travel time of each bike or scooter trip within 24 hours after it ends, and whether the vehicle entered zones where riding or parking are restricted.
The data would not include a rider's name, but even in sprawling metropolitan areas, paths between home, work and school are typically unique, experts say. Someone with basic coding skills and access to the data could easily connect a trip to an individual person.
"This data is incredibly, incredibly sensitive," said Jeremy Gillula, the technology projects director for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a San Francisco digital rights group.
The vast trove of information could reveal many personal details of regular riders -- such as whom they're dating or where they worship -- and could be misused if it fell into the wrong hands, the nonprofit Center for Democracy and Technology told the city in a letter.
The New York Times recently analyzed a database containing the movements of more than 1 million cellphones and easily identified individual people, including an aide to New York Mayor Bill DeBlasio and a middle-school teacher whose phone reported her home address, her workplace and the location of her Weight Watchers meetings.
The scooter and bicycle data will be classified as sensitive and confidential, which means information on individual rides will not be published on the city's open data website or subject to public records requests, Reynolds said.
The data would be provided to police with a warrant and could be revealed in response to a subpoena, the city said.
Some form of the data will also be shared with other city agencies "at the level of aggregation that we think they need," Reynolds said, including city planners and the sanitation workers tasked with removing scooters from sidewalks, wheelchair ramps and other rights of way.
Uber spokesman Davis White said the city has not answered "fundamental questions" about how the it will safeguard the data. Uber is willing to share some data with L.A., he said, "so long as user privacy is protected."
The city has urged California regulators to adopt a similar model for trips made in Uber and Lyft cars, which would reveal vast amounts of information on the companies' operations statewide -- data that cities badly want to review but that the companies have jealously guarded.
The dispute highlights the lack of trust between cities and transportation companies that have typically moved into new markets without asking permission, working with local officials or sharing details on their operations.
"I would trust Uber as far as I could throw one of their cars, and you can quote me on that," Gillula said. But that doesn't mean their concerns are without merit, he added.
The city plans to require companies to submit ride data starting April 15.
Uber is pushing for a model that would require the companies to share less-detailed information and has urged the Transportation Department to submit the plan to the City Council for debate.
Allowing companies to summarize their own data is akin to "letting the fox watch the henhouse," Reynolds said, adding that she is "somewhat skeptical" that the companies would provide accurate information on their own.
Uber infamously used a program called Greyball that served up a fake version of the ride-hailing app to regulatory officials to stymie enforcement efforts.
Seattle, which had an early study of bike-share data, found that the companies' self-reported information had a "high margin of error," Reynolds said.
Aggregated data could also pose problems for L.A.'s pilot program, which caps companies at 3,000 scooters or bikes citywide but offers a bonus of up to 7,500 more if they are deployed in low-income neighborhoods, she said. Tracking that compliance will require granular data that is "defensible and credible."
"None of the things they've outlined in terms of transportation planning or enforcement or oversight requires keeping a record of where everyone has traveled," said Kevin Webb, co-director of Shared Streets, a nonprofit organization that helps cities and companies share transportation data and has accepted funding from Uber and Lyft.
One option, he said, would be to create a confidential database in which trip data could be stored and stripped of some identifying information before being sent to the city.
The database would record who shared the data and what information was shared, creating a log that could be audited.
"The city is framing this as a debate with the companies," Webb said.
"But really, it's between the city and all the citizens who are customers whose data and lives are being swept up in this fight."

Texto completo: Iowa Rep. Steve King, known for making controversial comments, appeared to avoid answering a question Tuesday about whether he believed a white society is superior to a nonwhite society.
King was speaking at a town hall event in Algona when a woman asked the question.
"Do you think a white society is superior to a nonwhite society?" said 63-year-old Mary Lavelle, according to the New York Times.
"I don't have an answer for that. That's so hypothetical," King responded, before continuing.
Steve King: 'I have nothing to apologize for,' plans to seek re-election despite controversies
"America is not a white society," the Washington Post reported King saying. "It's never been a completely white society. We came here and joined the Native Americans, who were here in many times numbers greater than ours. "
King, a Republican, has been in Congress since 2003. A recent statement in which he questioned why phrases like "white supremacy" were offensive caused House Republicans to condemn him in a near-unanimous resolution passed in January. House Republican leaders also removed him from his committee assignments.
King made the comments in an interview with the New York Times.

More: Iowa's Steve King has a history of controversial remarks. Here are some that riled people up.
“White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization — how did that language become offensive?” King said in the Times interview. “Why did I sit in classes teaching me about the merits of our history and our civilization?”
King voted for the resolution condemning himself, saying his comments had not come across as intended.

DATA BREACHES ESCALATE

Texto completo: The headlines are constant: Millions of accounts hacked. Health and financial data stolen. Personal information shared widely with advertisers and technology companies. New Jersey is not immune.
More than 4 million New Jersey accounts were affected by security breaches in 2017, according to the most recent state estimates, and a Pew survey published that year found that a majority of Americans have personally experienced some sort of data theft or fraud.
Welcome to the new normal.
Against that backdrop, New Jersey is starting to grapple with some of the thorniest questions of the digital age. Yes, consumers can take steps to protect themselves online, as outlined by the state's cybersecurity unit. But what responsibilities do companies have in collecting your personal information? Who controls that data? And what should be done if it's compromised?
State policymakers are debating those issues right now. New Jersey law already requires companies to tell customers when information such as Social Security or credit card numbers is hacked, but a bill on Gov. Phil Murphy's desk would expand that list to include things like email addresses and passwords, which are often all that is needed to break into an online account.
Other measures working their way through the Legislature would allow online users to opt out of having their personal information shared with third parties and require mobile apps to better inform users of how their location data may be used.
The reexamination of New Jersey's laws governing cybersecurity and online privacy comes in the wake of numerous high-profile data breaches — affecting Marriott, Yahoo, Panera, Under Armour, Target, Equifax and Home Depot, to name just a few companies — and as incidents like the Cambridge Analytica scandal involving the unauthorized use of Facebook profiles have made people more sensitive to how tech firms monetize user-generated information.
This month, The New York Times reported that Facebook is under criminal investigation for data-sharing deals it made with scores of other technology companies that provided intrusive access to users' personal information.
Dozens of other states are looking to update their consumer protection policies, too. At least 31 states, for example, considered legislation to amend existing security breach laws last year, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
"It is absolutely a best practice for states to be reviewing their current data breach notification laws and any of the laws that are around identity crimes and cybersecurity and things of that nature because this is such a dynamic space," said Eva Velasquez, president and CEO of the Identity Theft Resource Center, a nonprofit that offers free assistance to victims of identity theft and provides educational resources about online fraud and security.
Her organization tracked 1,244 security breaches that occurred throughout the U.S. in 2018, exposing a staggering 447 million records — more than double the number of records exposed the previous year.
The proposals in New Jersey could have sweeping effects on consumers and companies alike.
The measure closest to becoming law, S-52, would force companies to disclose data breaches involving an expanded definition of "personal information." The bipartisan bill was approved unanimously in the Legislature and now awaits a signature or veto by Murphy, a Democrat.
Current state law mandates that companies tell customers when their driver's license numbers, Social Security numbers, account numbers or credit or debit card numbers have been compromised. The bill would expand that list to include user names, email addresses and passwords or security questions and answers that could be used to gain access to an online account.
"You take someone's user name and password — that can already be linked to their credit card account" on many websites, said Sen. Troy Singleton, D-Burlington, a sponsor of the bill. With notification of the breach, however, consumers can potentially take defensive measures or at least monitor the compromised account more closely, he said.
Another bill that has yet to receive a hearing in committee, A-3541, gets to the heart of another big question after security breaches: When do customers have the right to know that their information was compromised?
Current law simply says disclosures must be made "in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay." The bill would accelerate that timeline, requiring companies to disclose a breach to customers within five days of discovering it unless it is still under investigation by the company or law enforcement.
Other proposals would change what data companies have control of in the first place.
One measure, A-4974, would require mobile apps that collect users' GPS data to share how that data is used and require users to opt in to the disclosure of that data to third parties, such as advertisers.
Another measure, S-2834, is modeled on language from the European Union's sweeping new data protection legislation, known as the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR. It would require commercial websites and services to tell users all the "personally identifiable information" they collect and give users a chance to opt out of having that data shared with third parties.
A similar provision was included in the California Consumer Privacy Act, which was also modeled on the GDPR and signed into law last year.
Those bills, which have been approved in one committee but must clear several more procedural hurdles before becoming law, have encountered resistance from companies whose business models depend on the collection and sale of personal information.
At a hearing in Trenton last month, Gerard Keegan, vice president for state legislative affairs with CTIA, a trade association for the wireless communications industry, argued that the proposals would have unintended consequences and could undercut many of the products and services that people enjoy.
"Many news sites, online content providers, apps provide those services and products free of charge because they are supported by advertising," Keegan said. "To force those companies to still provide those services and products to consumers who won't share identifying information with advertisers is wrong and will possibly lead to those companies' being shut down in the state."
The future of the bills remains uncertain, but their introduction reflects a growing awareness among residents and lawmakers about how information shared online can be used, abused or stolen.
Asked for her suggestions about how people can improve the security of their personal information, Velasquez, of the Identity Theft Resource Center, emphasized the need to think critically about where to share such information in the first place.
"Once you release data or provide data to an entity, the ball is now in their court to be good stewards of that data," she said.
"Make that decision carefully. Give it the thought and provide it the internal weight that it deserves."

As Disney Gets Gigantic, Ripples May Also Be Big

Texto completo: LOS ANGELES -- "Everything the light touches is our kingdom."
It's a line from Disney's "The Lion King," spoken by Mufasa to young Simba as they sit atop Pride Rock. And on Wednesday morning, just after midnight on the East Coast, it seemed to describe the Walt Disney Company itself, as the conglomerate closed its $71.3 billion acquisition of 21st Century Fox assets. It is now an entertainment colossus the size of which the world has never seen.
The ripple effects may not become clear for years. Analysts say that Disney could force smaller studios to merge as they scramble to compete. It will have greater leverage over theater owners when it comes to box office splits. And Disney's plans to use Fox content to forcefully move into streaming could slow the growth of Netflix.
"This deal definitely reshapes the landscape," said Michael Nathanson, a leading media analyst.
Disney now owns most of Rupert Murdoch's former empire, including the 20th Century Fox movie and television studio, which includes the "X-Men," "Avatar" and "Simpsons" franchises; Blue Sky, the "Ice Age" animation studio that is based in Connecticut; the National Geographic and FX cable networks; most of the streaming service Hulu; and Star, a fast-growing television-service provider in India.
Disney had been a mere behemoth, dominating sports television through ESPN, controlling the global theme park business and running Hollywood's No. 1 movie operation, with studios that include Marvel, Pixar and Lucasfilm. But the company decided that it needed to bulk up even more as the tech giants aggressively moved into Hollywood. The competition now includes Apple, which is scheduled to unveil its television and movie plans on Monday.
"This is an extraordinary and historic moment for us," Robert A. Iger, Disney's chief executive, said in a statement on Tuesday.
Mr. Iger has staked his legacy on this deal, and he had to fend off an aggressive play by Comcast on two continents to gain control of Mr. Murdoch's trove. (Mr. Iger ultimately lost Sky, the British pay-television company.) The acquisition is the largest in Disney's 96-year history, dwarfing even the 1995 purchase of Capital Cities / ABC. That cost $19 billion (about $32 billion in today's money) and, because it included ESPN, served as a growth engine for Disney for two decades.
The Fox assets are meant to do the same for Disney in the years ahead. Disney is now trying to become less dependent on cable channels like ESPN, which are in slow, steady decline owing to cord-cutting. Instead, Disney has decided to move into the rapidly growing realm of online video, a direct-to-consumer business defined by Netflix. Mr. Iger believes that the Fox assets will enhance that plan, which includes a streaming service called Disney+ later this year.
"The pace of disruption has only hastened," Mr. Iger told The New York Times in an interview when the deal was announced. "This will allow us to greatly accelerate our direct-to-consumer strategy, which is our highest priority."
The challenges are daunting. Mr. Iger and his lieutenants need to persuade investors to start viewing Disney more like a technology company, where near-term financial turbulence is often overlooked. Integrating the Fox assets will bring headaches that include substantial layoffs -- analysts project more than 3,000 -- and the melding of two starkly different corporate cultures. When the deal was announced in December 2017, James L. Brooks, a creator of "The Simpsons," posted an image on Twitter that showed an angry Homer Simpson strangling Mickey Mouse.
To win approval from antitrust regulators around the world, Disney had to agree to modest concessions.
It is already deep in the process of selling Fox's 22 regional sports channels, a move required by the Justice Department. The Yankees teamed with Amazon this month, for instance, to buy the YES Network, which serves the New York metropolitan area, for roughly $3.5 billion. To appease European regulators, Disney agreed to divest a stake in A+E Networks, which include the History channel. (Disney will retain 50 percent ownership of the division in the United States; Hearst owns the other half.)
The final sticking points came from Brazil and Mexico. Regulators in those countries are forcing Disney to sell Fox Sports, a competitor to ESPN that holds extensive rights to televise soccer matches. Brazil's antitrust regulator, Cade, said in a statement that operating both channels would give Disney too much control of the sports TV market in the country. Mexico's telecommunications regulator, IFT, held a similar view and added stipulations about Disney's ownership of the National Geographic and Nat Geo Wild channels.
At Disney's annual meeting this month, Mr. Iger said the 20th Century Fox and Fox Searchlight labels -- trumpet fanfares included -- would continue to exist. That decision pleased Hollywood, but it could lead to consumer confusion since Mr. Murdoch retained ownership of the Fox broadcast network, a chain of local Fox television stations and his crown jewel, Fox News. Those businesses, along with the FS1 sports channel, were rolled into a new publicly traded company, Fox Corporation, on Tuesday.
Paul D. Ryan, the former Republican congressman from Wisconsin who served as speaker of the House from October 2015 to January 2019, joined the Fox board on Tuesday. Other board members include Mr. Murdoch and Roland A. Hernandez, a former chief executive of Telemundo. Mr. Murdoch's oldest son, Lachlan, serves as the new company's chief executive.
The Murdochs are expected to receive roughly $12 billion in proceeds from the Disney deal, according to Bloomberg. Shareholders in the assets that were sold to Disney had the option to accept Disney shares or cash out. Disney said on Friday that, based on initial results of that process, holders of about 52 percent of shares asked for cash and 37 percent asked for Disney shares. The balance did not make a request.

The shadowy, legal world of college consultants

Texto completo: For prices up to $1.5 million, parents can buy a five-year, full-service package of college admissions consulting from a company in New York City called Ivy Coach.
The service begins as early as eighth grade, as students are guided through choosing courses and extra-curriculars most likely to find favor in college admissions offices. They must find a "singular hook," said Brian Taylor, the company's managing director - a way to stand out when high grades, sports and community service are no longer enough.
The students receive intensive preparation for the SAT or ACT, both "coachable exams," Taylor explained. Then they receive close editing of their college essays, akin to how a screenwriter might work with an agent or studio executive.
And all of it is legal. "Is that unfair? That the privileged can pay?" Taylor asked. "Yes. But that's how the world works."
When the government last week unveiled federal indictments of dozens of parents, college administrators and coaches, it revealed an array of corrupt and illegal admissions practices. But there is also a perfectly legal world of private college counseling and test prep that caters to parents eager to give their children an edge in the cutthroat world of college admissions.
The education consultants industry has tens of thousands of practitioners, serving both students and schools, according to research group IBIS-World, which estimated the sector's annual revenue in 2018 at $1.9 billion.
Parents might pay $300 for a standard, hour-long consultation with an admissions expert or donate tens of millions to schools, with the hope of winning special consideration for their child's application.
Revelations about these practices risks breeding more cynicism toward American higher education at a time when elite college admissions are already under the microscope, with multiple schools facing inquiries into their affirmative action and legacy admission policies.
And they reveal the degree to which parents up and down the income ladder have become fixated on college acceptance as a ticket to their children's financial security.
"Private college consulting is almost like the Wild West," said Alexis Redding, a visiting scholar at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, who has written about the "extreme pressure" the college admissions race can put on students and families.
While many consultants adhere to optional ethical guidelines set out by national professional associations, some consultants do not, she said.
The federal indictment "isn't surprising to anyone who has either studied the high stakes world of private admissions or private consulting," Redding said. "The scale and details and celebrity are surprising."
With the many legal means to seek preferential treatment for one's offspring, from big donations to expensive tutors, the Hollywood stars and business moguls named in Tuesday's indictment seemingly had other ways to exert influence over the process.
But in recent years the costs of ensuring special treatment for an application have moved beyond comfortable reach even for the rich. A donation to an Ivy-caliber school would have to be valued at $10 million or more to earn an applicant truly special consideration beyond their merits, according to several experienced college admissions consultants.
Steven Mercer, a private college consultant based in Santa Monica, California, called $10 million "an entry-level gift that might not even get the attention of the admission office."
He added, "You have to sometimes go quite a bit higher."
Taylor of Ivy Coach agreed that even after a $10 million gift, a student's application would not be greeted with "no questions asked."
"It's not guaranteed," he said.
Certainty appears to be what parents were seeking when they hired William Singer, the consultant who pleaded guilty last week to charges of racketeering, money laundering and obstruction of justice. "I created a guarantee," Singer said in a Boston courtroom.
In conversations with parents recorded by federal authorities, Singer styled his services as a first-class cabin for tech titans, rich investors and other luminaries trying to lock down a scarce spot at a prized school, such as Yale, Georgetown and the University of Southern California. Court papers said he promised to slot them in as athlstes - with fabricated or embellished records - and on schools' "VIP lists"
"What we do is we help the wealthiest families in the U.S. get their kids into school," he told Gordon R. Caplan, co-chairman of global law firm Willkie Farr & Gallagher, in a June 2018 phone call recorded by authorities. Prosecutors say Caplan paid $75,000 to fake his daughter's standardized test score.
According to court papers, Singer also promised parents that their children would get an ACT score in the 30s, a 1400 or better SAT score or a spot on the University of Southern California water polo team.
Consultants who abide by the law can never offer a promise of admission to a specific school, said Taylor of Ivy Coach, no matter how much they charge or how much a parent is willing to donate "If they tip you off that they have connections with admissions officers, that's a red flag," he said.
Ivy Coach students sign and submit their own applications, according to Taylor. He said the fact that Singer was submitting applications on behalf of his clients was "a mark of unscrupulousness in and of itself."
In some cases, according to federal prosecutors, Singer and parents conspired to reduce the role of school guidance counselors in the process, since those counselors knew the students' true academic and athletic records.
Accusations of untoward behavior, short of lawbreaking, are not uncommon in the world of high-priced admissions consulting. The large size of Ivy Coach's fees caused it to be kicked out of one incustry association.
Redding of Harvard said she worried that the attention on the case this week would cast a negative light on the entire college consuiting industry, which, she added, had taken strides in recent years to police itself.
"There are lots of good ac:ors here who get overshadowed in a case like this,''' she said.

Texto completo: AUSTIN, Texas - Surprises abounded at this year's South by Southwest film festival, with movies featuring depraved demons, devilish doppelgangers and sadistic senseis all doing despicable things. And yet, one of the most gasp-worthy moments was hearing tween actor Jacob Tremblay use the F-word in the first five minutes of "Good Boys." It wouldn't be the only time in this comedy about a wild day in the life of a few sixth-graders, and it was one of several breakout titles worth knowing about as the film portion of the festival comes to a close Saturday.
"If I'm being honest, I am shocked and appalled," Tremblay joked during the post-screening Q&A, and added referring to his director Gene Stupnitsky, "Gene told me this was going to be a PG-rated family movie. He lied."
The movie was right at home at a festival that has turned into something of a testing ground for the hit potential of Hollywood comedies. The audience applauded the comic timing of Tremblay and his co-stars, Brady Noon and scene-stealing Keith L. Williams, and that positive reaction along with a recently released red-band trailer featuring one of the movie's producers, Seth Rogen, has fueled social-media interest. "Good Boys" opens nationwide in August.
Another talker was Olivia Wilde's directing debut, "Booksmart." Much like "Good Boys," it follows students on a wild day, but this one is female-focused. Beanie Feldstein and Kaitlyn Dever star as high school seniors who, on the last day of school, realize they may have studied too hard and partied too softly. They make up for that in one outrageous evening that includes drugged strawberries and a raucous graduation bash. The packed house at the Paramount theater especially appreciated the killer soundtrack and a high laugh-per-minute ratio.
Also winning over festivalgoers was "Long Shot," a rom-com starring Rogen and Charlize Theron. The crowd was drawn to the combination of smart and slapstick humor, and was also roused by a Boyz II Men cameo. Then, after the screening, could it really happen? Or do dreams just fade away? The pop group did a little East Coast swing in a surprise performance.
The laughs had a mellower edge at the premiere of the Harmony Korine comedy "The Beach Bum," starring Matthew McConaughey as Moondog, the pothead writer he may have been born to play. The crowd basked in the movie's hazy glow, and McConaughey was a great sport, attending the after-party dressed in character. Critical reaction to the film was a little more mixed. Variety wrote, "The question here isn't if McConaughey is having fun, but whether audiences will find his laid-back, ever-lit persona nearly as entertaining to watch." And The Hollywood Reporter said that the film was "high on style, if not substance."
Humor was also a thread through some of the festival's darker films, including Jordan Peele's "Us," which opened SXSW and featured a measured number of laugh- and shriek-worthy sequences. Similarly, audiences winced and laughed during "The Art of Self-Defense," starring Jesse Eisenberg in a deadpan role as an accountant who is brutally attacked by masked assailants. Taking classes at a dojo, he meets a sensei (Alessandro Nivola) with a tainted worldview. The comedy is pitch-black, but the crowd appreciated its sinister quirks.
Other funny journeys down twisted roads included "Porno," a 1992-set film about conservative Christian teenagers working in a small-town movie theater. After discovering an old film hidden in the walls, they inadvertently unleash a sex demon that wreaks havoc. Keola Racela's debut feature, with more than one instance of genital mutilation played for laughs, made festivalgoers squirm but got them talking as well.
"Villains," directed by Dan Berk and Robert Olsen, put a fun twist on the home-invasion genre, with Bill Skarsgard and Maika Monroe as criminals on the lam. When their car runs out of gas, they pick the wrong home to break into, that of a couple (Jeffrey Donovan and Kyra Sedgwick) with a few skeletons in their closet and another secret in their basement.
And in keeping with the Boys/Boyz festival motif, there was "Boyz in the Wood," a hallucinogenic comedy-survival tale from music video director Ninian Doff about teenagers in the Scottish Highlands who become more hunted than hunters. The site Film School Rejects described it as "'Hot Fuzz' meets Attack the Block.'" The movie was the subject of so much chatter that SXSW added an extra screening.
The festival wasn't entirely lighthearted. Its two major jury awards went to much more serious-minded films. "Alice," Josephine Mackerras' drama about a woman (Emilie Piponnier) who becomes a prostitute to support her child, won the narrative feature prize. And "For Sama," which focuses on a young female Syrian filmmaker, Waad al-Kateab, who cataloged harrowing aspects of her life in Aleppo for five years, took the documentary feature award.
But the festival's biggest and funniest standouts show its programming strengths, and reinforce the value of the theatrical experience, the opportunity to laugh, and sometimes cringe, with a large, responsive audience.

Los secretos del juicio a “El Chapo” que fiscales deberán revelar por orden del juez

Texto completo: Durante la preparación del juicio a Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán Loera , los fiscales federales sellaron varios temas relacionados con sus testigos, principalmente cooperantes, que pudieran afectar su credibilidad al ser cuestionados por los abogados del líder del Cártel de Sinaloa.
Los abogados del New York Times y de VICE News presentaron mociones para exigir que se diera a conocer esa información que se ocultó en la mayor parte del proceso que ocurrió entre el 5 de noviembre de 2018 y el 31 de enero de 2019.
Uno de los primeros documentos revelados fue parte del testimonio previo de Alex Cifuentes , exsocio de Guzmán Loera, quien reveló que el mexicano pagó por menores de hasta 13 años para drogarlas y tener sexo con ellas en sus escondites en las montañas de Sinaloa.
Sin embargo, hay más secretos por revelar, debido a la presión jurídica de los medios mencionados. En enero, el juez Brian Cogan determinó que se diera a conocer esa información y los fiscales elaboran una lista de qué darán a conocer paulatinamente.
“Los fiscales federales revelaron parte de los documentos del juicio de ‘El Chapo'” , informó Keegan Hamilton, reportero de VICE News. “El material incluye información adicional de Alex Cifuentes y las actividades sexuales de ‘El Chapo’ con menores de edad”.
#BREAKING @vicenews: Prosecutors just unsealed a new batch of court documents from El Chapo's trial.
The material includes additional info on witness Alex Cifuentes and Chapo's "sexual activities with underage partners"https://t.co/Gk8QSKAZwU pic.twitter.com/QVRpDFNQiL
— Keegan Hamilton (@keegan_hamilton) March 15, 2019
“Un hilo sobre la secrecía en el capo del Chapo: En enero el juez Cogan, respondiendo a abogado del NYT, ordenó a la defensa y a fiscales revelar algunos de los muchos, muchos documentos en el caso”, señaló el periodista Alan Feuer , del Times.
A thread about the ongoing secrecy in the Chapo case:

— Alan Feuer (@alanfeuer) March 16, 2019
Los documentos compartidos por Hamilton establecen una lista de temáticas sobre las cuales los fiscales no querían que se hablara en la corte, ya que pudo afectar la credibilidad de sus cooperantes. Los representantes del Gobierno de Estados Unidos indicaron que los hechos no estuvieran directamente relacionados con las acusaciones contra Guzmán Loera, por lo que eran irrelevantes para el juicio.
Por ejemplo, se menciona al cooperante CW1 –identificado como Cifuentes– y la violencia doméstica contra su esposa, incluso agresiones durante su embarazo, así como sus interés sexual en menores indistintamente del sexo.
En el punto se menciona la complicidad sobre asuntos sexuales que Cifuentes mantenía con “El Chapo”, pero no se brindan mayores detalles.
“Actividades sexuales de CW1 y demandadas con socios menores de edad (miembros del Cártel de Sinaloa)”, indica el documento. “El acusado también busca interrogar a CW1 acerca de detalles altamente escabrosos concerniente a la actividad sexual que él y el acusado tuvieron con parejas menores para dos razones: (1) presenta una inconsistencia con la forma en que CW1 vio el tratamiento de otros menores, a saber, hombres jóvenes entre las edades de 16 y 17 años ; y (2) lleva en la relación de CW1 con el acusado, aunque el acusado busca limitar el testimonio acerca de su propia persona “, indica el documento en referencia a que los abogados de Guzmán Loera quería desacreditar a Cifuentes sin afectar a su cliente.
También se habla de sacar a la luz aquellos temas relacionados con esoterismo y el culto a sectas como los Illuminati, la vida extraterrestre, así como homicidios desconocidos y otros casos que pudieran afectar a cooperantes y al propio Guzmán Loera, lejos de los 10 cargos en su contra por los que fue hallado culpable.
La sentencia de “El Chapo” está programada para el 25 de junio, pero en las siguientes semanas se espera que los abogados presenten una solicitud de nuevo juicio, luego de que un jurado revelara que no se siguieron las reglas ordenadas por el juez Cogan.

La noticia de su fallecimiento la anunció este lunes la Universidad de Princeton (Nueva Jersey) donde el economista impartía clases.

En la mañana del sábado, la policía de Princeton encontró el cuerpo sin vida del profesor en su propia casa . Poco después del anuncio del fallecimiento, tanto Bill Clinton como Barack Obama expresaron públicamente su admiración hacia Krueger como economista y servidor público y mostraron sus condolencias hacia su familia.
“Alan Krueger fue un economista brillante para el interés público ” -dijo en Twitter el expresidente Clinton. Y resaltó la investigación de Krueger que desembocó en la subida del salario mínimo . Entre 1994 y 1995, durante la administración Clinton, Krueger fue el economista jefe del Departamento de Trabajo.
Según indicó el rotativo The New York Times, donde Krueger colaboraba habitualmente, el economista investigó la relación entre el salario mínimo y el desempleo . Su conclusión fue que que establecer una cantidad no reducía el empleo de aquellos trabajadores con menor renta. Recientemente, como también resalto Clinton es su tweet, estudió el papel de la epidemia de los opiáceos -emergencia nacional desde 2017- en la reducción del empleo entre los hombres .
Alan Krueger was a brilliant economist for the public interest—from his research proving that raising the minimum wage doesn't increase unemployment, to his recent work showing that America's opioid epidemic has increased it. My thoughts are with his family. We lost him too soon.
— Bill Clinton (@BillClinton) March 18, 2019
Por su parte, Barack Obama dijo en declaraciones que “ Estados Unidos había perdido un economista brillante y muchos de nosotros a un amigo querido “. El expresidente también resaltó que la política económica de Krueger estaba enfocada en “mejorar la vida de la gente”.
Krueger fue asesor de Obama durante la crisis financiera de 2008 y también durante su posterior recuperación . También fue subsecretario del Tesoro y más tarde presidente de Consejo de Asesores Económicos de la Presidencia estadounidense.
Según el Centros para el Control y la Prevención de Enfermedades de EEUU (CDC, por sus siglas en inglés); las muertes por suicidios, drogas, medicamentos y alcohol alcanzaron un máximo histórico en 2017: más de 150,000 personas, una cifra que dobla la de 1999 .

Texto completo: NEW YORK (AP) -- An 8-year-old boy's victory as New York state chess champion will be his family's ticket out of a homeless shelter.

The New York Times reported that Tani Adewumi won the state chess title for his age group this month even though he learned to play only about a year ago.

Tani and his family have lived in a New York City shelter since fleeing Nigeria in 2017. The family feared attacks by the militant group Boko Haram on Christians like themselves.

Tani's chess coach Russell Makofsky set up a GoFundMe account for the family after Tani won the championship.

Makofsky joined Tani on NBC's "Today" show Tuesday and said that thanks to donations, the family is moving into an apartment.

Tani says he "felt surprised" by his win.

The massacre in New Zealand

Texto completo: Last week in New Zealand, a self-avowed white supremacist targeted two mosques and streamed his bloody killing spree on social media.
There are at least three condemnations that should result from the massacre.
The first condemnation is for the act itself. The callous slaughter of people at prayer is part of an age that has devalued life, from unrestricted abortions, to street shootings and other terrorist attacks. That some of these assaults are motivated by twisted views of religion, or in this case, a white supremacist opposed to immigration, is all part of the same piece. Murder and hate should not be categorized.
The second condemnation goes to politicians and special interest groups who blame President Trump and the NRA, seeking to make political hay out of an action that had nothing to do with either. That the shooter mentioned the president as "a symbol of white supremacy" does not make him one. Critics will use anything in an attempt to discredit and weaken Trump's appeal before next year's election. Shame on them.
The gunman, whose name shall not be mentioned here, posted a 74-page "manifesto" and details of his evil intent 24 hours before the slaughter. While more will be learned as the investigation continues, a third condemnation may eventually fall on those politicians and media people who were sent the manifesto. Did they not take it seriously, or was there too little time to respond?
Did no one see it? If someone did, why didn't they call police? If they did call, why did the police not pay him a visit? Social media is often quick to take down "inappropriate" postings. How did the gunman manage to escape censors for a heinous act far worse than offensive speech? Press reports say the shooter had also planned a terror attack on Muslims last December. Did no one hear about that? If they did, why weren't police contacted? Again, if they were, why didn't they visit the man's home?
New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern promised to strengthen her country's gun laws. Would stronger laws have deterred a man intent on mass murder? The police mainly determine who is qualified to own a gun. The New York Times reported: "While New Zealand's laws governing the purchase of semiautomatic rifles are more restrictive than those in the United States, the country is much freer with firearms than Australia is, allowing most guns to be purchased without requiring them to be tracked." The prime minister can start there.
Investigators will find how the shooter, who is a gun club member, obtained his weapons and whether he was licensed to possess them.
Meanwhile, houses of worship are finding it necessary to employ armed guards, which is a judgment on our increasingly anti-life culture. More guards will likely be hired in the aftermath of the mosque shootings.
New Zealand is the popular location for film companies. Perhaps the most famous film series produced there is "Lord of the Rings," based on the books by J.R.R. Tolkien. In "The Fellowship of the Ring," there is this quote: "Many that live deserve death. And some that die deserve life. Can you give it to them? Then do not be too eager to deal out death in judgement."
The shooter dealt death in his judgment. New Zealand no longer imposes capital punishment. If ever there was a person who deserves the death penalty it is this shooter, and not just because it might deter others. More importantly, capital punishment imposed on this monster would exact justice for those innocent people who were killed or wounded and for their families.

Texto completo: On the surface, the Costco Anywhere Visa Card by Citi seems like the most logical card to swipe at Costco, and the Disney Premier Visa Card might seem like the optimal card to fund your Disney vacation. But you should always read your credit card terms and conditions to find out if that's really the case. Here are some tips for getting the most out of co-branded credit cards. SALLY FRENCH
DON'T FALL FOR MARKETING TACTICS that make rewards seem more valuable than they really are. "People see the Disney logo and think, 'That's going to be the best way to help me earn money for my Disney vacation,"' said Holly Porter Johnson, co-author of the book Zero Down Your Debt: Reclaim Your Income and Build a Life You'll Love. "People don't read the fine print." If you do your homework, you may find alternative ways to get the same (or better) rewards. Some Disney aficionados might justify the Disney Premier Visa Card's $49 annual fee because it gives them 10 percent off at the Disney Store, but they might not realize that the $0-annual-fee Disney Visa Debit Card offers the same benefit.
BE AWARE OF HOW VALUABLE your rewards really are. John Grund, managing director of payments at Accenture, said many of the rewards he sees advertised have "strong headline value" but aren't actually as meaningful as they first appear.
A reward of 4 percent on gas seems bountiful. But break it down. The average American household spends less than $2,000 a year on gas or other fuels. That spending results in about $80 of rewards a year. That's not nothing; it covers a couple of tanks of gas. But it's hardly a gold mine.
DON'T BE SEDUCED by the perks. Many co-branded cards offer perks that play into people's fantasies. A free Disneyland ticket after a year of spending has more cachet than a few dollars direct-deposited into your account every month. But is it really better? Often the answer is no. You may well be better off earning cash back in a straightforward way rather than sticking with a card that limits your rewards spending or perks to a specific merchant.
BUT DON'T WRITE THEM OFF completely. Some co-branded cards actually offer the highest rate we found for shopping at that store, such as the Target REDcard, which offers 5 percent off on most Target purchases.

Female economists face bias, harassment

Texto completo: 'Very distressing' survey responses prompt calls for sweeping changes
An alarmingly high number of female and minority economists say that they have faced discrimination and harassment and that they do not feel welcome in the profession, according to a survey released Monday by the American Economic Association that is prompting calls for sweeping changes.
Economics has been going through a #MeToo moment in recent months, and the survey results from more than 9,200 economists are the latest indication that the problems are deep and widespread.
"We find the results very distressing," said Ben Bernanke, president of the AEA and former chair of the Federal Reserve and President George W. Bush's Council of Economic Advisers. He said his top priority is to restore "simple decency" to economics.
Women have far worse experiences than men in the economics profession, according to the survey. Thirty percent of female economists said they felt discriminated against, compared with 12 percent of men. Women felt they were treated especially unfairly when it came to pay, promotion decisions, course evaluations and expectations of serving on various committees.
One question asked whether the respondent had faced a situation in which another economist had attempted to fondle, kiss, remove clothing or have oral sex without their consent. Nearly 175 women said this had happened to them.
"The sheer number of people who have experienced an episode of harassment or discrimination is unacceptably high," said Janet L. Yellen, president-elect of the AEA and a former Fed chair and head of President Bill Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers. "This confirms in my mind that there is a significant problem that requires being addressed forcefully."
The AEA released a letter alongside the survey results Monday that pledged to take numerous actions, including the creation of a code of conduct, the adoption of a policy on harassment and discrimination, and the appointment of a lawyer who is an expert in sexual harassment and discrimination to serve as an ombudsman whom any economist can call.
"One thing is clear: There is systematic evidence of differences of views between men and women in terms of how valued they feel in the field of economics and whether they're given a fair chance to demonstrate their skills and get promoted," Bernanke said in an interview with The Washington Post.
Overall, only 20 percent of women said they were "satisfied" with the culture in the field of economics, compared with 40 percent of men - a higher percentage, but still troubling to Bernanke.
Economics has struggled for years to get more women and minorities into the field. Less than a third of undergraduate economics majors and enrollees in PhD programs are women, figures that haven't moved since 2000 even as women have made educational gains in other technical professions, such as computer science.
The survey, which includes numerous questions about people's experiences in their careers, was sent to everyone who has been an AEA member in the past nine years, an effort to try to include the views of people who have been so frustrated with economics that they have left the field. The vast majority of respondents teach at colleges and universities, but some work at companies or for government agencies such as the Federal Reserve.
Some might point out that the response rate was only about 20 percent, but members of the AEA board counter that the rate is better than political polls and note that their results echo numerous other studies. The data also line up with personal anecdotes from female economists, who have come forward to talk about their experiences of being ostracized in nearly all-male departments or being outright groped.
"I don't want to see numbers this high," said Marianne Bertrand, an economics professor at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business and chair of AEA's Committee on Equity, Diversity and Professional Conduct. "I'm very hopeful that economists are going to look at these numbers and reflect on what they can do."
The AEA vows more vetting of economists who serve on the AEA board or receive prestigious awards, and there are changes in the works to the AEA bylaws to make it easier to remove someone from the board who violates the code of conduct. Harvard University economics professor Roland Fryer Jr. was elected to the AEA's executive committee last year, and around the same time, harassment allegations about him surfaced in the New York Times. He denied the allegations but resigned before taking up the position.
The AEA also is working on expanded mentoring programs and anti-bias training for economics department chairs. Many women say problems occur at their universities, which have their own sets of rules and norms.
"One of my moves professionally was primarily motivated by a bullying culture in one department," Susan Athey, an economics professor at Stanford's Graduate School of Business, said at the AEA meeting in early January.
Yellen, who is often cited as one of the most powerful women in the world, also disclosed in January how she felt discriminated against as a young female professor at Harvard in the early 1970s. None of her male peers would co-write a paper with her, she said.
Nearly 70 percent of female economists feel their work isn't take as seriously as their colleagues, compared with 43 percent of men who feel that way, according to the survey.
Yellen will become AEA president in 2020 and has pledged to continue her push to get gender parity in the economics profession during her lifetime by advocating for a cultural shift.
"Every individual needs to feel it's their responsibility to try to change things. There are too many people who sit around and see things and don't do anything," Yellen said.

Texto completo: Let me try to get this straight. If I remember right, President Bill Clinton was impeached in 1998 for lying to the American people about Monica Lewinsky. Bad Bill. Now, if I understand this correctly, the present occupant of the White House has lied to the American people at last count, over 9,000 times. Bad, bad and bad. I watched the draft-dodger-in-chief hugging the American flag. Isn't this the same guy who is good buddies with Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong Un? Oh, I must have the wrong guy. But 88 percent of Republicans are behind him. Oh, what the heck. Maybe I worry too much about my country.

Teaching text
I recently heard an eye-opening interview on a local radio station. The interviewee was Dr. Bruce C. Bunker, a scientist who has worked, among other places, at Sandia National Laboratories. The subject was global warming and his new book, The Mythology of Global Warming: Climate Change Fiction vs. Scientific Facts. It was such an interesting interview that I purchased his book from Amazon and just finished reading it.
This book is so well-written and documented that it should be read by anyone interested in the subject. It should be required reading for anyone running for political office or in position to teach our children.

Old and new guard
As the old and new Democratic Party heats up and argues about the U.S. relationship with Israel ("House's Anti-Semitism Resolution Exposes Generational Fight Over Ilhan Omar," the New York Times, March 5), it becomes clear what psychological process is at play. A healthy entity -- whether human or institutional -- has the capacity for self-reflection and critique when necessary. The old-guard Democrats appear to be stuck in the post-World
War II relationship with Israel. This is a new millennium, where it is necessary to look at relationships with an honest view, including the actual behaviors of Israel. Ilhan Omar is being singled out by the old guard in her honesty about American self-reflection. It is a generational difference. The old guard will be fading soon, I hope. On the other hand, the Republican Party doesn't even have a clue what this discourse is about.

Common sense
A Green New Deal will keep Americans safe from climate change and create millions of green jobs. It is common-sense policy that is overwhelmingly popular with American people, regardless of political party or where they live. Any presidential candidate who wants to be taken seriously on climate and earn the support of young people needs to support the resolution from Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass.

Public versus private
In response to Alvis E. McDonald's Letter to the Editor ("Textbooks for all," March 6), my brother went to a small, local private school and I went to public school. The private school he went to provided the books. I am 70 years old, and I remember that we never did pay for private school textbooks.
After I had grown and left my parents house, my mom told me that even though she had no children in school she was proud to pay her property taxes (from which school supplies were purchased) because she believed that there was no greater mandate than public education.
We should not pay for private school books when our public schools are so underfunded. If parents feel the need to privately educate their children, they should be responsible for all aspects of their education; otherwise there are public schools in this country.

Fascinated with reptiles
I am a fifth-grade student attending Flowery Elementary School in Sonoma, Calif. My teacher assigned my class to select a state in the U.S., and do a special report on the selected state, and I chose New Mexico. I am very fascinated with reptiles, and New Mexico is the home of many interesting reptiles, insects and arachnids, which is one of the reasons I chose it. I do not know much about New Mexico, and I would love to learn more.
I am hoping you can help me collect information about New Mexico by sending me pamphlets, brochures, pictures, postcards, etc., regarding New Mexico's history and tourist destinations so that I can complete my New Mexico report.
You may send these items to: Ms. Chavarria, Flowery Elementary School, 17600 Sonoma Hwy., Sonoma, CA, 95476.
Thank you for taking your valuable time to read this and help me with my report.

Texto completo: Tras la detención de Anthony Comello como presunto responsable del homicidio del capo Francesco “Frank” Cali se indicó que el caso podría no estar relacionado con la historia criminal de la víctima.
El New York Times revela que varios oficiales indican que las indagatorias se perfilan hacia un “amor prohibido”.
Los agentes indicaron que Comello tenía interés romántico por una de las familiares del Cali , pero el jefe de la mafia le dijo al joven de 24 años de edad que se mantuviera alejado de ella. Se desconoce la identidad de la mujer.
El rechazo fue lo que, indican, desató la furia del muchacho, pero oficialmente, el jefe de detectives del Departamento de Policía, Dermot Shea , dijo que su gente estaba examinando “múltiples ángulos” del posible motivo del homicidio.
Comello fue arrestado en una casa propiedad de su familia en Brick, Nueva Jersey el sábado y está recluido en la cárcel del Condado de Ocean.
Los detectives tienen una grabación del asesinato de una cámara de seguridad afuera de la casa del Cali, y las huellas dactilares de Comello coinciden con las que se sacaron de una placa que el pistolero recogió y entregó a Cali antes de abrir fuego, según la Policía.
El hombre de 24 años de edad era graduado de Tottenville High School, vivía con sus padres en la sección de Eltingville en Staten Island, dijeron los vecinos.
“Él limpiaba la nieve por nosotros”, dijo Victor Ujeck , un vecino. “He visto a sus padres varias veces, también gente muy agradable… Nunca me hubiera imaginado que pudiera hacer esto”.
Didar Janid , de 46 años, trabaja en la bodega Campos, a pocas cuadras de la casa del sospechoso en Staten Island, dijo que había conocido al Comello desde hace casi ocho años y lo describió como alguien con personalidad “fuerte”.

Texto completo: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said at her weekly news conference on Thursday that she favors lowering the voting age to 16.
Teens should have a voice on federal elections
By David de la Fuente
In the 1960s, the country asked itself that if young men can die in Vietnam, then shouldn’t they be trusted with the right to vote? Similarly now, we must ask ourselves that if 16- and 17-year-olds can contribute to society through work, and face the criminal justice system as adults, isn't it only reasonable to allow them the right of self-determination through voting?
In these teen years, many individuals begin to work and pay taxes. This is also when we grant the right to drive a car. On the flip side, about 250,000 youth are tried, sentenced or incarcerated as adults every year across the USA. When they're contributing to society or being held liable by society in these ways, they should also be able to weigh in on the future of our country and those responsible for the laws that affect them.

That's why it was great to see freshman Rep. Joe Neguse, D-Colo. , lead an effort that allows 16- and 17-year-olds to preregister to vote ahead of their 18th birthday. This policy has already worked in many states: 14 states (and Washington, D. C. ) already allow teenagers to preregister to vote at 16, and nine allow it for 17-year-olds.
In California alone, since 2016, more than 200,000 teenagers preregistered before their 18th birthdays.
Congress only has the authority to lower the voting age for federal elections. That's what sparked the 26th Amendment, which in 1971 lowered the voting age in every election to 18.
Freshmen Rep. Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass. , proposed lowering the voting age from 18 to 16 for federal elections. The proposal failed with only 126 votes but represented a turning point in the fight for enfranchisement. It had the support of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who has championed such efforts at the local level in California for years.
Because voter turnout is habitual, it seems like a no-brainer to let people start voting at a younger age. If 16- and 17-year-olds can go to the polls with their parents or other adult figures, it could begin a lifetime of such civic engagement.
Lowering the voting age is a worthy endeavor. Let's do it.

What others are saying
Jeff Jacoby, The Boston Globe: "Teens more often rely on the amygdala, the more emotional, primitive part of the brain. It isn’t from gratuitous animus that car-rental agencies make it difficult for young drivers to rent a vehicle. Or that the Constitution establishes 25 as the minimum age to be a member of Congress. Of course, another reason that 16-year-olds are subject to so many restrictions that don’t apply to grown-ups is that they don’t know anything — or in any case, they don’t know enough to be trusted to make sound decisions about liquor, firearms, joining the Marines and governing the United States. The ignorance of teens is practically a cliché. "
Laurence Steinberg, The New York Times: "Cold cognitive abilities are those we use when we are in a calm situation, when we are by ourselves and have time to deliberate and when the most important skill is the ability to reason logically with facts. Voting is a good example of this sort of situation. Studies of cold cognition have shown that the skills necessary to make informed decisions are firmly in place by 16. By that age, adolescents can gather and process information, weigh pros and cons, reason logically with facts and take time before making a decision. Teenagers may sometimes make bad choices, but statistically speaking, they do not make them any more often than adults do. "
Noah Berlatsky, CNN. com: "In (America) people start voting at 18. That's the year that they often move off to college. They either have to cast ballots in a community with which they're unfamiliar, or pay attention to elections in a place where they no longer reside. That's a recipe for indifference. It would be much easier to encourage people to vote for the first time, and to establish voting patterns for a lifetime, when they're 16 and in high school. . . . One objection is that young people will just vote like their parents. But researchers have found that people are always influenced by those close to them. People of all ages vote like their parents, or like their spouses, or like their neighbors. "
What readers are saying
Since 2016, (some) Democrats have endorsed ending the Electoral College, lowering the voting age to 16 and giving undocumented immigrants the ability to vote. Why? Because they know they can't beat President Donald Trump in 2020 under the current rules.
— @TimRunsHisMouth
Disagree that Democrats are (trying to lower the voting age) to address the 2020 election alone. It's a reaction to GOP gerrymandering. I am for two things: 1. Automatic registration and 2. Voting on Election Day.
— @gmadison1787
Most 16-year-olds don’t even have a solid view of what they want to do with their future. Why would you lower the voting age for them to choose someone to run the entire country, when they don't even know what to have for breakfast?
— @joceyk13
This is what concerns me about lowering the voting age to 16. In our culture, as teenagers we do not have the needed life skills to make informed decisions that not only affect ourselves but millions of others.

Texto completo: An 8-year-old living in a homeless shelter has won the New York State chess championship for his age bracket.
“I want to be the youngest grandmaster,” Tanitoluwa Adewumi, a Nigerian refugee who goes by Tani, told The New York Times.
Tanitoluwa placed first in the New York State Scholastic Championships tournament for kindergarten through third grade — a remarkable win for anyone.
“It’s unheard of for any kid, let alone one in a homeless shelter,” Russell Makofsky, who oversees Manhattan's P. S. 116 chess program, told USA TODAY.
Tanitoluwa hasn't had an easy life. His family left northern Nigeria in 2017 fearing attacks on Christians, The New York Times reports, and moved to New York City over a year ago where the boy learned how to play chess at school. He and his family live in a homeless shelter.
School chess coach Shawn Martinez saw Tanitoluwa's potential after observing him excel in the game a few weeks after first learning it early last year.
He reached out to Tanitoluwa's family about joining the school's chess program, and learned they were unable to pay costs associated with membership. Makofsky decided to wave Tanitoluwa's fees, which can easily exceed thousands with travel and chess camp admissions.

More: Middle school chess coach facing allegations of throwing matches, could get lifetime ban
A student gifted Tanitoluwa a chess clock. Tanitoluwa's mother took him to free regular three-hour practice sessions in Harlem. His dad lets him use a laptop to play chess online.
Seven trophies later, the elementary school boy is one of the top players in the country for his age group.
"He works very hard at his game," Martinez said, estimating Tanitoluwa could achieve master status "in the next year or two. " The world's youngest grandmaster qualified at the age of 12.
As Tanitoluwa's story hits national headlines, more people want to help.
Makofsky, who set up a GoFundMe for Tanitoluwa, said the family has received offers for a car, legal services, jobs and even housing.
"My hope is that he'll be in a home tonight," Makofsky said.

Texto completo: Facebook said it quickly removed videos of a gunman opening fire inside a New Zealand mosque on Friday who appeared to have live-streamed his attack in a 17-minute video that looked to be recorded on a helmet camera.
The Facebook video began with the man driving up to Masjid Al Noor mosque in the city of Christchurch. After parking his car, the man armed himself with at least one weapon and walked into the place of worship, immediately shooting a person in the doorway.
In a statement posted to Twitter, Facebook said police alerted them to the video shortly after the livestream commenced and removed both the video and the gunman's Facebook and Instagram accounts.
"We're also removing any praise or support for the crime and the shooter or shooters as soon as we’re aware," Facebook said. The social network said they will continue working with police in New Zealand as their investigation is underway.
Google-owned YouTube said in a statement on Twitter that it is "working vigilantly" to remove any violent footage. "Our hearts are broken over today’s terrible tragedy in New Zealand," said YouTube in its statement.
In statements to the Washington Post, Twitter and Reddit said they were working to remove any videos from their platforms.
In a more than 70-page manifesto posted to various sites, including Twitter and Scribd, that appeared to belong to the gunman, he identified himself as a 28-year-old white male born in Australia and listed white nationalist heroes.
In Sydney, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced Friday that an Australian citizen had been arrested in the mosque shootings.

The names of mass killers were written in white on his weapons, multiple media outlets reported.
The New Zealand Herald, which watched the live-stream video, reported that the gunman "began shooting indiscriminately" upon entering the mosque.
He shot a second victim who was crawling in the main hallway, then blocked the hallway and began shooting at people who were cowering in corners of a room. He stopped to reload several times, the Herald reported, and then resumed firing repeatedly.
After three minutes inside, the gunman exited through the mosque's front door. Video showed him shooting randomly at cars. He got more ammunition out of his car trunk, the Herald reported, then shot at no apparent target on the street.
"Looks like we won't get the bird today, boys," he said in the video.
At another point, he said, “There wasn’t even time to aim, there was so many targets,” the New York Times reported.
He then re-entered the mosque, firing at people lying motionless on the ground. The video ended with him driving away from the scene, the Herald reported.

Capitol’s insider pipeline

Texto completo: TALLAHASSEE  As Gov. Ron DeSantis transition team considered candidates to run Floridas state prisons late last year, U.S. Rep. Matt Gaetz picked up the phone  and dialed Jared Kushner.

President Donald Trumps son-in-law and key adviser passed along a glowing endorsement of Mark Inch, the former head of the federal Bureau of Prisons and a retired two-star Army general.

Thats exactly who DeSantis ended up naming as Floridas secretary of corrections.

The appointment shows how DeSantis draws from a different ecosystem of insiders than the usual suspects in Tallahassee, which he derided as the swamp during his gubernatorial campaign. He has instead turned to the world of Trump.

In the first meeting we had with our transition co-chairs, the governor was very clear: he did not us want us fishing inside an aquarium for talent, Gaetz said.

DeSantis has brought at least five former Trump officials into his fold. Some, like Inch, hold high-profile posi

tions aligned with their expertise.

But in politics, loyalty is also a currency, and other hires are former campaign workers now earning six figures in the DeSantis administration despite questions about their professional credentials.

DeSantis calls the appointments another example of how his ties with Trump benefit Florida.

That speaks well of me being able to get folks like that, he told reporters at a January news conference, referring to Inch and Agency for Health Care Administration Secretary Mary Mayhew, Trumps one-time Medicaid chief.

The hires contrast starkly with DeSantis Republican predecessor. Then-Gov. Rick Scott left dozens of jobs open for months after his 2010 election, with dreams of filling them from the ranks of corporate America. When that failed, he ultimately settled for a mix of Tallahassee insiders and young loyalists from his campaign.

Susan MacManus, a University of South Florida political scientist, has observed administrations dating back to Gov. Bob Martinez in the late 1980s. She said that while its unusual for Florida governors to draw from such a national network, DeSantis hires follow a familiar pattern.

All governors, especially new ones, tend to go with people who are loyal to them and people who have helped them get there, MacManus said. Obviously, Trump helped him get there.

DeSantis speaks with Trump regularly and leans on a conservative network from across the country when seeking advice. Some of those in that network include Trumps acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, and former Nevada Attorney General Adam Laxalt, who also ran for governor with Trumps endorsement last year but was defeated.

The most prominent Trump émigrés are Inch, Mayhew and Helen Aguirre Ferré, who heads DeSantis communications team after doing a similar job for the White House.

When asked whether his time working for Trump has influenced the way he would approach his state job, Inch answered simply: No.

He emphasized that he was not appointed by Trump to lead the federal Bureau of Prisons (rather, it was then-U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions).

I would think my hiring here was just based on my personal experiences, primarily military. I mean, 35 years is military which by definition is apolitical, Inch, 58, told the Times/Herald. His salary is $142,546.

DeSantis, a Navy veteran, values military service and has chosen several agency heads who are veterans.

According to reports by the New York Times, Inch left the Trump administration after only months on the job. He reportedly was caught in the crossfire between Sessions and Kushner, who clashed over criminal justice reforms.

Mayhew, 53, also served a short time  around three months  for Trump. She was known to Gaetz and DeSantis for her work in Maine before she arrived in Washington. Gaetz said Maine was consistently held up as the gold standard for creative cost reduction by conservatives during healthcare debate on the floor of the U.S. House, when DeSantis and Gaetz were both there.

Mayhew, who is paid $161,000, was arguably the transitions most controversial hire. During her seven years as Maines health commissioner she tightened eligibility requirements for Medicaid and added restrictions to food stamps, leading to a decline in Medicaid enrollment and less money spent on safety-net programs.

Gaetz said Mayhew emerged during the transition as the best candidate to carry out the health care vision of Florida House Speaker José Oliva after DeSantis suggested we look for high-end talent that helped Maine.

Ferré, a native of Miami, is paid $164,000. She worked in Florida for many years first as a journalist, including as an op-ed columnist for the Miami Herald, and as a senior adviser to former Gov. Jeb Bushs presidential campaign. She was named White House director of media affairs in January 2017.

Ferré, 61, left in August 2018 for a similar job with the National Endowment for the Arts.

Her exit came amid an investigation into Ferré and other White House officials for using their official positions to promote Trumps presidential campaign, which is illegal. An independent federal investigator determined Ferré violated federal law by including Trumps Make America Great Again slogan in the banner of her official Twitter account.

Ferré said the banner was added before Trump officially relaunched his re-election campaign. Once informed of this, the banner was changed, she said.

While that should not necessarily prevent her from finding a job in Florida government, it is worth noting that she does have an ethical strike against her, said Jordan Libowitz, spokesman for Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Government, the nonpartisan organization that made the complaint against Ferré.

Not all the former Trump appointments were strangers to DeSantis.

Tim Page went directly from Trumps campaign to Washington with little background in the agency where he landed: the U.S. Department of Agriculture. His salary during that stint was $66,510. A 2016 college graduate, his only other professional experience was at a landscaping company he started in college, according to his online resume.

Page was in that job for 11 months until he left for the Consumer Energy Alliance, a group backed by large energy companies that advocates for offshore drilling and opposes regulation on carbon pollution.

But Page was pulled back into politics by DeSantis campaign.

When the election ended, DeSantis named Page, 26, deputy secretary of the department of business regulation. Hes making nearly twice as much as he did in Trumps administration  $110,000 a year.

Ferré said in a statement that Page earned well at his job for the energy group and took a pay cut to work for DeSantis.

Tim understands the importance of Gov. DeSantis focus on deregulation as it negatively impacts small businesses and job growth, she said.

Another late edition to DeSantis campaign was Justin Caporale, who previously worked for first lady Melania Trump.

According to multiple reports, Caporale had issues with his security clearance and was let go by former chief of staff John Kelly. This led to a rift between Kelly and the first lady that reportedly contributed to Kellys ouster.

Now, DeSantis office is paying Caporale $120,000 as director of external affairs in charge of program and events.

In a statement, Aguirre Ferré said Caporale, 30, is a well-known professional in the world of GOP politics and campaigns, and was the executive director of DeSantis inauguration.

Caporale left to pursue other opportunities which is not unusual given the grueling schedule, Ferré wrote of his White House departure. We do not have any information from the White House, where he worked for one and a half years, that indicates Justin Caporale had an issue with his security clearance.

The White House wouldnt comment on Caporales security clearances. The Florida Department of Law Enforcement said Caporale went through the normal background check, though it added: A background check for (state) employment is completely different than a federal background check for high level security clearance.

In a better year for Republicans, there may have been more competition for services of people with federal experience, said Kathleen Shanahan, who has worked on transitions for two previous Florida governors, Jeb Bush and Charlie Crist. But DeSantis was one of the few bright spots in 2018 for the GOP.

Florida is an important state to the country and we have a newly elected Republican governor, Shanahan said. There wasnt a lot of success for Republicans last election and they want to work in a big state.

Texto completo: The African-American woman who took control of an Alabama newspaper that once called for the Ku Klux Klan to "ride again" has stepped down because of continuing interference from the paper’s previous leader.
Elecia Dexter, who replaced Goodloe Sutton as publisher and editor of the Democrat-Reporter in February, told The New York Times on Friday that she was stepping down to maintain her “integrity and well-being. ”
“I would have liked it to turn out a different way, but it didn’t,” she told the newspaper. “This is a hard one because it’s sad – so much good could have come out of this. ”
Sutton, 80, sparked outrage around the country when he penned a Feb. 14 editorial calling for "the Ku Klux Klan to night ride again" to clean up Washington, D. C. , from "Democrats in the Republican Party and Democrats (who) are plotting to raise taxes in Alabama. "
Goodloe Sutton: Alabama newspaper editor calls for the Ku Klux Klan to 'clean out D. C. '
‘I don’t care what they say’: Editor who called for KKK to 'ride again' won’t back down
He drew even more backlash when he doubled down on his comments in an interview with the Montgomery Advertiser.
"If we could get the Klan to go up there and clean out D. C. , we'd all been better off," Sutton told the Advertiser. "We'll get the hemp ropes out, loop them over a tall limb and hang all of them. ”
Once a lauded newspaperman, nationally acclaimed in the 1990s for his and his wife's work in bringing down a corrupt local sheriff, Sutton’s peers in journalism stripped him of past commendations after his comments were published. State leaders resolutely condemned his comments and editorials, and local residents decried the way Sutton was representing the area to the rest of the world.
Sutton, who has worked at the paper since 1964, inherited the publication from his father. He handed over control of the Democrat-Reporter to Dexter on Feb. 21 but retained ownership of the paper.
Dexter was chosen to succeed Sutton in hopes that she would move the paper “into a new direction,” according to a press release from the Democrat-Reporter.
She told CNN that Sutton sent out an altered version of the Feb. 28 issue of the paper featuring a story defending his controversial editorial and attacking the Advertiser's reporting. Dexter also accused Sutton of interfering with Thursday's paper, the network reported.
"The decision to accept the role of Publisher/Editor of The Democrat Reporter was an honor and I have no regrets," Dexter wrote in a statement obtained by CNN. "I am not discouraged; healing will come to the wonderful and loving people here. "

Is it possible for Vermont's gaming industry to grow?

Texto completo: Students in Champlain College's game design program graduate with one of the most sought after degrees in the industry. But seniors often head out of state, lured by jobs that promise "steak money" — a big payoff.
Jennifer Carlin, a 22-year-old Champlain senior, was snapped up by Insomniac Games in Burbank, California, months before graduation. She'll be designing 3D art for Marvel's Spider-Man video game platform for Sony.
"This is the best place in the world. I've never been anywhere I like so much," Carlin said of the Burlington area. "If there was a sizable studio, I'd stay or come back."
While independent startups exist in Vermont, there are no mid-to-large-sized companies building or publishing games in the state.
Tech industry professionals, as well as current and former students, said there are obstacles for startups to grow into companies that would keep more skilled game designers in Vermont.
What's at stake: getting left out Vermont could do better in a portion of the tech sector of the U.S. economy that provides well-paying jobs for skilled workers.
Wages for tech workers were more than twice the average U.S. wage in 2017, of about $55,000, according to census data.
Jobs for software developers are projected to grow 31 percent in nationally over the next decade, according to the 2018 report by the Computing Technology Industry Association, a nonprofit advocacy group.
Software development in Vermont is projected to grow 2 percent in the next five years according to Vermont's Department of Labor.
Video games, including the digital free-to-play title Fortnite and related media, earned $119.6 billion in 2018. The numbers dwarf the $43.4 billion in revenue generated by the American film industry.
"A lot of people don't view games as a serious industry, because it is not making a serious product,"said Seven Siegel, the executive director of Global Game Jam Inc. who made Forbes 30 under 30 games list for 2019.
Siegel, a graduate of Champlain College who teaches the business of game design at Northeastern University, said that Vermont has a cluster of very small companies "doing some amazing work." But gaming hotspots are typically generated by large companies where employees gained experience before leaving to form their own small businesses, according to Siegel.
Young, skilled workers leaving Vermont Vermont's population and skilled labor workforce are shrinking, according to labor and Census data, and Vermont continues to export young professionals after graduation.
Vermont was ranked in the bottom five states for tech employment by the Computing Technology Industry Association in 2018, despite Burlington's description as a 'Smart' Green Tech Hub, in The New York Times in 2016.
To stave off the brain drain, Gov. Phil Scott's administration has created initiatives like The Stay to Stay aimed at luring young active professionals to Vermont, as well as the $10,000 incentive to get remote workers to relocate in the Green Mountain State.
Education initiatives also exist to capture students' interest in the STEM disciplines — science, technology, engineering and math — and construction and health care jobs before boomers retire and leave large gaps in the workforce.
What Vermont needs The gaming students say they wanted a place to work where they can use their training to design games and find affordable rent that would allow them to pay their student loans without going broke.
Brennan Howell, 21, a senior at Champlain College who was courted by several companies outside Vermont for his environmental design skills, joked that a friend told him he'd be making "steak money," but he was thrilled for the chance to use his training professionally.
"We are all passionate about what we do," Howell said of the game designers he knows and works with.
Ryan Huggins, 24, a Champlain graduate and co-founder of Sundae Month, said he'd like to see more local "hobbyists" commit to full-time game design.
Marguerite Dibble, 29, founder of Game Theory and her business partner Shannon Mitchell, 24, both Champlain graduates, said Vermont's strengths were also its weaknesses: The distance from other game designers and producers helped give games a certain edge of weird whimsy.
"We are cut off, so we have to pave our own way," Mitchell said of Vermont's nascent game culture.
Amanda Crispel, Champlain College assistant dean for Game Development in the Division of Communication and Creative Media, said that co-working spaces specifically dedicated to game design would be a boon. She added that, in general, many tech-sector jobs could be brought to rural areas if broadband access was improved across the state.
Labor laws are confusing, prohibitive Jonathan Ferguson, an assistant professor at Champlain, explained how scaling a startup with independent contractors, such as freelance short-term skilled workers, is typical of technology startups. Companies need workers with certain skills for a window of time to fill a specific niche who then take their expertise to another company or job.
Crispel said Vermont laws governing independent contractors were unnecessarily complicated, providing a disincentive for the type of temporary workers that many tech companies need.
"Vermont's current labor laws are a often a problematic roadblock for young companies to navigate," Crispel said regarding Vermont's strict freelancing statutes.
Ferguson recognized that current laws were made to protect a traditional labor force against exploitation by big companies, but wondered if there could be some flexibility for small businesses that have yet to turn a profit.
Dealer.com didn't happen overnight The Agency of Commerce and Community Development has been attempting new strategies to address some of the needs brought up by students and designers.
ThinkInnovation Grants announced in March by the agency will fund, among other things: rural technical training, maker spaces and feasibility studies for broadband expansion.
Nick Grimley, director of entrepreneurship and tech commercialization at the agency, said the Champlain community was growing the game sector naturally and building a network of graduates, but growing an industry will take time.
Grimley said Dealer.com, a successful Burlington-based tech company that sells digital marketing platforms to auto retailers, took over 10 years to take off.
"That wasn't an overnight success story," Grimley said.

SHARE THE SUPPORT AND LOVE MUSLIMS EMBRACED US JEWS WHEN WE WERE SLAIN - NOW WE MUST REACH OUT TO THEM

Texto completo: When I saw the news from New Zealand on Friday, the cracks in my heart widened. Another act of terrorism. Another act of hate. I know something of what the Christchurch community is going through because less than five months ago, my community went through something similar. On Oct. 27, a terrorist murdered 11 members of my synagogue in Pittsburgh.
On Friday, within hours of waking up, the staff at Tree of Life in Pittsburgh convened. Congregants began calling and emailing each other. We needed to organize. We needed to do something, and not merely to help people in New Zealand, but to counter Islamophobia at home. Tree of Life Rabbi Jeffrey Myers shared this plea in an email to the congregation, "I ask you .?.?. to reach out not only to the injured communities, but to your Islamic neighbors as well."
From our own experience, we know that the hours and days that follow will bring intense bewilderment and grief. Yet, after our shooting, there was something that gave us strength. In that time of pain and fear, another story emerged, one of hope and love.
On Oct. 28, I attended a hastily organized memorial service at Soldiers & Sailors Memorial Hall in Pittsburgh. Dignitaries and politicians filled the front rows. We listened to the speeches, with their impassioned messages of support. Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto spoke, as did various clergy, representative of many different faiths. At one point, the clergy leaders - Muslim, Jewish, Protestant, Catholic, Presbyterian, Hindu - crowded on the stage together. It was a powerful sight of unity.
One speech stood out for me more than all the others. Wasiullah Mohamed, the executive director of the Islamic Center of Pittsburgh, took the stage. He announced that the center had begun raising money to pay for funeral expenses for the victims. He had already raised thousands, and in the coming weeks, the number would skyrocket to hundreds of thousands. Mohamed also made a vow: He pledged that the Pittsburgh Muslim community would stand with the Pittsburgh Jewish community. He and members of his community offered to personally stand guard at the doors of local synagogues, if necessary, to allow Jews safe passage to our places of worship and to accompany us if we felt unsafe running our daily errands.
I cannot emphasize enough the importance of these words. Muslims offering to protect Jews? To me, there could be no greater olive branch, no more profound promise of peace.
Six days later, on a Friday evening, the Tree of Life congregation gathered privately in a small chapel at Rodef Shalom, a nearby synagogue, for the first service of Shabbat. As I waited for the service to begin, people I didn't know filed in. Soon, the row behind me held a half-dozen strangers, the women in traditional abaya and hijab. I looked around and saw many Muslim families like them joining the crowd. When our congregation rose to speak the mourner's Kaddish, they rose with us. Afterward, we thanked them. They offered us their condolences and invited us to attend a service at the Islamic Center. Salaam, I said. Shalom, they said.
Not long after, Mohamed coordinated an event bringing together survivors from the terrorist attack on the mosque in Quebec with the survivors from Pittsburgh. They all wept together.
Now, in Pittsburgh, signs bearing messages of love and peaceful coexistence dot front yards, construction sites and shop windows. A popular one reads, in English, Spanish and Arabic, "No matter where you're from, you are welcome here." Others read, "No place for hate" and "Stronger than hate." A few local churches have hung banners with the words, "Love all thy neighbors."
I hope that the bonds between the Pittsburgh Jewish and Islamic communities continue to grow. The Temple Sinai synagogue and Islamic Center of Pittsburgh are co-hosting a Shabbat dinner in Squirrel Hill. And, next month, many Jews will be inviting people of other faiths to our Passover Seders. The 2 for Seder program is a national initiative launched by Marnie Fienberg in honor of her mother-in-law, Joyce Fienberg, one of the victims of the Tree of Life massacre. The hope, according to Marnie Fienberg, is to "build bridges to our neighbors."
On a Saturday in Pittsburgh, there was one message of hate, but it was followed by millions of love. When my son asked me, "Why do people hate us? Why do people hate Jews?" I was able to point to evidence to the contrary. Let us now do the same for our Muslim brothers and sisters.
We can donate to lessen the burden that lies ahead for the families of the victims. We can reach out with messages of love and support. New Zealand Police Commissioner Mike Bush encouraged Muslims to stay away from mosques; perhaps we can follow Mohamed's example and make the same offer he did, to put ourselves between our Muslim neighbors and those who might mean them harm. We promise we will continue to work with you in our common fight for the right of people of any faith to worship peacefully. Pittsburgh and Tree of Life stand with the Islamic community of Christchurch in New Zealand.

The right life insurance plan is up to you

Texto completo: Ask someone why they're investing for retirement, and they'll usually give two answers: to cover post-retirement living expenses and to help provide for a spouse after they're gone.
But what if "gone" comes far earlier than you expect? Term life insurance is a great – but often misunderstood – safety net.
Term life insurance is a policy with a fixed end date – usually 10, 20 or 30 years out, depending on when you expect the kids to be out of the house and your nest egg to be sufficient. It is meant to ensure your family can cover funeral expenses, debt and other needs after you're deceased.
I bought a term life insurance policy after my children were born, and think it's a smart move for most families. Those wanting lifelong coverage may find permanent life insurance more beneficial.
Yet industry observers have found many folks don't investigate life insurance options. TermLife2Go, which seeks to help consumers navigate this complex industry, found most people assume life insurance costs three times more than it really does.
Why? Insurance companies can't provide a quote until you answer a slew of questions about your health, habits and lifestyle. It's the verbal equivalent of a colonoscopy. Many fear filling out reams of paperwork or taking medical exams, only to find out they can't afford the insurance. It's a vicious cycle.
Knowing how companies price life insurance helps you cut through that fog. TermLife2Go has a great online resource showing how insurance rates boil down to six factors: age, health, type and term, desired payout, gender and lifestyle.
Age is simple: The younger you are, the cheaper your coverage. Rates start jumping once you hit 40 and rise as you age, with availability more limited the older you get.
Health is the biggest swing factor. Nonsmokers pay less than smokers. Duh! Good family medical histories and healthy body types help, too. The more health issues you have, the more you'll pay. Major illness in your family history can also raise costs.
The type and term of plan you want is something you can control. Term life is generally cheaper than permanent policies – less risk for the insurer. A whole life policy – good until you die, as long as you pay the premiums – costs more. These permanent policies build cash value – excess premium that accumulates within the policy. Folks say they're like savings accounts. Some policies even offer investment options for the cash value. But added costs often make these unattractive.
My advice: You're usually better off buying cheaper term insurance and plugging the savings into your 401(k). But it's a personal choice.
Payout also is within your control and simple: The bigger the payout, the bigger the premium.
As for gender, ladies have it easier. Because a woman has a longer life expectancy than a man, her premium is typically lower. The gap isn't huge, but it is noteworthy.
Finally, lifestyle, is a potpourri. It includes occupation, hobbies, how much you drive and travel (and the relative danger of countries you visit frequently). Folks with high-risk jobs such as loggers and roofers pay higher premiums than office workers. So will those with risky hobbies, including motorcycle riding, wilderness backpacking, rock climbing and boating. If you spend too much time swimming with sharks – or boating in high-risk places – premiums get pricey. Couch potatoes typically pay higher rates than active and athletic folks.
Again, whether and what type of life insurance is right for you depends on you and your family's needs. What I hope you do now is investigate.

Texto completo: There are countless books at the annual New York International Antiquarian Book Fair, of course, but also ephemera of all kinds: posters, pamphlets, calendars, playing cards. The price tags can be eye-popping -- by the end of a stroll around the fair, $2,500 for a beautiful old deck of cards started to sound, somehow, entirely reasonable.
For people with modest bank accounts, a tour of the fair amounts to a trip to an exhibit or museum, with dealers happily telling the often fascinating stories behind their wares, even if a potential sale is nowhere in sight. The 59th edition of the fair took place March 7 to 10 at the Park Avenue Armory.
In the photo above, Donald Heald, a book dealer based just a few blocks from the Armory, displays the second edition of an 18th-century book by Louis Renard, with illustrations engraved after drawings by Samuel Fallours. Printed on high-quality Dutch paper, the book cataloged the riotous marine life of the East Indies, very little known to Europeans at the time. Some balked at the images, believing they must be fictional, but scientists have verified most of the species depicted (with the exception, Heald wryly noted, of a mermaid). There were only 100 copies of this edition published, and the price tag for this copy at the fair was $145,000.
Ian Kahn of Lux Mentis Booksellers, in Portland, Me., talks to visitors at his booth, eclectic even by the steep standards of the fair. His display included an edition of James Joyce's famously difficult "Finnegans Wake" created by the artist Ximena Pérez Grobet, who cut the novel's text into strips and then knit them back together. The result, Kahn said with a smile, is "every bit as significant and comprehensible as the original novel."
Many of the books at the fair are not just limited editions, but truly one of a kind. Such is the case with this pontifical made for a bishop in Ferrara, Italy. This type of manual would normally be used for officiating at masses and other events. But this one, dating from circa 1460, was made purely for display, which accounts for why its condition remains so clean and vivid. Vincenzo Ferro of Bibliopathos explained that it's one of the rare manuscripts thought to be illuminated in the workshop of Giorgio d'Alemagna and Taddeo Crivelli.
Born in China in the late 19th century, Qiu Jin rebelled against the oppressive patriarchal society in which she found herself. In a recent obituary, part of The Times's Overlooked project, Amy Qin wrote that Qiu was "an early and fierce advocate for the liberation of Chinese women, defying prevailing Confucian gender and class norms by unbinding her feet, cross-dressing and leaving her young family to pursue an education abroad." She became such a revolutionary force that she was beheaded in 1907, accused of conspiring to overthrow the government. At the fair, the Brooklyn-based Honey & Wax Booksellers showed off a pamphlet published soon after Qiu's death, which featured her own writing as well as remembrances of her.
When Adam Davis, who sells books and ephemera at Division Leap, on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, turned to showcase various items in his booth, he said: "Follow me, and descend into the darkness of American history." And sure enough, there was the archive of Bobby Clark and Paul McCullough, a pair of Ohio friends who performed as clowns in the early 20th century. Davis explained how McCullough checked into a sanitarium and later killed himself with a barber's razor after getting his hair cut. Another archive documented the life and times of a man, also from Ohio ("really the eccentric birthplace of American art," Davis said), who would high dive blindfolded, only to actually lose his vision from the accumulated pressure of the dives on his retinas.
Davis flipped through the pages of this calendar, created by the artist George Knowlton to protest the media's coverage of the 1971 uprising at Attica prison. The illustrations are screened on to pages of The New York Times.
When you think of the Jazz Age, Houston might not be the first place on which your mind alights. This scrapbook, assembled from 1926 to 1927 and also found at Honey & Wax, documents the senior year of Mary Jane Wiseman, a flapper in Texas. The book had preprinted illustrations in it, but Wiseman and her friends added to them with striking drawings of their own. There are also poems, stories about class outings, and tickets and other souvenirs. The keepsake sold at the fair for $2,500.
More conventional literary treasures could be found at Whitmore Rare Books, based in Pasadena, Calif. Dan Whitmore, the company's founder, discussed a first edition of Walt Whitman's "Leaves of Grass," of which less than 300 were printed in 1855. "This was quite a format for an unknown guy," Whitmore said. "It was bigger than any other book of poetry." Whitmore said Whitman had strong opinions about every element of the book's design, and was closely involved with the printing process. The gold gilded frame on the cover only existed on the first edition; it was removed on future editions to cut costs.
Whitmore's first edition of T.E. Lawrence's "Seven Pillars of Wisdom," from 1926, is one of only 170 copies that were published with a complete set of illustrations. Lawrence inscribed this copy to his attorney, "with apologies for the trouble it is going to bring him." It was prescient. As the description of the book on Whitmore's website says, the lawyer would "ultimately need to handle legal issues related to trust and tax arrangements connected to the book's release."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

The biggest threat to a free press is a disbelieved press

Texto completo: The Republican corporate lawyer seated next to me leaned in to whisper. We were at a private dinner at one of those somber clubs filled with dark wood and 19th-century portraits. “Thank you for what you're doing," he said, referring to my legal work defending the First Amendment.
That happens a lot these days. I have spent 19 years as a newsroom lawyer, protecting the rights of journalists at The New York Times, The Boston Globe, and other newspapers. We live in a moment when the president attacks the press before he eats breakfast and a Supreme Court justice ruminates on why the court should make it easier to sue for libel.
I found myself in the mix with Donald Trump even before he was president. During the 2016 campaign, I wrote a letter rejecting Trump's demand that the Times remove an article about allegations by two women that he had groped them. My pointed letter went viral.
While I appreciate the support from fans of that letter and people like my Republican dining companion, there is a crisis of press freedom in this country that lawyers like me don't have the power to solve.
The movie Spotlight showed the Globe 's outside counsel, Jon Albano, winning access to critical documents that allowed the paper's investigation into the Catholic Church's coverup of pedophile priests to go forward. In general, though, press lawyers have not fared well in the popular imagination. Take Steven Spielberg's The Post, which dramatizes the effort by journalists at The Washington Post and the Times to publish the top-secret Pentagon Papers despite threats from the Nixon administration. The Post's lead lawyer is portrayed as a humor-impaired fretter, lining up on the wrong side of history as he sweats the legal details, or sometimes just sweats.
I, too, may have been racked by worry had the Supreme Court not issued a series of decisions starting with the 1964 landmark New York Times v. Sullivan — the same one now under attack by Justice Clarence Thomas. The court ruled in Sullivan that news organizations would not be vulnerable to costly libel verdicts if they got something wrong unless they had published with reckless disregard of the truth. In the two decades after Sullivan, the court repeatedly reinforced and expanded those rights by staring down challenges from those who wanted to punish the press for telling the truth.
Trump may rail about how he wants the libel laws changed, and Thomas may have nudged the cause along. But the reality is that the law of press freedom is in no immediate danger of being rolled back. Newsroom lawyers like me, reviled or loved, will be able to do our jobs.
That's how I have been able to support the important work of journalists, such as pushing back against legal threats by Harvey Weinstein so that reporting could proceed, letting loose a tsunami of sexual-assault reckoning.
The job of holding powerful interests accountable is nonpartisan. I filed more than 30 Freedom of Information Act lawsuits against the Obama administration on behalf of Times journalists (and the general public) for the release of vital public documents. We kept going with the Trump administration, seeking everything from the visitor log for the Trump transition office to the memos written by then-FBI director James Comey about his meetings with the president.
In reality, the threat to press freedom today does not lie in the law. It comes in the form of the president's repeated denouncement of American journalists as purveyors of fake news and the enemy of the people, a message played out at political rallies to cheering admirers.
The law can give the press the freedom to matter, but it can't make the press matter. A disbelieved press is little different from a shackled press: It lacks the authority to hold power accountable or mobilize public opinion against wrongdoing and misguided policy. It gets ignored.
And at some point a disregard for the press will translate into a disregard for the law of press freedom.
Too often the debate is cast as liberal versus conservative — as if the left believes in freedom of speech and the right is against it. But it was only nine years ago that, by a unanimous voice vote, all the Democrats and Republicans, liberals and conservatives, in Congress came together to pass the SPEECH Act. That law protects American publishers from libel judgments won in foreign courts where the law does not adequately protect press freedom.
We need to find our way back to that national consensus, to the shared belief that an independent press counts — no matter what our politics are, no matter whether we're watching Fox News or MSNBC.
Today's First Amendment battleground is the fight for America's hearts and minds. It is about our collective willingness to stand up, and speak out, for a free and strong press.
That's not a job for newspaper lawyers. It's a job for all of us.
David McCraw, deputy general counsel for the New York Times and a visiting lecturer at Harvard Law School, is the author of the new book Truth in Our Times: Inside the Fight for Press Freedom in the Age of Alternative Facts. He will discuss it with the Globe Magazine's Neil Swidey at Harvard Book Store on April 22 at 7 p.m. Send comments to magazine@globe.com.

Black editor who took over Alabama paper after KKK editorial brouhaha resigns

Texto completo: A black journalist who took the top job at an Alabama-based newspaper where the previous leadership ran an editorial advocating for the Klu Klux Klan to "ride again" has resigned, just weeks after becoming managing editor.

Elecia Dexter became managing editor of "The Democrat-Reporter" after its previous editor published the controversial op-ed, the New York Times reported. She was tasked with making the paper a more accurate reflection of the small town's demographic. Linden, Alabama, is roughly 59 percent white and 41 percent black, according to the latest census numbers.

Dexter, who worked at the paper as an office clerk and didn't have any journalism experience, was initially excited for the opportunity to take the paper in a new direction.

But Goodloe Sutton, her 80-year-old predecessor, still owns the paper, which has been run by his family for decades. His interference, she said, often undermined her editorial authority and her ability change the paper's direction.

Stepping down, she said, maintains her dignity and integrity.

“You can be mad at him, but we can’t keep making this about him,” the 46-year-old said. “People like him will exist. That’s just the reality of life.”

In one instance, Dexter said, Sutton emailed local news stations an alternative version of the paper's Feb. 28 publication he had edited. In his version, the cover story was a piece defending the controversial editorial about the Ku Klux Klan and criticizing the "fake news" media for what he perceived was unfair coverage of the editorial.

In an interview Friday, Linden Mayor Charles Moore said the paper and Sutton himself have done a lot to exacerbate racial tensions throughout the community.

“I would like to see them fade out, I mean, really, he’s been in the position over the years that he could’ve done a lot of good stuff here in Marengo County,” said Moore.

He's not the only one who sees the missed opportunity.

“I would have liked it to turn out a different way, but it didn’t,” said Dexter. “This is a hard one because it’s sad — so much good could have come out of this.”

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – A U. S. Navy veteran was sentenced to 10 years in an Iranian prison, according to his attorney, potentially fueling more friction between the United States and Iran.
Michael T. White, a veteran from California who has been held in the country since July, was given a decade behind bars, according to his attorney Mark Zaid, who added he is still unsure of the details that led to charges against White.
"We are just learning of information concerning Michael's sentence. After receiving news of the conviction we're in the process of hiring a local Iranian attorney to pursue whatever appeals exist," Zaid said. "It's unclear at this time whether Michael is simply an unfortunate foreigner caught in a very different legal system or being used as a political pawn. "
The Associated Press and New York Times reported White was charged with insulting Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and posting private information online.
The State Department said it was aware of White's detention but had no additional information. "We have no higher priority than the safety and security of U. S. citizens abroad," a State Department official said in a statement.
White was arrested in July after reportedly going to the country to visit his girlfriend. He was the first American detained in Iran during the Trump presidency.
More: U. S. Navy veteran has been held in Iranian jail since July, mother says
More: An American is detained or goes missing abroad. What happens next? Call President Trump?
His long sentence in an Iranian prison sets up what could be another flashpoint in a longstanding diplomatic standoff between Iran and the U. S. over detainees and hostages.
Disputes between the two countries stretch back to Iran's Revolution in 1979 when 52 American diplomats and citizens were held hostage inside the U. S. Embassy in Tehran for 444 days from November 4, 1979, to January 20, 1981.
Relations between the United States and Iran are already strained. Last year, President Donald Trump pulled out of the Iran nuclear deal, in which the U. S. and allies eased sanctions on Tehran as it gave up the means to make nuclear weapons. Since then, Trump has beefed up sanctions against the country and accused Iran of secretly working toward the goal of building nuclear weapons.
More: Exclusive: Iran open to talks with US if Trump changes approach to nuclear deal, top diplomat says
INSIDE IRAN: America’s contentious history in Iran leads to mix of anger, wonderment and weariness
Iran's foreign ministry has not released much about White's case besides that White has been held since July. Gholamali Sadeghi, an Iranian prosecutor, said in January that White was being held in connection to a "private complaint," according to the semi-official Mehr news agency.
"He is not in a good physical and mental condition," Ivar Farhadi, an Iranian who says he was held in the same prison as White before his own release in November, told USA TODAY earlier this year. Farhadi fled to Turkey, from where he relayed his encounter with the American. "If the U. S. government does not push for his freedom, the possibility of him surviving is very poor," he said in a private exchange via Twitter.
Farhadi said White is being held inside the Vakilabad Prison in the eastern city of Mashhad. He described conditions there as akin to torture. "It is filled with dangerous criminals, always cold, and cameras everywhere. The lights were always on," he said.
At least three other U. S. citizens are also being held in Iranian prisons under espionage charges the State Department has denounced as “fabricated. ” Chinese-American Xiyue Wang as well as Iranian-American businessman Siamak Namazi and his father, Baquer Namazi, are all serving 10-year sentences.

Texto completo: Wicomico County Sheriff Mike Lewis was one of several people flanking the president Friday as he vetoed a congressional resolution blocking the national emergency declared at the U.S.-Mexico border.
Lewis wrote in a Facebook post that at about 10 p.m. Thursday the White House requested he join President Donald Trump in the Oval Office at 3:30 p.m. Friday to witness the "historic moment" as this is the first time the president has exercised this power.
Lewis posted about the invitation to his personal Facebook page and the Wicomico County Sheriff's Office shared a screenshot of the post Friday afternoon, minutes before Lewis was scheduled to be in the Oval Office.
"This is not fabrication by our President," Lewis wrote. "This is not political propaganda. WITHOUT BORDER SECURITY, THERE IS NO HOMELAND SECURITY."
Lewis described the congressional resolution as "a rebuke of what lawmakers deemed an executive overreach," writing "I beg to differ."
The resolution passed the House in February and Thursday, 12 Senate Republicans joined Democrats in voting to block the national emergency declared by Trump in an effort to free up funding for a wall at the southern border.
"With the massive increase in drug seizures along our southwest border, including record seizures of crystal methamphetamine by our U.S. Customs and Border Patrol Agents, most recently the mammoth seizure of nearly two tons of cocaine in Newark, New Jersey (the largest in twenty-five years) as well as record seizures of methamphetamine, fentanyl and heroin by uniformed highway interdiction teams across the country, I'm more confident today than ever before that we must act now," Lewis wrote in the post.
This isn't the first visit to the White House for Wicomico County's top law enforcement official.
He was among 45 sheriffs who spent time in D.C. in September to encourage Congress to expand border security through legislation by participating in a media event on Capitol Hill and then a roundtable by hosted by the White House Office of Intergovernmental Affairs.
During a White House press event on that trip, Lewis and other sheriffs from throughout the country had a front-row seat to the president's response to the anonymous op-ed from a senior official in President Donald Trump's administration published by The New York Times.
"We thanked the president for his work on immigration," Lewis said to a DelmarvaNow reporter in September of that meeting. "The talks were good, and the ceremony was nice. It was very good to talk about immigration and to thank the president."
USA Today contributed to this report.

Did ethical investor lose his way?

Texto completo: Impact investing. That's the buzzword for targeting money at investments that can drive social and environmental change, as well as make a profit. While the broader socially responsible investing movement seeks to avoid doing harm — no tobacco, fossil fuel, or gun stocks, for example — impact investors want to initiate and accelerate change.
Think Bono, the lead singer of Irish rockers U2, who told CNBC in January that capitalism is “a wild beast, and if not tamed, can and has chewed up a lot of lives." Bono gave that interview at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, along with Bill McGlashan, with whom he cofounded the TPG Rise Fund. They opened the fund in 2017 with $2 billion, which made it the biggest impact investing fund by assets. 
Yes, that's the same Bill McGlashan who was charged this week in the nationwide college admission bribery scandal.
While impact investing has been around since about 2007, McGlashan took it to the next level with the Rise Fund, attracting big institutions as investors and creating a board that includes luminaries like John Kerry and Laurene Powell Jobs.
In other words, the master of the ethical investing universe is one of the alleged perps in the mother of all admissions scams.
“I was a bit taken aback that the founder of the Rise Fund was one of the parents named (and recorded) in the admissions scandal," said one investor in the private fund, who asked not to be identified. “He is the king of socially responsible, ethical investing, but like most of these folks . . . it's 'Do as I say, not as I do.' " 
Here's a feel for the kind of investments made by the Rise Fund, which has performed well, according to the investor. Brava is the maker of a “smart" oven that dramatically reduces energy use. Lead School is an Indian company that provides a “school in a box" designed for underserved communities. And Cellulant is a Kenyan company that provides digital payment services.
McGlashan joined TPG, a big private equity firm, in 2004, and he made his name and a ton of money by investing in fast-growing companies like Uber and Airbnb. His TPG Growth Fund became a powerful force in Silicon Valley.
But McGlashan has spent the past few years focused on the Rise Fund. He was in the process of raising $3 billion for a sequel fund — until the admissions scandal broke. McGlashan is accused of paying $300,000 to have his son's ACT admission test score doctored by a crooked proctor, and to have a fake athletic profile created for submission to the University of Southern California.
TPG, which oversees $103 billion in assets, told me that it fired McGlashan Thursday, after earlier putting him on indefinite leave. McGlashan, according to The New York Times, says he resigned before he was terminated.
Bloomberg reports that McGlashan, in a note to board members Thursday, said he's “deeply sorry this very difficult situation may interfere with the work to which I have devoted my life." He added that “there are aspects of the story that have yet to emerge that I wish I could share." 
McGlashan is a “key man" for the Rise Fund, but his firing/resignation doesn't trigger provisions that would allow investors to ask for their money back. However, TPG will allow investors who committed to the Rise Fund II to withdraw if they want to.
In January, McGlashan and Bono unveiled Y Analytics, a firm that will use metrics for assessing the impact of impact investing.
“Impact historically was more of a good intention," McGlashan told CNBC. But Y Analytics aims to hold the Rise Fund and other investors accountable “every day with every deal, in a way that allows us to, with substance, actually measure the output," he added.
Accountability. Yeah. 
McGlashan was all about positive returns on ethical investments. It's too bad he set ethics aside when it came to investing in his son's education.

No Rehearsal or Time to Get Comfortable

Texto completo: It's generally not a good sign for an actor when the first night of performance is also the last.
But that's the conceit behind "Nassim," a charming play running Off Broadway, in which a different actor each night performs, without rehearsal, a script written by Nassim Soleimanpour, an Iranian playwright living in Germany. At each show the game performer and the droll playwright forge a relationship of sorts, navigating barriers of language and life experience before a live audience.
The conceit behind these New York Times "exit interviews" is that artists can talk about what they experienced, and what they learned, as a run comes to a close. But we decided in this case to bend the structure, just as the play does, to reflect the experience of an actor who exits a play after just 75 minutes.
Tracy Letts is an enormously accomplished performer and writer -- a longtime member of the Steppenwolf Theater Company ensemble in Chicago, in 2008 he won a Pulitzer Prize and a Tony Award as the author of "August: Osage County," and in 2013 he won a Tony Award as an actor in a revival of "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?" He has also written for, and performed on, television ("Homeland," "Divorce") and film ("Lady Bird").
Mr. Letts lives in Chicago but is in New York for a Broadway revival of "All My Sons," in which he'll star opposite Annette Bening. He performed in "Nassim" at the request of one of its producers, Scott Morfee, who has also presented plays which Mr. Letts has written ("Bug") and acted in ("Orson's Shadow").
He did "Nassim" on a Wednesday evening, showing up after an "All My Sons" rehearsal looking slightly disheveled and appearing bemused as he awaited instructions hidden in a box on a table on the stage at New York City Center. (The show continues there, with various performers, through April 20.) Edited excerpts from a conversation follow.
What were you expecting?
Nothing. I've done a lot of improv; I've worked with TJ and Dave; and I guess I had an expectation that I would be taken care of. I couldn't imagine anybody was going to throw me on stage to humiliate me or let me flail, because that wouldn't make for a very good show.
Did you get any instructions?
Stage management sent me a little note a few days before the show that told me what stage door to arrive at, and said when you read a question, feel free to answer it, and if a word is written in all caps, stress it. They did not tell me what to wear. They did tell me to take my cellphone with me, but to put it on airplane mode.
What were you thinking as the show unfolded?
I'm a weeper, and I did think to myself, somewhat early in the proceedings, that I might have to steel myself, because I don't want to start crying. They told me later some performers do.
What about it made you think you could cry?
In the time we're living in right now, most people I know walk around trying not to cry most of the time. And the show touches on a lot of things -- storytelling, language, transcending borders, connection -- and connection with anybody is moving.
Were you worried about what might go wrong?
Audiences in a circumstance like that are so generous, so accepting, that you can't really screw anything up too bad, and they love it when you do. It's no fun to go out there and mangle somebody else's language -- that's embarrassing -- but it's built into the show, that interplay.
Did you learn anything as an actor or a writer?
The more I've done this work, both as an actor and as a writer, on camera or on stage, the more it just seems to boil down to listening. And things like "Nassim," though they might be scary on the surface, they really hone that listening skill, which is essential for storytellers.
What would you tell people who wanted to know what "Nassim" is about?
Wouldn't tell them. Part of the joy is discovering it.
What would you tell an actor who wanted to know whether to do it?
Absolutely, without hesitation. Not only because it's a good skill-building thing, but it's also just fun, and not something you do every day.
One thing I didn't expect to learn is that your son has a stuffed animal named for the actor Santino Fontana.
Nassim asked to access my pictures, and I gave him a shot of my son, and then I did not know what the next picture over was, but it turned out it was a shot of his stuffed animals which I had taken to send to a friend. And yeah, this doll showed up. Neither my wife [the actress Carrie Coon] nor I know where this doll came from, but it's a little man with curly hair, and we started referring to him as "Broadway's Santino Fontana." Haskell loves that thing.

Texto completo: Let's face it. Old newspapers pile up pretty quickly. And even if you read through every page, what are you going to do with them when you're done?
Some readers recycle the paper, while others use it to clean their windows, wrap gifts, build science projects, swat house flies, fuel campfires or, yes -- and we promise we aren't offended -- line litter boxes.
And then there's Bethann Parker, a reader from Pennsylvania who has, every day for more than a year, turned each day's edition of The Times into art.
Ms. Parker, 34, is an art student at Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts (P.A.F.A.), where she is pursuing a bachelor of fine arts degree.
She reached out to The Times to tell us about one of her art installations, which was on display at the college's Broad Street Studio in January.
The installation was a collection of a year's worth of Times newspapers structured to resemble a 12-foot-tall, 26-foot-long printing press.
[ Learn about the 17-year-old reader in Napa, Calif., who painted images of women featured in our "Overlooked" series and fashioned them into a gown. ]
In the final days of the exhibition, we visited her studio in the P.A.F.A. building to watch her work. Grabbing a black permanent marker, she scratched through each word on the front page of our Jan. 29, 2019, edition. She redacted all but the date.
Then, she dabbed a thin brush into her paint, mixing and adding color until she created the right shade of green to match the army fatigues worn by the Afghan soldiers photographed in the lead image. She covered the picture with it.
[ Read about the poet who, inspired by Times articles, writes limericks. ]
Ms. Parker lives with her husband and two children in a rural area in the Pocono Mountains region of Pennsylvania. In the grassy landscape surrounded by trees and wildlife, they focus on what she calls "self-awareness and purpose."
They hunt, garden, use well water and heat their home with firewood that they chop themselves. And without cable or internet, they spend their free time reading by the fire.
Since 2017, Ms. Parker has been spending at least one hour each day transforming a copy of The Times. She said she did this to create a conversation about how Americans receive and respond to the news.
Once transformed, the papers are assembled into a collection, sometimes arranged as stacks, wall art or most recently as an immersive experience.
Ms. Parker said she started doing this on a whim after picking up her morning paper from the grocery store one day and feeling inspired.
"It was my immediate reaction to work" on it, she said. "I just followed my instincts, and I think that so often an idea, if we just trust it, it will grow."

Texto completo: Headnote Admissions Disparities
KANSAS CITY, Mo. - They studied into the wee hours and agonized line by line over their personal essays. They took standardized tests three, four, five times to increase their scores. And last fall, after years of preparation and anxiety, the students at Ewing Marion Kauffman School, a predominantly Black school in Kansas City, submitted their college applications, hoping all their hard work would pay off.
The students at Kauffman saw their charter school as something of an equalizer. The shiny, sprawling campus opened in 2011 on the city's mostly Black and economically disadvantaged east side. Nine out of 10 students receive free or reduced lunch.
But this week the students there, and at high schools across the country, were reminded by the nation's largest admissions scandal that there is nothing equal about the process.
Some of the very campuses that parents doled out huge sums to buy places at were the ones the students at Kauffman had set their sights on. It's what the students call a harsh lesson in the limits of meritocracy.
"It's frustrating that people are able to obtain their opportunities this way," said Khiana Jackson, 17, a senior at Kauffman who has been accepted to the University of Chicago. "We can put in work from fifth grade to 12th grade, every single day, come in early, leave late, and it's still not enough."
"What does it take? You work every day, they still find a way," she said.
The case underscored the racial and economic disparities that plague access to higher education. With an expansive network of pricey college preparation courses and counselors at their disposal, wealthy students find themselves with a leg up in the increasingly cutthroat competition for the limited slots at the most prestigious universities.
In an effort to diversify their student bodies, universities are recruiting students of different racial and economic backgrounds. But there has been a backlash. For students of color who have found their qualifications questioned when they arrive at elite campuses, the case was dispiriting.
"This scandal exposed the fact that there is a misplaced emphasis on so-called affirmative action inequities, rather than privilege," said Mark Stucker, an educational consultant who hosts a weekly podcast called Your College-Bound Kid, which focuses on access and equity in education.
"That is the big travesty of college admission. People of means are able to tilt the system in their favor," he said.
At Kauffman, all 39 of the seniors have already been accepted to college. But many are waiting to hear from their dream schools and there's a feeling that the deck might be stacked against them despite all their hard work.
Jackson is still waiting to hear from her top choices, Princeton and Yale. If she does not make it to the Ivy League, it would be hard to say whether something like the admissions scandal played a role. But just knowing that "some people did get in based on how much money they could hand somebody, it's not fair," she said.
Oh Wednesday, seniors at Kauffman discussed their experiences and the fallout of the scandal. The obstacles that they had to overcome were things that the children of the parents who bribed their way into schools could never imagine, they said.
Da'Shona Martin, 18, has had to work at Panera Bread to help her family pay the bills. She sometimes has to leave school early to make it to work on the bus. And when she works, she often does not make it home until late at night, and may not get to bed until 3 a.m., she said.
That leaves little time for homework, but she was able to get accepted at Clark Atlanta University.
"You do give your best in all that you can, but you also have to kind of balance being an adult," Martin said. "To know that these parents are throwing money at all of these people and being like, 'Can you do this for my child,' it's kind of discouraging. Some of us will probably have to work our whole lifetime to see money like this."
Jennifer McReynolds and her husband prepared their son, Leonard, a senior at a Massachusetts prep academy, for college.
Their son applied to six universities, including Harvard and the University of Pennsylvania. He took the ACT six times to increase his score and spent last summer studying for the test. McReynolds and her husband, owners of a financial education company based in Atlanta, have drilled a message into their son: as an African-American student, you have to be better.
"Over and over we have told him that to be positively recognized, you have to have an incredible work ethic and you have to be above reproach," Jennifer McReynolds said. "You often hear talk about pulling yourself up by your bootstraps and that college admission is based on merit. What this story tells me is that the playing field is not level based on race and wealth."
In some cases, parents have been put in jail for lying about their residency so that their children can get into high-performing schools.
Getting into college is just one challenge for many students of color and their families. Paying for it is. another.
Kielan Watson, 17, who plans to attend Vanderbilt University, said his father told him at a young age that he would have to pay for college on his own. With that in the back of his mind, Watson said he has been seeking scholarships, which have application processes that are even more rigorous than college admissions, he said.
Watson is a finalist for a Gates Scholarship, which would be a full ride, but applying for it has been demanding.
"There's been a lot of nights where I was up thinking, 'Is this the best version of myself that I can put in here?'" he said.
The fact that some students have to scrape by while the wealthy parents listed in the indictment threw around money to get their children access disturbed the students at Kauffman.
"I was mad at the fact that parents spent millions of dollars to pay these counselors to falsify test reports and in the meanwhile, I know everyone in here is figuring out how to come up with hundreds of thousands of dollars to pay for the rest of our college education," said Jacob Esquivel, 18, who plans to attend the University of Miami.
But in a strange way, the advantages of wealth and privilege that some students may bring with them to college could make Jackson feel more confident when she arrives on a campus this fall, she said.
"I'm not going to feel like I'm at a disadvantage compared to them because I know that I have character, I have values that they haven't had to develop," she said. "They've had things handed to them. Having things handed to you versus having to earn the things you have, they create two different characters."

Texto completo: RIO DE JANEIRO - The question hangs heavily over this city: "Who killed Marielle Franco?"
It is raised in graffiti in virtually every neighborhood, emblazoned on T-shirts and written across banners displayed defiantly at mass demonstrations.
This week, just days before the one-year anniversary of her execution, prosecutors provided a partial answer, charging two former police officers with carrying out the killing. The case's main questions - including who ordered the killingand why - remain unanswered.
A year after her execution, the call for justice for Franco - a Black, gay, feminist Rio de Janeiro city councilmember who was raised poor - has morphed into a rallying cry in a deeply polarized nation for those who felt represented by her.
Her name and image have become an antithesis to the dominant political forces in Brazil as right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro settles into office.
Bolsonaro, a former paratrooper known for making offensive comments about women, Black people and gays, campaigned on a promise to improve security with measures that include making it easier to get guns, and making it easier for police to kill suspects.
But critics are afraid his policies could worsen aspects of Brazil's epidemic of violence, which includes a staggering number of people killed by police, a rate of killings of women that experts call alarming, and a systematic targeting of gay and transgender people.
The killing of Franco - who stood for many of those groups that now feel endangered - shocked and divided this violence-weary nation. But it also injected a life-or-death sense of urgency into the rights movements she espoused.
It also helped propel the political careers of Black women, including three who now sit on the council where Franco, until her death, stood alone.
"Marielle still represents, if only in memory, a threat to the status quo," said Renata da Silva Souza, her former chief of staff, who was one of the Black women elected to the council last year. .
"She embodied the people who can be killed" in Brazil with impunity, Souza said.
Franco died last year on the evening of March 14 in downtown Rio de Janeiro, when a gunman pumped several bullets into the car she was riding in as she left a work event.
She was killed instantly. So was her driver, Anderson Gomes.
Within days, Franco, 38, a rising political star from a socialist party who had little name recognition outside political circles in her hometown, became a global symbol of resistance to the rising conservative tide.
Born and raised in the Maré favela, a sprawling low-income district in northern Rio de Janeiro, Franco became a critic of police brutality and government neglect of poor areas of her city as she pursued a master's degree in public policy.
She then worked for a decade on the staff of a local council member, helping him investigate militias, heavily armed paramilitary groups made up of former and active military and police personnel.
After winning her own council seat in 2016, Franco condemned the decision by the federal government to place the military in charge of security in the state, and continued to fight against police brutality and militia presence in Rio.
After her killing, investigators and allies of Franco began to suspect the crime had been carried out by militia members.
"Militias in Rio de Janeiro today constitute an important power structure with tentacles in different spheres of power," said Pedro Strozenberg, the ombudsman at Rio de Janeiro's public defender's office.
Bolsonaro and his sons, who are also politicians, have come under scrutiny over their ties to militias. The president has in the past defended militias as a way of imposing a parallel but iron-fisted rule.
This week, after the two suspects were arrested in connection with Franco's death, the Bolsonaros found their links to the men under the spotlight, which increased the unease many critics felt with his administration.
One suspect, Ronnie Lessa, lived in the seaside condominium in Rio de Janeiro where Bolsonaro owns a home. The other, Elcio Vieira de Queiroz, had posted a photo on his Facebook page in which he appears standing alongside Bolsonaro in a friendly embrace.

Conservative lawyers steal page from progressive playbook

Texto completo: For liberals, legislative defeats are just a temporary setback until the real battle begins in court.
Whether it’s environmentalists shutting off water to Central Valley farms or the ACLU demanding sex changes for prisoners, left-wing groups have long used the courts to advance their political agenda. Now, the Resistance has taken it one step further with 46 taxpayer-funded state lawsuits against the Trump administration.
Conservatives have been quick to criticize activist judges legislating from the bench and slow to match the left’s artful use of lawfare as a political tactic — until now. Conservatives are slowly awakening to the importance of lawfare and how legal challenges can thwart the progressive agenda.
What can conservative lawfare accomplish?
Harmeet Dhillon, my RNC counterpart and California RNC committeewoman, just filed suit seeking to prevent the powerful teachers’ unions from taking dues via mandatory paycheck deductions/
Dhillon is following last year’s Janus decision, which restored the First Amendment rights of thousands of union workers. The National Education Association lost 72,325 dues-paying members. More than 6,000 teachers left the New York State United Teachers. According to federal Bureau of Labor Statistics reports, 86,000 workers in California dropped their unions over the past year. That’s a 5 percent net drop in union enrollment.
“Until Janus, California’s government unions could force public servants to pay the unions,” explains Mark Bucher, founder and CEO of the California Policy Center, which has helped educate union members about their rights. “That coercion allowed union leaders to collect $2.7 million per day — about $1 billion per year. No other political player in the state even comes close, and that makes our union leaders the unelected rulers of California.”
Conservative lawfare is challenging fake news peddled by the mainstream media. Nicholas Sandmann, the Covington Catholic High School student unfairly vilified for attending a pro-life march, filed suit against the Washington Post and CNN for “using its vast financial resources to enter the bully pulpit by publishing a series of false and defamatory print and online articles … to smear a young boy who was in its view an acceptable casualty in their war against the president.”
News reports that Sandmann’s attorneys have “sent preservation letters to more than 50 media organizations, celebrities and politicians — including The Post, The New York Times, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and actors Alyssa Milano and Jim Carrey — the first step in possible libel and defamation lawsuits.”
Last year’s Supreme Court 7–2 decision in Masterpiece Cakeshop gave the owner permission to refuse certain services based on his First Amendment claim of free speech and free exercise of religion. The conservative lawfare Alliance Defending Freedom took the case to the Supreme Court, defeating the ACLU.
Harmeet Dhillon represented the Young America’s Foundation and Berkeley College Republicans in their legal challenge to UC Berkeley’s censorship of conservative speakers Milo Yiannopoulos, Ann Coulter and David Horowitz. Under the settlement, UC Berkeley not only changed its “Major Events Policy” and security fee schedule but also paid out $70,000 in attorney’s fees. My firm along with Freedom X 1st Amendment pioneer Bill Becker represent several injured participants at the Berkeley riots when Milo attempted to speak.
Conservative lawyers throughout the country are fighting battles defending the First, Second and Fifth Amendments with success. Nonprofit law firms such as the Pacific Legal Foundation, the libertarian Center for Individual Rights and the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty are making dramatic legal precedents and proliferating. George Mason University renamed its law school the Antonin Scalia Law School. Spontaneously, hundreds of lawyers and firms are building a nationwide movement of conservative lawfare warriors to challenge the progressive agenda. This is a big step toward developing a national network of conservative and libertarian lawyers to share tactics toward defeating the left.
Shawn Steel is a trial attorney, Republican National Committeeman and former California Republican Party chair.

A Boston case put in context

Texto completo: The Boston trial of a Rwandan man charged with lying on his asylum application has revived memories of the 1994 genocide that tore apart the East African country.
Federal prosecutors say Jean Leonard Teganya ordered the killings of innocent Tutsis, Rwanda's ethic minority, during a hospital raid in the city of Butare. US law bars someone who participated in genocide from obtaining asylum.
The sheer brutality of what unfolded in Rwanda more than two decades ago still shocks the conscience, even in an age when terrorism has grotesquely stretched the definition of barbarism.
In the span of just 100 days, extremists in the country's Hutu ethnic majority killed some 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutu countrymen who refused to take part in the slaughter.
Neighbor turned on neighbor. Victims were dispatched with machetes, clubs, and bullets; others were burned. Bodies were thrown in rivers and dumped on roadways, where they remained. Many were killed while seeking haven inside churches, schools, and hospitals.
Animosity between Hutus and Tutsis had roiled Rwanda for centuries, but tension deepened during the colonial period. Belgian rulers favored Tutsis for jobs and educational opportunities, feeding resentments.
In 1959, a Hutu uprising led to the deaths of hundreds of Tutsis and displaced thousands of others.
The genocide began in April 1994 after then President Juvenal Habyarimana and his counterpart Cyprien Ntaryamira of neighboring Burundi — both Hutus — were killed when their plane was shot down.
Responsibility for the attack is disputed, but Hutu extremists blamed a Tutsi rebel group and launched a well-organized campaign of slaughter. Radio stations linked to the extremists played a key role in exhorting Hutu mobs.
The international community, including the United Nations, has faced criticism for failing to intervene and perhaps limit the bloodshed. The United States, chastened by the disastrous 1993 intervention into the Somalia conflict, blocked a move to send peacekeepers amid signs of the impending chaos. President Clinton has since apologized to Rwanda for the lack of international response.
In Rwanda today, efforts at reconciliation continue. One approach was to establish a system known as gacaca, community courts to promote forgiveness by victims and acceptance of guilt by criminals as a way to move forward.
But reminders of the madness remain. Last year, four mass graves that concealed thousands of bodies were discovered.

Texto completo: Among all the knotted problems in global food supply, it’s hard to think of one that has received more focused attention than global fisheries and the challenges of overexploitation, ecological intricacy, regulatory responses and failures.
And yet, after decades of international treaties and sustainability studies and harvest limits — some of the latter volunteered by industry — a majority of the world’s most important fishing stocks continue to decline.
Overfishing remains the key driver; other factors include pollution and habitat destruction. A typical status report will mention climate change, too, always as an afterthought, an emerging force whose impact cannot yet be calculated.
That changed at the end of February with publication in the journal Science of groundbreaking research that filtered out all other factors, then measured the influence of a warming ocean all on its own. Its unusual approach was to generate a “hindcast,” looking backward through nearly a century of data on seawater temperature and laying these against a standard measure of abundance for fish and shellfish — maximum sustainable yield — that has been in use since 1930.
The result is a set of trends, for the period 1930-2010, that of course can reasonably be expected to continue and even accelerate. And while the patterns of past change are varied, the overall picture they form is rather grim.
The basic unit in fisheries management is the stock , essentially a geographical subpopulation of a particular species. For this research, led by scientists at Rutgers University, data were considered for 235 fish stocks, representing 124 species and 38 ocean regions, that happen to account for roughly one-third of the world’s fish harvest — so, a large sample.
Of those 235 stocks, half showed declines ranging from 8 percent to 35 percent, with considerable variability among regions and some among species. One marquee example: Atlantic cod, whose numbers in the northeast Atlantic Ocean showed a 34 percent decline.
On the other hand, roughly one-quarter of the stocks showed no significant change, and another quarter showed some growth. Among these “winners” is the black sea bass, which seems to be benefiting from warmer temperatures in the shallows off New England and Canada. (This would be better news if black sea bass didn’t happen to eat a lot of baby lobsters.)
Loss: 3 billion pounds per year
Collating all the changes, the study finds an overall decline in sustainable fish catch of 4.1 percent worldwide. Doesn’t seem like much, you say? Well, it represents an annual loss in seafood production of about 1.4 million metric tons, or a bit over 3 billion pounds. It’s a loss that cannot be reversed without reversing global warming. And the pace of the decline appears to be magnified by overfishing, which has itself proved resistant to regulatory control.
The impact of these shrinking fisheries can be measured not just in higher prices for cod fillets at a Minneapolis fish counter, but also in scarcities of essential protein for people whose diets rely on fish as a local produced staple.
A Rutgers announcement of the results observes that 56 million people throughout the world are critically dependent on fisheries, because seafood provides essential dietary protein, or their livelihood, or both. This is especially so in the coastal populations of developing countries and isolated island economies, where seafood can provide as much as 50 percent of the animal protein available for human consumption.
In thinking about climate impacts on that resource, Rutgers’ Christopher Free and Malin Pinsky realized that two enormous sets of historical data could be studied in tandem. One was the record of ocean temperature measurements. The other was maximum sustainable yield, or MSY, a measure enshrined in various laws, treaties and recovery programs starting in 1930.
MSY is the product of complex calculations to arrive at a simple figure: the portion of a current fish stock that can be harvested without long-term harm to population health, expressed in catch weight. (It’s often likened to bank interest — how much you can withdraw from a savings account without reducing the principal.)
The paper acknowledges some controversy over the measure, but these arguments seem to be about its usefulness in measuring specific population characteristics and dynamics rather than overall sizes and trends. I saw no criticism on this point in science journalists’ coverage of the work, nor in the admiring comments that Free and Pinsky’s peers offered for quotation. An example from Kendra Pierre-Louis’s piece in the New York Times:
“This is going to be one of those groundbreaking studies that gets cited over and over again,” said Trevor Branch, an associate professor at the University of Washington’s School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences, who was not involved in the study. “Most of what I’ve seen before in terms of climate-change impacts have been speculative, in terms of, ‘We think this is what’s going to happen in the future.’ This one’s different.”
Geography is critical
Patterns of seawater warming have shown considerable geographic variation, so it may be unsurprising that the study found ocean region to be the variable most strongly linked to a fish stock’s fate. From the Free/Pinsky paper:
The greatest losses in productivity occurred in the Sea of Japan, North Sea, Iberian Coastal, Kuroshio Current, and Celtic-Biscay Shelf ecoregions, whereas the greatest gains occurred in the Labrador-Newfoundland, Baltic Sea, Indian Ocean, and Northeast U.S. Shelf ecoregions. The East Asian ecoregions experienced some of the largest warming-driven declines in MSY (8 to 34%) and support some of the largest and fastest-growing human populations in the world.
Interspecies differences in such factors as body size, preferred depth and habitat type didn’t seem to make much difference, although fish with faster growth rates and earlier ages of maturity were likely to respond more negatively to rising temperatures (unless they could move conveniently to cooler waters nearby).
Some of the biggest declines were found in stocks whose home waters were near the upper end of the species’ tolerable range, like Atlantic cod and herring; Pinsky has likened a species’ temperature needs to Goldilocks’ insistent that the oatmeal be neither too hot nor too cold, but just right. And one human-controlled factor was quite important:
Populations that had experienced intense and prolonged overfishing were more likely to be negatively influenced by warming, especially when they had also experienced rapid warming (>0.2°C per decade).
This interaction likely arises through several mechanisms. First, fishing can truncate age distributions and select for earlier maturation or reduced body sizes, both of which can decrease reproductive output. Fishing can also reduce intraspecific diversity, alter species interactions, and damage habitat. As a result, overfishing can magnify fluctuations in abundance due to environmental variability and interact with life history and climate variability to increase the likelihood of population collapse.
Thus, overfishing has reduced the resilience of populations to climate change, and climate change will likely hinder efforts to rebuild overfished populations….
Although the trends measured by Free and Pinsky are sure to continue, their paper stops short of making detailed projections of how this may show up in fish stocks of the future. But an especially fine piece by Erik Stokstad for Science magazine offered some thoughts on the subject:
The overall decline will most likely steepen, as forecasts have previously suggested. Since 1930, average sea surface temperatures have risen by about 0.5°C. By the end of this century, more than three times that amount of warming will likely happen, and marine heat waves will become more frequent. Although temperatures will become more favorable to fish in higher latitude waters, “those benefits can’t last forever,” Free says. “There probably is a tipping point.”
Fishery managers can help the situation. The analysis suggests stocks are harder hit by rising temperature if they have been heavily overfished. That is surprising, [German marine ecologist Rainer] Froese says, because fishing tends to selectively remove larger fish and heavily fished stocks evolve to be smaller and mature faster. These smaller fish, which are more efficient at using oxygen, might, in theory, be better able to cope with warmer water that has less oxygen. But the new study suggests these stocks were less resilient to temperature increases.
One reason could be that excess fishing wiped out the genes for coping with warmer temperatures, Froese says. Whatever the mechanism, fisheries scientists know that curbing overfishing leads to larger and more sustainable harvests. “Reducing overfishing,” he says, “is a no-brainer.”

The show is designed to expose upper-elementary, middle and high school students to opera and musical theater.
Puppetry and opera are just two of the many arts being introduced at the library. With so many programs being offered, it's impossible to list all of them here so be sure to check out the calendar on Shreve Memorial Library's website.
Here is what's new this week at the library!
Party Girls Die in Pearls by Plum Sykes (fiction)
The New York Times bestselling author of Bergdorf Blondes takes us back to the decadent 1980s in this comic murder mystery set in the tony world of Oxford University. It's 1985, and at Oxford University, Pimm's, punting, and ball gowns are de rigeur. Ursula Flowerbutton, a studious country girl, arrives for her first term anticipating nothing more sinister than days spent poring over history books in gilded libraries – and, if she's lucky, an invitation to a ball. But when she discovers a glamorous classmate on a chaise longue with her throat cut, Ursula is catapulted into a murder investigation.
Determined to bag her first scoop for the famous student newspaper Cherwell, Ursula enlists the help of trend-setting American exchange student Nancy Feingold to unravel the case. While navigating a whirl of black-tie parties and secret dining societies, the girls discover a surfeit of suspects. From brokenhearted boyfriends to snobby Sloane Rangers, lovelorn librarians to dishy dons, none can be presumed innocent – and Ursula's investigations mean that she may be next on the murderer's list.
Never Let Go by Elizabeth Goddard (fiction)
As a forensic genealogist, Willow Anderson is following in her late grandfather's footsteps in her quest for answers about a baby abducted from the hospital more than 20 years ago. The case may be cold, but things are about to heat up when someone makes an attempt on her life to keep her from discovering the truth. Ex-FBI agent – and Willow's ex-flame – Austin McKade readily offers his help to protect the woman he never should have let get away. Together they'll follow where the clues lead them, even if it means Austin must face the past he's spent much of his life trying to forget. And even if it puts Willow's tender heart at risk.Bestselling author Elizabeth Goddard keeps the stakes high, the romantic tension sparking, and the outcome uncertain until the very end.
Cry Like a Man by Jason Wilson (non-fiction)
As a leader in teaching, training, and transforming boys in Detroit, Jason Wilson shares his own story of discovering what it means to "be a man" in this life-changing memoir. His grandfather's lynching in the deep South, the murders of his two older brothers, and his verbally harsh and absent father all worked together to form Jason Wilson's childhood. But it was his decision to acknowledge his emotions and yield to God's call on his life that made Wilson the man and leader he is today. In "Cry Like a Man," Wilson explains the dangers men face in our culture's definition of "masculinity" and gives readers hope that healing is possible.

Texto completo: A prominent Vietnamese historian who criticized his government for not doing more to challenge Beijing's territorial claims in the South China Sea has been ousted from Vietnam's ruling Communist Party over comments he made on Facebook.
The political purge of Tran Duc Anh Son, an expert on Vietnam's claims in the South China Sea, is a rare window into how the party handles dissent among its rank-and-file members. It may also underline the sensitivities around Vietnam's handling of its relationship with China, its largest trading partner and former imperial occupier.
Vietnam's state-run news media reported last week that Dr. Son, who is in his early 50s and worked for years at a state-run research institute in the central city of Danang, was expelled for posting false information and violating a code that governs party members' behavior.
"I knew this day would come," Dr. Son said in an interview over a messaging service. He closed his Facebook account this week, saying he needed more time to work on book projects and transition to a new job as the director of a publishing house.
Dr. Son said the Facebook comment that got him in the most trouble was a short question he posed last September under a cartoon that obliquely criticized the government.
A character in the cartoon said: "Seventy-three years ago they corralled people to a rally to listen to the Declaration of Independence. Seventy-three years later they forbid people to gather to celebrate Independence Day."
That was an apparent reference to a famous 1945 speech by Ho Chi Minh in which the future Vietnamese president declared his country's independence from France, and an oblique criticism of the Communist Party's current leaders, who have escalated repression of political dissidents.
Dr. Son said the question he wrote underneath the cartoon -- "Is this true?" -- prompted a monthslong investigation by Danang's Communist Party Central Committee.
He said he was also investigated for a Facebook comment -- "How have things become this bad?" -- that he left under a post featuring two articles in the state-run news media about the country's education minister.
Even though many Vietnamese have low opinions of the Communist Party, its members generally avoid criticizing it for fear of repercussions that would affect their livelihoods, said Mai Thanh Son, a senior researcher at the state-affiliated Institute of Social Sciences in central Vietnam.
"The expulsion of Tran Duc Anh Son is a thoughtless decision," he said. "It's like releasing a tiger into the forest, and it contributes to stripping away the cowardly face of the ruling apparatus that the party represents."
In January, a cybersecurity law took effect in Vietnam that requires technology companies with users there to set up offices and store data in the country, and disclose user data to the authorities without a court order. Human rights advocates say Vietnam's new cybersecurity law was meant to let the government better surveil its critics on Facebook, the country's most popular social media platform.
Facebook declined to comment on the record about Dr. Son's account.
The Foreign Ministry did not respond to emailed questions about Dr. Son's expulsion from the party, including whether his criticism of Vietnam's South China Sea policies had played a role.
Vietnam has clashed repeatedly at sea with China, which claims most of the waterway as its own. Notably, in 2014 a state-owned Chinese oil company towed an oil rig to waters near Danang, provoking a tense maritime standoff and anti-Chinese riots at several Vietnamese industrial parks. The Communist Party likely fears a repeat of such anti-China-fueled Vietnamese nationalism, partly because some critics question why the government does not take a harder line against Beijing.
Chinese officials and scholars seek to justify Beijing's claim to sovereignty over South China Sea waters that encircle the disputed Paracel and Spratly archipelagos by citing maps and other evidence from the 1940s and '50s.
But Dr. Son and other Vietnamese historians argue that the Nguyen dynasty, which ruled present-day Vietnam from 1802 to 1945, wielded clear administrative control over the Paracels, decades before imperial or post-revolutionary China showed any interest in them.
Dr. Son is a former director of a fine arts museum in Hue, Vietnam's imperial capital, and a specialist in Nguyen-era porcelain. He developed an interest in Vietnam's territorial claims as a student poking around archives of old maps and documents.
In 2009, officials in Danang asked him to pursue his research on Vietnam's maritime claims on the government's behalf. He subsequently spent years traveling the world in search of material, including as a Fulbright scholar at Yale University.
Dr. Son has said the historical evidence of Vietnam's maritime claims is so irrefutable that the government should mount a legal challenge to China's activities in waters around some of the sea's disputed islands, as the Philippines successfully did in a case that ended in 2016.
"I'm always against the Chinese," he told The New York Times during an interview in 2017. But he said at the time that Vietnam's top leaders were "slaves" to Beijing who preferred to keep the old maps and other documents hidden.
"They always say to me, 'Mr. Son, please keep calm,"' he said. "'Don't talk badly about China."'
The city of Danang, where Dr. Son lives and works, once had a reputation for its powerful, family-based networks that were willing to ignore dictates from the central government, said Bill Hayton, an author of books about Vietnam and the South China Sea and an associate fellow at Chatham House, a research institute based in London.
But Mr. Hayton noted that Vietnam's current leadership, led by the Communist Party's general secretary, Nguyen Phu Trong, has lately disciplined some key Danang political figures, including firing Nguyen Xuan Anh, the head of the city's Communist Party Central Committee.
Even though Danang officials presumably supported and financed Dr. Son's research, he added, "the current Vietnamese leadership does not want to rock the boat with Beijing and seems determined to keep a lid on criticism of China's actions in the South China Sea."

People
Britney Spears is the latest pop star throwing her fedora onto the stage.
Producers of the new musical stage comedy "Once Upon a One More Time" say their show will use Spears' hit songs, which include "Oops! I Did It Again," " Baby One More Time," "Toxic" and "Stronger."
The show will have its world premiere this fall in Chicago at the James M. Nederlander Theatre. Previews begin in October.
The show's story centers on classic fairytale princesses like Cinderella and Snow White learning that being happy ever after may take some work.
In a statement, Spears says: "This is a dream come true for me!"
She joins other pop heavyweights such as Tina Turner, Donna Summer, Carole King and Cher to have their music used in a stage musical.
Stern's new book reaches No. 1 on Amazon
Howard Stern fans are clearly up for his new book.
The shock jock's "Howard Stern Comes Again" will be published May 14, Simon & Schuster announced Tuesday. It's his first book in more than 20 years and was No. 1 on Amazon.com within hours of its announcement. Stern's previous books, "Private Parts" and "Miss America," both spent months on The New York Times' best-seller list.
The publisher didn't immediately provide details about the new book. Since the 1990s, Stern has divorced and remarried. He also logged hours of interviews with a pre-presidential Donald Trump that became newsmakers in 2016. Trump spoke crudely about his daughter, Ivanka, and about Kim Kardashian. He acknowledged that he had initially supported the Iraq War, but as a candidate insisted he always opposed it.
Pilgrimage Music and Cultural Festival returns
After rain and lightning caused a cancellation last year, the Pilgrimage Music and Cultural Festival is hoping for a rebound in its fifth year with headliners The Foo Fighters, The Killers and Keith Urban.
The festival, which is co-produced by Justin Timberlake and co-founded by Better Than Ezra's Kevin Griffin, is returning to a park in Franklin, Tennessee, about 20 miles south of Nashville, on Sept. 21-22. Severe weather last year resulted in evacuations and refunded tickets.
Most of the scheduled headliners last year, including Jack White, Chris Stapleton and Dave Matthews, didn't perform.
Additional performers this year include Leon Bridges, Nathaniel Rateliff & The Night Sweats, The Head & The Heart, Live, Jenny Lewis, Lauren Daigle, Lukas Nelson and the Promise of the Real.
Tickets go on sale Friday.

Texto completo: The Republican corporate lawyer seated next to me leaned in to whisper. We were at a private dinner at one of those somber clubs filled with dark wood and 19th-century portraits. “Thank you for what you're doing," he said, referring to my legal work defending the First Amendment.
That happens a lot these days. I have spent 19 years as a newsroom lawyer, protecting the rights of journalists at The New York Times, The Boston Globe, and other newspapers. We live in a moment when the president attacks the press before he eats breakfast and a Supreme Court justice ruminates on why the court should make it easier to sue for libel.
I found myself in the mix with Donald Trump even before he was president. During the 2016 campaign, I wrote a letter rejecting Trump's demand that the Times remove an article about allegations by two women that he had groped them. My pointed letter went viral.
While I appreciate the support from fans of that letter and people like my Republican dining companion, there is a crisis of press freedom in this country that lawyers like me don't have the power to solve.
The movie Spotlight showed the Globe 's outside counsel, Jon Albano, winning access to critical documents that allowed the paper's investigation into the Catholic Church's coverup of pedophile priests to go forward. In general, though, press lawyers have not fared well in the popular imagination. Take Steven Spielberg's The Post, which dramatizes the effort by journalists at The Washington Post and the Times to publish the top-secret Pentagon Papers despite threats from the Nixon administration. The Post's lead lawyer is portrayed as a humor-impaired fretter, lining up on the wrong side of history as he sweats the legal details, or sometimes just sweats.
I, too, may have been racked by worry had the Supreme Court not issued a series of decisions starting with the 1964 landmark New York Times v. Sullivan — the same one now under attack by Justice Clarence Thomas. The court ruled in Sullivan that news organizations would not be vulnerable to costly libel verdicts if they got something wrong unless they had published with reckless disregard of the truth. In the two decades after Sullivan, the court repeatedly reinforced and expanded those rights by staring down challenges from those who wanted to punish the press for telling the truth.
Trump may rail about how he wants the libel laws changed, and Thomas may have nudged the cause along. But the reality is that the law of press freedom is in no immediate danger of being rolled back. Newsroom lawyers like me, reviled or loved, will be able to do our jobs.
That's how I have been able to support the important work of journalists, such as pushing back against legal threats by Harvey Weinstein so that reporting could proceed, letting loose a tsunami of sexual-assault reckoning.
The job of holding powerful interests accountable is nonpartisan. I filed more than 30 Freedom of Information Act lawsuits against the Obama administration on behalf of Times journalists (and the general public) for the release of vital public documents. We kept going with the Trump administration, seeking everything from the visitor log for the Trump transition office to the memos written by then-FBI director James Comey about his meetings with the president.
In reality, the threat to press freedom today does not lie in the law. It comes in the form of the president's repeated denouncement of American journalists as purveyors of fake news and the enemy of the people, a message played out at political rallies to cheering admirers.
The law can give the press the freedom to matter, but it can't make the press matter. A disbelieved press is little different from a shackled press: It lacks the authority to hold power accountable or mobilize public opinion against wrongdoing and misguided policy. It gets ignored.
And at some point a disregard for the press will translate into a disregard for the law of press freedom.
Too often the debate is cast as liberal versus conservative — as if the left believes in freedom of speech and the right is against it. But it was only nine years ago that, by a unanimous voice vote, all the Democrats and Republicans, liberals and conservatives, in Congress came together to pass the SPEECH Act. That law protects American publishers from libel judgments won in foreign courts where the law does not adequately protect press freedom.
We need to find our way back to that national consensus, to the shared belief that an independent press counts — no matter what our politics are, no matter whether we're watching Fox News or MSNBC.
Today's First Amendment battleground is the fight for America's hearts and minds. It is about our collective willingness to stand up, and speak out, for a free and strong press.
That's not a job for newspaper lawyers. It's a job for all of us.
David McCraw, deputy general counsel for the New York Times and a visiting lecturer at Harvard Law School, is the author of the new book “Truth in Our Times: Inside the Fight for Press Freedom in the Age of Alternative Facts." He will discuss it with the Globe Magazine's Neil Swidey at Harvard Book Store on April 22 at 7 p.m. Send comments to magazine@globe.com.

Texto completo: The New York attorney general has subpoenaed records from Deutsche Bank related to three large loans the bank extended to President Donald Trump's company in recent years -- and a fourth loan that Trump sought to buy the NFL's Buffalo Bills, according to two sources familiar with the subpoenas.
Those subpoenas signal a new inquiry by state regulators into the Trump Organization's financing.
The subpoena follows congressional testimony by Michael Cohen -- Trump's former lawyer and fixer -- that Trump inflated his net worth in documents he sent to Deutsche Bank while seeking loans.
The German bank also was crucial to Trump's real estate business in the last few years before he ran for president, extending him more than $360 million worth of loans since 2012. The loans let Trump buy new properties and refinance old ones, despite his history of corporate bankruptcies and disputes with lenders.
In all cases, the loans came not from Deutsche Bank's main commercial lending division, but rather from a smaller office of the bank that manages money for high net-worth clients.
Deutsche Bank had received requests for documents from the House's Financial Services and Intelligence committees. This new inquiry seems to signal that New York Attorney General Letitia James, a Democrat, is investigating the same loans.
A spokeswoman for James declined to comment Tuesday. The Trump Organization did not respond to a request for comment.
Deutsche Bank issued a statement Tuesday saying only, "We remain committed to cooperating with authorized investigations."
Last week, another New York state agency -- the Department of Financial Services, which oversees insurance -- issued a subpoena to Trump's longtime insurance broker, Aon.
Cohen had testified that the same kind of inflated financial statements were used by Trump in an attempt to lower his insurance premiums.
The Deutsche Bank subpoenas were for documents related to three Trump properties, all bought with loans from the bank, the sources confirmed.
Trump received $125 million from the bank to buy the Doral golf resort outside Miami. He got $170 million to build the Trump International Hotel inside a federally owned building in Washington. And he got about $69 million from the bank in 2014 to refinance old Deutsche Bank loans on Chicago's Trump Tower.
In addition, the sources said, the subpoena asks for documents related to Trump's attempt to buy the Bills in 2013 -- a deal that did not materialize.
During his congressional testimony last month, Cohen provided copies of "statements of financial condition," which he said were sent to Deutsche Bank in pursuit of a loan for that purchase.
"Did the president ever provide inflated assets to a bank in order to help them to obtain a loan?" Rep. William Lacy Clay, D-Mo., asked Cohen.
"These documents and others were provided to Deutsche Bank on one occasion when I was with him in our attempt to obtain money so that we can put a bid on the Buffalo Bills," Cohen said.
The "statements of financial condition" are not rigorously audited financial documents. According to a cover letter on one of the documents, they represented Trump's own estimates about what he was worth and what he owed.
Cohen said these statements exaggerated the income Trump received from commercial properties. They also included a valuation of one property -- a mansion Trump owns in suburban New York -- at $291 million, when local assessors put the value around $19 million.
In one statement from 2013, Trump doubled his own estimate of his net worth, by declaring that his name brand alone was worth $4 billion.
The subpoenas issued Monday were first reported by The New York Times. The Times also reported that Investors Bank, a New Jersey institution, had been subpoenaed for a 2010 loan it extended to the Trump Organization related to Trump Park Avenue, a residential building in Manhattan. That bank did not respond for requests for comment Tuesday.
Deutsche Bank became one of Trump's main lenders over the last 12 years -- a time when Trump was trying to shake off corporate bankruptcies and return to his previous fame as an ambitious real estate developer.
Trump began buying many properties in cash, without any public record that he'd borrowed the money. And, when he did borrow money, his financial-disclosure forms show, he relied heavily on three lenders.
One was Ladder Capital Finance, a New York investment firm that employs the son of Trump's longtime aide Allen Weisselberg. That company largely loaned Trump money to refinance existing commercial buildings in New York.
Then there was Deutsche Bank, where the private-wealth office funded new projects and refinanced Chicago's Trump Tower.
Trump's other big lender during this period, according to his financial-disclosure documents, was a company called "Chicago Unit Acquisition LLC." Trump's disclosure document says he owes this company more than $50 million, due to a 2012 transaction involving Chicago's Trump Tower.
But Trump owns "Chicago Unit Acquisition LLC."

Just one of &#xa0;the bitter pills we swallow

Texto completo: Jeanne Shaheen was preaching to the choir when the senator visited Lebanon last week to decry sky-high prescription drug prices and build support for two bills she has introduced to bring them down. Her audience at Alice Peck Day Memorial Hospital consisted of hospital executives and health care professionals who are only too familiar with the difficulty patients encounter in paying for their medications.
Sue Mooney, APD’s chief executive, recounted how an uninsured patient who sought treatment the previous day had been quoted a $4,000 price for a week’s supply of antibiotics, which was eventually reduced through the use of discount coupons to $700. Such things, Mooney said, happen every week.
Shaheen seeks to address the situation through separate bills that would end the tax deduction pharmaceutical companies enjoy for the costs of advertising and reform the patent system to increase access to lower-cost medications. The New Hampshire Democrat, who is seeking re-election in 2020, also favors legislation that would allow Medicare and Medicaid to negotiate prices with drug companies on behalf of the millions of participants in those two government health insurance programs and would permit the re-importation from Canada of lower cost medications.
Total spending by the government, consumers and insurers on prescription drugs totaled $333 billion in 2017, a 41 percent increase from 2007. A study published earlier this year by researchers at the University of Pittsburgh provides needed context for any discussion of drug price increases. They found that rapidly rising prices resulted not from expensive, innovative new therapies or from dramatic improvements in existing ones, as drug companies generally claim, but rather from price increases for existing medications. An example? Insulin, which doubled in price between 2012 and 2016.
Immaculada Hernandez, the lead author of the study and an assistant professor of pharmacy, said, “The main takeaway from our study should be that increases in prices of brand-name drugs were largely driven by year-over-year price increases of drugs that were already in the market.” Which sounds to our ear very much like a polite way of saying price gouging.
Gerard Anderson, professor of health policy and management at Johns Hopkins University, told National Public Radio that research and development accounts for only about 17 percent of total spending at most big pharma companies. “Once a drug has been approved by the FDA, there are minimal additional research and development costs, so drug companies cannot justify price increases by claiming research and development costs,” he said.
It’s no wonder then that 92 percent of Americans think Medicare should be able to negotiate on drug prices and 71 percent believe that consumers should be able to buy drugs imported from Canada, figures cited in a recent New York Times commentary by Tim Wu, a Columbia University law professor, which was headlined “The Oppression of the Supermajority.”
Wu argues that on many issues such as drug prices, large numbers of Americans are united in their beliefs instead of being polarized. Big majorities, for instance, favor higher taxes on the 1 percent, a federal law guaranteeing paid maternity leave, strong net neutrality rules and enhanced privacy protections. So, he asks, why are these policy preferences ignored?
“In our era,” he writes, “it is primarily Congress that prevents popular laws from being passed or getting serious consideration. ... Entire categories of public policy options are effectively off-limits because of the combined influence of industry groups and donor interests.”
That would appear to leave two choices. The first is to actually drain the infamous Washington swamp that’s teeming with high-powered corporate lobbyists and billionaire donors. Unfortunately, the Trump administration, while paying lip service to the notion, perpetuates its existence and extends its reach into the executive branch. The second option is to elect a president and enough members of Congress who have the resolve to ignore the special interests and pay attention to the public interest.

Joe Biden can't decide if he likes Republicans or wants to beat them up

Texto completo: Former Vice President Joe Biden is plagued by indecision. As he continues to mull whether to enter the 2020 presidential race, Biden also can't seem to decide whether he wants to run as somebody who can get along with Republicans or whether he wants to be known as a street fighter who is going to beat the hell out of them.

Throughout his career, Biden has vacillated between being a political brawler and somebody who touted his ability to reach across the aisle to cut deals with Republicans. During the previous administration, it was often Biden who played a central role in forging compromises between Barack Obama and Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., to end impasses over government spending.

As he contemplates a run for the White House, the competing impulses seem to be in conflict.

Speaking Tuesday to the International Association of Fire Fighters, Biden teased a potential run, and also riffed on the nastiness of contemporary politics.

"Mean pettiness has overtaken our politics," Biden lamented. "Sometimes it seems like we can't govern ourselves, even talk to one another. If you notice, I get criticized for saying anything nice about a Republican. Folks, that's not who we are."

Yet just a few weeks ago, Biden apologized for calling Vice President Mike Pence a "decent guy" after activist actress turned liberal politician Cynthia Nixon called him out, citing Pence's record on LGBT issues.

The apology came after a January appearance in which Biden scoffed at the idea that liking Republicans was a problem.

“I get in trouble,” Biden said at the U.S. Conference of Mayors in Washington, D.C. “I read in the New York Times today that one of my problems is if I were ever to run for president is I like Republicans. OK, well bless me, Father, for I have sinned.”

The wave of stories about how his record of having had nice things to say about Republicans, themselves only came in the wake of many harsh statements fantasizing about physically beating up Trump.

"They asked me would I like to debate this gentleman, and I said no," he said of Trump last year. "I said, 'If we were in high school, I'd take him behind the gym and beat the hell out of him.'"

Sometimes it's hard to read too much into Biden being Biden, but I do think that these vacillations speak to a central tension of his candidacy.

On the one hand, Biden's strength is as a more traditional liberal Democrat who hasn't embraced the resurgent socialist wing of the party and can work with the other side. At the same time, he wants to communicate a willingness to take the fight to Trump, a central demand of the party's base. So this seems to be at the root of these conflicting signals.

Texto completo: Award-winning journalist Maria Hinojosa, the first Latina to anchor a PBS “Frontline” report, will give the 50th Hays Press-Enterprise Lecture next month in Riverside.
Hinojosa is executive producer of “Latino USA,” a Peabody Award-winning program aired on National Public Radio. She has worked for CNN, PBS, CBS during a 30-year news career. Hinojosa’s 2011 “Frontline” report, called “Lost in Detention,” analyzed alleged abuse at immigrant detention centers.
Her topic will be “Latinos in the Media.” The free lecture is set for 11 a.m. Tuesday, April 9, in UC Riverside’s University Theatre. Reservations are suggested and free parking will be in Lot 6 on campus.
“This is a time of unprecedented emphasis on the Latino diaspora in the national media of the United States, and I look forward to the unique insights and rich historical knowledge that Ms. Hinojosa will be able to share with our UCR campus community,” UC Riverside Chancellor Kim Wilcox said in a UCR news release.
The lecture is named for Howard H “Tim” Hays Jr., the former longtime owner and publisher of The Press-Enterprise. His son, Tom Hays, created an endowment to ensure the lecture series continued after his father’s 2011 death.
Hinojosa will join the long list of journalists who have delivered the lecture. They include Katharine Graham, Ben Bradlee and Marty Baron from the Washington Post, New York Times columnist Frank Bruni, CNN President Tom Johnson, former Wall Street Journal Publisher Karen House, Chicago Tribune columnist Clarence Page, former Los Angeles Times editor Davan Maharaj, and Ray Suarez from the PBS NewsHour and Al-Jazeera.
Hinojosa has won four Emmys; the Robert F. Kennedy Award for Reporting on the Disadvantaged; and the Edward R. Murrow Award from the Overseas Press Club for best documentary for “Child Brides: Stolen Lives,” the release states.
She has been a syndicated columnist for King Features/Hearst and written two books: “Raising Raul: Adventures Raising Myself and My Son,” and “Crews: Gang Members Talk with Maria Hinojosa.” Hinojosa, born in Mexico City, was raised in Chicago.
Reservations: https://myadv.ucr.edu/forms/Hays2019

Texto completo: The home of one of Dayton’s most recognizable landmarks takes center stage in a new “New York Times” feature.
Carillon Historical Park, Dayton History’s 65-acre park at 1000 Carillon Boulevard, is spotlighted in the newspaper’s article about open-air museums.
A photo of the Deeds Carillon, a 151-foot-tall landmark near the park’s entrance, is highlighted at the beginning of the article and is the main photo in the online version of the story.
The Carillon gets its shout-out among some heavy hitters.
Other featured outdoor museums include Greenfield Village on the Henry Ford museum complex in Deerborn, Mich.; Skogar Museum in Iceland; Pfahlbaumuseum Unteruhldingen in Germany and Museum Meiji-mura in Japan.
The New York Times article talks about the Wright Brother artifacts at Carillon Historical Park, including the
1905 Wright Flyer III, as well as the group of engineers and inventors dubbed the “Barn Gang” and Carillon’s brewery.

Orville Wright designed the building that stores the Flyer.
“It was the world’s first pilot’s last project,” Alex Heckman , the Carillon’s vice president for museum operations, says as part of the article.
The New York Times article featuring the park is expected to be included in the Friday, March 15, print edition, a museum spokesman said.

Resumen: Dick's Sporting Goods, which banned assault-style weapons sales after the Parkland shooting, will reportedly pull hunting weapons at 125 stores.

Texto completo: Dick's Sporting Goods announced Tuesday it will remove firearms from 125 of its stores, according to news reports. The move follows the company's ban on assault-style weapons last year in the wake of the Parkland shooting.
CEO Ed Stack said Tuesday that Dick's will pull hunting gear from 125 stores starting in around August in response to its slumping sales in those stores, Bloomberg reported, a move that may spread to more stores next year.
It is unknown if the list of 125 stories includes any in the Southern Tier.
Dick's last year announced it would ban sales of assault-style weapons after the Parkland, Florida, school shooting and revelations that its shooter, Nikolas Cruz, had purchased a gun from a Dick's store. The company also halted sales of high-capacity magazines and guns to anyone under 21 years old.
Hunting products started vanishing from 10 Dick's stores last fall as the retailer swapped those items for products such as kayaks and baseball gear. Stack said the stores saw higher sales, margins and foot traffic than when they had guns, according to Bloomberg.
Halting assault-style weapon sales put a dent in overall sales for Dick's, the company noted last fall, a dip furthered by a weaker gun market. On Tuesday, the Pittsburgh-area company said net income for the quarter fell to $102. 6 million from $116 million in the year-earlier period, per MarketWatch.
Adjusted same-store sales fell 3. 1 percent over a 12-month period ending Feb. 2 when compared to that period the year prior, The New York Times reported.
Dick's operates 729 stores along with 94 Golf Galaxy stores and 35 Field and Stream stores, according to the newspaper.
The National Shooting Sports Foundation expelled Dick's from membership last year for "conduct detrimental" to the firearms trade group, but Stack remains undeterred in the company's direction.
"If we had a mulligan, we'd do it all over again," Stack said, per CNBC.
The CEO signed a letter last month backing a federal bill extending background checks, the network noted, and recently joined the Everytown Business Council for gun safety.

How to stop fighting about money in your marriage

Texto completo: Nobody wakes up on their wedding day and thinks, I bet we'll be divorced by this time next year. At least, I hope not.
Most of us have the highest hopes and dreams for our marriages. Sometimes, though, after a few years, reality sets in — in the form of debt, credit cards and financial infidelity — and we give up hope. That's why money problems are a leading cause of divorce in America, and it's why I'm so passionate about helping people take control of their money.
When I speak at events or talk to couples across the country, I hear time and time again that money is at the root of so much marital stress. It's amazing how appearance, status and stuff can take over our lives and ruin our relationships if we aren't careful. The good news is that there is an antidote. It all comes down to common sense.
Whether you're just dating or are already an "old married couple," here are a few tips to make money a blessing in your relationship — not a cause of stress and fights.
Work together, not separate How can you be on the same page about money if you have two separate bank accounts? Didn't the pastor at your wedding ceremony say, "You will become one"? Keeping your accounts separate is one of the most effective ways to completely wreck your financial life — and maybe even your marriage. If you want to win with money in your marriage, you must be on the same team.
Make a routine At the end of every month, sit down with your spouse for your monthly budget meeting. Plan out how you will spend every dollar for the coming month — groceries, gas, bills, everything. And don't forget to budget a small percentage of "fun" money!
Stay involved It's okay if one of you is in charge of budgeting and paying bills, but you both need to communicate and know what's going on. My husband and I use the budgeting app EveryDollar, because it's easy to use and gives us both visibility into what's going on with our money.
Be willing to say "no" If it's not in the budget, then it's not in the budget. That might mean you can't have the latest iPhone or designer shoes. Remember, it's only no for now. Once you're debt-free, you'll have more freedom to afford the things you really want. My dad, Dave Ramsey, taught me to "Live like no one else, so later, you can live like no one else."
Stay focused on your marriage You may think other couples have it all together based on what you see on social media, but their marriage may very well be stressed. Maybe they have no margin with their money, because their paycheck comes in and goes right back out in payments. Their "perfect life" may be just one money fight away from divorce. Stay focused on your marriage and your goals.
If you and your spouse are struggling right now, change won't come overnight. But you've got to start somewhere. Getting started is the hardest part, but once you start those conversations with your spouse, it will change your marriage. If you're struggling with how to approach it, check out my list of six money conversation starters to help.
So, sit down for a heart-to-heart with your spouse, be honest, and be proactive. Don't let your marriage fall apart because you're not paying attention to money issues.

Texto completo: "Hamilton" will be back, but first, Broadway's more recent hits will get their shots at opening in Pittsburgh.
The atmosphere at the Benedum Center Monday was tropical, as visitors were greeted with leis for the announcement of the 2019-20 PNC Broadway in Pittsburgh season.
Kevin McMahon, president and CEO of the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust, noted in his introduction that, in a record-breaking 2018-19 season for ticket sales, about 90,000 people saw "Hamilton" at the Benedum, and for those 90,000 or so others who missed out ... he then said "stay tuned" and left the "Hamilton" news for last.
News that the blockbuster musical "Hamilton" will return to Pittsburgh in 2020-21 was included with the lineup for next season, which opens with the Tony-nominated "Mean Girls." The Tina Fey musical comedy is based on her movie about the new girl in town and high school cliques. Announced dates have the tour opening Oct. 1 in Minneapolis before the show arrives in Pittsburgh on Oct. 28.
In March 2020 comes critical darling and last season's best musical "The Band's Visit" - winner of 10 Tonys - that finds power in intimate moments and illustrates the universal language of music.
Other shows making their first trips from Broadway to Pittsburgh are "A Bronx Tale," based on the Chazz Palminteri-Robert De Niro film; the disco queen biographical musical "Summer: The Donna Summer Musical"; and, for all you Parrotheads, "Escape to Margaritaville."
There were 1,500 Trust subscribers on hand for the announcement. They got to bounce around mini beach balls, witness taped messages especially for Pittsburgh by Ms. Fey and Jimmy Buffett, and cheer on live performances of songs from "Mean Girls," "A Bronx Tale," "Miss Saigon" and one of a very few pre-tour performances by the band of "The Band's Visit."
Samir Shukry, an Arab-Israeli singer-musician who was educated in New York, joined the Broadway company as the band's violinist and oud player. He was one of the uniformed members of the band at the Benedum Center Monday night.
"It has a big message, this show," he said. "It's so touching. I feel it every night. The show talks about reach and help, and understand. I come from the same background. I come from Israel, I speak Arabic, and I speak Hebrew. And when I sing, I sing about peace. They call me a 'bridge to peace.'"
2019-20 PNC BROADWAY IN PITTSBURGH SEASON
At the Benedum Center, Downtown, unless otherwise indicated.
* Oct. 28-Nov. 3: "Mean Girls" - Still on Broadway, the musical includes a book by Tina Fey and is directed by Tony winner Casey Nicholaw. In "Mean Girls," Cady, who grew up on an African savanna, is suddenly installed in a suburban school where the popular girls have their claws out.

Based on Mr. Palminteri's true life story, it begins in 1960, as the Pirates beat a Bronx boy's beloved Yankees in the World Series.

"JCS" imagines the final weeks in the life of Jesus Christ, as seen through the eyes of Judas.
* Feb. 4-9, 2020: "Miss Saigon" - A new production from the creators of "Les Miserables" revives the story of a young Vietnamese woman who is forced to work in a bar run by a notorious character known as the Engineer.

* March 10-15, 2020: "The Band's Visit" - In an Israeli desert town where every day feels the same, Dina daydreams about exotic films and music from her youth.

Kravetz to step down at WBUR

Texto completo: Charlie Kravetz, who over eight years as general manager of WBUR-FM led the station through a period of significant growth and some tumult, is stepping down from his job to “pursue new options," according to a joint statement released Monday by Kravetz and the station's parent, Boston University.
The statement said Kravetz's departure was a mutual decision, though it was announced at a staff meeting without him present. It came shortly after the January opening of the station's CitySpace community and cultural events venue on Commonwealth Avenue, and the recent decision by newsroom staffers to unionize.  
In a statement e-mailed to the Globe, Kravetz said that his “eight years at WBUR [were] the best in my 40-year career. I'm enormously grateful to so many colleagues who have contributed to the growth and transformation of the station."
“At a time of great challenge for journalism and media," he wrote, “WBUR has essentially doubled in impact, revenue and service to the community. . . . Now it is time for a change for me and for WBUR. I know the station will thrive because of the exceptional talent there. I will be listening and rooting for WBUR's continued success."
Later Monday, former WBUR general manager Paul LaCamera said he was also leaving the station in support of Kravetz, his colleague and friend for 40 years. He said in an e-mail to friends that Kravetz was leaving the station “under unfortunate circumstances." LaCamera said he was an “in-station consultant" at WBUR.
Staffers said they were shocked by the development. Kravetz, 66, was known to many for his hands-on management style. He paid attention to the little things, stopping reporters in the hall to ask about their word choice in a broadcast or to make suggestions about the direction of a story. He interviewed prospective employees at all levels. He even helped pick out the crimson-colored chairs at City­Space. (He was pleased that they were so comfortable, staffers say). 
Some of the station's journalists wondered whether the union organizing effort had a direct implication on Kravetz's departure, and why he did not personally address the newsroom.
“I'm shell-shocked. Where did this come from?" asked Bruce Gellerman, a senior correspondent at the station. “This is the house that Charles Kravetz has transformed. We've grown in ways that were almost unimaginable. We're a powerhouse of news and information in really difficult times, and we're growing. Why would you want to disrupt that?"
Kravetz was known for making bold decisions, and sharing his opinions openly about the direction of the station. 
“Charlie was a leader who really cared about this station, he listened to everything that we did and really put his heart and soul into being sure that WBUR is a place that's thriving," said Meghna Chakrabarti, the cohost of “On Point." “He brought an editorial mind-set that sometimes involved telling me straight that something didn't work, but he always treated me with respect and kindness. Even when I lost battles with him, I always felt like he treated me with care, support, and respect."
Boston University released a notably spare statement addressing Kravetz's departure, saying the “University recognizes and appreciates all the good and substantial contributions Mr. Kravetz made to WBUR over the years, and we wish him well in his future endeavors."
BU's senior vice president for operations, Gary Nicksa, told the newsroom that the departure would be effective immediately, and that Sam Fleming, the station's current managing director for news and programming, would act in his stead.
Nicksa said that Kravetz would be acting as a consultant for the station through June 30, and, according to journalists present, that Kravetz had been asked to “keep a distance" from the station and would not be able to “freely come and go." 
Kravetz was a veteran of the Boston news industry for more than three decades, he previously worked at NECN and WCVB-TV.  He pursued multiple revenue streams and increasingly national reach. His tenure coincided with the revolution of the audio economy through podcasts, and he established partnerships with The New York Times, Washington Post, and the Globe.
But he also oversaw a tumultuous period for the past 14 months, as the station conducted an internal analysis of its culture in the wake of the dismissal of one of its stars, Tom Ashbrook, the former host of the nationally syndicated show “On Point."
Ashbrook had been determined to have created a hostile work environment where employees were subject to “verbal assaults, intimidating actions, consistent bullying, and unwanted touching," according to an internal review. 
That review was followed by an internal “climate survey" conducted over several months and released last year by the Longpoint consulting firm. Its report identified a need for the station's general manager to have “better communication within the organization, greater accountability on the part of the WBUR leadership team, improved performance management oversight, and a greater awareness of the impact of the leadership style on station culture."
Some in the newsroom said that Kravetz acknowledged his failings in the Ashbrook case, and tried to address them. 
“Charlie was contrite in the way that the Ashbrook scandal played out," said reporter Max Larkin. “He was candid that he thought that he had failed, and there was a real effort and that it hadn't panned out."
But Larkin and others in the newsroom said that the situation led to introspection and contributed to the decision to unionize.
Larkin said he remained optimistic about the station's future. “I don't see a lot of people losing faith in what we can accomplish as a station."

ESPN bets on 'Daily Wager'; The odds are in the network's favor for a program devoted to sports gambling.

Texto completo: A decade ago, ESPN gambling analyst Doug Kezirian was toiling in Las Vegas as the host of a local radio show that specialized in sports wagering. A good friend in the city who was a pro sports bettor told him his information was so good, he should be reaching a wider audience on a TV show.
"I just looked at him and laughed and said the stigma is too severe," Kezirian recalled in a recent interview. "It's so taboo."
But his pal would have been wise to open a betting line on Kezirian's future gig. On Monday, the Los Feliz native began hosting "Daily Wager," a daily program on ESPNews running at 3 p.m. and available for streaming on the ESPN app.

It's the first regularly scheduled program from the Walt Disney Co.'s sports media behemoth solely dedicated to gaming-related information and data on upcoming contests, and it likely won't be the last, as legal sports betting spreads throughout the country.
A Supreme Court ruling in May that legalized sports betting is expected to be a boost for sports talk shows, which are the low-cost moneymakers for outlets that need programming to supplement their live play-by-play telecasts. Open discussion of odds, point spreads and other analytical data related to wagering on pro and college games each day could potentially energize the format for an audience that has a financial stake in the outcomes.
"The changes in the law open up an entirely new genre of entertainment," said Patrick Rishe, director of the sports business program at Washington University in St. Louis.
Other sports networks are already on the bandwagon. ESPN rival Fox Sports 1 has been running a daily wagering show since September. WarnerMedia's digital sports website Bleacher Report announced last month that it was building a studio inside Caesars Palace in Las Vegas where it would produce gaming-related content.
But as the country's leading source of sports programming, ESPN, with its entry into gaming-themed shows, is marking the strongest indication yet of an attitudinal shift toward a subject on which sports TV coverage has traditionally treaded lightly.
"A daily ESPN show is an important milestone," said Lee Berke, president of the consulting firm LHB Sports, Entertainment & Media. "Eight states have legalized it, with many more to come, and now a Disney-owned network is placing a seal of approval on openly betting on games."
Even when oddsmaker Jimmy "The Greek" Snyder became a household name through his exposure on CBS in the 1970s and '80s, sports league sensitivity over illegal betting limited his ability to give point spreads on the air. Play-by-play announcers usually made opaque references to the interest of point-spread bettors during games in which the win-loss outcome was already obvious.
Rishe believes a major turning point came in 2014, when NBA Commissioner Adam Silver wrote an op-ed piece in the New York Times, saying that sports betting should be legal and "into the sunlight" so it could be monitored and regulated.
"The leagues are out there doing new sponsorship deals with sports betting companies," said Ilan Ben-Hanan, ESPN vice president of programming and scheduling. "They understand this is an important marketplace for them as well."
More wagering experts have been integrated into pregame and highlight programs in recent years.
ESPN's "SportsCenter With Scott Van Pelt" has a popular segment called "Bad Beats," which humorously focuses on heartbreaking last-minute plays that result in teams failing to cover the spread.
Van Pelt sidekick Steve Coughlin will be one of the contributors to "Daily Wager," along with ESPN radio host Chris "The Bear" Fallica, ESPN.com gambling industry reporter David Purdum, Las Vegas-based handicapper Preston Johnson, fantasy football analyst Anita Marks and sports betting expert Joe Fortenbaugh.
Rishe believes programs that provide usable data for bettors have the potential to draw younger viewers who have drifted away from traditional TV for sports news. ESPN lost about 2 million domestic subscribers over fiscal 2018 ending in September, according to an annual earnings report released by Disney. This leaves ESPN with a total U.S. subscriber base of about 86 million, down from a peak of just more than 100 million in 2011.
A Bleacher Report survey found that 63% of fans ages 21 to 34 believe sports betting is acceptable, compared with 51% of fans overall.
"Just imagine you get someone on their phone watching the ESPN games show on Sling, getting their tips and then turning around and with an app placing a bet on information they just saw 30 seconds earlier," Rishe said. "That audience is out there, and they are extremely engaged."
Kezirian, 41, has been obsessed with sports wagering since he was a kid. As the youngest of five boys, he saw his two older brothers bet $5 on Super Bowl XX. After graduating with a degree in economics from Brown University, he immersed himself in the analytics and data related to gaming and became an expert as a sports journalist in Las Vegas, where "the home team is betting," he said.
Although wager-related data crunched by ESPN's statistic and information group will line the screen during "Daily Wager," Kezirian said the program's content will still be accessible to the nonbetting fan.
"We're still in Year 1 of legalization, and I think there is a new audience that is open-minded to the space, so we want to be inclusive," he said.

Texto completo: SAN FRANCISCO -- Alphabet's board of directors agreed to pay a former top Google executive as much as $45 million when he resigned from the company in 2016 after being accused of groping a subordinate.
The previously undisclosed sum was in the separation agreement for Amit Singhal, a senior vice president who ran Google's search operations until February 2016. The amount was revealed on Monday in a shareholder lawsuit accusing the board of directors of Alphabet, the parent of Google, of shirking their responsibilities by agreeing to pay executives accused of misconduct instead of firing them for cause.
The suit was part of the fallout over how Google has handled sexual harassment cases. The New York Times reported in October that Google had handsomely paid several high-ranking executives in separation agreements after they were credibly accused of sexual harassment, even though the men could have been fired for cause. In one case, Google handed a $90 million exit package to Andy Rubin, who used to head its Android division, after he was accused of sexual misconduct.
The shareholder lawsuit was filed in January in California Superior Court with redactions in the passages referring to board discussions. An amended version was filed on Monday without the redactions.
Frank Bottini, an attorney for the shareholders, said the board-approved payments were an "abdication of responsibility."
A Google spokeswoman said Monday that the company had "made many changes to our workplace and taken an increasingly hard line on inappropriate conduct by people in positions of authority." She added, "There are serious consequences for anyone who behaves inappropriately at Google."
According to the amended suit, Google agreed to pay Mr. Singhal $15 million a year for two years and between $5 million and $15 million in the third year as long as he was not employed by a competitor. He agreed to take a job at Uber about a year after his departure, then resigned from the ride-hailing company a few weeks later when the sexual harassment claim at Google became public.
Mr. Singhal left Google after an employee said he had groped her at an off-site event. Google investigated the allegation and found that Mr. Singhal had been inebriated. The company also concluded that the employee's account was credible. At the time, Mr. Singhal said he wanted to spend more time with his family and focus on his philanthropy.
Mr. Singhal did not respond to a request for comment.
The suit also cited board meeting minutes confirming The Times's report of the $90 million exit package for Mr. Rubin. A Google employee with whom he was having an extramarital relationship accused him of coercing her into oral sex. She filed a complaint, and the company's investigation found her account to be credible. The separation agreement for Mr. Rubin was also contingent on his agreeing to refrain from working with rivals.
"This lawsuit simply repeats much of the recent media coverage, mischaracterizes Andy's departure from Google and sensationalizes claims made about Andy by his ex-wife," Mr. Rubin's lawyer, Ellen Stross, said in a statement Monday. "Andy acknowledges having had a consensual relationship with a Google employee. However, Andy strongly denies any misconduct, and we look forward to telling his story in court."
The payout for Mr. Rubin sparked widespread outrage at Google and, last fall, prompted a walkout of 20,000 employees who demanded that the company improve its handling of harassment claims. After the walkout, Google ended its practice of forced arbitration for claims of sexual harassment or assault.
Google Walkout for Real Change, the organizer of the walkout, said a statement Monday: "The details of these outrageous exit packages, signed off personally by Google's executives, are a symptom of a culture that protects and awards all harassers. Google is badly in need of accountable leadership and real, systemic changes."
The lawsuit also provided a window into the workings of Alphabet's board and the power exerted by Larry Page, a co-founder of Google and Alphabet's chief executive.
According to the suit, the board's compensation committee proposed paying Mr. Rubin a salary of $650,000 in April 2014 with the opportunity for him to get a bonus of more than double his salary. At the time, Mr. Rubin was an adviser to Google and no longer running the Android business.
The lawsuit said Mr. Rubin had declined to accept that pay package until he had spoken to Mr. Page. In August 2014, Mr. Page awarded a $150 million stock grant to Mr. Rubin.
Eight days after the $150 million grant was awarded, a Google official emailed the board committee asking for approval of Mr. Rubin's compensation. Without any additional documents, the committee members -- Paul S. Otellini, Intel's former chief executive, who died in 2017; John Doerr of the venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins; and Ram Shriram of the venture firm Sherpalo Ventures -- said they had approved it, according to the suit.
Mr. Doerr and Mr. Shriram did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Google awarded Mr. Rubin the grant even though there was an active investigation into his misconduct. When Mr. Page ultimately decided to part ways with Mr. Rubin, the $150 million stock grant was a sizable bargaining chip that Mr. Rubin used to negotiate his exit package since an executive's stock compensation is often taken into consideration during settlement talks.
Through an Alphabet spokesman, Mr. Page declined to comment.

Resumen: Medical experts have warned the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that the agency's guidelines counseling physicians to limit opioid prescriptions are having a dramatically negative impact on chronic pain patients who use the medication in high doses but have not become addicted. The experts warned the CDC that, as a consequence, patients who benefit from the drugs have been forced into painful physical withdrawals, suffered renewed and debilitating pain and endure a life so miserable that suicide has become a viable option. CDC critics are urging the agency to issue modified guidelines urging physicians to loosen the current restrictions and leave treatment decisions to the individual judgment of physicians.

Texto completo: Chronic pain patients are being denied the opioid medication they desperately need
The opioid crisis has been devastating. But there are two sides to the story.
One side has received the bulk of attention from public officials and media outlets. It's the story about the widespread and unnecessary prescriptions that lead to gross abuse by addicted patients, too many of whom have ended up dead.
The other side of the story is largely unknown, just starting to get the attention it deserves.
Medical experts have warned the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that the agency's guidelines counseling physicians to limit opioid prescriptions are having a dramatically negative impact on chronic pain patients who use the medication in high doses but have not become addicted.
The experts warned the CDC that, as a consequence, patients who benefit from the drugs have been forced into painful physical withdrawals, suffered renewed and debilitating pain and endure a life so miserable that suicide has become a viable option.
CDC critics are urging the agency to issue modified guidelines urging physicians to loosen the current restrictions and leave treatment decisions to the individual judgment of physicians.
In response, the CDC contends that its guidelines urging limiting opioid prescriptions are reasonable.
Given the national attention and official concern devoted to this subject, it should be no surprise that the too-frequent dispensation of opioid prescriptions has swung the other way into the not-frequent-enough dispensation of opioid prescriptions.
After all, opioids have been cast in recent months as approaching public health threat No. 1, and they may be. But that should not obscure the fact that this medication also can serve a perfectly valid purpose.
The letter, written by 300 medical experts, was signed by three former White House drug czars. Other signatories include addiction specialists and pain specialists.
"The CDC really does need a rigorous evaluation of this because we don't know how big the problem is. Minimally, we need some level of clarification on the appropriate use of the guidelines," said Dr. Michael Botticelli, the Obama White House drug czar.
The New York Times reports that opioid prescriptions have "fallen dramatically" since the CDC issued new guidelines to primary care physicians three months ago. Further, the administration wants the numbers to drop by another one-third over the next two years.
But the doctors say just pushing the numbers down leaves out those who use them in a constructive way. Those patients are described as so physically dependent on them that they will suffer severe withdrawal if their doses are dramatically reduced. The key, however, is that the medication helps these individuals function in the face of the pain they endure.
Addiction medicine is complicated. So it's not at all clear that heavy reliance on opioids is proof of dangerous dependence. One addiction specialist defined addiction as a "behavioral maladaptation where the medication takes over their lives and they continue to use despite negative consequences."
That sounds much different from a patient with pain issues who uses opioids to live a normal life.
The CDC guidelines are purely advisory, but they do recommend physicians press their patients to taper their use down, prescribe opioids for only a short time and reduce dosage strength.
The CDC may not view that message as a flashing red light. But it's easy to see why physicians, acting out of a sense of caution, would.
In that context, it's time to rethink the current approach. No one wants to see real opioid abuse continue. At the same time, no one benefits when patients who need them to live relatively normal lives unnecessarily suffer.

For a growing number of Americans, socialism is OK

Texto completo: You wouldn’t expect democratic socialists to hit the brakes when it comes to social justice.
But in late February members of Inland Empire Democratic Socialists of America learned how to fix brake lights so they could offer that bit of auto repair service, for free, at an upcoming community event. Working tail lights, they reasoned, would mean fewer police traffic stops and, possibly, fewer fatal outcomes for people of color.
Auto repair is just one part of the chapter’s public outreach about an ideology that, increasingly, is finding a more receptive public audience. Polling shows more Americans, especially Democrats, view socialism more favorably than capitalism, even if they have sometimes wildly different ideas of what socialism is.
“It just doesn’t have the same stigma,” Kimberley Coles, a political anthropologist at the University of Redlands, said of the word “socialism.”
“It doesn’t mean there won’t be … rhetoric and seeing what sticks in terms of the insults.”
A Gallup poll from last summer found that for the first time in 10 years, Democrats had a more positive view of socialism (57 percent) than they did of capitalism (45 percent). That shift among Democrats drove down the overall view of capitalism.
“A majority of Americans have retained a positive view of capitalism over the past eight years, but this year’s 56% positive rating is by four points the lowest recorded since 2010,” Gallup reported. “Americans’ positive views of socialism have varied only between 35% and 39%, with (2018’s) reading of 37% right at the trend average.”
Gallup also found that among young people (ages 18 to 29) capitalism had slipped from 68 percent approval in 2010 to 45 percent approval last year.
Gallup isn’t the only pollster seeing that trend.
Thirty-one percent of Democrats in a YouGov poll from last August said they would be “comfortable” with a socialist presidential candidate, compared to just 8 percent for Republicans.
The same YouGov poll found 44 percent of Americans had a favorable view of capitalism, down from 52 percent in 2015. Americans age 18 through 29 are likelier to see the word “socialist” as a compliment while Americans age 65 and older are more likely to consider it an insult, although the 65-and-up group views socialism more favorably now (25 percent) than in 2015 (15 percent), according to YouGov.
Capitalism’s polling dip — and the corresponding rise in approval for the label “socialism” — coincides with ballot box gains by politicians who are connected with the political organization Democratic Socialists of America.
Running as Democrats, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Rashida Tlaib in 2018 became the first Democratic Socialists of America members to win congressional seats. Democratic Socialist Bernie Sanders’ stronger-than-expected 2016 presidential campaign fueled an effort to turn the Democratic Party leftward, a trend that’s continued with Ocasio-Cortez’s celebrity status.
Nationally, Democratic Socialists of America had just 5,000 members prior to November 2016, but passed the 40,000-member mark following Ocasio-Cortez’s upset in New York’s June 2018 primary, according to published reports.
The organization’s Southern California connections include chapters in the Inland Empire, Orange County and Los Angeles. “Our chapter is continuing to grow and evolve from its humble roots,” the Inland chapter collectively wrote in response to emailed questions. “Fresh faces appear at every monthly member meeting.”
It’s not just about faces and personalities, either.
Ocasio-Cortez’s proposal for a Green New Deal, along with proposals from many candidates for universal health care, higher taxes on the rich and other socialist-favored ideas, figure to loom over the crowded race for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.
It’s also already become a rallying cry — perhaps even the central theme — of Republican election efforts.
During last month’s State of the Union address, President Donald Trump drew applause from supporters when he invoked socialism as a pejorative.
“We are alarmed by new calls to adopt socialism in our country,” he said before declaring that “America will never be a socialist country.”
Fears of socialism “could become the kind of rhetorical touchstone of (President Trump’s 2020) campaign that sounding the alarm about ‘criminal illegal aliens’ was in 2016,” The New York Times reported.
“Socialism is the greatest vulnerability by far that the House Democrats have,” Rep. Tom Emmer of Minnesota, who chairs the National Republican Congressional Committee, told the Times.
Socialism replaced Hillary Clinton as the main villain at this year’s Conservative Political Action Conference, which featured a “bread line” mocking Ocasio-Cortez.
“They want to take away your hamburgers,” former White House adviser Sebastian Gorka warned conference-goers. “This is what Stalin dreamed about but never achieved.”
What is socialism?
Americans fight not only over whether socialism is good or bad, but over what it means. Seventeen percent defined socialism as “government ownership of the means of production,” that was about half the number of Americans who used that definition of socialism in 1949, Gallup reported last October.
“Americans today are most likely to define socialism as connoting equality for everyone, while others understand the term as meaning the provision of benefits and social services, a modified form of communism, or a conception of socialism as people being social and getting along with one another About a quarter of Americans were not able to give an answer.”
The Democratic Socialists of America is “a ‘big tent’ organization,” the Inland chapter said. “Members may embrace a variety of tactics, theoretical frameworks, and emphases, but ultimately work toward a classless society undergirded by an economy in which production and the fruits of production are shared by all.”
To fight what the chapter sees as misconceptions – socialism is “inherently totalitarian” or a “mere matter of welfare state programs,” for example – members stress that socialism is organized from the bottom-up, outside of government, and that socialism emphasizes freedom, including “the ability of working people to resist the private tyranny of the firm and its owners,” the chapter said.
Socialism made Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez, not the other way around, the chapter said. “Their ideas were popular because the moment was right for a socialist alternative, after a major recession, stagnant wages, and widespread discontent with the status quo.
“Our chapter as a whole is sympathetic to Bernie/AOC, but we seek also to hold them accountable to their promises, and members may find that their views do not completely overlap with theirs. This being said, among elected officials, their reform agenda is the closest in spirit to our movement …”
Besides fixing brake lights, the Inland chapter, which estimates it has 30 to 40 active members, also stumps for Medicare-for-all at events like Riverside’s monthly Public Arts Walk. It also hosts movie screenings with discussions afterward – “Sorry to Bother You” was a recent feature – and members have traveled to Mexico to help migrants at the border.
“A new idea”
Coles and Harold Clarke, a political science professor at the University of Texas at Dallas, think socialism’s surging popularity, especially among millennials, is rooted in recent history.
“Socialism’s kind of a new idea for them and it’s detached from a lot of the economics and brutal politics of the past,” Clarke said.
Millennials “aren’t shaped by Cold War politics, much less attachment to political parties,” Coles said. “They’re interested in a la carte political ideas, rather than being labeled as Republicans or socialist.”
They also grew up during the Great Recession of the late 2000s, when capitalism’s flaws “were highlighted in political rhetoric,” Coles added. “Socialism has historically always offered a critique of capitalism and highlighted the inequality of economic and political power.”
The Trump backlash also might be a factor. “With his hotel empire, numerous side businesses, and history of shortchanging employees and contractors, current President Donald Trump perhaps encapsulates capitalism at its worst … ,” Eillie Anzilotti wrote in an article about the Gallup poll results for Fast Company magazine.
She added that Trump alone likely doesn’t explain the drop in capitalism’s popularity, especially among young people. “Since the 1970s, wages (adjusted for inflation) have barely risen, while (the) cost of living has skyrocketed across the U.S. Meanwhile, the top 1% of earners in America … has captured 85% of income growth that’s occurred since 2009.”
The uptick in socialism’s popularity could be a lasting trend, Coles said.
“I feel that these millennial voters are … more interested in learning from others (and are more) cosmopolitan in being willing to take ideas from lots of places,” she said. “It seems that people are interested in new ideas and socialism is offering one set of solutions.”

Andrew Rannells on his early days in Austin

Texto completo: Andrew Rannells is coming to Austin. He’ll probably wear a lot less makeup than the first time he was here.
This year, Zach Theatre took an iconic blonde wig out of the box for its latest production of “Hedwig and the Angry Inch.” Almost 20 years before that, now-Tony-nominated actor Rannells smeared the title character’s blue eyeshadow and red lipstick all over his face, playing a punk-rock bombshell in the Austin theater’s first mounting of the rock musical.
Rannells conjures back to life that career break — along with other professional milestones and more than a few dishy tales of the men he loved along the way — in a new memoir, “Too Much Is Not Enough: A Memoir of Fumbling Toward Adulthood,” out this month from Crown Archetype. Rannells’ book tour will swing through Austin on March 18; he’ll speak and sign copies at
BookPeople.
When I recently spoke with Rannells by phone ahead of his visit, he called his stint as Hedwig an “amazing opportunity.” In the early 2000s, a big break eluded the actor, who started his search for fame handing out headshots at New York City stage doors. By then, Rannells certainly had paid his dues — a youth spent in Omaha’s children’s theater circuit, a tumultuous summer stock stint in a barn, a dinner theater staging of “Grease,” a tour of the country playing an offensively flamboyant villain in “Pokèmon Live!” Hardly the Broadway lights glowing in his dreams when he moved to NYC as a Marymount Manhattan College freshman. Hardly the Playbill credits he envisioned after he dropped out of school to chase those dream-lights without distraction.
During a stint of unemployment, Rannells searched casting call notices religiously. “Hedwig” and Austin called his name. He writes about snagging an audition for a show he loved in a town he loved after weeks of searching.
Rannells found himself in an audition room full of men in various states of drag. When called up, he sang Bruce Springsteen’s “Born to Run” for the director of “Hedwig,” Austin theater mainstay Dave Steakley. (Steakley, Zach’s producing artistic director, also directed the theater’s most recent “Hedwig” production.) Rannells writes that Steakley watched the actor singing with rapt attention.
He booked the gig.
“I will always be grateful to Dave for whatever he saw in me,” Rannells says. The actor’s time in Austin left him with more confidence in his performance abilities when he eventually returned to New York, he says.
But “Hedwig” was also a “very isolating show,” Rannells says. His father had just died when Rannells found himself alone in Texas, still unpacking his feelings about the loss. Eventually, Rannells’ mother and his sister, Natalie, came to Austin to see the production about a month into its run. Rannells writes about working day and night once he arrived in Austin, leaving little time to find "weird" Austin's spots worth showing off. The family ended up at a local IHOP, he writes in the book.
It’s still probably not a great idea to rely on Rannells for Austin breakfast recommendations. Though he’s returned to the city since, he never really got out and about while starring in “Hedwig.”
“My big regret of my time I spent there,” Rannells says.
He’s come a long way since the young and hungry days recounted in “Too Much Is Not Enough.” There are the Broadway credits, of course. Originating the role of Elder Price in “The Book of Mormon.” Replacing Jonathan Groff as King George in “Hamilton” for a spell. Roles in “Boys in the Band,” “Falsettos,” “Hairspray” and “Jersey Boys.”
Don’t forget Rannells’ screen credits, either. He’s brought snark and smiles to main roles in HBO’s “Girls” and Ryan Murphy’s short-lived sitcom, “The New Normal,” as well as a slew of guest spots. He’s currently a star and producer of Showtime’s “Black Monday” with Don Cheadle and Regina Hall, and he also voices a character on Netflix’s animated “Big Mouth.”
Though Rannells has experience as a Mormon missionary and a tyrannical king, “author” is a new job title. “Too Much Is Not Enough” is his first book. He wrote a well-received essay about learning of father’s death during a hook-up for the New York Times’ “Modern Love” series in 2017. That’s included in the memoir, as is another essay published in the Times this month titled “The Tallest Man I Ever Loved.”
Earlier than those stories in the book, Rannells writes about a harrowing sexual and emotional experience he had with a middle-aged actor in Omaha, which started when he was 16 years old and continued until he left for New York. The man took advantage of him, Rannells says, and the prolonged situation left the teenager feeling overwhelmed. Rannells includes in the book a message to both adults and young people who have found themselves in similar positions: You can always stop something that you don’t want to continue. It’s the kind of message common in memoirs of queer people, speaking back to their younger selves or writing the messages they wish they’d heard when they were younger.
“It was very difficult to write that, but therapeutic in many ways,” Rannells says. “I put a lot of blame on that kid. I need to forgive that person.”
There’s only so much real estate available in a book, Rannells says, and he got caught up in details sometimes. It was a real lesson in self-editing, but there wasn’t anything left on the cutting room floor that the actor wishes had made it into the finished product. He feels like the book says what he needed it to, especially in the acknowledgments, where he gives his mother, Charlotte, due praise.
“I was not the easiest child,” Rannells says.
In his memoir, Rannells shares every story of his past with the same candor: a painful fight with his mother (in that Austin IHOP) following his father’s death, his grandmother’s struggle with dementia, trysts with boys that lasted a while and those that didn’t.
Bill Clegg, Rannells' agent, also wrote a memoir (“Portrait of an Addict as a Young Man”), and he advised Rannells to disclose to his family the shared experiences that made it into the book just before it was time to publish. Though he did wait a little bit (“for the last minute”) before having those conversations with his family, Rannells says he also showed some passages to his sister, Natalie, earlier in the process. Doing so was important to him, but he points out that the stories in the book are his version of events.
“It was hard,” Rannells says of reconstructing his life story. “To have to edit down your own life is a little tricky.”
The period of time Rannells covers in “Too Much Is Not Enough” stops short of one satisfying milestone, incidentally. Long after leaving Austin, he eventually brought Hedwig to life again — on Broadway in 2014.

Texto completo: EAST LANSING - Ellis Hay knew one of answers had to be "Bea Arthur."
"She is only Bea to be kind of famous enough for a crossword that I could find," he said.
The 2016 graduate of East Lansing High School made his New York Times debut this week with the publication of his B-themed crossword puzzle.
Hay began work on the puzzle nearly a year ago. The Temple University music composition junior fittingly used music terms and homophones as well.
Clue topics ranged from pop culture, as in "Backstreet Boys member ____ Dorough," to political, "Brooklyn-born Supreme Court Justice."
It took Hay more than a week to finish the puzzle. He submitted it last spring and learned in July that it would be published. The puzzle ran in the New York Times on Monday.
"My mom was excited to tell everyone she knows about it," he said.
The former quiz bowl team member said he can usually complete the New York Times crossword Monday through Thursday. The puzzle gets increasingly challenging as the week progresses. He can sometimes complete the Friday and Saturday puzzles, though not always.
Hay isn't a lifelong crossword puzzle fiend. He started in earnest in college and has submitted a few puzzles to the Times.
"I haven't submitted any in a few months, but, probably during the summer, I can focus a little bit more on puzzles."

Ellis Hay, an East Lansing High School graduate, had his first crossword puzzle published in the New York Times March 4.

Texto completo: As you grumble about your lost hour of sleep this weekend, just remember: Don't blame Benjamin Franklin. Despite legend, the nerdiest founding father did not invent daylight saving time. (He suggested cities wake residents earlier on summer mornings by the sound of cannon fire, so perhaps it's best he didn't get his way.)
No, the reason you may need an extra cup of coffee Sunday is because of World War I. And golf.
Changing clocks in the summer was first proposed around the turn of the 20th century by two guys who came up with it separately, though for the same reason. New Zealander George Hudson and Englishman William Willett both wanted more time after work in the summer for their sunlight-required pastimes -- in Willett's case, hitting the links, and in Hudson's, collecting bugs. And really, why let time itself keep you from your hobbies?
Neither men's proposals gained much traction, however, until the outbreak of the World War I. The Germans were the first to do it, on April 30, 1916, as a way to save on coal-powered lighting in factories. British politicians moved to follow suit two days later and had set their clocks forward by the end of May. Most other European countries weren't far behind.
Time was a little slower to change in the United States, which did not join the war until 1917. Stockbrokers and manufacturers made a flurry of patriotic posters in support of daylight saving. But railroad companies, afraid confusion around the time change could cause a deadly crash, were adamantly against it. So were farmers, who worked by the sun anyway and did not want interactions with the clock-keeping world to get screwy.
"If you're a farmer, you can't just go work an hour early, because you need the sunlight to see what you're doing, especially in those days," says David Prerau, author of "Seize the Daylight: The Curious and Contentious Story of Daylight Saving Time." This was especially hard on dairy farmers, who would have to start milking cows in the dark to meet train schedules for delivery.
"Plus, the sun, beside giving light, it gives heat, and it drives off the dew on a lot of the things that have to be harvested. And you can't harvest things when they're wet," Prerau says.
The stockbrokers won; a bill passed Congress and President Woodrow Wilson signed it. But the first nationwide time change suffered from some seriously unfortunate scheduling. It was March 31, 1918 -- Easter Sunday. Newspapers published instructions on how and when to set clocks forward, and churches posted signs out front warning parishioners.
The Chicago Tribune called it "a lie that will benefit you and your country," which is a pretty weird way to put it.
At 2 a.m., a reception at Madison Square Garden marked the occasion, and in the U.S. Capitol, a few senators stayed awake with the Sergeant-at-Arms to reset the Ohio Clock.
The next day, things went surprisingly smoothly. "Some churchgoers were an hour late, but no baseball games were called on account of darkness," reported The New York Times. "Those looking to the sky at nightfall expecting to see a miracle were disappointed."
By the next year, the war had ended, and many thought daylight saving time should end with it, Prerau says. Lawmakers representing farmers introduced nearly two dozen bills to repeal it; one Mississippi congressman urged, "Repeal the law and have the clocks proclaim God's time and tell the truth!" A New Jersey congressman who supported it told people to think of the veterans coming home from the war, "Are they not deserving of the extra hour of recreation?"
A repeal sailed through the House, cleared the Senate and landed on Wilson's desk. He vetoed it, saying it could cause an economic downturn.
A vote to override the president's veto failed, but haters were unbowed. They passed another repeal bill, which the president vetoed again. But this time, they were better prepared, getting the two-thirds majority in the House and Senate needed to override the president. (All of this happened in a month; Congress used to be productive!) Daylight saving time was dead.
So if they got rid of it, then why are you late to brunch now?
Cities like New York and Pittsburgh passed their own daylight saving time laws, and it was brought back nationally for a little while during World War II. As The Post's Michael S. Rosenwald has written, all the time laws among cities and states got so messed up that in Iowa, there were 23 different daylight saving dates, depending on what town you were in. In 1966, President Lyndon B. Johnson finally smoothed it out, making daylight saving time the law of the land.

Texto completo: Jordan Peele's second writer-director outing, “Us," opens March 22. Lupita Nyong'o plays a woman, Adelaide Wilson, who takes a seaside vacation with her family. Things get complicated when four people break into their house. Things get even more complicated because the four people look just like the Wilsons.
“Us" is a big deal. What makes it a big deal is that Peele's debut was “Get Out." Considering the plot, maybe “Us" should be called “Get In."
It's hard to believe now, but before “Get Out" opened it wasn't a big deal. Half of the comedy team of Key & Peele has written and directed a . . . horror movie? OK, fine.
Well, very fine, actually. “Get Out" was that rare triple play: a critically acclaimed box-office hit that turned into a cultural event. People didn't just watch “Get Out" and like it. People watched it and liked it and talked about it. It also won Peele a screenwriting Oscar.
You could argue that “Get Out" was a quadruple play, since it was a directing debut by an actor. Peele follows in a long line of stars who have stepped behind the camera. Sometimes the results have been impressive — or more than impressive (two words: “Citizen" and “Kane"). Sometimes they've been glorified ego trips (too many examples to list).
There have been performers whose directing careers came to equal or even surpass their careers in front of the camera: Orson Welles, John Cassavetes, Woody Allen, Jerry Lewis, Clint Eastwood, Penny Marshall. Will Peele join that group or remain primarily known as a performer? A more interesting question: Will “Us" be an example of sophomore slump or sophomore jump? Although the former is more common, the latter has been known to happen.
Here are five contemporary actors who've tried directing — and a look at how their first and second films comparatively fared.
BARBRA STREISAND
Yentl (1983)
Director, co-writer
Box office ranking for 1983: 18
Oscar nominations: 5
Wins:1, best music
Critical response: good but not overwhelming. Pauline Kael and Roger Ebert both liked it a lot. Isaac Bashevis Singer, author of the short story on which “Yentl" is based, did not. He found “artistic merit in neither the adaptation, nor in the directing."
The Prince of Tides (1991)
Director
Box office ranking for 1991: 16
Oscar nominations: 7, including best picture
Wins: none
Critical reception: very good. Even better, Pat Conroy, author of the novel on which the film is based, inscribed a copy “To Barbra Streisand: The Queen of Tides."
Slump or jump: jump
KEVIN COSTNER
Dances With Wolves (1990)
Director
Box office ranking for 1990: 3
Oscar nominations: 12, including picture and best director
Wins: 7, including best picture and best director
Critical reception: very good, though “Goodfellas" should have won the best picture Oscar, and Kael wrote, “Kevin Costner has feathers in his hair and feathers in his head. The Indians should have called him 'Plays With Camera.' "
The Postman (1997)
Director
Box office ranking for 1997: 93
Oscar nominations: none
Wins: none
Critical reception: Don't ask.
Slump or jump: Slump is too weak a word.
MEL GIBSON
The Man Without a Face (1993)
Director
Box office ranking for 1993: 62
Oscar nominations: none
Wins: none
Critical reception: unenthusiastically respectful. In Newsweek, David Ansen called it “such a noble, well-intentioned little film — a cross between 'Dead Poets Society' and 'The Phantom of the Opera!' done as an after-school special — that one feels like an ogre picking on it."
Braveheart (1995)
Director
Box office ranking for 1995: 18
Oscar nominations: 10, including best picture and best director
Wins: 5, including best picture and best director
Critical reception: mostly very good. The New York Times review called it “one of the most spectacular entertainments in years."
Slump or jump: Jump is too weak a word.
GEORGE CLOONEY
Confessions of a Dangerous Mind (2002)
Director
Box office ranking for 2002: 120
Oscar nominations: none
Wins: none
Critical reception: mostly positive
Good Night, and Good Luck (2005)
Director, co-writer
Box office ranking for 2005: 89
Oscar nominations: 6, including best picture, best director, and best original screenplay
Wins: none
Critical reception: very positive
Slump or jump: jump
BEN AFFLECK
Director, co-writer
Gone Baby Gone (2007)
Box office ranking for 2007: 108
Oscar nominations: 1, best supporting actress (Amy Ryan)
Wins: none
Critical reception: very positive
The Town (2010)
Director, co-writer
Box office ranking for 2010: 36
Oscar nominations:1, best supporting actor (Jeremy Renner)
Wins: none
Critical response: positive
Slump or jump: slight slump, with a big jump coming with Affleck's next movie, “Argo" (2012)

Don’t blame the rain for deaths at Santa Anita, the problem is much more complicated

Texto completo: It wasn’t just the stormy weather that led to the deaths of 21 horses in less than three months at Santa Anita racetrack. More likely, it was a perfect storm, one that’s been brewing for years.
The heavy rains since December contributed, certainly, but an analysis of two decades of horse racing statistics published by the California Horsing Racing Board shows the world renowned track has weathered worse with fewer fatalities.
Just two years ago, 17 inches of rain — 2 more inches than this year — fell from December to March. Eleven horses died at the Arcadia facility in that time period.
Only two of Santa Anita’s five deadliest years from 1997 to 2018 correspond with higher-than-usual rainfall. The worst year, 71 deaths in 2011-12, was during the drought.
In this case, the various factors at play include the types of horses, the track, the training and racing schedules, and the weather’s impact on each of those, said Rick Arthur, equine medical director for the California Horse Racing Board. Necropsies on the horses will also determine if the animals had any pre-existing conditions or medication in their systems.
“It’s like a plane crash,” Arthur said in an earlier interview. “There’s seldom one factor that explains everything, and I wouldn’t expect that to be the case here.”
New protocols announced
On Friday, Tim Ritvo, chief operating officer of the Stronach Group, which owns Santa Anita and several other racetracks, announced a series of new protocols to increase safety when racing resumes later this month.
Consultants are still reviewing the weather’s impact on the main track, but the initial changes extend far beyond the rainy season. Under the new rules, Santa Anita will scrutinize horses’ medical records — even during training — and control the number of horses on the track for high-speed exercises.
On Saturday, Santa Anita announced its main dirt track would reopen at 5 a.m. Monday for limited workouts — “joggers and gallopers” only.
“Over the past four days, we’ve been able to do a great deal in terms of amending the soil and inspecting it,” said Dennis Moore, who served as track superintendent at Santa Anita until Dec. 31 and recently returned to analyze the racing surfaces.
“Things can happen even under perfect circumstances,” Moore said, “but from everything we’ve been able to learn, this track is in outstanding condition and it’s ready for training.”
Santa Anita’s fixes mirror successful changes made by the Del Mar Thoroughbred Club, which cut back on horses on the track in the mornings and tightened up its inspections in the aftermath of a disastrous 2016 summer season, with 17 deaths in 23 days.
Experts: Overuse of track a factor
The increased traffic at Santa Anita is likely one of the main factors in the deaths, according to experts.
Bad weather can upset the consistency of a track, but it also forces horses into the barns, sometimes for days, according to Richard Tedesco, a veteran track consultant with experience as a superintendent at most of Southern California’s racetracks.
Disruptions make trainers and owners anxious to get their horses back out as soon as possible. Once the gates reopen, there’s a flood of horses all at once on a track already weakened by rains.
“You’ve got all of these guys foaming at the mouth to get their horse ready again,” Tedesco said. “The dirt gets pretty well chewed up.”
Too many horses running at the same time is an accident waiting to happen, he said.
Santa Anita shut its track down for two days at the end of February in response to outcry over the first 19 deaths. Track expert Mick Peterson, of the University of Kentucky’s Agricultural Equine Programs, examined and cleared the course as “100 percent ready” before the track reopened Feb. 28.
The horse racing statistics website Equibase tracked 862 workouts in the six days following the reopening. On March 1, 326 horses hit the track before the afternoon races began. Then another 70 ran in those events. The 20th horse died in a race the next day. On March 5, 273 horses worked on the track where the 21st horse died.
“That’s quite a bit,” Tedesco said of the workouts. He estimates an average day is about 150 horses.
In Europe, horses exercise at training centers and race mostly on the weekends, Tedesco said. But in Southern California, the loss of venues has condensed much of the thoroughbred racing to Santa Anita. Trainers say they don’t change locations as often as they did in the past.
Santa Anita scaled up and extended its season when Hollywood Park closed in 2013.
“The bulk of the dates went to Santa Anita,” said Jack Liebau, the director of Los Alamitos Thoroughbred Racing in Orange County. “You have a lot more stress on the track and it’s difficult.”
‘Real art form’ to maintain a track
Heavy rains, a well-worn track, and even the loss of Moore as track superintendent may have all played a part, Liebau said.
Moore, who most recently has been serving as a consultant at Del Mar and Los Alamitos, helped Del Mar with its crisis in 2016. He returned to Santa Anita as a consultant earlier this month to help with the track inspections.
“It’s a real art form to maintain a track in a safe manner,” Liebau said. “Everybody seems to be very happy that Dennis is back.”
Fewer deaths at Los Alamitos
At Los Alamitos Race Course, which runs quarter horses and thoroughbreds, 10,354 horses raced last year, compared to 8,922 at Santa Anita, according to statistics compiled from reports by the CHRB.
Los Alamitos also uses a dirt main track, like Santa Anita, and in the past three months experienced heavier rain. At both venues, the track is tightly compacted to keep out moisture. This creates another potential risk as the harder-than-expected surface can throw off a horse’s fragile footing.
Since Dec. 26, only three horses have died on the track at Los Alamitos, compared to the 21 at Santa Anita. That’s despite the fact that the state’s data shows Los Alamitos had 23 percent more deaths per year on average in the past decade.
Though the tracks share similarities, the big difference between the two venues is the daily traffic. Nine of Santa Anita’s 21 deaths occurred during training on the dirt track, seven were during races. The other five happened on the venue’s storied turf track.
Los Alamitos has added more thoroughbred racing in recent years, but the majority of horses at the venue are quarter horses. These sprinters of the racing world have less intensive training regimens than thoroughbreds, Santa Anita’s bread and butter.
Los Alamitos had less than 200 workouts in the same six day period as Santa Anita’s 862, according to Equibase.
‘Everybody worried’
Last week, the New York Times reported that trainers at Santa Anita appear to be more demanding than counterparts elsewhere in the state. Santa Anita averages 3.02 workouts per start, compared with 0.88 workouts per start for horses running at Gulfstream Park in Florida and 0.42 at Aqueduct in New York.
“Ninety-nine percent of the trainers take very good care of their horses, there’s less than 1 percent that you have to watch,” said Tedesco, the track consultant. “Owners spend a lot of money, the trainers want to win races. It all comes down to, ‘Let’s keep them going.’ “
Everyone at the track is working to ensure safety of horses during training and the races, he said. Tedesco said he’s fielded concerned calls from racetrack officials across the country..
“What is going on is really bad for the industry,” he said. “It’s gotten everybody worried, everywhere.”

Texto completo: It wasn’t just the stormy weather that led to the deaths of 21 horses in less than three months at Santa Anita racetrack. More likely, it was a perfect storm, one that’s been brewing for years.
The heavy rains since December contributed, certainly, but an analysis of two decades of horse racing statistics published by the California Horsing Racing Board shows the world renowned track has weathered worse with fewer fatalities.
Just two years ago, 17 inches of rain — 2 more inches than this year — fell from December to March. Eleven horses died at the Arcadia facility in that time period.
Only two of Santa Anita’s five deadliest years from 1997 to 2018 correspond with higher-than-usual rainfall. The worst year, 71 deaths in 2011-12, was during the drought.
In this case, the various factors at play include the types of horses, the track, the training and racing schedules, and the weather’s impact on each of those, said Rick Arthur, equine medical director for the California Horse Racing Board. Necropsies on the horses will also determine if the animals had any pre-existing conditions or medication in their systems.
“It’s like a plane crash,” Arthur said in an earlier interview. “There’s seldom one factor that explains everything, and I wouldn’t expect that to be the case here.”
New protocols announced
On Friday, Tim Ritvo, chief operating officer of the Stronach Group, which owns Santa Anita and several other racetracks, announced a series of new protocols to increase safety when racing resumes later this month.
Consultants are still reviewing the weather’s impact on the main track, but the initial changes extend far beyond the rainy season.

Texto completo: [Video: Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom - Official Trailer Watch on YouTube.]
The latest installment in the "Jurassic Park" franchise gets its television debut. And four drag queens help a bride who's in need in a new TLC special.
What's on TV
JURASSIC WORLD: FALLEN KINGDOM (2018) 8 p.m. on HBO; also on streaming platforms. As is the case with almost every film franchise, the "Jurassic Park" sequels haven't found the same success as the original 1993 movie. This fifth iteration was narrowly saved by mixed reviews: Variety said it plays like a 1970s "disaster movie run amok." Vulture said the movie is "chasing its own tail." And A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times that it "is in most respects a dumber, less ambitious movie than its immediate predecessor, and also, for just that reason, a little bit more fun." Set three years after 2015's "Jurassic World," the film follows Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard), an activist, and Owen (Chris Pratt), an animal-behavior specialist, as they try to rescue dinosaurs from a fictional island before it erupts. Once they arrive and track down the creatures, they realize they have been duped by bad guys who have sinister plans for the reptiles.
MICHAEL JACKSON: THE JURY SPEAKS 9 p.m. on Oxygen. Questions about Michael Jackson's alleged pedophilia have been dominating the headlines after the HBO documentary "Leaving Neverland" debuted last Sunday. But accusations surfaced many years before the documentary, which focused on two men who were coming forward with abuse allegations against the pop star for the first time. In 2003, Jackson was accused of molesting a 13-year-old boy at his Neverland Valley ranch; two years later, he was acquitted of all charges. In "The Jury Speaks," part of a true crime series that aired in 2017, five members of the jury from the trial explain why they found Jackson innocent and Thomas Mesereau, Jackson's lead lawyer at the time, details how he won the case.
DRAG ME DOWN THE AISLE 9 p.m. on TLC. In this new wedding special, four drag queens -- Alexis Michelle, Bebe Zahara Benet, Thorgy Thor and Jujubee -- come to the rescue as Emily, a bride-to-be, prepares for her big day. Struggling with a tight budget and body image issues, Emily second-guesses her dress and worries about the venue. Over the course of three weeks, the queens, all of whom are former contestants on "RuPaul's Drag Race," give Emily a makeover, help her plan a fantasy wedding reception and encourage her to find her "inner queen."
What's Streaming
SUBURBIA (1984) stream on Amazon or Hulu; rent on Amazon. Penelope Spheeris ("The Little Rascals," "Wayne's World") directed this coming-of-age drama about a pack of young Los Angeles runaways (among them: Chris Pedersen, Bill Coyne and Jennifer Clay) who live in a rundown sanctuary of sorts off Interstate 605. Together they keep each other safe and steer clear of a local vigilante group that blames them for all of the neighborhood's problems. In his review for The Times, Vincent Canby applauded the cast's performances and called the movie cleareyed and compassionate.

How The Daily Uses Tape

Texto completo: [Want to get this by email? Here's the sign-up .]
Listeners have come to expect it. Lots of it.
Tape.
Audio of real-world events as they unfold. Press conferences. Speeches. Newsreel. Archival recordings.
It's woven into almost every episode of "The Daily" to transport listeners to a time or a place, to create urgency and immediacy.
Here's an example from Friday's episode about Michael Jackson. Our guest, the Times culture critic and "Still Processing" co-host Wesley Morris, introduces the film "Leaving Neverland," and tape begins to weave in and out around him.
Michael: What do we need to talk about this week?
Wesley: It's probably "Leaving Neverland," this Michael Jackson documentary.
Tape: Not a trailer or even a single clip of this new documentary has been released ahead of its debut today, but that has not slowed the buzz behind it.
Wesley: I became aware of this movie as it was making its way towards Sundance in January.
Tape: It's probably right now the most talked-about film at Sundance.
What's the point of tape like that? There are a few explanations. First, it alleviates the burden of the guest having to tell the entire story him- or herself. I could listen to Wesley talk all day, but it's a lot to ask him to deliver every detail of a complex tale. Tape is the ultimate storytelling sidekick. Here, the tape does the work of explaining how much the world awaited this film -- or dreaded its arrival. Second, the tape deepens our understanding of the reaction and impact around it. There really were protests over "Leaving Neverland" at the Sundance Film Festival. Don't take our word for it. The tape brings you there.
Every week, producers spend hours hunting for the perfect tape, diving into old archives, watching congressional hearings on C-Span. We're an obsessive bunch.
On Wednesday night, when we learned that the U.S. trade deficit had reached a historic high, we went looking for tape. There was no news conference announcing the news (so no tape there), but we knew President Trump had bemoaned the trade deficit, over and over, in speeches for two years. The hunt was on for the perfect archival moment. Three of us fanned out across the internet until we found it. Here's how it sounded at the end of Thursday's episode:
Tape of President Trump: Thanks to our powerful trade policies, the trade deficit is falling and falling and falling.
Michael: On Wednesday, the Trump administration said that the U.S. trade deficit has surged to the highest level in history, despite two years of "America First" trade policies aimed at reducing it.
Tape of President Trump: The days of plundering American jobs and American wealth -- those days are over. They're over. America first. America first.
Which brings me to the final point about tape. It allows us to trust you, the listener, not hit you over the head with an argument or needlessly over-explain something. Here was the president boasting that the U.S. trade deficit keeps falling, when, it fact, it keeps rising, so much so that it's at an all-time high. You can absorb this contradiction without us having to point it out.
Is there ever such a thing as bad tape? Oh, yes. When we started the show, people who listen to "The Daily" in their cars told us that any time we played tape of police sirens, they feared a cop was behind them, ready to pull them over. Whoops. We've stopped playing that tape.
Talk to Michael on Twitter: @mikiebarb.
______
On "The Daily" this week
■ Neal Katyal, a lawyer who wrote the rules governing the Mueller investigation, on how its end might be the beginning of multiple new investigations.
■ What happened to Lindsey Graham, Trump's enemy-turned-cheerleader? From the senator's own point of view: nothing at all.
■ When the Pentagon comes knocking, how will Silicon Valley respond? Kevin Roose digs up a cautionary tale for Big Tech.
■ The Green New Deal set off a political roller coaster that has landed somewhere unexpected for Democrats.
■ "For a long time, Michael Jackson controlled this story. He had all the power." Wesley Morris grapples with why the world has, for so long, looked the other way.

"You have it backwards"
In Wednesday's episode, Kevin Roose explored the backlash from engineers at tech companies like Microsoft and Google when their bosses pursue military contracts. Ed Warren, a former military officer who lives in Bethlehem, N.H., wrote to us about how we framed the episode: "There was an implicit assumption that doing business with the military may be unethical. You have it backwards. As someone who served, the idea that I would be sent to battle with anything less than the best tools and technologies feels deeply unethical. War is an awful, miserable duty but an unavoidable necessity in this world. The fact that some Silicon Valley software engineers don't want to expend their efforts on tools that help the military execute that mission is ivory tower nonsense."
Here's Kevin's response:
"Ed, thank you for your note. I really appreciate you listening and taking the time to respond. I'm sure many people in Silicon Valley would agree with you that working with or for the U.S. military is a moral duty. We also have a long national tradition of making accommodations for people who oppose war for ethical or religious reasons, like the thousands of conscientious objectors who were allowed to perform alternative service during World War II instead of doing combat duty. (Fun fact: My grandfather was one of these people.) I can't speak for the engineers in Silicon Valley, but they could be viewed as part of this tradition -- people who might believe the military has a right to modern technology but who, for deeply held personal reasons, don't want to take part in building it themselves."
______
Introducing our pod-cat
"Will the owner of a black and white cat please remove it from studio C ASAP? Litter box too!!!" That was the clarion call the "Daily" team got on Slack last Friday from Brad Fisher, our technical manager, who is a cat lover -- but also a lover of expensive audio equipment. The owner of the cat asked to remain unnamed. The name of the cat: Felix.

Texto completo: Love him or hate him, you gotta admit that Jerry Seinfeld is an important figure in the world of comedy.
And with the comedian headed to Pittsburgh's Benedum Center on Friday, we figured we would step back and look at the key moments that brought Jerry to the 65th most populous city in the United States. (We're gaining on ya, Henderson, Nev.)
So, let's dive in to the history of Jerry Seinfeld.
Summer 1976: First stand-up gig
We're skipping Jerry's birth (April 29, 1954, in Brooklyn, by the way) because that's just something that happens to everyone. Instead, we're kicking it off with the first time he stepped to the mic in front of a crowd. It was in the summer of 1976 at The Comic Strip in Manhattan.
FirstStandupPic
1977: First TV appearance
Jerry managed to get himself on "Celebrity Cabaret," a nationally syndicated TV show filmed in New York. The show, hosted by Richard Hall, had established stars introducing stars of "tomorrow." Jerry was introduced by singer-actress Julie Budd. We're not sure what's funnier here: Jerry's stand-up bit or his huge Harold Ramis glasses. (Oh, and check out those graphics.)
FirstTV
1980: Plays Frankie on 'Benson'
You didn't know? Oh, yeah. The great Jerry Seinfeld appeared in three episodes of the ABC sitcom "Benson." And it was significant for Jerry only in that he had such a horrible experience (he was fired after his third episode) that he pretty much had resigned himself to never being on another sitcom again. We all know how that turned out.
BensonImg
May 6, 1981: First 'Tonight Show' appearance
By 1981, Johnny Carson was the undisputed king of late-night TV. If a comedian could do his stand-up routine on the show and get an acknowledgement from Carson, a career was made. Jerry nailed it his first time out, earning an "OK" from the host. George Shapiro, Jerry's manager, says the comic calls the appearance the "most important and most significant in his career."
FirstTonight
1981: First HBO appearance
Back in the late '70s and early '80s, HBO was known for its "Young Comedian" specials. Many future comedians got their first taste of national exposure here: Richard Lewis, Paula Poundstone, Harry Anderson, Howie Mandel, Carol Leifer, Steven Wright, Bill Maher, and many more. In 1981, Dick and Tom Smothers hosted the 6th annual special and introduced Jerry as "Jerry Steinfeld." Perfect.

July 27, 198?: Jerry first does Larry David's material
OK, so the actual year is not really clear, but we're thinking it happened sometime in the '80s that Larry David, the other half of the creative genius behind "Seinfeld," and Jerry discovered their comedy minds meshed well together. According to comedian Carol Leifer, it was at a birthday party for her that Larry David gifted her with 2 pages of jokes. However, she says she was too drunk to do the material and handed it off to Jerry, who got great laughs with it. A team was born.
LarryJerryPic
Sept. 5, 1987: His first special
In 1987, Jerry got his first solo comedy special, "Jerry Seinfield's Stand-up Confidential." The HBO show featured the comic doing his stand-up mixed with various skits -- all set around some notion of "life as seen through a comic's x-ray specs." We don't get it, either. But it was important in that it showed Jerry could do more than just stand up and tell jokes.
ConfidVid
Aug. 31, 1988: The pitch
Shapiro pens a letter to the NBC brass saying, "Call me a crazy guy, but I feel that Jerry Seinfeld will soon be doing a series on NBC." The move was done without Jerry knowing about it. "I had kinda decided I was just gonna be a comedian," Jerry said in the 2004 documentary "Seinfeld: How it Began." Even though Shapiro had been sending letters like this for years, he said, "This time it triggered a meeting." And the rest is television history.
The Letter
July 5, 1989: 'The Seinfeld Chronicles' debuts
The show about "nothing" got it start on NBC as a summer replacement. Originally planned as a 90-minute special about how a comic gets his material, Larry and Jerry decided a 30-minute version actually suited the material better. In the pilot episode, Jerry worries about a woman he just met and what her signals mean with his friend George (Jason Alexander) and neighbor Kessler (Michael Richards). Yep, it was Kessler then and not Kramer (that change came later).
FirstSceneVid
May 23, 1991: 'The Chinese Restaurant' episode
It wasn't until Season 2, episode 11 that "Seinfeld" found it's true hilarious voice. The whole episode was Jerry, George and Elaine (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) waiting for a table at a Chinese restaurant. That's it. But it was one of the funniest (and has become one of the most beloved) episodes in the series. The show achieved a level of success that few shows reach. The final episode aired May 14, 1998.

Sept. 12, 1993: 'Seinlanguage' released
Jerry becomes an author, as his first book hits the shelves -- and The New York Times best-seller list. The Bantam book was, according to an Amazon review, "a collection of Jerry's musings on everything from relationships to shushing in movie theatres."
SeinLanguage Pic
July 19, 2012: Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee
Jerry combined his passion for classic cars with his wit and a laid back interview style to create what's probably the first talk show on the road. Literally. Each episode pairs a vintage car with a fellow comedian. The two hit the road for coffee and humorous banter. Fittingly the pilot episode had Larry David as Jerry's guest. Other guests have included Carl Reiner, Alec Baldwin, Sarah Silverman, Chris Rock, Tina Fey, Amy Schumer, and -- most notably -- Barack Obama. The series is still running, it its 10th season, now on Netflix.

Thankfully, Jerry is still making important dates. Here's hoping that Friday's event in Pittsburgh has a special meaning.

Texto completo: More than a dozen restaurants are being celebrated as among the best women-led eateries in New York City on International Women's Day.
Online reservation site OpenTable teamed up with the James Beard Foundation to highlight notable females in leadership positions at city restaurants, including head chefs, owners and corporate leaders. Their list of 17 eateries features an eclectic mix of flavors and locations, from authentic Japanese cuisine to gourmet mac and cheese, from Harlem to Prospect Heights. 
"We are completely honored to be on this list," says Bessou owner Maiko Kyogoku, who grew up cooking traditional Japanese meals with her mother. "I have worked in restaurants for over 10 years and some of those environments were pretty harsh. It's been a conscientious effort as an owner to create a work culture where everyone feels welcomed."
Here are some of the women who are making their mark on the New York restaurant scene.
Mokbar (Park Slope)
With locations both in Chelsea Market and in Brooklyn, chef and owner Esther Choi provides traditional Korean food - inspired by her grandmother's homemade meals - to two boroughs. With humble beginnings as a ramen stand in Chelsea Market, Choi expanded her brand in 2014 with the opening of Park Slope's Mokbar. Choi appeared on Zagat's 30 under 30 list of "Rock Stars Redefining the Industry." She serves Korean staples such as dumplings and kimchi.
Dirt Candy (Lower East Side)
Vegetarian spot Dirt Candy takes credit for triggering the trend of meat-free establishments throughout the city. Amanda Cohen, the owner and head chef, is a James Beard-nominee who has appeared on both "Iron Chef" and "Iron Chef Canada."
While lacking an a la carte menu, the vegetable-oriented eatery offers two tasting options, featuring five to 10 courses of hand-selected delicacies such as Korean fried broccoli, popcorn beets and pumpkin pad thai. The restaurant, which was the first vegetarian establishment to be given two stars by The New York Times, also offers a brunch and dessert menu offering a healthy twist on classic mimosas and cheesecake.
Maiko Kyogoku, Bessou (NoHo)
Nestled on a quiet corner between Bond and Bleecker streets, Bessou serves platters of traditional Japanese food with a familiar New York flavor. Owner Maiko Kyogoku says that it is the commitment to authenticity to that brings new visitors to her restaurant, but it is the unique Bessou twist that turns a casual visitor into a familiar face at the establishment.
"We're a Japanese restaurant that takes the flavors of New York as inspiration, and I think a lot of people find our food healthy and delicious," says Kyogoku. "It hits the notes of comfort food."
The Beatrice Inn (Greenwich Village)
Originally a speak-easy in the 1920s, The Beatrice Inn is now known for its preparation and presentation of meats. While the establishment has always boasted its lush atmosphere and celebrity clientele, it credits New York chef Angela Mar for its wide acclaim among food critics. Mar incorporates a rich blend of fruits and herbs to compliment the fine meats served at the Inn, garnering her a feature in The New Yorker, as well as Food & Wine's best new chefs in the country. 
Yves (TriBeCa)
Chef Alex Baker originally trained at culinary school in Paris, working at several restaurants in France such as Spring and Le Chateaubriand. Baker began debuting her dishes at Rebelle in New York in 2015, which she helped to open. At Yves, the young chef reinterprets French cuisine with a fun flair, a relaxed attitude reflected in the sunny ambience of the TriBeCa spot.
Murray's Cheese Bar (West Village)
With locations across Queens, Brooklyn and Manhattan - including a new mac & cheese pop-up in Greenwich Village - Murray's has been a staple in New York since 1940. Restaurant gurus Beth Ann Coulton, Elizabeth Chubbuck, and Melissa Iacono lead the corporate end of the cheese-inspired restaurant, which offers everything from sliders, fondue and grilled cheese.
Porsena (East Village)
Inspired by classic Italian dining rooms and the quaint neighborhood restaurants one would find while perusing the streets of Florence, Porsena pairs artisanal pastas with both traditional and newly imagined sauces. Chef Sara Jenkins has been in the industry for over a decade, crafting her signature meat dishes as well as timeless Italian classics such as spaghetti con le vongole.
El Quinto Pino (Chelsea)
At Spanish tapas bar El Quinto Pino, chefs and owners Alex Raij and Eder Montero boast a unique twist on tradition while still maintaining rich and authentic flavor. Raij is a celebrated chef at Txikito, highlighting regional tastes from Andalusia, Asturias and Menorca.
Cosme (Flatiron)
Chef Daniela Soto-Innes won the James Beard Rising Chef of the Year award two years after opening her first restaurant, Cosme, at the age of 23, and went on to land a spot on the World's 50 Best Restaurants List. Soto-Innes combines local and seasonal Hudson Valley ingredients with classic Mexican recipes to create fresh and authentic dishes - a tactic she replicates at her new restaurant location in NoHo.
ATLA (NoHo)
Soto-Innes' NoHo location is a relaxed, upbeat rendition of the upscale Cosme that put her name on the map. Functioning as an all-day eatery, ATLA features lighter menu options such as stuffed avocado and a pambazo sandwich, as well as floor-to-ceiling windows that serve as the perfect Instagram filter for photo-worthy food.
Glasserie (Greenpoint)
Located at the tip of Greenpoint, Glasserie serves Mediterranean recipes passed down through generations with new-school flair. Sara Conklin, owner of the glass warehouse-converted restaurant, grew up in places such as Dubai, Cyprus and Kuwait, contributing a diverse flavor palette that adds a twist to the establishment's Middle Eastern menu.
La Palapa (East Village)
The Astor Place spot for authentic Mexican cuisine is the brainchild of Barbara Sibley, who was raised in Mexico City. The chef and artist began building her repertoire at French restaurant La Tulipe before channeling her upbringing into fresh tacos and other authentic Mexican cuisine.
Modern Love Brooklyn (Williamsburg)
Chef Isa Chandra Moskowitz crafts vegan comfort food in Williamsburg. Moskowitz focuses her energy at Modern Love Brooklyn on crafting plant-based versions of classics - such as the fan-favorite mac and cheese made with cashew cheese - made with natural ingredients.
Meadowsweet (Williamsburg)
Owners, chefs and husband-and-wife team Stephanie Lempert and Polo Dobkin opened Meadowsweet under the Williamsburg Bridge in 2014 with a dedication to provide customers with the freshest local ingredients. Five years later, that promise holds true as the couple grow their own vegetables upstate at Meadowsweet Farm. "We see [Meadowsweet] as an extension of our home," the two said in a statement on their website.
Pig and Khao (Lower East Side)
"Top Chef" contestant Leah Cohen pays tribute to the southeast Asian food she grew up with at Lower East Side hot spot Pig and Khao. Featuring a street-food inspired menu paired with urban art throughout the restaurant, it is easy to see that Cohen favors casual and inviting ambience.
Lido (Harlem)
James Beard Award-winning chef and bestselling author Serena Bass serves upscale, classic Italian food on Harlem's restaurant row at Lido. Bass, who once catered a last-minute 60-person dinner party for Andy Warhol, proudly states that all meat and poultry are sourced from farms that treat animals humanely.
Flex Mussels (locations on 82nd and 13th streets)
"There's nothing more powerful than being recognized by your own industry and peers," said owner Laura Shapiro, who specializes in serving up Prince Edward Island mussels. "The restaurant industry has evolved with more female owners and I'm looking forward to seeing more women step into decisive roles of running businesses and creating equitable, innovative and exciting workplaces. Next stop, we take over the wo

Texto completo: In hindsight, it’s almost shocking that T Bone Burnett has never been a keynote speaker at South by Southwest before this year. A Grammy-winning producer and Oscar-winning songwriter who’s also done considerable work with sound production technology, Burnett is right at the center of where SXSW’s primary avenues of music, film and interactive intersect.
His lone previous appearance at SXSW was in 1992, performing on an Auditorium Shores bill headlined by Willie Nelson. At that time, Burnett was still primarily known as a performing artist, having made about a dozen records under his own name or with 1970s trio the Alpha Band. The ‘90s became his breakout decade as a producer (Counting Crows, Wallflowers, Gillian Welch, etc.) before the 2000s brought a wave of film-soundtrack success starting with the Coen Brothers’ “Oh Brother Where Art Thou?”
Burnett helped to develop a hi-fi audio standard called Code, seeking to improve on MP3 sound, but more recently he’s brought his career full circle with a return to songwriting. His SXSW appearance ties in with “The Invisible Light,” a three-volume collaborative project with drummer Jay Bellerose and producer/composer Keefus Ciancia. The first installment, “Acoustic Space,” is due out April 12 on Verve Forecast.
The subject matter addresses the unfolding of a 21st-century dystopia, Burnett explained by phone last month.
“I’ve always written about self-delusion and self-deception,” he says. “But I’ve gone ahead and widened the circle to a mass deception that’s taking place. As a species, it’s something we need to look at carefully.”
Musically, Burnett describes the project as “trip visualist music” on his website. The combination of trance, electronica, folk, tribal and other sounds is an outgrowth of recent music Burnett has made with Bellerose and Ciancia for the HBO show “True Detective.”
“It’s very much a collaborative process,” Burnett says. “I think of it as a band, really.”
Coming to SXSW was a priority for Burnett because “it was important to me to speak about the things that the record’s speaking about. Perhaps I can put the record in context for people,” he says.
“The dystopia we live in now is so much worse than the worst dystopias of my youth. Orwell feared that the truth would be hidden from us. Huxley feared that the truth would be drowned in a sea of irrelevance. And they were both right. We’ve mechanized this sea of irrelevance, and automated it,” Burnett says.
Burnett will speak at 11 a.m. March 13 at Hilton Downtown Salon H. Other high-profile musical acts speaking at SXSW include:
Adam Horovitz and Michael Diamond. The two surviving members of the Beastie Boys, aka Ad-Rock and and Mike D, will speak with Amazon Music’s Nathan Brackett about their recent New York Times best-seller “Beastie Boys Book,” which covers the groundbreaking rock/rap trio’s legacy and the loss of their bandmate Adam “MCA” Yauch, who died in 2012. (11 a.m. March 15, Convention Center Ballroom D)
Brandi Carlile. The outspoken Seattle singer-songwriter, fresh from winning three Grammys last month, will speak with Emmy-winning actress Elisabeth Moss about Moss’ role as a punk rocker in “Her Smell,” which is showing as part of the SXSW Film Festival. Moss is featured in the recent video for Carlile’s song “Party of One.” (12:30 p.m. March 10, Convention Center Ballroom D)
David Byrne. The legendary Talking Heads frontman, who turned heads with a groundbreaking live show last year that included two performances at the Austin City Limits Music Festival, brings his “Reasons to Be Cheerful” multimedia project to SXSW. From climate change to civic engagement to education to technology to transportation, Byrne addresses ways to create positive change. (12:30 p.m. March 13, Hilton Salon H)
Shirley Manson and Lauren Mayberry. The frontwomen for rock bands Garbage and Chvrches, respectively, will speak about “creativity, the music industry and the female identifying narrative” in a tandem conversation with Pitchfork’s Puja Patel. (11 a.m. March 14, Hilton Salon H)
Nile Rodgers. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame producer and co-founder of funk/disco greats Chi will speak about songwriting with Canadian music industry exec Merck Mercuriadis. (12:30 p.m. March 15, Convention Center Room 18ABC)
Wyclef Jean. The Haitian rapper and singer, who was a co-founder of Grammy winners the Fugees, will speak about the master classes he’s given in recent years at universities around the country and what he learned from students in the process, resulting in a new album titled “Wyclef Goes Back to School.” (2 p.m. March 15, Convention Center Room 18ABC; also performing 1 a.m. March 14 at the Parish)
Lance Bass. The former member of 1990s teen sensations ‘N Sync has gone on to become an accomplished film and television producer. He’ll be back in town in May to host a nostalgia fest at the HEB Center. (12:30 p.m. March 13, Convention Center Room 18ABC)

Texto completo: Ricky Gervais plays a nasty widower in a new Netflix series. And the Tim Roth-led "Tin Star" returns to Amazon.
What's Streaming
AFTER LIFE Stream on Netflix. The premise of this dark comedy series can be summed up in a piece of advice given in its first episode: "I should warn you -- he might say a few things that are a bit, uhh, brutal." That line, spoken by Matt (Tom Basden), the head of the local newspaper in a small British town, is said in reference to Tony (Ricky Gervais), an editor of the paper. The show is about Tony; he's a former nice guy who, after the death of his wife (Kerry Godliman), decides that life would be easier if he started being a jerk to everyone, all the time. It's a bit like a cynical, reversed version of the positive-thinking Jim Carrey comedy "Yes Man," with the smile turned upside-down.
TIN STAR Stream on Amazon. Backcountry brooding is the lifeblood of this series, which stars Tim Roth as a British expat who gets hired as the police chief of a community in the Rocky Mountains. The first season ended in a betrayal that left Roth's character for dead; the second season, which hasn't been available stateside until now, picks up right after that. Expect rough justice.
JUANITA (2018) Stream on Netflix. It's a great American tradition, hitting the road in search of fulfillment. The desire for self-discovery is partly what drives Juanita (Alfre Woodard) to grab a map and pick a destination at random in this earnest solo road trip comedy, which is based on a novel by Sheila Williams (Roderick M. Spencer, Woodard's husband, wrote the screenplay). Juanita is exhausted: by city life, by her three adult kids. So she buys a bus ticket to Montana, kicking off a nomadic trip filled with lighthearted culture clashes and another age-old theme: the balance of romance and autonomy.
ROCK 'N' ROLL HIGH SCHOOL (1979) Stream on Amazon and Hulu; Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. This punk rock time capsule turns 40 this year. Directed by Allan Arkush and starring the members of the Ramones, its plot involves a mass record burning and comically wicked school administrators and hall monitors. Its soundtrack has songs by the Ramones (naturally), Devo and Alice Cooper. "Rock 'n' Roll High School" purports to be little more than summer fun," John Rockwell wrote in his review for The New York Times. "And, in its zanily unpretentious way, it is certainly that."
What's on TV
RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK (1981) 8 p.m. on Paramount Network. Steven Spielberg's continent-hopping, Nazi-melting, swashbuckling archaeological adventure movie started the Indiana Jones franchise. Paramount Network is showing it alongside its prequel, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984), which airs at 10:35 p.m. Spielberg has been in the news this month following reports that he intends to propose rules to limit streaming services' ability to compete for Oscars. But if streaming is your speed, all four Indiana Jones movies are also available on Netflix.

Texto completo: To the Editor:
Re "Rift Over Israel Has Democrats Divided by Age" (front page, March 6):
Of course Democrats are more aggressive in combating prejudice within their own party. It's both human nature and good diplomacy to hold your own family to higher standards than outsiders or adversaries (otherwise, you'd just look partisan and hypocritical).
As an older American Jewish Democrat, I am as aghast as younger American Jews at Israel's inhumane treatment of Palestinians. I encourage speaking out against it and I applaud Jewish-Palestinian collaboration. But anti-Semitic tropes about the power of Jewish money and the dual allegiance of American Jews are inexcusable aspersions in the face of what might otherwise be valid concerns.
Jewish Democrats are fairly defending themselves against such tropes; if other groups -- people of color, Muslims, Palestinians -- criticize Jewish Democrats for not speaking up more forcefully on their behalf as well, that is fair, too. But why aren't those other groups equally concerned about anti-Semitism?
James Berkman
Boston
To the Editor:
"Concerns Raised Over Power Wielded by a Pro-Israel Lobbying Giant" (news article, March 5) provides useful information about the tactics the pro-Israel lobby uses to pressure and intimidate members of Congress. Until now, these methods have largely accomplished their goal: an almost total and unconditional refusal in Congress to question Israel's human rights violations against Palestinians or the $3.8 billion in military aid we give to Israel each year.
When Representative Ilhan Omar, one of only two Muslim congresswomen, dares to question this, she is pilloried and falsely accused of anti-Semitism. This is a disgrace.
I am one of thousands of American Jews who applaud Ms. Omar for her courage and honesty and stand with her in objecting to Israel's brutal and worsening policies toward Palestinians.
Ms. Omar speaks simple truth. Isn't unconditional support of another country no matter its actions a form of allegiance to that country?
Rosalind Petchesky
New York
The writer is professor emerita of political science at Hunter College and the Graduate Center, CUNY.
To the Editor:
Oh my, oh my! As a longtime resident of Minnesota's Fifth Congressional District, and as someone who voted for Ilhan Omar, I now have some advice for her:
"Sit down, keep quiet for a while and learn your job. I don't want to see your picture or any article about you in The New York Times again until the news is about something substantive like ... umm ... legislation. That's why you were elected."
Judith Koll Healey
Minneapolis
To the Editor:
I am deeply shaken by the fault lines that have been exposed by the recent controversy around the influence wielded by the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, or Aipac. It is not anti-Semitic to hold Israel to the same standards as we do other nations. Many Jewish people, myself included, disagree with the current policies of the Israeli government, particularly with regard to the human rights of the Palestinian people, the occupied territories and the settlements.
Identity politics perpetuate stereotypes and prejudice and ultimately dehumanize us. We need to take a breath and have honest, good-faith discussions without throwing around accusations of anti-Semitism when we disagree.
J. Sarah Posner
York, Pa.
To the Editor:
Unless we Democrats stop squabbling over Israel and "the Benjamins" and proposing unaffordable "socialist" schemes, we will have another four years of a deeply conservative and erratic Trump administration. Democrats should instead concentrate on passing sensible legislation on issues that polls already show have the support of a majority of Americans. Don't pontificate. Legislate!
Peter Frost
Williamstown, Mass.
To the Editor:
I continue to applaud the election of two Muslim women to Congress, even though their presence and remarks have exacerbated tensions over Israel and anti-Semitism. They present us with a marvelous opportunity.
As a rabbi on Long Island for many decades, I was very proud of my congregation's establishment of an ongoing dialogue with a nearby mosque. The friendship that emerged enabled us to discuss many inflammatory subjects including Palestinian/Israeli crises, growing Islamophobia and the complicated distinction between criticism of Israel and anti-Semitism, which lies at the heart of the current controversy.
Now is the time for synagogue and mosque leaders to reach out to each other, building trust and understanding. The Democrats can resolve their rift with patience and tolerance. American Jews and Muslims, natural allies facing a resurgence of racial and religious hatred, can do so, too.

For Democrats to win, they must avoid leftist mythmaking

Texto completo: At 29, with her Puerto Rican heritage, megawatt smile and 3 million-plus Twitter followers, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez embodies the rising power of younger female nonwhite digital natives in American politics. If Hillary Rodham Clinton, or HRC, reflects the past, AOC foreshadows the future.
But as a role model for Democrats who desperately want to defeat Donald Trump, AOC is not A-OK. She represents New York City, one of the most liberal cities in the country, and as a self-proclaimed democratic socialist, her radical views on issues like "Medicare-for-all" and a "Green New Deal" fall far outside her party’s mainstream — let alone the national consensus. In the latest NBC/Wall Street Journal poll, only 18 percent viewed the term "socialist" favorably.
"There is, without a doubt, a myth that Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez somehow represents the narrative of Democratic primary voters in the country," Democratic pollster John Anzalone told The Washington Post. "Almost half of them identify themselves as moderates or conservatives."
Moreover, she reflects an intolerant impulse among Democratic leftists to purge the party of moderate heretics. After 26 of her fellow House members voted with Republicans to make it harder for undocumented immigrants to purchase guns, AOC threatened to put them "on a list" for primary challenges.
"Since when is it OK to put you on a Nixonian list?" Rep. Josh Gottheimer of New Jersey, co-chair of the centrist Problem Solvers Caucus, protested in the Post. "We need to have a big tent in our party, or we won’t keep the House or win the White House."
The myth Anzalone identifies has bedeviled the Democratic Party since the death of Franklin Roosevelt 74 years ago. Liberals do form a critical component of the party’s "big tent" coalition, and no Democratic nominee can win the White House without their support. That’s why the far-too-late and far-too-grudging endorsement of Clinton by Bernie Sanders (or BS) was so damaging.
That said, Democrats cannot capture the presidency or either branch of Congress by lurching leftward. A candidate in the AOC/BS mold would be a hero in New York, California and Massachusetts — and a disaster in states like Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, which handed Trump the presidency in 2016 and will be critical again next year.
Ed Rendell, the former governor of Pennsylvania, stressed this point to The New York Times: "The more we have presidential candidates or newly elected congresspeople talking about the Green New Deal, talking about ‘Medicare-for-all,’ talking about socialism, the more that plays into the Trump campaign’s hands."
Christopher Borick, a political scientist at Muhlenberg College in Allentown, Pennsylvania, added: "If you want to lock up Pennsylvania for a Democrat, the more moderate Democrats are the key."
The numbers support them. A Gallup poll in January reported that 35 percent of Americans call themselves conservatives, the same number that identify as moderates. Only 26 percent are self-described liberals, the same portion who chose that label in 2016 exit polls.
It’s true that within the Democrats’ ranks, the percentage of liberals is rising, hitting 51 percent this year according to Gallup. But pragmatists still dominate the party. Fifty-four percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents want the party to "move closer to the center" while 41 percent "would rather it shift further left."
The same tension between purists and pragmatists is playing out in the House, where the AOC types are calling for the rapid impeachment of the president. But Democratic leaders are taking a much slower approach, with Rep. Jerrold Nadler, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, insisting that impeachment must meet a "very high bar."
No president has ever been removed through impeachment (although Richard Nixon probably would have been the first, had he not resigned). The bar is and should be "very high."
But denying a president a second term through the ballot box is quite common, and in fact happened three times in five elections between 1976 and 1992. That bar is much lower and well within the reach of Democrats if they can avoid the mythmaking of leftists like AOC and BS and focus on political reality.

Will 'Us,' Jordan Peele's first film since 'Get Out,' be sophomore slump — or jump?

Texto completo: Jordan Peele's second writer-director outing, “Us," opens March 22. Lupita Nyong'o plays a woman, Adelaide Wilson, who takes a seaside vacation with her family. Things get complicated when four people break into their house. Things get even more complicated because the four people look just like the Wilsons.
“Us" is a big deal. What makes it a big deal is that Peele's debut was “Get Out." Considering the plot, maybe “Us" should be called “Get In."
It's hard to believe now, but before “Get Out" opened it wasn't a big deal. Half of the comedy team of Key & Peele has written and directed a . . . horror movie? OK, fine.
Well, very fine, actually. “Get Out" was that rare triple play: a critically acclaimed box-office hit that turned into a cultural event. People didn't just watch “Get Out" and like it. People watched it and liked it and talked about it. It also won Peele a screenwriting Oscar.
You could argue that “Get Out" was a quadruple play, since it was a directing debut by an actor. Peele follows in a long line of stars who have stepped behind the camera. Sometimes the results have been impressive — or more than impressive (two words: “Citizen" and “Kane"). Sometimes they've been glorified ego trips (too many examples to list).
There have been performers whose directing careers came to equal or even surpass their careers in front of the camera: Orson Welles, John Cassavetes, Woody Allen, Jerry Lewis, Clint Eastwood, Penny Marshall. Will Peele join that group or remain primarily known as a performer? A more interesting question: Will “Us" be an example of sophomore slump or sophomore jump? Although the former is more common, the latter has been known to happen.
Here are five contemporary actors who've tried directing — and a look at how their first and second films comparatively fared.
BARBRA STREISAND
Yentl (1983)
Director, co-writer
Box office ranking for 1983: 18
Oscar nominations: 5
Wins:1, best music
Critical response: good but not overwhelming. Pauline Kael and Roger Ebert both liked it a lot. Isaac Bashevis Singer, author of the short story on which “Yentl" is based, did not. He found “artistic merit in neither the adaptation, nor in the directing."
The Prince of Tides (1991)
Director
Box office ranking for 1991: 16
Oscar nominations: 7, includingbest picture
Wins: none
Critical reception: very good. Even better, Pat Conroy, author of the novel on which the film is based, inscribed a copy “To Barbra Streisand: The Queen of Tides."
Slump or jump: jump
KEVIN COSTNER
Dances With Wolves (1990)
Director
Box office ranking for 1990: 3
Oscar nominations: 12, including picture and best director
Wins: 7, including best picture and best director
Critical reception: very good, though “Goodfellas" should have won the best picture Oscar, and Kael wrote, “Kevin Costner has feathers in his hair and feathers in his head. The Indians should have called him 'Plays With Camera.' "
The Postman (1997)
Director
Box office ranking for 1997: 93
Oscar nominations: none
Wins: none
Critical reception: Don't ask.
Slump or jump: Slump is too weak a word.
MEL GIBSON
The Man Without a Face (1993)
Director
Box office ranking for 1993: 62
Oscar nominations: none
Wins: none
Critical reception: unenthusiastically respectful. In Newsweek, David Ansen called it “such a noble, well-intentioned little film — a cross between 'Dead Poets Society' and 'The Phantom of the Opera!' done as an after-school special — that one feels like an ogre picking on it."
Braveheart (1995)
Director
Box office ranking for 1995: 18
Oscar nominations: 10, including best picture and best director
Wins: 5, including best picture and best director
Critical reception: mostly very good. The New York Times review called it “one of the most spectacular entertainments in years."
Slump or jump: Jump is too weak a word.
GEORGE CLOONEY
Confessions of a Dangerous Mind (2002)
Director
Box office ranking for 2002: 120
Oscar nominations: none
Wins: none
Critical reception: mostly positive
Good Night, and Good Luck (2005)
Director, co-writer
Box office ranking for 2005: 89
Oscar nominations: 6, including best picture, best director, and best original screenplay
Wins: none
Critical reception: very positive
Slump or jump: jump
BEN AFFLECK
Director, co-writer
Gone Baby Gone (2007)
Box office ranking for 2007: 108
Oscar nominations: 1, best supporting actress (Amy Ryan)
Wins: none
Critical reception: very positive
The Town (2010)
Director, co-writer
Box office ranking for 2010: 36
Oscar nominations:1, best supporting actor (Jeremy Renner)
Wins: none
Critical response: positive
Slump or jump: slight slump, with a big jump coming with Affleck's next movie, “Argo" (2012)

Texto completo: Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg unveiled a major strategy shift on Wednesday, declaring that the world's largest social network will develop a highly secure private communications platform based on the company's popular Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp services.
The new platform will complement the original Facebook service, an open forum where over 2 billion people exchange news and information, but also marks a significant pivot for the company and the social media industry.
The billions of dollars spent annually by advertisers to reach Facebook users have made Zuckerberg one of the world's wealthiest men. But users are growing increasingly uneasy with the underlying premise of the company's business model: tracking their personal data and selling it to advertisers and others.
On Wednesday, Zuckerberg said consumers are now demanding a more private, more personal online experience.
“I believe the future of communication will increasingly shift to private, encrypted services where people can be confident what they say to each other stays secure and their messages and content won't stick around forever," Zuckerberg wrote in a blog post. “This is the future I hope we will help bring about."
The move follows a brutal series of crises at Facebook. The company has been implicated in efforts by the Russian government to tamper with the 2016 US presidential election. Personal information on about 50 million users was illicitly obtained by Cambridge Analytica, a political consulting firm with ties to Donald Trump's presidential campaign. Data on millions of other Facebook users was stolen by hackers, and Facebook was used to spread hateful and misleading messages that may have inspired murderous violence in the nations of Myanmar and India.
The scandals have hammered Facebook's reputation. Roger McNamee, an early investor in Facebook and author of “Zucked," a highly critical book about the company, said that Zuckerberg's announcement is partly intended to break the cycle of bad news. “Their brand is getting crushed," said McNamee. “They need a PR win."
David O'Brien, assistant director of research at Harvard University's Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society, compared Zuckerberg's statement to the 2002 “Trustworthy Computing" memo issued by Microsoft Corp.'s cofounder Bill Gates. Back then, Microsoft had developed a terrible reputation for building insecure, easily hacked software. The top-to-bottom transformation of the company's security practices announced by Gates helped rescue its image.
“This is the Trustworthy Computing moment all over again," said O'Brien.
Zuckerberg said that all the messaging services would use end-to-end encryption to ensure that nobody — not even Facebook — could view the contents except senders and recipients. This would make it impossible for Facebook to use the information for marketing purposes, raising questions about how the company will profit from the service.
In addition, Facebook will redesign Messenger, Whats­App, and Instagram so that they will seamlessly communicate with one another, instead of operating as separate, incompatible services. This part of the plan was previously announced in January. Critics of the company said that it was intended to fend off a possible demand by US antitrust regulators that Facebook divest one or more of its messaging services. If the three messaging networks are tightly connected, such a divestiture could become almost impossible.
But Michael Cusumano, a professor at the MIT Sloan School of Management, thinks app integration is also paving the way for Facebook to become a financial powerhouse. The New York Times has reported that the company is looking to establish its own cryptocurrency, a potential rival to bitcoin. Cusumano said that this could enable Facebook to become an international currency exchange system, enabling users to instantly shift money anywhere in the world through the merged instant messaging network. Facebook could profit either by charging fees or by earning interest on money deposited by users.
If it works, Facebook would make a fortune off the messaging system, even without advertising revenues, Cusumano said.
The new network would also embrace the concept of self-destructing messages first popularized by Snapchat. A user could order the software to wipe any message after a month or a year. Or it could be programmed to archive old messages indefinitely.
Snapchat's parent company, whose stock was already trading about 40 percent below its March 2017 initial public offering price, fell 2 percent on Wednesday. Facebook rose less than 1 percent.
Zuckerberg also promised that Facebook would only store its users' information in countries that respect human rights, especially privacy. “Upholding this principle may mean that our services will get blocked in some countries, or that we won't be able to enter others anytime soon," Zuckerberg said. “That's a trade-off we're willing to make."
By contrast, Apple has agreed to store information about its Chinese customers in China, raising the possibility that the Chinese government might force the company to hand over information about political dissidents.
It's unclear whether the proposals will lead to changes at the original Facebook service. The company has said it will soon enable Facebook users to delete their entire usage history. But it's unknown whether they'll be given the option to delete data selectively — for instance, by wiping out their comments and posts after a year has passed.
Longtime Facebook watchers reacted to the news with a mixture of praise and skepticism. “Privacy safeguards for Facebook users are long overdue," said Marc Rotenberg, executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. “Nonetheless, Facebook dominates the Internet messaging market. To ensure competition and innovation, there should be other companies, and Facebook should be required to divest WhatsApp."
McNamee said that better private messaging does little to change the fact that Facebook uses a variety of other methods to monitor the behavior of billions of Internet users.
“They track people everywhere," said McNamee. “So until they stop tracking people everywhere, they're going to remain a huge challenge for consumers."

Texto completo: Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., suffers either from memory loss or she’s a bad liar. Or both!

The 2020 Democratic presidential candidate was asked this week during an interview on CBS's "This Morning" to address the perception that she has flip-flopped on key issues, especially when it’s politically convenient.

"It's still the talk of dinner party conversations about Sen. Gillibrand that she flips and flops, that she betrayed the Clintons, that she seems to go with whatever the wind is blowing," said CBS’ Gayle King. "I know you've heard that. How do you feel about that, and how do you address it?"

Gillibrand responded, saying, "It's certainly not my record, not who I am. It's true that my first election was a 2-1 Republican district in upstate New York. I was able to run that campaign on getting out of Iraq and [on] ‘Medicare for all', but still won a 2-1 Republican district. And won re-election by a 24-point margin.”

This one is simple enough. Let’s review her record.

When Gillibrand served in the House of Representatives between 2007 and 2009, she was rightly considered a moderate — a so-called Blue Dog Democrat. She was proudly conservative on several key issues, including immigration and gun control. The Daily Beast actually characterized her in 2008 as a “bizarro version of Sarah Palin."

But then Gillibrand set her sights on the U.S. Senate seat vacated by Hillary Clinton. Working closely with her political patrons, who also happened to be the Clintons, Gillibrand was elected senator and moved up in the party’s ranks. Since that time, Gillibrand’s career in Congress’ upper chamber has been one long series of flip-flops, one after the other.
Just look at how she had changed on the issue of Second Amendment rights.

As a congresswoman, Gillibrand received an “A” rating from the National Rifle Association. She touted this well-earned distinction regularly, much to the chagrin of the Democratic Party’s more liberal elements. The New York Times’ Maureen Dowd, for example, called Gillibrand “an N.R.A. handmaiden in Bobby Kennedy’s old seat.”

Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, a major anti-gun crusader, even said of Gillibrand in 2009 that he had a “strong disagreement with one area of her record as a member of Congress: illegal guns.”

He added, “She has actively opposed the efforts of New York City, and cities around the state and nation, to enact commonsense measures to keep illegal guns out of the hands of criminals.”

But then Gillibrand won her Senate race and it wasn't long before she discovered a sudden appreciation for her party's efforts to enact stricter gun control measures. And the newly minted senator didn’t leave it at just signaling her support -- she soon took active steps to fight against the House version of herself.

“Gillibrand came out and opposed one of the very bills she had cosponsored in the House” on the Second Amendment, National Journal reported in 2013.

Later, in 2017, when Gillibrand was confronted in an interview regarding her gun control flip-flop, she defended herself by saying, “I didn’t actually take the time to understand the issue as well as I should have … I should have been a lot smarter and a lot more sensitive.” Gillibrand grew bolder in her defenses, saying that same year she “never changed” her “values.”

It’s awfully hard to reconcile how Gillibrand went from bragging about “keeping shotguns under her bed” when she was a congresswoman to calling for a “women’s crusade” for stricter gun control laws.

Then there’s immigration. In the years before going to the Senate, Gillibrand explicitly opposed giving “amnesty to illegal aliens.” In fact, as CBS News’ Sharyn Alfonsi noted last year, Rep. Gillibrand’s position on immigration was closer to President Trump's than anything else.

But then Gillibrand became a senator, and her positions changed almost immediately. Almost too quickly, as Muzaffar Chishti of the Migration Policy Institute suggested in 2013 when she said she was “extremely intrigued by how quickly she [Gillibrand] changed her stance.”

The senator has now called for ICE to be abolished. She has also said that ICE shouldn't be abolished, arguing instead that it should merely be given a makeover.

Gillibrand claimed in December 2017 that she hasn't flip-flopped on immigration, arguing that she merely discovered that she was “limited” in her views.

“I didn’t know enough,” she said of her newfound appreciation for the party’s ultra-permissive pro-immigration platform. “It was a huge flaw I had to fix.”

I'm sure her going to the Senate is just a coincidence.

Then there’s Gillibrand's current position on LGBT rights, which is basically the exact opposite of where she was as a congresswoman, back when she received the lowest rating of any New York Democrat from the pro-LGBT Human Rights Campaign. In 2009, after coming to the Senate, Gillibrand endorsed the legalization of same-sex marriage in the Empire State. Interestingly enough, she specifically declined to endorse this when she served the state’s 20th Congressional District.

It’s amazing what politics can do to a person's supposedly firm beliefs.

The New York Times is trying hard to clean up after AOC's Green New Deal mess

Texto completo: It’s one thing for a newsroom to bend over backward and puff up a member of Congress. It’s another thing entirely to help that lawmaker push a lie.

The New York Times did exactly that when it published a servile bit of spin this week in service of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s, D-N.Y, absurd Green New Deal.

The article, titled “Pressed by Climate Activists, Senate Democrats Plan to ‘Go on Offense,'" is mostly unremarkable. It’s the exact sort of thing you’d expect from a news organization that’s more likely than not to be sympathetic toward Democrats’ $93 trillion-dollar plan to remake the U.S. economy.

But there’s one section in the Times report that is particularly egregious. It reads:

"The Green New Deal immediately won the embrace of multiple Democratic presidential candidates, including Senators Kamala Harris of California, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, Cory Booker of New Jersey, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, and Bernie Sanders, independent of Vermont.
But it was also hit by a backlash, as Ms. Ocasio-Cortez’s website mistakenly published a draft summary of the document that included contentious provisions not endorsed by those candidates, like language that called for economic security “for all who are unable or unwilling to work.”
The authors of this passage are either ignorant or dishonest. Ocasio-Cortez and her allies badly botched the rollout of her Green New Deal proposal by publishing a laughably silly “frequently asked questions” page that included nonsense about “farting cows” and providing “economic security for all who are unable or unwilling to work.” Her office provided newsrooms with copies of this FAQ. It was not an error . The FAQ represented her premeditated position on the issue. She's not the deep thinker they want her to be.

Rather own up to authoring and circulating something that dumb, the congresswoman and her staff instead lied about the “FAQ,” pushing some absurd narrative instead alleging they were the victims of a right-wing disinformation campaign. Ocasio-Cortez teams admitted eventually to authoring the “FAQ,” but only after she had muddied the waters with some bogus claim about how someone else had created doctored versions of her bill.

As if that weren't bad enough, newsrooms like the New York Times are actually helping Ocasio-Cortez to push the lie that her office didn’t mean to author and distribute the ludicrous “FAQ.” What’s so maddening about the Times simply accepting the congresswoman’s version of events is that it involves ignoring that her staff gave newsrooms the now-infamous "cow farts" reading materials.

National Public Radio was the first news outlet to report extensively on the contents of Green New Deal proposal. In its exclusive report, titled “Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Releases Green New Deal Outline,” there’s a passage that reads:
In addition, the framework, as described in the legislation as well as a blog post — containing an updated version of 'FAQs' provided to NPR by Ocasio-Cortez's office — calls for a variety of other lofty goals ...
The link included in the above passage leads readers back to the “FAQ” the Times claims was “mistakenly” published. Don’t you just hate it when you mistakenly publish things on your own website and hand out documents to newsrooms?

An incurious press is a terrible thing. When it comes to the press being incurious, nothing encourages that more than uncomfortable questions about Democratic lawmakers.

“La (corrompida) Hillary Clinton confirma que no se postulará en 2020, descarta una tercera candidatura para la Casa Blanca” , escribió el mandatario “¡Maldición! ¿Eso significa que no volveré a competir contra ella? ¡Ella será muy extrañada!” .
“(Crooked) Hillary Clinton confirms she will not run in 2020, rules out a third bid for White House.” Aw-shucks, does that mean I won’t get to run against her again? She will be sorely missed!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 5, 2019
Sin embargo, menos de 24 horas después de que Clinton apareciera ante la cámara de News12 Westchester y descartara postularse para la presidencia en 2020, fuentes afirman que la demócrata estaba sorprendida de que su anuncio ¡se tomara en serio!
“No estoy compitiendo” , dijo.
Aunque fuentes del New York Times afirman que afirman que ella sigue analizando participar en la contienda electoral, en espera de los resultados de la investigación de Robert Mueller sobre la intervención de Rusia en las elecciones de 2016.
Según la periodista del Times, Maggie Haberman , una persona cercana a Clinton le confirmó esa información.
“Hablé con alguien cercano a Clinton que estuvo en contacto con ella hoy. Dice que ella no estaba tratando de ser enfática al cerrar la puerta sobre competir cuando se dirigió a un periodista local ayer, y que se sorprendió de cómo fue tratado el tema”, escribió Haberman. “La persona también dice que es extremadamente improbable que compita, pero que le molesta que se espere que cierre la puerta cuando, digamos, John Kerry no lo está. Ella le ha dicho a su equipo que está esperando al menos ver el informe de Mueller”.
The person also says she is extremely unlikely to run, but that she remains bothered that she’s expected to close the door on it when, say, John Kerry isn’t. She has told her team she is waiting at least to see the Mueller report. 2/2

Clinton perdió las elecciones presidenciales de 2016 ante Trump y dijo que planeaba tomar un papel activo en el Partido Demócrata ante la próxima elección.

Texto completo: El presidente Donald Trump se burló de Hillary Clinton , después de que ésta afirmara en una entrevista que no competiría por la presidencia en 2020.
“La (corrompida) Hillary Clinton confirma que no se postulará en 2020, descarta una tercera candidatura para la Casa Blanca” , escribió el mandatario “¡Maldición! ¿Eso significa que no volveré a competir contra ella? ¡Ella será muy extrañada!” .
“(Crooked) Hillary Clinton confirms she will not run in 2020, rules out a third bid for White House.” Aw-shucks, does that mean I won’t get to run against her again? She will be sorely missed!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 5, 2019
Sin embargo, menos de 24 horas después de que Clinton apareciera ante la cámara de News12 Westchester y descartara postularse para la presidencia en 2020, fuentes afirman que la demócrata estaba sorprendida de que su anuncio ¡se tomara en serio!
“No estoy compitiendo” , dijo.
Aunque fuentes del New York Times afirman que afirman que ella sigue analizando participar en la contienda electoral, en espera de los resultados de la investigación de Robert Mueller sobre la intervención de Rusia en las elecciones de 2016.
Según la periodista del Times, Maggie Haberman , una persona cercana a Clinton le confirmó esa información.
“Hablé con alguien cercano a Clinton que estuvo en contacto con ella hoy. Dice que ella no estaba tratando de ser enfática al cerrar la puerta sobre competir cuando se dirigió a un periodista local ayer, y que se sorprendió de cómo fue tratado el tema”, escribió Haberman. “La persona también dice que es extremadamente improbable que compita, pero que le molesta que se espere que cierre la puerta cuando, digamos, John Kerry no lo está. Ella le ha dicho a su equipo que está esperando al menos ver el informe de Mueller”.
The person also says she is extremely unlikely to run, but that she remains bothered that she’s expected to close the door on it when, say, John Kerry isn’t. She has told her team she is waiting at least to see the Mueller report. 2/2
— Maggie Haberman (@maggieNYT) March 6, 2019
Clinton perdió las elecciones presidenciales de 2016 ante Trump y dijo que planeaba tomar un papel activo en el Partido Demócrata ante la próxima elección.
Se reportó que la exsecretaria de Estado ya se reunió con algunos de los aspirantes a candidato del 2020 y ofreció consejos para no dar “nada por sentado” ante el actual mandatario.

Guthrie season covers the map

Texto completo: From its perch on the Mississippi River, the Guthrie Theater will travel all over the map in its just-announced 2019-20 season.
There's a Southern flair to "Steel Magnolias" (Oct. 26-Dec. 15), the comedy set in a Louisiana hair salon that offers juicy roles for six female actors, and "The Glass Menagerie" (Sept. 14-Oct. 26), which comes from the Mississippi-born imagination (and autobiography) of one of the great dramatists, Tennessee Williams. With its tale of a protective woman and her two adult children, "Menagerie" will open the season with a new production directed by Guthrie Artistic Director Joseph Haj.
Haj returns to helm "Cabaret" (June 20-Aug. 23, 2020), set in 1930s Berlin. The show that brought us "Willkommen" and "Money, Money, Money" continues the Guthrie tradition of a classic summer musical. Haj, who directed it in 2013 at his previous artistic home, North Carolina's PlayMakers Rep, thinks the show's exploration of race, gender, sex and politics is especially apt for an election year.
"It seems impossible," Haj said, "but com
ing out of the ashes of World War I and before the catastrophe of World War II, you have this incredibly fertile period, artistically." Haj said he pushed hard for a chance to "reinvest" in the musical with a new group of collaborators.
Legendary theatermaker Anne Bogart will bring her gender-fluid adaptation of Euripides' "The Bacchae" (Feb. 29-April 5, 2020) to the Twin Cities. The revenge drama played in New York last year in a production the New York Times called "broadly entertaining."
Some Guthrie soothsayers predicted a 2019-20 production of recent Broadway hit "A Doll's House, Part 2," but the theater will present a different contemporary take on Henrik Ibsen's feminist drama. It'll be Heather Raffo's New York-set "Noura" (Jan. 11-Feb. 16, 2020), in which the Iraqi-American title character must weigh her own dreams against society's expectations.
Karen Zacarias' "Native Gardens" was a summer hit in 2017 on the theater's proscenium stage. The playwright returns there next year for "Destiny of Desire" (May 30-July 11, 2020), a live version of Mexico's popular telenovela soap operas, complete with babies who are switched at birth and improbable musical numbers.
Various shows came in and fell out during season planning, Haj noted. (Versions of the 2019-20 season were budgeted 34 times, Haj said. Which seems like a lot until you learn that's six times fewer than the previous season.) But "Destiny of Desire," a coproduction with Cincinnati Playhouse in the Park and Milwaukee Repertory Theater, was there from the beginning.
Another Guthrie favorite making a return visit is Lynn Nottage, with her Pulitzer Prize-winning "Sweat" (July 25-Aug. 29, 2020). The Pittsburgh-set drama about economic uncertainty in the town of Reading, Pa., is a companion piece to Nottage's "Floyd's," which will get its world premiere at the Guthrie this summer (the theater also produced Nottage's "Intimate Apparel" in 2005).
A pair of shows take audiences to 19th-century England: the holiday return of "A Christmas Carol" (Nov. 12-Dec. 29), again directed by Lauren Keating, and "Emma" (April 11-May 31, 2020), which brings Jane Austen's beloved romcom to the Guthrie, by a playwright who's still being selected. The theater previously staged takes on Austen's "Sense and Sensibility" and "Pride and Prejudice."
The current production of William Shakespeare's "As You Like It" dog whistles to next year's Shakespeare. When the "As You Like It" characters wander through a magical forest, they pass a sign pointing to Illyria, the setting for "Twelfth Night" (Feb. 8-March 22, 2020). Like "As You Like It," a comedy that involves gender fluidity and romantic confusion, "Twelfth Night" also includes twins, suggesting a hitherto unexplored connection between Shakespeare and telenovelas.
Season subscriptions go on sale in May, with individual tickets available later via 612-225-6238 or guthrie theater.org. "A Christmas Carol" will be available as a package add-on.

Ilhan Omar's comments were anti-Semitic rhetoric, let's not beat around the bush: Today's talker

Texto completo: House Democratic leaders plan to call for a vote on a resolution in response to remarks that freshman Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn. , made about Israel.
Omar's comments are wrong. Plain and simple.
By Jonathan Greenblatt
The controversy surrounding the recent comments of Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn. , implying that Jewish Americans have an allegiance to a foreign government — Israel — has ignited a debate in the House of Representatives over whether the freshman congresswoman's remarks were anti-Semitic, and what should be done about them.
At a public forum last week, Omar said, in the context of the U. S. -Israel relationship: "I want to talk about the political influence in this country that says it is OK for people to push for allegiance to a foreign country. "
This weekend, Omar, in response to a tweet from House Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Nita Lowey, wrote: "I should not be expected to have allegiance/pledge support to a foreign country in order to serve my country in Congress or serve on committee. "
Talker: Democrats, try to impeach at your own peril
Ask your friends and family to sign-up for the Today's Talker newsletter
Let's be clear: The problem isn't that Omar criticized Israeli policies. The problem is her comments were anti-Semitic. Accusing Jews of having allegiance to a foreign government has long been a vile anti-Semitic slur used to harass, marginalize and persecute the Jewish people for centuries.
Trying to make this situation about Israel is a tactic to deflect from the central issue of anti-Semitism. It is a move we have seen, for instance, repeatedly in Europe and other countries. It is wrong, plain and simple.
As a result of her comments, the House is expected to introduce a resolution this week rejecting Omar's comments, anti-Semitism, Islamophobia, hatred of immigrants, misogyny and racism.
There is no doubt that all of these issues are scourges that continue to plague our society. At the Anti-Defamation League, we have fiercely opposed hate and bigotry in all forms for more than 100 years. Just last week, when Omar was linked by legislators in West Virginia to the 9/11 attacks, we came out strongly against that vile attack. We unequivocally oppose targeting her, or anyone in the Muslim community, on the basis of faith.
However, at the end of the day, words matter. When prominent people or members of Congress spout anti-Semitic rhetoric, it gives a green light to others to repeat that rhetoric.
We will continue to call out elected officials in both parties when they spew hate, and now is the time for Congress to send a clear, unambiguous message: There is no place for anti-Semitism in the United States.
Jonathan Greenblatt is CEO and national director of the Anti-Defamation League. You can follow him on Twitter: @JGreenblattADL.
What others are saying
Steven Strauss, USA TODAY: "Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn. , has been subjected to many vile racist attacks, but that doesn't excuse her thoughtless remarks. If she and her supporters want to have a serious conversation about changing U. S. policy towards Israel, they’ll find many people in and outside the Jewish community who want to have that discussion. But if they just want to make vaguely worded comments about how 'some people' control the media, buy politicians and have divided loyalties — maybe they're just anti-Semites. "
Henry Olsen, The Washington Post: "The issue is her repeated suggestion that support for the current policy toward Israel is the product of Jewish money buying support and/or Jews who are more loyal to Israel's interests than they are to those of the United States. Those claims are false and bigoted. Republicans learned the hard way with Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, that where there’s smoke, there's fire. "
Thomas L. Friedman, The New York Times: "If she thinks the only reason that Americans support Israel is because of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee and campaign contributions, she is dead wrong. Americans’ affinity with Israel is rooted in a respect for Israel’s ability to maintain a democracy, albeit with flaws, in a sea of autocratic regimes; it is rooted in a Judeo-Christian religious affinity; and it is rooted in respect for Israel’s contributions to technology, medicine and science. AIPAC is the beneficiary of that support, not the cause of it. "
What our readers are saying
How about the House of Representatives call for the removal of Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn. , instead of a resolution on her comments? Obviously, Omar doesn’t care what anyone thinks about what she says about Israel.
— Joe Miller
Why haven’t Democratic leaders introduced legislation to condemn white supremacists yet, then?
— Nicole Keys
Omar said, "I should not be expected to have allegiance/pledge support to a foreign country in order to serve my country in Congress. " Whether you are pro-Israel or not, you must admit she is right. There is no reason to embrace allegiance to another country!
— Yolanda Sorrentino
Questioning legislative and financial favoritism toward a foreign country — regardless of which one — is what I expect a congress member to do.
— David Mathers

N. KOREA HACKERS TARGET 'CRITICAL' INFRASTRUCTURE, SAYS SECURITY FIRM

Texto completo: A group of North Korean hackers is believed to be actively targeting U.S. businesses and "critical infrastructure," a report released this week by cybersecurity firm McAfee said.
McAfee said it found that the North Korean hackers have tried to infiltrate nearly 80 business in critical sectors like finance, telecommunications, energy and defense around the world. Governments themselves were also targeted, McAfee said.
The hacking is believed to have continued during President Donald Trump's summit with Kim Jong Un. The largest number of recent attacks primarily target Germany, Turkey and the United Kingdom as well as the United States, McAfee said.
Pyongyang is believed to operate some of the most sophisticated hacking cells in the world, though the North Korean government has long denied any wrongdoing.
McAfee said it partnered with a "government entity" in its investigation, though it declined to reveal which government it worked with.
The company said the hacking operation shared "numerous technical links" to the Lazarus Group, North Korean hackers believed to have been behind bank heists around the world.
"McAfee believes that such digital forensic evidence must be complemented by traditional evidence from law enforcement and government agencies to make such assertions," Raj Samani, McAfee's chief scientist, told CNN.
"That said, McAfee is obligated to report technical similarities between attacks and campaigns to provide its customers cyber threat intelligence they can use to protect themselves from current and future attacks."
The North Koreans have quickly become a major cyber threat in recent years. In 2014, apparently in retaliation for a movie that mocked Mr. Kim, North Korean hackers hit Sony Pictures Entertainment. They destroyed Sony's computer servers, paralyzed the studio's operations and eventually leaked embarrassing emails from executives, in what would become a playbook for the Russian attacks and leaks of emails ahead of the 2016 elections.
But unlike other countries, which focus more on intelligence operations, the North Koreans tend to focus their energy on cash, said John Demers, the assistant attorney general for national security at the Justice Department.
"Straight up cyber bank theft -that's a significant piece of what they do in cyberspace," Mr. Demers said in an interview with CNN.
U.S. officials said last week that Washington believes the North Korean government has stepped up cyberattacks targeting financial institutions in a desperate bid to acquire cash, as international sanctions levied against Pyongyang have squeezed its economy.
Mr. Kim and Mr. Trump's meeting in Hanoi ended abruptly without a deal, as the two sides could not agree to a detailed plan exchanging sanctions relief for North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons.
Mr. Trump said in a news conference after the meeting that North Korea insisted that Washington lift all sanctions. North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho disputed that assessment in a early morning impromptu press conference just hours after Mr. Trump spoke. He said that Pyongyang only asked the Trump administration to remove the sanctions "that hamper the economy and the livelihood of our people."
Mr. Demers, the Justice Department official, said much of the hacking is motivated by North Korea's desire for cash.
"They just need money," Mr. Demers said. "They need hard currency. That's a good way to get it."

Texto completo: It might be possible, after all.
A second patient now appears to be free of HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, accoMuri Assunording to reports. The "London patient," as he's been referred to by scientists, received a bone-marrow stem cell transplant to treat cancer, and has remained virus-free for more than one year after he stopped taking antiretroviral drugs, the medication taken to prevent the growth of the virus.
Although some researchers believe it might be premature to say the patient has been cured, the breakthrough announcement has renewed hopes that an end to AIDS might be possible, if challenging.
"This will inspire people that cure is not a dream," Dr. Annemarie Wensing, a virologist at the University Medical Center Utrecht in the Netherlands told The New York Times.
Over a decade ago, a German doctor announced the first case of a patient who had been cleared of the virus. The "Berlin patient," who was later identified as Timothy Ray Brown, had leukemia and wasn't responding to chemotherapy. He received two bone-marrow transplants from a donor with a rare mutation the CCR5 gene, which prevents the virus from entering the cells of the immune system, making people resistant to HIV, and became the first patient to be "cured" of HIV.
Scientists tried to duplicate the results with similar patients, but were never able to succeed, leading some people to believe that the "Berlin" patient had been a fluke.
Until now.
Dr. Ravindra Gupta, an infectious diseases physician at the University of Cambridge and the leader of a paper on the successful treatment, published the results in the journal Nature Tuesday.
The treatment is not a realistic option to treat HIV patients in the near future because stem cell transplants pose risks and their side effects can last for a long time. But the announcement should be celebrated as a milestone in the fight against HIV/AIDS, a disease that affects 36.9 million people worldwide.

Texto completo: Tying Cohen to white supremacy is a reckless generalization
In “The Last Temptation of Michael Cohen" (Ideas, March 3), S.I. Rosenbaum contends that, despite being victims of anti-Semitism, many Jews are perpetrators of white supremacy. It is a peculiar claim that she explains by pointing out that Michael Cohen, the son of a Holocaust survivor, helped “a white supremacist 'autocrat' " become president. She buttresses her claim by citing other Jews whom she believes have enabled President Trump, including Jared Kushner and Stephen Miller, and then invoking the name of another so-called bad Jew, the notorious Roy Cohn.
Many Jews worked for President Obama, and some of President Trump's fiercest critics, such as Bernie Sanders, Adam Schiff, Chuck Schumer, and Dianne Feinstein, are Jews. Yet this does little to temper Rosenbaum's thesis. Her logic is chilling and familiar. Find Jews who have done something of which you disapprove and then argue that these Jews model what other Jews do or think.
Anti-Semitism, like other forms of bigotry, flourishes where reckless generalizations about a people are treated as truths. In the 20th century, National Socialists argued that Jews were responsible for Communism, and Communists argued that Jews were the source of capitalism. The thread that bound these accusations was the propensity to identify Jews with a perceived evil that was believed to threaten public welfare. That impulse has driven anti-Semitism for two millennia, and Rosenbaum seems to have unwittingly embraced it.

We don't have luxury to turn blind eye to anti-Semitism
S.I. Rosenbaum's “The Last Temptation of Michael Cohen" invokes sweeping generalizations about Jews when Cohen's behavior has everything to do with his personal failures and nothing to do with his Jewishness.
In Rosenbaum's world, Jews remain behind the curtain, manipulating and controlling white supremacist infrastructure on behalf of the president. A few people is not the equivalent of a “shocking number." Yes, among the millions of Jews there are racists and xenophobes, just as among African-Americans, Muslims, and other minority groups there are anti-Semites and bigots. To generalize from these realities is unacceptable and feeds into the narrative of anti-Semites.
Referring to Jews who work for the administration as “kapos" trivializes the Holocaust and the memory of millions of victims. Rosenbaum comes dangerously close to blaming the victim, as if Jews are responsible for the rising anti-Semitism because of their own alleged collective racist behavior. Rosenbaum clearly has a personal agenda: to convince Jews that they must align with the progressive left to avoid charges that they are part of the problem.
We don't have the luxury of turning a blind eye to some forms of anti-Semitism, because the threat from all sides is too great. If Jews are “to survive the future," as Rosenbaum puts it, hate and bigotry need to be called out from the left and right, and without denigrating Jews or other groups in the process.

Offensive argument is another case of tyranny of the left
I found S.I. Rosenbaum's opinion piece accusing many Jews of being allies of racists to be remarkably offensive. Her argument is an example of an unfortunately all-too-common current progressive trope: smearing one's political opponents (especially Jewish ones) with the worst epithets possible.
This is how she concludes that the significant number of Jews who voted for, agree with, or serve in the current administration should be called “kapos," a Holocaust-related term that she defiles with her partisanship. This is how she accuses Jews with lighter skin tones of abetting racist persecution, when in fact Jews of all skin tones have been great allies of all persecuted peoples throughout history. And this is how she employs intersectional tyranny to command that all Jews ally with her favored causes, or she will label them as “fascists."
Her approach to telling Jews what to do lest they be regarded as evil leaves me cold, and frankly reminds me of National Socialism. I am an American Jew who does not share Rosenbaum's political opinions, and I reject her disgraceful attempt to tar me and my like-minded coreligionists with her leftist insults.

Note the lessons of Cohen's father
I am appalled by S.I. Rosenbaum's piece about Michael Cohen. Rosenbaum suggests that Cohen's misdeeds on President Trump's behalf were done because Cohen, like many Jews, hides behind his whiteness to protect himself. Rosenbaum speculates that Cohen threw his lot in with Trump as a survival tactic, learned implicitly from his father. However, the only actual evidence of Cohen's father playing a role in his thinking was when Cohen resigned as deputy finance chairman of the Republican National Committee so as not to tarnish the family name, and when he opposed the family separation policy.
Rosenbaum has invented a Jewish motive for supporting white supremacy without fully acknowledging that it is the lessons of Jewish history that ultimately reminded Cohen to do the right thing. Rosenbaum is perpetuating the idea that Jewish values and history lead Jews to be greedy and untrustworthy, and I am deeply disappointed that the Globe saw fit to amplify this voice.

Texto completo: John Hickenlooper, the two-time Colorado governor and former brewpub owner who has overseen Colorado's remarkable economic expansion, declared his candidacy for president Monday.
Hickenlooper, 67, a socially progressive, pro-business Democrat who has called himself an “extreme moderate," had long said he was considering a run, and made early visits to Iowa and New Hampshire. His biggest challenge will be distinguishing himself in what is sure to be a packed field of potentially history-making candidates and deep-pocketed household names.
“I'm running for president because we need dreamers in Washington, but we also need to get things done," he said in a video announcing his candidacy, with the Rocky Mountains as his backdrop.
Hickenlooper plans to run as a “pragmatic progressive," a candidate with extensive executive experience in a primary field of senators. He also suggested that his childhood as a self-declared nerd has prepared him for an electoral battle against the president.
As governor from 2011 until he reached his term limits in 2019, Hickenlooper employed a careful, consensus-building approach that won him praise from both sides of the aisle and helped him guide Colorado out of a recession and through a series of floods, wildfires, and mass shootings in the first years of his tenure. When he left office in January, his state had one of the nation's best economies.
He had also signed a contentious gun control package that included universal background checks, and helped Colorado become the first state in the nation to enact methane capture requirements, a measure he has said was equivalent to taking 320,000 cars off the road every year.
But even in Colorado, fellow Democrats have expressed skepticism that his signature low-key approach will translate to national success.
New York Times
Holder won't run, saying he'll fight gerrymandering
Eric Holder, the former US attorney general, announced Monday that he would not run for president in 2020 and would instead work to end gerrymandering.
“Though I will not run for president in 2020, I will continue to fight for the future of our country through the National Democratic Redistricting Committee and its affiliates," Holder wrote in an opinion article published Monday in The Washington Post.
The National Democratic Redistricting Committee, formed in 2017 under Holder, aims to contest a combination of governorships, legislative seats, and more obscure state offices to chip away at Republicans' control of the redistricting process.
Holder said in a February 2018 interview with The New York Times that the group was mainly focused on denying Republicans in state governments from achieving what is known as a trifecta — a single party controlling the governorship and an entire legislature, as Republicans do in Ohio and Florida, among other battlegrounds.
So far 14 Democrats are officially planning a run for the White House. Holder did not say which candidate he planned to endorse.
New York Times
Bill Clinton has 2020 advice, but few candidates seek it
Nearly 20 years after he left the White House, Bill Clinton is still sought after for advice by some Democrats running for president. But the names on his dance card recently underscore how much his standing in the party has changed.
So far, none of the party's early front-runners has had a formal meeting with Clinton. Nor have the women who are running in the historically diverse primary field.
Instead, Clinton has spoken mostly with male candidates who are considered longshots for the Democratic nomination, including Montana Governor Steve Bullock, former Housing secretary Julian Castro, and former Maryland representative John Delaney.
Clinton remains one of Democrats' most successful politicians of the last half-century and one of its strongest messengers on the economy. Yet the party has shifted considerably to the left since his two terms in White House, and his personal baggage — as well as lingering hostilities from his wife Hillary Clinton's failed 2016 campaign — make him an awkward adviser for some in his party's next class of presidential hopefuls.
Tensions run particularly deep between the Clintons and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, who has launched another bid for the White House. The Clintons blame Sanders for damaging Hillary Clinton during the 2016 primary.
Neither side tried to mask the tensions in the days since Sanders launched his 2020 campaign. When asked Friday on ABC's "The View" whether he would seek campaign advice from Hillary Clinton, Sanders said: "I think not."

Fast food at White House for N. Dakota football champs
The smell of burgers and fries wafted through the State Dining Room as President Trump celebrated the championship football players from North Dakota State on Monday with fast food, like he did when he honored the national champion Clemson Tigers.
Trump told the team he could have had White House chefs prepare a meal, but "I know you people very well."
The players laughed with the president while eyeing stacks of Big Macs and Chick-fil-A sandwiches on a long table in the center of the room. A side table was piled with bags of french fries, kept warm under a light.
Trump served a similar spread that included hundreds of hamburgers to Clemson's players in January. He said he personally paid for that meal because much of the staff in the White House residence had been furloughed by a government shutdown.
The Bison, who have the most titles in the NCAA Football Championship Subdivision, ended the season on Jan. 5 with a 38-24 win over Eastern Washington University.
It was the Bison's seventh national title in eight years.

Texto completo: Unlike most other plantations that are open for tours, the Whitney Plantation focuses on slavery and tells detailed stories of enslaved people.
I like to think of myself as fairly knowledgeable about history, but I had never heard until that trip of the German Coast rebellion in 1811. More than 500 enslaved people participated in the well-organized but failed revolt.
Some of the uprising's leaders were executed and their decapitated heads were displayed on spikes along River Road as warnings to other slaves.
Some people might not want to spend part of their Christmastime with family revisiting some brutal moments in the nation's history, but I would argue that there is no better time.
And my sister and I were not alone. We almost couldn't get tickets because of the high demand for Whitney Plantation tours the week after Christmas.
I thought about our trip to Whitney this past weekend, which was the 160th anniversary of the largest known slave auction in American history. Generally called the Weeping Time, the sale was held at the Ten Broeck Race Course in what is now west Savannah.
The Georgia Historical Society and City of Savannah erected a historical marker about the Weeping Time along Augusta Avenue not far from the race course, but few visitors to the city will learn about the tragic auction.
In 2014, a New York Times piece spurred considerable local debate about the lack of visibility of African American history generally and slavery specifically in the experience of tourists to Savannah. There seems to be a growing demand for authenticity in heritage tourism, and I would say anecdotally that there are more tours and tour guides today that deal forthrightly with slavery in Savannah's history.
The Telfair Museums recently expanded its interpretations of slavery at the renamed Owens-Thomas House & Slave Quarters, and so has the Historic Savannah Foundation's Davenport House Museum, whose director Jamie Credle wrote last year in this newspaperabout a research trip to New Orleans that included a tour of the Whitney Plantation.
There are other laudable efforts to present Savannah's history more honestly, but we will always be limited to some degree by geography. We don't have a tourist destination like Whitney Plantation or McLeod Plantation near Charleston. The site of Ten Broeck Race Course has been divided into multiple properties and is split by I-516.
But we seem to have a growing community who want to get the stories right despite the limitations. It will be interesting to see where those efforts lead.

Texto completo: Purdue Pharma is launching a counterattack against a lawsuit filed by Attorney General Maura Healey that alleges the company, which makes opioid painkillers including OxyContin, misled the public and prescribers about its drugs' risks of addiction and overdose.
In a motion to dismiss the Massachusetts lawsuit, Purdue argues the suit makes outrageous claims but lacks the factual foundation or legal merits to put forward such assertions. It says the state fails to demonstrate that Purdue's products and actions caused the opioid crisis, as the suit contends.
The judge, Purdue's motion says, should “dismiss the Commonwealth's [lawsuit] as oversimplified scapegoating based on a distorted account of the facts unsupported by applicable law.
“To be sure, there is an opioid crisis in the Commonwealth," the motion continues, “but the responsibility for this crisis cannot, as a matter of law, be tied to one company that manufactures a tiny fraction of the prescription opioids in the Commonwealth."
The 45-page motion serves as Purdue's effort to push back against claims that generated national media attention and painted Purdue and its officials as driven by profits and pushing sales representatives to score more prescriptions.
In the motion, Purdue seeks to distance itself from overdose deaths that are now occurring. It cites data from the Massachusetts Department of Public Health showing that fatal overdoses are being largely caused by heroin and illicit fentanyl, not prescription painkillers. It also references language from the state health department that says “no single substance or health care practice is solely responsible for the current opioid crisis."
As a result, the motion states, “Purdue's medications (let alone Purdue's alleged conduct) cannot, as a matter of law, be the cause of the opioid abuse crisis."
(Purdue critics argue that many people became addicted to opioids by first taking painkillers and then shifted to using heroin or other illicit opioids.)
A Healey representative said the attorney general's office would oppose Purdue's motion.
The Massachusetts suit also names as defendants Purdue executives and members of the billionaire Sackler family, which controls the privately held company. The suit alleges that certain officials, including onetime CEO Dr. Richard Sackler, demanded that sales representatives convince clinicians to write more prescriptions at higher doses and for longer periods of time.
But in its motion, Purdue argues that it sells a variety of doses of OxyContin so that prescribers can match a patient with a proper treatment. It says that its medications are marketed for uses that are approved by the Food and Drug Administration and that the company has been upfront about the risks associated with its drugs.
(A recently disclosed 2015 deposition of Richard Sackler suggested that he supported a decision to conceal OxyContin's strength from doctors in 1997, a year after the drug was launched, though Purdue said that “the company accurately disclosed the potency of OxyContin.")
Purdue's motion also expands on its past statements that said the lawsuit cherry-picked quotes and inaccurately characterized company messages.
The lawsuit, for example, alleges that Richard Sackler responded to news of 59 deaths from OxyContin by saying, “This is not too bad. It could have been far worse." But according to the motion, Sackler was talking about a New York Times article that mentioned the 59 deaths when he wrote that and “was merely commenting about the nature of recent press coverage."
The motion made public Monday is only Purdue's; the other defendants in the Massachusetts lawsuit — company executives and members of the Sackler family, including Richard — have a later deadline to submit motions.
Purdue, along with other companies in the opioid supply chain, is being sued by more than a thousand cities, counties, states, and tribes. Most of the cases have been consolidated in a massive federal case in Ohio. While that case is proceeding, Purdue has had some success in knocking off claims in state courts. A Connecticut judge, for example, in January dismissed suits brought by three dozen cities and towns against the drugmaker.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- Justice Clarence Thomas was busy in February. As usual, he asked no questions during Supreme Court arguments. But he made up for his silence with three opinions in eight days that took issue with some of the court's most prominent precedents.
He called on Feb. 19 for the court to reconsider New York Times v. Sullivan, the 1964 decision that provided the press with broad First Amendment protections against libel suits brought by public officials. The Sullivan case -- and rulings extending it -- Justice Thomas wrote, "were policy-driven decisions masquerading as constitutional law."
The next day, he criticized Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision that established a constitutional right to abortion, calling it "notoriously incorrect" and the product of misguided efforts to identify and protect fundamental rights under the due process clause of the 14th amendment.
A week later, he expressed skepticism about Gideon v. Wainwright, the 1963 decision that said the Sixth Amendment requires the government to provide lawyers to poor people accused of serious crimes. Justice Thomas wrote that the Sixth Amendment, as understood by those who drafted and ratified it, guaranteed only the right to hire a lawyer.
The opinions underscored two distinctive aspects of Justice Thomas's jurisprudence. He tries to unearth the original meaning of the Constitution, and he has no use for precedents that have veered from that original understanding.
At the Federalist Society's annual dinner in 2013, he was asked about the doctrine of stare decisis, which is legal shorthand for respect for precedent and Latin for "to stand by things decided."
"Stare decisis doesn't hold much force for you?" Judge Diane S. Sykes of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit asked him during a public conversation at the dinner.
"Oh, it sure does," Justice Thomas responded. "But not enough to keep me from going to the Constitution."
According to data gathered by Stephen L. Wasby, an emeritus professor of political science at the University at Albany, Justice Thomas has written more than 250 concurring or dissenting opinions seriously questioning precedents, calling for their reconsideration or suggesting that they be overruled.
Almost one-third of the opinions concerned the rights of criminal defendants, Professor Wasby found, while others called for a fresh look at decisions on issues such as free speech, religion, voting, the separation of powers and federalism.
In a 2007 essay, Tom Goldstein, a prominent Supreme Court litigator and a co-founder of Scotusblog, wrote that "Justice Thomas's extreme view of stare decisis has three features that distinguish him from the rest of the court."
The first is "unflinching" honesty: "If he thinks the old cases should be discarded, he says so."
The second is intellectual ambition: "He is thinking big and tackling the serious questions in constitutional law to which the court has not given a fresh look in decades."
The third is his attitude toward precedent in constitutional cases: "He does not give stare decisis any weight."
That last point is not in dispute. Justice Antonin Scalia, who died in 2016, had a blunt assessment of Justice Thomas's approach to precedent. "He does not believe in stare decisis, period," Justice Scalia told one of Justice Thomas's biographers.
Josh Blackman, a professor at South Texas College of Law Houston, said Justice Thomas's statements are often addressed to potential litigants.
"Justice Thomas, more than any other justice, is willing to revisit and reverse old precedents that are inconsistent with the Constitution's original meaning," Professor Blackman said. "However, he will not reverse an old precedent unless the parties raise the argument in what he deems an 'appropriate case.' Therefore, he will often ask the parties to raise the argument in a future case."
Justice Thomas uses that phrase -- "in an appropriate case" -- to invite challenges to precedents he considers misguided. In February's libel opinion, for instance, he said he was writing "to explain why, in an appropriate case, we should reconsider" the Sullivan case and decisions that have built on it.
In a blog post about the 2013 Federalist Society dinner, David Lat, the founding editor of the legal website Above the Law, jokingly wrote that Justice Thomas must have a shortcut on his computer that saves him a few keystrokes whenever he wants to call for reconsideration of a precedent "in an appropriate case."
Justice Thomas's views can seem idiosyncratic and therefore inconsequential. He often writes only for himself. No other justice, for instance, joined his libel opinion.
But there is little question that calls for reconsideration of precedents can have an effect. They embolden litigants and seem to figure in the court's decisions to agree to hear cases.
In the current term alone, the Supreme Court agreed to re-examine at least three precedents after Justice Thomas, along with other members of the court, called for their reconsideration.
One of the cases concerns procedures for suing in federal court over the government's seizure of property by eminent domain. In 2005, Justice Thomas joined an opinion calling for reconsideration of the governing precedent "in an appropriate case."
The court is also considering whether to overrule decisions allowing the same crimes to be prosecuted separately in state and federal courts. In 2016, Justice Thomas joined an opinion calling for "fresh examination" of the question "in an appropriate case."
Later this month, the court will hear arguments about whether to overrule two important administrative law decisions that generally require judges to defer to agencies' interpretations of their own regulations.
In 2016, dissenting from the court's decision not to hear an earlier case on the issue, Justice Thomas expressed frustration.
"Any reader of this court's opinions should think that the doctrine is on its last gasp," he wrote. "Members of this court have repeatedly called for its reconsideration in an appropriate case."

Texto completo: Your TV GPS, Globe TV critic Matthew Gilbert's look at the week ahead in television, appears every Monday morning on BostonGlobe.com. Today's column covers March 4-10.
ARE YOU FONDA STEFON?
It has been a while since “Saturday Night Live" characters have made it to the big screen. The last one, I believe, was “MacGruber," which brought in a meager $8.5 million at the box office in 2010.
There were rumors of a movie about New York City nightclub correspondent Stefon — actually, Stefon Meyers — who was played by the ever-breaking Bill Hader and written by John Mulaney. But they were dispelled in 2014 when, in an interview with Joe Berkowitz of Fast Company, Hader said, “It was a nice thing that lived on 'Weekend Update,' and it should probably only live on 'SNL' and that's that."
For Stefon fans, that's a bit of a bummer. It's that thing where you love watching Stefon and you want more, more, more, even if you know that a Stefon movie (and its requisite Ben Affleck cameo) would probably stink and leave you deflated.
Well, here's some information about what might have been. There is a “Late Night With Seth Meyers Podcast," and, on Monday, the podcast features Meyers talking off-air to Mulaney about the never-made movie. Meyers, who hosted “Update," and Stefon ultimately got married, but Meyers feels that Stefon would need a new love interest for the movie.
“The only thing I wanted to have happen in that movie — and maybe it was Bill's idea — was that I wanted, in the first scene, to agree to go out with Stefon," Meyers says. “And then a superfast cut of us at all the clubs, and then I was then zipped into a body bag . . . and then it would pan up to Stefon saying, 'He's dead.' And that would be it."
Mulaney has different ideas. “I had no problem violating your real life as an individual who was engaged and married and you had a girlfriend and fiancée, and we paid no mind to that," he says to Meyers. “I believe in the movie you would fully end up together."
WHAT I'M WATCHING THIS WEEK
1. World texts Oprah: Help, just saw MJ doc.
Oprah texts World: I'm there for you.
I'm still haunted by HBO's “Leaving Neverland," which I reviewed for the Globe last week. The four-hour, two-part documentary — in which two men allege in painful detail that they were sexually abused by Michael Jackson as children — is extremely persuasive and disturbing. It's an important post-Weinstein document, as it shows how victims sometimes grapple with coming out across decades. The second part airs on Monday at 8 p.m., and immediately afterward, at 10, HBO and OWN are simulcasting “Oprah Winfrey Presents: After Neverland," featuring accusers Wade Robson and James Safechuck and an audience that includes survivors of sexual abuse. Oprah is aware that many unwavering Jackson fans are not going to like the show: “I'm gonna get it," she says during the taping.
2. Think what you will about Ricky Gervais's awards-show hosting style, he has made some brilliant TV, not least of all the original “The Office" and a series called “Extras" (that features this David Bowie classic). On Friday, his new six-episode series, “After Life," will be available on Netflix, and I'm all about watching it. It's about a guy who falls into depression after his wife dies — but it's classified as a comedy, so don't be scared off.
3. For some, last week's testimony by Michael Cohen triggered memories of John Dean's five-day testimony in 1973 (it did for Dean, who wrote this comparison for the New York Times). If you're so inclined, CNN is premiering a four-part series called “Tricky Dick" that traces the arc of President Richard Nixon's career, on Sunday at 9 p.m. It explores Nixon's rise, fall, comeback, and, finally, political destruction.
4. Think, and stop your day dreaming, because there ain't no way you'll want to miss this. Tyler Perry is hosting “Aretha! A Grammy Celebration for the Queen of Soul," a two-hour tribute concert airing on CBS Sunday at 9 p.m. The lineup includes Smokey Robinson, Kelly Clarkson, Common, Celine Dion, Jennifer Hudson, Alicia Keys, John Legend, Patti LaBelle, Brandi Carlile, H.E.R., and Janelle Monáe, who sings “Rock Steady."
5. “Serial" fans, you will never, ever leave this case behind. Beginning Sunday at 9 p.m., HBO is premiering a four-part series called “The Case Against Adnan Syed," which reexamines the murder of high school student Hae Min Lee and the conviction of her ex-boyfriend. The docu-series will look into Syed's recent quest for a new trial and interviews with people not featured in the podcast.
6. Please, pretty please, make it good. Emmy Rossum says farewell to Showtime's “Shameless" on Sunday at 9 p.m., in the season finale. Will we still want to take in the insanities of the Gallagher home, now that Fiona — it's anchor for so many years — won't be there? Stay tuned for next season, the series' 10th, for the answer.
7. I'm not a Jonas Brothers fan, but I feel it is my duty to inform you that they are back together after six years, they have a new single out called “Sucker," and it's Jonas Brothers week on CBS's “The Late Late Show With James Corden," Monday through Thursday at 12:35 a.m.
8. Greg Araki has made some apocalypse-ish and queer-themed movies including “Mysterious Skin" and “The Living End." He's bringing his vision to TV with “Now Apocalypse," which he's writing with Vogue sex columnist Karley Sciortino and co-producing with Steven Soderbergh and Gregory Jacobs. It's about a group of four friends dating and pursuing fame in Los Angeles. (Here's the preview.) It premieres on Starz Sunday at 9 p.m.
CHANNEL SURFING
“Juanita"
Alfre Woodard stars in this movie as a mother of three grown kids who heads to Paper Moon, Mont., to reinvent herself. Netflix, Friday
“The Order"
A 10-episode series about a college kid who joins a secret society involved in a war with werewolves and such. Netflix, Thursday
“American Gods"
Season two of the Neil Gaiman adaptation finally arrives after some backstage turmoil. Starz, Sunday, 8 p.m.
“A.P. Bio"
Glenn Howerton continues to “teach" high school as the sitcom returns for season two. NBC, Thursday, 8:30 p.m.
COMEDY IS CENTRAL
I'm in a Comedy Central zone these days. The basic cable channel has satisfied for years with its late-night programming, notably “The Daily Show." But right now, I'm tuning in for three sharp sitcoms.
1. Now in its first season, “The Other Two" is a witty and, when need be, demented comedy about the two underachieving siblings of a Justin Bieber-like pop star. From former “SNL" writers Chris Kelly and Sarah Schneider, it's about their soul-damaging envy, the absurdities of their brother's world of fame, and their “Difficult People"-like rapport. Helene Yorke and Drew Tarver are great as the siblings, and Molly Shannon is winning, as always, as their mother.
2. “Corporate" is trying new things in its second season, including two nicely focused episodes — one about the empty office on Labor Day and another about the realities behind an expense report. The show follows two would-be executives, played by show creators Matt Ingebretson and Jake Weisman, caught in a comically Kafkaesque corporation called, ominously, Hampton Deville. The show sits nicely beside “The Office," “Better Off Ted," and “Workaholics." In my review of season one, I wrote, “It's funny in an uncompromisingly nihilistic way, it never resolves into artificial sweetness, and the ensemble seems to be having a great time." I stand by that.
3. It's going to be hard to say goodbye to “Broad City," now in the middle of its final season. But Ilana Glazer and Abbi Jacobson are taking us out on a high, with a series of episodes that capture their warm friendship as strongly as ever. The premiere, told through Instagram stories, is a kick, and a later episode about Ilana's “one-year anniversary-renegotiation-check in" with boyfriend Lincoln is memorably bittersweet.

Justice Thomas's Call to Ease Libel Law

Texto completo: To the Editor:
Re "Justice Thomas Calls for Reconsideration of a Landmark 1964 Libel Ruling" (news article, Feb. 20):
Two points concerning Justice Clarence Thomas's plea to abandon New York Times v. Sullivan and its progeny:
First, Justice Thomas's cramped reading of Sullivan misses the Supreme Court's central claim. The court wasn't protecting freedom of the press as an end in itself but rather giving the press some latitude in facilitating, in Justice William Brennan's choice words, the "uninhibited, robust and wide-open debate" that self-governance demands.
Justice Thomas's understanding of libel law, should it prevail, would put us in league with Singapore and other countries where public officials use libel law to intimidate the press and curtail public discourse.
Second, Justice Thomas's call to reconsider the Sullivan case, on the grounds that it doesn't comport with what the authors of the Constitution originally wrote and presumably meant, illustrates the folly of "originalist" thinking.
Justice Thomas's position would strip justices of the power to revisit and revise the meaning of the Constitution; it would make a mockery of the idea of the Constitution as a living document.
Theodore L. Glasser
Palo Alto, Calif.
The writer is professor emeritus of communication at Stanford University.
To the Editor:
If Justice Clarence Thomas's call for reconsidering New York Times v. Sullivan goes anywhere, President Trump should be very worried. Even though Mr. Trump loudly calls for making it easier to sue for libel, it's hard to think of anyone who has maliciously accused more people of more things with less proof.
Be careful what you wish for ...

The work and wisdom of Ella Baker

Texto completo: Headnote Celebrating an unsung civil rights heroine
As we celebrate Women's History Month, let's remember a woman who made significant contributions to the Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s-1960s, but may not be as well-known as others like Rosa Parks, Mary McCloud Bethune and Dorothy Height.
Although a center for human rights in Oakland, California, is named in honor of Ella Baker, who was a key figure in the Civil Rights Movement, she is largely unknown by many outside the movement, as well as activists and academics.
Who was Ella Baker?
Ella Jo Baker was born on Dec. 13, 1903, in Norfolk, Virginia. Growing up in North Carolina, she developed a sense for social justice early on, due in part to her grandmother's stories about life under slavery.
She studied at Shaw University in Raleigh, North Carolina. After graduating in 1927 as class valedictorian, Baker moved to New York City and began joining social activist organizations.
In 1930, she joined the Young Negroes Cooperative League, whose purpose was to develop Black economic power through collective planning. She also involved herself with several women's organizations. She was committed to economic justice for all people and once said, "People cannot be free until there is enough work in this land to give everybody a job."
Baker worked in the South as a field organizer for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in the mid-1950s. After the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and other clergymen founded the Southern Christian Leadership Conference in 1957, King asked Baker to establish its national office and serve as its executive director.
Baker left the SCLC after the sit-ins in Greensboro, North Carolina, where a group of Black college students from North Carolina A&T University refused to leave a Woolworth's lunch counter where they had been denied service on Feb. 1, 1960.
In April 1960 at Shaw University, she organized the conference for the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, which emerged from a wave of student sit-ins to protest segregation and became one of the major Civil Rights Movement organizations of the 1960s.
During the campaign to register Blacks as voters in Mississippi, Baker helped to found the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party. The party was formed before the 1964 Democratic National Convention by Black Democrats who were barred from the Mississippi delegation.
Baker's views are still relevant today.
Baker believed voting was one key to social change, which is still true today. We must use our vote to influence the policies and laws that impact our lives.
She fought for the right to be heard in a male-dominated movement with strong egos.
And finally, another reason why Baker stands out among past leaders is her belief in the power of grassroots action.
"You didn't see me on television, you didn't see news stories about me," reported the New York Times in her obituary. "The kind of role that I tried to play was to pick up pieces or put together pieces out of which I hoped organization might come. My theory is, strong people don't need strong leaders."
Those words sum up Baker's view on how to create change. She believed that it is important to develop the people to advocate for themselves to achieve change and not depend on one powerful leader. She was distrustful of charismatic messianic leadership.
This view is still essential to the challenges faced today by those who seek equality and justice.
To be clear, this is not a call for anarchy, but a movement that is not dependent on one "great leader" and top-down leadership.
This is already starting to happen. A wave of first-time minority and women candidates were elected to Congress last November largely in response to President Donald Trump's divisiveness.
The Time's Up and #MeToo movement has also put the spotlight on the treatment of women and gender inequality.
These are signs of grassroots movements spreading across the nation for justice and equality that reflect Baker's organizing philosophy that "strong people don't need strong leaders."
As we celebrate Women's History Month, let's remember the legacy and emulate the example set by unsung civil rights heroine Ella Baker.

Texto completo: Sometimes players miss shots and sometimes journalists do, too. So when a few of us were speaking with Allonzo Trier after he led the Knicks with 22 points Thursday night, he spoke about playing with aggressiveness on offense that he had lost for a stretch. And as I tried to follow up on it, I used the word "confidence" rather than "aggressiveness."
Trier immediately responded, "I don't lack confidence."
That statement has been true since he arrived with the Knicks as an undrafted free agent last summer. Though his play may be filled with inconsistency, Trier - who has scored at least 18 points in four of his last six games - has never lacked  confidence.
Perhaps it's a residual effect of having been in the spotlight since he was a pre-teen - the subject of a New York Times Magazine story as he made his way through the AAU circuit as a national sensation. Even when teams passed on him in the draft after three seasons at Arizona, it never caused his confidence in his own ability to waver.
He pinned the gap in his performance on trying to find his way into a role. Knicks coach David Fizdale sought to have Trier become more of a complete guard, working to get his teammates involved, and Trier finally returned to what got him here - aggressiveness.
Definitely not confidence, but aggressiveness.
"I don't think [the game] slowed down," Trier said. "I think it slowed down earlier, but then I got in a stretch where we were talking and he was really asking me to kind of, not change how I'm playing but focus on different areas of my game, and it was more about trying to find guys and I don't want to say be unselfish but look to make the right reads and be aware of passes, and I kind of turned down my aggressiveness.
"And what I do best is score the ball, and I was kind of thinking pass first. And it kind of took away from how I was playing. I just had to be able to find a balance and get back to being who I am and what I do best, really, honestly. I've just got to come out and be aggressive, honestly, be who I am and not try to change who I am as a basketball player. Do what I do best."
That is a large part of the player development process that the Knicks are preaching. Some of it must fall on the player himself, not just to work on refining the physical aspects of his skill set but also to find what works and what doesn't.
Some of that may be adjusting to the NBA and countering the adjustments that opposing teams already have made.
"It's my first year playing here and I'm trying to figure that out on the go," Trier said. "So that's a part of my growth, going through stretches where I may not be playing as well or I may not be putting up the same numbers. It's honestly about me just continuing to learn the game and putting it all together. So each game I'm going to learn new things and get better, whether I score a lot of points or I miss a lot of shots or anything like that, you know? It's about just continuing to build and putting it together."
The wall
One thing that Trier feels as strongly about as his confidence? The rookie wall, or the lack of one.
Some of his teammates say playing the arduous NBA schedule is a learned skill, but Trier doesn't believe his struggles have been caused by any kind of rookie wall.
"No, that's like a fairy tale," he said. "That's like a myth to me.
I didn't hit a rookie wall. I just went through a place where I was going through a part of learning the game and trying to put it all together in my first season. The best way to go through and learn is going through the experience, and that's what I'm doing right now."
Still here 
The Knicks moved quickly after the trade deadline to waive Enes Kanter and Wes Matthews, allowing them to sign with playoff-bound teams while the Knicks continued on their path to the draft lottery. After coming to New York along with Matthews in the trade with Dallas, however, DeAndre Jordan is still a Knick.
It doesn't seem to make a lot of sense, given that Jordan will be a free agent at season's end and could help a contender now. He's second in the NBA in rebounding and field-goal percentage. But he has been content to play out the season in New York, serving as a mentor to Mitchell Robinson and the rest of the young Knicks.
"I don't know if it was me convincing him," David Fizdale said. "I think Scott Perry and Steve [Mills] had a lot to do with that. I think he sees the situation here as a good situation for him for this year, with him having a real purpose in helping this group, and possibly a future."

YANGSZE CHOO'S NIGHT TIGER' MERGES TWO MALAYSIAN TALES

Texto completo: To read a novel by Palo Alto author Yangsze Choo is to enter a provocative other world swirled by mysticism, Chinese folklore, dreams, fantasy, mystery and romance. A vigorous researcher, Choo populates swift-moving narratives with multigenerational characters whose vulnerabilities, flaws and strengths cast broad, entirely believable human rainbows. Remarkably, her storytelling achieves a now/then duality with prescient, future-driven plots also rich in historic, culturally accurate details.
The New York Times best-selling writer's second book, "The Night Tiger" (Flatiron Books, $26.99), follows Choo's well-received 2013 debut, "The Ghost Bride." The new novel centers on the search for the owner of a corroded, severed finger suspended in a vial and on five characters whose lives interweave in 1930's colonial Malaysia. Mysterious deaths, man-eating tigers, tension between classes, gender inequities and more are revealed in two protagonists' alternating voices: 11-year-old houseboy Ren's experience unfurls in third person present; Ji Lin, a dressmaker's apprentice who secretly works as a dancehall girl to pay off her mother's debts, springs to life in first person, past tense.
"I thought that by using both voices, it would bring them closer to the reader," says Choo, 45, in an interview. Choo also adheres to strict principles of her own: "Entering a book is like entering a dream you must sustain for the reader. Historical fiction, it must feel rooted in the right time. I wrote the two novels about places I'd been to. I must know how hot it feels, the smell of the rain. I went to towns to check distances; learned what people were eating and thinking in the 1930s from microfiche newspaper archives in the national library in Singapore. There's a slightly swimmy feeling if you read, and that kind of thing is not right."
Choo is a fourth-generation Malaysian of Chinese descent whose father's career as a diplomat gave her a peripatetic childhood. Raised in Thailand, Germany, Japan and Singapore, she graduated from Harvard University and worked as a management consultant before writing "Ghost Bride." Despite moving frequently, she recalls her family's treasured books a "traveling mini library" of Malaysian history, traveler's' first-person accounts, classic gothic English novels, Chinese comic books and National Geographic magazines. "They made me interested in animals. One about whales, it came with a plastic record in a sleeve insert. You could hear the whales. I thought it was amazing," she says.
To this day, Choo describes her greatest fear as "what I would do if there were no books to read." A favorite childhood memory involves a time when her father returned from a trip to London with a large bag of books. "My sister and I were overjoyed." Now that she reads on a phone or e-reader, she says the terror of not having a book in hand has been removed. Even so, she's never far from admired authors' latest works: Oyinkan Braithwaite's "My Sister, the Serial Killer," Haruki Murakami's "Killing Commendatore" and others. Novels with well-written, swift-moving prose or meandering narratives that sweep her to "a galaxy one over from ours" reaffirm her conviction that the best fiction feels experiential. "When Murakami describes a sandwich, I want to eat it. His books are transporting," says Choo.
If books sweep us to other worlds, they also must be emotionally and psychologically rewarding and relevant, Choo suggests. Each character in "Tiger" is flawed, but endearingly so. We believe in and feel sympathy for the orphaned Ren, whose life as a servant is far from the privileged existence of the three doctors he works for. Ji LIn's feminism is a nuanced blend of rebellion and anomalous acceptance of patriarchal systems and attitudes in the medical field and 1930s South East Asian society.
She found herself surprised by twist and turns in the plot and unexpected characters who appeared during the four years she wrote "Tiger," but Choo had already learned from her first book to cut extraneous words. "I was more mindful of word count. With two narratives, it's two books in one. It could have been chunky. I found freedom in cutting scenes I realized were boring."
She writes instinctively, always starting with a single scene. "I can only see a little down the road. At one point, Tiger' topped out at 200,000 words! The practice of figuring out what you don't need, has beauty. I much prefer the writing to pruning, but both are important."
Her first novel, "The Ghost Bride," is now being made into a Netflix series, and she is ecstatic about it. "When I saw the trailer, I was in tears. When they said they wanted to make it as a Chinese series, I felt happy, because it's more authentic. It's about the Chinese afterlife, which is like an ornate bureaucracy and a strong narrative in Chinese literature."
Although she says starting a new novel while still in the "half-life of muttering along about Night Tiger' while driving or vacuuming," she does have a first scene in mind. When she questions her ability to ever complete another novel, she gives herself the same answer as in the past. "It will just have to be written, to see where the story goes," she says,

Texto completo: BEIRUT, Lebanon -- The office of Saudi Arabia's public prosecutor said late Friday it had completed its investigation into a group of women's rights activists, accused of working to "undermine the security" of the kingdom, and was preparing to put them on trial.
Human rights groups have criticized the treatment of the activists, who were arrested last spring but have yet to face formal charges. Some of the activists were subjected to torture during interrogation, according to relatives and others briefed on their cases. Saudi Arabia denies that any were mistreated.
The group includes both women and men. Some had campaigned openly for Saudi Arabia to lift its ban on women driving, while others had supported the cause in quieter ways. Some members of the group were in the process of opening a shelter for abused women when they were arrested, including a man who donated land for the project. He was later released, but others were not.
The activists were detained last year as the kingdom was preparing to lift its ban on women driving, leading many to assume that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the kingdom's day-to-day ruler, did not want to share credit for the change with activists who had pushed for it.
After the arrests, the Saudi public prosecutor's office accused the activists of working to "undermine the security and stability of the kingdom." It said they had admitted to collaborating with parties "hostile to the kingdom," recruited government employees to give them confidential information and gave "financial and moral support to hostile elements abroad."
But the statement did not say they were officially being charged with any crimes.
Of 17 people arrested in the case, the prosecutor said, eight had been granted temporary release, while nine were still being held.
The government did not identify the suspects, but at least one Saudi newspaper and several websites published their names and photos, stamped with the word "traitor," and said they could face lengthy prison sentences.
The prosecutor's statement on Friday signaled the next step in the legal process, with the cases transferred to the courts. It did not say when trials were likely to begin.
Saudi Arabia's human rights record has come under greater scrutiny since the killing of the dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agents in Istanbul in October. While members of Congress have pressed to punish the kingdom, President Trump had stood by Prince Mohammed, considering him a key ally in the Middle East and a reliable buyer of American weapons.
The prosecutor's statement came days after President Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, met with Prince Mohammed in Riyadh, the Saudi capital, during a tour of the Middle East to try to build support for his unannounced plan for peace between Israel and the Palestinians. It is unclear whether Mr. Kushner raised Mr. Khashoggi's killing or the rights activists' case during the meeting.
Both cases have strained relations with many countries in the West, including with Canada, whose ambassador was expelled from the kingdom after Canada's Foreign Ministry called for the activists' release.
Friday's statement angered relatives of the detainees.
"Can we know the results of the investigation and the torture before the detained women are transferred to trial?" Walid al-Hathloul, whose sister Loujain al-Hathloul is among the detainees, wrote on Twitter. "If there was a confession, it was a confession under torture."
Any formal legal action against the group would face questions and doubts abroad because of allegations that, after their arrest, the activists were held in private facilities and beaten, electrocuted, insulted and sexually harassed. The abuse of one detainee was so severe that she tried to kill herself, according to people briefed on her case who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution.
In January, the sister of Ms. al-Hathloul, one of the most prominent of the detainees, wrote in an Op-Ed in The New York Times that during a family visit, her sister "was shaking uncontrollably, unable to hold her grip, to walk or sit normally."
Her parents asked her about torture on a later visit and she said she had been "held in solitary confinement, beaten, waterboarded, given electric shocks, sexually harassed and threatened with rape and murder," the sister, Alia al-Hathloul, wrote.
In an interview on Saturday, she said an investigator had recently forced her sister to sign a letter written in her name asking for a pardon from the king. She said it was unclear whether the government was really planning to try the activists or was seeking a way to end a case that has tarnished Prince Mohammed's reputation as a reformer and advocate for women's rights.
"They are unpredictable," Ms. al-Hathloul said of kingdom officials.

The great hypocrisy of the Green New Deal

Texto completo: Not ready for prime time. That was the consensus reaction to the Green New Deal, released last month by freshman Rep. Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.
The Economist called the proposal “deeply unserious.” A Washington Post editorial labeled it as “fantasy.” New York Times columnist David Brooks wrote that it would result in “the greatest centralization of power in the hands of the Washington elite in our history.”
But the Green New Deal isn’t just lousy policy. It’s incredibly hypocritical.
In boosting the plan, for instance, Ocasio-Cortez tweeted that “the world will end in 12 years if we don’t address climate change.” It was a hyperbolic summary of an alarmist and scientifically unsound United Nations report on greenhouse gas emissions.
Enter, the hypocrisy.
If a climate change-induced existential crisis were, indeed, just around the corner, the most rationale response would be to gin up all the nuclear power the world can get. After all, in 2017 nuclear provided more than half (56 percent) of the country’s emissions-free electricity — more than triple the amount we get from wind and 18 times more than solar generates generation.
But, according to the now-deleted FAQ sheet from Ocasio-Cortez’s office, “The Green New Deal makes new fossil fuel infrastructure or nuclear plants unnecessary.” Launching “a massive mobilization of all our resources into renewable energies,” while eliminating emissions-free nuclear power is the most inefficient and expensive approach to carbon reduction possible.
The hypocrisy doesn’t end there.
Green New Dealers are trying to sell their policies in the name of economic security and justice. However, policies that take away affordable, reliable power from American families are highly regressive. Higher energy costs hit low-income households hardest, because they spend a higher percentage of their budget on energy. The higher these costs climb, the more they are forced to make difficult choices between keeping the heat on or providing food for their family or perhaps going to the doctor.
Higher energy prices mean more than just having less money available for other necessities. It means having to spend more for all of the goods and services you purchase. That’s because energy is a critical component of manufacturing, communications and transportation—all of which are involved in getting goods and services to your household.
The Green New Deal doesn’t lead to more economic security and justice. It leads to greater economic strain, with low-income families being stressed the most.
And where’s the justice in cronyism and corporate welfare. The Green New Deal would open the floodgates of both.
Ocasio-Cortez rightly blasted New York’s special tax breaks for Amazon’s proposed HQ2. Offering up billions in state and city special tax breaks left a sour taste in many peoples’ mouths.
Cronyism works for big companies because they can offer a lot: investment, jobs and prosperity. But it is not a strategy for long-term economic success because it comes at the expense of other investments and opportunities. The investments will come when there’s an attractive, level-playing field for all companies to compete.
The Green New Deal would introduce significantly higher level of cronyism because Ocasio-Cortez wants the federal government (i.e., American taxpayers) to pay for the whole thing.
Remember Solyndra, the half-billion dollar solar boondoggle that went belly up? That’s just a small taste of things to come under a Green New Deal that puts potentially trillions of dollars up for grabs. As was the case with Solyndra, when the feds start picking energy technologies and companies to fund, they are essentially gambling with other peoples’ money. And there is never a guarantee the bet will pay off.
Solyndra is merely one example of a failed company that could not survive even with the federal government’s help. And there are many other examples of green cronyism that even more closely parallel New York’s erstwhile deal with Amazon, which Ocasio-Cortez found so distasteful. Taxpayers gave money or government-backed loans to companies that already enjoyed large market capitalization and/or substantial private investors. Federal “investment” wasn’t needed.

Texto completo: Not ready for prime time. That was the consensus reaction to the Green New Deal, released last month by freshman Rep. Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.
The Economist called the proposal “deeply unserious.” A Washington Post editorial labeled it as “fantasy.” New York Times columnist David Brooks wrote that it would result in “the greatest centralization of power in the hands of the Washington elite in our history.”
But the Green New Deal isn’t just lousy policy. It’s incredibly hypocritical.
In boosting the plan, for instance, Ocasio-Cortez tweeted that “the world will end in 12 years if we don’t address climate change.” It was a hyperbolic summary of an alarmist and scientifically unsound United Nations report on greenhouse gas emissions.
Enter, the hypocrisy.
If a climate change-induced existential crisis were, indeed, just around the corner, the most rationale response would be to gin up all the nuclear power the world can get. After all, in 2017 nuclear provided more than half (56 percent) of the country’s emissions-free electricity — more than triple the amount we get from wind and 18 times more than solar generates generation.
But, according to the now-deleted FAQ sheet from Ocasio-Cortez’s office, “The Green New Deal makes new fossil fuel infrastructure or nuclear plants unnecessary.” Launching “a massive mobilization of all our resources into renewable energies,” while eliminating emissions-free nuclear power is the most inefficient and expensive approach to carbon reduction possible.
The hypocrisy doesn’t end there.
Green New Dealers are trying to sell their policies in the name of economic security and justice. However, policies that take away affordable, reliable power from American families are highly regressive. Higher energy costs hit low-income households hardest, because they spend a higher percentage of their budget on energy. The higher these costs climb, the more they are forced to make difficult choices between keeping the heat on or providing food for their family or perhaps going to the doctor.
Higher energy prices mean more than just having less money available for other necessities. It means having to spend more for all of the goods and services you purchase. That’s because energy is a critical component of manufacturing, communications and transportation—all of which are involved in getting goods and services to your household.
The Green New Deal doesn’t lead to more economic security and justice. It leads to greater economic strain, with low-income families being stressed the most.
And where’s the justice in cronyism and corporate welfare. The Green New Deal would open the floodgates of both.
Ocasio-Cortez rightly blasted New York’s special tax breaks for Amazon’s proposed HQ2. Offering up billions in state and city special tax breaks left a sour taste in many peoples’ mouths.
Cronyism works for big companies because they can offer a lot: investment, jobs and prosperity. But it is not a strategy for long-term economic success because it comes at the expense of other investments and opportunities. The investments will come when there’s an attractive, level-playing field for all companies to compete.
The Green New Deal would introduce significantly higher level of cronyism because Ocasio-Cortez wants the federal government (i.e., American taxpayers) to pay for the whole thing.
Remember Solyndra, the half-billion dollar solar boondoggle that went belly up? That’s just a small taste of things to come under a Green New Deal that puts potentially trillions of dollars up for grabs. As was the case with Solyndra, when the feds start picking energy technologies and companies to fund, they are essentially gambling with other peoples’ money. And there is never a guarantee the bet will pay off.
Solyndra is merely one example of a failed company that could not survive even with the federal government’s help. And there are many other examples of green cronyism that even more closely parallel New York’s erstwhile deal with Amazon, which Ocasio-Cortez found so distasteful. Taxpayers gave money or government-backed loans to companies that already enjoyed large market capitalization and/or substantial private investors. Federal “investment” wasn’t needed. But, hey, who’s gonna turn down free money?
The economic pain of green cronyism cuts deeper than wasted taxpayer money. When Washington steers money to — or away from — “favored” businesses or technologies, private-sector investment follow. This not only stifles competition and innovation, it also centralizes control in the hands of politicians, elites and lobbyists.
That’s the big picture. But the Green New Deal has very personal ramifications as well. It would change the way you live your life — from what car you drive, to how cool or warm you you’re your home, to what you eat.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- Top House investigators are demanding that the White House turn over documents related to its security clearances process by Monday, an escalation of the years-long fight between congressional Democrats and the Trump administration that could lead to subpoenas in the coming days.

The move follows an explosive report that President Donald Trump interceded to give his son-in-law Jared Kushner a top-secret security clearance despite concerns from top intelligence officials. The president directed his then-chief of staff, John Kelly, to approve the application -- a move Kelly, who had expressed concerns about the entire process, later detailed in a memo.

House Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings, D-Md., in a letter to the White House on Friday, urged "full and immediate compliance" with outstanding requests the panel had made related to security clearances for much of the past two years.

"I am now writing a final time to request your voluntary cooperation with this investigation," Cummings said in the letter to White House counsel Pat Cipollone.

While Cummings did not use the word subpoena in his letter, his recent correspondence with the White House suggested he is open to one: Cummings told the White House in early February to let the committee know "whether you intend to comply voluntarily or whether the committee should consider alternative means to obtain this information."

The White House still has not given the panel documents, arguing instead that the president traditionally has broad authority over his executive staff and clearance matters.

Cummings' frustration with the lack of response was clear in his Friday letter.

"Since I sent my letter on January 23, I have been negotiating in good faith -- and in private -- to try to obtain the information the Committee needs to conduct its investigation," Cummings wrote on Friday. "However, over the past five weeks, the White House has stalled, equivocated, and failed to produce a single document or witness to the Committee."

Cummings' Friday letter cited reports that Kushner, a senior White House adviser, and his wife, Ivanka Trump, pressured the president to grant Kushner a long-delayed clearance and that Trump instructed Kelly to fix the problem early last year. Trump's push to get Kushner clearance -- and the chief of staff's concerns about it -- was first reported by the New York Times, which also reported that then-White House Counsel Donald McGahn had concerns about Kushner's clearance. The Washington Post later reported on Trump's actions.

Both Trump and his daughter Ivanka Trump have publicly denied the president was involved in securing a clearance for Kushner. The president told The New York Times in a Jan. 31 interview that he did not direct Kelly or similar officials to grant a clearance for his son-in-law, and Ivanka Trump told ABC News earlier this month that her father was not involved in the process.

In the first year of the administration, Kushner held an interim security clearance that allowed him to view both top-secret and sensitive compartmented information, which is classified intelligence related to sensitive sources. With that designation, he has been able to attend classified briefings, get access to the president's daily intelligence report and issue requests for information to the intelligence community.

But there was widespread concern in the White House about Kushner's lack of a permanent clearance. Indeed, Democrats on Capitol Hill are also now questioning why Kushner had such trouble attaining that status.

"These new reports raise grave questions about what derogatory information career officials obtained about Mr. Kushner to recommend denying him access to our nation's most sensitive secrets, why President Trump concealed his role in overruling that recommendation, and why General Kelly and Mr. McGahn both felt compelled to document these actions, and why your office is continuing to withhold key documents and witnesses from this committee," Cummings wrote Friday.

The White House security clearance process has been a major focus for Oversight Committee Democrats over the past two years. Cummings even garnered bipartisan support for his bid to investigate the matter in the wake of reports that Rob Porter, a former White House aide who had been accused of beating his ex-wife, had been denied a clearance but still worked in a top position.

At the time, Republicans controlled the House, and then-Chairman Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., joined Cummings in requesting more information about the process. When the White House ignored the requests, however, Gowdy refused Cummings' pleas to subpoena the information.

Now, with Democrats in charge of the House -- and Cummings wielding expansive subpoena authority -- the White House won't be able to ignore Congress's questions without the potential for an adverse response. Already, there has been an intense back-and-forth between the panel and the White House, as Cummings relaunches his own security clearance investigation and increases the pressure on the administration for answers.

In his Jan. 23 letter to Cipollone, the lawmaker asked for a series of documents to be handed over to the panel, including the policies governing how the White House grants security clearances and any recent changes made to the policy, particularly those to give classified information to people convicted of crimes or under investigation by law enforcement.

The panel also asked for all communications between Trump's transition team regarding background investigations, clearance applications and the outcomes for nearly 10 top officials they wanted to hone in on. That list includes Kushner as well as national security adviser John Bolton, his predecessor Michael Flynn and his son, and Sebastian Gorka.

But the White House has pushed back on the Oversight request, arguing that authority over the security clearance application process pales in comparison to the president's.

"Congress, as well as the federal courts, have long recognized that the president enjoys broad discretion in selecting, and communicating with, his immediate advisers," Cipollone wrote to Cummings on Jan. 31. "In view of the president's paramount constitutional authority in these areas, congressional action must necessarily be circumscribed."

Texto completo: Julia Roberts could be returning to Amazon.
Variety has confirmed that the "Homecoming" star is currently in talks to star in and executive produce a limited series based on the book "Charlotte Walsh Likes to Win" by Jo Piazza at the streaming service.
The book follows Walsh, a candidate in the most hotly-contested midterm Senate race in America. A former Silicon Valley executive, Walsh and her family return to her downtrodden Pennsylvania hometown to run for office, but she is unprepared for just how dirty her opponent, her peers, and the media are willing to get.
Jon Robin Baitz will write the series adaptation and executive produce. Roberts will executive produce under her Red Om banner along with Lisa Gillan and Marisa Gill.
News of the new potential TV starring vehicle for Roberts comes after she starred in Season 1 of Amazon's "Homecoming," based on the podcast of the same name.
The Oscar-winning actress will remain on the show as an executive producer, however. "Homecoming" was picked up for two seasons when it was initially ordered at Amazon, but Roberts only had a one-year deal to star. The role marked the first series regular role of Roberts' career.

Texto completo: Local leaders on Friday said they support efforts to win back Amazon's second headquarters for Queens, but said Long Island needs to move on with plans for business development and housing projects that had been tied to the online retailer's now-scuttled plans.
"There is a movement afoot to lure them back," Nassau County Executive Laura Curran said, referring to a public pitch to Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos by top business, labor and nonprofit officials in the metropolitan area.
"I truly hope that it is successful," she said. "But in the meantime...we can see that Amazon was one, a big one, but one of the many regional economic development opportunities for Nassau County."
Curran told about 130 people gathered for a development conference at Hofstra University in Hempstead that her administration will continue to support housing projects near Long Island Rail Road stations, which would have housed people working at the proposed Amazon HQ2 facility in Long Island City, Queens.
Curran and others said the availability of housing, particularly apartments, condominiums and co-ops, is crucial to keeping young workers on the Island and in turn providing a skilled workforce for businesses.
Stuart Rabinowitz, Hofstra University president, said he was doubtful Amazon would resurrect HQ2, noting "in my opinion, very sadly, unless we have a very good reconciliation, that's not going to happen.
"We have to move on from there," he said. "Just because that didn't work out, it doesn't mean we shouldn't continue to pursue bold ideas now and in the future."
Rabinowitz, co-vice chairman of the Long Island Regional Economic Development Council, said Friday's conference was planned before Amazon's Valentine's Day announcement that it would not bring 25,000 jobs to Queens after all. The company has blamed its pullout on opposition from some Queens politicians and liberal activists.
Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio also have blamed Queens opponents and said they wished Amazon had fought harder for the project, which would have received nearly $3 billion in tax breaks in return for $27.5 billion in tax payments over 25 years.
Friday, in an advertisement in The New York Times, 80 civic leaders publicly asked Amazon to reconsider. Cuomo "will take personal responsibility for the project's state approval," the "open letter" states.
The only signer from Long Island is Kevin Law, president of the Long Island Association business group.
 Cuomo, in a Friday interview on radio station WNYC, said the effort is a long shot. "I don't believe they will reconsider, but I am hopeful. They have given no indication that they would reconsider."
An Amazon spokesman said Friday the company had no comment.
: Peter Goldsmith, chairman of LISTnet, a regional technology advocacy group, applauded efforts to get the company to reverse its decision.
 "This really would have made our whole area a better competitor to Silicon Valley," he said.

Texto completo: The Food and Drug Administration on Thursday said a major Canadian drug distributor was selling unapproved and mislabeled medicines to unsuspecting Americans looking to save money on prescriptions, and warned it to stop.
The company, CanaRx, sells many common prescription medicines at a lower cost to hundreds of public and private employer programs in the United States. Many of its buyers are city and county governments seeking to save money, among them: Albany, N.Y. and Duluth, Minn. CanaRx says the medications it sells are high-quality, from Canada, Australia and Britain, but the F.D.A. said this is not always the case.
"Operations like CanaRx use their names to imply that patients are receiving medicines approved in Canada, when it's likely that some of those drugs are from other countries with lax standards," Dr. Scott Gottlieb, the F.D.A. commissioner, said in an interview. "Such operations take advantage of unsuspecting Americans, by purporting to distribute safe and effective imported drugs, at least some of which are instead expired, mislabeled, subject to recalls or potentially counterfeit."
A statement posted on the agency's website urged consumers not to use any medicines obtained from CanaRx.
Joseph Morris, general counsel for CanaRx, said in an interview: "Every prescription that is dispensed through a CanaRx program is dispensed directly to the patient from a licensed, regulated, brick-and-mortar pharmacy in Canada, Britain, or Australia, and the patient can be sure that medicine she receives is the medicine that her doctor ordered."
The F.D.A. did not present any evidence that the CanaRx drugs came from countries other than those it advertised, but said its investigation was ongoing.
The F.D.A.'s action comes at a time of renewed political attention to drug importation as an alternative for Americans facing expensive prescription medicines at home. Senator Bernie Sanders, the Vermont Independent running for president, and House Democrats Elijah Cummings of Maryland and Ro Khanna of California, have introduced bills that would allow patients, pharmacists and wholesalers to import medicine from Canada and other countries and would peg the price of prescription drugs in the United States to the median price in Canada, Britain, France, Germany and Japan.
Some states are also moving to take action. In Florida, Governor Ron DeSantis recently proposed importing Canadian drugs to his state to save money. Vermont last year enacted a prescription-drug importation law, although it has not yet gone into effect.
Federal law bars importing unapproved prescription drugs into the United States, although millions of Americans do so. The Department of Health and Human Services has the power to approve specific programs permitting drugs from Canada to enter the country, but so far has not done so, the agency said.
In answer to a question at a congressional hearing on Wednesday, Dr. Gottlieb said he was certain that prescriptions sold by Canadian pharmacies were safe, but not that online websites claiming to have bought their drugs in Canada really had done so.
Dr. Gottlieb said he was especially concerned about CanaRx's sale of drugs with special safety requirements because they were high-risk and needed to be carefully managed to protect vulnerable patients. Among the drugs the agency's warning letter cited were Tracleer, a prescription medicine for patients with certain types of pulmonary arterial hypertension -- high blood pressure in the vessels of the lungs -- and CellCept, prescribed for people who have received a kidney, heart or liver transplant.
"CanaRx is causing important safety measures that are put in place for the FDA-approved versions of these drugs to be bypassed," the warning letter said.
Mr. Morris, the CanaRx lawyer, said the company would cooperate with the F.D.A. He added that he thought the agency might have confused some websites that advertised or sold imported drugs with CanaRx. "Many of the websites listed in the F.D.A. letter belong to other entities completely unconnected to CanaRx," he said.
In an email to The New York Times, Mr. Morris wrote that 123 of the websites listed were active CanaRx websites; 27 were CanaRx programs that were terminated, and 15 were not affiliated with the company. An F.D.A. spokesman said the agency stood by its findings.
CanaRx has become popular over the past 15 years with many employers in the United States. Mr. Morris said the company serves as a broker between the companies' employees and pharmacies and physicians in Canada, Australia or Britain. The consumer sends a prescription to CanaRx, which then finds a foreign doctor to reissue it, and have it filled locally, he said. The drug is then sent to the American consumer.
"The cost savings are often very great, which benefits the individual consumer and their plan sponsors," Mr. Morris said.
The warning letter requested that CanaRx immediately stop selling unapproved new drugs from foreign sources to American buyers. It noted that CanaRx's disclaimer told consumers that their medicine may have appeared to be different in size, shape or color than what the consumer had bought in the United States.
"Having this disclaimer in each invoice demonstrates that CanaRx has designed its business to operate in a manner that substitutes the F.D.A.-approved drugs prescribed by the U.S. health care provider with unapproved drugs," the F.D.A. wrote.

Texto completo: A University of Florida horticulture professor known for his scientific defense of genetically modified foods lost his defamation suit against journalist Eric Lipton and the New York Times for describing his close relationships with biotech giants including Monsanto.
Chief U.S. Judge Mark E. Walker of the Northern District of Florida in Tallahassee Wednesday granted the motion for summary judgment filed by Lipton and the Times and directed the clerk of courts to file it dismissed with prejudice. No hearing was held.
Summary judgment is appropriately granted when "the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law," Walker said.
In his ruling, Walker reaffirmed Florida's "fair report" privilege for journalists and the state's public records laws.
The professor, Kevin Folta, said he had no comment at this time.
"We are pleased with the Court's decision," said Mark Caramanica of the Thomas and LoCicero law firm that represented Lipton and the Times. "This is a case that should have never been brought, over an important story based on Dr. Folta's own communications that shed light on public academics' relationships with the food industry."
Barbara Petersen, President of the First Amendment Foundation, lauded the decision as a big win for open government.
"Ostensibly, it's a defamation case, but the court's language on the public records law is hugely important and reinforces the public's right of access and solidifies the importance of oversight and accountability," Petersen said. "The arguments raised by Professor Folta are are typical of agency arguments used too frequently to frustrate access to basic email records and the Court saw through those arguments."
In his lawsuit filed in October 2017, Folta claimed that Lipton and the Times "manipulated an interview" to advance their own "anti-GMO agenda" by making him appear to be a "covertly paid operative of one of the largest and controversial companies in America, Monsanto."
To further their "subjective agenda," Folta claimed, the defendants placed a lengthy article above the fold in the Sunday Sept. 6, 2015 New York Times, "the day after posting this scandalous article on the New York Times' website, with false and misleading headlines and bylines, to draw readers into the manifestly false and misleading content."
The defendants said the article purported to document how both biotech and organics companies cultivated relationships with public university professors. The article relied on interviews and public records, including emails between Folta and executives with Monsanto and other biotech companies.
The Times and Lipton said statements in the article were true, were not "of and concerning" Folta, were not susceptible to a defamatory meaning, protected under the fair report privilege or as pure opinion and barred by the applicable statute of limitations.
Lipton and The Times noted that all but one of the 32 statements cited in the defamation suit were protected by Florida's fair report privilege, which allows journalists "to report accurately on information received from government officials."
Folta argued his emails weren't public records, but Walker said they clearly are as defined by Florida's public records law.
Walker elaborated in great detail his analysis of the statements as related to the fair report privilege, which is broad and only requires that statements be "substantially" correct in presentation of the information received. It doesn't have to be exact in every detail or conform to technical and scientific writings.
"Protection of the privilege is not lost, for example, by colorful language or a failure to look beyond the government documents for verification," Walker wrote. "Editorial style is expected, and news media can phrase their coverage to 'catch . . . the readership's attention.'"
In his ruling, Walker expressed sympathy toward Folta in his attempt to protect his reputation as an independent, impartial scientist in seeking a narrow interpretation of the state's public record law and fair report doctrine.
"This case is not one cooked up by billionaire opponents of a free media. Plaintiff seeks only a remedy for the reputational damage he alleges he suffered because of Defendants' publication," Walker wrote.
"A cramped reading of the privilege would undercut its very purpose. It would open the door to far less meritorious suits by far less scrupulous plaintiffs, and it would contribute to the ongoing chipping-away of the rights and privileges necessary to the press's ability to play its intended role as government watchdog," the judge added. "This Court will not do so."

REPUBLICAN LAWMAKERS ASK DOJ TO INVESTIGATE COHEN FOR PERJURY

Texto completo: Two of President Donald Trump's closest allies on the House Judiciary Committee referred Mr. Trump's former personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, to the Justice Department on Thursday for possible criminal prosecution, claiming to have evidence that Cohen "committed perjury and knowingly made false statements" to lawmakers during his daylong testimony Wednesday.
That development came as Cohen completed three days of testimony on Capitol Hill - and was set to come back for another day next week - after publicly branding his former boss a racist and a con man who lied about business dealings in Russia and directed him to conceal extramarital relationships.
The criminal referral - sent by Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, the top Republican on the Oversight Committee, and North Carolina Republican Rep. Mark Meadows - outlined several areas of testimony they urged the Justice Department to investigate, including Cohen's claims Wednesday that he did not seek a job in the Trump White House, his denial of committing bank fraud, as well as his assertion that the did not have any reportable contracts with foreign entities.
"I was extremely proud to be the personal attorney for the president of the United States of America," Cohen told lawmakers Wednesday. "I did not want to go to the White House."
Yet Republicans have pointed to court filings from prosecutors in the Southern District of New York that stated Cohen "privately told friends and colleagues, including in seized text messages, that he expected to be given a prominent role and title in the new administration" - an assertion Cohen said Wednesday was "inaccurate."
"Mr. Cohen's testimony is material to the Committee's assessment of Mr. Cohen's motive to monetize his former association with President Trump," Mr. Jordan and Mr. Meadows wrote to the Justice Department on Thursday. "It is essential that the Department of Justice investigate these remarkable contradictions between Mr. Cohen, the SDNY prosecutors, and the public accounts of witnesses with firsthand information."
A spokesperson for the Justice Department said it is reviewing the referral.
Lanny Davis, Cohen's attorney, called it "a sad misuse of the criminal justice system with the aura of pure partisanship."
Cohen's testimony unfolded as Mr. Trump was in Vietnam meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Mr. Trump said he tried to watch as much of Cohen's marathon hearing as he could but called the hearing "fake" and said it was a "terrible thing" for Democrats to hold it during his summit.
He seized on Cohen's concession that he had no direct evidence that Mr. Trump or his aides colluded with Russia to get him elected, the primary question underpinning special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation. Mr. Trump said he was a "little impressed" that Cohen had said that to the House Oversight and Reform Committee.
Meanwhile, some Democrats have suggested that the claim Cohen perjured himself is misguided.
House Oversight Chairman Elijah Cummings, D-Md., told reporters he believes Cohen's claim he didn't want to work at the White House.
Sources have told CNN, however, that Cohen was angling for a job in the White House, but was sidelined by members of Mr. Trump's family.
One person described Cohen as having become "disenfranchised" in the early months of the Trump administration -but that he nevertheless continued to portray himself as Mr. Trump's go-to guy.
The president also suggested Cohen join the White House counsel's office, but former White House counsel Don McGahn said Cohen didn't have the necessary experience and background to work there, and Mr. Trump dropped it.
Mr. Jordan and Mr. Meadows also claim that Cohen's testimony that he "never defrauded any bank" was "intentionally false" given that Manhattan prosecutors "specifically referred to Mr. Cohen's crimes of making false statements to financial institutions as 'bank fraud'" in a footnote of his plea agreement.
Cohen pleaded guilty to making false statements to a financial institution, however, not bank fraud, and prosecutors have not alleged that any bank lost money.
The GOP lawmakers additionally accused Cohen of lying about his contacts with foreign entities, a point highlighted by Mr. Meadows at Wednesday's hearing. Cohen said he would review the form and amend it if necessary.
Cohen on Wednesday became the first Trump insider to pull back the curtain on a version of the inner workings of Mr. Trump's political and business operations. He likened the president to a "mobster" who demanded blind loyalty from underlings and expected them to lie on his behalf.
He said Mr. Trump knew in advance that damaging emails about Democrat Hillary Clinton would be released during the 2016 campaign - a claim the president has denied - and accused Mr. Trump of lying during the 2016 campaign about a Moscow real estate protect.
Cohen also said Mr. Trump directed him during the campaign to arrange a hush money payment to a porn actress who said she had sex with the president a decade earlier. He said Mr. Trump arranged to reimburse Cohen, and Cohen brought to the hearing a check from the president's personal bank account that he said was proof of the transaction.

Texto completo: Two food writers are giving the adage "a woman's place is in the kitchen" a feminist twist.
Co-authored by Life & Thyme's Stef Ferrari and Deepi Ahluwalia, "A Woman's Place: The Inventors, Rumrunners, Lawbreakers, Scientists, and Single Moms Who Changed the World with Food," out March 5, is an anthology on female culinary innovations, with profiles of women from various backgrounds and time periods.
amNewYork spoke to Ferrari, who lives in Cobble Hill, about six whose stories connect to NYC.
Pauline Morton Sabin (1887-1955), socialite involved in repealing Prohibition
"I think there's this notion that, across the board, all women supported and advocated for Prohibition. But Pauline's story is fascinating because she saw it as ineffective and ultimately argued that it caused greater problems by creating opportunities and motivation for criminal behavior. Pauline rallied more than a million women who shared that belief and worked toward Prohibition reform."
Esther Eng (1914-1970), film director and restaurateur
"She was a daughter of Chinese immigrants in San Francisco. She took up filmmaking and moved to New York and recognized that a lot of the Chinese actors that she had been working with were struggling financially. She opened a restaurant almost as a platform to give them a place to work and hone their English, so that when they went to acting gigs they could communicate better. She wound up opening several restaurants in New York. Esther lived openly as a lesbian as well. She faced quite a lot of adversity in her day, and her legacy is one of inclusivity, empathy and, of course, food!"
Edna Lewis (1916-2006), chef at Café Nicholson and Gage and Tollner
"Edna's influence simply can't be overstated. She showed people the scope of Southern cuisine beyond the stereotypical 'soul food' - though you could hardly imagine saying her food was without soul! She was far ahead of her time in demonstrating that restaurant meals could focus on fresh and seasonal cooking. Her work helped make Café Nicholson legendary. It was a hangout for Tennessee Williams, Capote, Brando, Garbo, Dietrich - you name it. They all came for her food."
Judith Jones (1924-2017), Alfred A. Knopf editor who oversaw cookbooks by the likes of Julia Child and Edna Lewis
"She was such a visionary when it came to identifying these powerful voices in food. She was such a champion, and as an editor, she helped find, support and propel these women to the culinary world's stage. It's because of Judith that we have some of the most important cookbooks of our time - not to mention a window into other worlds and cultures through their cuisine."
Dorothy Cann Hamilton (1949-2016), founder of the International Culinary Center
"Dorothy was a woman who knew the one thing all great entrepreneurs must know: how to identify and fill a need. After she traveled to France, she recognized that American culinary schools couldn't hold a candle to what she'd seen abroad. Because of her decision to come back and launch the French Culinary Institute in NYC (now the International Culinary Center), we have some of our most famous chefs - including New York icons like Christina Tosi and Bobby Flay."
Ruth Reichl, 71, James Beard Award-winning food writer and NYC native
"Ruth showed up at a time when food books and magazines were almost exclusively about recipes. She showed the humanity behind food, and really helped create modern food journalism, by demonstrating through her work at Gourmet as well as her time at The New York Times, that there were real stories and lessons to be learned about people and culture from the food world."

It’s time to add 'Mx.' into the daily mix of titles we use to address each other

Resumen: Only in the past few years, as gender nonconforming, nonbinary or transgender people come out, has Mx. gained ground as a gender-neutral honorific.

Texto completo: Maddie Luebbert teaches 9th grade English in a Philadelphia public school and, according to a recent NBC News report, is much admired by the students. As in most public schools, the teachers use “Mr. ” or “Ms. ” (and sometimes, “Mrs. ”) as their title when addressed by students. Luebbert, 25, prefers “Mx. ” (pronounced “mix”), a gender-neutral alternative to the usual titles. Luebbert herself identifies as “nonbinary” — which is to say neither male nor female.
Say what? Mx.
Most Americans haven’t come across this title yet, likely for two reasons. Other than teachers, doctors, professors and members of the clergy, we generally don’t use courtesy titles — or what are also known as honorifics — anymore. The second reason: It’s only in the past handful of years in this country that as more people who identify as gender nonconforming, nonbinary or transgender come out, Mx. has gained some currency as the gender-neutral cousin to Ms.
Read more commentary:
High school could have been hell for my transgender son. Don't make it hell for the next kid.
We need to be counted. New CDC data help drive transgender visibility.
Hormones, surgery, regret: I was a transgender woman for 8 years — time I can't get back
But it’s time to add Mx. into the daily mix of titles we use. In considering the addition of Mx. to the OxfordDictionaries. com, published by the venerable Oxford English Dictionary, its assistant editor explained in the London Times, “This is an example of how the English language adapts to people’s needs, with people using language in ways that suit them rather than letting language dictate identity to them. ”
'Ms. ' sets a good precedent
Here’s how the Oxford Dictionaries defines Mx. : “A title used before a person's surname or full name by those who wish to avoid specifying their gender or by those who prefer not to identify themselves as male or female. ”
Mx. used in a sentence: “The bank is planning to introduce the honorific ‘Mx. ’ as an alternative for anyone who feels that they don’t, for reasons of undetermined gender, fit into being either a Mr. , Mrs. , Miss or a Ms. ”
Not buying it?
Think about how Ms. came to be the marital-status-neutral alternative to Miss or Mrs. Before being introduced, many women, especially those in the workplace, didn’t want their title to disclose whether they were married. Whose business was that — especially because men were called Mr. whether or not they had been hitched. Any dispassionate observer would have seen the long debate over Ms. for what it was: an unfair, double standard. Nonetheless, it wasn't until 1986, three-quarters of a century after it was first noted, that The New York Times finally recognized Ms. as an alternative to Mrs. or Miss.
Mx. puts gender expectations aside
At first, I didn’t honestly understand the importance of Mx. Jacob Tobia, who identifies as transgender and is the author of the forthcoming memoir "Sissy: A Coming of Gender Story," explained to me:
“I use Mx. because it helps me avoid the unfair gender expectations that come with choosing Mr. or Ms. When people see ‘Mr. Tobia’ on a nametag, they're expecting a masculine man to walk through the door; however, when the nametag says, "Mx. Tobia," they have to put their expectations aside and simply respect me for who I am. Having a title that reflects my identity helps make the world more empathetic and easier to navigate. ”
When I asked Tobia how often this conundrum presents itself, the trans activist explained:
"One of the biggest areas where this comes up is in paperwork. Sure, everyone hates paperwork, but for gender nonconforming and nonbinary folks like me, it's excruciating on a whole other level. Having to choose between "man" or "woman" — or "Mr. " or "Ms. " — on a form sets nonbinary people up to fail and enables greater discrimination against us. All forms should include third gender options that allow people like me to accurately describe our identities. "
Businesses, everyone should get on board
Agreed. I remember not only five years ago — before marriage equality became the law in this country — most forms didn’t include the option of “partnered” — for those like me who were in a committed relationship but not allowed to marry. It felt as though my relationship didn’t exist — wasn’t sanctioned.
So, when do you use Mx. ? For starters, when someone asks you to, like Maddie Luebbert, the nonbinary teacher in Texas. To conjure up Aretha Franklin, that’s R-E-S-P-E-C-T. Companies that ask their customers to choose a title — Ms. , Miss, Mr. , Rev. , Dr. — would be wise to include Mx. as well. That’s good business.
Some advocates argue that everyone should use Mx. — regardless of their gender identity — but one step at a time.
Of course, we could get rid of titles altogether, but in an era marked by hateful name-calling from none more so than the current president, now’s not the time to jettison any form of courtesy.

The American Dream remains deferred for Black millennials

Texto completo: The American Dream is described as a national ethos: a set of ideals in which freedom includes the opportunity for prosperity and success, and upward social mobility for the family and children, achieved through hard work in a society with few barriers.
That's the Wikipedia definition.
For African American millennials, the dream remains deferred - and in some cases, is a nightmare.
"The American Dream, the idea that anyone can succeed through hard work, is one of the most enduring myths in this country. And one of its most prominent falsehoods," Reniqua Allen, the author of "It Was All a Dream" wrote in a recent New York Times Op-Ed.
"As I entered my 30s, still navigating what achieving the dream would mean, I wondered what other Black millennials were feeling. I wanted to figure out what my generation of Black Americans thought about the promise of the American dream and how we can attain it," Allen said.
Keli Hammond, the owner and CEO of Washington, D.C.-based B Classic Marketing & Communications and author of "Craved: the Secret Sauce to Building a Highly-Successful, Standout Brand," said Black millennials have an uphill climb to achieve the American Dream.
"Unfortunately, this is a very true reality. Race is a touchy subject in this country - always has been, always will be," Hammond said.
"It's funny because, even thought it's part of our social construct, it's still incredibly uncomfortable when it's talked about."
Hammond, who holds a bachelor's degree in Advertising from Temple University and a certification in Change Leadership from Cornell University, noted that race has a way of humbling dreams quite fast.
"Although I believe that millennials in general are struggling to identify with the American Dream, for Black millennials it can often feel* like a dream you can't achieve," she said.
"We weren't afforded the same job opportunities or raises, we don't have the same networks, we're not given the same leeway if we make a mistake, and we don't have the same access to capital or generational wealth - it's hard every day," Hammond said.
In a survey customized exclusively for NNPA Newswire, Branded Research asked 452 African Americans which aspect of the American Dream is most important.
A total of 30 percent said having a comfortable retirement; 21 percent said homeownership; 21 percent said setting up their children for success; 15 percent said owing a business; 7 percent said a college education; and 6 percent said having a nuclear family.
When broken down by gender, 22 percent of men and 34 percent of women said having a comfortable retirement was most important.
Twenty-two percent of men identified homeownership as most important as compared with 21 percent of women.
When broken down by age, 24 percent of those between 18 and 24 identified setting up their children for success was most important and 21 percent of the same age group said having a comfortable retirement and owning a business is paramount.
Twenty-eight percent of African Americans between 25 and 34 identified home ownership as most important followed by setting up their children for success (27 percent); and having a comfortable retirement (19 percent).
Overall, African American consumers are most likely to say that the most important aspects of the American Dream are having a comfortable retirement, homeownership and setting children up for success.
African American women are more likely than African American men to say that having a comfortable retirement is the most important aspect of the American Dream.
Younger African Americans value homeownership, setting up children for success and owning a business while older African Americans value a comfortable retirement most.
"The American Dream isn't what I strive for [because] my goal is to be successful in my chosen creative path of singing and to travel the world doing that - not to be tethered to a job I don't like, to pay a mortgage I don't want in order to live permanently anywhere," said New York musician Risa Branch.
"I finally paid off my student loans. I want the freedom to be wherever I want to be," Branch said.
"If I did get the surplus funds to buy a house, I'd rent it out and use the investment to fund a more mobile lifestyle."
Hammond argued that Black millennials want equality, opportunity and freedom. "We want the same business and home loans, we want the same job offers, we want the same -everything," she said.
"I'm college-educated, well-read, and well-traveled. I'm a business owner and a homeowner, and even with all of that, I'm keenly aware that I am still very much an underdog," Hammond continued.
"Freedom means you don't struggle financially or live paycheck-to-paycheck. Freedom means you're able to relax sometimes and not worry about all the ways that you have to work to dispel racial myths and stereotypes."
Sidebar "Although I believe that millennials in general are struggling to identify with the American Dream, for Black millennials it can often feel like a dream you can't achieve."

Texto completo: President Trump’s inaugural committee was subpoenaed by the attorney general for the District of Columbia, who is scrutinizing how the committee used the $107 million raised for the president’s inauguration and how it was spent.

According to the subpoena, Attorney General Karl Racine and his team are examining whether funds “were wasted, mismanaged, and/or improperly provided private benefit, causing the committee to exceed or abuse its authority or act contrary to its nonprofit purpose.”

The New York Times reports the subpoena also presses for documents detailing the involvement of Trump’s children Ivanka Trump, Donald Trump Jr., and Eric Trump with the committee.

It also seeks information concerning payments to the Trump Organization or the Trump International Hotel, such as documents addressing the “pricing of venue rentals.” The Trump International Hotel received $1.5 million from the committee for rooms and other things.

Similarly, it requests information on whether any committee official or officials business received any payments, and whether any committee officials has financial interest in any vendor agreements.

A spokesman for the committee told the Times it was in was in contact with Racine’s team. A spokesman for Racine declined to comment on the matter.

The Trump inauguration committee has received subpoena requests from two other governmental authorities, as D.C. joins federal prosecutors in Manhattan who are evaluating if foreigners illegally donated to the committee, and New Jersey’s attorney general who appears to be investigating if the committee followed civil statues stipulating how the nonprofit organization fundraises.

Texto completo: President Trump's former lawyer, Michael Cohen, was grilled by a panel of US House representatives on Wednesday, with Massachusetts Democrats Ayanna Pressley and Stephen Lynch getting their fair share of hits in, and Boston University graduate Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez raising questions about Trump's tax returns.
Speaking toward the first half of the Cohen hearing, Lynch fired back at GOP congressmen who were calling the former Trump attorney a liar.
Lynch shot back while addressing Cohen, saying committee Republicans "aren't afraid you're going to lie. I think they're afraid you're going to tell the truth."
He also listed the names of Trump associates who have pleaded guilty to various crimes, saying Republicans “for two years. . . refused to bring any of these people up before the committee."
“Your side ran away from the truth. And we're trying to bring it to the American people," Lynch said.
When Pressley got her chance to speak, she took on the Trump Foundation, which she said was abused like a personal piggy bank.
During the line of questioning, Cohen confirmed he arranged in 2013 for a straw bidder to buy for $60,000 a portrait of Trump by artist William Quigley, an anecdote he also relayed in his opening remarks.
“Why would the president want to bid up the price for something he was ultimately paying for?" Pressley asked.
“It was all about ego," Cohen said, noting the portrait was paid for by a check from the trust. “He tasked me to find a straw bidder, to ensure his painting, which was going last in the auction, would go for the highest amount of any of the paintings that had been put on the auction block for the day."
Cohen said he believes the painting is currently hanging in one of Trump's clubs.
The punchiest line of Pressley's questioning came in the last 30 seconds of her time, in which she asked Cohen a pointed question.
“Would you agree that someone could deny rental units to African-Americans, lead the birther movement, refer to the diaspora as 's-hole countries,' and refer to white supremacists as 'fine people,' have a black friend and still be racist?"
“Yes," Cohen replied.
“I agree," Pressley said.

Ocasio-Cortez used her time to question Cohen about how Trump dodged taxes, potentially laying the groundwork for the committee to seek the president's tax returns.
Asking about providing inflated assets to insurance companies, Ocasio-Cortez said to Cohen, “Where would the committee find more information on this? Do you think we'd need to review his financial statements and his tax returns in order to compare them?"
“Yes, and you'd find it at the Trump Org," Cohen said.

Bringing up reports of Trump devaluing assets to pay lower taxes, Ocasio-Cortez asked: “To your knowledge, was the president interested in reducing his local real estate tax bills?"
“Yes," Cohen responded.
“And how did he do that?" Ocasio-Cortez followed up.
“What you do is you deflate the value of the asset, and then you put in the request for the tax department for a deduction," Cohen said.
Referring to a New York Times article that alleges Trump engaged in suspect tax schemes, Ocasio-Cortez asked if it would be helpful for the committee to “obtain federal and state tax returns from the president and his company to address that discrepancy?"
“I believe so," Cohen responded.

Falling tax refunds highlight Republican scam

Texto completo: Last week, Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, chair of the Senate's Finance Committee, and Rep. Kevin Brady, R-Tex., the ranking Republican on the House Ways and Means Committee, penned a commentary in USA Today telling Americans they've got it all wrong when it comes to the Republican tax reform and their own personal finances.
If you received a surprisingly small tax refund for 2018, don't you worry. You received the money last year, when you got paid. "Since many workers and their families live paycheck-to-paycheck, getting at least some of their tax cut in advance rather than delaying it a year is a life saver, they wrote. Besides, they added, "You get to control your money. Not the IRS.
Note to Republicans: When you need to scold Americans on how they handle their money, you lose, even if you've got a point. Tax refunds are down more than $5 billion from this time last year, according to an analysis performed by Investor's Business Daily. People are squawking - on Instagram, on Twitter and/or to any reporter who will listen to them. Republicans assumed Americans would become converts when they saw they were getting a slightly bigger paycheck, after withholding tables were recalculated in early 2018. They assumed wrong.
First, most people never noticed they were receiving more money in their regular take-home paycheck. This isn't because they like or dislike President Donald Trump. It's because there's plenty of evidence that small tax cuts - the typical middle-income filer received a break of less than $20 a week - often go unnoticed.
The same thing happened when Barack Obama enacted a temporary tax cut early in his presidency. According to a New York Times-CBS News poll conducted in 2010, more than a year after Americans should have been seeing an increase in take-home pay, a solid majority of people had no clue they'd received a tax rollback. More people, in fact, thought their taxes had increased than decreased.
Second, taking a tax refund is not a financially optimal decision, and one many personal-finance gurus howl about every year, but people like it. The reason for that is rooted in human psychology. Tax refunds work as a form of forced savings for many people, a way of making themselves put money aside for post-holiday bills, vacations or a household repair. Yes, they could set up a savings strategy themselves, but that would leave it there, forever available to spend on a passing fancy or immediate need.
More relevant: Many people don't get around to setting aside dollars in the first place. They spend their money as it comes in. As a result, they rely on their tax refund. They would, apparently, prefer to receive something like a lump sum of $2,135, the average tax refund received in 2018 for a 2017 return. (About 75 percent of all filers received refunds in recent years.) Real estate - if you don't take the money out in the form of a second mortgage or refinancing - works in a similar fashion. It's an expensive savings vehicle, but it's a savings strategy nonetheless, something that accounts for the fact that for many Americans, their home is their main source of wealth.
This behavior around tax refunds, contra congressional Republicans, is not a surrender of control. It's knowing your weaknesses and making them work for you. People plan on their refunds and react to them in unsurprising ways. According to the recent paper "Tax Refund Expectations and Financial Behavior, when low- and moderate-income filers receive the refund they expect, they use about 15 percent of it to pay down debt. An unexpected refund, on the hand, leads to increased spending and debt.
Finally, as millions of Americans grapple with their smaller-than-expected refunds, they are hearing more and more about the big winner of the tax-reform scam: corporate America. Amazon (whose founder, Jeff Bezos, is the owner of The Washington Post) owed zero corporate income tax last year. And as Axios reported earlier this week, General Motors, which made $11.8 billion in profit last year, filed for a refund of slightly more than $100 million.
There is no argument the Republicans can come up with to get around this reality. It's not just that getting into arguments with people about human nature is a loser's game. It's that the GOP tax scam was always designed to benefit one group and one group only - the richest and wealthiest among us.
Remember when Rep. Chris Collins , R-N.Y., claimed, "My donors are basically saying, get it done or don't ever call me again' ? It's why they pushed their reform effort as hard as they did. The refund imbroglio is bringing this point home to voters once again. Little wonder majorities of Americans say they support raising taxes on the highest earners and the wealthiest Americans. They know they've been had.

Summit could hold smaller prizes

Texto completo: As President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un hold a summit meeting this week in Vietnam, they have something in common: Each apparently looks in the mirror and sees a Nobel Peace Prize winner.
"If not for me, we would now be at War with North Korea!" Trump tweeted last summer. He seems to see his legacy in part as the great peacemaker of the Korean Peninsula and recently boasted that Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe had nominated him for the Nobel Peace Prize.
"Many other people feel that way, too," Trump told reporters, as he spoke about the "beautiful" letter that Abe had written to nominate him.
Abe, apparently mortified that his effort to stroke Trump had become public, refused to confirm this. And two leading Japanese newspapers, The Asahi Shimbun and The Yomiuri Shimbun, reported that Abe's letter was written at the White House's request.
In surprising symmetry, North Korea is said to be abuzz with talk about the Nobel Peace Prize and the possibility that it could be awarded to Kim. The Kims are generally overachievers: Kim is said to have started driving at age 3, and his father had five holes-in-one in his first game of golf, not to mention a perfect score of 300 the first time he bowled.
It is, of course, delusion to think that either Trump or Kim will win the Nobel Peace Prize, and in general it's not a good thing for leaders to go into a summit delusional. Many security officials in the United States and abroad worry that in his quest for the prize, Trump might make some rash pledge, such as to withdraw American forces from South Korea.
But delusions can be helpful if they make each side more willing to make concessions and pursue an arduous peace process. I don't think there is any prospect of North Korea handing over its nuclear weapons soon, but it is possible to see a diplomatic path that leaves the world safer - and there's a fighting chance that we might achieve this.
Last year, Trump was bamboozled at his first meeting with Kim. There were minimal preparations, and Trump made major concessions such as suspending military exercises in exchange for nothing as significant.
Trump compounded his diplomatic ineptitude with rhetorical grandiosity. He tweeted, "There is no longer a Nuclear Threat from North Korea," and he later asserted that Kim had sent him "beautiful letters" and "we fell in love."
In fact, the North Korean threat remained. Indeed, North Korea has apparently continued to produce nuclear fuel and operate its missile bases. American intelligence officials bluntly told a Senate committee this year that North Korea is unlikely to denuclearize.
Yet if Trump was hoodwinked last year, there are some more hopeful signs this time. He has appointed a well-respected special envoy, Stephen Biegun, and both Biegun and Trump have been signaling that they are now realistic about trade-offs and a timeline, with Trump saying that North Korea will denuclearize "ultimately" and that "I'm in no rush."
Here's what a plausible deal might look like.
North Korea would promise to dismantle its Yongbyon nuclear complex and a couple of less important sites, admit international inspectors and continue its moratorium on nuclear and missile tests. In exchange, the United States would relax sanctions on inter-Korean projects involving tourism and manufacturing. The two sides could also declare that the Korean War has ended, exchange diplomatic liaison offices, ease cultural exchanges and agree on a path forward chipping away at the nuclear program.
In some sense, this is Kabuki. On my last visit to North Korea, in 2017, officials spoke of learning from Libya that if you give up your nuclear program, America may then topple your government. So I suspect Kim has zero plans to give up his nuclear weapons.
But even without full denuclearization, it is progress if there is a freeze on testing, a halt to nuclear production, an easing of tensions and an agreement on future steps. When an American crossed into North Korea from China last fall, the North Koreans expelled him rather than imprisoned him as a bargaining chip. The United States has likewise eased rules on humanitarian aid to North Korea.
Trump and Kim may claim some magical breakthrough, perhaps around a declaration of the end of the Korean War. But don't believe any magic. This is not a problem that will be solved this month or this year.
At its best, this will be a slog. We should pray that U.S.-North Korea relations become boring.
The greatest threat of this presidency was that Trump would stumble into a nuclear war, and in 2017 and 2018 the Pentagon was deeply concerned that this was a risk with Trump-Kim brinkmanship and Trump's boast that his nuclear button was bigger than Kim's.
If he and Kim pursue a painstaking peace process instead, in some illusory quest for a Nobel Peace Prize, we can live with that.

Clarence Thomas is right: Here's why Supreme Court should revisit libel law overreach

Texto completo: Last week, the Supreme Court refused to hear a case involving a libel claim by one of the women who accused comedian Bill Cosby of rape. That’s not terribly surprising. Since the Supreme Court’s 1964 decision in New York Times v. Sullivan, justices have interpreted the First Amendment to make libel claims very difficult to bring.
If you’re a public official — later expanded to include all “public figures,” a class that includes football coaches and celebrities generally, and even people who publicly accuse comedians of rape — you can’t recover without showing that the libelous statement was made with “actual malice,” meaning with knowledge it was false, or with reckless disregard of its falsity.
Even nonpublic figures have to show actual malice to recover punitive or presumed damages. The result is that libel claims are very hard to bring. This is especially true after the Supreme Court’s 1968 decision in St. Amant v. Thompson holding that a plaintiff has to show that the defendant entertained serious doubts that what he was publishing was true. Mere failure to investigate isn’t enough.
Read more commentary:
Don't gut libel ruling that gave us brave civil rights, Vietnam and Watergate coverage
Takeaway from BuzzFeed's Michael Cohen-Donald Trump report: Journalists police themselves
Trump's not being defamed. If he was, he wouldn't need to change the libel laws.
The court based these rules on the First Amendment’s protection of free speech and freedom of the press, arguing that the prospect of libel judgments would chill news media’s willingness to cover controversial issues.
But although the Supreme Court refused to hear the Cosby case, Justice Clarence Thomas argued that the court needs to undo New York Times v. Sullivan on the ground that it was a case of constitutional overreach. As Thomas wrote, “The constitutional libel rules adopted by this court in New York Times and its progeny broke sharply from the common law of libel, and there are sound reasons to question whether the First and 14th Amendments displaced this body of common law. ”
As a writer, liberal laws have been good to me
Justice Thomas would have the court revisit the issue, and possibly overturn Sullivan, arguing that the “actual malice” standard has no support in the Constitution.
Not surprisingly, this was poorly received by the press. Columnist Will Bunch in the Philadelphia Inquirer wrote, “Thomas wants to crush the free press just like southern segregationists of the 1950s. ” A column in the San Francisco Chronicle called it "Clarence Thomas vs. public’s right to know. " And in the always temperate ThinkProgress, we were told that Thomas has declared war on the free press.
Well. Speaking as a blogger, columnist and occasional reporter, I have to say the Sullivan ruling has been very, very good to me. You have to work pretty hard to commit actionable libel under present law, and like everyone else in the business of writing and speaking and so on, I’m pretty happy with that legal regime. But this doesn’t mean Thomas is wrong.
As even liberal law professor Cass Sunstein commented: “Thomas is right to point out that the constitutional foundations of New York Times v. Sullivan are not entirely firm. ” And it’s also true that the case’s original holding — in response to a coordinated plan by southern segregationist officials to use libel suits (brought in front of sympathetic local juries) to punish the national press for unfavorable coverage — has been expanded to cover all sorts of other cases, such as Cosby’s.
Like subsidies, someone pays for libel laws
It should be noted that limiting libel claims is essentially a subsidy for the chattering classes and the media. Like all subsidies, the costs come from someone else — in this case, someone whose reputation is ruined and who is left without a remedy. (And people who would perhaps not have been defamed at all if the news media worried more about libel exposure. )
I very much doubt that the Supreme Court will take up Thomas’ call to overturn New York Times v. Sullivan. But I would not be surprised to see it cut back on some of the more expansive follow-ups to that decision. The court has never given a convincing reason why “public figures" should be treated the same as “public officials. ” And the St. Amant holding that there’s no duty to do due diligence if you don’t suspect anything is wrong is a likely place to start cutting back.
Like Sunstein, I think it’s time to start thinking about ways to discourage defamation a bit more, and to provide remedies for people who are harmed. And I would not be surprised to see the Supreme Court go at least a little way down that road.

Wis. coaches gave girls awards for body parts

Texto completo: A cheerleading squad at a Kenosha high school has attracted the American Civil Liberties Union's attention after a parent complained that girls were being given "Big Boobie" and "Big Booty" awards.
By their coaches.
In 2018.
In real life.
Not a Seth MacFarlane movie.
At last year's annual banquet for the Tremper High School cheerleaders, according to The New York Times, coaches handed out some eye-popping awards.
"There was the Big Boobie award for the girl with the biggest breasts," the Times reports. "The coach giving the award, according to several parents among the 100 people in attendance, made a joke that the girl risked a concussion when she ran because of her 'enormous boobs.' There was a Big Booty award for another girl. In a video from the event, held at a local catering hall, the coach presenting the award said: 'We love her butt. Everybody loves her butt.'
"The String Bean award," the Times reports, "went to a freshman who, as the Tremper cheerleading coach Patti Uttech later told school administrators, 'was so light and skinny.'"
Last week, the ACLU tweeted that it's on the case: "BREAKING: Kenosha Unified School District is on notice. Our demand letter exposes their pervasive sex discrimination, including Tremper High School's cheerleading banquet objectifying girls' bodies. Awards distributed include 'Big Boobie' and 'Big Booty.'"
The demand letter maintains the school district violated Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, which prohibits sex discrimination in education programs that receive federal funds.
"Sexual harassment under Title IX includes not just physical sexual acts, but also verbal or nonverbal conduct that creates a hostile environment that denies or limits a student's ability to participate in or benefit from a school program or activity, such as a sports team," the letter states. "Wisconsin's Pupil Nondiscrimination Law contains similar prohibitions."
This year's awards banquet is in March. According to The Associated Press, the school will not give out the two controversial awards.
Uttech, the cheerleading coach, received a letter from the school district's human resources department shortly after last year's awards ceremony asking her to submit a formal resignation and send a letter apologizing to each of the cheerleaders who received the awards, the Times reports. Uttech and another coach, Nely DeThorne, wrote emails to the cheerleaders, saying they were "sincerely sorry for having caused you and your family any embarrassment or distress" but declined to resign, according to the Times.
A parent contacted the ACLU.
The ACLU wants the district to discipline the coaches who handed out the offending awards and mandate anti-harassment training for all district employees. If the district refuses, the ACLU will consider filing a lawsuit, Emma Roth, a lawyer for the ACLU Women's Rights Project, told the Times.
Meanwhile, let's talk about all the ways these girls have been failed by the adults tasked with teaching, shaping and inspiring them.
The adults who, in theory, are there to guide teenagers through the social minefield of high school.
The adults tasked with helping these girls nimbly sidestep lunchroom cliques and Snapchat bullying and Juuling and the pressure to drink and the pressure to smoke pot and the pressure to have sex and the pressure to look like a Kardashian and the pressure to be pleasing on the outside no matter what you've got going on on the inside.
The adults who could, in ways both subtle and overt, remind their young charges that high school can be wonderful or terrible or something in between, and regardless, it is temporary. And the things you're judged for, remembered for, celebrated for, ridiculed for in high school bear very little resemblance to the things that matter most in the real world.
Instead, a coach and her cohorts turned the girls into body parts. Body parts that have always gotten more than their fair share of attention in our culture. By the time a young woman graduates from high school, her breasts and her butt have been commented on, dress-coded, possibly groped, definitely judged and otherwise made to take up far more room on her list of worries than they should.
I'm trying to imagine being 16 or 17 and sitting in a room filled with my peers and their parents, gathered to celebrate a sport I love, and hearing an adult talk about my "enormous boobs." An adult I've been trained to revere or, at the very least, obey.
I'm trying to imagine what it would feel like to stand up and accept a "Big Boobie" award, all eyes on me as I do. I'm trying to imagine where I'd look. Down at the floor? Up at the ceiling? Into my coach's laughing eyes? Into the audience's?
I'm sorry any girl experienced that. I'm sorry adults so often forget how excruciating it can be to be young.
I'm glad the cheerleaders have the ACLU on their side. If any of them happen to be reading this, I'd like them to know they've got me on their side too.

Texto completo: The U.S. military blocked internet access to a Russian entity seeking to sow discord among Americans during the 2018 midtermelections, several U.S. officials said, a warning that the group's operations against the U.S. are not cost-free.
The strike on the Internet Research Agency in St. Petersburg, a company underwritten by an oligarch close to President Vladimir Putin, was part of the first offensive cyber campaign against Russia designed to thwart attempts to interfere with a U.S. election, the officials said.
"They basically took the IRA offline," according to one individual familiar with the matter who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss classified information. "They shut 'em down."
The operation marked the first muscle-flexing by U.S. Cyber Command, with intelligence from the National Security Agency, under new authorities it was granted by President Donald Trump and Congress last year to bolster offensive capabilities.
Russia's tactics are evolving, and some analysts were skeptical of the deterrent value on either the Russian troll factory or on Putin, who, according to U.S. officials, ordered an "influence" campaign in 2016 to undermine faith in U.S. democracy. Officials have also assessed that the Internet Research Agency works on behalf of the Kremlin.
Cyber Command and the NSA declined to comment.
Disruption to Internet Research Agency networks took place as Americans went to the polls and a day or so afterward, as the votes were tallied, to prevent the Russians from mounting a disinformation campaign casting doubt on results, according to officials. The blockage was so frustrating to the trolls that they complained to their system administrators about the disruption, the officials said.
The Internet Research Agency, according to federal prosecutors, is financed by Yevgeniy Prigozhin, a tycoon from St. Petersburg and an ally of Putin. Prigozhin, the Internet Research Agency and a company Prigozhin runs called Concord Management and Consulting, were among 16 Russian individuals and companies that a grand jury indicted a year ago as part of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.
Another element of the Cyber Command campaign, first reported by the New York Times, involved "direct messaging" that targeted the trolls as well as hackers who work for the Russian military intelligence agency, the GRU. Using emails, pop-ups, text or direct messages, U.S. operatives beginning last October let the Russians know that their real names and online handles were known and they should not interfere in other nations' affairs, defense officials said.

What Happens in Talks To Leave Bloc? 'Nothing'

Texto completo: BRUSSELS -- Since her Brexit plan was overwhelmingly rejected last month, Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain has repeatedly set off for Brussels, ostensibly to negotiate new terms for her country's departure from the European Union.
Each mission has ended without a deal, or even a hint of progress, leaving baffled observers to wonder what, exactly, Mrs. May and European officials talk about in these get-togethers. Now, a confidential document summarizing a Feb. 7 meeting from the European side has offered up an answer: "Nothing."
After each round of talks, top European officials provide a private readout to senior European diplomats, who in turn transcribe this for their own use. A European diplomat provided The New York Times with a copy of his document, which is a mixture of direct quotes and commentary. A spokesman for the British government in Brussels had no comment.
The readout shows that Mrs. May used the Feb. 7 meeting with the president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, to once again request something that has repeatedly been rejected: a time limit on the so-called backstop provision concerning the Irish border, which as it stands could keep Britain in the European Union's customs union indefinitely.
Ms. May suggested there was a possible alternative, but apparently did not offer any details about what that might be. "May did not explain what she meant by alternative arrangements to the backstop. Not at all," the document states.
The summary reveals what many observers have long concluded: that for all the political rhetoric, talks between Britain and Europe have gone nowhere. The document underscores Europe's growing conviction that Ms. May has no proposal to resolve the current deadlock in negotiations and is too politically hobbled to propose one. The document paints a picture of an essentially fruitless negotiating process in recent months that is kept alive largely to buy time for Mrs. May's political brinkmanship at home.
"At this point, there is only room for discussion inside Britain, but not with us," the Feb. 7 summary read, underscoring the conclusion that Ms. May's problems were domestic, political and unlikely to be resolved by talking to European leaders.
After talking to Mr. Juncker, Mrs. May met Donald Tusk, president of the European Council. The document describes that meeting as "Mostly a repeat of the conversation with Juncker."
Mr. Tusk encouraged Mrs. May to work with Jeremy Corbyn, the left-wing leader of the opposition Labour Party, to forge a compromise. But Ms. May replied that, while the two had been in touch, members of her own Conservative Party were unlikely to get behind any of his ideas, according to the summary.
Mr. Tusk suggested that, whatever deal Mrs. May envisioned, she should build support for it in London before asking leaders of other European nations to support it. That would avoid a repeat of last month's spectacular defeat, in which Parliament roundly rejected a Brexit deal that Mrs. May had brokered with Europe.
"You should get a vote or do a deal with Corbyn first," Mr. Tusk said, according to the document.
"May barely reacted," the document states.
Experts said Mrs. May's ambiguity was somewhat strategic, reflecting a difficult political position. "Whenever the government writes anything down or gives any details, it produces a negative reaction," said Tony Travers, professor of government at the London School of Economics. "So the great beauty of having an unstated, ambiguous position is it keeps everybody on side back in London."
The result, he said, was that Ms. May went into negotiations without a position and without anything to request. "She's saying, 'I need you to give me something. Tell me what it is,' " Professor Travers said.
But time is running out. Britain is scheduled to leave the European Union on March 29, and business leaders, economists and other experts warn that leaving without a deal on trade, borders and other issues could be disastrous.
With no support for the withdrawal agreement she brokered, and no sign that she can negotiate a better one in the next few weeks, Mrs. May has few options. Opposition party members have accused her of stalling for time, gambling that lawmakers will ultimately back her deal when faced with the prospect of a either no-deal Brexit or no Brexit at all.
Many European officials also see that calculation at work. The document obtained by The Times concludes that Ms. May's visit was essentially a stalling tactic.
"The visit was just to win time, because content-wise it was nothing."

Texto completo: President Donald Trump announced Monday that American citizen Danny Burch has been freed after 18 months of captivity in Yemen in what the State Department suggested was a rescue operation.
In a statement, Trump thanked the United Arab Emirates for its role in reuniting Burch with his family.
"Danny's recovery reflects the best of what the United States and its partners can accomplish," Trump said.
He said freeing Americans held overseas "is a priority of my administration." and added that 20 American captives have been released since his victory in the 2016 presidential election.
"We maintain constant and intensive diplomatic, intelligence, and law enforcement cooperation within the United States government and with our foreign partners," Trump said in a statement that was echoed by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.
Pompeo thanked the Emiratis; Robert O'Brien, the special presidential envoy for hostage affairs; the U.S. Embassy in Abu Dhabi; and the FBI's Hostage Recovery Fusion Cell for working to free Burch.
"Today, he is safe and secure and is reunited with his wife and children," Pompeo said.
The White House did not provide additional details on Burch's case, citing privacy concerns. However Pompeo's statement was titled "On the Rescue of Danny Burch from Captivity."
Yemen has been riven by a deadly civil war since 2015, and Burch's abduction had been blamed on Iranian-backed Houthi rebels.
Burch, who is from eastern Texas and is married to a Yemeni national, had lived in the country for years working for an oil company. He was reportedly kidnapped by the rebels in Sept. 2017. His wife told The New York Times at the time that Burch took had left their home in the capital of Sanaa to take their sons to a sports club but never returned.
She said police later told her that Burch had been stopped by five armed men in civilian clothes who took him away.
There had been reports of his release in January of last year but U.S. officials said Monday those had been erroneous.

$773 Million Later, de Blasio Ends School Improvement Initiative

Texto completo: [What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.]
Mayor Bill de Blasio is canceling one of his signature education initiatives, acknowledging that despite spending $773 million he was unable to turn around many long-struggling public schools in three years after decades of previous interventions had also failed.
The end of the initiative, called Renewal, is a blow to Mr. de Blasio, who had hoped that success would bolster his effort to build a national reputation for innovative policies. Urban educators around the country had also looked to Renewal as a model for improving underperforming schools in historically troubled districts, rather than closing them.
Instead, the program has been plagued by bureaucratic confusion and uneven academic results since Mr. de Blasio began it in 2014. Though some of the nearly 100 low-performing public schools have shown better results, many have fallen short of the improvements that Mr. de Blasio predicted. The Renewal label itself caused parents to seek other options, causing enrollment in some schools to plummet.
The New York Times reported in October that Mr. de Blasio was preparing to close Renewal, and that city officials had known some Renewal schools were likely to fail but had left most of them open anyway. As a result, officials essentially kept thousands of children in classrooms where they had little if any chance of thriving.
The question of how to fix broken schools is a great unknown in education, particularly in big city school districts.
While some small cities like Lawrence, Mass., and Camden, N.J., have achieved some success with different strategies, no large school system has cracked the code, despite decades of often costly attempts.
As education fads have come and gone, politicians have flipped between school improvement models based on punitive measures like closure and teacher firing and softer approaches that rely on pouring resources into schools.
In a lengthy interview on Monday, Mr. de Blasio defended the goals of the program, but said its execution was flawed.
"I'm at peace that with the information we had and the structure we had at the time, it was a sensible approach," he said. But he added, "I would not do it again that way."
Mr. de Blasio said the reorganization of the Department of Education's behemoth bureaucracy, undertaken last year by his schools chancellor, Richard A. Carranza, would help smooth out the confusing lines of authority that led to frustration among principals and teachers in Renewal schools.
Though only about 25 percent of the schools in the program have improved enough to require less investment and support on the four-year timeline Mr. de Blasio established, the mayor insisted that Renewal still achieved its "core mission."
"We never said from day one, 'We guarantee all of them will become paradise,"' he said, referring to the schools in the program. "We knew that there could well be closures and ones that didn't work."
"We defined success as whether most of the schools could move substantially in the right direction -- and that, we got," Mr. de Blasio added.
Though about a quarter of the schools improved enough to exit the program after three years, another quarter closed, and the remaining 50 will remain open but in a limbo state: They will continue to receive indefinitely much of the same support they did as Renewal schools, but without the Renewal label. The city could still close any of these schools in future years, officials said.
Mr. de Blasio said he is confident that those schools are "on a path for success," even though they are taking more time to change than his administration first hoped.
"We put ourselves on this very aggressive three-year timeline. In retrospect, that was probably an unrealistic timeline in some cases," he said. Mr. de Blasio eventually added a fourth year to the program.
Renewal will not be replaced by an entirely different school improvement program. Instead, the city will direct funding and academic support to schools most in need of help, under a strategy it is calling comprehensive school support, by consulting student achievement data under a new centralized data system known as Edu Stat.
That strategy will technically apply to all schools in the system, though the initial focus will be on schools that State Education Department officials consider low-performing. Schools will not be publicly labeled low-performing, in part to avoid the stigma that the Renewal label gave schools, which city officials believe led to dwindling enrollment as parents searched for other options.
The Renewal schools that did succeed tended to have particularly strong principals, according to a report prepared by city officials about the end of the program, and an emphasis on using student achievement data to identify problems. The high schools in the program, which used a structured data-tracking system, made the most collective progress: The average graduation rate rose to 72 percent last year, up from 52 percent in 2014.
Suspensions also dropped by more than 50 percent across all Renewal schools during that same period, which is notable since many of the schools had discipline issues, and attendance crept up by about 4 percent over the last four years.
Mr. de Blasio's administration should have been quicker to replace principals in the schools that were taking the longest time to improve, according to the report, and should have avoided marking schools with a label that denoted poor performance, which scared off parents.
Renewal was created in part as a rebuke to former mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's plan to fix long-suffering schools, which relied on shuttering more than 100 schools and opening dozens of smaller schools with specific themes in their place, typically staffed by new principals and different teachers. Mr. Bloomberg put a heavy emphasis on using data to make decisions about schools, and Mr. de Blasio's administration now seems to be heading in that direction.
Mr. Bloomberg's small schools plan led to an increase in high school graduation rates and students going to college, all at a lower cost to the city than students in other types of schools, according to a series of studies. But while results were encouraging, the plan did not rescue all the schools it touched: More than a third of the schools that ended up on the original Renewal list were created during Mr. Bloomberg's tenure.
Many advocacy groups and local politicians, including Mr. de Blasio, then the public advocate, railed against school closures. The city's teachers' union, the United Federation of Teachers, was the most powerful lobby against closures. The union's president, Michael Mulgrew, who has a close ear to the ground in schools, has been critical of the Renewal program's execution.
But because the program was based on the union-friendly theory that struggling schools need more resources, rather than more effective teachers, Mr. Mulgrew may face fresh questions about not only the execution but the design of the program.
Mr. de Blasio insisted on Monday that developing a close relationship with the teachers' union has led to a stronger school system. He said that ongoing conflict between Mr. Bloomberg's administration and the U.F.T. led to "paralysis and conflict," and he pointed to the national turn away from education reform and toward teachers, as is evident in the recent wave of teacher strikes and growing political hostility toward charter schools.
"The era of closing schools has come to an end," the mayor said.

Texto completo: To watch Rep. Duncan Hunter on TV is to see a diligent, baritone-voiced congressman championing conservative causes and defending soldiers accused of war crimes. But on Capitol Hill, Hunter, R-Alpine, is hamstrung, stripped of committee assignments that are vital to a lawmaker’s influence and effectiveness.
Then-House Speaker Paul Ryan forced Hunter to resign from the Armed Services, Education and the Workforce, and Transportation and Infrastructure committees last August, following a 60-count federal indictment accusing Hunter and wife, Margaret, of illegally spending $250,000 in campaign funds on groceries, an Italian vacation and airfare for the family’s pet rabbit, among other personal expenses and filing false records.
The Hunters, who pleaded not guilty – Duncan Hunter denounced the charges as politically motivated – are scheduled for trial in September. Until then, Duncan Hunter, 42, whose district includes most of Temecula, is doing what he can to stay – or at least appear – relevant. “Politically, Hunter is radioactive,” said Jack Pitney, a professor of politics at Claremont McKenna College. “The charges against him involve sleazy corruption, not some great matter of national policy. So his influence on other lawmakers is pretty limited.
“The staff can take care of constituent services, but they typically do not (need) much involvement by the member. Yes, members can sit on the floor and cast votes, but it would be extremely rare for a single vote to decide a major measure.”
Lacking committees is “a pretty big deal,” said Robert Boatright, a political science professor at Clark University in Worcester, Massachusetts. “Legislators without committee assignments are limited in their ability to procure benefits for their districts, and they don’t really have that much to do during the days they spend in Washington.”
“With that said, Republicans are now in the minority, so all Republicans are facing a reduction in their ability to deliver benefits for their constituents. So this is less harmful than it would have been had Republicans remained in the majority.”
It’s unclear whether Hunter’s constituents will notice or care about his lack of committee assignments. “I have noticed no difference either way,” said Temecula Mayor Mike Naggar.
Hunter declined interview requests. His spokesman, Michael Harrison, said the 10-year congressman “will continue working hard on the issues he believes are most important to both his constituents and the country as a whole.”
While being committee-less “is not ideal, it by no means is keeping Congressman Hunter from doing the work he was elected to do,” Harrison added.
Hunter represents California’s 50th Congressional District, a ruby red enclave in a deep-blue state where registered Republican voters outnumber registered Democrats by 13 percentage points.
Hunter, whose father, Duncan Hunter Sr., represented the district for almost 30 years, traditionally cruises to re-election, winning with 63 percent of the vote in 2016 and 71 percent in 2014.
He got just 52 percent of the vote last November in beating Democrat Ammar Campa-Najjar, who out-raised Hunter and plans to run for the seat in 2020. Hunter campaign ads tying Campa-Najjar, a Christian and native Southern Californian of Palestinian and Mexican heritage, to terrorism spurred accusations of racism and fear-mongering.
The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee put Hunter on its 2020 target list. Besides Campa-Najjar, Democrat Alex Balkin and Republicans Matt Rahn, Bill Wells and Larry Wilske have filed to run for Hunter’s seat in 2020.
Hunter isn’t the only committee-less congressman. Rep. Chris Collins, R-New York, who was charged with insider trading, has no assignments, and Iowa Republican Steve King, lost his committee seats after telling The New York Times “White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization – how did that language become offensive?”
“I suppose they can form a ‘pariah caucus,’” Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Maryland, told POLITICO.
Hunter stood out before his legal woes. Named Washington’s top “Party Animal” by Washingtonian magazine in 2014, Hunter made headlines for vaping during a congressional hearing, and he was one of the first congressmen to endorse then-candidate Donald Trump.
100-day plan
Hunter is still allowed to join legislative caucuses. A list of caucus memberships on his House website includes the Congressional Wine Caucus, Congressional Shipbuilding Caucus, Congressional Pro-Life Caucus, and the House Border Security Caucus.
After being sworn in last month, Hunter announced a “First 100-Day Initiative,” which he described in a February constituent newsletter as a series of bills “to implement common-sense reforms that will benefit the lives of everyday Americans.”
They include the AMERICA Act to protect census respondents’ data, the BRAVE Act to raise the burial allowance for veteran families and the No Funding for Sanctuary Campuses Act, which would deny federal funds to colleges and universities that don’t cooperate with federal efforts to enforce immigration law.
The odds are against Hunter’s bills passing the Democrat-controlled House.
A Marine Corps veteran of Iraq and Afghanistan, Hunter has come to the aid of Special Operations Chief Eddie Gallagher, a Navy SEAL accused of murdering an Islamic State prisoner of war, as well as Army Maj. Matt Golsteyn, a Green Beret charged with premeditated murder in the death of a suspected Taliban bomb maker.
Gallagher was charged “based on inconsistent testimony and without any physical evidence,” Hunter wrote in his February newsletter. The congressman has asked the president to review Gallagher’s case.
Regarding Golsteyn, “what I think we have here is a case of what the U.S. government would call compassionate combat,” Hunter told “Fox & Friends” on Wednesday, Feb. 13.
Under George W. Bush and Barack Obama “(the government) wanted us to kill the bad guys, but in the right way, meaning they want us to kill guys compassionately and only under the rules of engagement that they say to you,” Hunter said.
Otherwise, “the U.S. government then is going to try you for murder and put you in jail, even if you’re a decorated Green Beret (or) if you’re a Navy SEAL.”
This year, Hunter has spoken to Fox News other conservative media about border security, his legislation, Gallagher and Golsteyn, the federal government shutdown and his reaction to Trump’s State of the Union Address.
He shares clips of those appearances on social media. None of the interviews posted to his Twitter account in February mention the indictment, although in a Fox News interview shortly after he was charged, Hunter said his wife handled his finances and “was also the campaign manager so whatever she did, that’ll be looked at too, I’m sure, but I didn’t do it.”
‘Can’t do it’
It’s unclear what would happen if Hunter pleads guilty or is convicted, although he likely would face pressure to resign.
Hunter could serve from behind bars, although he couldn’t vote and the House could move to expel him, said Thad Kousser, a UC San Diego political science professor. If Hunter left office before November 2020, a special election would be held to fill his seat.
Without committees, Boatright said Hunter could try to boost his influence in caucuses and informal working groups.
“Otherwise, start thinking through job options for what to do after Congress!” he said. “Or spend more time in the district (and) treat the lack of committee assignments like a sort of sabbatical.”
Hunter’s staff “will put out material making it seem as if he is doing a lot, even though he is not,” Pitney said.
“Trying to be an effective House member without serving on a committee is like trying to play in the Super Bowl without leaving the locker room. You can’t do it.”

UTAH POLITICIANS DEFY THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE STATE LEGISLATORS TAKE HEALTH INSURANCE FROM 60,000 CITIZENS DESPITE THE RESULTS OF A REFERENDUM

Texto completo: In November, Utahans voted to provide health insurance for about 150,000 state residents who lacked it. This month, Utah legislators overruled their own constituents and took away insurance from about 60,000 of those 150,000 people.
The legislators claimed they were trying to save money, but that's not a credible rationale: The federal government would have covered the bulk of the cost. The true reason - which the legislators weren't willing to admit publicly - was a philosophical objection to government-provided health insurance.
Utah's turnabout is the latest worrisome example of politicians rejecting the will of voters.
The offending politicians have been mostly Republican, as in Utah. "You see a rising, disturbing trend here of equivocation, if not worse, in the commitment to democratic norms on the part of a growing number of Republicans," Larry Diamond, a Stanford University democracy expert, told my New York Times colleague Ian Prasad Philbrick. "Is this what the Republican Party wants to be? The anti-democracy party?"
There also has been one major example of Democratic officials deciding they don't care what their constituents want: Last year, the city council in the District of Columbia reversed an increase in the minimum wage for tipped workers, even though the ballot initiative approving it had passed with 55 percent of the vote.
City Lab's Kriston Capps and Sarah Holder have put together a list of state legislatures that have overruled their own voters, including in Idaho, Maine and Michigan. In Missouri, some legislators have pushed to subvert a ballot initiative that would reduce gerrymandering. And in Utah, the legislature has also partly overturned a new law on medical marijuana.
I find that last example especially helpful in thinking through my own view about this trend. I would vote against marijuana legalization, because I think it promotes drug use that damages health. But if my state voted to legalize marijuana in a referendum, I would still be unhappy if the legislature then reversed the result.
A final point: I understand why some political scientists dislike government by ballot initiative. Direct democracy can sometimes create problematic laws. So if a state legislature wanted to reduce the ability of voters to make laws by referendum, I could see arguments in favor of doing so. But that's very different from undoing the result of a referendum that already has passed.

Chinese and Iranian Hackers Have Returned

Texto completo: Each week, technology reporters and columnists from The New York Times review the week's news , offering analysis and maybe a joke or two about the most important developments in the tech industry. Want this newsletter in your inbox? Sign up here .

Hello, dear readers! I'm Nicole Perlroth, cybersecurity reporter here at The Times. I'm afraid the week's news isn't all unicorns and rainbows.
This should come as a shock to no one, but President Trump's confrontational diplomacy has energized state hackers in Iran and China. They are targeting companies and government agencies in the United States with renewed gusto, after a multiyear lull. The rebound in activity comes on top of the continuing threat from Russians, who have already started hacking European civil society groups before elections there in May.
Consider this a preview of 2020.
With the United States pulling out of the nuclear deal with Iran, Iranian hackers are hitting American banks, businesses and federal agencies with cyberattacks. They've significantly stepped up their game: harder to track down and more effective.
We're no longer talking so-called denial-of-service attacks that make websites hiccup. They're exploiting weaknesses in the internet's backbone to steal web traffic as it passes between government agencies, banks and businesses that manage their back-end infrastructure.
The attacks rattled Homeland Security officials, who triggered an emergency alert during the government shutdown last month. Security researchers say that the attacks have not relented and that they're hitting American targets with an unnerving success rate.
The news out of China is even more troubling. Mr. Trump's trade confrontations with Beijing have energized state hackers in Beijing, who have renewed attacks on American businesses, especially in high-tech and defense companies.
Chinese industrial espionage notably dropped after President Barack Obama and President Xi Jinping of China reached a 2015 deal to cease cybertheft of trade secrets. Now, the gloves are off.
Miriam Wugmeister, a cybersecurity specialist at the law firm Morrison Foerster, told me that Fortune 500 companies were being hit at "shockingly high" rates.
It's rare that victims step forward -- state laws require companies to disclose breaches only if personal data is compromised -- but T-Mobile, Boeing and General Electric Aviation are among the companies in the crossfire.
If that's not worrying you, consider my colleague Sui-Lee Wee's blockbuster report Thursday on China's campaign to build a DNA database, in part to track and suppress China's minority Uighur population. Beijing could not have pulled this off without a big helping hand from Thermo Fisher, a Massachusetts equipment maker, and genetic material provided by a prominent Yale University researcher who says he was unaware the material was used as a surveillance tool.
In other news:
■ Lyft is racing to beat Uber to an initial public offering, my colleagues Mike Isaac and Kate Conger reported. Lyft is hoping to debut on the Nasdaq at a $20 billion to $25 billion valuation before it's overshadowed by its bigger ride-hailing competitor, Uber, which bankers initially pegged at a $120 billion valuation.
■ Google is losing advertisers after a YouTuber posted video showing the prevalence of pedophiles who comment on videos of children doing regular activities like gymnastics or stretching. My colleagues Dai Wakabayashi and Sapna Maheshwari reported that major brands like Nestlé and Epic Games have pulled advertising after users flagged their ads on children's videos targeted by pedophiles.
YouTube and other big tech companies are already under fire for failing to aggressively police their platforms. Last month, YouTube said it had tweaked its algorithm to stop recommending conspiracy theories to users. This past week, my colleague Kevin Roose wrote a terrific piece outlining one of the central challenges for the company: Some of YouTube's biggest stars (and ad magnets) push conspiracies.
Google is hardly the only company struggling with misinformation. This month, The Guardian discovered that YouTube's recommendation algorithms and Facebook's search results were still steering viewers from fact-based medical information to anti-vaccine misinformation. All this as the Pacific Northwest is still reeling from an emergency measles outbreak.
■ Karl Lagerfeld, the fashion icon, died in Paris on Tuesday. True to form, no obituary had an accurate read on his age, though The Times noted he was "generally thought to be 85."
A tech newsletter this depressing would not be complete without my favorite Lagerfeld quote: "Sweatpants are a sign of defeat. You lost control of your life, so you bought some sweatpants." (Thank God Karl Lagerfeld never set foot in Silicon Valley.)

Texto completo: PepsiCo's former chairwoman and CEO, who steered the global giant to a new and more prosperous direction, will be the keynote speaker at the Lancaster Chamber’s 147th annual dinner.
Indra Nooyi will address the Thursday, May 30 gathering at the Lancaster County Convention Center, 25 S. Queen St. The event is the county’s biggest business get-together, with up to 2,500 people attending.
Nooyi, 63, spent 12 years in the two roles, stepping down as CEO in October and as chairwoman in January.
“She’s got an amazing story to share of a woman from India who rose up through the ranks in business and ultimately transformed one of the best-known brands in the world...,” said chamber President Tom Baldrige.
Nooyi instilled “very clear business principles and social priorities” in PepsiCo, noted Baldrige.
In doing so, she demonstrated how major corporations can “leverage their platform for good with not only their workers and their customers but also with their community.”
Baldrige added: “It’s that message, which we think is increasingly resonating with the local business community, that made her a perfect choice” for the dinner’s keynote speaker.
Nooyi worked at Johnson & Johnson, Motorola and elsewhere before joining PepsiCo in 1994. She spent a year as chief financial officer, then five years as president and CFO, before rising to CEO.
The resident of Greenwich, Connecticut, has been credited for spearheading PepsiCo’s acquisition of Tropicana, Quaker Oats (including Gatorade) and at-home soda maker SodaStream, while pushing PepsiCo toward healthier foods.
Those feats brought her recognition by Forbes, Fortune, The Wall Street Journal and other publications as one of the world’s most influential businesswomen.
When Nooyi announced in 2018 she was stepping down, The New York Times wrote:
“Ms. Nooyi’s impact on PepsiCo cannot be overstated. Over the past decade, she has transformed the company dramatically, expanding its presence in international markets, and also shifting its products increasingly into healthier beverage and snack choices. ...
“Since she took over (as CEO), revenue has grown to $63.5 billion from $35 billion in 2006, while the company’s share price has nearly doubled in that time,” the newspaper pointed out.
That surge in revenue turned PepsiCo into the world's second largest food-and-beverage firm, trailing only Nestle.
“She’s clearly one of the most successful (business) leaders in the last 10 years,” said chamber Chairman Craig Kauffman, president and CEO of PeoplesBank.
Baldrige put it this way: “While she is not a household name, she is perhaps as well known in international business as any other person. We’re honored to bring her to Lancaster.”
He described Nooyi as a “poised, articulate and inspirational” speaker. Her remarks, which have yet to be given a title, will provide valuable and practical insights, he said.
“People who go will be really happy they went,” said Kauffman.
Baldrige declined to disclose Nooyi’s fee.
The annual dinner will run from 5 to 9 p.m. Tickets are $225. Chamber investors (formerly called members) can buy tickets now. The general public can buy tickets beginning at 8 a.m. March 4.

Oscars: Anne Hathaway jokes about her cringe-worthy hosting job: 'It's already been worse'

Texto completo: After all the drama and controversy surrounding the first host-less Academy Awards in 30 years, Anne Hathaway is here to remind us that it might not be so bad.
The actress, 36, co-hosted the 2011 Oscars with James Franco, in what became one of the most awkward and infamous moments in the award show's now-91 year history. Critics complained Franco looked half-asleep, leaving Hathaway to overcompensate with her own enthusiasm.
"No matter what happens with today's show, just remember, it's already been worse," she wrote. "Happy Oscars!"
This isn't the first time Hathaway has acknowledged her disappointment in the hosting gig. In a 2015 interview with The New York Times Magazine, she gave a word of advice to the next Oscars host, Neil Patrick Harris.
"Do the opposite of what I did, and you’ll be fine," she joked. "He’ll be great. "

NYT V. Sullivan More Important Than Ever Before

Texto completo: In calling for a re-examination of the landmark case New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas adopted an unduly generous view of the conduct of local and state governments regarding free press rights under the First Amendment.
The Supreme Court decided Sullivan in 1964, after a federal district court in Alabama found that a civil rights organization’s ad in The New York Times had damaged the reputation of an Alabama sheriff who was identified by implication in the ad.
Sullivan established a higher standard for public officials and public figures to prove defamation of character. They would have to prove actual malice on the part of the accused defamer, that the publication had acted with “reckless disregard for the truth.”
Thomas, in an opinion related to a case in which one of Bill Cosby’s sexual assault victims had sued him for defamation, said the Founders did not deal specifically with the status of public officials or public figures when crafting the First Amendment.
“The states,” he wrote, “are perfectly capable of striking an acceptable balance between encouraging robust public discourse and providing a meaningful remedy for reputational harm.”
Well, they might be capable of it but there is abundant evidence that they did not do so prior to the Sullivan decision. Public officials in Southern states regularly used libel suits to stifle press coverage of the civil rights movement. At the time of Sullivan, suits seeking more than $300 million in damages were pending in Southern state courts over such coverage.
Thomas accused his predecessors of, basically, making up the decision as a matter of public policy rather than of constitutional law.
But Justice William Brennan, who wrote the Sullivan opinion, said the First Amendment’s press freedom guarantee represented the Founders’ “commitment to the principle that debate on public issues should be uninhibited, robust, and wide-open, and that it may well include vehement, caustic, and sometimes unpleasantly sharp attacks on government and public officials.”
It is extraordinarily naïve to believe that many public officials would attack the press for routine news coverage in the absence of Sullivan. President Donald Trump has said as much, including even satire such as that on “Saturday Night Live.”
Sullivan is not just constitutionally valid; it is more important than ever.

Texto completo: Olympic and world champion gymnast Gabby Douglas is no stranger to firsts.
At the 2012 Olympic Games in London, she became the first African-American woman to win a gold medal in the all-around individual event.
Also in London, Douglas became the first American gymnast to capture gold in both the all-round and team competitions at the same Olympics.
Four years later, she was the first all-round gold medalist in U.S. history to return to a second Olympics. In Rio at the team competition, she earned her third Olympic gold medal.
And on May 14, Douglas will be a pioneer in a different realm as the first female keynote speaker at the Savannah Morning News/savannahnow.com Best of Preps banquet, presented by the Georgia Ports Authority.
The ninth annual event, which honors top varsity athletes and coaches from area high schools, is 6-9 p.m. at the Westin Savannah Harbor Golf Resort & Spa on Hutchinson Island.
In the first eight years, each keynote speaker was a male, nearly all whom gained fame in Georgia: Atlanta Falcons quarterback Matt Ryan (2011); former Atlanta Braves stars John Smoltz (2011) and Chipper Jones (2015); former University of Georgia stars Hines Ward
(2014), Todd Gurley (2016), David Greene (2017) and David Pollack (2018); as well as former NFL great Marshall Faulk (2013).
Douglas, a 23-year-old Virginia native, can be expected to bring her own unique perspective. A gymnast since age 6, she was a Virginia state champion by age 8. She was selected for the U.S. Olympic team at 16 and became an international star.
Corporations noted the teen's popularity and she endorsed brands such as Nike, Capri Sun, Proctor & Gamble, Royal Caribbean, AT&T, Target, McDonald's and more.
She was one of Barbara Walters' "10 Most Fascinating People of 2012" as well as The Associated Press' Female Athlete of the Year for 2012.
Douglas, who has earned two team gold medals and one individual silver medal at world championships, also has two New York Times bestselling books to her credit: "Raising the Bar" and "Grace, Gold, and Glory: My Leap of Faith."
She's been the subject of a Lifetime network movie in 2013, and an Oxygen channel reality television shown leading up to the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio. Mattel has launched a signature Gabby Douglas Barbie Doll.

'Merchants' casts grim eye on news business

Texto completo: One of the facts bemoaned by traditional journalists in the current state of the news business is that, with a growing banquet of news to offer on any given day, in any given hour, consumers are opting for boiled down listicles and scannable reads.
It's the antithesis in style to what The New York Times used to embody, particularly by its former senior editorial leader, Jill Abramson, the first woman to serve as the paper's Washington bureau chief, managing editor and executive editor – the top job in American print journalism.
But as everyone knows , Abramson didn't last long at the top; just three years. In May 2014, she was fired for allegedly poor management and being too "difficult" for even hard-boiled Times journalists to handle.
Her account of what happened as laid out in her new book, "Merchants of Truth: The Business of News and the Fight for Facts," is absorbing and fair – and it's likely the first section many journalists will turn to.
"There was no simple reason I was fired. I was a less than stellar manager, but I also had been judged by an unfair double standard applied to many women leaders. Most of all, I became the first woman editor at a very bad time in journalism," she writes.
Now comes "Merchants," published Tuesday (Simon & Schuster, ).
Reviews have been generally positive, mixed with sharp criticism. There already has been a contretemps over whether she accused the Times of being biased against President Donald Trump in its coverage. She batted that away as an exaggeration of something taken out of context. A fair reading backs her up.
Now she and her publisher are dealing with more serious charges of factual errors and plagiarism lodged late Wednesday in a series of tweets on Twitter by a reporter for one of the four news organizations she examines in the book, Vice – which under her gaze does not come off as a journalistic paragon.
Simon & Schuster issued a statement Thursday promising revisions if warranted in the 534-page book. Abramson also issued a statement to USA TODAY that the passages in question involve facts that were imperfectly cited in her 70 pages of footnotes. "I wouldn't want even a misplaced comma so I will promptly fix these footnotes and quotations as I have corrected other material that Vice contested," she said.
Meanwhile, the book as published documents the crisis: Journalism may have not yet been annihilated but the barbarians are at the gate and banging hard. More news than ever is out there and more people than ever are in need of reliable information in order for democracy to function, Abramson observes.
At the same time, she reports, the journalism business model is stuttering and a steadier replacement is not yet obvious. Every news company struggles to produce a product for the digital age amid sharp staff cuts, while more consumers, marinated in "the internet is free!" assumptions, are unwilling to pay for it, Abramson says.
The author explores this grim state through the experiences of two legacy media titans, her former employer, the Times, and the Washington Post, fighting to retain their "values" in a maelstrom, and two digital titans, BuzzFeed and Vice, "improbable players" in an arena where social media drives large numbers of consumers to news.
"I was determined to capture this moment of wrenching transition – and to do it as a reporter, my first calling," Abramson writes.
She has her pet peeves: The sometimes dishonest nature of clickbait headlines, designed to capture attention but promising more than they deliver. Tedious business meetings watching PowerPoint presentations of eye-glazing data charts. The "ridiculously" few women in senior editing jobs at the Times, a deficit she is most proud of improving during her tenure.
She is alarmed about the chipping away of the traditional wall between the news side and the business side. When the new CEO of the Times told her he expected new "revenue-producing products" to come from the newsroom, she snapped, "If that's what you expect, you have the wrong executive editor ... The truth had flown out of my mouth before I could edit either its substance or tone."
Abramson doesn't see an entirely trouble-free future for any of her examined news organizations, despite their various successes. "All four are endangered," she warns. That even goes for the Post, which was rescued in 2013 by its "white knight," Amazon billionaire Jeff Bezos, who bought the family-owned paper for $250 million with the idea that "restoring its glory would be a contribution to democracy."
For legacy media survivors, following the trials and tribulations of two newspapers may involve equal measures of envy, dread and schadenfreude. BuzzFeed and Vice may seem like alien entities.
Abramson traces how BuzzFeed began with a steady diet viral cat videos, but founder and "virality" genius Jonah Peretti and his team figured out how to connect with a mostly disaffected young audience through their emotions – at the "beating heart of the internet." They pioneered a new business model – native advertising – and by the end of 2011, BuzzFeed had "pivoted" to original news reporting, beefing up its reporting staff with a goal of being taken seriously.
Vice started out as a print lads mag constantly pushing the bounds of bad taste in the quest to be "edgy," which led to such outrages as "The Racist Issue." In 2017, Vice's 18 hours of footage of the deadly Charlottesville, Va., Unite the Right rally garnered a total of 50 million views and became the "defining image" of the violence, Abramson says.
Non-journalists may find "Merchants" dense and complicated, with something surprising or infuriating on every page. Journalists working today already know in their guts most of what Abramson is reporting, if not in the depressing detail she presents.
Abramson earns three stars for her thoroughness and insights, but this is not a beach read, and certainly not a happy read. Unless, of course, you believe journalists are the enemy of the people.

Oscars 2019: I can't make myself like 'Roma.' It's about Mexico's elite, not a maid.

Resumen: The director uses the stick figure of an indigenous maid to cater to inequality concerns, but his real subjects are himself and Mexico's upper class.

Texto completo: As I watched it on Netflix, I found I couldn’t much like “Roma,” a top Oscars contender that the streaming service is massively promoting for best picture. I started mulling over why I felt so at odds with near universal opinion and read some of the effusive reviews (Peter Bradshaw in The Guardian: “thrilling, engrossing, moving”). I found I liked them even less.
If Alfonso Cuarón, the director, had limited himself to the alternately subtle and violent portrait he draws of the Mexico City of his youth — a city I came to love, for all its problems, when I lived there many years later — I would have applauded. And I doubt “Roma” would have received nearly such wide attention or praise.
“A personal epic set in Mexico City in the early 1970s,” writes Manohla Dargis in The New York Times, the film “centers on a young indigenous woman who works as a maid for a middle-class, white family. ” “Roma” thus caught a wave of concern about racial inequality. Cuarón even underlined the point by dedicating it to his actual nanny, also indigenous. Just how does a white, upper-class director’s personal epic center on an indigenous woman?
Read more commentary:
Oscars 2019: 'Green Book' shows Hollywood's blatant contempt for Italian-Americans
'Black Panther' empowers students of color by highlighting Africa's centuries of greatness
Celebrate 'Crazy Rich Asians,' flaws and all. It has redefined Hollywood and being Asian.
'A Star is Born': What the movie gets wrong about treatment for alcohol, opioid addiction
Parenthetically, contrary to what critics say, this was not a middle-class Mexican family. Only 2 percent of Mexicans of that era had even attended university. The father in the film is an accomplished doctor, the mother a biochemist. The family is upper-class, full stop.
Cleo, the indigenous nanny, does get the most camera time. We see details of her life from dawn to dusk: waking the children and putting them to sleep, mutely washing dog dirt from the Ford Galaxie’s tiled parking spot, wiping the mouthpiece of a phone to clean off germs after answering it. We also see, in Cleo, the emotional ties that have forever bound poor, indigenous Mexico to wealthier, lighter-skinned Mexico. But the human being who must lurk somewhere between the quotidian details and socioeconomic symbol is hardly visible.
Cleo's character is lost in upper-class perspective
Cleo speaks in telegraphic phrases, at best. In a typical scene, the wife of the household, abandoned by her husband, comes home from a drunken spree and mutters to her: “No matter what they tell you, we women are always alone. ” The statement is about women in general, not an indigenous woman, and the person who articulates it is upper-class. Cleo just stares back.
We see virtually nothing of Cleo’s life outside the family orbit. She’s from “a dusty Mixtec village somewhere in Oaxaca,” Ty Burr colorfully writes in The Boston Globe. Actually, we aren’t told the village is dusty, only that she’s from the poor state of Oaxaca, an entry on a résumé. We learn in passing that the government expropriated her family farm but not even what was grown there. We have no idea why she left to find her destiny in Mexico City, what her ambitions, hopes and fears might be.
A report in Variety on the backstory underlines this lacuna. Liboria Rodríguez, the director’s actual childhood nanny, it turns out, often talked to him “about her hardships as a girl, about feeling cold or hungry. ” She would tell about “her father, who used to play an ancient Mesoamerican ballgame that’s almost lost to the ages now, or about witch doctors who would try to cure people in her village. ”
'Roma' doesn't build bridges or tear down walls
Why did no such stories make it into “Roma”? Not for Cuarón’s lack of access to them. While filming, he called Rodríguez obsessively to check details. “He was getting all this information without me knowing what it was for,” she told Variety.
“Then it started to become weird,” she continued. He would ask, “Libo, what did you used to wear? How did you dress?” But he asked about externals, not concerns, ambitions, thoughts.
In short, the film is, indeed, “a personal epic. ” It's not about Cleo but the auteur behind the camera — his gratitude toward the nanny shown taking the future director to the cinema, his guilt about her subordinate position, his everything.
Why did so many critics laud “Roma”? Aside from waxing eloquent about its photography — “dynamically shot in a pellucid black and white,” Bradshaw writes, fairly enough — they seem to buy its conceit, holding up the indigenous in the abstract while merely glancing over indigenous peoples in concrete. It's an attitude not unlike that of the global upper middle-class toward poor immigrants.
When he won awards for best foreign-language film and best director at the Golden Globes, Cuarón said fine cinema “tears down walls and builds bridges” to other cultures: “We begin to understand exactly how much we have in common. ” But “Roma” does not build bridges to Cleo or tear down walls that separate her. It uses her to broadcast a story about upper-class Mexico.

Texto completo: Deciding what to bring with you to a tropical resort sounds simple. Swimsuits? Check. Cover-up? Check. Flip-flops? Check. But when the resort is an all-inclusive one -- think Sandals, Beaches and, of course, Club Med -- you may want to add a few extra items to your packing list. True, not having to carry cash or credit cards while you're there does make life easier, but you should be prepared for some quirks.
This is the gear Wirecutter's travel team packs when heading to an all-inclusive resort:
Hydro Flask 22-ounce Tumbler
All-inclusives often serve drinks in polystyrene cups -- pouring yours into an insulated tumbler will keep it cold and help you keep track of it, too.
Palau Short Fin Snorkel Set
Resorts usually provide snorkel equipment, but if you pack your own, you'll be sure it's clean, decent quality and that it fits you right.
Sea to Summit Lightweight 1L Dry Sack
A small watertight bag lets you bring your phone (or any small valuables) with you when you are playing in or on the ocean.
[Packing light? Here are Wirecutter's five carry-on essentials ]
Patagonia Lightweight Travel Tote
Carry your beach gear in a tote big enough to include the resort-issue beach towel -- though you may incur a fee if you don't return it.
Jabra Elite Active 65t
If the nonstop music playing at the pool isn't on your personal playlist, drown it out using a set of water-resistant Bluetooth headphones.
Thinksport SPF 50+ Sunscreen
Forgot bug spray? No problem, most resorts provide it. Sunscreen, though, they'll charge you for. Pack a few 3-ounce (TSA-friendly) tubes of reef-safe lotion.

Points to NYC in Amazon relocation

Texto completo: Imagine that a bunch of children are sitting around a table when a seemingly beneficent adult walks into the room carrying a plate of cupcakes. The kids burst out in excitement - until they notice a problem: There are fewer cupcakes than children.
At this point, the adult announces some ground rules. To receive a cupcake, the children will have to compete with one another. The adult will accept cash or other objects of value. Praise for the adult's kindness would also be welcome.
The kids immediately start saying nice things and digging into their pockets. But then one child has second thoughts. She quiets the room and tells the adult he's being a bully. He is bigger, stronger and richer than the kids, she says. He shouldn't make them grovel for cupcakes. The adult replies: "Fine. No cupcake for you."
If she were your child, how would you feel: proud that she took a stand, or disappointed that she didn't act in her own best interests? Cupcakes, after all, are pretty tasty.
New York recently became that disobedient child. The city damaged its own interests, or at least its short-term interests, for the sake of principle. Enough New Yorkers raised enough of a ruckus about the nearly $3 billion in tax breaks that the city and state were bestowing on Amazon that Amazon finally had enough. On Feb. 14, it announced that it would no longer be bringing 25,000 jobs to Queens. No cupcake for New York.
Yes, I know: Jobs are not cupcakes. Jobs help people build middle-class lives, which are in too short supply these days. So pretend that the adult in my story offered a Kindle instead of a cupcake. Or a college scholarship. It shouldn't change your view of the girl's rebellion.
Regardless, it's a version of what social scientists call "the tragedy of the commons" - in which people hurt their long-term interests by acting in their short-term interests. The only solution to the tragedy of the commons is to change the rules.
For years, companies have been getting the better of local governments - and taxpayers - by pitting them against one another. If a city or state won't pony up cash or tax breaks, companies threaten to go elsewhere. Boeing, Nike, Intel, Ford, General Motors, Foxconn, Royal Dutch Shell and many others have all done it. Since 1990, the combined size of these handouts has surged.
In the moment, the deals are often popular. Polls showed that most New Yorkers favored Amazon's plans for Queens. The editorial boards of both The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal criticized the politicians whose complaints scuttled the deal. The front page of The Daily News thundered, "AMAZON KILLERS: Shame on these so-called progressives for rejecting 25,000 high-paying jobs & billions in taxes tech biz would've brought to city."
The deal's supporters do make some good points. Amazon's critics have used silly anti-capitalist rhetoric at times. And the deal would have modestly helped the Queens economy (and only modestly: New York is home to more than 4 million jobs, and Queens to more than 1 million). But there is a larger picture here: Corporate-relocation subsidies are terrible policy.
They do nothing to lift the country's economic growth - to create more cupcakes, as it were. The subsidies mostly redistribute income upward, from taxpayers to corporate shareholders. If every city and state justifies big giveaways based on its own immediate interests, the tragedy of the commons will never end.
Somebody needs to make a principled stand. In New York, a coalition of activists and politicians did so. They called attention to the grubbiness and secrecy of these subsidies, which are, in their own way, anti-capitalist. The deal's collapse, Greg LeRoy, a longtime advocate on the issue, told Emily Badger of The Times, is "absolutely a godsend to those of us who have been trying to reform economic development."
For decades, local politicians have felt pressure on only one side of this issue: To do whatever it takes to attract companies. As a result, those politicians have contributed, often unwittingly, to the radical rise in economic inequality.
Amazon's messy departure from New York is a victory for the other side. It should remind politicians elsewhere that their private blandishments may later turn into public controversy. It should also remind politicians that they can say no. Northern Virginia gave Amazon much less money than New York but still won tens of thousands of new jobs.
And the whole episode should energize legal efforts to fight corporate handouts. Missouri and Kansas, for example, are talking about a "cease-fire" to keep local companies from playing the two states off each other. Officials in Arizona, Illinois, New York and several other states have talked about a multistate compact known as the End Corporate Welfare Act. The federal government, for its part, could offer financial incentives to states that refuse to play the handout game.
Yes, New York's economy will be slightly worse off because of Amazon's departure. But the city deserves our gratitude. Refusing to play an unfair game is sometimes better than winning it.

The Oscars show is shaping up as such a hot mess, we can't wait to see it

Texto completo: This year's Academy Awards offers all the traditional reasons to tune in: Glimpses of the world's biggest movie stars preening in couture gowns and borrowed diamonds. Great movies receiving the film industry's highest accolade. Soaring speeches. Stunning upsets.
But for the 2019 edition, there's an equally compelling reason to watch. It's the final chapter to the year's troubled, turbulent awards season. Live.
This Oscar season has been so fraught with missteps, backpedaling, Kevin Hart host-canceling, scandal, furor and controversy right up to this moment, that seeing it all come to a head-spinning conclusion in real time on television with a global audience is going to be a must.
All of that and Lady Gaga crooning "Shallow" with Bradley Cooper and Queen playing. I'm so there. With popcorn.
Kevin Hart out as Oscars host: Backlash from past homophobic tweets
Oscars costume party!: Get up close with iconic outfits from 'Black Panther,' 'Bohemian Rhapsody' and more
If Oscar producers Donna Gigliotti and Glenn Weiss can pull off this host-less, ever-changing show with moments of poignancy, emotion and intended humor, they're going to deserve an Emmy, a special Oscar and a guest appearance on "MacGyver. "
It's going to be compelling live television, no matter what.
Adweek reports that advertisers have snapped up the full allotment of commercial time, running at $2. 6 million for 30 seconds. Follow the money, because the people spending it know something.
Pulling off a host-less Oscars is the biggest hurdle and potentially most captivating scenario, bang at the show's beginning. It's like a figure skater stepping on the ice and attempting a triple axel jump.
In 2011, there was a host crisis when Eddie Murphy dropped out in November, before Billy Crystal rode in to save the day two days later. Still, many pondered if there would be enough time to pull off the show, which he did.
Hart flamed out of the host job in December following a furor over homophobic tweets revealed from his past. No one else wanted to step into the already thankless job, and the original idea of The Rock as host idea was genius, but he's busy.
The internet is so hungry for someone to fill the void that it's invented this scenario where Whoopi Goldberg, who's gone missing from "The View," is going to step in. Seriously? But wouldn't that be something?
The last time we didn't have a host for the Oscars was 1989 and the opening number featured the jaw-dropping scene of Rob Lowe dancing and singing with Snow White on a helium bender. Lowe is still banging his head against a wall about this.
Just seeing how the show's producers handle the lack of host and opening when confronted with this kind of history is going to be worth ensuring you're tuned in before the last A-lister waltzes off the red carpet into the Dolby Theatre.
Queen and Adam Lambert, whose performance was announced Monday with minimal ceremony and confirmed to USA TODAY as an opening act, could make people forget their host problem in one "We Will Rock You" stomp.
Then there's the other drama that's erupted this year around the major re-tooling of the show – revealing an energized, vocal (oh, and did we mention, very famous) Academy membership ready for some argy-bargy. Remember the "popular film" Oscar? That proposal was shot down faster than Greedo in "Star Wars. "
There have been other stands and hasty retreats by Academy officials. The decision that only two of the nominated songs would be performed – "Shallow" and Kendrick Lamar's "All the Stars" – led to more umbrage. The Academy flipped to allow all nominated songs to be represented, but wasn't able to secure Lamar's participation because he's out of the country and working on an album.
In another effort to cut down on the show's run time, the Academy decreed that four awards would be handed out during commercial breaks, then replayed during the broadcast in abbreviated form. Cinematography, film editing, makeup and hairstyling and live-action short took the hit, and the outcry was sustained – from Brad Pitt and George Clooney to Martin Scorsese and Quentin Tarantino.
Just two weeks before the telecast, the show's producers were told by Academy leadership that the show would be drastically changed once again by adding the awards back live.
“It would make for a good story if I had a nervous breakdown,” Gigliotti told The New York Times. “You find a new way. ”
Watching live awards shows, and live TV productions like "Grease Live," multiplies the thrills because there's no safety net. Right now, there are seasoned pros sweating through an already tricky show, one that's constantly changing in light of every new drama. They are so good that we usually only enjoy the slick product. But as Envelopegate showed us two years ago, when the wrong best-picture winner was announced, things can become regrettably, unforgettably unglued.
And who knows what other dramas will pop in the remaining time before the show finally starts. It's crunch time, and anything goes.
Awards audiences are already tough and have a chip on their shoulder after fights to preserve their show – with the wild card of President Donald Trump watching with his thumbs on Twitter as liberal Hollywood steps out.
Not to mention the surprises which will happen and unknowables which have happened before: a streaker, Neil Patrick Harris onstage in his underwear, Jennifer Lawrence tripping up the stairs to receive her award.
All of this is on top of the vivid plot lines which have emerged this awards season. Popular hits "Black Panther," "Bohemian Rhapsody," "A Star Is Born," and "Green Book" are in the running for best picture. And who the heck really knows who will win? Spike Lee could take home his first directing or best picture Oscar, Glenn Close could break her streak of being the most nominated living actress without a win. It goes on.
History of some sort will be made Sunday. The world waits.

Texto completo: Elizabeth Rowe, the principal flutist of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, has settled her pay discrimination lawsuit against the ensemble, bringing to an end a case that sparked international conversation about gender bias in classical music.
In her suit, filed last July, Ms. Rowe claimed that her compensation was only about 75 percent that of her closest comparable colleague, the orchestra's principal oboist, who is a man. It was one of the first complaints filed under a new law in Massachusetts that requires equal pay for "comparable work."
Ms. Rowe, who joined the orchestra in 2004, had sought more than $200,000 in unpaid wages. The amount of the settlement, which was reached on Feb. 14, was not disclosed.
In a joint statement both parties said they were "satisfied with the result," which included a pledge that the orchestra would "continue to collaborate with musicians, staff and other leaders in the field to accelerate the process of achieving gender parity."
The statement also paid tribute to Doriot Anthony Dwyer, a former principal flutist for the orchestra and "trailblazer" who joined the Boston Symphony in 1952, the same year that it became the first American orchestra, according to the statement, to use blind auditions, in which players are hidden behind a screen.
Ms. Dwyer, now 96, was one of the first woman to hold a principal chair in a major orchestra -- "a suitable achievement for a musician who traces her genealogy (and middle name) back to the suffragist Susan B. Anthony," The New York Times wrote in 1982.
Ms. Rowe and the orchestra pledged to build on the spirit behind practices like blind auditions, which have helped markedly increase the percentage of women in orchestras.
"In the same spirit of improvement and innovation it demonstrated more than six decades ago, the orchestra will continue to collaborate with musicians, staff, and other leaders in the field to accelerate the process of achieving gender parity," the statement said. "The B.S.O. and Elizabeth Rowe look forward to continuing their shared commitment to artistic excellence at the highest level."

Britain in the Crazed Brexit Vortex

Texto completo: LONDON -- Brexit. Brexit? Brexit! BREXIT!? The Backstop! Norway Plus! Canada Minus? The Cooper Amendment! The Malthouse Compromise? The Kyle-Wilson Amendment! Hard Brexit! Soft Brexit! No deal? Brexiteer! Remoaner! BREXIT!!?? Aaaargh.
It has come down to this with a few weeks to go until the March 29 deadline for Britain to leave the European Union, as it voted to do almost three years ago: a jumble of jargon, jousting and gibberish, with everyone sucked into the vortex of confusion, to the exclusion of every other issue in the world. Britain's biggest political parties are splintering, and there is clarity only on the fact that nobody has a clue what is about to happen.
So much for the panacea offered in 2016 by leaders of the Vote Leave campaign -- a land of milk and honey in which an island liberated from European shackles would become "Global Britain," money would flow, impetigo would be cured, children would become more beautiful, the soil more bountiful, and the world Britain's oyster. These days, the fantasy has sagged into a mumbled, "Well, Brexit is not the end of the world."
Not quite. "Leaving and going somewhere are not the same thing," Sam Gyimah, a Conservative politician who quit the government of Prime Minister Theresa May late last year in protest at her proposed accord with the 27-nation European Union, told me. "Nobody agrees on where we should go."
May's deal, overwhelmingly rejected by Parliament last month, is a fudge. It leaves the nature of Britain's future relationship with the European Union to be decided over the next two years. Everything -- the fate of the customs union, of the single market, of the Ireland-United Kingdom border -- remains unresolved under this proposal that May is now scrambling to rescue.
Article 7 of May's proposed agreement -- call it the disempowerment clause -- says that after March 29, European Union law "shall be understood as including the United Kingdom" except as regards "the participation in the decision making and governance of the bodies, offices and agencies of the Union." In other words, things remain as they are except that Britain loses "its voice, its vote and its veto," in Gyimah's phrase, as it embarks retrospectively on negotiating what its on-time exit from the union actually means.
"It would be the greatest voluntary transfer of sovereignty in memory," Pat McFadden, a Labour M.P. opposed to Brexit, told me.
So much for the "Take Back Control" slogan Brexiteers wielded in 2016 to foist every frustration of voters onto Brussels. In fact, the best the Tory government could come up with over negotiations consuming the entire political energy (and untold treasure) of this country is a kick-the-can measure designed to avert the calamity of a no-deal Brexit.
This, absent an accord or deferral, would involve Britain crashing out of the union on March 29 into a void. Bring it on! So say the hard-line Tories in May's party, their appetite for destruction not yet sated. Many of them are members of the European Research Group, an entity whose anodyne name masks its pro-Brexit zeal. It has apparently never heard of a multinational supply chain.
Honda's recent decision to close a plant in Swindon with the loss of 3,500 jobs -- unrelated, it says, to Brexit (ha-ha) -- and Nissan's recent retrenchment are signs, along with slower growth and lower investment, of the price Britain has already paid for uncertainty. No-deal Brexit would turn uncertainty into mayhem.
So May maneuvers to save her deal, chiefly by adjusting the "backstop," an insurance policy to preserve an open border in Ireland that has enraged hard-line Brexiteers because they see it as a Trojan horse for keeping Britain in the customs union through all eternity.
Jeremy Corbyn, the feckless Labour leader, maneuvers to keep his fingerprint off the British exit he not-so-secretly favors, while the majority of his party wants to remain in the European Union and eight M.P.s quit to form an independent group in Parliament to protest his policies.
Yvette Cooper, a leading Labour politician, pushes a bill to defer the March 29 deadline; and two other Labour M.P.s, Peter Kyle and Phil Wilson, have drawn up an amendment that would see the House of Commons approve May's accord on condition that it is put to a second referendum. (As for the Malthouse Compromise and forms of a soft or free-trade Brexit modeled on Norwegian or Canadian ties to the union, consign them, dear reader, to the vast T.M.I. Brexit archive).
The bottom line is simple: Brexit has been, is and will be a disaster for Britain. The 2016 vote was manipulated through lies. A country that has benefited from its 46-year participation in a union of more than a half-billion Europeans is drifting toward a self-amputation understood by few, opposed by the young, abetted by a dissembling anti-American Labour leader, driven by little-England Tory right-wingers holding the country for ransom, and, according to polls, no longer wanted by the majority.
Here are the odds in descending order of likelihood: An adjusted May accord secures parliamentary approval; the March 29 deadline is extended; no deal; a second referendum. Fight on! The best option, now that the country has sobered up, is to put Britain's real future to a second people's vote.

Texto completo: After an aide to Sen. Amy Klobuchar forgot to get her a fork with the salad he brought her on a flight, she scolded him and then ate the salad with a comb when the crew did not have any utensils on board.

When done eating, the Minnesota Democrat, who is running for president, made the staffer clean the comb she had brought with her in her bag, the New York Times reported Friday.

Accusations that Klobuchar has mistreated her staff have been piling up, starting days before she announced her bid for the Democratic nomination for 2020.

The Times report is the latest of several describing how she created a hostile work environment, sending degrading emails and berating staff for minor missteps. The reports said Klobuchar was known to throw office supplies when she became upset, and staffers were asked to wash her dishes or perform other chores, possibly violating Senate ethics rules.

Klobuchar, 58, acknowledged earlier this month she could be a “tough” boss.

“I am tough. I push people, that is true,” she told ABC’s “Good Morning America." “But my point is, is that I have high expectations for myself, I have high expectations for the people that work for me, and I have high expectations for this country.”

Her press secretary called some of the stories “just plain ridiculous.”

“The senator has repeatedly acknowledged that she can be tough and push people hard. But these anonymous stories — some of which are just plain ridiculous — do not overshadow the countless experiences of people on the senator’s team who she has been so proud to work with,” Carlie Waibel told the Times.

Texto completo: Benjamin B. Ferencz is now 98, but in "Prosecuting Evil: The Extraordinary World of Ben Ferencz," there's no sign that his passion has dimmed. In this documentary from the Canadian director Barry Avrich, he tells of how he emigrated to the United States from the tumult of Eastern Europe in the 1920s as a child and grew to become the chief prosecutor in the Einsatzgruppen case at the Nuremberg trials.
Ferencz was 27 when the case began and apparently not tall enough for the lectern without elevation. In the film's best stretches, he offers a detailed account of the proceedings and what followed, including his encounter with the convicted war criminal Otto Ohlendorf shortly before Ohlendorf's execution.
He also takes us through his post-Nuremberg work, such as how he used a set of bones from Auschwitz to persuade the German government to maintain the country's Jewish cemeteries in perpetuity and his advocacy for a permanent international criminal court. He explains how he and the Vietnam-era defense secretary Robert S. McNamara came to write an odd-couple Opinion article in The New York Times in 2000 urging Bill Clinton to sign the treaty creating that court, even though McNamara could have been one of the first defendants.
[Video: A preview of the film. Watch on YouTube.]
There is additional commentary from one of Ferencz's children, Don, and from notable legal figures like the Canadian Supreme Court justice Rosalie Abella. But the main interest lies with Ferencz himself, who comes across as thoughtful, principled and engaging in a film that, in keeping with his demeanor, is a modest profile rather than a sprawling portrait.
Not rated. Running time: 1 hour 23 minutes.

Shelf fulfilling: 5 book clubs that aim to foster friendship

Texto completo: When you're reading a great book, there's a special thrill to spotting it in the wild. At last! Please, person on the Metro, indulge in a lengthy, nuanced discussion about that thing the protagonist did in the final chapter. Washington's vast ecosystem of book clubs takes the chance out of such rare but satisfying encounters: Dozens of options can connect readers interested in every genre, from the classics to the classically criticized. Social groups are a hallmark of some of the region's indie stores, but for bookworms who forge their own path (and like the potential for more personal interaction), here are five local groups popular on the digital platform Meetup to consider joining this year:

Voracious: A Foodie Book Club If you devour your literature like you do finely cooked meals, Auja Little gets you. She launched her club a few years ago, inspired after reading "Voracious: A Hungry Reader Cooks Her Way Through Great Books," Cara Nicoletti's literary-themed cookbook. Each month, the group digs into a work that is, even peripherally, connected to food. Past selections include "The Edible Woman" by Margaret Atwood and "The Last Chinese Chef" by Nicole Mones. To be expected: Don't eat before the meetings. The club's 30-ish active members discuss each title at a restaurant that represents the plot or author; expect to deliberate over an Irish writer at an Irish pub, for example.

Nasty Women Bookclub In October 2016, then-presidential candidate Donald Trump called Hillary Clinton a "nasty woman." Hordes of feminists responded by adopting the phrase as a rallying cry, including Devin Flores, who co-founded this D.C. book club in early 2017. During its first year, the group - which quickly amassed more than 1,500 members - read titles off the New York Times bestseller list. The next year, members "took an overt feminist approach," Flores says, "and purposefully selected titles by women who were activists or known as feminists, or books with themes that lent themselves to that kind of conversation." To keep meetings small enough for engaging group dialogue, Flores caps attendance at 30 members via an online RSVP process. This upcoming year's reading list was culled from members' suggestions and includes "The Mere Wife" by Maria Dahvana Headley (February); "Women, Race & Class" by Angela Davis (March); and "Paradise" by Toni Morrison (April). Plan to discuss them over a couple of glasses of champagne.
The Sci-Fi and Fantasy Book Club If you crave stodgy, pretentious literary critiques, Vijay Paradkar warns, this probably isn't the group for you. His club meets twice monthly, once to discuss a fantasy selection - alternating between traditional and urban/contemporary fantasy - and again to review a classic or modern sci-fi title. Planned reads for February are "The Queens of Innis Lear" by Tessa Gratton and "Semiosis" by Sue Burke. Paradkar, who's been running the group since 2011, particularly loves the sense of community: Members have discussed more than 200 books together, plus "watched movies, thrown Halloween parties and karaoke nights, attended conventions, taken trips and raised around $58,000 for charity." Seems worth beaming into.

Books You Should Have Read in High School Book Club LuJack Martinez's club delivers a do-over for anyone who missed out on the classroom-favorite classics. "I thought, well, I can dwell in my regret, or I can do something about it," says Martinez, who launched the group when he moved to the capital from California about a year ago. The February selection was "1984" by George Orwell, followed by Louisa May Alcott's "Little Women" in March and Aldous Huxley's "Brave New World" in April. Martinez sends discussion questions to group members ahead of each meeting and draws on his background leading Bible studies to oversee what he describes as lively, productive conversations. The meetups, at District restaurants, have drawn readers ranging in age from their early 20s to their mid-70s.

Smart Women, Trashy Romance Novels Rabeeta Farooque used to conceal the covers of the romance novels she read in public; one never knows when a judgy literary critic is hovering nearby. Since launching Smart Women, Trashy Romance Novels a year ago, however, she's owned her affection for the genre. Yes, they're quick, light reads; no, that doesn't mean "bad." Farooque has cultivated a 200-reader-strong club that convenes monthly after reading a novel of each member's choosing that fits certain criteria; last month, for example, they discussed regency romances over high tea. The group analyzes hot topics that overlap with the genre, such as dubious sexual consent and racism, and hosts fun competitions: Bring the most ridiculous romance cover, the most outrageous passage, the best euphemism for the, uh, male sword.

Pittsburgh Opera’s ‘Glory Denied’ tells POW’s story

Texto completo: Pittsburgh Opera's "Second Stage" productions of new operas, which account for one of the six operas it stages each season, fulfill one of the company's most vital missions.
We love the old operas that dominate programming everywhere because of their great music serving universal themes. Contemporary opera has the advantage of addressing issues of our own lifetime.
To that end, Pittsburgh Opera will present "Glory Denied" by Tom Cipullo in a Second Stage production Feb. 23 to March 3 at its Pittsburgh headquarters.
The opera is based on the book "Glory Denied" by Thomas Philpott, which tells the story of Jim Thompson, an American hero who was the longest held American prisoner during the Vietnam War. The late Sen. John
McCain, also a prisoner of war after his plane was shot down, wrote the introduction to the book.
Cipullo discovered "Glory Denied" while working at the famous McDowell Colony for artists when he read a New York Times book review. He wanted to write an opera and sensed the potential of Thompson's story. After ordering and reading the book he became convinced it would be his first opera.
The composer is 62 and says the Vietnam era is part of his formative years.
"I wanted to tell that story. I wanted to reenact the most important parts of the story. Those were less about Col. Thompson's family and more about the time in which he lived and how the nation changed from 1964 to 1973," he says.
Nearly all the words of the libretto are the actual words of the real people. But to convey how the life in the U.S. changed during the Vietnam War, Cipullo wrote the words to one number. He called it a "Catalog Aria," a nice allusion to one of the many famous excerpts from Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's "Don Giovanni," which will open Pittsburgh Opera's 2019-20 season.
Cipullo says it was great fun to think about and write an aria which includes Teflon cookware, men with long hair, stay-pressed shirts and miniskirts.
"Young people don't realize how much our country changed in those years," he says. "If you look at high school year books in 1964, all the boys are in jackets and ties and have short hair. Yearbooks from 1973 look like it's a different planet with the counter-culture and doing your own thing. I think Col. Thompson must have felt he came back to Mars when he returned in 1973."
The opera is in two acts: In Captivity and Welcome Home, and lasts about 70 minutes. "Welcome Home" is an ironic title, because Thompson was only known to be missing in action and his wife Alyce had moved on to another man. Thompson and his wife are the opera's only characters, with different singers for the two acts.
Baritone Ben Taylor will play Thompson in Act II, which he says is a "blast to perform." He learned his part in the opera first, then read the book for nuances of characterization.
"To act this role in a way that's truthful to the person and story and be dramatically engaging is tough," Taylor says. "The singing part is very difficult as far as memorizing and getting it into your body. But I will give Cipullo credit that, as a great composer would, he gives the singer the tools (in the music itself) to learn it."
"Glory Denied" has been a big success for Cipullo, with more than 20 productions since 2007 and four more set for next season. He praises Pittsburgh Opera for its presentation of contemporary operas.
"Who's to say," asks Cipullo, "opera can't have a new golden age in America in the 21st century?"

BUSINESS BEAT; Bank pondered delaying Trump loans' due dates; Deutsche fretted about a default by a president but decided against an extension.

Texto completo: Top Deutsche Bank executives were so concerned after the 2016 U.S. election that the Trump Organization might default on about $340 million of loans while President Trump was in office that they discussed extending repayment dates until after the end of a potential second term in 2025, according to people with knowledge of the discussions.
Members of the bank's management board, including then-Chief Executive John Cryan, were leery of the public relations disaster they would face if they went after the assets of a sitting president, said the people, who asked for anonymity because the discussions were private. The discussions were about risks to the bank's reputation and did not relate to any heightened concerns about the creditworthiness of Trump or his company, the people said.
The bank ultimately decided against restructuring the loans to the Trump Organization, which come due in 2023 and 2024, and chose instead not to do any new business with Trump while he is president, one of the people said.

A spokesman for Deutsche Bank declined to comment, and the people with knowledge of the discussions said they didn't know why the bank ultimately decided not to extend the loans. The White House didn't respond to requests for comment.
"This story is complete nonsense," Eric Trump, a son of the president and an executive vice president of the Trump Organization, said in an email. "We are one of the most under-leveraged real estate companies in the country. Virtually all of our assets are owned free and clear, and the very few that do have mortgages are a small fraction relative to the value of the asset. These are traditional loans, no different than any other real estate developer would carry as part of a comparable portfolio."
Deutsche Bank had been Trump's go-to lender for decades, even as other commercial banks stopped doing business with him because of bankruptcies. Although the German lender's investment bank had severed ties with Trump during the financial crisis, after he defaulted on a loan and then sued the bank, its wealth management unit continued to extend him credit.
But, as the New York Times first reported, Deutsche Bank had already turned down a request for a loan from the Trump Organization for work on a Scottish golf course in early 2016, during the campaign, in part because of concern that it might have to collect from a sitting president.
The head of the retail bank at the time, which includes the wealth management unit, was Christian Sewing, who replaced Cryan as CEO in April. Sewing initially backed the loan application, but he submitted it to Deutsche Bank's reputational risk committee, which recommended turning it down, according to a person familiar with the matter. Sewing supported the decision, the person said. The Trump Organization said it never sought such a loan.
The Deutsche Bank debt includes $125 million for the Trump National Doral Miami resort, which matures in 2023, according to federal records and mortgage documents. The company also owes $170 million for the Trump International Hotel in Washington and has another loan against a Chicago tower, both of which come due in 2024.
Trump's dealings with Deutsche Bank are facing heightened scrutiny now that Democrats are in control of the House of Representatives and two party members -- Californians Maxine Waters and Adam Schiff -- are sitting at the top of powerful committees.
Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee have already described in detail what they want from Deutsche Bank.
In a March report, they said they would seek to interview senior executives in the bank's risk division who could tell them about due diligence conducted on Trump after the 2016 election. They also want documents about the bank's earlier transactions with Trump and would like to interview his personal banker, Rosemary Vrablic.
In the four years before his election, Trump borrowed more than $620 million from Deutsche Bank and Ladder Capital to finance projects in Manhattan, Chicago, Washington and near Miami, federal documents and property records show.
Jack Weisselberg, a top loan-origination executive at Ladder, is the son of Allen Weisselberg, the Trump Organization's longtime chief financial officer who previously worked for President Trump's father, Fred.
Ladder lent Trump $282 million for four Manhattan properties, records show. Jack Weisselberg declined to comment. The loans are split between variable-rate and fixed-rate mortgages. Some are interest-only loans, with balloon payments due at maturity, according to property records and securities filings.

Texto completo: President Trump said Wednesday he instructed Secretary of State Mike Pompeo not to allow an Alabama woman to return to the U.S. after she joined the Islamic State.


Pompeo said earlier Wednesday that Hoda Muthana would not be allowed to return to the U.S. because she is not a citizen, does not have a valid passport, or any visa to travel to the U.S.

According to the New York Times, Muthana had an American passport when she left the U.S. for Turkey and was smuggled into Syria more than 4 years ago.

Her family and her Tampa-based lawyer insist she was born in Hackensack, N.J., in 1994.

Trump’s order comes days after demanding that European countries repatriate and put on trial hundreds of ISIS fighters who have been captured in Syria as the U.S. prepares to withdraw its troops from the country.

“The United States is asking Britain, France, Germany and other European allies to take back over 800 ISIS fighters that we captured in Syria and put them on trial. The Caliphate is ready to fall. The alternative is not a good one in that we will be forced to release them,” Trump wrote in a tweet Saturday.

“We do so much, and spend so much - Time for others to step up and do the job that they are so capable of doing. We are pulling back after 100% Caliphate victory!” he said.
Tweet
Europe has so far been reluctant to take back their citizens over potential legal challenges.

Muthana surrendered last month with her young son and has been held in a detainee camp in northeastern Syria.

“I realized how I didn’t appreciate or maybe even really understand how important the freedoms that we have in America are. I do now,” she wrote to her lawyer. “To say that I regret my past words, any pain that I caused my family and any concerns I would cause my country would be hard for me to really express properly.”

NYT publisher blasts Trump's 'dangerous' rhetoric used by 'dictators,' 'tyrants'

Texto completo: The publisher of the New York Times shot back at President Trump on Wednesday after he called the Times the "enemy of the people."

“The phrase ‘enemy of the people’ is not just false, it’s dangerous. It has an ugly history of being wielded by dictators and tyrants who sought to control public information,” A.G. Sulzberger said in a statement.

Earlier Wednesday morning, Trump tweeted that the Times was the “true ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE,” the day after the outlet reported the president was susceptible to accusations of obstruction of justice for his attacks on special counsel Robert Mueller’s probe into Russian involvement in the 2016 presidential race.

“Through 33 presidential administrations, across 167 years, The New York Times has worked to serve the public by fulfilling the fundamental role of the free press,” Sulzberger said in his statement.

Trump has long attacked media for being “fake news” in response to negative coverage of himself and his administration, and has ratcheted up the rhetoric by calling the press the “enemy of the people."

“As I have repeatedly told President Trump face to face, there are mounting signs that this incendiary rhetoric is encouraging threats and violence against journalists at home and abroad,” Sulzberger said.

One week ago a man wearing a "Make America Great Again" hat attacked a BBC cameraman at a Trump rally in Texas in what was just the latest instance of violence towards members of the media.

Sen. Bernie Sanders says he's running for president in 2020

Texto completo: WASHINGTON (AP) - Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders said Tuesday that he will seek the Democratic presidential nomination again, a decision that will test whether he can still generate the progressive energy that fueled his insurgent 2016 campaign.
"Our campaign is not only about defeating Donald Trump," the 77-year-old self-described democratic socialist said in an email to supporters. "Our campaign is about transforming our country and creating a government based on the principles of economic, social, racial and environmental justice."
An enthusiastic progressive who embraces proposals such as "Medicare-for-all" and free college tuition, Sanders stunned the Democratic establishment in 2016 with his spirited challenge to Hillary Clinton. While she ultimately became the party's nominee, his campaign helped lay the groundwork for the leftward lurch that has dominated Democratic politics in the Trump era.
The question now for Sanders is whether he can stand out in a crowded field of Democratic presidential candidates who also embrace many of his policy ideas and who are newer to the national political stage. That's far different from 2016, when he was Clinton's lone progressive adversary.
Still, there is no question that Sanders will be a formidable contender for the Democratic nomination. He won more than 13 million votes in 2016 and dozens of primaries and caucuses. He opens his campaign with a nationwide organization and a proven small-dollar fundraising effort.
"We're gonna win," Sanders told CBS.
He said he was going to launch "what I think is unprecedented in modern American history": a grassroots movement "to lay the groundwork for transforming the economic and political life of this country."
Sanders described his new White House bid as a "continuation of what we did in 2016," noting that policies he advocated for then are now embraced by the Democratic Party.
Trump told reporters that Sanders ran a great campaign in 2016 but that he believes the senator "missed his time."
"I like Bernie," Trump said, noting Sanders' criticism of free trade. "The problem is he doesn't know what to do about it. We're doing something very spectacular on trade."
Sanders goes into the campaign with several advantages, including the name recognition he earned from his last run. In a sign of the enthusiasm surrounding his campaign, Sanders raised $4 million on Tuesday from nearly 150,000 individual donors.
California Sen. Kamala Harris raised $1.5 million in the first 24 hours of her campaign. She was previously the biggest fundraiser in the race.
Sanders could also be well-positioned to compete in the nation's first primary in neighboring New Hampshire, which he won by 22 points in 2016. But he won't have the state to himself.
Harris was in New Hampshire on Monday and said she'd compete for the state. She also appeared to take a dig at Sanders.
"The people of New Hampshire will tell me what's required to compete in New Hampshire," she told shoppers at a bookstore in Concord. "But I will tell you I'm not a democratic socialist."
Sen. Elizabeth Warren of nearby Massachusetts will be in New Hampshire on Friday.
One of the biggest questions surrounding Sanders' candidacy is how he'll compete against someone like Warren, who shares many of his policy goals. Warren has already launched her campaign and has planned an aggressive swing through the early primary states.
Shortly after announcing her exploratory committee, Warren hired Brendan Summers, who managed Sanders' 2016 Iowa campaign. Other staffers from Sanders' first bid also have said they would consider working for other candidates in 2020.
The crowded field includes other candidates who will likely make strong appeals to the Democratic base including Harris and Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Kirsten Gillibrand of New York. The field could grow, with a number of high-profile Democrats still considering presidential bids, including former Vice President Joe Biden and former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke.
While Sanders had been working to lay the groundwork for a second campaign for months, it was unclear whether he will be able to expand his appeal beyond his largely white base of supporters. In 2016, Sanders notably struggled to garner support from black voters, an issue that could become particularly pervasive during a primary race with several nonwhite candidates.
Last month, he joined Booker at an event in Columbia, South Carolina, marking Martin Luther King Jr. Day. In 2016, Sanders lost the South Carolina primary, which features a heavily black electorate, by 47 points.
Sanders also faces different pressures in the #MeToo era. Some of his male staffers and supporters in 2016 were described as "Bernie bros" for their treatment of women.
In the run-up to Sanders' 2020 announcement, persistent allegations emerged of sexual harassment of women by male staffers during his 2016 campaign. Politico and The New York Times reported several allegations of unwanted sexual advances and pay inequity.
In an interview with CNN after the initial allegations surfaced, Sanders apologized but also noted he was "a little busy running around the country trying to make the case."
As additional allegations emerged, he offered a more unequivocal apology.
"What they experienced was absolutely unacceptable and certainly not what a progressive campaign - or any campaign - should be about," Sanders said Jan. 10 on Capitol Hill. "Every woman in this country who goes to work today or tomorrow has the right to make sure that she is working in an environment which is free of harassment, which is safe and is comfortable, and I will do my best to make that happen."

How bad is Disney's 'Aladdin' blue Genie problem after the Will Smith reveal tanked?

Resumen: Disney unveiled Will Smith's very blue Genie from 'Aladdin' at the Grammy Awards. Now that the howling has subsided, how bad is the situation?

Enlaces: https://upfinder.upf.edu/openurl/34CSUC_UPF/34CSUC_UPF:VU1?genre=article&amp;atitle=How+bad+is+Disney%27s+%27Aladdin%27+blue+Genie+problem+after+the+Will+Smith+reveal+tanked%3F&amp;author=Alexander%2C+Bryan&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;date=2019-02-20&amp;rft.btitle=&amp;rft.jtitle=USA+Today+%28Online%29&amp;issn=&amp;isbn=&amp;sid=ProQ%3Anorthcentralnews_

Texto completo: If Walt Disney Studios and director Guy Ritchie were granted three wishes, one of them would surely be that Will Smith's Genie in the live-action "Aladdin" would find a little love.
So far, there's been overwhelming vocal consternation over the pivotal character in the remake that flies into theaters May 24.
It was always going to be a bumpy ride for anyone stepping into the curled genie shoes after Robin Williams voiced his iconic, exhilarating role in 1992's animated "Aladdin. "
Fans rejoiced when the Genie-less first teaser arrived last October. "I fangirled so hard . . . It looks so good!" one tweeted. "I'm legit over here sobbing," another wrote. But the very blue unveiling of Smith's Genie in a Grammy Awards telecast "special look" was skewered on social media.
The New York Times' Kyle Buchanan feverishly led the tweeted criticism, including, "They premiered this image at night??? We are supposed to sleep after this???"
We could go on about the chorus of social media barbs, which became such a thing that John Oliver used the blue Genie image as a punchline on "Last Week Tonight," comparing it to the looming "disaster" when Britain leaves the European Union.
"You know how Twitter is. There’s a pitchfork army out there and they all join in. And right now, Will Smith’s blue Genie is out in front of this army, in a negative way," says Jeff Bock, senior box-office analyst for Exhibitor Relations. "The Genie just looked odd. And while it's called 'Aladdin,' all the attention since Robin Williams' role is focused on the Genie. "
First photo: The Internet is fixated on Will Smith's Genie, and not in a good way
The backlash: Twitter rips Will Smith's 'too blue' Genie after 'Aladdin' trailer airs
Disney wouldn't comment on the marketing aspects of the film, which has stoked excitement with fans who made 2016's live-action "The Jungle Book" a major hit. The studio stood behind its Genie in a statement to USA TODAY: “We have one of the most anticipated films of the year and are confident that audiences will fall in love with the Genie and all of the characters when it hits the big screen this May. ”
Bringing out the Will Smith Genie, and the blue, has been a slow, deliberate rollout for Disney after two teaser trailers – as if to ease fans into the full live-action blueness against the formidable history of Williams' cartoon creation.
In December, a smiling Smith was unveiled on the cover of Entertainment Weekly, minus his CGI blue coloring. After fans reacted badly, the star assured them on Instagram, "I’m gonna be BLUE! :-) This is how the Genie is in Human / Disguise Form. "
They didn't know how blue.
However awkward the first look, the negative reaction shouldn't be a surprise, according to director Raja Gosnell, who unveiled his own bright blue update of beloved animated characters in 2011's live-action "The Smurfs. "
"We didn’t have the Twitter world back then that we have now, thank God. But that unveiling was met with levels of horror and gnashing of teeth by the online community," says Gosnell. "There is always going to be some sort of outcry by the keyboard warriors. It was going to be the same thing with the blue Genie from 'Aladdin. ' "
"The Smurfs" went on to find its audience, make $563. 7 million in the worldwide box office, and Gosnell brought the live-action creations brought back for a 2013 sequel, "The Smurfs 2. "
But there are many voices who contend Disney missed the vital opportunity to make a strong first impression that Smith's Genie could hold his own against Williams' legacy.
Paul Michael Glaser conceptualized and directed 1996's "Kazaam" around 7-foot-1 superstar center Shaquille O'Neal. While the fantasy musical was disparaged by critics, visualizing Shaq as a genie was spot-on casting.
Glaser says the decision to depict Smith as blue and physically pumped up, like a live-action version of Williams' character, wasn't "a smart thing to do. "
"Making him blue was a bit of cop-out. But even more than that was the big, muscular look makes this Genie more comparable to the animated version. Why does a Genie have to be all of that?" says Glaser.
He would have preferred seeing more of what the superstar leading man could bring. "They missed the boat in terms of trying to really explore what it would be like to rub a bottle and have Will Smith come out of it," says Glaser.
Smith has made clear he will make the part his own in the final film, which EW described in the first look story as “part Fresh Prince, part Hitch. " Smith, who acknowledged he was "terrified" to go up against Williams' "iconic" role, said in the piece his character was "different enough and unique enough that it would be in a different lane. "
There's still time for the formidable Disney marketing machine, with the powers of charismatic PR power player Smith, to right the spilled bottle.
"Disney has its own magic lamps," says Bock. "And 'Aladdin' is fortunate to pretty much own Memorial Day weekend for family entertainment. So it's in good shape there. "
Part of the marketing blitz will include a full trailer, which still hasn't been released yet. Perri Nemiroff, senior producer of movie site Collider. com, suggests "scaling back on Genie in the marketing, that might be the smartest move after what we've seen. "
The emphasis could focus on other "Aladdin" aspects such as Mena Massoud as Aladdin, Naomi Scott as Jasmine and their adventure story.
Then Smith will have an entire movie to unfurl his full Genie.
"I just want to see Will Smith own that look and make that role his own," says Nemiroff. "I'm hoping my optimism will not be misplaced. "
Randall Jaynes, who has made a career as a deep-hued member of Blue Man Group and is now its artistic director, believes people will come to love this Genie and his vibrant coloring.
"You could already hear this Genie is Will Smith. It had his jingle and pizzazz, but the color is so evocative, it changed the look. Of course, people are going to get used to it," says Jaynes. "Welcome, Will Smith: Blue is a wonderful world to be in. "

"We're gonna win," Sanders told CBS.

He said he was going to launch "what I think is unprecedented in modern American history": a grassroots movement "to lay the groundwork for transforming the economic and political life of this country."

Sanders described his new White House bid as a "continuation of what we did in 2016," noting that policies he advocated for then are now embraced by the Democratic Party.

Trump told reporters that Sanders ran a great campaign in 2016 but that he believes the senator "missed his time."

"I like Bernie," Trump said, noting Sanders' criticism of free trade. "The problem is he doesn't know what to do about it. We're doing something very spectacular on trade."

Sanders goes into the campaign with several advantages, including the name recognition he earned from his last run. In a sign of the enthusiasm surrounding his campaign, Sanders raised $3.3 million on Tuesday from 120,000 individual donors, according to a person familiar with the campaign who wasn't authorized to publicly disclose the early numbers and spoke on condition of anonymity.

That's more than double the $1.5 million haul Sen. Kamala Harris raised in the first 24 hours of her campaign. The California Democrat was the biggest fundraiser in the race so far.

Sanders could also be well-positioned to compete in the nation's first primary in neighboring New Hampshire, which he won by 22 points in 2016. But he won't have the state to himself.

Harris was in New Hampshire on Monday and said she'd compete for the state. She also appeared to take a dig at Sanders.

"The people of New Hampshire will tell me what's required to compete in New Hampshire," she told shoppers at a bookstore in Concord. "But I will tell you I'm not a democratic socialist."

Sen. Elizabeth Warren of nearby Massachusetts will be in New Hampshire on Friday.

One of the biggest questions surrounding Sanders' candidacy is how he'll compete against someone like Warren, who shares many of his policy goals. Warren has already launched her campaign and has planned an aggressive swing through the early primary states.

Shortly after announcing her exploratory committee, Warren hired Brendan Summers, who managed Sanders' 2016 Iowa campaign. Other staffers from Sanders' first bid also have said they would consider working for other candidates in 2020.

The crowded field includes other candidates who will likely make strong appeals to the Democratic base including Harris and Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Kirsten Gillibrand of New York. The field could grow, with a number of high-profile Democrats still considering presidential bids, including former Vice President Joe Biden and former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke.

While Sanders had been working to lay the groundwork for a second campaign for months, it was unclear whether he will be able to expand his appeal beyond his largely white base of supporters. In 2016, Sanders notably struggled to garner support from black voters, an issue that could become particularly pervasive during a primary race with several nonwhite candidates.

Last month, he joined Booker at an event in Columbia, South Carolina, marking Martin Luther King Jr. Day. In 2016, Sanders lost the South Carolina primary, which features a heavily black electorate, by 47 points.

Sanders also faces different pressures in the #MeToo era. Some of his male staffers and supporters in 2016 were described as "Bernie bros" for their treatment of women.

In the run-up to Sanders' 2020 announcement, persistent allegations emerged of sexual harassment of women by male staffers during his 2016 campaign. Politico and The New York Times reported several allegations of unwanted sexual advances and pay inequity.

In an interview with CNN after the initial allegations surfaced, Sanders apologized but also noted he was "a little busy running around the country trying to make the case."

As additional allegations emerged, he offered a more unequivocal apology.

"What they experienced was absolutely unacceptable and certainly not what a progressive campaign -- or any campaign -- should be about," Sanders said Jan. 10 on Capitol Hill. "Every woman in this country who goes to work today or tomorrow has the right to make sure that she is working in an environment which is free of harassment, which is safe and is comfortable, and I will do my best to make that happen."

Texto completo: A Republican political strategist said that the Democrats demise in 2020 will be caused by the progressive faction of the party.

“Democrats seem to have responded to the election of Mr. Trump not by pushing forward sensible, moderate candidates who understand the fundamentals of government and policy but rather far-left legislators in Congress and policy like the late-term-abortion laws in Virginia and New York,” Liz Mair wrote in a New York Times opinion article.

She specifically mentioned that recently elected Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., and Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., helped push the party further left and from party line-skirters.

She claims that those initially opposed to Trump are considering voting for him in 2020 as the Democratic Party pushes further left, and says the "Never Trump" Republican movement is “no longer playing much of a role in the actual biosphere.”

Mair says that Republicans who opposed Trump in 2016 are now supporting him in 2020 after wins on tax reform, regulation rollbacks, undermining the Affordable Care Act, and big executive appointments, especially in the Supreme Court and federal judiciary.

“Those things matter to lots of different types of conservatives, and some of them matter in particular to social conservatives,” Mair wrote. “That leaves relatively few of us undecideds pacing the proverbial political mall, window shopping. Our efforts to affect the 2020 map might just be pointless.”

Even though Mair said that she sees "Never Trumpers" leaning toward voting for Trump in 2020 as they are disillusioned with the Democratic Party, she says she will likely back William Weld, the lone Republican who announced he would be challenging Trump in the Republican primaries.

Bless CBS’s Lara Logan for calling out liberal media bias

Enlaces: https://upfinder.upf.edu/openurl/34CSUC_UPF/34CSUC_UPF:VU1?genre=article&amp;atitle=Bless+CBS%26rsquo%3Bs+Lara+Logan+for+calling+out+liberal+media+bias&amp;author=Hillyer%2C+Quin&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;date=2019-02-19&amp;rft.btitle=&amp;rft.jtitle=Washington+Examiner&amp;issn=&amp;isbn=&amp;sid=ProQ%3Asoutheastnews_

Texto completo: Serious praise should go to the famously brave CBS reporter, Lara Logan, for telling the truth in a recent interview, in saying that the media both nationally and internationally is hideously biased leftward.

“The media everywhere is mostly liberal,” Logan told podcaster Mike Ritland, citing her 30 years in professional journalism. “In this country, 85 percent of journalists are registered Democrats …. I always joke that another 14 percent were too lazy to register, and that there’s maybe one percent that is on the Right.”

She continued: “Visually, anyone who’s ever been to Israel and been to the Wailing Wall has seen that the women have this tiny little spot in front of the wall to pray, and the rest of the wall is for the men. To me, that’s a great representation of the American media, is that in this tiny little corner where the women pray you’ve got Breitbart and Fox News and a few others, and from there on, you have CBS, ABC, NBC, Huffington Post, Politico, whatever, right? All of them. And that’s a problem for me.”

The bias is nothing new, Logan said, but the standards of professionalism have dropped precipitously:

“Although the media has always been historically always been left-leaning, we’ve abandoned our pretense, or at least the effort, to be objective today ... That means we’ve become political activists in a sense and, some could argue, propagandists — and there’s some merit to that.”

Logan elaborated on these points at considerable length, and with considerable thoughtfulness and insight, even while acknowledging that being so forthright might be “professional suicide for me.”

This is important. Journalists on the Right surely can all tell of conversations with supposedly mainstream or “establishment” media figures who admit a liberal bias in the profession, but who say it is benign. The establishmentarian will say something along the lines of, “well, journalism just attracts people who care about fairness and social justice and who are compassionate, whereas conservatives care more about making money. But because we [the liberals] are committed to the truth, that means we’re fair to everybody.”

Note the assumptions that liberals are morally superior and conservatives are greedy. Well, when that is your bias going in, how can you possibly be fair to conservatives, whom you think are your moral inferiors? The bias itself blinds those establishmentarians to the harmful effects their bias produces.

Case in point: The Feb. 17 New York Times “news” article headlined — I’m not kidding — “Republicans hope to sway voters with labels that demonize Democrats.” Seriously.

Question: In the past 60 years, has the Times ever run a piece whose theme is that Democrats are trying to “demonize” the poor, victimized Republicans?

By this telling, Republicans are “unusually aggressive … meant to strangle … mischaracterize legislation backed by Democrats… caricaturing [Speaker Nancy Pelosi].” Meanwhile, the poor abused Democrats, apparently correctly (according to the tone of the piece), “see an insidious effort to use women and minorities, especially women of color, as the new symbols of the radical ‘other.’”

And so on, and on, and on, and on. Democrats are saints. When they push socialism, anti-Semitism, and abortion up to the moment of birth, they are merely misunderstood. Republicans, however, are evil, attempting to demonize and "other-ize" them.

If you missed that subtext, context, and conclusion in this “news” article, then you can’t read.

Lara Logan is correct, and the media outlets who pretend she’s wrong are either dishonest or hypocritical or both. And if this little column is “demonizing” the establishment media...well, so be it. Some demons are real.

New York Times makes 'obstruction of justice' case against Trump while admitting there's 'no evidence' in long report

Texto completo: An extensive New York Times story published Tuesday purports to take you “inside” President Trump’s “Two-Year War on the Investigations Encircling Him.” But save yourself the precious time and read Trump’s tweets instead.

The news out of the lengthy piece is an allegation that Trump late last year asked then-acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker if it was possible to appoint U.S. Attorney General for Southern New York Geoffrey Berman, a White House ally, to lead the district’s investigation into Trump’s former personal lawyer Michael Cohen, who pleaded guilty in November to charges of perjury, tax evasion, and campaign finance violations.

The Times reported that Whitaker “knew he could not put Mr. Berman in charge, since Mr. Berman had already recused himself from the investigation” and admitted that “there is no evidence that he took any direct steps to intervene in the Manhattan investigation.”

That’s the extent of news in the story, which otherwise recounts everything Trump has said on Twitter or in news interviews — that he was disappointed with former Attorney General Jeff Sessions recusing himself from the Russia probe, that he thought ridding himself of former national security adviser Michael Flynn and former FBI Director James Comey would quell the investigation, and that he believes there are conflicted elements at the highest levels of the DOJ working against his presidency.

The Times report asserts that Trump's conduct has "exposed him to accusations of obstruction of justice," but Trump has made all of his thoughts on all of his actions public over the course of more than a year, and the Times didn’t change anything by repeating it.

The article is an excellent source of information, however, if you want to know what mood Trump was in during any number of private conversations with his advisers.

McCabe's depiction of Jeff Sessions is pathetically unbelievable

Texto completo: Former acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe is having his moment in the sun, trying to sell a book making explosive allegations — but he undermines the believability of any of it by his outlandishly embittered descriptions of former Attorney General Jeff Sessions.

As a New York Times review of McCabe’s new book describes it, Sessions comes across as “openly racist,” with (now using McCabe’s own words) “trouble focusing” while “lacking basic knowledge.” In sum, reviewer Dwight Garner says that “the portrait of Sessions is of a man for whom merely ordering lunch seems to be above the timberline of his intellect and curiosity.”

This is sheer calumny and utterly unbelievable. On the racism charge — based not on alleged remarks about black Americans but about Irish-American FBI agents — my colleague James Gagliano has it right: “It defies credulity that any modern AG would ever utter such blatantly racist remarks around anyone — much less the acting director of the FBI.”

It especially defies credulity considering Sessions’ own background of being blocked for a judgeship, and almost blocked from becoming attorney general, because of now-widely-discredited allegations of racism. Even if Sessions looked at the world through a racial lens, which he doesn’t, he’s not stupid enough to go around expressing it.

That supposed stupidity described by McCabe, though, is even more absurd. Allow, please, some directly personal observations. I live in Mobile, where Sessions lives. I’ve covered him closely for local and national publications for 21 years. I’ve had numerous in-depth conversations with the man, both on the record and off. The off-the-record ones, including several airport lunches when we found ourselves on the same flights between Mobile and the nation’s capital, were especially illuminating, because they involved Sessions at his most unguarded. They also showed him at his best and most thoughtful.

Because they were off the record, I would not divulge (nor do I specifically remember) the exact substance of what we discussed, but I certainly can relay impressions.

When he didn't need to worry about parsing every word on the record, Sessions did not become less admirable but more so. The less he relied on talking points, the more keenly intelligent he sounded. He would discuss copious details of whatever we spoke about, whether it was national issues, occurrences in Mobile, or news about mutual acquaintances. He cares deeply about issues and people, and he clearly does his homework with vigor.

The idea that he would ignore key briefings, fail to understand basic Justice Department jurisdictional questions, or, Lord forbid, make sweeping generalizations about various ethnicities, is ludicrous.

But there's more: These descriptions of Sessions come from a man, McCabe, not only with an axe to grind against Sessions (who fired him), but who also has been identified by the independent Justice Department inspector general as having lied three times under oath. Sessions is far more credible than McCabe.

I reached out to a trusted observer who worked with Sessions for the first time at the Justice Department — thus, someone without longstanding ties to Sessions and no evident “dog in the hunt.” Because of the obviously complicated cross-currents at the department, the source quite reasonably asked for anonymity.

“The idea of Sessions ever saying a disparaging thing about anyone in law enforcement is laughable” said the source. “The idea that he confided this idea, that no one else has ever heard him say, to Andy McCabe? A guy he never liked or trusted? I don’t think so. ... Andy should have picked something more believable to lie about.”

Exactly.

Kaiser Permanente to open medical school in Pasadena, offer free tuition for first classes in 2020

Texto completo: Kaiser Permanente is opening a hospital-run school of medicine in Pasadena, announcing Tuesday, Feb. 19 it would waive tuition for its first five graduating classes in an attempt to jump-start medical careers minus the typical crushing student debt.
The Kaiser Permanente School of Medicine said it has received preliminary accreditation and will begin accepting applications from prospective students in June for admission in the summer of 2020.
This will be a unique learning institution for Kaiser, which plans to waive all tuition for the full four years of school at its campus at 98 S. Los Robles Ave. Those classes — with 48 students each — will run from 2020 through 2024.
Tuition would typically cost $55,000 a year, saving each student $275,000.
“This is primarily about making sure all students, regardless of backgrounds, aren’t deterred from pursuing a career in medicine due to the prospect of going into massive debt,” said Kaiser spokesman Vincent Staupe. “This is also about wanting students to be able to choose a medical specialty that they are truly passionate about, rather than choosing one based solely off financial need.”
Kaiser hopes the strategy will prompt more students to pursue lower-paying specialties in the primary care field, or work in under-served areas since they wouldn’t be burdened with overwhelming debt.
The school will use a “small-group, case-based medical curriculum” that are designed to prepare future physicians to become collaborative leaders committed to prevention, fluent in data-driven care and adept at addressing the needs of under-served patients and communities.
Dr. Mark A. Schuster, the school’s founding dean and CEO, said the health care giant is developing a school committed to providing “outstanding patient care in our nation’s complex and evolving health care system.”
The school said it has recruited a diverse group of leaders with vast health care experience who, in turn, created a curriculum that includes three academic pillars — foundational science, clinical science and health systems science.
The school’s clinical education will take place primarily in Kaiser Permanente hospitals and clinics in the greater Los Angeles area and in partnered community health centers.
Other medical schools at universities have taken steps recently to decrease their students’ financial burden. Columbia University, for example, is using a $250 million gift for a new endowment that will fund a range of scholarships and grants meant to ensure none of its medical students incur debt.
About three-quarters of medical school students graduate with debt, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges; members of the 2017 graduating class who had debt reported a median amount of $192,000.
Kaiser’s medical school has received preliminary accreditation from the Liaison Committee on Medical Education, a different process than usual because, unlike the universities that open medical schools, it is not already a degree-granting institution.
The New York Times contributed to this report.

Texto completo: Kaiser Permanente is opening a hospital-run school of medicine in Pasadena, announcing Tuesday, Feb. 19 it would waive tuition for its first five graduating classes in an attempt to jump-start medical careers minus the typical crushing student debt.
The Kaiser Permanente School of Medicine said it has received preliminary accreditation and will begin accepting applications from prospective students in June for admission in the summer of 2020.
This will be a unique learning institution for Kaiser, which plans to waive all tuition for the full four years of school at its campus at 98 S. Los Robles Ave. Those classes — with 48 students each — will run from 2020 through 2024.
Tuition would typically cost $55,000 a year, saving each student $275,000.
“This is primarily about making sure all students, regardless of backgrounds, aren’t deterred from pursuing a career in medicine due to the prospect of going into massive debt,” said Kaiser spokesman Vincent Staupe. “This is also about wanting students to be able to choose a medical specialty that they are truly passionate about, rather than choosing one based solely off financial need.”
Kaiser hopes the strategy will prompt more students to pursue lower-paying specialties in the primary care field, or work in under-served areas since they wouldn’t be burdened with overwhelming debt.
The school will use a “small-group, case-based medical curriculum” that are designed to prepare future physicians to become collaborative leaders committed to prevention, fluent in data-driven care and adept at addressing the needs of under-served patients and communities.
Dr. Mark A. Schuster, the school’s founding dean and CEO, said the health care giant is developing a school committed to providing “outstanding patient care in our nation’s complex and evolving health care system.”
The school said it has recruited a diverse group of leaders with vast health care experience who, in turn, created a curriculum that includes three academic pillars — foundational science, clinical science and health systems science.
The school’s clinical education will take place primarily in Kaiser Permanente hospitals and clinics in the greater Los Angeles area and in partnered community health centers.
Other medical schools at universities have taken steps recently to decrease their students’ financial burden. Columbia University, for example, is using a $250 million gift for a new endowment that will fund a range of scholarships and grants meant to ensure none of its medical students incur debt.
About three-quarters of medical school students graduate with debt, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges; members of the 2017 graduating class who had debt reported a median amount of $192,000.
Kaiser’s medical school has received preliminary accreditation from the Liaison Committee on Medical Education, a different process than usual because, unlike the universities that open medical schools, it is not already a degree-granting institution.

Texto completo: Times Insider delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how news, features and opinion come together at The New York Times.
When we began investigating McKinsey & Company, the consulting firm with the golden pedigree, we knew how difficult it would be. McKinsey had built itself into the world's most influential consultancy, not only by hiring smart Ivy League students, but also by keeping its most sacred promise: secrecy. For 92 years, the firm has held fast to the dictum of never disclosing names of clients or the advice it gives.
We were intrigued by a company that seemed to be everywhere -- and nowhere at the same time. As a private company, it had no obligation to report information to the public. And as a consulting company, it wasn't regulated. Other types of companies, especially accounting firms and investment banks, have similar client rosters, but they are overseen by government agencies. This lack of accountability, particularly for a firm as influential as McKinsey, beckoned us to dig deeply into its conduct around the world.
The most basic question we set out to answer was this: Did McKinsey's pristine reputation as the foremost purveyor of "best practices" match its record? After nearly a year of reporting, we found that the answer was often no.
That point was driven home in startling fashion when we recently reported that the Massachusetts attorney general had accused McKinsey of fanning the flames of the opioid epidemic. In legal papers, the attorney general alleged that McKinsey had instructed the maker of a powerful opioid on how to "turbocharge sales" of the drug, how to counter efforts by drug enforcement agents to reduce opioid use and how to "counter the emotional messages from mothers with teenagers that overdosed" on the drug.
Despite McKinsey's refusal to allow its employees to speak freely with us, we managed to contact and interview 44 current and former McKinsey employees around the world, often using encrypted forms of communication. As part of our research, we traveled to South Africa, Ukraine, Austria and Guernsey in the Channel Islands.
Michael Forsythe, who has reported extensively in China, used his deep knowledge of that nation's government, language and social media to help build a custom database tracking McKinsey's work in that country. As a result, we were able to report that McKinsey had advised 22 of the 100 largest state-owned enterprises, including one that built the artificial islands in the South China Sea, a major point of military tension with the United States.
Just one week after the United Nations denounced the mass detention of thousands of ethnic Uighurs in a vast archipelago of indoctrination camps, McKinsey chose to quietly hold its annual corporate retreat nearby. We not only reported on that retreat, in Kashgar, China, we also published pictures of it, including one that showed red carpets winding through the desert. Under the headline "How McKinsey Has Helped Raise the Stature of Authoritarian Governments," we also documented the firm's work in Russia, Ukraine and Saudi Arabia. McKinsey's work in these countries is noteworthy because it comes at a time when democracies around the world are under attack.
Much of our reporting relied on McKinsey's own words, memorialized in a medium the firm has mastered: the PowerPoint slide.
One slide, made for Boeing, became the basis for an entire article involving the aircraft maker, a Ukrainian oligarch, Indian titanium and possible bribery. Another slide deck, uncovered by our colleague Katie Benner, identified social media accounts of three prominent online critics of the Saudi government. One was subsequently arrested.
Today's article focuses on McKinsey's hedge fund, MIO Partners. Like McKinsey itself, it is highly secretive, a point reinforced during our visit to an offshore tax haven where MIO conceals some of its money. No one from the fund was willing to speak to us, though we did talk to two former executives. The $12.3 billion fund is coming under increasing scrutiny because McKinsey sometimes consults or advises companies where MIO has a financial stake.
There is more to report on this influential company. If you have a McKinsey story you would like to share with us, please let us know.

Socialism has already hurt America

Texto completo: President Donald Trump was principled and politically astute to address, in his State of the Union, the horrors taking place now in Venezuela, and then to declare:
"Tonight we renew our resolve that America will never be a socialist country.
Venezuela is indeed a poster child for what happens when a nation's economic machinery falls under political control.
Over the last five years, per The Wall Street Journal, Venezuela's economy shrank by 35 percent and poverty tripled from 48 to 87 percent.
According to Gallup, 71 percent of Venezuelans say they can't afford food, 47 percent say they can't afford shelter, just 15 percent say they are satisfied with the availability of quality health care, and 35 percent say they are satisfied with their standard of living.
Thirty-six percent of Venezuelans, 51 percent of those between 15 and 29, say they would leave the country permanently if they could.
But if it is so clear that socialism is a formula for economic disaster, why does the idea still conjure up support?
In a Gallup poll of last year, 57 percent of Democrats, compared to 16 percent of Republicans, say they have a "positive view of socialism.
Economist and New York Times columnist Paul Krugman says it's semantics.
Krugman mocks Trump, saying that "there is essentially no one in American political life who advocates such things as government control of industry, as is the case in Venezuela.
When Democrats say "socialism, says Krugman, they really mean "social democracy - a market economy with a social safety net and use of the tax system as an equalizer.
The issue really isn't how we technically define socialism. The issue is really the extent to which we are free.
What difference is it really if a firm is privately owned, but the government has vast latitude to regulate what it does? Or if a private firm pays me but government taxes away a large chunk of what I earn?
Venezuela is, of course, the extreme case. Total collapse as result of political despots taking over everything.
But socialism is not like good wine, which, in moderation, might not hurt and might even be beneficial.
Every step in which economic freedom is cut back bears costs.
We see what is happening now, as the U.S. economy surges back to life as a result of cutting back regulation and taxes.
But our nation has not totally escaped the Venezuelan phenomenon.
America has entire communities in distress for the same reasons that Venezuela has fallen apart - political control over economic affairs. Life in our poor communities is in the grip of socialism, not capitalism.
Government housing, government health care, government schools, government welfare programs.
There are 31 million people living in areas of high economic distress, now designated as "opportunity zones. The average poverty rate in these zones is 28.7 percent. The average household income is 40 percent below the national average, and 36.5 percent of prime-age adults are not working. Fifty-six percent of these 31 million are non-white minorities.
The president's new opportunity zone initiative, providing tax incentives to direct investment capital into these neighborhoods, aims to change realities with the same passion that the president spoke against socialism for the rest of the country in his State of the Union address.
How do countries wind up going in the wrong direction?
British playwright George Bernard Shaw captured it when he said, "A government that robs Peter to pay Paul can always depend on the support of Paul.
Political demagogues tap into the frustrations of those who are struggling, or tap into the ambitions of those who long for power, and sell them Hollywood dreams - and lies - of a better life. Once they convince them to turn over power, the nightmare begins.
Life has no shortcuts. Freedom, hard work and personal responsibility are the one and only path to prosperity.

An Eye for Dignity in the Famous and the Unknown

Texto completo: The images Ozier Muhammad saw in Life magazine growing up in Chicago during the 1960s inspired him to become a photographer.
They were of his family and their friends.
Mr. Muhammad is the grandson of Elijah Muhammad, a founder of the Nation of Islam, the religious group that was often in the news because of its two highest-profile adherents, Malcolm X and Muhammad Ali.
"I grew up in a community that was either revered or reviled," said Mr. Muhammad, 68. "I saw a lot of pictures published at the time of the Nation because of Malcolm. There was so much coverage because of Malcolm in the early to mid-60s, and Gordon Parks came into our community and documented it. He documented my grandfather Elijah and his inner circle, who were some tough characters. These were people I knew intimately, and Gordon Parks had photographed them. They were really incredible pictures. I wanted to understand and learn more."
The jazz-loving teenager forgot about his dreams of playing trumpet and embraced photography. His career took him from working for Jet and Ebony magazines to newspapers, including Newsday, where he shared the 1985 Pulitzer Prize for international reporting on the African drought, and, finally, The New York Times, where he covered Nelson Mandela's electoral victory in 1994 and the 2010 Haitian earthquake before retiring in 2014.
A retrospective exhibit, "A Life in the World: Bearing Witness With a Camera From the South Side of Chicago to South Africa," is now at New York's Interchurch Center Galleries through Feb. 22. His images span continents, feature the famous and the unknown, and capture moments of joy or drama, united by a commitment to portraying people with dignity and respect.
A chance meeting with an art director for the Johnson Publishing Company, which dominated the African-American market, led him to freelance for them. He was eventually hired on staff, going from Hollywood to Africa, photographing celebrities, artists, politicians and newsmakers.
He went to Tanzania in 1974 for the Sixth Pan-African Congress, a gathering of the African diaspora started by W. E. B. Du Bois. Meeting figures like C. L. R. James, the Trinidadian anticolonial writer and historian, reaffirmed his approach.
"I wanted to be a witness to people who were trying to improve the conditions of African people throughout the world," he said. "To be in Tanzania on my first trip to Africa at a time when Tanzania was considered the ideal in Africa because of the leadership of Julius Nyerere. He was Mandela before Mandela became the leader of South Africa."
His concern for how people of color were represented shaped how he covered disasters. During his 1984 reporting trip to Mali, Burkina Faso and Ethiopia, he explored the drought's devastating impact. Covering Haiti's earthquake, he was unsettled by scenes of death. He carefully figured out how to portray a horrific event without pictures of corpses.
"There seems to be some racial imbalance when it comes to covering people of color in that situation as opposed to covering folks who were killed in Paris," he said. "You just don't see something comparable in white enclaves."
On the other end of the emotional spectrum, he considers his coverage of South Africa's first free elections in 1994 an indelible experience.
"I felt like I was a part of it," he said. "These are my brothers and sisters, too, and we were one large family. That might not be a good thing for a journalist to feel, but we share things in common besides skin color. We are people who have been oppressed and subjected to the worst horrors human beings can be subjected to. This was a moment of redemption."
Since leaving the paper, he has devoted himself to his other passions: music and Harlem. Given his neighborhood's transformation, he is taking stock of its future.
"My pictures look like architectural relics," he said. "I'm glad I was able to spend that much time in Harlem because it is a community that lost its distinct African-American cultural signature. It hasn't quite settled into what it's going to become."
In the meantime, he can be spotted at jazz concerts, where he still finds inspiration.
"I look at the musicians and think about the skills they have and their musicality, using their instruments and making musical expression with a high degree of excellence," he said. "That's translatable. It's not exclusive of any other form of artistic expression. I couldn't be Miles Davis, as my trumpet teacher told me after 12 lessons. Well, I was not going to be a dog-ass photographer. I will try to hone my skills to be as good as I possibly can."

Can Bernie Sanders do better with black voters in 2020?

Texto completo: Shortly after Senator Bernie Sanders suffered a crushing loss in South Carolina's Democratic primary in 2016, his campaign's African-American outreach team sent a memo to top campaign leaders with an urgent warning.
“The margin by which we lost the African-American vote has got to be — at the very least — cut in half or there simply is no path to victory," the team wrote in the memo, which was reviewed by The New York Times. Sanders had won 14 percent of the black vote there compared with 86 percent for Hillary Clinton, according to exit polls.
Over seven pages, the team outlined a strategy for winning black voters that included using social media influencers and having Sanders give a major speech on discrimination in a city like St. Louis or Cincinnati.
Sanders's inner circle did not respond.
As Sanders prepares to announce another run for the White House as early as this week, his weak track record with black voters — a vital base in the Democratic Party — could be a potential threat to his candidacy.
Dissatisfaction among black staff members on the 2016 campaign was reported at the time, including by Fusion. But fresh interviews show that many former black employees still feel frustrated that they were not taken seriously or provided the resources they needed to succeed, even though some continue to admire Sanders.
Sanders appears committed to strengthening ties with the black community since his loss to Clinton.
He has made multiple trips to the South, and last month he spent Martin Luther King Day in South Carolina, where he spoke at the Capitol and met with black leaders, elected officials, and students.

Disgraced former congressman Anthony Weiner has been released from federal prison after being convicted of having illicit online contact with a 15-year-old girl in 2017.
The Federal Bureau of Prisons website shows the 54-year-old New York Democrat is currently in the custody of its Residential Re-entry Management office in Brooklyn.
It's not immediately clear when Weiner was transferred and where he's staying now, but Weiner will have to register as a sex-offender and spend three years on supervised release under the terms of his sentence.
The prison bureau, federal prosecutors in New York, and Weiner's lawyer didn't respond to e-mails seeking comment Sunday.
Weiner began serving a 21-month prison sentence at the Federal Medical Center Devens, located in Ayer, in November 2017.
The bureau website shows Weiner is slated to complete his sentence May 14, a few months earlier than scheduled because of good conduct in prison.

Ex-Maine governor spent $22K on Trump hotel stays
Documents obtained by a Maine newspaper show the state's former Republican governor and his staff spent at least $22,000 in public money at a hotel owned by the family of President Trump.
The Portland Press Herald reported Sunday that former governor Paul LePage and staff paid for more than 40 rooms at Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C., over a two-year period. The newspaper reported that documents it obtained show the administration paid from $362 to more than $1,100 a night for rooms at the luxury hotel when in D.C. to meet with Trump or conduct other business.

Trump says he found 'real Collusion' — in 'SNL' skit
President Trump has gotten ahead of Special Counsel Robert Mueller III's investigation, making one thing clear: There was collusion.
Well, on "Saturday Night Live," at least.
In a Sunday morning tweetstorm, Trump blasted the previous night's episode of "SNL," which opened with Alec Baldwin portraying the commander-in-chief declaring a national emergency at the southern border — and quickly drew fire from the ACLU and Baldwin himself.
And, like before, Trump said without much explanation that the show is a coordinated attempt by NBC at character assassination.
"Nothing funny about tired Saturday Night Live on Fake News NBC! Question is, how do the Networks get away with these total Republican hit jobs without retribution?" Trump said on Twitter. "Likewise for many other shows? Very unfair and should be looked into. This is the real Collusion!"
Mueller's investigation and recent court decisions have found that at least four former Trump aides allegedly have lied about contacts with Russians during the 2016 election.
"SNL's" skit skewered Trump's Friday news conference: "Wall works, wall makes safe," Baldwin-as-Trump said. "You don't have to be smart to understand that — in fact, it's even easier to understand if you're not that smart."
That apparently got under Trump's skin, as Baldwin's performances often have.

Texto completo: html> There's no question that this is the biggest transitional season in Jim Pohlad's time as owner of the Twins.
He will have a new manager in Rocco Baldelli who is the first one hired from outside the organization since Ray Miller came from the Orioles in the middle of the 1985 season. Miller lasted part of two seasons before being replaced by Tom Kelly.
The team also is dealing with low attendance. The past five seasons, in which the Twins have had three losing years including 78-84 in 2018, they have combined to average 25,790 fans per game, after getting 35,943 fans per game the first four seasons at Target Field.
And there's no doubt that playing without Joe Mauer means the team has to have other players step up, and the fact that Pohlad signed off on contract extensions for shortstop Jorge Polanco and outfielder Max Kepler shows that the owner is ready to have a new group take over the club.
So is Pohlad still excited to be owner of the club after a decade?
"Everybody likes to be involved with sports [ownership] and baseball in particular," said Pohlad, whose father, Carl, died 10 years ago. "This time of year there are 30 optimistic teams. We're one of them. It's fun."
As for the Twins' expectations, Pohlad said: "I don't want us to be a team that always defies expectations. So if expectations are high we go low, and if they're low we go high. But that is kind of the way it has been so far.
"We have high expectations for the team, we do this year. We hope they come to fruition."
Asked for his early impressions of Baldelli, hired to replace Paul Molitor, Pohlad has liked what he has seen.
"We're hearing a lot about this right now, that people connect quickly to Rocco, and that is the way it was for me," he said. "I participated in the interview for a handful of candidates, but the connection with Rocco was immediate."
Moving forward from Mauer
Is he worried about getting fans to the ballpark without Mauer?
"I don't want to say it will be terrible, because I love Joe Mauer, but everything moves on," Pohlad said. "His life has progressed. He's gotten older, like I have. You just have to accept change when it comes."
And while there was never a question of the Twins spending money with Mauer's big $23 million deal on the books, he did say that going forward it doesn't mean the team is going to spend thoughtlessly.
"We definitely have payroll flexibility, but it's not like there is some requirement that we have to spend the money," he said. "We will if it can be proven and it's the recommendation of Derek Falvey and Thad Levine."
How does Pohlad feel his baseball operations team of Falvey and Levine has done entering their third season?
"We're committed, and we understand all of this is a long-term process," Pohlad said. "It's not about hiring a magician or magicians and they come in and perform a magic trick that brings in world championships. It's a long process, and you build for the long term."
Pohlad said he recognizes how Falvey, Twins chief baseball officer, and Levine, the general manager, are changing the team's baseball operations from top to bottom.
"It is a change from the prior group of people that was here, there is no doubt about that," he said.
Pohlad admitted he does not have much insight on the technological changes the team is implementing. "But I know they are utilizing technology, and that is an investment," he said. "Besides people, it is an investment in software that we have made, also."
Target Field still improving
When the funding was approved for Target Field, Pohlad told me a new stadium on its own would not bring fans out over the long term. The Twins needed to win.
And that has proved to be true the past few years with Twins attendance dropping during some tough seasons.
Still, Pohlad said the ballpark is a night-and-day difference from the Metrodome, even as it enters its 10th season of operation.
"I mean it's a great place to watch baseball, compared to the Metrodome," he said. "There were a lot of great memories, but it's like watching something in black and white versus in color."
And how about the changes at Target Field coming this year, with the new juniper plants on the center field backdrop and the big increase in space for the main entrance off Target Plaza?
"It has been almost 10 years now, and you start to see things that you start to think about replacing things, because nothing lasts forever," Pohlad said. "But our goal is to keep in pristine condition at all times."
Still, he knows that when it comes to increasing attendance in 2019, it's all about winning.
"We're not happy, that is for sure," Pohlad said. "I get it, people want to come and want a winning team, and we do, too."
Sid Hartman can be heard on WCCO AM-830 at 8:40 a.m. Monday and Friday, 2 p.m. Friday and 10:30 a.m. Sunday. • shartman@startribune.com
Attendance concerns
Attendance numbers have steadily fallen since Target Field opened in 2010. The Twins hope to keep those numbers from dipping below 24,000 fans per game for the first time since 2002 at the Metrodome.

• Gophers football coach P.J. Fleck recently talked about how transfers Micah Dew-Treadway and Gervarrius Owens can help the team immediately: "Dew-Treadway, the defensive tackle from Notre Dame, will help us and he will play. We get him for one year and maybe, hopefully, for two. … Owens is a guy we signed and we have him for three years, which is really good because we need some depth in the secondary."
• Former Gophers coach Jerry Kill was named the athletic director at Southern Illinois on Thursday. He was the acting AD since April 2018. That promotion couldn't have happened to a better or more deserving person.
• The New York Times ran a story last week about Sports Reference, which operates many popular statistical websites including Baseball Reference. The story quoted Twins GM Thad Levine, who noted the team hired Hans Van Slooten away from the company to be a baseball systems operator last year.
• Timberwolves rookie Josh Okogie took part in the NBA Rising Stars Game on Friday after his best game as a pro in Wednesday's 121-111 victory over Houston. Okogie had 16 points, three rebounds, four assists, two steals and a block. "We saw him grow up in a lot of ways," interim coach Ryan Saunders said. … All-Star Karl-Anthony Towns scored 19 of his 25 points in the second half of that game, shooting 10-for-12 from the floor and 3-for-4 from three-point range. He added nine rebounds, five assists and a pair of blocked shots. … Maybe Andrew Wiggins, who missed the victories over the Clippers and Rockets because of illness, should come off the bench and be successful like Taj Gibson has the past couple of games.
• The Gophers really miss point guard Nate Mason, who was recently claimed by the Texas Legends of the NBA G League. In two games, Mason has averaged 4.5 points, 3.5 rebounds, 2.0 assists and 2.0 steals.

TRUMP'S EMERGENCY LEAVES REPUBLICAN SENATORS IN BIND

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., spent the last two weeks hammering out a deal on federal spending and border security with colleagues from both parties, reassured by a sense that Congress was finally asserting itself as a civil, stabilizing force.
The feeling did not last. On Friday, President Donald Trump mounted one of the most serious executive branch challenges to congressional authority in decades, circumventing Congress with an emergency declaration. It would allow him to unilaterally divert billions of dollars to a border wall and presented his Republican allies on Capitol Hill, who labored on a legislative compromise, with the excruciating choice of either defending their institution or bowing to his whims.
The president's move left Senate Republicans sharply divided, and it remains to be seen whether they will act collectively to try to stop Mr. Trump or how far into uncharted territory they are willing to follow a headstrong president operating with no road map beyond his own demands.
"With him you always have to expect the unexpected," said Ms. Capito, speaking on the phone from her kitchen in Charleston, W.Va., exhausted from a week of late-night talks at the Capitol.
The Republican resistance to Mr. Trump's emergency declaration was much more pronounced in the Senate than in the House, where a few Republicans - in the minority but more closely aligned to Mr. Trump - groused. But most of the conservative rank and file embraced it.
After threatening to kill the spending compromise needed to keep the government open, Mr. Trump opted to cite a national emergency to pry loose additional funding to build a wall longer than the 55 miles in the bipartisan agreement. It was the divisive step that Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., the majority leader, Ms. Capito and most other Republicans in the Senate had forcefully urged him not to take, because it would establish a precedent they feared future Democratic presidents would use against them.
The decision left Mr. McConnell, a professed guardian of the Senate's prerogatives and power, joining with Mr. Trump in supporting an executive branch end run greater than any of the incursions into the legislative process he often accused President Barack Obama of pursuing. Fellow senators said Mr. McConnell, a former member of the Appropriations Committee, was unhappy with the declaration, but saw it as the only way to pass the spending bill.
Some top Republicans, led by Mr. McConnell, pivoted quickly to say they supported the president's action because it was the only option left to him after Congress failed to meet his demands for wall funding. Mr. McConnell has even begun offering the president strategic advice on how best to push his plan, aides said.
But Mr. McConnell is also warning Mr. Trump of the damage it could inflict on the party heading into the 2020 elections. Other Republicans portrayed it as a gross violation of the constitutional separation of powers, a blatant disregard by the president for Congress' fundamental role in determining how federal dollars are spent.
"He is usurping congressional authority," Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, a veteran member of the Appropriations Committee, said in an interview. "If the president can reallocate for his purposes billions of dollars in federal funding that Congress has approved for specific purposes and have been signed into law, that has the potential to render the appropriations process meaningless."
Several other Senate Republicans publicly and privately joined Ms. Collins in describing the move as a flagrant breach of congressional jurisdiction and a dangerous precedent. Their numbers raised the clear possibility that enough Republican defectors could join with Senate Democrats to provide a majority to disapprove of the president's decision should the opportunity arise.
Four Republicans might be enough to join with Senate Democrats and pass legislation rebuking the president, and leadership aides put the number of potential defectors as high as 10. But the unrest seemed well short of the sort of partywide revolt necessary to override a veto by Mr. Trump of any legislative attempt to prevent his declaration of an emergency, leaving a legal challenge as the only recourse.
"I would not vote for disapproval," said Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., the Appropriations Committee chairman who led the spending negotiations. "He's got the power to defend the country, to defend the borders, to protect the people as commander-in-chief. I believe the courts would uphold him on this."
Despite reservations about many of the actions taken by Mr. Trump and the White House over the past two years, most congressional Republicans have been reluctant to put too much distance between themselves and the president given his grip on Republican voters, many of whom consider the wall a national necessity. Mr. Trump exerts a powerful hold on his party, and lawmakers are cowed by the belief that opposing him will end in their political destruction.
Still, the emergency declaration was a direct assault on the ability of lawmakers themselves to restrain the president, and it raised expectations that more could balk at what was widely viewed as a serious case of executive overreach.
"Somebody is going to have to say enough is enough," said Trent Lott, the former Senate leader from Mississippi, who questioned the wisdom of the move.
Even those senators who said they were willing to abide by the president's decision did so grudgingly, acknowledging that it was a bad way to govern and could have significant consequences.
"I don't see anything that necessarily violates the law, but that is a very different question from whether we should be doing it," said Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, a conservative known for his view that Congress has handed over too much power to the executive branch.
Democrats were united in their condemnation, accusing Mr. Trump of claiming a false crisis because he could not win over Congress with his argument. They said the president was so desperate to build the wall as a difficult re-election campaign loomed that he was willing to shred the Constitution to do so.
"The president's actions clearly violate the Congress's exclusive power of the purse, which our Founders enshrined in the Constitution," House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said in a statement. "The Congress will defend our constitutional authorities in the Congress, in the Courts, and in the public, using every remedy available."
Most notably, Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Schumer said, "We call upon our Republican colleagues to join us to defend the Constitution."
Ms. Pelosi's office is in the process of amassing a list of nearly 400 projects nationwide that could be jeopardized by the diversion of funds to construct a border wall, the Hill reported.
"It is inconsistent with the U.S. Constitution because, after the American Revolution against a king, our founders chose not to create a chief executive with the power to tax the people and spend their money any way he chooses," said Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn.
"This is a fundamental constitutional responsibility of Congress," said Ms. Collins. "We should be opposing this strongly."
Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., who faces a re-election race next year, suggested it would be hypocritical for Republicans to support the emergency declaration after criticizing Mr. Obama for "executive overreach." He warned that future Democratic presidents might follow Mr. Trump's precedent.
"I don't believe in situational principles," he said.
A day after Mr. Trump declared a national emergency the legal challenges came almost immediately.
On Friday, the advocacy group Public Citizen filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Washington, seeking to block Mr. Trump's declaration on behalf of three Texas landowners and an environmental group.
Another advocacy group, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, sued the Department of Justice on Friday for failing to provide documents - including legal opinions and communications - related to the president's decision to declare a national emergency.
California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, a Democrat, said he planned to work with other states to take legal action against the White House. The American Civil Liberties Union said it was preparing a lawsuit for early next week, arguing that Mr. Trump cannot legally redirect taxpayer money during an "emergency" unless it's for military construction projects that support the armed forces.
The issue was more than a constitutional discussion for Republicans in Congress. Democrats signaled that they would proceed with a privileged resolution of disapproval that would force GOP lawmakers to vote for Mr. Trump's wall or oppose his emergency claim - with certain political repercussions.

Texto completo: During the recent partial government shutdown, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi repeatedly called President Donald Trump's demand for $5.7 billion in border-wall funding a "nonstarter." Those of us shivering in the extreme cold in the Midwest and Northeast at the time immediately thought of the nonstarters in our driveways and garages - ice-encrusted vehicles that emitted only the whine of the starter motor - or dead silence - when we turned the key.
In fact, this term originated not with automobiles but with horses. The Oxford English Dictionary traces its first appearance in print to 1865, when it was used to describe a horse unable to start in a race. We still deploy this original meaning when we talk about "starters" and "nonstarters" on sports teams. The first metaphorical use of "nonstarter" to mean "something that has no chance of being accepted or successful" came in this sentence from a 1942 British book: "That is one reason why non-intervention is such a non-starter."
The popularity of the term in Britain grew gradually during the 1950s and then got a jump start during the 1960s from "University Challenge," a TV quiz show in which teams from British colleges competed. The show's original emcee, the delightfully named Bamber Gascoigne, began each round by announcing, "Starter, for 10 points," and would occasionally describe a subsequent question as a "nonstarter."
We Yanks, who are always eager to import trendy Briticisms, began deploying the term metaphorically during the 1970s. The earliest American use in a political context that I could find came in a New York Times column by John P. Lewis on Dec. 9, 1971: "The premise of undivided Pakistan's sovereign integrity . . . has been a nonstarter."
The two spellings "non-starter" and "nonstarter" have coexisted peacefully for decades; Brits tend to prefer the hyphenated version, Americans the non-hyphenated. My recent N-gram search for the word worldwide revealed that "nonstarter" has been gaining on "non-starter" in recent years and is now used about 60 percent of the time.
"Nonstarter" is certainly not the most elegant word, and, like its fellow negatives "no-brainer," "no-nonsense" and "no-frills," has become a cliche. But it's less clunky than its synonyms "no-go," "dud" and "loser." So, if you're trying to convey the idea that something is D.O.A, "nonstarter" is probably a good place to . . . well, start. Thank you, Bamber!

Texto completo: Contemporary stars gather to pay tribute to Elvis on NBC. And "Last Week Tonight" returns to HBO.
What's on TV
ELVIS ALL-STAR TRIBUTE 9 p.m. on NBC. In December 1968, a tan, leather-clad Elvis Presley slinked onto American TV screens in what has become known as the "'68 Comeback Special," a TV performance that helped resuscitate the singer's career at a time when bands like the Beatles and the Rolling Stones had largely eclipsed him. This special gathers together a satisfyingly varied group of performers to pay tribute to the King. Among them are: Jennifer Lopez, who will perform a cover of "Heartbreak Hotel"; Ed Sheeran, performing "Can't Help Falling in Love"; Shawn Mendes, singing "Hound Dog"; John Legend performing "A Little Less Conversation"; Carrie Underwood and Yolanda Adams doing a medley of gospel songs once sung by Presley; and Keith Urban singing "It's Now or Never" with Post Malone.
THE NUN'S STORY (1959) 8 p.m. on TCM. Audrey Hepburn plays the privileged daughter of a famous surgeon in this Fred Zinnemann-directed movie, which delivered Hepburn an Academy Award nomination. Her character's transformation into her life as a nun is the focus of the story, which was adapted from a novel by Kathryn Hulme. "To characterize this handsome picture as a conventional drama or romance or perhaps as an odd adventure story is a perilous thing to do, for it doesn't fit any category in an easy and obvious way," Bosley Crowther wrote in his 1959 review for The New York Times. He said that the movie delivers Hulme's story "quietly, beautifully and sensitively."
LAST WEEK TONIGHT WITH JOHN OLIVER 11 p.m. on HBO. In a cultural moment filled with "hot takes" and breakneck news cycles, John Oliver's late-night show has stood out in part by consistently delivering longer, in-depth stories -- like reports on the enduring use of Confederate symbols in America and the United States' relationship with Saudi Arabia -- while also leaving time for comparisons between the Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov and a Keebler elf and creating a fake trailer for a "Fast and Furious" parody in which Armie Hammer leads a group of presidential wax statues in a heist to steal a jock strap.
What's Streaming
KEN JEONG: YOU COMPLETE ME, HO Stream on Netflix. Ken Jeong, the "Hangover" and "Crazy Rich Asians" actor, returns to where he started out -- the Ice House Comedy Club in Pasadena, Calif. -- for this comedy special. He discusses his unusual background (he used to be a doctor), meeting Tom Hanks and being recognized by the defendant at a murder trial after being called in for jury duty.
THE PARTY (2018) Stream on Hulu. Sally Potter's gloomy black-and-white comedy stars Kristin Scott Thomas and Timothy Spall as a married couple throwing what is meant to be a celebratory party. It's a bad one, spoiled by narcissistic friends and betrayal, but its guests are very recognizable: Patricia Clarkson, Cherry Jones, Cillian Murphy and others make appearances. The movie features "some very fine actors and a lot of empty chatter," Manohla Dargis wrote in her review for The Times.

ICE Detains Millionaire Fugitives Facing Prison in Ecuador

Texto completo: Two millionaire fugitives from Ecuador, whose family poured hundreds of thousands of dollars into American political campaigns as they fought to stay in the United States, were arrested last week in Miami by immigration authorities, officials said.
Roberto and William Isaías, 74 and 75, were taken on Wednesday to a detention facility where undocumented immigrants are held pending deportation, according to the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency.
It was not immediately clear what prompted the authorities to make the arrests, but ICE's statement said the brothers were "unlawfully present" in the United States.
The Isaías brothers, bankers vilified in Ecuador for increasing their wealth in the late 1990s just as their bank collapsed -- wiping out tens of thousands of customers' savings -- were convicted of embezzlement by a court there in 2012. They were sentenced to prison terms in absentia, having arrived in South Florida almost a decade earlier.
The brothers have vehemently denied accusations that they looted their bank, and said that the Ecuadorean government had politicized the case and unfairly seized their assets. They are still battling in the courts to recover their properties at home.
Ecuador has estimated that the brothers cost the country $400 million, and has for years sought their extradition. At one point, even the American ambassador in Ecuador lobbied for their prompt return, accusing the men of financing a $2 million bribe to get Ecuador's attorney general to drop the case.
As their criminal case heated up in Ecuador, the cash started flowing in the United States. The Isaías brothers' relatives donated tens of thousands dollars to members of the United States Congress, and $90,000 to help re-elect President Barack Obama.
A year after the donation to the Obama campaign, the Department of Justice rejected Ecuador's extradition request, saying it lacked sufficient proof.
The Ecuadorean government later accused Washington of denying its request in exchange for checks. The Obama administration said the donations had nothing to do with its decisions.
A renewed request for extradition is pending, said Alvin B. Davis, the Ecuadorean government's lawyer in Miami. The Department of Justice referred questions to ICE.
The Isaías brothers are now expected to appear for a deportation hearing in immigration court, said Nestor J. Yglesias, a spokesman for ICE.
Mr. Davis said the government of Ecuador, having won a civil case in Florida against the brothers, is preparing to fight for some $1.3 billion in damages. The arrest left him "gratified," he said.
"They need to be held responsible after all these years," Mr. Davis said.
The Isaías's lawyer in Ecuador, Jorge Zavala Egas, referred questions about the arrest to a South Florida publicist, Alfredo J. Balsera.
Contacted by phone, Mr. Balsera said The New York Times had acted in "bad faith" in previous articles about the Isaías case and declined to comment.
In a 2014 interview, Roberto Isaías denied asking for favors in exchange for political donations.
"My family has given to about 20 congressmen who fight for human rights and freedom of speech in Latin America," he said. "That's legal."

The electability trap

Texto completo: It's only February 2019, and we already have five mainstream female candidates for president: Democratic Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand (N.Y.), Kamala Harris (Calif.), Amy Klobuchar (Minn.), Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (Hawaii). Right off the bat, Warren - the first to announce an "exploratory committee" in the race for the Democratic nomination - inspired some textbook examples of how not to think about female politicians. Take Politico's article "Warren battles the ghosts of Hillary," published at the end of December, which included the poisonous question: "How does Warren avoid a Clinton redux - written off as too unlikable before her campaign gets off the ground?" It received a drubbing on Twitter and in the press held that the two politicians had little in common, aside from their gender; plus, its argument about likability was purely speculative, with no examples of unpleasantness or on-the-record sources proffered.
As more female candidates join the contest, however, the anxieties about the demographics of the race are taking a clearer shape. It's not about a candidate's personality anymore. The "problem" involves the electability of women as a class. Yet discussions of whether women face a penalty in elections often rely on a phenomenon you might call "sexism by proxy." It's not me - the journalist or party power broker or ordinary citizen - who thinks ambitious women are bossy or unlikable, the argument goes. It's other voters who (may) hold such views. And in a close election, any disadvantage can make you a loser. So why "take another chance," as one former Democratic National Committee member told the New York Times, in an article with the headline " 'There's a Real Tension.' Democrats Puzzle Over Whether a Woman Will Beat Trump." (Former vice president Joe Biden's claim that only he is electable against President Trump implies a similar notion.)
Behind all this is the belief that a woman - even an exceptional one - is less likely than a man to win an election against a man. But even if women face a slight penalty at the ballot box (a claim social scientists still argue about), that doesn't answer the question of what voters should do with that information. If it is unethical to vote against a person purely because of her sex, is it any better to vote that way because other people are sexist? The problem quickly becomes self-fulfilling, especially when commentators amplify the concern. If reporters and analysts make Americans think women are seriously hampered, more voters will write off female candidates. The United States will never get a female president if these are the rules.
People understandably think sexism contributed to Hillary Clinton's defeat in 2016. Although 92 percent of Americans told told Gallup in 2015 they'd vote for a woman, that still leaves 8 percent who would not. As a candidate, Trump's sexism was overt, with attacks on Clinton as a "nasty woman," harsh criticism of female journalists (notably Megyn Kelly), derisive comments about Republican candidate Carly Fiorina and, of course, the "Access Hollywood" video . After the election, an analysis of survey data by Tufts political scientist Brian Schaffner and his team found that sexism motivated some Trump voters.
But it's not at all clear that sexism made a difference to the election's outcome. Clinton famously got clobbered by white voters without college degrees, trailing Trump by almost 40 percentage points in that group. A debate immediately sprung up over whether economic worries or racism and sexism drove those votes.
Schaffner's study found that sexism and racism played far greater roles than economic pressures did - which would seem to lend weight to the sexism-did-Clinton-in thesis. The researchers examined the answers to various questions put to 3,500 voters before the election and 2,830 of those same voters afterward. To gauge levels of "hostile sexism," the authors asked voters whether women "are too easily offended," whether women "seek to gain power by getting control over men" and whether women cite discrimination when they lose a fair contest. Similar questions probed racist sentiment, and these voters were also asked how their incomes had changed in recent years.
The most sexist white, non-college voters were 30 percentage points more likely to vote for Trump than the least sexist. (Racism was similarly influential in determining votes.) In contrast, the correlation between economic woes and votes for Trump was much less robust.
But as far as the viability of a female candidate is concerned, the crucial question is whether those voters were ever in play for the Democrats, and Schaffner thinks they probably weren't. Most voters with hostile sexist views were in the Republican camp, he and his team conclude; they had been moving Republican for many election cycles.
"To have clear evidence that Clinton's gender cost her the election, we would expect to find that the sexist Obama voters from 2012 switched to Trump in 2016," he tells me. "That is not what we found in our study."
In short, polarization may suppress the effects of sexism on voting, he and other scholars think. It's even possible that Clinton gained from beliefs about in women in politics. Examining some of the same survey data as Schaffner, two University of Texas at Dallas politics professors, Harold Clarke and Marianne Stewart, rated voters on a scale of "progressive" to "traditionalist" on gender issues, analyzing responses to such statements as "women often earn lower salaries than men for doing the same jobs" and "the proper role for women is to be good wives and good mothers." On a scale of 0 to 100, with 0 meaning most progressive, the median voter scored 40. Traditionalists obviously voted against Clinton, but the general progressive tilt in the electorate on gender issues surprised the authors. Among voters, her identity as a woman "likely helped Clinton more than it hurt her," they concluded in June 2017.
And a 2018 Pew Research Center study found that while 57 percent of Americans thought women brought different strengths than men to leadership roles (43 percent the sexes as roughly similar), overall those respondents saw a slight advantage in the female style. Women are seen as better at working out compromises, for example.
Such findings certainly cut against the conventional wisdom, and are in tension with other studies identifying bias. In o ne 2008 study , four public-opinion scholars found that 26 percent of voters included "a woman serving as president" on a list of things that made them "angry or upset," alongside rising gas prices and other irritants. To encourage frankness, the study was designed so the respondents thought the researchers wouldn't know how they had answered the questions. Granted, that was 11 years and one popular-vote victory by a female presidential candidate ago. But in the run-up to the 2016 election, Fairleigh Dickinson University political scientist Dan Cassino showed that, if you "primed" men to think about gender - specifically, the fact that women increasingly out-earn their husbands - they were more likely to vote for Trump than for Clinton. Male voters who were not prompted to think about that topic preferred Clinton. That study might be cause for worry among Democrats considering, say, a Warren vs. Trump election.
Much of the work on voters' attitudes toward female candidates understandably focuses on the congressional level and below. (There are 102 women in the House of Representatives - 23 percent of the total - and 25 senators.) And that research tends to suggest that voters are quite open to female candidates. "When women run for office, they raise as much money and are just as likely to win their races as men," point out Danny Hayes and Alexandra D. Kurtz of George Washington University, and Jennifer L. Lawless of the University of Virginia, in a recent working paper. They also receive similar press coverage, Hayes and Lawless found in their 2016 book, "Women on the Run." The pair closely analyzed the content of coverage in the biggest newspaper in each congressional district in the midterm elections of 2010 and 2014 and uncovered no evidence that reporters focused on women's appearance or described their character traits more negatively.
One provocative thesis holds that bias persists, yet women perform as well as men in elections because they are simply better candidates. Sarah A. Fulton, an associate professor of political science at Texas A&M, has described this as the "Running Backwards and in High Heels" phenomenon (an allusion to Ginger Rogers, the backward-dancing partner of Fred Astaire). A 2012 study by Fulton made use of a survey of 2,672 political activists and potential candidates across a random sample of congressional districts in 1998. They were asked about various attributes of incumbents, including dedication to public service, integrity and public speaking. Female incumbents did as well in the 1998 election as men but were rated by observers, on average, far higher than the men on their political skills. If the woman had been merely equally qualified, Fulton wrote, "they would encounter significant electoral sanctions."
What should the strategically minded voter do with this complex body of evidence? No one is quite coming out and saying that women should not run for the Democratic nomination, though some political discussion and coverage has implied just that. But even if the data was convincing, rather than fragile at best, informally disqualifying women from the nomination would be wrong. Everyone would be horrified if the Democratic National Committee banned women from competing - that would be outlandish, actionable sex discrimination. But is explicitly doing something immoral and illegal really worse than doing it in a more informal way?
Gillibrand, Harris, and the rest have made the idea of an all-male primary moot. But Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters are still painfully anxious that their party might botch the campaign against Trump. When polled in January, those voters rated two possible Democratic candidates who are white men - Biden and Sanders - the most favorably, citing electability as their main concern.
Electability is a reasonable focus, but such calculations should be informed by data, not instinct. Rather than making female candidates bear the burden of our worries, we should direct our energies elsewhere. First, we should be vigilant that the playing field is indeed level. Despite studies showing that the media is getting better at covering female candidates, voters should remain alert to unfairness. One study of the 2008 Democratic primary race found that major-network reporters referred to Clinton by her first name four times as frequently as they did Barack Obama. In 2016, after a primary debate, commentators on the cable show "Morning Joe" described Clinton as "screaming" and "feisty," while a New York Times news article said she "appeared tense and even angry at times." As we've seen, when voters are given sexist prompts, they may be spurred to make sexist decisions.
News coverage of Klobuchar in the week of her announcement immediately homed in on on the accusation that she was too hard on her staff, raising the question of whether a male politician would be criticized on similar grounds.
Ultimately, it's up to individual voters to choose the best candidate, regardless of gender - and not let myths about electability shackle us. The shock over Trump's victory, in the face of his sexist rhetoric and behavior, makes it understandable that some people think a woman can't win in 2020. But the best social science research suggests that such a claim is not defensible.
That so many voters persist in underrating the chances of superb, accomplished female candidates, on the basis of sex alone, highlights our lingering disrespect for women. "A woman can't beat Trump," it turns out, is the lowest form of political analysis - the prediction you turn into reality by repeating it often enough.

Women on Money &amp; Mindset: Who’s in your personal brain trust?

Texto completo: The term “brain trust” is a term that was used by James Kieran, a New York Times reporter, to describe the group of leaders assembled by Franklin Delano Roosevelt during his presidential administration. President Roosevelt brought these “brains” together to advise him, decode problems and design new solutions for America.
When you think about it, having your own personal brain trust is a wise thing, no matter what our title or position. Life is complex, and those with whom we surround ourselves can make a difference in the way we look at life, contribute and enjoy the ride.
Who’s in your brain trust? And can the people in it support and challenge you in the following five ways?
Perspective
Living in the 21st century requires complex decision-making, being able to see and understand a problem or challenge from all angles.
Albert Einstein told us that we can’t solve problems with the same mindset that created them. However, it’s often difficult to step outside oneself to see other angles. Having a brain trust made up of people who come from various industries and backgrounds means you can tap into a vast pool of experience for greater perspective and creative solutions.
President Roosevelt’s brain trust helped him enact 19 laws to meet America’s challenges in just his first 100 days in office. He freely admitted this was due to having an intellectual powerhouse to bring ideas and perspective that he could not bring to the table alone.
Powerful support
It can get lonely as you carry out big responsibilities. Carrying this alone can cause isolation and stress. Unburdening and processing with family members or coworkers often creates greater stress on these relationships and can’t always provide the kind of support you need to meet life and work demands effectively.
It’s important for you to create a safe and powerful support system that is trustworthy, confidential and helpful in processing the complexity of your challenges.
Challenge
If you want to continue to grow so you lead both your life and work solidly into the future, you need input. What are you not seeing that you need to examine? How is not leading at a higher level affecting your life and work?
With great responsibilities, you can operate from “stress mode” as you address the immediate and urgent. This can develop tunnel vision and you will lean on familiar approaches that cannot meet more complex problems. This dynamic will prevent you from solving these problems, and meeting the important goals that will truly make a difference for you and the others around you.
A brain trust will challenge you where you might be playing small with limited thinking or approaches. It will provide that safe space for you to confront where you are holding yourself back and decide how you want to move forward.
Accountability
Change is hard. Growth is hard. Without an accountability mechanism, the biggest goals and commitments are seldom met successfully. As you process and make the necessary decisions to move forward, a brain trust will keep you accountable to yourself and your personal and professional commitments.
And because a brain trust’s only agenda is your agenda, you can count on your brain trust as an unbiased and supportive group that has your best interests in mind. This will help you to stay on track and to focus where you need in order to meet goals.
Community
How edifying and uplifting is your community? If you are like most, you have little time to enjoy the nurturing benefits of connection and community. In fact, your responsibilities and pace can limit your ability to form a meaningful community and to enjoy the gifts and benefits of bonds and belonging.
Your community can feel fragmented and might be made up solely of some of these:
* frantic seasonal socializing to reconnect with old friends during holidays
* etworking and brainstorming with peers
* industry- or business-specific meetings with colleagues
* connections with families of your kids and grandkids during sports season
* a weekly (if even that!) church experience
An intentionally focused community that encourages intellectual improvement, supports personal and professional growth, and genuinely cares about you is invaluable and rejuvenating. What’s more, being able to connect with this kind of community in a time of crisis or celebration is priceless.
How effective is your own brain trust? Here’s to taking charge to make yours exceptional, so that you can enjoy a more meaningful and rewarding journey in your life and work.

What is the soul, if there is one?

Texto completo: In his new translation of the Hebrew Bible, completed after two decades of work, Robert Alter presents a refreshingly novel understanding of "soul," as this article explains ("A New Hebrew Bible," New York Times, December 20, 2018):
"The problem with this "soul," for Alter, is its Christian connotations of an incorporeal and immortal being, the dualism of the soul apart from the body. Nefesh, to the contrary, suggests the material, mortal parts, the things that make us alive on this earth. The body ... that Hebrew word, nefesh, can mean many things. It can be 'breath' or 'life-breath.' It can mean 'throat' or 'neck' or 'gullet.' Sometimes it can suggest 'blood.' It can mean 'person' or even a 'dead person,' 'corpse.' Or it can be 'appetite' or something more general: 'life' or even 'the essential self.' But it's not quite 'soul.'"
I immediately connected this with Walt Whitman's proclamation: "The soul is not more than the body and the body is not more than the soul" (Song of Myself, 48).
As with many words used by religious folks, "soul" can mean just about anything anybody thinks it means. In my way of thinking, dividing the human person into mind/body/soul/spirit can be interesting but ultimately we need to put ourselves back together. I suspect, like Humpty Dumpty, we'll have a pretty hard time doing that, given centuries of cracking the in-dividual (the undivided person) into neat divisions.
Yet, couldn't our deepest emotions and highest feelings of exhilaration be called "soul"?
The NYT reporter asked Alter, "(Doesn't) 'soul' help dramatize (some of the Bible's) intense emotion? I mentioned another instance of the word nefesh, the terrifyingly evocative line from the King James' translation of Psalm 69: "For the waters are come in unto my soul."
"Oh, yes," Alter said, with a smile. "That one does have a certain emotional resonance to it. But it's not what the poet had in mind. And, I would add that the line 'for the waters have come up to my neck' ... is also rather dramatic."
We have a flair for the dramatic, preferring the strange and mysterious to the normal and commonplace. As I often say, Nature and our earthly life just doesn't seem to be enough for many people. I enjoy a good mystery as much as anyone. My wife and I like to watch "Inspector Lewis," "Elementary," "Father Brown" and other mystery shows. Investigating clues and searching for the truth is fascinating. We're not as interested in the "paranormal" stuff.
Whitman took his sense of soul a huge step further: "And no one, not God, is greater to one than one's self is."
Which brings us to our "selves." I'm not a psychologist (one who studies the psyche — the human person) but I'm not sure it really helps us to chop ourselves into selves, souls, persons. The dictionary can't help too much when it comes to the "self": "a person's essential being that distinguishes them from others."
Are we left with "I am" and "You are"? Maybe so.
In Hindu belief, each "self" is a part of the great, eternal "Self." We are small gods in the Big God. I don't see this as much different than the notion in Jesus' prayer (John 17) when he asks his divine Parent that his disciples "may be one as we are one." This suggests something more than a Trinity — perhaps a Quadrangle that includes humans?
The "Queen of Soul," Aretha Franklin, sang her powerful anthem for "Respect" as a woman, a black woman, a person. She, along with many others, might say there's something spiritual about that, but it's a demand for personal respect before anything else.
Yet, that's quite different from the "soul" faith traditions talk about. That soul can be "lost" and "saved," "healed" or "enlightened." The religious "soul" can always change and move. "Her soul went to heaven" or "He sold his soul" or "They are good faithful souls."
Definitions of "soul" range from "the spiritual or immaterial part of a human being or animal, regarded as immortal" to common usages like "in the depths of my soul" or "I'll never tell a soul."
The word "spirit" further complicates the jigsaw puzzle of personhood.
But don't ask anyone to explain how soul and spirit are distinct. That's because no one knows, and if they say they know, we can be sure they don't. Hebrew words for soul and spirit are different as they are in Greek, and English. All of these, in my view, are guesses because we so desperately want to understand ourselves — to take us apart and put us neatly back together. A nice idea.
I guess I'm not much of a soul man.

DEMOCRATS, DEBT AND DOUBLE STANDARDS DON'T LET THE DEFICIT SCOLDS SCARE YOU INTO THINKING SMALL

Texto completo: Much of Donald Trump's State of the Union address was devoted to describing the menaces he claims face America - mainly the menace of scary brown people, but also the menace of socialism. And there has been a lot of discussion in the news media of what he said on those topics.
There has, however, been little coverage of one of the most revealing aspects of the SOTU: what Mr. Trump said about the menace of America's historically large government debt.
But wait, you may object - he didn't say anything about debt. Indeed he didn't - not one word. But that's what was so revealing.
After all, Republicans spent the entire Obama administration inveighing constantly about the dangers of debt, warning that America faced a looming crisis unless deficits were drastically reduced. Now that they're in power, however - and with the deficit surging thanks to a huge tax cut for corporations and the rich - they've totally dropped the subject.
According to ABC News, Mick Mulvaney, Mr. Trump's acting chief of staff, explained to GOP members of Congress why debt wouldn't get a single mention in the SOTU: "Nobody cares."
And you know, he's kind of right. It's not just Republicans who suddenly seemed to stop caring about debt. For years deficit scolds dominated discourse inside the Beltway; much of the news media treated the urgency of fiscal austerity as an unquestioned fact, abandoning the usual rules of reportorial neutrality and plunging into outright advocacy. Yet since Mr. Trump's election those voices have become oddly muted.
What we've just seen confirmed, then, is what some of us were trying to tell you from the beginning: All that wailing about debt was hypocritical.
Republicans never actually cared about debt; they just pretended to be deficit hawks as a way to hamstring President Barack Obama's agenda. And many centrists have turned out to have a double standard, reserving passionate concern about debt for times when Democrats hold power.
But while the about-face on debt has, as I said, been deeply revealing, there are still two big questions. First, how much should we care about debt? Second, will a double standard continue to prevail? That is, will the deficit scolds suddenly get vocal again if and when Democrats regain power?
On the first question: One surprising thing about the debt obsession that peaked around 2011 is that it never had much basis in economic analysis. On the contrary, everything we know about fiscal policy says that it's a mistake to focus on deficit reduction when unemployment is high and interest rates are low, as they were when the fiscal scolds were at their loudest.
The case for worrying about debt is stronger now, given low unemployment. But interest rates are still very low by historical standards - less than 1 percent after adjusting for inflation. This is so low that we needn't fear that debt will snowball, with interest payments blowing up the deficit. It also suggests that we're suffering from chronic weakness in private investment demand (which, by the way, the 2017 tax cut doesn't seem to have boosted at all).
So in the past few months a number of prominent economists - including the former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund and top economists from the Obama administration - have published analyses saying that even now, with unemployment quite low, debt is much less of a problem than previously thought.
It's still a bad idea to run up debt for no good reason - say, to provide tax breaks that corporations just use to buy back their own stock, which is, of course, what the GOP did. But borrowing at ultralow interest rates to pay for investments in the future - infrastructure, of course, but also things like nutrition and health care for the young, who are the workers of tomorrow - is very defensible.
Which brings us to the question of double standards.
You don't have to agree with everything in proposals for a "Green New Deal" to acknowledge that it's very much an investment program, not a mere giveaway. So it has been very dismaying to see how much commentary on these proposals either demands an immediate, detailed explanation of how Democrats would pay for their ideas, or dismisses the whole thing as impractical. Was there the same pushback against Republican tax cuts? No.
Look, we've seen this over and over again - three times since 1980. Republicans rail against budget deficits when they're out of power, then drop all their concerns and send the deficit soaring once they are in a position to cut taxes. Then when it's the Democrats' turn, they're expected to clean up the Republicans' red ink rather than address their own priorities. Enough already.
I'm not saying that Democrats should completely ignore the fiscal implications of their actions. Really big spending plans, especially if they don't clearly involve investment - for example, a major expansion of federal health spending - will have to be paid for with new taxes. But if and when Democrats are in a position to make policy, they should be ambitious, and not let the deficit scolds scare them into thinking small.

Texto completo: Ralph Lawler, the broadcaster whose catchphrases "Oh me, oh my" and "Bingo" have become synonymous with Clippers games for the last 40 seasons, will join the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame as a winner of its Curt Gowdy Media Award, the NBA announced Friday.
Lawler will be joined at the Hall ceremony Sept. 5-7 in Springfield, Mass., by fellow Gowdy Award honoree Marc Stein, a New York Times reporter and graduate of Cal State Fullerton. The award is presented to members of electronic and print media whose work has contributed to basketball.
"This is the absolute ultimate capping a 40-year career with the ball club," Lawler said. "There's no better way to do it than to have this honor. It's the ultimate honor that a broadcaster or a journalist of any sort can have. We are thrilled to death.

"We were in Boston with the Clippers playing the Celtics. [Suns broadcaster] Al McCoy who got this award deservedly some years ago told me he got a call but he didn't recognize the number so he ignored it two or three times and finally got it and said oh my goodness. I got the call then and I saw it was a Springfield number and I told ... my wife, 'Oh I better answer this.' "
Lawler, 80, is retiring after this season and several teams have honored Lawler during road games. The Clippers have used social media to publish interviews in which Lawler shares memories from his career, which has included more than 3,140 Clippers broadcasts.
"Clipper Nation calls him the 'Voice of the Clippers,' " owner Steve Ballmer said in a news release, "but Ralph is so much more than that; he is our heart and soul."
Before calling Clippers games, beginning when the franchise was in San Diego, Lawler broadcast games of Philadelphia's Phillies, 76ers and Flyers, and San Diego's Conquistadors and Chargers. He already is a member of the Bradley University Sports Hall of Fame as well as the Southern California Broadcasters Hall of Fame. He also has a star on Hollywood's Walk of Fame.
"Ralph has always had such a great spirit," Mike Breen, ABC-ESPN's national play-by-plan broadcaster, said in December. "He's not one of those 'old-time' guys who thinks the game was better when he started. His enthusiasm reflects on his impression of today's athletes. That's what I love about him.
"Over a long period of time, sometimes the hardest thing is to keep that passion year after year. I turn on a Clippers game on League Pass, and it's the same energy and feeling that there's no other place he'd rather be."
Stein was almost speechless.
"My first year covering the league was the Clippers halfway through the '93-'94 season and, I just I don't know, I don't know," Stein said. "I'm lost."

There's Always a Due Date With Those Poetry Books

Texto completo: For those of us who have long wondered what is going on in the unusual brain of the British thriller writer Sophie Hannah, her entertaining recent work of nonfiction, "How to Hold a Grudge," is a perfect document. It explains, among other things, her relish for parsing human motivation down to the subatomic level and her characters' tendency to respond to normal events with abnormal behavior that holds some internal logic for them (and for her, since she made it up) but seems wackadoodle to the rest of us.
Now all is clear. It makes sense that a woman who would devote several pages to the litany of emotions she felt about a seemingly innocuous incident involving a friend and his dog would also be the author of "The Next to Die," the latest in a series featuring the chronically dysfunctional, always amusing Culver Valley police officers.
This time around, they are forced to participate in a regional task force with officers from other jurisdictions. They're looking for a serial killer who has murdered two pairs of best friends after sending them homemade white books containing snippets of foreboding poetry. (Pay attention to the use of books and stories in this plot.)
[ Read Sophie Hannah's By the Book. ]
It's a weird case, but these are weird cops. They begin their discussions by debating whether the name they have awarded the killer for publicity purposes -- Billy Dead Mates, a play on "Billy No Mates," Brit-speak for a person with no friends -- even makes sense. "He's killing pairs of best friends, yes, but they're friends with each other, not with him," one of the officers says. "To call him Billy Dead Mates implies he's killing his own friends. And we've no reason to think he is."
The squabbling continues even as the officers band together in resentment against the ineffectual psychological profiler who has been foisted upon them and spar with Detective Inspector Giles Proust, the senior officer working the case. Proust's nickname, the Snowman, refers to "the icy wasteland he had in place of a heart," Hannah writes, and he exists for the purpose of raining invective upon his subordinates.
Who will be the next victim? Maybe Kim Tribbeck, a prickly stand-up comedian whose first-person narration forms parts of the novel. She has received one of the murderous books -- hers says "Every bed is narrow," a quote from Edna St. Vincent Millay -- which makes her an obvious candidate. But, as Kim points out, she is not yet dead and has no friends at all, let alone a best friend whose murder could be paired with hers to conform to the killer's established pattern.
Meanwhile, a magazine writer named Sondra Halliday, one of those people who always take a good argument too far, has been ranting online about how the killings are yet another example of the patriarchy's complicity in violence against women. "Billy Dead Women," she calls the killer, which is illogical, because one of the victims is a man. Her obsession with the case naturally makes her a suspect.
In "How to Hold a Grudge," Hannah peppers discussions of the grudges of others with deconstructions of her own -- grudges being negative experiences from the past "that you choose to remember in the present for valid, positive reasons," she says -- and of her forgive-but-do-not-forget philosophy. She is inclined to give her characters room to express their own irritations.
There is annoyance aplenty in "The Next to Die," and it is strange but funny. Sgt. Charlie Zailer, for starters, is annoyed that her sister and her sister's boyfriend may have "pretended to split up rather than actually split up," so she does a little off-piste undercover work, spying on her sister on trains and in cafes.
Kim is annoyed at her ex-husband for smoking too much weed, and at her ex-boyfriend for being so clueless and uncommunicative. "How do most people resist the urge to flatten you with a meat hammer?" she muses, of the boyfriend. Proust is annoyed at the way Sondra spells her name. Sondra is annoyed at men in general.
Hannah is also a poet and the author of two extremely good Hercule Poirot mysteries, written with the approval of Agatha Christie's estate, that pay homage to their source but bear Hannah's trademark bite and off-the-wallness.
Longtime admirers of this author were excited to see her appear in a thrilling cameo role in a recent New Yorker article about the publisher and novelist Dan Mallory. Mallory, who was once Hannah's editor and sort-of friend, is revealed in the piece to be a serial fabulist who fooled large swatches of the publishing industry by falsely claiming to have a fatal brain tumor, among other things. As Ian Parker points out in the piece, Hannah's second Poirot book, "Closed Casket," features a preposterous but charming Mallory-esque character whose own multitude of falsehoods includes the pretense that he is dying of kidney disease.
Hannah's plots are like intricate jigsaw puzzles whose pieces you cannot believe will fit together, until you see the completed picture. Her denouements tend to make more sense in retrospect than at the time. The fun in reading "The Next to Die" -- even when the scaffolding fails to fully support the structure -- isn't in learning whodunit, but in following the labyrinthine byways of its author's peculiar worldview and the twisted motives of her characters.
"I should hope that nobody would read one of my books only to find out the answer," says one of her characters -- a novelist herself -- in "Closed Casket." "It's the working out, and the psychology, that matters."

Claytopia is coming, and some shows are already up

Texto completo: If you’re wondering why pottery shows are popping up all over, and not just at Northern Clay Center, the answer lies in an acronym: NCECA. It stands for the National Council on Education for the Ceramic Arts, its membership includes studio potters, artists, educators, collectors, fans, galleries and organizations (like Northern Clay), and its 53rd annual conference, Claytopia, will be held at the Minneapolis Convention Center on March 27-30.
More than 6,500 people attended the 2018 conference in Pittsburgh. This will be only the second time NCECA has come to Minnesota, the first being 1995, when it was at the U of M.
Several pottery/clay/ceramics/related shows are already up and will stay in place through Claytopia, so you can check them out starting now. A few examples: “Strange Place” at Macalester’s Law Warschaw Gallery, which brings together contemporary artists from across the United States, Europe and Asia who work in video, performance, sculpture, audio, photography and mixed media. “The Form Will Find Its Way: Contemporary Ceramic Sculpture Abstraction” at the U of M’s Nash Gallery, an international exhibition with work by more than 35 artists. “Ruth Crane: A Ceramic Collector’s Journey” at the U’s Goldstein Gallery, a show of objects ranging from Arts and Crafts pottery to new works by ceramicists from across the country. “Accumulation: New Work by Monica Rudquist & Judy Onofrio” at the Catherine G. Murphy Gallery at St. Catherine University, a show of breathtaking sculptural work, some of which started as bones and some of which started on the potter’s wheel. All of the exhibitions are free, and there will be more – many more.
“Finding the Authentic Self,” which opens this Sunday (Feb. 17) at the Sabes JCC, was inspired by a song by Minnesota musician Dan Israel. Curated by Steve Basile, a longtime ceramics collector, founder of the Curated Ceramics website and the large, very active and occasionally scrappy Studio Pottery Collectors Facebook group, the show will feature work by 16 potters and one painter. Pieces will be accompanied by short essays, written by the artists, that address the exhibition theme. The narrative is in keeping with the Curated Ceramics website, where pots are offered for sale, but that’s not all. You get to know the artists through text (introductions, artist statements), photographs of their process and studio, portfolios, and videos.
The works this show is about – and Curated Ceramics, and Northern Clay, and the annual St. Croix Valley Pottery Tour (which draws thousands of people), and the amazing collection at the Weisman Art Museum, and NCECA – aren’t made by the thousands in factories. They are made one at a time by actual human beings. Each has a story to tell. The edge of the cup you bring to your lips was shaped by someone’s fingers.
An opening reception for “Finding the Authentic Self” will take place Sunday from 2-5 p.m. Several of the artists will be in attendance. Israel will play some music starting at 3 p.m., after which some of the artists will speak. FMI. Free.
Dave Eggers at the Parkway rescheduled
Events were canceled left and right during the Polar Vortex, but some people were still planning to brave the x-treme weather to see Dave Eggers and Mokhtar Alkhanshali at the Parkway on Jan. 30, a night of record-breaking cold. Then their flight was canceled. Prayers have been answered and everyone will try again on Wednesday, March 6.
Eggers’ latest nonfiction page-turner is the tale of Alkhanshali, a young Yemeni-American entrepreneur who decides to make coffee from Yemen great again, then gets caught up in a civil war. It’s also the story of coffee itself, and why the good stuff costs so much, and should. The award-winning author of many books and founder of McSweeney’s, Eggers is a remarkable writer, and Alkhanshali is a remarkable man whose life gets wilder and wilder. Will there be coffee? Presented by Magers & Quinn. Doors at 6 p.m., conversation at 7, book signing to follow. FMI and tickets ($10 general admission, $26 with book).
The picks
Looking for theater that won’t let you off easy? This is your weekend.
Opens tonight (Friday, Feb. 15) at the Center for Performing Arts: Art and Identity: Wing Young Huie and Jarrelle Barton. McKnight Distinguished Artist and Minnesota Book Award finalist Wing Young Huie will show images from his recent book and exhibit “Chineseness: The Meanings of Identity and the Nature of Belonging.” Barton, a young African-American man who fell in love with an ancient Chinese instrument and taught himself Chinese so he could master it, will play the guzheng, a 21-string Chinese zither. And theater artist H. Adam Harris will guide the artists and the audience in a conversation. 7 p.m. FMI and reservation. Pay-what-you-can at the door.
Opens Friday at the Off-Leash Art Box: Uprising Theatre Company: “Line of Sight.” Uprising is devoting its 2019 season of four plays to a single theme: gun violence. Written by founder and artistic director Shannon TL Kearns, “Line of Sight” tells the story of an angry, alienated young man and a tragic event. 7:30 p.m. FMI and tickets ($20; pay-what-you-can starts at $5). Closes March 2.
Now at Penumbra Theatre: “benevolence.” The second play in Ifa Bayeza’s trilogy about Emmett Till is having its world premiere on Penumbra’s stage. If you saw Bayeza’s “The Ballad of Emmett Till” in 2014, and even if you didn’t, there are many reasons to go: 1) because Penumbra, 2) because Talvin Wilks is director (and was for “Ballad,” too), 3) because the horrific death of a young black boy in 1955 changed history, 4) because we are still, as a nation, profoundly messed up when it comes to race, and we should seek out learning and enlightenment, which brings us back to 5) because Penumbra. FMI and tickets ($15-40). Closes March 10.
Opens Saturday at the Highland Park Community Center: Minnesota Jewish Theatre Company: “Actually.” Sexual consent is the timely topic of Anna Ziegler’s play, in which two Princeton students – a white Jewish woman and an African American man – must share the details of an intimate evening together before a university panel. Miriam Schwartz and JuCoby Johnson star, and right there is an excellent reason to see this. A regional premiere, directed by Harry Waters Jr. 8 p.m. FMI and tickets ($28-38). Closes March 10.
Sunday at Orchestra Hall: The Julian Bliss Septet: Gershwin and Tin Pan Alley. Last here in 2016, the former child prodigy British clarinetist will continue his love affair with Gershwin’s music in an afternoon of popular melodies and swinging tunes. The program will include original arrangements of a suite from “Porgy and Bess,” an excerpt from “Rhapsody in Blue” and songs including “I Got Rhythm” and “Lady Be Good.” You can’t go wrong. Bliss will perform with his hand-picked septet; the Minnesota Orchestra does not appear on this program. 2 p.m. FMI and tickets ($32-80).
Tuesday at the University Club of St. Paul: Readings by Writers. Poet Tim Nolan will host an impressive group of writers including Milkweed authors Michael Bazzett and Claire Wahmanholm, Graywolf author Gretchen Marquette and MadHat Press author Mary Moore Easter. Bazzett’s “The Popol Vuh,” a new translation of the Mayan creation myth, was a New York Times Best Poetry Book of 2018. Wahmanholm’s dystopic “Wilder” (rhymes with bewilder) won the 2018 Lindquist & Vennum Prize for Poetry (now the Ballard Spahr Prize for Poetry; submissions for the 2019 prize close today, Friday, Feb. 15). Marquette’s debut collection, “May Day,” was a finalist for the 2017 Minnesota Book Award. Mary Moore Easter’s “The Body of the World” is a finalist for this year’s award. 7:30 p.m. Free.

Texto completo: The revival of centuries-old rye whiskeys -- including Monongahela and Maryland styles -- is helping foster a renewed interest in historic spirits.
"Rye whiskey in general is swinging upward in the market," said Teresa DeFlitch, director of people and education at Pittsburgh-based Wigle Whiskey.
The volume of rye whiskey produced in the United States increased nearly 16 percent in 2018, with makers selling more than 1 million cases for the first time, the Distilled Spirits Council reported this week. U.S. distillers sold just 88,000 cases of rye in 2009, according to DSC figures.
Instead of focusing on cornering a market and competing about which is better, craft distillers in the Mid-Atlantic region instead are embracing the past and the area's role in American whiskey -- rye, in particular, said DeFlitch.
The New York Times quoted her in an article published Friday about the resurgence of Maryland-style rye whiskey, even if people aren't really sure what it was exactly.
"For all its fame and praise, no one quite knows what 'Maryland style' meant," the Times story noted. "Most distillers back before Prohibition did not keep recipes, or document how they made their whiskey."
The sweeter palette of Maryland-style rye whiskey likely came from using corn in the mash bill or swapping out distillers yeast for brewers yeast -- or both.
Western Pennsylvania's Monongahela Rye, considered by many as the gold standard of whiskey at one point, was known for it peppery bite -- largely because it was made predominantly, if not completely, from rye.
For those that haven't savored the nuance, DeFlitch compared it to the difference between rye bread and cornbread.
"Our ryes, we do in the style of Monongahela Rye," DeFlitch said. "One of the reasons we were founded was to bring back that history."
Wigle began operating in Pittsburgh's Strip District in late 2011, becoming the city's first whiskey distillery since Prohibition -- a period from 1920-33 when alcoholic beverages were banned from being made, imported and sold in the United States.
Wigle has a number of rye whiskeys in its portfolio, including Single Barrel Straight Rye, Pennsylvania Rye and Pennsylvania Deep Cut Rye. Last year, the distillery partnered with the Senator John Heinz History Center to release a special, limited edition Prohibition Rye whiskey.
The roots of rye whiskey in Western Pennsylvania date to before the Whiskey Rebellion of the 1790s.
"Bountiful supplies of rye and other grain, coupled with the distilling expertise of area pioneers, created many of the largest manufacturers of rye whiskey in the world here," the Tribune-Review previously reported.
"This really was the epicenter of American whiskey for a long time," DeFlitch said of the Mid-Atlantic, which includes both Pennsylvania and Maryland. "The innovation we see today around Mid-Atlantic rye whiskey varieties is exciting. It honors that history and demonstrates the amazing craft scene we have here."

Trump issues signing statement on medical marijuana provision of funding bill

Texto completo: Marijuana Moment is a wire service assembled by Tom Angell, a marijuana legalization activist and journalist covering marijuana reform nationwide. The views expressed by Angell or Marijuana Moment are neither endorsed by the Globe nor do they reflect the Globe's views on any subject area.
President Trump said during his 2016 election campaign that he supports the right of states to legalize marijuana and that he personally supports medical cannabis. But in signing a federal spending bill into law on Friday that contains a rider preventing the Justice Department from interfering in state medical marijuana laws, the president went out of his way to make clear that he reserves the right to ignore the cannabis provision.
“Division C, section 537, provides that the Department of Justice may not use any funds to prevent implementation of medical marijuana laws by various States and territories," he said in a signing statement. “I will treat this provision consistent with the President's constitutional responsibility to faithfully execute the laws of the United States."
While the passage is a bit hard to parse on its own, here's what you need to know:
Presidents typically use signing statements to flag provisions of laws they are enacting which they believe could impede on their executive authorities. By calling out the medical cannabis rider, Trump is making clear that his administration reserves the right to broadly enforce federal drug laws against people complying with state medical marijuana laws even though Congress just told him not to.
That being said, it does not mean that a crackdown is on the way, and this isn't the first time Trump has singled out the marijuana rider, which has been part of annual federal spending legislation since 2014.
In May 2017, when signing that fiscal year's appropriations bill into law, he included a very similar proviso in his signing statement.
“Division B, section 537 provides that the Department of Justice may not use any funds to prevent implementation of medical marijuana laws by various States and territories," he wrote at the time. “I will treat this provision consistently with my constitutional responsibility to take care that the laws be faithfully executed."
But no raids against state-legal medical marijuana patients or providers followed, not even under ardently anti-cannabis then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions.
Now, as Trump signs the new statement, he has a new attorney general, William Barr, who pledged during his confirmation hearing and in writing that he would not “go after" marijuana businesses operating under state laws, medical, or otherwise.
The president's new signing statement also calls out other sections of the large-scale annual funding bill, such as one requiring advance notice to Congress when carrying out certain military actions as well as provisions on recognizing foreign governments, receiving ambassadors, and transferring Guantanamo detainees to the United States, among several other issues.
Trump issued no such statement singling out provisions of any kind when he signed the 2018 spending bill into law.

Texto completo: President Donald Trump likes to say that he hires only the best people and that his White House operates like a well-oiled machine.
But a steady stream of insider accounts flowing out of the West Wing suggests that there's more madness than method to this administration.
The most recent entries are two books that just hit best-seller lists, one by former White House aide Cliff Sims, the other by ex-New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a onetime Trump adviser.
Sims dishes about Oval Office back-stabbing in his explicitly titled "Team of Vipers." Christie's "Let Me Finish" laments Trump's choice of "amateurs, grifters, weaklings, convicted and unconvicted felons ... hustled into jobs they were never suited for."
The authors join a pantheon of disgruntled leakers or tattling ex-staffers telling tales of incompetence at the highest executive levels. Someone handed Axios three months of Trump's daily schedule, revealing in mortifying detail how the president spends more than half of his workday in vague "executive time." .
The consistent, mounting evidence of internal dysfunction is growing increasingly difficult to ignore or to explain away. And these accounts aren't coming from Democrats or anti-Trump pundits:
A senior Trump administration official, writing an anonymous column in The New York Times, characterized the president as "impetuous, adversarial, petty and ineffective," with decisions that are "half-baked, ill-informed and occasionally reckless."
Bob Woodward, in his best-selling book "Fear," diagnosed a White House suffering a "nervous breakdown," with aides stealing papers off Trump's desk to deter bad policy. Former Chief of Staff John Kelly was quoted as saying: "We're in Crazytown."
"Fire and Fury" by Michael Wolff and "Unhinged" by Omarosa Manigault Newman, the ex-White House aide and former reality TV star, questioned the president's mental well-being.
Sprinkled throughout these tell-all tomes are unflattering assessments by top aides. Ex-Defense Secretary James Mattis, according to Woodward, said Trump comprehends like a "fifth- or sixth-grader." And former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has never denied reports that he labeled Trump a "moron."
Trump and his supporters have questioned the credibility of some writers, or dismissed their accounts as sour grapes. But you have to wonder how so many aides who were hailed as brilliant choices on their way into the administration suddenly became incompetent hacks on their way out.
With more books in the pipeline, the Trump campaign is eager to try to enforce nondisclosure agreements signed by ex-staffers. What doesn't the White House want the public to know?
Trump administration insiders keep trying to warn the world that something is terribly awry. Americans ignore them at their peril.

Hellfighters' heroism

Texto completo: A century ago, on Feb. 17, 1919, the U.S. Army's 369th Infantry Regiment, nearly 3,000 African American soldiers and known as the Harlem Hellfighters, returned from World War I and marched up Fifth Avenue in Manhattan before hundreds of thousands of cheering New Yorkers. The Harlem Hellfighters weren't supposed to be heroes, but they were among the "hyphenated" troops whose accomplishments demonstrate that the United States' asymmetric advantage, in war as well as in peace, is diversity.
The 369th Infantry Regiment was part of the Army's Rainbow Division, 27,000 troops from across the country quickly mustered after the U.S. entered World War I in April 1917. Most of the division shipped out to Europe in August of that year; the Hellfighters didn't arrive in France until late December. They had not been allowed to march off to war with the rest of their Rainbow Division because "black is not a color of the rainbow."
American military leaders expected the troops of the 369th to be terrible soldiers. Like most black recruits in World War I, they weren't intended to fight but to be manual laborers at the front. They were issued inferior uniforms and weapons, and then, in an emergency, they were transferred to the French army, whose officers were explicitly told to treat them as second-class soldiers.

Despite the discrimination and the disadvantages, the men of the 369th became one of the war's most decorated and celebrated units. They fought for 191 days, longer than any other U.S. unit. In that time, they never lost a trench to the enemy or a man to capture. They earned the respect of both allies and enemies. The Germans they defeated were responsible for their signature nickname.
At 11 a.m. on Feb. 17, three months after the armistice, the Hellfighters began their 7-mile homecoming march -- the first such parade for any American troops in New York. The New York World newspaper recorded that, despite weather that hovered in the 30s, "no more joyful, cheerful, enthusiastic reception was ever recorded anywhere" and noted that "white folks mingled with their colored brethren in the lower part of the avenue, but there the crowd was mostly white." At 60th Street, the official reviewing party included New York Gov. Alfred E. Smith, senior military officers and city luminaries including New York Journal publisher William Randolph Hearst.
Leading the Hellfighters was the regiment's commander, Col. William Hayward, a forward-thinking white officer, but according to the New York Times, it was the parade's "big man," Sgt. Henry "Black Death" Johnson, who pushed the crowd to "hysterics."
Johnson had earned his fame on May 15, 1918, when his two-man outpost in France's Argonne Forest was attacked by two dozen German raiders. With ammunition gone, and his partner, Pvt. Needham Roberts, wounded, Johnson fought off the attackers with little more than a bolo knife and prevented Roberts' capture. "Black Death" was just 5-foot-4 and weighed 130 pounds.
When Johnson was asked about his heroic exploits, the former Albany, N.Y., train porter responded: "There wasn't anything so fine about it. Just fought for my life. A rabbit would have done that."
But bravery like that cannot be ignored. The commander of the American Expeditionary Force, Gen. John J. Pershing, explicitly mentioned Johnson's heroism in a dispatch just a few days after the fight. The French army in the sector stood at attention while Johnson and Roberts were awarded the Croix de Guerre, France's highest military honor, and Johnson's medal included the Gold Palm for extraordinary valor. Former President Theodore Roosevelt would call Johnson one of the "five bravest Americans" of World War I, but it would take until 2015 for Johnson to receive the Medal of Honor, decades after his death.
Twenty-five percent of the Americans fighting in France were hyphenated Americans. Native Americans, like the Choctaw code talkers, wielded their language as an unbreakable military code during the war (and inspired the Navajo code talkers of World War II). Chinese American Sgt. Sing Lau Kee, from San Jose, held his post through gas and shrapnel attacks, earning a Distinguished Service Cross and praise from a fellow soldier who called him "the best American" in the unit. And Pvt. Marcelino Serna, a Mexican American who migrated to El Paso before the war, took out an enemy machine gun, a sniper, and an entire German platoon on his own, becoming the most decorated Texan of World War I.
The Hellfighters, Kee and Serna of 100 years ago remind us that what matters most isn't race, ethnicity or national origin -- they are century-old proof that while American society might not be color-blind, heroism is.

Texto completo: Women, especially women of color and poor women, tend to suffer disproportionately in our health care system. The problem is growing worse now that there's a group of trial lawyers eager to exploit female victims, under the guise of offering help.
Take, for instance, that roughly one-quarter of U.S. women suffer from pelvic floor disorders, and according to The Washington Post, about 3-4 million of them have been treated with transvaginal mesh. The vast majority of these women receive repairs using transvaginal mesh without complications, but a significant minority experienced serious problems.
After the publicity surrounding this issue hit the fan, the lawyers pounced. It has come to light that a collaboration involving some law firms, doctors, and finance companies are pressuring women into unnecessary surgeries to remove the mesh. Giving new meaning to the term "insult to injury," this phenomenon, according to The New York Times, is leading unsuspecting women to the operating table - even in cases when the removal could worsen the symptoms.
If that's not enough, some unscrupulous hedge funds are financing companies connected with law firms specializing in suing manufacturers of the mesh. These law firms often use overseas telemarketing callers in countries such as India and die Philippines to contact women, known to have had the mesh surgery, with offers to join in lawsuits to sue the mesh manufacturers.
The New York Times highlighted a growing problem that tends to target women: the industry grown out of medical device settlements. For example, a court-ordered, charitable fund, die Common Benefit Trust, established out of the Dow Corning breast implant settlement fund, which also resulted from a faulty medical device. The Common Benefit Trust appears to have used some of this money to fund policy centers, advocacy groups, and a conference on litigation.
Pelvic organ prolapse, a medical issue sought to be treated by the transvaginal mesh, is one of the most common reasons for women to have surgery. It is ranked among the top three reasons that women have hysterectomies.
Then there are racial disparities. Compared with African-American women, Latina and White women had four to five times higher risk of symptomatic prolapse, thought to be in large part due to the lower
rates of African-American women reporting the condition as a problem to doctors. Researchers see this pattern as part of a culture where African-American and/or poor women will not typically see the condition as a problem requiring them to consider surgery.
Issues such as the transvaginal mesh that has revealed disparate treatment of women are not new. All patients - but especially women patients and minority patients that have traditionally been marginalized - deserve better than to be exploited in some of their most vulnerable times.
Those vulnerable times include childbirth and other areas of maternal health.
Dr. Niva Lubin-Johnson, president of the National Medical Association, which represents more than 50,000 African-American physicians on issues of health disparities and justice, says, "There is a crisis for African-American women that is related to maternal mortality - and that's across any economic level and educational level for African-American women. We are losing in that area."
As for the transvaginal mesh, Lubin-Johnson says women must take extreme precaution when contacted by anyone about removals of that or any other device.
"No, you go talk to your own physician about that and not to someone who is doing a cold call because of some possibility of joining a lawsuit," she said. "Talk to your own physician first, even if they were not the one who put the mesh in."
Since The New York Times began shining a light on these bad behaviors, federal prosecutors from the Eastern District of New York have begun investigating the allegations of unnecessary and unneeded vaginal mesh removal surgeries. According to reports, doctors, lawyers, financiers and others who may have been involved in the sham have been subpoenaed.
So if you're considering medical treatment, be an informed consumer. Be sure to have your health care provider explain all of your options, as well as their possible risks and benefits. Though if these risks are not avoided, by all means, beware of financial lures to have surgeries that you do not need and could leave you in a condition far worse than before.

Versatility Opens Windows of Opportunity for Songstress Alicia Olatuja

Texto completo: Headnote Vocalist for Obamds Inauguration Honors Ancestors on New CD, Songs Composed by Women
St. Louis native Alicia Olatuja first burst on the horizon, captivating her fellow Americans and the world with her exquisite vocal artistry - unleashed after being cast as the featured soloist with the Brooklyn Tabernacle Choir in a powerful performance of a treasured American classic that has long inspired hope and patriotism during President Barack Obama's second inauguration in 2013.
While it may have been a scene unlike anything she'd ever conceived of or hoped for during a childhood filled with pinafores, ponytails, pink satin slippers and Barbie dolls - she realized that this was her moment, the reason why she had even embarked upon the road less traveled to make music her sole focus.
"I wanted to be a vet because I loved animals," she said. "It was a good, safe career. So, I majored in premed and minored in music at Mizzou [University of Missouri] . I didn't have any role models who could help me. We didn't know anyone making a living as a professional musician. I had no blueprint. But one day I heard this girl singing in one of the recital halls. She was really singing. I figured if she had courage like that, I did too. I wanted to try. I didn't want to have any regrets so I gave myself two years to see if music was really for me."
Since then, she's been about the business of becoming a singer - one dedicated to learning her craft and willing to push boundaries and herself. In her rendering of "The Battle Hymn of the Republic" in the company of President Obama, she cast an aplomb possessed by only a very special, gifted few: Marion Anderson, Leontyne Price, Sarah Vaughn, Ella Fitzgerald and Nina Simone - the list goes on.
Now with the final touches already made on a tribute to female composers revealing her mastery of multiple musical styles, from soul and jazz to classical, Latin and gospel, Olatuja anxiously awaits the release on Feb. 22nd of her sophomore album, "Intuition: Songs From the Minds of Women" - a compilation that's undeniably both appropriately titled and timed.
Produced by Kamau Ken-yatta and Ulysses Owens, Jr., selections include masterpieces penned by Brenda Russell, Sade,
Tracy Chapman, Angela Bofill, Kate Bush and Linda Creed.
Her motivation for the project: "Championing women."
"We have to be each other's cheerleaders if we want anyone else to cheer for us. That's how all movements have grown - others get on the bandwagon as they see the new wave coming. Hearing what women have to say in a new way makes sense to me - it drives me. I want to bring the artistry of women and their works to the forefront," said Olatuja who says she grew up in a home filled with women who emphasized education and encouraged a love for all kinds of music.
"My father lived in a different state, Washington; I lived in a home with a big sister, my mother who was a teacher and my grandmother - an incredible educator, nurse and counselor. We had a really special matriarchal energy all around us and it had a profound impact on my life, how I grew to understand relationships and to appreciate the importance of them," she said.
When pushed to define her genre and clarify where she fits along the musical spectrum, Alicia, described by Downbeat as one who "possesses a special instrument" and by the New York Times as a "singer with a strong and luscious tone," simply pushes back.
"When I get behind the mic, I'm not thinking about whether
I'm going to sing jazz or perform as a jazz musician. I love jazz and its many different worlds, forms and variations. And I've had great opportunities as a jazz singer that you'd expect a pop or R&B singer to have. But people like singers who can actually sing. You can't hold the human experience locked into one genre."
"I just sing what I feel and hear. I learned that when I first began to sing in church. Once I learned to give myself permission to try whatever I believed, whatever I could emotionally identify with and to give the fullest to what I'm feeling at any given moment, that's when the music began to take over."
"I'm a singer - not of any particular style or genre. I break the rules of classical chord structure. I try things, even on stage in front of an audience that don't always work. And that's okay as music, for me, exists in that one unique moment. It's not like painting where you can come back and analyze your work. Music calls for spontaneity and a willingness to improvise any time it feels right."
"But I don't mind if people really want to call me a jazz singer since my musicians, my stylings and my repertoire all happen to be associated with jazz," she said laughing.
She says she wants her new release to be the beginning of something special, even more something that's long overdue.
"We're hearing what women have to say in many new ways - that's what I want to be a part of. But finding music written solely by a woman is still difficult. More often it's done in a collaborative way. In the classical world where I studied in school, it's almost impossible to find female composers. How many female producers or engineers can you name who are making it today? We have to start somewhere."
"So, I celebrate both the older and the newer works. I encourage those from the next generation. I want people to hear what I'm doing and champion me as well. I want to sing in such a way that I can encourage people to step forward - to take their place in the world. I want to share songs that, even after I'm convinced that they're finished works, that they can continue to even inspire me."

Texto completo: David Mura got a prestigious valentine Thursday when Friends of the St. Paul Public Library announced Mura is winner of the 2019 Kay Sexton Award, presented annually to an individual or organization in recognition of long-standing dedication and outstanding work in fostering books, reading and literary activity in Minnesota.
The review panel cited Mura, a third-generation Japanese-American, for his efforts to increase literary accessibility and audiences, and foster writers of color through his workshops, mentoring and advocacy in Minnesota and nationally.
Mura, of Minneapolis, is an author, critic, teacher, mentor and performance artist whose most recent work, “A Stranger’s Journey: Race, Identity and Narrative Craft in Writing,” is a finalist for the 2019 Minnesota Book Award in general nonfiction.
He is the author of the memoirs “Turning Japanese: Memoirs of a Sansei,” also winner of the Oakland PEN Josephine Miles Book Award and a New York Times Notable Book, and “Where the Body Meets Memory.” His novel “Famous Suicides of the Japanese Empire” was a finalist for several awards. His poetry includes the National Poetry Contest winner “After We Lost Our Way”; “The Colors of Desire,” winner of a Carl Sandburg Literary Award; “Angels for the Burning”; and “The Last Incantations.”
Mura grew up in the middle-class Jewish suburb of Skokie, Ill. His parents were in an internment camp during World War II, an experience they didn’t talk about but which influenced their son’s writing.
Founder of Asian American Renaissance, which brings together artists of color in theater, literature and community arts activism, Mura’s criticisms of the play “Miss Saigon” as racist have been widely published.
Mura has also been seen at a variety of venues performing with Alexs Pate, his friend and award-winning author. Their multimedia performance piece, “Secret Colors,” is about their lives as men of color and Asian-American/African-American relations.
During his career, Mura has taught at Hamline University, Macalester College and the Minneapolis-based Loft Literary Center, where he inaugurated a special class for writers of color. He has served on the boards of the Center for Arts Criticism, SASE, the Jerome Foundation, the Loft, Pangea World Theater, and the Ananya Dance Theater.
Mura will be honored at the Minnesota Book Awards ceremony April 6 at InterContinental Hotel St. Paul Riverfront. Awards will be presented in nine book categories, as well as the annual Book Artist Award. Tickets are available at thefriends.org/ceremony, or by calling 651-222-3242.

Texto completo: "Your Love, Our Musical," a musical comedy show in which Rebecca Vigil and Evan Kaufman interview a couple from the audience and create a fully improvised musical about that couple's love story, will be offering a night of comedy and music on Friday at the Fowler Blast Furnace Room at SteelStacks in Bethlehem.
In "YLOM," Vigil and Kaufman, two of New York City's finest musical improvisers, use their comedic chemistry, vocal skill and improvisational abilities to transform audiences' simple meet-cutes into musical magic.
A critic for The New York Times called it "the most impressive musical I've seen," and added, "if you think improvising an entire show seems like a magic trick, doing it with a full band and jokes that rhyme is like making the Statue of Liberty disappear."
The doors will open at 7:30 p.m., and the show starts at 8. Tickets are $25; students/seniors, $23.50; and ArtsQuest members, $22.50.

Texto completo: Chadwick Boseman stars in a Thurgood Marshall biopic. And "Magic Mike" is on CMT.
What's on TV
MARSHALL (2017) 8 p.m. on Showtime. "The only way to get through a bigot's door," Chadwick Boseman says in this Thurgood Marshall biopic, "is to break it down." That captures the punchiness of this film, in which Boseman stars as the civil rights lawyer who became the first African-American to sit on the Supreme Court. With confidence and unexpected humor, it focuses on a 1941 case in which Marshall defended Joseph Spell, a black chauffeur and butler (played by Sterling K. Brown) accused of sexual assault by his rich, white boss (Kate Hudson). The case predates Brown v. Board of Education, in which Marshall made history, by more than a decade; the headstrong Marshall of this film is in his 30s. The movie, directed by Reginald Hudlin, revisits this era of Marshall's life with "economy, a bit of gauzy nostalgia and likable performances," Manohla Dargis wrote in her review for The New York Times. But, she said, there are moments when you wish that Hudlin "would ease up on the comedy."
MAGIC MIKE (2012) 9 p.m. on CMT. For a quiet, conventional Valentine's Day evening skip this listing. But for a Feb. 14 full of onscreen thrusts, sweat and Channing Tatum's, umm, face take advantage of this strategically timed showing of Steven Soderbergh's stripper tale. Tatum plays Mike, who dips his toe into the world of erotic dancing and then falls the rest of the way in. (The character has parallels to Tatum himself, who once worked as a stripper.) Matthew McConaughey plays a strip club entrepreneur. In her review for The Times, Manohla Dargis called the film a "funny, enjoyable romp about male strippers and the American dream."
THE WEDDING SINGER (1998) 10 p.m. on Paramount Network. In the world of '90s Adam Sandler comedies, a relationship blooming between a musician (Sandler) and a waitress (Drew Barrymore) ranks high on the sentimental scale. That makes this tale of a mulleted wedding singer losing one love and finding another a solid, nostalgic Valentine's Day pick.
What's Streaming
BECKS (2018) Rent on Amazon, Google Play, Vudu and YouTube. If the idea of Adam Sandler singing "somebody kill me" in "The Wedding Singer" is too '90s for you, consider this more earnest tale of a musician's lost and found love. The romantic drama stars Lena Hall as Becks, a Brooklyn guitar player and songwriter. After her relationship with a girlfriend (Hayley Kiyoko) goes south, Becks goes back home to Missouri to live with her ex-nun mother, Ann (Christine Lahti). While there, she teaches guitar lessons and eventually finds romance -- all while struggling with her mother's nonacceptance of her sexual orientation. In his review for The Times, Ben Kenigsberg wrote that the film "exemplifies how small judgments in pace, performance and soundtrack can transcend modest trappings."

Texto completo: The first major policy intervention from Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the noted social-media personality and future dictator-for-life of the Americas (I believe she's also a congresswoman of some sort), is a quite-extraordinary document: a blueprint for fighting climate change that manages to confirm every conservative critique of liberal environmental activism, every Republican suspicion of what global-warming alarm is really all about.
The core conservative suspicion is that when liberals talk about the dire threat of global warming, they're actually seizing opportunistically on the issue to justify, well, #fullsocialism - the seizure of the economy's commanding heights in order to implement the most left-wing possible agenda.
A conventional liberal, up until now, would dismiss that belief as simply paranoid, the product of Fox News feedback loops and the science-denying fever swamps. But the Green New Deal that Ocasio-Cortez and Massachusetts Sen. Edward Markey are sponsoring - and that four leading Democratic contenders for the presidency have already endorsed - responds by saying: Yes, that's absolutely correct.
It isn't just that the Green New Deal proposes a 10-year plan for decarbonizing the U.S. economy that would involve the kind of "war socialism" unseen since, well, World War II (a model the authors explicitly evoke). It isn't just that it dismisses all worries about deficits or inflation with a Venezuelan insouciance, or that it seems lukewarm about any policy or technology that might be tainted by capitalism or disliked by progressive interest groups.
It's also that the list of proposed policies for fighting climate change is filled with what even David Roberts of Vox, in the course of praising the Green New Deal, admits are "eyebrow-raising doozies," with everything from universal health care to a job guarantee draped under the mantle of environmentalism.
So there's a pretty easy story to tell here about why, if the Democratic Party makes the Green New Deal vision its own, that shift will empower climate-change skeptics, weaken the hand of would-be compromisers in the GOP and put the kind of climate-change package that could win at least 51 votes in the Senate even further out of reach. And also possibly help Donald Trump win re-election.
But let me temper this critique by finding two positive things to say about the Green New Deal, which between them will add up to a single cheer.
First, in moving somewhat away from the long-standing centrist emphasis on pricing carbon - via carbon taxes or a cap-and-trade system - toward a focus on direct spending, the left might be moving away from theoretical efficiency toward political feasibility.
The experience of the developed world is that carbon pricing schemes look really good in theory, but tend to either get compromised toward inefficiency in practice or else inspire populist uprisings like the gilets jaunes in France. And buried inside the sweeping command-and-control vision of the Green New Deal is the material for a more modest alternative: basically, an emphasis on research and resilience, which would spend more money on basic science, alternative-energy adaptations and mitigation in the communities most likely to be affected by storms and tides and heat.
This would point to a different zone of compromise from the one often debated up until now. Instead of centrist elites compromising to raise energy taxes that often fall heavily on the working class, you could imagine left-populists and right-populists compromising on adaptationist public works, on "big, beautiful" infrastructure projects (to borrow our president's rhetoric) that don't pretend to solve climate change but do mitigate its consequences.
If the sweeping ambition of the Green New Deal leads to positive incremental change, I think that's the most likely way it happens. But then I also want to mildly praise the resolution's anti-incrementalism - because there are virtues in trying to offer not just a technical blueprint but a comprehensive vision of the good society, and virtues as well in insisting that dramatic change is still possible in America, that grand projects and scientific breakthroughs are still within our reach.
They might not be, since the United States is presently decadent - with a stalemated politics, an aging and risk-averse population, a balkanized culture - in ways that may limit our ability to re-create the specific projects of the past and preclude a regained conception of the common good.
But the desire not to be a decadent society is a healthy one, and in that sense the Green New Deal deserves credit for looking at the American past and saying, in effect: Why not us, again?
So that's my faint praise. Enough, I hope, to earn my energy-efficient cabin an extra solar panel, bestowed by the beneficence of First Citizen AOC, in the utopia to come.

Texto completo: While the rest of the country recovers from a polar vortex, spring already has sprung in the Southwest. With the balmy weather comes dozens of events centered on everything from chili and tacos to cocktails and beer.
February is filled with food and drink events around Phoenix. But if there's one we look forward to with grumbling stomachs and watering mouths, it's Devour Culinary Classic, lauded by the New York Times as the best Southwestern culinary festival. In its 10th year, the don't-miss celebration of local and independently owned restaurants features two days of food, wine, chef demos and more.
While the Classic remains the centerpiece of Devour, it is now joined by a week-long calendar of food affairs that together make up Devour Week.
Here's your guide to all Devour Week events.
Devour Bartending Competition A week before the Classic, Devour Week kicks off with the Devour Bartending Competition. This event will be held for the first time at Portland Parkway Park in downtown Phoenix and is now co-hosted by Arizona Cocktail Weekend. At the live competition, nine bartenders will face off in head-to-head heats that culminate in a "Chopped"-style finale.
As competitors take the stage, attendees can sample drinks and cast a vote for a People's Choice award. Tickets, $40, include a cocktail sample from each participating bartender, neat spirits from sponsors and access to watch the competition.
Don't miss if... you're a booze hound or want to see some of the Valley's up-and-coming bartenders in action.
When: 3-6 p.m. Sunday, Feb. 17.
Details: $40. Portland Parkway Park, 1 W. Portland St., between First and Third avenues.
Seven Chefs Dinner Also on Sunday evening, top Valley chefs join forces for the annual Seven Chefs Dinner. Tickets, $175, include both food and drinks. Hosted at The Gladly restaurant in Phoenix, the multicourse meal will be prepared by seven chefs:
Jacob Cutino of Cutino Sauce Company.
Stephen Jones of The Larder + The Delta.
Bernie Kantak of The Gladly & Citizen Public House.
Scott Holmes of Little Miss BBQ.
Doug Robson of Gallo Blanco and Otro Cafe.
Justin Beckett of Beckett's Table and Southern Rail.
Country Velador of Super Chunk's New Wave Market.
Don't miss if... you'd love a chance to get up close and personal with some of our most talented chefs.
When: 4-7 p.m. Sunday, Feb. 17.
Details: $175. The Gladly, 2201 E. Camelback Road, Phoenix.
Devour The World In its second year, Devour The World is an evening event at the Japanese Friendship Garden. The downtown Phoenix garden makes a perfect backdrop for a night of multicultural cuisine from restaurants including:
Satay Hut.
Flavors of Louisiana.
El Chullo Peruvian Restaurant & Bar.
Pa'La.
Nelson's Meat + Fish.
Squid Ink Sushi.
Rezbot.
Don't miss if... you're looking for a tasting event that's more affordable and intimate than Devour Culinary Classic.
When: 6-9 p.m. Thursday, Feb. 21.
Where: $75. Japanese Friendship Garden, 1125 N. Third Ave., Phoenix.
Devour Culinary Classic Devour Week leads up to Devour Culinary Classic, a two-day festival that last year moved to the Desert Botanical Garden. The restaurants and chefs participating each day are often different, so check the Devour website before purchasing your ticket to make sure you don't miss your favorites.
Tickets, which generally sell out, start at $105 for the Tasting Package (or general admission). This includes one-day admission; access to most of the festival, which offers a beverage garden, wine-sale area and chef demos; a wine glass you get to take home; plus, of course, food tastings from dozens of local restaurants.
VIP tickets cost $205 and get you additional perks such as early access to the event (by 90 minutes); and admission to a VIP Hall with entertainment, exclusive food and drink offerings and seating, which is often hard to find at the festival. VIP ticket holders also can pick up a swag bag filled with local products in the VIP Hall, and get two tickets to come back and view the garden's Electric Desert exhibition.
Don't miss if... you want to experience the best of what the Phoenix food scene has to offer in one place as the Classic.
When: 11:30 a.m.-3:30 p.m. Saturday and Sunday, Feb. 23-24. (10 a.m. admission for VIP).
Details: $105-$205. Desert Botanical Garden, 1201 N. Galvin Parkway, Phoenix.

News isnt free, so we should pay

I have been a print subscriber to the Tampa Bay Times (and St. Pete Times) for close to 40 years. I applaud your decision to have an online pay meter. Everyone is well aware that the internet is available to all and is an immense market for revenue. My children have been teasing me for years about my need to read the paper in print form. (I always get their local papers when I visit). Comments like, Mom, you know you can read all this on the computer fall on deaf ears to me. Theres something about the feel and even the smell of holding a paper in my hand and even having to wash off the newsprint when Im done. Since I pay for the privilege of information it has always irked me that anyone else can get it all for free, but no more. So congratulations! Your top-rate, award-winning reporters, photographers and other staff deserve the recognition they get. To think that it doesnt take money to run an institution of that scope is unfair and clearly untrue. I look forward to many more years of reading my paper.

Cherryl Gleghorn, New Port Richey

Were a republic, after all

It is clear that the liberal and socialist talking points have been effective. To assume that the majority implies the will of the people eliminates the value of the minority. Our country is a constitutional republic because the Constitution protects the rights of the minority, while providing a representative government. The Electoral College was created for the same reason. If there were no Electoral College, presidential elections would be decided by six high-population states (California, Texas, Florida, New York, Pennsylvania and Illinois), giving no voice to the remaining 44 states. Majority rule has been described by Benjamin Franklin as two wolves and a sheep voting on what is for dinner. The word democracy doesnt even appear in either the Declaration of Independence or Constitution because, historically, pure democracies devolve into totalitarianism. We are a republic! We require engaged voters and honest public servants. But we get the government we deserve.

Scott Harrison, Apollo Beach

Rights dont exist in a vacuum

Regarding applying preservation laws: Developers claim that they are being denied their property rights, but their rights do not exist in a vacuum. Residents have legal rights when it comes to how St. Petersburg grows. We have zoning laws, which define what property owners can and cannot do with their property. But we also have laws pertaining to the preservation of historic properties and neighborhoods. We are all subject to these laws, whether our property is currently deemed historic or not. Our laws do not favor loss of perceived profit potential over loss of history and identity, nor should our press or city leaders.

Jonathan Kile, St. Petersburg

Fake news and whos failing?

Wouldnt it be ironic, if instead of President Donald Trump getting his wish that the failing New York Times goes out of business for exposing his crooked dealings, the National Enquirer goes out of business for trying to protect his crooked dealings?

WHAT'S NEW ON YOUR TV GEORGE CLOONEY RETURNS TO SERIES IN 'CATCH-22'; 'RESTORED BY THE FORDS' SEASON TWO DEBUTS IN MARCH

Texto completo: PASADENA, Calif.
The Joseph Heller satirical novel "Catch-22" has been adapted previously, most notably the 1970 Mike Nichols film, and actor/director George Clooney said he initially rejected the idea of acting in and directing a remake.
"Mike and I were friends and . [remaking it] seemed ridiculous; it's a beloved novel," Mr. Clooney said.
But the scripts by Luke Davies and David Michod persuaded him and producing partner Grant Heslov to get on board.
"[In a television series] you get to spend time with the characters like a book does," Mr. Clooney said. "They found a way to interpret it in a way we didn't think was even possible."
Hulu's six-episode, limited series "Catch-22" (May 17) follows Yossarian (Christopher Abbott, "Girls"), a World War II U.S. Air Force bombardier who comes upon contradictory military rules. He'd be considered insane if he continues to fly dangerous combat missions, but opting out proves he's sane, which makes him ineligible to escape combat. In addition to directing episodes, Mr. Clooney plays the serious Col. Cathcart.
Writer Luke Davies ("Lion") said he took a specific approach to adapting - kaleidoscoping - a novel that "jumps all over."
"I spent nine months in a room just trying to work out what happened in the novel in order," he said. "My first task was to work out the events. The second was to try to write it with truth and loyalty to the source material but allow both the darkness and the hilarity to stand on their own."
'Restored' gets premiere date
HGTV's "Restored by the Fords," featuring the brother-sister team of Leanne and Steve Ford restoring Pittsburgh homes, will be back for its second season at 9 and 9:30 p.m. March 19.
Steve, a licensed contractor, asks Leanne, an interior designer, to design Steve's bachelor pad in a 1940s warehouse space near Downtown.
A new digital series, "Ford Family Classics," will feature the siblings reviewing their childhood home movies beginning March 21 at HGTV.com and on HGTV's YouTube channel.
'Dance Moms' films locally
Abby Lee Miller, star of Lifetime's "Dance Moms," is back in Pittsburgh filming an eighth season of "Dance Moms" at her dance studio.
Now titled "Dance Moms: Resurrection," the show premieres at 8 p.m. June 4 on Lifetime with an hour devoted to Miller's physical and emotional struggles while undergoing chemotherapy and learning to use her legs again.
Miller was sentenced to prison in May 2017 for a year and a day for hiding $775,500 worth of income and bringing $120,000 in Australian currency into the U.S. without reporting it. After her release from prison in 2018, Ms. Miller was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
The new "Dance Moms" season - the first two episodes air back to back at 9 p.m. June 4 after the catch-up special - introduces a new cast of eight dancers and their moms, including one male dancer.
"I need to get back to Pittsburgh," Miller says in a trailer for the new season. "I need to get back to teaching. And I need to get back to screaming at children. I need to get back to my roots."
Kept/canceled/ordered
Disney Channel ordered "Zombies 2," a sequel to an original cable movie that premiered a year ago.
Premium cable outlet Epix ordered the six-part drama "Belgravia," written by "Downton Abbey" creator Julian Fellowes and based on his 2016 novel about secrets and dishonor in the upper echelon of 1800s London society.
Epix also ordered a six-part docuseries based on Slate's "Slow Burn" podcast with season one looking back on the Watergate crisis and its parallels to the present.
CBS renewed "Mom" for two seasons, Fox did the same for "The Simpsons," keeping both shows in production through the 2020-21 TV season.
History will bring back "Project Blue Book" for season two.
Lifetime has greenlit a sequel to its hit 2018 movie about Prince Harry and Meghan Markle. "Harry & Meghan: Becoming Royal," which will feature a new cast, chronicles the royal couple's first year as newlyweds.
"Running Wild With Bear Grylls" relocates from NBC to National Geographic Channel for a new season to air in December.
Nat Geo ordered a series adaptation of Tom Wolf's "The Right Stuff" with the first season beginning in 1958 and following the advent of the Mercury 7 astronauts.
TBS has scrapped plans for a revival of Michael Moore's "TV Nation."
Nat Geo will no longer devote its next installment of "Genius" to "Frankenstein" author Mary Shelley, pivoting to a season about singer Aretha Franklin that will be produced by Suzan-Lori Parks ("Topdog/Underdog") and will air in 2020.
Starz canceled "Counterpart" after two seasons.
Channel surfing
Premium cable network Epix has launched a $5.99 per month subscription streaming service, Epix Now, which requires no cable service. . "Warrior," a new series about a hatchet man for a San Francisco Chinese organized crime family from "Banshee" showrunner Jonathan Tropper, debuts at 10 p.m. April 5 on Cinemax. . BBC America will produce natural history series "Frozen Planet II" for 2021 and "Planet Earth III" for 2022. . Former CBS CEO Leslie Moonves, fired by CBS following accusations of sexual misconduct (relationships he says were consensual), has started a new company, Moon Rise Unlimited, that will focus on "entertainment services," per The New York Times.

Texto completo: The woman who has accused Virginia's lieutenant governor, Justin E. Fairfax, of raping her said that a former N.B.A. player, Corey Maggette, raped her at Duke University 20 years ago and that school officials did not pursue the claim, according to a childhood friend of the woman and Facebook messages the woman exchanged with another friend.
Mr. Maggette, who attended Duke for one year, 1998-99, and reached the national championship game, played in the N.B.A. until 2013 and has since worked as a television analyst for Fox Sports.
Mr. Maggette denied the accusation through a spokesman Monday evening. "It has only been through media accounts and a statement from Meredith Watson's lawyer that I first learned or heard of anything about these sexual assault allegations," Mr. Maggette said in a statement. "I have never sexually assaulted anyone in my life and I completely and categorically deny any such charge."
A spokeswoman for Fox Sports West, where Mr. Maggette is a basketball analyst, said in an email, "Fox Sports takes allegations of misconduct seriously, and we are looking into the matter. We have no further comment at this time."
Nancy Erika Smith, the lawyer for the woman who accused Mr. Maggette and Mr. Fairfax, Meredith Watson, said in a statement Friday that Ms. Watson had been raped by a Duke basketball player during her sophomore year but did not name the player. Ms. Smith also said that Ms. Watson had reported her rape to an unspecified dean at the university, but that the dean had "discouraged her from pursuing the claim further."
Duke has acknowledged it is investigating an allegation that a player raped the woman, but a spokesman for the university declined to comment on the identity of the player or the assertion that the university failed to act on the accusation.
"We are in the process of gathering information to determine what policies and procedures were in place during the time period in which these events are alleged to have occurred, and whether they were activated and followed," said Michael Schoenfeld, a spokesman for Duke. "We are not able to provide further information or comment on any individual at this time."
Years before Ms. Watson came forward as the second woman to publicly accuse Mr. Fairfax of sexual assault, inflaming a political crisis in Virginia, she told multiple friends that she had been raped by Mr. Maggette, according to one of those friends and Facebook messages exchanged with another.
R. Stanton Jones, a partner at the law firm Arnold & Porter in Washington who grew up with Ms. Watson in Baltimore, said she told him that she had been raped by Mr. Maggette. She told Mr. Jones about it while he and Ms. Watson were both home for the summer in 2001, he said.
"Meredith told me she had been raped twice at Duke," Mr. Jones said. "And she told me that one of the men who raped her was the Duke basketball player Corey Maggette. That was a name I knew because I'm a basketball fan."
Mr. Jones, who did not attend Duke, said he had not had much contact with Ms. Watson in the last decade "other than occasionally liking a Facebook post." He said he was coming forward now because it "seemed like the right thing to do."
The longtime coach of Duke's men's basketball team, Mike Krzyzewski, said after his team's victory against Virginia on Saturday night that he had "no knowledge" of the situation and that he had learned of it only from news media reports Friday.
Karen Kessler, a spokeswoman for Ms. Watson, provided The New York Times with a Facebook message exchange between Ms. Watson and a friend from March 2017. Ms. Kessler declined to identify the friend, whose name was blacked out in the messages, and The Times was unable to independently verify the authenticity of the messages.
In the messages, Ms. Watson expressed disgust at a newspaper article written about Mr. Fairfax, who had already announced his bid for lieutenant governor. After the friend asked Ms. Watson whether she had reported the rape, Ms. Watson responded: "You know I didn't report it after how the university responded when I reported Corey Maggette."
Ms. Kessler said that after being discouraged by the dean, Ms. Watson decided not to report her accusation to the police.
Mr. Krzyzewski -- who is in his 39th season coaching the Blue Devils and is college basketball's leader in wins -- and Duke have held themselves up not only as consummate winners but as moral exemplars.
No Duke player under Mr. Krzyzewski was kicked off the team until early 2015, when a player was dismissed for unspecified struggles to meet "necessary obligations." The university's student newspaper, The Duke Chronicle, reported that the player, Rasheed Sulaimon, had been accused of sexual assault by two students, allegations the athletics department had been aware of as early as 10 months before terminating his participation with the team. (Sulaimon was not charged, and later played for Maryland.)

Texto completo: Robert Ryman, a revered abstract artist who experimented with the most basic elements of painting - including the shape and material of a canvas, the fixtures that hold it to a wall and the movement of a brush over its surface - while working primarily with a single color, white, died Feb. 8 at his home in Manhattan. He was 88.
His death was confirmed by Susan Dunne, president of Pace Gallery in New York, which had long represented Mr. Ryman. She did not give the cause.
Wielding his brush like a prism, Mr. Ryman seemed to coax an entire rainbow out of white. Deceptively simple when seen from across a room, his canvases were generally muted squares of paint, offering little in the way of color or recognizable shapes.
On close inspection, they revealed themselves as dynamic, subtle and surprisingly moving creations, in which attention was focused on the paint itself, and on the inventive ways in which it was applied to surfaces of wood, fiberglass, steel or traditional canvas.
"It helps to think of Mr. Ryman as a kind of philosopher-carpenter with an inborn, almost mystical love of paint as paint," New York Times art critic Roberta Smith wrote in 2015. " 'Is this a painting?' 'Is that a painting?' could be taken as the main credo of his art," she added. "He doesn't always provide easy answers."
Mr. Ryman was widely regarded as one of the most influential American painters of the last half-century. Unlike many of his peers, he was not formally trained; his artistic schooling, such as it was, occurred in the 1950s while he was working as a security guard at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. Raised in Tennessee, he had come to Manhattan to pursue a jazz career as a tenor saxophonist, and he dined on canned beans and hamburgers while taking lessons with pianist Lennie Tristano.
The MoMA had initially served as a practice space, where he could play in the auditorium without fear of angering other tenants in his uptown apartment. But he was soon drawn to the works of Henri Matisse and especially Mark Rothko, the abstract expressionist whose paintings were sometimes attached directly to the wall, hung without a frame.
Mr. Ryman purchased brushes and paint and, not quite sure where or how to begin, started painting in the evenings after work. By the early 1960s he was a full-time artist, covering his canvas with reds and blues only to paint over everything with white.
"At one point I just decided: Well, I'm putting this color down, and I'm really not that interested in the color that I'm putting down," he said in a 1972 interview for the Smithsonian's Archives of American Art. "I'm only doing it because somehow being a painter I should use color. But here I am painting it out, so why not get this down a little stronger and not put the color on in the first place?"
Mr. Ryman was often described as a minimalist, alongside artists such as Robert Mangold and Donald Judd. He preferred the term "realist," saying that his paintings were not works of illusion, but pieces that relied on "real light and space," varying in appearance depending on their lighting and location in a gallery.
As part of his experimentation, he worked with a sweeping array of brushes and materials, applying oils, tempera, acrylics or casein paint to surfaces that included cotton, aluminum and cardboard. Alternating mediums, he played with the way heavy and lightweight surfaces hung on the wall, or the way a piece of wood gave a brown tinge to his paint.
He also tinkered with the heights of his paintings and employed unconventional fasteners, including plastic straps, aluminum tubing and strips of masking tape, which he considered no less a part of the work than the painting itself. By the 1980s, he was producing "three-dimensional paintings," including works of painted aluminum that thrust out of the wall.
"Gritty or silky, feathery or caked, tightly-woven or unraveling, each work's surface, like its particular cast of white and particular chromatic undertones or accents, is unique and immensely sensuous," MoMA curator Robert Storr wrote in the catalogue accompanying a 1993-94 retrospective of his work, organized jointly with the Tate Gallery in London.
Mr. Ryman, said Dia Art Foundation Director Jessica Morgan, "pushed the boundaries of what we think a painting is." A typical Ryman piece, she said in a phone interview, might feature unusual markings on its sides, or fixtures that are angled in different ways on each corner, or his signature - once viewed as a "passe gesture" - writ large on the canvas, or hidden in white-on-white paint.
While Mr. Ryman's work has become a staple of permanent collections around the world, his work has sometimes baffled viewers, including at a 2010 solo show at the Phillips Collection in Washington. At times, recalled senior curator Vesela Sretenovic, his canvases triggered an all-too-common response from viewers: Well, even I could paint that.
"What I said to visitors who could not get into the work is that it's not about stories, personal stories or specific narratives," Sretenovic said in an interview. "It's really hard to get people to take that in and make themselves comfortable."
Mr. Ryman's works, she added, were "about silence, and introspection. A silent world emerges through all these layers of paint."
Robert Tracy Ryman was born in Nashville on May 30, 1930. His father was an insurance salesman, his mother a schoolteacher who played piano.
Mr. Ryman attended the George Peabody College for Teachers in Nashville, where he studied music but did not receive a degree. After serving in an Army band, he moved to New York in 1952 and played bebop in Greenwich Village clubs. He was hired as a MoMA guard in 1953 and was soon joined on the museum's staff by several other emerging artists, including Dan Flavin, Sol LeWitt and Michael Venezia.
Mr. Ryman was featured in his first solo show in 1967, at the Paul Bianchini Gallery in New York, and five years later had a solo show at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum. More recently, he was featured in a 2015 retrospective at Dia's Chelsea gallery in Manhattan.
Mr. Ryman's first marriage, to Lucy R. Lippard, a MoMA colleague turned art critic, ended in divorce. In 1969, he married painter Merrill Wagner. In addition to his wife, survivors include a son from his first marriage, Ethan Ryman; two sons from his second, Will Ryman and Cordy Ryman; and six grandsons.All three of his children are artists.
While Mr. Ryman stopped short of calling himself an entertainer, he often said that pleasure - visceral or intellectual - was at the center of his work as a painter, no less than in his former life as a musician. In the MoMA catalogue, Storr quoted him as saying he wanted his viewers to enjoy "an experience of delight, and well-being and rightness."
To stand before his paintings, Mr. Ryman said, should be "like listening to music."

Texto completo: After Hurricane Katrina devastated the Gulf Coast in 2005, President George W. Bush declared a national emergency to do something Republicans had long wanted to do anyway: He suspended prevailing wage laws on federal contracts to rebuild the region.
Labor unions protested. Democrats signed on to a bill to rewrite the law. Even dozens of moderate Republicans asked Bush to reconsider.
But then a single congressman used a parliamentary maneuver – never attempted before or since – to challenge the underpinnings of the national emergency itself.
Bush backed down without even a vote.

The largely forgotten story of Bush's capitulation explains why Republicans have advised President Donald Trump against bypassing Congress and invoking a national emergency to build a wall along the Mexican border.
In addition to raising legal questions – such a move would inevitably be challenged in court – a declaration would invite Congress to exercise its long-dormant power to revoke national emergencies.
And all it would take is one member of Congress to force the issue.
In 2005, that member was Rep. George Miller, a California lawmaker who was the top Democrat on the House Education and Labor Committee.
Calling Bush's decision "callous and misguided," Miller's first move was to try to amend the Davis-Bacon Act of 1931. That law sets the prevailing wage for federal contracts, but allows the president to grant waivers in times of national emergency.
But Democrats were in the minority, and while some Republicans were grumbling about Bush's move, they were unwilling to sign on to Miller's legislation – meaning it would never get to the House floor.

So Miller changed tack. He dug up the National Emergencies Act of 1975, one in a series of post-Watergate reforms. It allowed Congress to terminate a presidential emergency by simple majority vote.
Republican leadership couldn't block the vote: Under the law, they had 15 business days to bring it out of committee and to the floor.
Miller introduced his resolution on Oct. 20, and a vote was scheduled for Nov. 8.
On Oct 26, the Bush administration announced it would terminate the emergency effective Nov. 7.
Bush Labor Secretary Elaine Chao said the administration had re-examined the issue and discovered that it wouldn't save as much money as initially forecast. (Chao remains a power in Washington: She's now Trump's transportation secretary, and her husband is Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. )
Miller declared victory.
"Let me be clear," he told The New York Times. "The president is backing down today only because he had no other choice. "
Mark Zuckerman, who was the Democratic staff director of the House Education and Labor at the time, says all it took was the threat of a vote.
"It can be revealing when you make people vote on something," he says.
"We thought it was an unacceptable and inappropriate use of emergency powers, but we also wanted to check to see if there was really Republican support for something like this. I think it’s part of the genius of the procedure is that it tests sentiment on Capitol Hill for your unilateral idea. "
The original intent of the 1975 law was to allow Congress a block a presidential emergency by simple majority vote. But in 1983, the U. S. Supreme Court struck down the legislative veto. So now, any joint resolution by Congress to terminate an emergency can be vetoed by the president.
And McConnell said Trump could do exactly that.
"The president could win anyway by vetoing the bill and then trying to get enough votes to sustain it, so may ultimately be able to prevail on the national emergency alternative," McConnell told Fox News on Tuesday.
Still, some GOP senators are already expressing discomfort over such a vote, and have asked Trump this week – both publicly and privately – not to put them in that position.
"It's not my preferred choice," said Sen. John Kennedy, R-La.
"I hope he doesn't do it," said. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas.
"It might be a – you know – a tough vote to win here in the Senate," said Sen. John Thune, R-S. D.
One concern is the precedent such a declaration would set.
"I think most Republicans will tell you that we really would like to find a way to avoid that type of a discussion if at all possible because this goes beyond just this president," Sen. Mike Rounds, R-S. D. , told CNN on Wednesday. "This goes on to future presidents and what they might decide to declare an emergency for. "

That was exactly what Congress expected when it voted overwhelmingly to pass the National Emergencies Act.
The law called for every emergency to be reviewed – and possibly voted on – every six months. But in 44 years, presidents have declared at least 60 national emergencies without Congress taking a single vote.
Thirty-one of those emergencies remain in place today.

The use of emergency powers became so routine that the Obama administration said in 2015 that they were mere formalities – despite their boilerplate language that they're in response to an "unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security. " And presidents seem to have ignored requirements that they update Congress on the costs of those emergencies.
More: The Obama White House claimed that national emergencies were just formalities
Liza Goitein, director of the national security program at the Brennan Center for Justice, has advocated reforms to presidential emergency powers.
"I think Congress has woken up to the idea that the process for declaring emergencies is too permissive," she says.
"This isn’t going to look good if the Republican Senate is voting to curtail the president's power. It’s going to split Republicans and force Republicans to take a vote they don’t want to take – and it may not go Trump's way. "
Trump did not mention the national emergency in his State of the Union address Tuesday, but says he's still considering it. A national emergency could allow him to transfer unspent military construction funds toward a wall.
"I don't like to take things off the table," Trump told CBS in a pre-Super Bowl interview. "It's that alternative. It's national emergency, it's other things and, you know, there have been plenty national emergencies called. "

Adam Schiff says Mueller investigation may be lacking in key area

Texto completo: House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff on Sunday questioned whether special counsel Robert Mueller has adequately investigated President Trump’s financial dealings with a German bank, thus reinforcing his case for a new Democrat-led House to begin its own inquiries into the president’s finances.

During an interview with NBC’s “Meet the Press,” the Democratic California congressman said his concerns stem from a New York Times report in April that said Trump tried to get Mueller fired after it was reported the special counsel had subpoenaed Deutsche Bank. That same report said Trump backed down only after Mueller's office told his advisers and lawyers that the reports were untrue.

The president has warned that Mueller’s investigators would be crossing a “red line” if they sought to investigate his personal finances and business dealings. Deutsche Bank provided loans to Trump in the 1990s after U.S. lenders opted against it following a flurry of bankruptcies.

“If the special counsel hasn’t subpoenaed Deutsche Bank, he can’t be doing much of a money laundering investigation,” Schiff said. “So that’s what concerns me, that that red line has been enforced, whether by the deputy attorney general [Rod Rosenstein] or by some other party at the Justice Department. But that leaves the country exposed.”

Schiff announced last week the House Intelligence Committee, now with him at the helm, would embark on a sweeping probe into Trump’s financial transactions and Russia.

Included in that investigative effort is a look at Trump’s financial ties to Deutsche Bank, which received an “inquiry” from the House Intelligence Committee and the House Financial Services Committee, led by Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif.

Schiff’s talk of investigations has prompted sharp rebukes from Trump, who last week called him a “political hack” who is engaging in “presidential harassment.”

Schiff defended the Intelligence Committee’s probe of Trump’s finances. “In terms of the president's business, we are not interested in our committee in whether he’s a tax cheat or not worth what he says he is,” Schiff said. “What we are interested in is, does the president have business dealings with Russia such that it compromises the United States?”

He also said the committee had no choice but to conduct another investigation parallel to Mueller’s rather than waiting for the special counsel’s office to finish its work.

“If we had waited to do any of our investigative work for the Mueller investigation, we would have been waiting a year and a half,” Schiff said. “And we have a separate and independent and important responsibility, and that is to tell the country what happened.”

Texto completo: Valeria Luiselli's newest novel, "Lost Children Archive," is a penetrating work that tells one family's complicated story as they drive cross-country from New York to Arizona, even as she deftly draws contemporary political and personal struggles together in the mix.
Born in Mexico, Luiselli grew up in South Korea, South Africa and India, and has enjoyed an award-winning career as a writer of both fiction and nonfiction works.
She has authored the novels "Faces in the Crowd," "The Story of My Teeth" and "Tell Me How It Ends: An Essay in Forty Questions," and the essay collection "Sidewalks." She has captured two Los Angeles Time Book Prizes, and an American Book Award; and is a two-time nominee for the National Book Critics Circle Award.
Luiselli's work has appeared in the New York Times, Granta, McSweeneys and other publications. She now lives in New York City.
Your new novel, "Lost Children Archive," chronicles a family's road trip from New York City to Arizona that served two purposes. The first was to provide research opportunities for both parents' projects as audio documentarians, with his focusing on the last leaders of the American Apache Indians, and hers on the child refugee crises from the court of immigration in New York. The journey was also a chance to share with their children some lessons of American history about the government's treatment of native Americans, as well as opportunities to personally experience what migrant children at the U.S. southern border were encountering. How did you develop the idea of this detailed and intense storyline?
When I begin a book, I have no idea of what I am going to do. I never think in terms of plot, or even overarching topics. All I have is a question, or perhaps a set of questions, and some intuitions about how to possibly explore them. One of the fundamental questions that drove me to write this novel had to do with the way that we tell stories to children, and in particular, the way we talk about history in relation to the present. And, in turn, the way that their internalization of those stories and versions of history may or may not make the world a less confusing and less terrifying place.
This novel, if anything, is about the process of composing stories, of threading voices and ideas together in an attempt to better understand the world around us. I don't see this as a novel about the refugee crisis, or about Apaches — but a novel about childhood, and the place of storytelling in the often daunting and sometimes solitary experience of being a child.
An important subplot in this narrative is the crisis within the family itself: the husband and wife, who are the parents of two children — all of whose names are never given — are in an unhappy marriage whose future is tenuous, at best. How does this affect the family dynamic during and after this trip, especially for the children?
I guess the crisis within the family, as they travel across the country inside their car, and the socio-political crisis unfolding around them, are in constant echo of each other. The novel is very much about the blurring of boundaries between our private sphere and the political/public realm.
We live in times where we can no longer draw a sharp division between the public and the private, between political life and family life. The two intersect and collide constantly, and we all have to figure out how to keep our feet on the ground and our heads clear.
Tell me about the decision of the main narrator (the mom) to change her documentary project from telling the story of "the crisis at the border" to that of the "lost," or "refugee" children.
More than a change it's a development prompted by her observations. She begins to pull on that thread when she starts spending time in the New York immigration court.
Then, as the family plans to drive southwest, and she begins to learn about the many layers of the crisis, she shifts her attention to the detention centers along the border. Finally, as she gets closer to the border, she starts thinking about all the children who cannot actually tell their story, who cannot actually be seen and cannot actually be heard — because they are either locked away indefinitely, or have gotten lost, or have lost their lives.
What the novel documents in this regard are simply the many layers of a crisis, and we travel through them, as readers, while the narrator herself is learning how to move across them.
During the course of the story, the couple's two young children become lost on a side trip that they set out on alone. They wind up experiencing circumstances similar to those of refugee children at the southern border of the United States. How did this experience ultimately influence the future of this family?
When I was writing "Lost Children Archive," I often found myself thinking about reenactment, both as a weird cultural practice — people reenacting historical moments — and as a more psychological, personal, internalized event, through which empathy for long-gone peoples and communities can perhaps be achieved.
In the novel, the children constantly reenact historical events, but they mix them all up with the present.
And in their confusion of past and present — especially the instances of brutal violence against Native Americans and the current treatment of undocumented people — they are able to understand political violence more clearly, and feel it in their own skin, so to speak.
Do you have other writing projects in the works at this time?
I'm doing research on mass incarceration and immigration detention. But I'm still in very early stages of the process, just taking notes, reading a lot, thinking. I have no idea what will come of it. And am not in a hurry.

Escalation fears increase in Syria

Texto completo: For years, Israel has quietly carried out air strikes against Iranian targets inside Syria. Recently, in a dramatic about-face, it began talking about it.
Concerned that the U.S. plan to withdraw from Syria would leave another border vulnerable to attack by Iran and its proxies, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's policy shift sends a clear message to external and domestic audiences as campaigning for parliamentary elections in April gets under way. It also increases the risk that the region will tumble into a new war.
"By being outspoken about these attacks, the Israelis are also provoking the Iranians into adopting a more aggressive posture themselves," said Heiko Wimmen, project director for Iraq, Syria and Lebanon at International Crisis Group.
A potentially dangerous new phase of Syria's civil war is taking shape as the major battles give way to strategic struggles over the country's future. Israel says it's determined to prevent Iran and its Lebanese ally Hezbollah from establishing a permanent base in Syria and may see a window of opportunity at a time when the Islamic Republic is weakened by U.S. sanctions. Analysts say Iran, too, sees in the American pullout a chance to expand its influence.
The new normal was on display late last month, when the Israeli military reported it had struck multiple Iranian targets in Syria, and hit Syrian air defenses after they fired at its planes. According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a monitoring group, 12 Iranian fighters and six Syrian soldiers were among 21 killed.
Iran responded by declaring it was ready to fight.
"If Israel does anything to touch off a new war, then that will be the war leading to its annihilation," Brig. Gen. Hossein Salami, deputy head of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, was quoted as saying by the semi-official Iranian Students' News Agency. "Our strategy is to wipe Israel from the political geography of the world and it appears that the perverse things Israel is doing will bring itself closer to this reality."
Chuck Freilich, a former Israeli deputy national security adviser, questioned Israel's wisdom in abandoning its policy of ambiguity.
"From our point of view we're doing what is totally justified in self-defense, but here we are flying around in Syrian airspace as if it's our own, no regime can allow that," Freilich said. "And then, if we talk about that in public that just makes it worse, that humiliates the Syrians."
Syria's envoy to the United Nations, Bashar Al Jaafari, raised the prospect of a retaliatory strike at a Security Council meeting in January, asking whether his country needed to practice "its legitimate right of self-defense and respond to Israel's aggression on the Damascus International Airport with a similar one on Tel Aviv airport?"
Days before he left office in January, military chief Gadi Eisenkot told The New York Times that Israel had struck thousands of Iranian targets over the past two years. And Netanyahu said Israel has hit hundreds of targets belonging to Iran and Hezbollah, whose fighters are also propping up Syrian President Bashar Assad.
In the 12 years since Israel and Hezbollah last warred, the Lebanese group has built up an arsenal of as many as 150,000 missiles, according to some Israeli estimates. Israel says a permanent Iranian military presence in Syria would give the Islamic Republic an uninterrupted weapons conduit from Tehran to Beirut.
An Israeli government spokesman declined to comment on the new openness. But analysts say Netanyahu, who's seeking a fifth term in office in the face of potential corruption charges, may be working to cement his reputation as a capable defender of Israel's security interests.
Yet Israel's talkativeness could also complicate relations with Russia, whose entry into the war turned the tide in Assad's favor. Ties have been strained over the past year by the downing of Israeli and Russian warplanes in the crossfire of Israel-Iran jousting in Syria. After Israel's strike on Jan. 28, a Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said Israel's "practice of arbitrary strikes" should be "ruled out."
Former Israel air force commander Amir Eshel, who stepped down in 2017, told a security conference recently that "the only one who can get Iran out of Syria is Russia." And as Israel expands its operations there, "there's a risk that the Russians will turn on us too," he said.
"Netanyahu is calculating or miscalculating that Iran would not retaliate against his attacks in Syria," said Fawaz Gerges, a London School of Economics professor of international relations. "I could easily imagine a scenario whereby Iran or its allies retaliate against Israeli attacks, triggering all-out war."

In blog post, a rare public statement for private leader

Texto completo: Jeffrey P. Bezos has long guarded his personal privacy and that of his businesses with vehemence. Amazon kept major initiatives, such as the Kindle e-reader, secret for years. His space venture, Blue Origin, once had a rocket crash but didn't report the mishap for days. Visitors to the space company's headquarters have been routinely asked to sign nondisclosure agreements, even if just visiting for a holiday party.
This quest for privacy imploded in recent weeks as Bezos, the world's wealthiest man and the owner of The Washington Post, faced perhaps the most personal crisis of his career. The National Enquirer published a series of stories, including intimate texts and photos, about his extramarital relationship with a former TV anchor, prompting Bezos and his wife of 25 years, MacKenzie Bezos, to announce their planned divorce over Twitter.
Then, according to a blog post Bezos published Thursday, the tabloid threatened to blackmail him with additional photographs of Bezos and the woman he was dating. He responded in
the blog post by including copies of Enquirer emails detailing the alleged threat. The move revealed graphic descriptions of what the images showed.
The Enquirer on Friday said it had only been engaged in "good faith negotiations to resolve all matters with him" and would investigate the claims by Bezos before taking "whatever appropriate action is necessary."
The blog post Thursday night startled many in the technology industry and beyond, quickly spreading to internal online forums at Amazon, the company he founded in 1994 and for which he remains chief executive, board chairman and the largest shareholder.
But some longtime associates and observers also considered his confrontation with the Enquirer to be a classic Bezos move. As Amazon's CEO, he has relished the chance to rewrite the script when it came to managing public relations. Perhaps even more so, he has thrived on seeking to vanquish rivals, whether they be corporate behemoths such as Walmart or upstarts such as Diapers.com. With the Enquirer, Bezos has twice seized the initiative by essentially scooping the tabloid, revealing news of his divorce and of the additional pictures before its reporters could.
Even as the controversy has grown, Bezos has been spotted in public settings looking jovial, as he did when he appeared briefly on national television during the Super Bowl, standing and chatting near NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell. He appeared last month at the annual dinner of the Alfalfa Club in Washington, a black-tie event that attracts some of the city's biggest names.
"He is playing his hand as well as he can, given what has been made public," said Shel Kaphan, the first Amazon employee after Bezos and his wife. The "damage is done and I think he probably calculates correctly that it isn't going to get measurably worse for him if the photos come out."
Kaphan added, "It would be very typical of Jeff to strategically weigh his options in a detached way and pick the one that would leave him in the best position or minimize further damage to him."
Bezos, who declined an interview request made through Amazon officials Friday, typically is described as cerebral, ruthless and relentless as a businessman, with a particular ability to focus on long-term goals in the face of short-term pain.
Bezos and his company have faced multiple controversies during his public life. In Amazon's early years, it faced skepticism over whether the company could ever turn a profit and survive. But he relentlessly focused on underpricing competitors and other customer innovations, earning the trust of investors that one day Amazon would make money.
In 2015, when the New York Times published a detailed investigation describing a "bruising" workplace culture at Amazon, the company responded with a 1,300-word blog post detailing what the company argued were flaws in the story's reporting. Jay Carney, Amazon's senior vice president for global corporate affairs and former press secretary to President Barack Obama, titled the response, "What The New York Times Didn't Tell You," and engaged in an tit-for-tat exchange with the Times's executive editor over the coverage.
In more recent years, as lawmakers have raised questions about whether Amazon was compensating its workers enough and other aspects of its business model, the company made announcements of plans to hire 100,000 new workers and, later, to introduce a $15 minimum wage. Amazon spent $14 million on lobbying last year, a record for the company.
Bezos in recent years has raised his public profile. He bought The Post and the biggest home in Washington, and has appeared at entertainment award shows and high-profile rocket launches. He even drew attention for a more muscular physique and more refined wardrobe than earlier in his life.
His ownership of The Post has led to clashes with candidate and now President Trump, who has argued that the Amazon founder bought The Post to advance his financial interests. When Trump was a candidate in December 2015 and criticized Bezos in several tweets, he replied on Twitter. "Finally trashed by @realDonaldTrump. Will still reserve him a seat on the Blue Origin rocket. #sendDonaldtospace."
He largely has avoided further clashes with Trump, though he has said it is wrong of elected officials "to demonize the media."
Trump has from time to time continued to criticize Bezos. After the Enquirer published its article on Bezos's expected divorce, Trump tweeted, "So sorry to hear the news about Jeff Bozo being taken down by a competitor whose reporting, I understand, is far more accurate than the reporting in his lobbyist newspaper, the Amazon Washington Post. Hopefully the paper will soon be placed in better & more responsible hands!"
In publicly challenging the Enquirer, Bezos gambled in a way that's rare in a corporate world where the more common approach could be to protect valuable businesses from controversies before they might spread in unpredictable ways. The stakes are particularly high for a man who has drawn the ire of an aggressive publisher that thrives on controversy and whose chief executive is David J. Pecker, a longtime friend of Trump. Pecker has received immunity from prosecution as part of the Justice Department's investigation into campaign finance violations by Trump's former personal lawyer, Michael Cohen.
Bezos wrote in the post on Medium, a self-publishing site, "If in my position I can't stand up to this kind of extortion, how many people can?"
The accusations about the Enquirer's reporting came at a critical time for Bezos's empire, which increasingly has sought to work with the federal government. Amazon Web Services, which holds a $600 million cloud computing contract from the CIA, is vying for a $10 billion contract to build a cloud computing system for the Pentagon. Late last year, Blue Origin won its first major government contract, a $500 million deal from the Air Force to help develop its New Glenn rocket.
"As a billionaire, he can afford to take the risk to respond this way," said Jim Lukaszewski, a crisis consultant based in Minneapolis. "He skipped all the steps that get people in trouble . . . This neutralizes the power of this predator."
Bezos, who bought The Post in 2013 for $250 million, said in his online post Thursday that owning the news organization is "a complexifier" in his decisions about how to respond to political and other pressure. At a technology conference in 2016, he said that he admired Katharine Graham, the Post's late publisher who supported the newsroom's Watergate coverage even when a Nixon associate threatened that she was "gonna get her tit caught in a big fat wringer" if a particular story was published.
"With Kay Graham as my role model, I'm very willing to let any of my body parts go through a big, fat ringer if need be," Bezos said at the conference.
However this clash with the Enquirer turns out, it has revealed elements of Bezos's personality not widely known before, including a degree of personal indiscretion that has surprised longtime associates and observers.
Bezos and his romantic partner, former TV anchorwoman Lauren Sanchez, appeared together in public, including at the Golden Globe Awards, before publicly announcing an end to his marriage to MacKenzie Bezos, a fiction writer who helped him found Amazon. The couple have four children together.
While extramarital affairs are hardly novel, some Bezos watchers expressed surprise that he would send provocative text messages given the ease of copying and sharing them with others.
Bezos amassed a fortune of more than $125 billion running a technology company at a time when such breaches of personal privacy were becoming routine. Bezos long has preached within Amazon that personal actions by employees - and there is no more visible one than Bezos - can reflect poorly on a company, said his biographer Brad Stone, author of "The Everything Store."
"It's kind of inexplicable considering his messages inside the company," Stone said. "This was somebody who has been careful and strategic about every move in his personal and professional life over 50-plus years."
Once the affair was exposed, Bezos's response comes right out of the playbook of his longtime security consultant, Gavin de Becker. In "The Gift of Fear," he wrote that "extortion is a crime of opportunity, usually committed by amateurs."
De Becker added that when someone threatens to reveal marital infidelity, the best response is to say, "Hold on a moment, let me get my wife on the line and you can tell her right now."
The immediate pain, he wrote, is better than a prolonged period of blackmail during which the damaging information may ultimately be revealed anyway.
For much of his career, Bezos personally avoided the limelight, and the penchant for secrecy extended to his company and to his philanthropic endeavors. Until 2018, when he announced a $2 billion commitment to support preschoolers and the homeless, he had said very little about what he planned to do with his fortune.
Bezos also is known for staying silent on quarterly earnings calls with analysts and investors, and the company has banned recording, typing and photography at its shareholder meetings. Reporters at such meetings were allowed only to take handwritten notes.
"I never think of us as secretive," Bezos once said at a meeting in response to questions about these practices. "We're just quiet . . . We talk when we have something to say."
Blue Origin, his space company, also has kept a low profile, even though space is one of his main passions and now comprises, as he has said, "the most important work I'm doing." That included not revealing a 2011 crash until urged to by NASA, which had begun to worry about conspiracy theories spreading among those who noticed that something had gone awry.
In the early 2000s, Bezos started quietly acquiring hundreds of thousands of acres in West Texas, where Blue Origin now launches its New Shepard rocket. He purchased the land under corporate entities named for explorers. There was Joliet Holdings and Cabot Enterprises, the James Cook and William Clark Limited Partnerships and Coronado Ventures.
All were linked to a firm with a Seattle post office called Zefram LLC, named for Zefram Cochrane, a character in the Star Trek franchise. As he was scouting the land, a helicopter carrying Bezos crash-landed in a creek, flooding the cabin with water before he and others could escape. Later, he would say that "it was harrowing. We were very lucky. I can't believe we all walked away from it."
At the time, Amazon downplayed the crash, saying only that Bezos "is fine. We're business as usual."

Texto completo: All statewide officials in the Commonwealth of Virginia should resign if Democrats are held to their own standards.
Even if Gov. Ralph Northam didn't appear in blackface in an image in his medical-school yearbook, he confessed to once darkening his face as part of a Michael Jackson costume.
Attorney General Mark Herring, who called Northam’s conduct indefensible, also used blackface once. Meanwhile, Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax has been accused of sexual assault.
If ever wearing blackface — even in the 1980s, as both Northam and Herring did — is a career-ender, and if we are supposed to “believe all women,” then all three of these Democrats have to go.
Virginia is an indication of an inflamed and unforgiving Democratic mood that will define the party's battle for the 2020 presidential nomination.
Democrats are about to embark on the first "woke" primary, a gantlet of political correctness that will routinely wring abject apologies out of candidates and find fault in even the most sure-footed. The passage of time will be no defense. Nor the best of intentions. Nor anything else.
Any lapses will be interpreted through the most hostile lens, made all the more brutal by the competition of a large field of candidates vying for the approval of a radicalized base. The Democrat nomination battle might as well be fought on the campus of Oberlin College and officiated by the director of the Office of Equity, Diversity and Inclusion.
Being a progressive hero of long-standing doesn't afford any protection. Consider Elizabeth Warren. She certainly deserves all the grief she gets for her laughable identification of herself over the years as an American Indian. But for the identity-politics left, her fault runs deeper.
After taking a DNA test to prove her (distant) Native American ancestry, she stood accused, in the words of a member of a tribe in South Dakota, of "privileging nonindigenous definitions of being indigenous." According to The New York Times, she had also tread "too far into the fraught area of racial science — a field that has, at times, been used to justify the subjugation of racial minorities and Native Americans."
Yes, Warren stood exposed as implicitly in league with the oppressors of Native Americans — and here she had just wanted Donald Trump to stop calling her Pocahontas. Cherokee Nation activist Rebecca Nagle told CNN last week that Warren needed to apologize "to the tribes that she has harmed and to Native people broadly."
Sure enough, she apologized, and presumably will keep on doing it as long as she's running.
It's a season of apologies. When recently announced candidate Kirsten Gillibrand went on "The Rachel Maddow Show," the MSNBC host hit her for having in the past used the term "illegal alien," although it was standard and technically correct usage. Gillibrand allowed that she was embarrassed by her past positions on immigration.
In this environment, being a white male, particularly a white male not obsessed with gender and race, is a risk factor. This is a major vulnerability of Bernie Sanders'.
Segments of the left jumped on him this week for doing his own State of the Union response after the official reply by the African-American activist Stacey Abrams. Marc Lamont Hill called Sanders' choice "racially tone-deaf."
In every presidential campaign, candidates have to explain and backfill to get with the party's latest program. What will make this process so much more intense for Democrats is the belief that even past mistakes involving the choice of words or symbolism are affirmatively injurious of other people. And that such mistakes represent deep sins to be repented of.
Even Kamala Harris, who calls racism, sexism and transphobia matters of "national security," isn't safe. She was once a prosecutor, after all. Reviewing her record, a New York Times op-ed writer said that "she needs to radically break with her past."
Who doesn't? No one will be woke enough to emerge from this process unscathed.

Americans need to see Trump's taxes

Texto completo: Far from a witch hunt or partisan political attack, Democratic congressional efforts to obtain President Donald Trump's tax returns are a necessary exercise of legislative oversight responsibility. The president's returns, and those of his 500 businesses, could answer essential questions about his fitness for office, and serve as an invaluable guide to what needs fixing in our tax code. Congress has a duty to pursue both investigations, and do so promptly.
On Thursday, the House Ways and Means Oversight Subcommittee will hold a hearing on a proposal to require presidents and presidential candidates to release their tax returns. But Congress already has the duty and the right to obtain Trump's tax returns. Under a 1924 law enacted in the wake of another administration marked by legal challenges and potential conflicts of interest, the chair of each of three tax-focused committees has the authority to obtain the tax returns of any U.S. citizen, including the president.
Congress should act with urgency because it's likely Trump will resist its efforts. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who would ultimately decide on whether to honor a request for Trump's taxes, has been noncommittal, saying only that he "will review any request with the Treasury general counsel for legality." That could set up a legal challenge that might last months if not years, perhaps even past the 2020 election.
But voters deserve answers now, well before the next presidential election. Here's why.
The law is broken and now it benefits Trump First, a review of Trump's taxes would highlight defects in our tax laws, as explained in a recent report from our organization. As a billionaire who has apparently paid zero federal income taxes in multiple years, Trump could serve as an illustrative example of how the wealthy are able to avoid paying their fair share and help spur urgently needed reform.
Second, we need to know whether and how much Trump personally gains from the tax policies he promotes and signs into law. We estimate that he and his family could save as much as $22 million from the Trump-GOP tax cuts enacted in 2017. Citizens have a right to know whether their leaders are pursuing policies for their private benefit instead of the public interest.
Another important issue is whether Trump has violated federal law by illegally evading taxes or has shown a disregard for his obligation to pay his fair share by engaging in flagrant tax dodging. Last year, The New York Times published an exhaustive report on "dubious" tax avoidance strategies pursued by Trump's family over the past half-century, including what the newspaper declared to be "instances of outright fraud."

Fundraiser for Jayme Closs and family sets new goal of $150K

Texto completo: An online fundraiser set up for Jayme Closs and her family has tripled its goal after raising almost $50,000 since the abducted girl's return, with donations coming from all over the country.
Angela De Andriano created the GoFundMe campaign on Jan. 11 — the day 13-year-old Jayme was reunited with her family after her parents were murdered and she went missing for 88 days. On Thursday, De Andriano upped the fundraiser's goal to $150,000.
According to the GoFundMe account, De Andriano is the niece of Sue Allard, Jayme's aunt.
Allard's sister Denise Closs was shot to death in her own home in Barron on Oct. 15 as she tried to hide with Jayme in a bathroom, police say. Jayme's father, James Closs, had just been shot through the front door and killed by 21-year-old Jake Patterson, according to prosecutors.
Patterson then put the young girl in the trunk of his car and took her to his home in Douglas County and kept her under his bed, threatening to harm her if she tried to escape, according to a criminal complaint.
Jayme was able to run from the home on Jan. 10.
The Facebook page "Healing for Jayme Closs" confirmed the fundraiser set up by De Andriano is legitimate. The money will go directly to the family to use for "medical appointments, general care, or any other basic needs Jayme may have going forward,"De Andriano wrote on the GoFundMe page.
"Every dollar is a blessing," De Andriano wrote. "Thank you all."
Nearly 1,000 people from around the world made donations big and small to the campaign. An anonymous donor contributed $5,000, the largest single gift to the campaign.
Allison Lattanze, a mother of two teens from Pennsylvania who donated $50 to the GoFundMe page, told a USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin reporter that she wanted to help the Closs family in any way she could, since the case felt personal to her as a mother.
"It's important for a lot of us who were following the case to let Jayme know that people really care and wish her well," Lattanze said.
Greg Lara, who lives in New York, said that he first heard about Jayme's case and the fundraiser from a story in The New York Times that was shared on Facebook. He said he "just felt compelled to contribute."
"I was very moved by the poor girl's story; it's such a horrible thing to lose both your parents that way," said Lara, who gave $25. "I thought that someone in her (and her family's) situation will need all the help she can get."
Hormel Foods announced in January that the company would be donating its half of the $50,000 reward promised for Jayme's safe return to the teen for her "bravery and strength." Hormel Foods owns the Jennie-O Turkey Store in Barron, where Jayme's parents worked up to the day they died.
In an update posted at the end of January, Jayme's aunt and legal guardian Jennifer Smith thanked the donors for their "love and support."
"Jayme is doing pretty good," Smith said. "We love to see her smile and even more, laugh with a few of her close friends. It's the best feeling ever. We have a long road of healing and recovery as we move forward; small steps."

Texto completo: White House won't send report to Congress on slain journalist
WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration was set to ignore a Friday deadline for giving the Senate a full accounting of the role of Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, in the brutal slaying of U.S.-based Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi four months ago.
The administration, which has consistently sought to shield Saudi rulers from blame, had until midnight Friday to answer senators' questions about whether Prince Mohammed ordered the killing, as U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded, and what additional sanctions should be placed on the government in Riyadh.
The deadline was set by Democratic and Republican senators, who wrote the president on Oct. 10 -- slightly more than a week after Khashoggi's disappearance -- calling for an investigation.
Senators said Trump was obliged by law to answer within 120 days. Administration officials contended, however, that the law was not binding and that the president could ignore the senators' demands.
A top Saudi official, Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Adel Al-Jubeir, on Friday insisted the crown prince had no role in Khashoggi's slaying, saying the trial of the suspects and the ongoing investigation would show it was a "rogue operation" with no official backing.
The New York Times reported Thursday that U.S. intelligence agencies intercepted a 2017 conversation in which Mohamed told a top aide that he would use "a bullet" on Khashoggi, a regime critic, if he did not return home to Saudi Arabia.

Fire at Brazilian soccer academy kills 10, injures 3
RIO DE JANEIRO -- Fire tore through the sleeping quarters of an academy for one of Brazil's most popular professional soccer clubs Friday, killing 10 people and injuring three, most likely teenage players, authorities said.
Firefighters were called just after 5 a.m. local time to the sprawling Ninho de Urubu training grounds of the Flamengo soccer club in Rio de Janeiro.
The cause of the fire was not known.
Those killed were not immediately identified by the club but they were athletes, a health official said.
Two of the injured youths were hospitalized in stable condition and one was in critical condition. The ages of the injured were 14, 15 and 16, according to a fire official.
Several people who appeared to be relatives entered the complex without speaking to reporters.

Stone says he should be free to speak in Russia probe case
WASHINGTON -- A federal judge shouldn't bar longtime Donald Trump confidant Roger Stone from making public statements about his criminal case in the Russia investigation, his attorneys said Friday.
Defense lawyers say in a court filing that any limits on Stone's public comments would infringe on his right to free speech.
They made the argument as U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson is considering a gag order preventing both sides in the case from making public statements that could prejudice potential jurors.
Jackson raised the issue last week as she told Stone not to treat his criminal case like a "book tour," referring to post-indictment talk show appearances Stone made in which he attacked the investigation as politically motivated.

Iran's top leader defends chants of 'Death to America' by crowds
TEHRAN, Iran -- Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei is defending "Death to America" chants that are standard fare at anti-U.S. rallies across Iran but says the chanting is aimed at America's leaders and not its people.
Khamenei's website on Friday quoted him as saying the chant means "death to U.S. leaders, death to (President Donald) Trump and John Bolton and (Mike) Pompeo."
He says the Iranian people "will not stop saying 'Death to America' as long as the U.S. acts malicious" toward Iran.
Khamenei was referring to Trump's State of the Union address this week in which the American president, among other things, said: "We will not avert our eyes from a regime that chants 'Death to America.' "

France presses Italy in historic EU dispute
PARIS -- France's pro-EU government and Italy's populist leaders sparred anew Friday amid the neighbors' biggest diplomatic spat since World War II.
French officials said Friday that this week's recall of French Ambassador Christian Masset was prompted by months of "unfounded attacks" from Italian government members Luigi Di Maio and Matteo Salvini, who have criticized French President Emmanuel Macron's economic and migration policies.
But the main trigger for the crisis appeared to be Di Maio's meeting in a Paris suburb this week with members of the yellow vests -- a French anti-government movement seeking seats in the European Parliament -- without informing French leaders, who considered it an unwarranted intrusion into the nation's internal affairs.

Steep fall in enforcement by EPA seen since 2016
WASHINGTON -- Civil and criminal crackdowns on polluters dropped sharply in the second year of the Trump administration, according to 2018 enforcement figures released Friday by the Environmental Protection Agency.
The Trump administration EPA says the agency is taking a new tack with polluters, giving states more of a role in regulation and enforcement and stressing education and voluntary compliance with offenders as well as fines and criminal prosecution.
The EPA has been one of the most active agencies overall in carrying out the deregulatory goals of President Donald Trump.
Declines include civil investigations carried out by the agency, which fell to 22 last year, down from 40 in 2017 and 125 in 2016, the last year of the Obama administration.

Health exam: President Donald Trump is "in very good health" and expected to remain healthy for "the duration of his Presidency, and beyond," the president's doctor said Friday after a physical exam by 11 specialists. The White House did not release more details and did not say whether any would be released.

Summit location: President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un will hold their second summit in the Vietnamese capital of Hanoi on Feb. 27-28, the president said Friday night. The president had previously announced Vietnam as the summit location, but the city hadn't been identified.

DONALD TRUMP VERSUS THE SOCIALIST MENACE NO, THE COMMIES ARE NOT COMING FOR YOUR PICKUP TRUCKS; AMERICA'S SOCIAL DEMOCRATS ARE SHOOTING FOR DENMARK, NOT VENEZUELA

Texto completo: In 1961, America faced what conservatives considered a mortal threat: calls for a national health insurance program covering senior citizens. In an attempt to avert this awful fate, the American Medical Association launched what it called Operation Coffee Cup, a pioneering attempt at viral marketing.
Here's how it worked: Doctors' wives (hey, it was 1961) were asked to invite their friends over and play them a recording in which Ronald Reagan explained that socialized medicine would destroy American freedom. The housewives, in turn, were supposed to write letters to Congress denouncing the menace of Medicare.
Obviously the strategy didn't work; Medicare not only came into existence, but it became so popular that these days Republicans routinely (and falsely) accuse Democrats of planning to cut the program's funding. But the strategy - claiming that any attempt to strengthen the social safety net or limit inequality will put us on a slippery slope to totalitarianism - endures.
And so it was that President Donald Trump, in his State of the Union address, briefly turned from his usual warnings about scary brown people to warnings about the threat from socialism.
What do Mr. Trump's people, or conservatives in general, mean by "socialism"? The answer is, it depends.
Sometimes it means any kind of economic liberalism. Thus after the SOTU, Steven Mnuchin, the treasury secretary, lauded the Trump economy and declared that "we're not going back to socialism" - i.e., apparently America itself was a socialist hellhole as recently as 2016. Who knew?
Other times, however, it means Soviet-style central planning, or Venezuela-style nationalization of industry, never mind the reality that there is essentially nobody in American political life who advocates such things.
The trick - and "trick" is the right word - involves shuttling between these utterly different meanings, and hoping that people don't notice. You say you want free college tuition? Think of all the people who died in the Ukraine famine! And no, this isn't a caricature: Read the strange, smarmy report on socialism that Mr. Trump's economists released last fall; that's pretty much how its argument goes.
So let's talk about what's really on the table.
Some progressive U.S. politicians now describe themselves as socialists, and a significant number of voters, including mostvoters under 30, say they approve of socialism. But neither the politicians nor the voters are clamoring for government seizure of the means of production. Instead, they've taken on board conservative rhetoric that describes anything that tempers the excesses of a market economy as socialism, and in effect said, "Well, in that case I'm a socialist."
What Americans who support "socialism" actually want is social democracy: A market economy, but with extreme hardship limited by a strong social safety net and extreme inequality limited by progressive taxation. They want us to look like Denmark, not Venezuela.
And in case you haven't been there, the Nordic countries are not, in fact, hellholes. They have somewhat lower GDP per capita than we do, but that's largely because they take more vacations. Compared with America, they have higher life expectancy, much less poverty and significantly higher overall life satisfaction. Oh, and they have high levels of entrepreneurship - because people are more willing to take the risk of starting a business when they know that they won't lose their health care or plunge into abject poverty if they fail.
Mr. Trump's economists clearly had a hard time fitting the reality of Nordic societies into their anti-socialist manifesto. In some places they say that the Nordics aren't really socialist; in others they try desperately to show that despite appearances, Danes and Swedes are suffering - for example, it's expensive for them to operate a pickup truck. I am not making this up.
What about the slippery slope from liberalism to totalitarianism? There's absolutely no evidence that it exists. Medicare didn't destroy freedom. Stalinist Russia and Maoist China didn't evolve out of social democracies. Venezuela was a corrupt petrostate long before Hugo Chávez came along. If there's a road to serfdom, I can't think of any nation that took it.
So scaremongering over socialism is both silly and dishonest. But will it be politically effective?
Probably not. After all, voters overwhelmingly support most of the policies proposed by American "socialists," including higher taxes on the wealthy and making Medicare available to everyone (although they don't support plans that would force people to give up private insurance - a warning to Democrats not to make single-payer purity a litmus test).
On the other hand, we should never discount the power of dishonesty. Right-wing media will portray whomever the Democrats nominate for president as the second coming of Leon Trotsky, and millions of people will believe them. Let's just hope that the rest of the media report the clean little secret of American socialism, which is that it isn't radical at all.

Texto completo: Izzy Young, a businessman, political activist and founding patron of the Greenwich Village folk music scene who organized Bob Dylan's first major New York concert and devoted decades to supporting other musicians, died Feb. 4 at his home in Stockholm. He was 90.
His daughter, Philomène Grandin, confirmed the death but did not give a precise cause.
Starting in the 1950s, the neighborhood of Greenwich Village was the center of a folk music revival that helped launch the careers of Dylan, Joni Mitchell and many others. Mr. Young, as much as anyone, made the revival possible.
In 1957, he opened the Folklore Center, where fans and folk performers would stop by for everything from old sheet music to obscure music books. In a memoir, "Chronicles," Dylan described it as "the citadel of Americana folk music."
"It was like an ancient chapel," he added, "like a shoe box sized institute."
In 1960, Mr. Young decided to expand folk music beyond coffee houses and brought it to an Italian restaurant called Gerde's.
When Dylan moved from Minnesota to New York in the winter of 1961, Gerde's was an early stop. He played his first professional gig there, in April; five months later, Robert Shelton's review in the New York Times established Dylan as a rising star and brought him his first record deal.
Mr. Young organized Dylan's first major show outside of Greenwich Village, a November 1961 performance at Carnegie Chapter Hall, a small venue connected to the venerable Carnegie Hall.
Mr. Young also gave early breaks to other top folk and folk-rock performers, including Mitchell, John Sebastian of the Lovin' Spoonful, and Peter, Paul and Mary. He wrote a column for the folk music publication Sing Out! and helped organize a 1961 protest - known and misnamed as "the Beatnik Riot" - after Parks Commissioner Newbold Morris stopped issuing permits for folk musicians in Washington Square Park.
The demonstration began as a peaceful gathering but ended with some protesters shoved to the ground, and others carted off to jail. The city soon resumed allowing folkies in the park.
A film of the event showed Mr. Young telling police that it was not up to "Commissioner Morris to tell the people what kind of music is good or bad. He's telling people folk music brings degenerates, but it's not so."
Israel Goodman Young was born March 26, 1928 in Manhattan. He worked at his family's bakery in Brooklyn and attended high school in the Bronx. After joining the American Square Dance Group, he developed the idea that "folk music is the heartbeat of a person," as he once told the Village Voice.
In 1973, he turned his store over to Rick Altman and settled in Stockholm, enamored of Swedish music and predicting that the country's cultural scene could soon surpass that of New York. He opened a new music shop, the Folklore Centrum, which closed in November.
"He had opened his heart to so many people, so many poets who came to his shop," Grandin told the Associated Press. She spent several months last year cataloguing and packing up Mr. Young's library of some 2,000 titles, with a view to selling it as one collection.
In addition to his daughter, survivors include a son and three grandchildren.

Texto completo: There were still some balcony tickets available at press time for Arlo Guthrie's show at Maryland Hall for the Creative Arts on Sunday night.
The folk troubadour is on the road celebrating the 50th anniversary of his hit "Alice's Restaurant Massacree" and the movie made of the hit. The "Back by Popular Demand Alice's Restaurant" tour coincides with the 50th anniversary of the 1969 release of the film, "Alice's Restaurant," directed by Arthur Penn who garnered a best director Oscar nomination.
Guthrie, like his father Woody Guthrie became known for protest songs against injustice, wrote the song as a satirical jab against the Vietnam War era draft. The 18- minute story is very loosely based on a real event in Guthrie's early life. The song explains how his arrest for dumping trash keeps him from being drafted because of his criminal record.
"I didn't think I was gonna live long enough to have to learn 'Alice's Restaurant' again," Arlo Guthrie said, joking in a press release. "It was a quirky kinda thing to begin with. Nobody writes an 18-minute monologue expecting fame and fortune. The initial success of the song really took me by surprise more than anyone else."
Last year the Library of Congress selected the song to be included in the National Recording Registry which honors and preserves songs with cultural, historic and aesthetic importance to the American soundscape.
Guthrie, will be joined onstage by longtime collaborators from his former band Shenandoah,Terry "A La Berry" Hall on drums, Steve Ide on guitar and vocals and percussionist Carol Ide who also sings.
Arlo's daughter Sarah Lee Guthrie, a lauded singer-songwriter in her own right, will open the show.
Tickets for the 8 p.m. show presented by Rams Head On Stage are $75 to $90 and available via ramsheadonstage.com.
If you miss the boat for Arlo Guthrie all is not lost. Check out Valerie June at the Rams Head On Stage performing Sunday night as well.
June was born and raised in Tennessee and migrated to Memphis to begin performing when she was 19.
She combines blues, gospel and Appalachian folk in a style she calls "organic moonshine roots music" and plays guitar, banjo, lap-steel guitar.
After releasing three self-produced albums and moving to Brooklyn in 2011 she was introduced to Dan Auerbach of the Black Keys, who produced and co-wrote several songs on her 2013 breakout album "Pushin' Against a Stone." The record included performance by Booker T. Jones.
The New York Times called June one of the "most intriguing, fully formed new talents" in it's review.
The record and June, marked especially by her unique voice, were well received in the United Kingdom and Europe, and her songs "Workin' Woman Blues" and "You Can't Be Told" were moderate hits.
In 2014 she was nominated for a Blues Music Award as best new artist for "Pushin' Against a Stone."
Now she's out working behind her newest release "The Order of Time." The music varies from soul shouting to blues and African folk and her overall sound reflects the disparate influences in all. Despite the music's varied nature, the songs all belong to a cohesive family - a larger rumination on the passage of time and how it affects us.
Tickets for the 8 p.m. show are $39.50 at ramsheadonstage.com.
On Valentine's Day velvety voiced Sue Matthews and pianist Stef Scaggiari are joined by guitarist Steve Abshire for a special Valentine's evening.
Sue Matthews has a smooth voice and impressive range, both on the musical register and in her songbook, from cabaret to jazz and the classics.
Stefan Scaggiari is an experienced artist with dazzling versatility - at home with Ellington, Gershwin, Mozart, Rachmaninoff, and of course as a jazz improviser.
Abshire played guitar in U.S. Navy bands for 24 years including 18 years with the Commodores, the Navy's jazz ensemble. Since retiring in 1997 he has played all over including sessions with the "Great Guitars" most recently with Bucky Pizzarelli and Frank Vignola.
The show is from 6:30 p.m. to 10:30 p.m. Tickets are $25 go to 49westcoffehouse.com for info or call 410-626-9796 for reservations.

The Associated Press
NEW YORK - A judge confirmed in a court filing Thursday that federal prosecutors in New York are still investigating campaign finance crimes committed when President Donald Trump's former lawyer, Michael Cohen, paid two women to stay silent about alleged affairs with Trump.
U.S. District Judge William H. Pauley III made the disclosure as he agreed to release in several weeks some court documents related to the search warrant that authorized last April's FBI raids on Cohen's home and office. Media organizations had requested access to the records.
Pauley said some documents should stay secret because making them public could jeopardize aspects of its investigation, "including those pertaining to or arising from Cohen's campaign finance crimes."
In December, Pauley sentenced Cohen to three years in prison for crimes including tax evasion, fraud, lying to congress and campaign finance violations that occurred when two women were paid to stay silent about affairs they claimed to have had with Trump.
The judge authorized disclosure of portions of materials related to Cohen's tax evasion and false statements to financial institutions charges, along with Cohen's conduct that did not result in criminal charges.
Nine media organizations had cited high public interest and a right to access in requesting the records.
The judge gave prosecutors until the end of the month to identify portions of the documents that should stay secret.
Prosecutors through a spokesman declined comment.
In his decision, Pauley made revelations about the search warrants as he explained his reasoning on why only some search warrant materials can be released and only with redactions.
The judge said prosecutors had opposed the media requests, saying disclosure "would jeopardize an ongoing investigation and prejudice the privacy rights of uncharged third parties." He said they provided the search warrant materials for the judge to privately review.
He said the search warrant applications and affidavits supporting them "catalogue an assortment of uncharged individuals and detail their involvement in communications and transactions connected to the campaign finance charges to which Cohen pled guilty."
Pauley said prosecutors revealed to him that "these individuals include those cooperating with the Government, those who have provided information to the Government, and other subjects of the investigation."
He said the search warrants do not detail the government's ongoing investigation as much as other documents including affidavits, but they "enumerate topics of inquiry relating to the campaign finance charges."
The judge added: "At this stage, wholesale disclosure of the materials would reveal the scope and direction of the Government's ongoing investigation. It would also unveil subjects of the investigation and the potential conduct under scrutiny, the full volume and nature of the evidence gathered thus far, and the sources of information provided to the Government."
Cohen pleaded in August to two campaign violations and other crimes.
One charge described a $150,000 payment to former Playboy Playmate Karen McDougal and another concerned a $130,000 payment Cohen made to porn star Stormy Daniels using a sham home equity loan before he was reimbursed through the Trump Organization using false invoices, court papers said.
Cohen, in his plea, said that it was all done with the knowledge and at the direction of a "candidate for federal office" - meaning Trump. But whether Trump or anyone else involved with those transactions broke the law remains an open question.
News organizations in the legal action to unseal the documents included The New York Times, The Associated Press, and the parent companies of ABC and CBS News, CNN, the Daily News, The Wall Street Journal, Newsday and the New York Post.
David E. McCraw, vice president and deputy general counsel for The New York Times, said: "We are pleased that the court has rejected the Government's position that the public has no right to see these important and newsworthy materials. While we don't know how extensive the court-approved redactions will be, we are confident that the release of materials will shed light on the investigations involving Mr. Cohen."
In a statement, The Wall Street Journal said Pauley's ruling was "particularly gratifying for The Wall Street Journal, considering our exclusive efforts dating to before the 2016 presidential election at revealing the hush payments that were the basis of Mr. Cohen's campaign-finance guilty plea."
Pauley called the public's right to access the materials substantial and said the materials are "entitled to a strong presumption of public access."
Prosecutor: Manafort meeting with Russian at heart of probe
WASHINGTON - An August 2016 meeting between President Donald Trump's former campaign chairman and an associate with ties to Russian intelligence goes to the "heart" of the Russia investigation, according to a court transcript unsealed Thursday.
The transcript from a sealed hearing in Paul Manafort's case provides further insight into what special counsel Robert Mueller considers significant in his wide-ranging probe of the Kremlin's efforts to sway the 2016 presidential election and the ties between Trump associates and Russia. It makes clear that prosecutors have honed in on the repeated contacts between Manafort and his longtime associate, Konstantin Kilimnik, who the FBI says has ties to the Russian military intelligence agency.
It's unclear what specifically has piqued prosecutors' interests and whether it has any direct connection to any conspiracy related to election interference.

Texto completo: BY JAVIER CORDOBA
The Associated Press
SAN JOSE, Costa Rica - Two more women have accused former Costa Rican President Oscar Arias, a Nobel peace laureate, of sexual misconduct after a criminal complaint alleging sexual assault against another woman was filed against him this week in the Central American nation.
Eleonora Antillon, a well-known Costa Rican journalist and TV presenter, told The Associated Press on Wednesday that Arias assaulted her in the mid-1980s when she was working for his fledgling presidential bid.
In a separate interview, Emma Daly, communications director for Human Rights Watch, said Arias groped her in a hotel lobby in Nicaragua in 1990 when she was working as a young journalist based in Costa Rica.
The New York Times also reported that a fourth woman, a 53-year-old book editor, alleged that Arias unexpectedly put his hand on her leg during a meeting in 2012.
Arias was twice elected president of Costa Rica and in 1987 was honored with the Nobel Peace Prize for his work bringing an end to Central America's protracted civil wars.
The criminal complaint filed Monday in Costa Rica charged that Arias fondled a woman's breasts, kissed her and penetrated her with his fingers in December 2014 at his home in the capital, San Jose. The woman, a nuclear disarmament activist whose name was not released, had gone there for a meeting related to her cause.
In a brief statement Tuesday, Arias denied the allegation. He said he never violated the will of any woman and fought for gender equality during his career.
Antillon, a renowned journalist and TV presenter known as "Nono," decided to break three decades of silence after the complaint became known this week.
Antillon said that in the 1980s, when she was 25 and working for a local TV station, she learned that Arias was interested in having her work for him as he made a preliminary run toward the 1986 presidential election.
She said she expressed disinterest in politics, but Arias insisted and didn't blink when she asked for a salary three times the going rate to try to discourage him.
After an agreement was struck, she said, Arias summoned her to a restaurant in San Jose where he met her in a private room. Almost immediately he put his hand on her thigh and tried to kiss her neck, she said. Antillon said she pushed him away and asked what he thought he was doing.
"'It's just to gain trust,' he told me, laughing," she said.
Four days later she was with Arias and another adviser, but he sent the adviser away.
"He stood up, he was at his desk, he came over staring hard at me, and he grabbed my hand and put it on his penis, over his pants," Antillon said. "I said to him, 'What are you doing?' and he said, 'What do you think we're doing? Look how hard I am.'"
Antillon said she recoiled, knocking over a chair, and Arias grabbed her shoulders, pushed her into an open closet and again placed her hand on his genitals. She pulled it away. Someone made a noise at the door, he composed himself and she left.
Afterward, Antillon said, she never allowed herself to be alone with Arias, whom she described as someone with "serious problems with arrogance."
"He sees himself as the master of the world, that everyone has to submit to him," Antillon said. "He sees himself as a conqueror."
Since then, Antillon said, she felt physically ill whenever she heard about Arias' Nobel prize. She said the experience left a mark and she has tried to dress in a less "feminine" way, not wanting to show much skin.
Only this week was she emboldened to come forward amid news of the complaint, she said.
"I believe her based on what I lived through," Antillon said of the woman whose complaint was filed this week.
Although it's been more than 30 years since the incidents she described to AP, Antillon said if any lawyer could find a way to bring a complaint against Arias, she would be willing to do so.
AP normally does not use the names of alleged victims of sexual assault, but both Antillon and Daly came forward to tell their stories publicly.
Speaking to AP in New York, Daly said she had been in Costa Rica for a couple of years when her encounter with Arias happened in February or April of 1990 in neighboring Nicaragua. At the time she was in her mid-20s, working for an English-language weekly in Costa Rica and stringing for Reuters.
The lobby of the Intercontinental Hotel was packed with journalists and diplomats when she saw Arias, with whom she had established a cordial relationship in her role as a political reporter, Daly said. They had first met years earlier through her parents, who were diplomats, she said. She called out to him and asked a question.
"And instead of answering my question, he stopped and looked at me and leaned forward, and he put his hand on my chest and sort of pulled it down between my breasts and then said, 'You're not wearing a bra' - or words to that effect," Daly told AP.
"I was so shocked, all I could think of to say was, 'Yes I am wearing a bra,' which is a ridiculous reaction but that's what I did in the moment, and he walked on," she continued. "A woman next to me, another reporter, said to me: 'I saw what happened. I'll support you if you want to do something.' And I said, 'No, that's fine, forget about it.'"
Daly said part of what was upsetting was that it came in a professional setting, surrounded by politicians and journalists.
"You're completely ignored from a professional side, but someone touches you and you're made to feel as if you're nothing, they can do whatever they want," she said.
Daly said Arias had never done anything like this in any prior interaction with her, nor had she seen him do anything to anyone else. She felt the overall environment was one of machismo, and if she complained nothing would happen.
She said she felt angry and then humiliated that she "hadn't responded properly, but I didn't really see what I could do or where that could lead. If I had gone to complain about it, I felt I would have been laughed out of whatever office I tried to complain to."
Daly said she told her then-boyfriend as well as several other people about the incident. She doesn't remember seeing Arias again. He left office not long after, and she left the region.
But she said she began thinking about the incident more amid the rise of #MeToo, making an oblique reference to "Even a president and Nobel laureate" in a comment on a friend's Facebook post in October 2017. She said she thought about naming Arias at the time but decided not to.
Daly first told her story publicly to a Washington Post reporter who reached out to her Tuesday.
She said she felt she was in a privileged place - she wasn't going to lose her job, her family support - so it was important to speak out.
She said the difficult thing is that Arias has done good work in his professional life, with the peace plan, but that doesn't give him a pass to mistreat people.
"It would be really wonderful if this spurred some kind of a reckoning in Latin America with men who harass women," Daly said, "particularly at work ... some kind of moment where they understood that there's a need for systemic change and it's really not OK to just touch women because you feel like it."
Arias' National Liberation Party announced in a statement Thursday that he was leaving the party pending an outcome of the criminal case.
On social media, users have been posting messages of support for the women using the hashtag "yotecreo," which means "I believe you."

Texto completo: Bill Cosby has been moved to "general population" at his state prison in Pennsylvania and is being treated the same as all inmates, a prison official told the Daily News Thursday.
The move was made Jan. 28 after Cosby (photo) spent his first few months in "administrative segregation" at the maximum-security SCI Phoenix facility outside Philadelphia, Amy Worden, a spokeswoman for the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections, said.
Cosby spokesman Andrew Wyatt disputed the claims to The News following a story in the New York Times, which first reported the move.
"I spent time with Mr. Cosby. ... He made it clear he's not in general population."
"It's not a matter of debate," Worden told The News. "He misunderstands what general population is. You're either in it or not."

Is Medium cool again? Bezos shows it as a blog platform of choice to reveal and respond

Resumen: Amazon CEO could have given interview to Washington Post, which he owns, or done TV, but instead chose a blogging platform that's not household name.

Texto completo: When Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos decided to publicly accuse lawyers from the parent company of the National Enquirer of blackmail and extortion, his outlet of choice wasn't The Washington Post, which he owns, but instead the Medium blog website.
The world's richest man could have easily posted his claims as a Post op-ed or done a high-profile TV interview.
Instead, he turned to Medium, which has become the go-to website for people who want to get something off their chest. Bezos isn't the first to use it: High-profile names like Tesla founder Elon Musk, former congressman Beto O'Rourke, LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman and actor Wil Wheaton have also posted there.
"It's a logical place to publish," noted CNN media critic Brian Stelter in his media newsletter. "A neutral space where the emphasis is on the words, nothing else – and kept the message away from any Amazon or Post-owned website. "
What Bezos wrote: Jeff Bezos accuses National Enquirer parent of 'extortion and blackmail' attempt
Posting to Medium is easy, which is why so many CEOs, tech journalists, venture capitalists and authors like it. You register, create a handle, open a blank document and add photos and videos to your words and hit publish. This lets you blog, without the bother of having to create your own personal blog that's constantly in need of updating.
The National Enquirer previously shared details of Bezos and his relationship with Lauren Sanchez, a former Los Angeles TV anchor, including romantic text messages the two had sent each other. Bezos and wife MacKenzie announced last month that they would be divorcing after 25 years of marriage, just ahead of The Enquirer posting the intimate exchanges with Sanchez.
The leak of the texts, which Bezos confirmed in his post, prompted the Amazon founder to have Gavin de Becker from his security team investigate how the Enquirer got its hands on the messages.

Bezos claims that AMI CEO David Pecker was "apoplectic” over a separate investigation The Washington Post was doing into Pecker and AMI's interest in expanding to Saudi Arabia, including AMI's publication of a pro-Saudi Arabia tabloid last year ahead of the arrival of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.
Bezos also noted how Pecker "recently entered into an immunity deal with the Department of Justice related to their role in the so-called 'Catch and Kill' process on behalf of President Trump and his election campaign," linking to a New York Times report that said Trump invited Pecker to a White House dinner in which the AMI CEO brought a guest that the Times describes as having "important ties to the royals in Saudi Arabia. "
AMI's response: National Enquirer owner says it 'acted lawfully' in its reporting
Bezos and his investigators accuse the Enquirer of a politically charged reporting job on behalf of President Donald Trump, who Bezos says believes him to be an "enemy," due to his ownership of the Washington Post.
In the post on Medium, Bezos referred to potentially embarrassing photos of him the Enquirer said it had of him in various states of undress.
The most popular post of 2018 was by James Bridle, who described himself in the post as "a writer and artist concerned with technology and culture. " In penning his piece about his concern of seeing sexually themed videos targeting children on YouTube, he said, "I usually write on my own blog, but frankly I don’t want what I’m talking about here anywhere near my own site"
The post got nearly 200,000 views, and many media organizations, including USA TODAY, jumped on points raised in the piece. YouTube was forced a few months later to announce changes to its policies, saying children's content on the YouTube Kids app would be curated and not left for automatic postings.
Jackson Cunningham, who makes cat furniture in Vancouver, Canada, wrote about getting banned for life from Airbnb for writing a bad review of his host on Google, while short story writer David Hopkins went for the less controversial take on the 1990s TV show "Friends," and how it "triggered the downfall of Western Civilization. "
Lance Ulanoff, a tech blogger who posts regularly on Medium, says he was "blown away," by Bezos' decision to make his announcement on Medium.
"It takes guts to print what they planned to release on him," he says. "I mean, there will be ramifications for a CEO of one of the world's biggest and most important companies acting so irresponsibly, but I do love how he pulled the rug out from under the (alleged) extortionists, assuming this is all true.

Texto completo: Amazon founder Jeff Bezos is firing back at National Enquirer owner American Media Inc. (AMI) over what he is calling an "extortion and blackmail" attempt by the tabloid.
In a lengthy post on Medium Thursday, Bezos, who also owns The Washington Post and is also the world's richest person, details alleged correspondence between the lawyer for his lead investigator, Martin Singer, and Dylan Howard, the chief content officer for AMI.
In emails posted by Bezos, Howard says the Enquirer would post a series of images it has of Bezos and former Los Angeles news anchor Lauren Sanchez, the Amazon founder's love interest.
In a separate email, AMI attorney Jon Fine said that the company would not publish the unreleased emails and text if Bezos released a statement "affirming that they have no knowledge or basis for suggesting that AM’s coverage was politically motivated or influenced by political forces. " The emails also demanded Bezos and his investigator agree that they would stop "referring to such a possibility. "
The images, according to Howard's email posted by Bezos, include a variety of private pictures of both Bezos and Sanchez such as a "below the belt selfie" of Bezos and a picture of Sanchez "smoking a cigar in what appears to be a simulated oral sex scene. "
Bezos shared the Medium post from his official Twitter account. Amazon has separately confirmed the authenticity of the post, but declined to comment further. AMI and Howard did not immediately respond to USA TODAY requests for comment.
The National Enquirer previously shared details of Bezos and Sanchez's relationship, including romantic text messages the two had sent one another. The Enquirer posted the text after Bezos' announced last month that he and his wife, MacKenzie, would be getting a divorce after 25 years of marriage.
The leak of the texts, which Bezos confirmed in his post, prompted the Amazon founder to have Gavin de Becker from his security team investigate how the Enquirer got its hands on the messages.
Bezos claims that AMI CEO David Pecker was "apoplectic” over an investigation The Washington Post was doing into Pecker and AMI's interest in expanding to Saudi Arabia, including AMI's publication of a pro-Saudi Arabia tabloid last year ahead of the arrival of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.
"A few days after hearing about Mr. Pecker’s apoplexy, we were approached, verbally at first, with an offer," Bezos writes. "They said they had more of my text messages and photos that they would publish if we didn’t stop our investigation. "
Bezos also notes in his blog how Pecker "recently entered into an immunity deal with the Department of Justice related to their role in the so-called “Catch and Kill” process on behalf of President Trump and his election campaign," linking to a New York Times report that said Trump invited Pecker to a White House dinner in which the AMI CEO brought a guest that the Times describes as having "important ties to the royals in Saudi Arabia. "
In his note to Bezos attorney Singer, Fine requested that the Bezos statement would be made through a "mutually-agreeable news outlet. "
In his Medium posting, Bezos said his ownership of The Washington Post has been a "complexifier" for him before continuing to say that he does not regret his 2013 purchase of the company for $250 million.
"My stewardship of The Post and my support of its mission, which will remain unswerving, is something I will be most proud of when I’m 90 and reviewing my life, if I’m lucky enough to live that long," he writes, "regardless of any complexities it creates for me. "
Given his position, Bezos says he felt he was in a place to stand up the Enquirer. "I was made an offer I couldn’t refuse. Or at least that’s what the top people at the National Enquirer thought," he writes.
"I’m glad they thought that, because it emboldened them to put it all in writing. Rather than capitulate to extortion and blackmail, I’ve decided to publish exactly what they sent me, despite the personal cost and embarrassment they threaten. "
The Pecker-Trump relationship
Pecker is a longtime ally of President Donald Trump. Trump has been a critic of Bezos, Amazon and The Post frequently targeting all three on Twitter.
Trump tweeted about Bezos' personal life following the National Enquirer's reveal that Bezos was seeing Sanchez, calling the Amazon founder "Jeff Bozo" and writing that he was "so sorry to hear the news" about Bezos being "taken down by a competitor whose reporting, I understand, is far more accurate than the reporting in his lobbyist newspaper, the Amazon Washington Post. "
Federal prosecutors in New York have accused AMI of participating in a scheme to help him win the presidency by paying women to keep silent about alleged extramarital affairs before the election. More than a year before the election, Pecker met with Trump’s former lawyer Michael Cohen and an unnamed member of his campaign to discuss ways the company could help bottle up damaging stories about Trump.
In August 2016, AMI struck a deal with former Playboy playmate Karen McDougal to pay her $150,000 for the rights to publish her claim to have carried on an affair with Trump a decade earlier. Prosecutors said the company’s “principal purpose in entering into the agreement was to suppress (her) story so as to prevent it from influencing the election. ”
Cohen pleaded guilty last year to orchestrating that payment and another, to the pornographic actress Stormy Daniels, both of which violated federal campaign finance laws. Soon after, prosecutors promised not to bring charges against AMI in exchange for its cooperation with their investigation, one of two criminal probes now encircling the president. U. S. District Judge William Pauley said in a decision on Thursday that the probe of the campaign finance violations is ongoing.

Texto completo: Editor's Note: This column was originally published on Feb. 10, 2017. Former Rep. John Dingell died on Feb. 7, 2019, at age 92.
Since 1966, the news media have granted the opposition party a national platform to deliver a response to the president’s annual State of the Union Address. This attempt to balance our debate must be upgraded for the 21st century, now that we have a new president who tweets like a moody teenager who was just denied a participation award. Democrats should name a Twitter account to issue official responses to President Trump’s tweets, and those rebuttals should be noted in any relevant reporting.
There’s one tweeter who has best demonstrated the character and the 140 characters necessary to perform this role. The best way to stop an unstable 70-year-old with an itchy Twitter finger is the world’s greatest 90-year-old Twitter user — @JohnDingell, a former Democratic representative of Michigan.
While still serving in Congress as a spry 88-year-old in 2014, Dingell was recognized by BuzzFeed as “probably the best person on Twitter” after an errant tweet from an Environmental Protection Agency account led him to tweeting about the shock of learning what a “Kardashian” is. Since then, he has retired from the House as the longest serving member of Congress in U. S. history and gone on to successfully defend his title of “tweet king” — as Politico Playbook recently called him — with reliable barbs focused on politics, Michigan sports and Donald Trump.
“Forget the basket,” Dingell tweeted during Trump’s transition. “The truly deplorable ones end up in the Cabinet. ”
When The New York Times reported that Trump aides couldn't operate the light switches at the White House, Dingell tweeted, "Luckly for them, setting the Constitution on fire provides at least a bit of working light. " As for the fake-news inaugural furor, Dingell tweeted: “If you think lying about a crowd size is bad, wait until you hear about their plan to kick 30,000,000 people off their health care coverage. ”
America might have faced periods of greater discord, strife and division, but our public debate has never been so abrasive, typo-ridden and pissy. And much, if not most, of the thanks for our degenerating discourse belongs to the more than 34,000 tweets of the new president of the United States.
A recent Quinnipiac University poll found that 64% of Americans — including 45% of Republicans — believe that Trump should give up his personal Twitter account. But given the president’s unwillingness to release his taxes, divest from his businesses or even read a Dummies guide to the Constitution, Democrats can’t wait around and expect Trump to moderate his behavior on his own.
You could argue that the left would be better served if its official digital response came from a somewhat younger voice from one of the communities most likely to bear the brunt of Trump’s attacks on reproductive health care, immigrants and voting rights. But institutions are all that Americans can rely on now to protect us from Trump’s sleep-starved, anti-democratic impulses.
And John Dingell is an institution.
On the day Pearl Harbor was bombed, he was working as a page on the floor of the House of Representatives. First elected in 1955, he presided over the House in 1965 when Medicare passed and was there in 2010 when President Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into law. Dingell was one of the last two World War II veterans left in Congress when he retired after his 30th term in 2014.
Most important, Dingell doesn’t ever have to worry about ever getting a job again. This gives him a freedom to swing back at Trump’s wild accusations, proclamations and ejaculations.
Plus, he — like the president — seems to have a fair amount of spare time.
I visited Dingell’s home in Dearborn and found him still filled of reverence for the presidential office that he says “our Founding Fathers and members of Congress regarded as almost mystical in its qualities. ” But that reverence is not extended to the man who now holds it, whom he finds to be “a bully and a blowhard and a liar. "
Dingell doesn’t want Trump to fail because “if he’s not a success, everything goes to hell. I want to see him succeed in a proper way. ”
What would a proper success look like?
“He is the president of all Americans. It is his duty to look to the well-being of all parts of the county. We’ve not yet seen whether he is doing that, whether he intends to do that or whether he will do that. ”
In fact, Dingell’s seeing the opposite.
“Whether you’re talking about Roosevelt, Hoover or Trump, they have a responsibility to preserve the dignity of the office. I don’t see him doing that so far. ”
His advice to the new tweeter in chief?
“Be careful. He has a responsibility for the economy, the jobs, the futures, the hopes, the dreams of 330 million Americans. ”
As a man born between the two world wars and a student of history, Dingell has a staggering sense of the perils of Trump’s bombast.
“If you look, a bunch of big-mouthed European potentates got us into World War I. Do you remember what happened in August of 1914? Read that history. It’s terrifying. ”
Many on the right have attempted to reframe Trump’s Twitter usage as a modern update of Franklin Roosevelt’s fireside chats that soothed a nation transitioning from the worst Depression in American economic history to the deadliest war ever. Dingell’s not buying it.
“I listened to the fireside chats as a boy, and they were received reverentially by the American people. You can’t say his tweets are received reverentially. You can’t say mine are, either. You sure as hell shouldn’t,” Dingell said, displaying a self-awareness that is now not allowed within several hundred feet of the White House.
POLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media
Are there any checks and balances on the Twitter use of a former U. S. congressman?
“John Dingell unfiltered is a little dangerous,” Rep. Debbie Dingell, 63, who succeeded her husband and must still run for re-election, told me. “We encourage him to run (his thoughts) by us before they get posted. ”
“And I usually do,” Mr. Dingell assured me.
He recognizes that Twitter offers everyone “a chance to make an ass of himself publicly. ” He compares putting that power in the undersized hands of the president to giving “a gun to a kid” without any safety training. But his worries extend far beyond Trump’s Twitter use.
“He is a man who has two problems that work against each other. One is ego. He has a gigantic ego. And he has a gigantic inferiority complex," Dingell told me. “And he’s playing into the hands of his enemies. But he’s also playing into the hands of our enemies in the nation, which is why people in that kind of office are so careful about what they say. And he’s not. And all of these things are going to come back. ”
Seven decades in public service have left Dingell with some optimism that even Trump could rise to the stature of his office.
“He still has time. And you should watch this to see that he doesn’t jeopardize our leadership position in the world. ”
But that hope is only discouraged by the new president’s conduct.
After Trump fired his acting attorney general for refusing to defend his immigration ban, Dingell tweeted, “Comparisons to President Nixon's Saturday Night Massacre are a bit misguided, in that Nixon at least had a general idea of what the hell he was doing. ”
That’s the kind of context every American needs.

Texto completo: Ariana Grande is speaking out after a Grammys producer said the singer wasn't performing at the Sunday night show because she "felt it was too late for her to pull something together. "
After Grammys producer Ken Ehrlich told The Associated Press that Grande said it was too late for her to adequately prepare, Grande refuted that claim on social media.
After sharing a screenshot of an article including Ehrlich's comments, Grande wrote on Twitter: "i’ve kept my mouth shut but now you’re lying about me. i can pull together a performance over night and you know that, Ken. it was when my creativity & self expression was stifled by you, that i decided not to attend. i hope the show is exactly what you want it to be and more. "
She continued: "i offered 3 different songs. it’s about collaboration. it’s about feeling supported. it’s about art and honesty. not politics. not doing favors or playing games. it’s just a game y’all. . and i’m sorry but that’s not what music is to me. "

The 2019 Grammys will broadcast live from Los Angeles' Staples Center Sunday on CBS at 8 EST/5 PST. Ehrlich told the New York Times that Drake, Kendrick Lamar and Childish Gambino all declined offers to perform in the show.
In Ehrlich's AP chat, he said the show had multiple conversations with Grande about the possibility of appearing. He said the Recording Academy wanted her to perform after having "conversations over the past month or so" and by the time it seemed like a performance might work out, Grande said it was too late to prepare.
Who won't be there: Will these stars skip the 2019 Grammys? Why Beyonce, Taylor Swift and Drake may not show
Variety reported this week that the singer had a disagreement with Grammy producers on which songs she would perform, so she pulled out.
Grande is nominated for two awards and said she's "still grateful for the acknowledgement this year," though she didn't receive the number of Grammy nominations many fans hoped, with her "Sweetener" album snubbed in the night's biggest categories.
The last time Grande attended the Grammys was in 2016, skipping the 2017 awards despite receiving two nominations. She wasn't nominated for any awards in 2018.

Grande does have an album dropping Grammys weekend, with "Thank U, Next" arriving Friday.
Grande has been featured on billboards promoting Sunday's show, and the irony wasn't lost on the singer as she was ranting on Twitter about her decision not to perform being miscast – noting that she passed a bus sporting a Grammys ad with her face as she was typing.
The pop star's mother, Joan Grande, also chimed in on Twitter.
"I agree with you Ariana," she said, and called the Grammys ad campaign "exploitive" for featuring her daughter's face even though she was never a confirmed performer.

Texto completo: Far from a witch hunt or partisan political attack, Democratic congressional efforts to obtain President Donald Trump’s tax returns are a necessary exercise of legislative oversight responsibility. The president’s returns, and those of his 500 businesses, could answer essential questions about his fitness for office, and serve as an invaluable guide to what needs fixing in our tax code. Congress has a duty to pursue both investigations, and do so promptly.
On Thursday, the House Ways and Means Oversight Subcommittee will hold a hearing on a proposal to require presidents and presidential candidates to release their tax returns. But Congress already has the duty and the right to obtain Trump’s tax returns. Under a 1924 law enacted in the wake of another administration marked by legal challenges and potential conflicts of interest, the chair of each of three tax-focused committees has the authority to obtain the tax returns of any U. S. citizen, including the president.
Read more commentary:
Is Trump smart on taxes, or a clever tax con man who committed 'outright fraud'?
Trump should revive the wealth tax he called for in 1999. We need it more than ever.
Ocasio-Cortez is right: Rich must pay more to help close US wealth and income gaps
This power has for good reason been exercised sparingly. It helped Congress unravel the Watergate scandal of the 1970s and was used as recently as 2014 by Republican lawmakers.
Congress should act with urgency because it’s likely Trump will resist its efforts. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who would ultimately decide on whether to honor a request for Trump’s taxes, has been noncommittal, saying only that he “will review any request with the Treasury general counsel for legality. ” That could set up a legal challenge that might last months if not years, perhaps even past the 2020 election.
But voters deserve answers now, well before the next presidential election. Here’s why.
The law is broken and now it benefits Trump
First, a review of Trump’s taxes would highlight defects in our tax laws, as explained in a recent report from our organization. As a billionaire who has apparently paid zero federal income taxes in multiple years, Trump could serve as an illustrative example of how the wealthy are able to avoid paying their fair share and help spur urgently needed reform.
Second, we need to know whether and how much Trump personally gains from the tax policies he promotes and signs into law. We estimate that he and his family could save as much as $22 million from the Trump-GOP tax cuts enacted in 2017. Citizens have a right to know whether their leaders are pursuing policies for their private benefit instead of the public interest.
Another important issue is whether Trump has violated federal law by illegally evading taxes or has shown a disregard for his obligation to pay his fair share by engaging in flagrant tax dodging. Last year, The New York Times published an exhaustive report on “dubious” tax avoidance strategies pursued by Trump’s family over the past half-century, including what the newspaper declared to be “instances of outright fraud. ”
The next pressing question is whether Trump’s global business interests have compromised the exercise of his official duties, especially the conduct of foreign policy.
Trump tax returns would reveal foreign ties
Contrary to past practice, Trump failed to transfer his assets into a blind trust upon assuming office. Therefore, he has a good idea of how government policies will impact his personal finances. Among the problematic nations he has done business with are Russia and Saudi Arabia.
Trump’s tax returns would likely reveal just how deeply involved he is in Russia and with oligarchs close to President Vladimir Putin. Charting Trump’s Russian connections might shed light on Trump’s inexplicable deference to Putin.
Trump’s pursuit of a luxury Moscow hotel deal through much of 2016 has been in the news lately as part of special prosecutor Robert Mueller’s investigation. But Trump has sought and secured business deals and investments in Russia and with prominent Russians for some time, including all-cash real estate deals that shady businessmen use to hide and launder ill-gotten gains.
Saudi nationals and their agents have similarly been frequent buyers of Trump assets and reliable customers of his businesses, both before and since he became president. That includes spending a quarter million dollars last year at his hotel in Washington, steps from the White House, to pay the expenses of lobbyists favoring a Saudi-government position. Trump has in turn been reluctant to criticize the Saudi kingdom.
Seeking out information to guide policy reform and keeping an eye on the executive branch are central roles of Congress and its committees. Under new leadership, the House Ways and Means Committee should act promptly to obtain Trump’s tax returns in order to better identify flaws in our tax system and to judge serious legal and ethical questions confronting our president.

Times Reports $709 Million In Digital Revenue for 2018

Texto completo: The New York Times Company generated more than $709 million in digital revenue last year, growing at a pace that suggests it will meet its stated goal of $800 million in digital sales by the end of 2020.
The results prompted the company to set another lofty target: "To grow our subscription business to more than 10 million subscriptions by 2025," Mark Thompson, the chief executive, said in a statement announcing the company's fourth-quarter financial results.
More than 3.3 million people pay for the company's digital products, including its news, crossword and food apps, a 27 percent jump from 2017. The total number of paid subscriptions for digital and print reached 4.3 million, a high.
Online subscription revenue gained nearly 18 percent to reach $400 million in 2018, while digital advertising rose 8.6 percent, to $259 million. In the last three months of the year, digital subscription sales grew at a slower pace, about 9 percent, to $105 million. That slowdown was partly the result of an extra week in the fourth quarter of 2017 and partly the result of marketing efforts such as introductory discounts for online access. Those offers attract new readers who bring in less revenue -- but the company expects many of them to become full subscribers over time.
The Times added 265,000 new digital subscribers in the fourth quarter, the biggest jump since the so-called Trump bump after the 2016 election. About 172,000 of those subscribers signed on for the core news product, while the rest were drawn by digital-only products like Crossword and Cooking.
The company hit another revenue milestone: Digital advertising surpassed print advertising for the first time in the fourth quarter, jumping 23 percent to $103 million. Print advertising fell 10 percent, to $88 million.
The revenue gains will allow the company to spend more on its newsroom operations.
"Our appeal to subscribers -- and to the world's leading advertisers -- depends more than anything on the quality of our journalism," Mr. Thompson said in the statement. "That is why we have increased, rather than cut back, our investment in our newsroom and opinion departments. We want to accelerate our digital growth further, so in 2019, we will direct fresh investment into journalism, product and marketing."
Last year the company added 120 newsroom employees, bringing the total number of journalists at The Times to 1,600, the largest count in its history.
The company reported the positive financial results at a time when newspapers nationwide have experienced a hollowing out. Gannett has laid off reporters across the country and recently fended off a hostile takeover bid. McClatchy offered buyouts to 10 percent of its staff, about 450 employees.
Digital news organizations have also struggled lately. Last month BuzzFeed laid off 15 percent of its work force, roughly 220 employees; Verizon Media Group announced a 7 percent cut in its media divisions, which equals about 800 positions; and a 10 percent cut is underway at Vice Media.
At The Times, the total revenue in the fourth quarter was $503 million, a nearly 4 percent increase from a year earlier. Operating profit decreased by 17.5 percent, to $75 million. (The drop was due partly to the extra week in the fourth quarter of 2017.)
The company also announced on Wednesday that it would increase the dividend it pays shareholders by 25 percent. Investors who own Times Company stock will receive 5 cents per share every quarter, costing the company about $33 million a year. That will also benefit the Ochs-Sulzberger family that controls The Times. As of last February, the family reported it owned about 9 percent of the equity in the company.
In the earnings conference call on Wednesday, Mr. Thompson said the company had plans to test a price increase for digital subscribers in the early part of the year. This would be the first price increase in seven and a half years, Meredith Kopit Levien, the company's executive vice president and chief operating officer, said.
"We're confident that our digital subscribers will also understand why the price paid for high-quality journalism sometimes has to increase if the journalism itself is to flourish," Mr. Thompson said.
Noting that 16 percent of Times subscribers live outside the United States, Ms. Levien said she sees room for international growth. "We believe there is a very big opportunity for The New York Times to be one of the handful of dominant global news producers," she said.
The company's cash position continues to grow, and it now has $826 million on hand. In addition to the increase in the dividend and added investments in the newsroom, the company said it would exercise its option to buy back the New York Times Building before the end of this year at a cost of $250 million.
The company entered into the sale-leaseback agreement with W. P. Carey & Company, an investment firm, 10 years ago in order to raise $225 million. At the time, the company was looking to pay down its debts, which stood at more than $1 billion, during a severe slump in the newspaper industry.
The earnings news prompted a 10.3 percent rise in the company's stock; it closed at $29.69.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – The daughter of late Sen. John McCain denounced President Donald Trump as "pathetic" on Tuesday after reports surfaced that the president mocked the late senator just hours before his State of the Union address.
Trump reportedly made fun of McCain, a Republican who died in August after battling brain cancer, during an off-the-record lunch with television news anchors.
During the meeting, Trump attacked Democrats and recited the moment when McCain voted against repealing the Affordable Care Act, according to The New York Times.
"By the way, he wrote a book and the book bombed," Trump said of McCain's book, "The Restless Wave," according to the Times.
McCain's daughter, Meghan McCain, called out Trump on Twitter, calling his comments "pathetic. "

"The president’s obsession with my father 6 months after his death is pathetic and telling – even at a time when he should be focusing on his message to the American public and the state of our union – the greatness of my father’s life and legacy haunts you," she wrote on Twitter.
McCain's book soared on the bestseller's list after his death. It was ranked No. 2 on Amazon and No. 3 on Barnes and Noble's website, according to the Los Angeles Times.
The book chronicles his battle with brain cancer and reflects on his time in the military and serving in Congress. McCain was often critical of the president and in the book wrote: "He seems uninterested in the moral character of world leaders and their regimes. The appearance of toughness or a reality show facsimile of toughness seems to matter more than any of our values. Flattery secures his friendship, criticism his enmity. "
Trump did not attend McCain's funeral in Washington. During the proceedings, he posted on Twitter.
"MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!" Trump wrote in one tweet.

Online’s ‘walled gardens’ must stop assuming real news is free

Texto completo: Facebook and Google have been brutal to the news business. But this primarily reflects a failure of imagination. The tech giants are the world’s best distribution platforms and could be an answer for journalism instead of a grave threat.
As readers have shifted to digital sources, the two companies have taken a large majority of online advertising revenue. More important, the platforms now act as "regulators" of the news business — determining what information gets delivered to whom, and when. With the flick of an algorithmic finger, those two companies decide what news you see and whether a publisher lives or dies.
The impact on journalism has been clear. Just within the past week, we have seen over 1,000 planned layoffs at Gannett, BuzzFeed and HuffPost, and no one thinks we are anywhere near the end. Facebook and Google’s answer so far has been to pledge to spend $300 million each over the next three years to help journalism. But that money will be dribbled across a huge news landscape, and much of it will undoubtedly be used to encourage further use of Facebook and Google products.
But such investments amount to charity, and charity will never be the answer. What news publishers really need are active partners who are willing to embrace the idea that quality journalism sustains our civic society and that the answer to bad information is more good information.
We can start with the fact that "free" isn’t a good business model for quality journalism. Facebook and Google flatly refuse to pay for news even though they license many other types of content. Both companies have deals to pay music publishers when copyrighted songs play on their platforms. And the companies also aggressively bid to stream live sports and entertainment content to run on Facebook Watch and YouTube. These deals are varied and often secret, but none of them are based on "free." Why are the platforms so unwilling to pay news publishers for access to the quality journalism that users need and value?
The tech giants are also run as "walled gardens" that minimize brands and separate publishers from their readers — even while hoarding information about those same readers. Imagine trying to build a trusted relationship with an audience when you can’t even know who they are. Publishers need new economic terms that include more revenue and more information about our readers. Any minor costs to these companies would pay huge dividends not only for our society but also for their credibility with Congress and policymakers around the world.
Facebook and Google also need to be willing to acknowledge investments in quality journalism through their algorithms. They are constantly on the defensive about spreading false and misleading "news" that hurts people. They could start to address the problem by simply recognizing that The Miami Herald is a much better news source than Russian bots or Macedonian teenagers — and highlighting original, quality content accordingly.
A study by the University of North Carolina’s School of Media and Journalism found that more than 1,300 American communities have completely lost sources of local news.
David Simon, a former newspaper journalist who became a TV writer, lamented the loss of local coverage and said in an interview with The Guardian: "Oh, to be a state or local official in America over the next 10 to 15 years, before somebody figures out the business model. To gambol freely across the wastelands of an American city, as a local politician! It’s got to be one of the great dreams in the history of American corruption."
Facebook and Google could address these risks by embracing responsibilities and becoming partners, rather than minor benefactors, for journalism. They need to come to the table with a real deal on revenue, data and algorithms.
Facebook and Google talk incessantly about how they are improving the world. Why not do something genuinely good for all of us and support journalism instead of destroying it? And it wouldn’t even have to be that hard. There is plenty of money and quality content to go around. All it would take is a little enlightened self-interest and a real commitment to the continued existence of quality news.
David Chavern is president and CEO of the News Media Alliance, a trade association representing news publishers in the United States and Canada. This is an edited version of a column that first appeared in The New York Times.

Don’t make ‘Medicare for all’ a litmus test

Texto completo: Hear that crunching sound? It’s the eggshells that 2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls are stomping through, backing up and stomping upon all over again, as they attempt to satisfy the base’s delicate demands for Medicare-for-all.
The left-wing die-hards sometimes argue that supporting Medicare-for-all should be a litmus test for anyone seeking the 2020 nomination because it’s not only good policy but good politics, too. The entrenched establishment may claim it’s a "radical" idea, but surveys suggest it is mainstream.
"If I look at polling and 70 percent of the people support Medicare for All, if a very significant percentage of people think the rich, the very rich, should start paying their fair share of taxes," Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont Independent, told The New York Times, "I think I’d be pretty dumb not to develop policies that capture what the American people want."
In a sense, Sanders is right: The phrase "Medicare-for-all" polls favorably (though not always at 70 percent), and has for several years.
Here’s the problem. The things Americans are apparently envisioning when they tell pollsters they support Medicare-for-all turn out to be a different, vaguer and more varied set of ideas than the specific thing that Sanders, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a New York Democrat, and others in the progressive base are proposing. Sanders, et al. want all Americans enrolled in a single, generous, government-run — or single-payer — plan with no private insurers offering their own similar, competing policies.
How does the public feel about this? If you simply ask, "Do you favor or oppose having a national health plan, sometimes called Medicare-for-all?," 56 percent of respondents favor it, according to a January Kaiser Family Foundation poll. But mention that Medicare-for-all involves getting rid of private insurance companies, and support plummets to 37 percent.
Wary of provoking the single-payer-or-bust-ers, some Democratic 2020 candidates have given incoherent or noncommittal remarks on the subject. Democratic Sens. Elizabeth Warren, of Massachussetts, and Kirsten Gillibrand, of New York have both sidestepped the issue. Asked about private insurance, Warren said last week there were a lot of paths to get to "affordable health care for every American."
And you know what? That’s the right answer right now. The thing Americans want most, if you look at the polling, is not single-payer per se. They want universal, affordable coverage that doesn’t leave them begging on GoFundMe for their kids’ insulin. In that same Kaiser survey, support for "Medicare for All" was highest — 71 percent — when respondents were told it would "guarantee health insurance as a right for all Americans." And purity tests aside, there are many ways to achieve that outcome. Rather than insisting that "there’s no viable path to the Democratic nomination for someone who does not support single-payer health care," as one progressive writer put it, Democrats should start with principles and objectives, and figure out the most effective and feasible route to them.
This is the richest country on Earth. Truly, we can figure this out. But not if we let the perfect become the enemy of the good.

Why Trump's 'big, beautiful wall' won't help border security

Texto completo: Nancy Pelosi is wrong. President Trump's proposed border wall isn't "immoral." It's stupid.
Trump provoked the government shutdown by insisting on money for the wall. He keeps hammering on the subject. A West Wing staffer acknowledged to The New York Times that Trump's fixation has created a "one-issue White House." Reality, however, keeps undercutting Trump's argument.
Last week, federal agents stopped a 254-pound shipment of fentanyl from Mexico. It was a record bust. It happened not along a barrier-free section of the border but at the Nogales, Ariz., checkpoint.
Fentanyl, a dangerous synthetic, has been driving the rise in fatal drug overdoses. Smugglers had hidden this load under piles of cucumbers. As authorities have said regularly, most illegal drugs enter from Mexico at legal points of entry. Trump's "wall" wouldn't stop them.
More money might. Border security can and should be better. Yet Trump keeps insisting on trying to spend money the wrong way.
The Department of Homeland Security estimates that it would cost $22 billion to build a barrier on the roughly 1,350-portion of the southern border that doesn't have one. Trump claims that the nation needs the wall yesterday because of an immigration crisis.
Yet lawsuits remain 13 years after President George W. Bush tried to put a wall where landowners didn't want it. The government can't seize property without an eminent domain hearing. Trump would waste time and money when Homeland Security could expand the use of better, cheaper methods such as electronic surveillance.
Trump also is fabricating a crisis on the border with his deployment of 3,750 more active-duty soldiers. Though their role is to help with surveillance and to install razor wire, the deployment - which Trump has extended twice - suggests a national security threat.
In fact, apprehensions on the southern border have been dropping precipitously. During the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, there were roughly 400,000, down from almost 1.75 million in 2000.
Though the trend most recently has been slightly upward, that change is of Trump's making. His administration has ordered the arrest of more family members. Immigration cases have doubled since Trump took office. Democrats have proposed money for more judges, but Trump has refused.
The president is correct that Pelosi once voted for a border barrier. So did Chuck Schumer, now leading the resistance among Senate Democrats to Trump's wall. But there's more to the story.
In 2006, Pelosi and Schumer voted for the Secure Fence Act. It provided $2.3 billion between 2007 and 2015 money for physical barriers. The legislation, though, included many other border security measures.
There have been problems. Customs and Border Protection identified roughly 9,300 breaches in border barriers between 2000 and 2015. Trump's wall, however, amounts to Fire, Ready, Aim.
Last July, the Government Accountability Office analyzed Homeland Security's response to the executive order Trump issued soon after taking office. It called for the agency to "immediately plan, design, and construct a wall or other physical barriers along the southwest border."
According to the GAO, Customs and Border Protection had not studied the cost of the barrier based on location, which can raise the price. For a key segment near San Diego, the agency hadn't finalized its design. The GAO concluded that the plan "lacks key information."
Trump also has claimed that the wall would reduce terrorist threats. His own State Department, however, acknowledges that terrorists aren't seeking to come here through the southern border.
Moreover, right-wing militants commit more domestic terrorism than Islamic extremists. Yet Trump's 2018 budget would have cut funding to deal with such violence by $600 million and shifted that money to the wall.
Trump refers often to the murder of American citizens by illegal immigrants. All those deaths are tragedies. Yet over just four days in January, three American-born men killed 14 people in mass shootings, one at a SunTrust bank in Sebring.
Border security is part of comprehensive immigration reform. The Congressional Budget Office calculated that the 2013 reform bill that passed the Senate with bipartisan support would have reduced the federal budget by almost $200 billion over 10 years. How? By providing a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants.
To Trump, that conclusion would make no sense. He speaks often of a wall. The reality is that he's operating from a bunker.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - C.S. Lewis was only partly right when he wrote: "The greatest evil ... is conceived and ordered (moved, seconded, carried and minuted) in clean, carpeted, warmed and well-lighted offices, by quiet men with white collars and cut fingernails and smooth-shaven cheeks who do not need to raise their voice."
Lewis, perhaps, couldn't have envisioned the day when a law allowing abortion up to the moment of birth would receive a standing ovation, as occurred last month with New York's passage of the absurdly named "Reproductive Health Act."
Upon signing the bill, which also permits some health care professionals who are not doctors to perform the abortions, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo ordered that One World Trade Center be illuminated in pink, hijacking the color associated with saving breast-cancer victims - and the birth of a baby girl.
What a weird, wicked world we live in.
Last Monday in Virginia, Del. Kathy Tran testified on behalf of a bill that would have simplified the process for having a late-term abortion. Currently, Virginia law requires three doctors' approval for such a procedure. The bill, which was subsequently tabled, would've required only one. This was hardly the stuff of "infanticide," a word that began tumbling from the lips of certain critics, but Gov. Ralph Northam wasn't helpful. During a radio interview, he spoke of making distressed newborns "comfortable" while the family decides whether to resuscitate.
Just maybe we're not very good at talking about the unspeakable.
Meanwhile, lawmakers in Rhode Island, Massachusetts, Vermont and other blue states are busy hammering out their own legal concoctions, likely concerned that Roe v. Wade will be overturned by the now-predominantly conservative Supreme Court. I leave others to argue the validity of those concerns, but my sources in the pro-life movement, including several legal scholars, think upending the decision is unlikely given that, in 1992, the court not only reinforced Roe but actually made the ruling stronger.
Regardless, the pro-choice movement has been preparing for such a frontal assault on the few abortion restrictions left to states. In 1973, when Roe was issued, a baby's viability was set at 24-28 weeks. Today, thanks to technology and our finer understanding of human development, viability occurs around 22 weeks.
In New York City, where about 2 in 5 pregnancies are terminated, there will no longer be any presumption of humanity for the baby at any stage of pregnancy, which goes far beyond abortion jurisprudence. Most Americans are fully against such extreme approaches to abortion. One survey puts the share who support abortion during the third trimester at just 13 percent.
Like many if not most Americans, I have been reasonably at ease with President Bill Clinton's 1996 call for making abortion "safe, legal and rare," but had hoped we'd seriously pursue that goal through better information and limit abortion to the first trimester. But the pro-choice side has resisted many attempts to educate. Activists have opposed laws requiring that pregnant women have the option of viewing a sonogram before their abortion. They've also thwarted attempts to make adoption resources available at abortion clinics.
What are they afraid of? That someone may change her mind?
My own thinking about abortion was partly formed by having almost witnessed a "back-alley abortion" when a college friend sought an abortion in 1970 in Spain. We walked into a room with a white linoleum table over which, not kidding, a single light bulb hung. We bolted, called home for money, and put her on a plane to London for a legal abortion.
No one wants women to be subjected to such last resorts. But nor should we be celebrating laws that ignore the humanity of an unborn child. While there are only four doctors in the U.S. who perform third-trimester abortions and, obviously, "no one gets an abortion on the delivery table," as New York Times columnist Michelle Goldberg put it, the codification of late-term abortion should be discomfiting.
It is obvious, meanwhile, that these pro-abortion legislators' new efforts are aimed at undoing, one by one, the state-level "victories" of their pro-life counterparts - even, apparently, if it means putting women's lives at greater risk by allowing non-doctors to perform abortions.
But more concerning than a possible increase in late-term abortions (now at fewer than 2 percent of all pregnancy terminations) is the clinical way we've come to view and discuss human life. When we use language to disguise reality - whether the developing human baby is a "clump of cells," a "fetus" or even a "product of termination" - we move ever-closer to the dehumanization of us all.

Texto completo: Federal prosecutors subpoena Trump’s inaugural committee
NEW YORK (AP) — Federal prosecutors in New York have issued a subpoena seeking documents from Donald Trump’s inaugural committee.
A spokeswoman says the committee intends to cooperate with the inquiry. She said the committee received the subpoena late Monday and was reviewing it.
It was not immediately clear which documents have been requested.
The Wall Street Journal reported last year that federal prosecutors are investigating whether inaugural committee donors made contributions in exchange for political favors. The newspaper said the inquiry also was focused on whether the inauguration misspent money it raised to stage inaugural events.
The New York Times reported recently that federal prosecutors are examining whether anyone from Qatar, Saudi Arabia or other Middle Eastern countries made illegal payments to the committee and a pro-Trump super political action committee.
U.S. prepares to start building portion of Texas border wall
HOUSTON (AP) — The U.S. government is preparing to begin construction of more border walls and fencing in South Texas’ Rio Grande Valley, likely on federally owned land set aside as wildlife refuge property.
Heavy construction equipment was expected to arrive starting Monday, U.S. Customs and Border Protection said. A photo posted by the nonprofit National Butterfly Center shows an excavator parked next to its property.
Congress last March approved more than $600 million for 33 miles of new barriers in the Rio Grande Valley. While President Donald Trump and top Democrats remain in a standoff over Trump’s demand for $5.7 billion in border wall funding, U.S. Customs and Border Protection has pushed ahead with building what’s already funded.
That construction was often described as fencing, and the government funding bill that included construction was supported by some Democrats in the House and Senate. CBP refers to what it plans to build as a “border wall system.”
According to designs it released in September, CBP intends to build 25 miles of concrete walls to the height of the existing flood-control levee in Hidalgo County next to the Rio Grande, the river that forms the U.S.-Mexico border in Texas. On top of the concrete walls, CBP will install 18-foot steel posts and clear a 150-foot enforcement zone in front.
Fate of Mexican drug lord El Chapo now rests with US jury
NEW YORK (AP) — After nearly three months of testimony about a vast drug-smuggling conspiracy steeped in violence, a jury began deliberations on Monday at the U.S. trial of the infamous Mexican drug lord Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman.
The day ended without jurors reaching a verdict for Guzman, who faces life in prison if convicted. They were to resume deliberations Tuesday morning.
The jury has heard months of testimony about Guzman’s rise to power as the head of the Sinaloa cartel. Prosecutors say he is responsible for smuggling at least 200 tons of cocaine into the U.S. and for a wave of killings in turf wars with other cartels.
Guzman, 61, is notorious for escaping from prison twice in Mexico. In closing arguments, prosecutor Andrea Goldbarg said he was plotting yet another breakout when was he was sent in 2017 to the U.S., where he has been in solitary confinement ever since.

Texto completo: The investment firm founded by the chairman of Donald Trump’s inaugural committee, Tom Barrack, developed a plan to profit off its connections to the incoming administration and foreign dignitaries, according to a confidential memo obtained by WNYC and ProPublica.
“The key is to strategically cultivate domestic and international relations while avoiding any appearance of lobbying,” the memo says. Colony, which primarily invests in real estate, sought to capitalize on its access to the White House to get an early lead on infrastructure investments and to attract assets from potential investors.
Federal prosecutors in Manhattan on Monday subpoenaed documents from the nonprofit 58th Presidential Inaugural Committee, including anything related to foreign donations. Such donations to presidential inaugural committees are barred by law. Investigators are probing whether foreigners gave money in exchange for influence with the incoming Trump administration, NBC News reported.
The memo, from Barrack’s investment firm, then called Colony NorthStar, is dated February 2017, just a month after the inaugural festivities organized by Barrack, who is a longtime Trump friend.
The Colony memo shows how the company was positioning itself to take advantage of Barrack’s relationship with Trump and foreign officials immediately after the president was sworn in. Barrack hosted a chairman’s dinner during inaugural week, with his own invite list, which included businesspeople and foreign dignitaries.
“‘Contact’ — ‘Cultivation’ — ‘Conversion’ should be the mantra and objective of Colony NorthStar’s international program in DC and internationally,” the memo said. No other firms “can currently match the relationships or resources that we possess,” it added.
The memo outlines a “strategic plan” for Colony, which now has $44 billion under management, to ramp up its operations in Washington and open an office there. It envisions “setting up roundtables between Ambassadors and members of the Administration to cultivate relationships” in areas including infrastructure and plans to “tie into international bilateral meetings already occurring with key members of the Trump Administration. This would include taking a leadership role in forming the events, the participants, and the agenda.”
Barrack’s company should do all this while keeping a low profile, seeking to build a “subtle brand,” the memo says.
A Colony spokesman said in a statement: “This memo was simply an outline of a proposed potential business plan which was never acted upon or implemented. Colony at no time has maintained a DC office.”
View note
A person familiar with the creation of the memo said it was written by Rick Gates, who was deputy chairman of the inaugural committee and was then hired by Barrack as a Colony consultant. The memo is on Colony letterhead. Gates, who was fired by Colony after he was indicted in Robert Mueller’s Russian interference investigation in October 2017, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Gates has pleaded guilty to conspiracy and lying to the FBI, and he is cooperating with law enforcement.
While Colony says the plan in the memo was never adopted, Barrack was frequently present at meetings with government officials in the early months of the Trump administration.
Calendars obtained by the watchdog group American Oversight show that Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin met at least three times with Colony executives in the four months following the inaugural.
An April 14 meeting with Mnuchin at a private room at the Georgetown restaurant Fiola Mare included the ambassadors of Oman, Kuwait, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Qatar and Saudi Arabia.
Also at the dinner: Tom Barrack and Rick Gates.
Barrack, who is of Lebanese descent and speaks Arabic, has cultivated business ties in the Middle East over many decades.
In early 2017, Gates and Barrack identified an investment idea based on the Trump administration’s emerging Middle East policy. Barrack threw his weight behind a proposal to spread nuclear power technology to Saudi Arabia, and considered buying a stake in U.S. reactor manufacturer Westinghouse, he told ProPublica in 2017. That plan stalled.
Much of the February 2017 memo outlines how Colony could capitalize on Trump’s public-private infrastructure proposals, which have not materialized.

Trump’s Inauguration Paid Trump’s Company — With Ivanka in the Middle
As the inaugural committee planned the landmark celebration, internal concerns were raised about whether Trump’s Washington hotel was overcharging for event space. The spending could be a violation of the law.
Another document obtained by WNYC and ProPublica — an invitation list for the Jan. 17, 2017, inaugural event, the Chairman’s Global Dinner — shows the breadth of Barrack’s international connections.
The dinner was billed as a celebration for Washington’s diplomatic corps, and it took a week to configure the Washington venue to accommodate the featured entertainment, a Las Vegas revue known as Steve Wynn’s Showstoppers. President-elect Trump gave a speech at the dinner.
In addition to ambassadors from around the world, over 100 guests from different walks of life are listed as being invited by Barrack.
Among them: Mohamed Alabbar, an Emirati property developer, Yousef Al Otaiba, the ambassador of the United Arab Emirates in Washington, and the ambassadors of Qatar and Saudi Arabia.
Barrack’s list also included Tennessee property developer Franklin Haney, who reportedly has drawn the focus of federal prosecutors in connection with his $1 million donation to the inaugural committee. Haney did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Some events that week were reserved for high-dollar donors. It’s not clear which guests may have paid to attend the Chairman’s Global Dinner, or what their contribution was. It’s also not clear which invited guests actually attended.
Colony, a publicly traded company, has not fared particularly well in the first two years of the Trump administration. A troublesome merger cost the company its CEO, and Barrack returned as chief executive last November.
One bright spot for Colony’s business in the Trump era has been more than $7 billion of inflows to its investment funds, a quarter of that from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, The New York Times reported in June.

Cubs ownership faces backlash after patriarch's racist, Islamophobic emails leaked

Texto completo: CHICAGO — The family that owns the Chicago Cubs was doing damage control Tuesday after a web site published a series of emails from patriarch Joe Ricketts that revealed racist and anti-Muslim sentiments.
Ricketts, the founder and former CEO of TD Ameritrade, helped his family bankroll the more than $800 million purchase of the Cubs, Wrigley Field, and 25% of the cable station Comcast Sportsnet Chicago in 2009 by selling 34 million shares of the online brokerage firm.
Ricketts, 77, apologized in a statement for the content of his emails that were published by the website Splinter News. His son, Cubs chairman Tom Ricketts, called the father’s emails “racially insensitive” and said “the language and views expressed in those emails have no place in our society. ”
He also sought to distance his father, a longtime backer of conservative politicians, from the baseball franchise, one of baseball’s most valuable and iconic Major League teams.
“My father is not involved with the operation of the Chicago Cubs in any way,” Tom Ricketts said in a statement. “I am trusted with representing this organization and our fans with a respect for people from all backgrounds. These emails do not reflect the culture we’ve worked so hard to build at the Chicago Cubs since 2009. ”
Beyond their ownership of the Cubs, three of the elder Joe Ricketts' children play high-profile roles in American politics. Pete Ricketts, a Republican, is the governor of Nebraska, and Todd Ricketts is the Republican National Committee finance chairman. His daughter, Laura Ricketts, is a prominent Democratic fundraiser and leader on LGBT issues.
Cubs executives on Tuesday also reached out to members of Chicago's Muslim community as they tried to soften blowback from the offensive emails.
“Tom and Cubs executive Julian Green (the Cubs vice president of communications and community affairs) spoke to one of the representatives of the community this morning and reached out to others,” Dennis Culloton, the Ricketts family spokesman, told USA TODAY. “We hope there will be a meeting or meetings. ”
The emails, from 2009 to 2013, included the elder Ricketts forwarding racist jokes and conspiracy theories and a message to his son, Pete, in which he refers to Islam as a “cult. ”
Joe Ricketts made the comment after Pete — who was elected governor of Nebraska in 2015 — admonished his father for forwarding him an email chain titled “Americans believe in religious freedom — Muslims don’t. ”
After his son responded that the elder Ricketts should research such articles before sending them on, Joe Ricketts replied: “Thanks Peter. However, I think Islam is a cult and not a religion. Christianity and Judaism are…based on love whereas Islam is based on ‘kill the infidel’ a thing of evil. ”
Pete Ricketts again nudged his father. “I am not sure that your statement is accurate with regards to Islam but I recommend reading the piece on snopes,” he wrote, referring to another web site.

In a May 2012 email written to someone identified as S. V. , Joe Ricketts opines on Iran’s nuclear ambitions. He first prefaces that his views are seen through the lens of someone who is "very conservative and selfish as I look at this as protecting my family. ”
“Christians and Jews can have a mutual respect for each other to create a civil society. As you know, Islam cannot do that,” Ricketts said. “Therefore we cannot ever let Islam become a large part of our society. Muslims are naturally my (our) enemy due to their deep antagonism and bias against non-Muslims. ”
Other emails that Ricketts forwarded debunked “birther” theories that former president Barack Obama was not born in the United States and jokes that used racial epithets for African-Americans and people from the Middle East.
Joe Ricketts expressed regret and apologized for the emails.
“Sometimes I received emails that I should have condemned. Other times I’ve said things that don’t reflect my value system,” Ricketts said in a statement. “I strongly believe that bigoted ideas are wrong. ”
Kamran Hussain, president of the city’s Muslim Community Center and 15-year season ticket holder, wrote a letter to the Ricketts family Tuesday in which he said the Cubs response had “fallen short and has the ring of PR or ‘damage control’ for most Muslims and others of good conscience in Chicago. ” Hussain urged the Ricketts family to meet with Chicago Muslims to clear the air.
Hussain said he long compartmentalized his love for the Cubs with his disapproval of Joe Ricketts' politics.
“I now have kids and they are getting older and they ask about things like Donald Trump and the wall,” Hussain said in an interview. “I don’t think I can keep compartmentalizing those things. ”
Some of the emails came in 2012. That year Ricketts had planned to bankroll a Super PAC that would fund racially-tinged, anti-Obama attack ads during the run-up to the 2012 presidential election, according to the New York Times.
Ricketts said he had no plans to run the ads after the New York Times report was published. Still, the episode soured his relationship with Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, a former chief of staff to Obama. Emanuel responded by rescinding plans for $150 million in public funding for renovations at Wrigley Field.
Emanuel recalled Tuesday that Ricketts once said that he did not share values with the mayor.
“Truer words were never spoken,” Emanuel said. “The ignorance and intolerance he has espoused are not welcome in Chicago. Those are not the values I learned from my parents, and those are not the values (my wife) Amy and I have instilled in our children. Joe Ricketts should consider himself lucky he has never met my mother. She would teach him a lesson. I am proud not to share his bigoted opinions. Hate has no home in Chicago. ”

Texto completo: As President Donald Trump addresses a joint Congress in his State of the Union Tuesday night, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi could be seen holding papers in front of her face during the president's speech.
Pelosi's reading quickly caught the attention of some on social media, and many wondered what she could be reviewing as the address continued.
Pelosi was looking over her copy of Trump's speech, a spokesperson confirmed to The New York Times.
Even though there was an explanation, images from cable news quickly tuned into memes, joking that Pelosi had brought reading material and guessing that it could be special counsel Robert Mueller's report on Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.

Relaxed abortion rules portend the dehumanization of us all

Texto completo: C.S. Lewis was only partly right when he wrote: The greatest evil ... is conceived and ordered (moved, seconded, carried and minuted) in clean, carpeted, warmed and well-lighted offices, by quiet men with white collars and cut fingernails and smooth-shaven cheeks who do not need to raise their voice.
Lewis, perhaps, couldn’t have envisioned the day when a law allowing abortion up to the moment of birth would receive a standing ovation, as occurred last month with New York’s passage of the absurdly named "Reproductive Health Act."
Upon signing the bill, which also permits some health care professionals who are not doctors to perform the abortions, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo ordered that One World Trade Center be illuminated in pink, hijacking the color associated with saving breast-cancer victims — and the birth of a baby girl.
What a weird, wicked world we live in.
Last Monday in Virginia, Del. Kathy Tran testified on behalf of a bill that would have simplified the process for having a late-term abortion. Currently, Virginia law requires three doctors’ approval for such a procedure. The bill, which was subsequently tabled, would’ve required only one’s. This was hardly the stuff of "infanticide," a word that began tumbling from the lips of certain critics, but Gov. Ralph Northam wasn’t helpful. Two days before his yearbook scandal broke, he talked during a radio interview about making distressed newborns "comfortable" while the family decides whether to resuscitate.
Just maybe we’re not very good at talking about the unspeakable.
Meanwhile, lawmakers in Rhode Island, Massachusetts, Vermont and other blue states are busy hammering out their own legal concoctions, likely concerned that Roe v. Wade will be overturned by the now-predominantly conservative Supreme Court. I leave others to argue the validity of those concerns, but my sources in the pro-life movement, including several legal scholars, think upending the decision is unlikely given that, in 1992, the court not only reinforced Roe but actually made the ruling stronger.
Regardless, the pro-choice movement has been preparing for such a frontal assault on the few abortion restrictions left to states. In 1973, when Roe was issued, a baby’s viability was set at 24-28 weeks. Today, thanks to technology and our finer understanding of human development, viability occurs around 22 weeks.
In New York City, where about two in five pregnancies are terminated, there will no longer be any presumption of humanity for the baby at any stage of pregnancy, which goes far beyond abortion jurisprudence. Most Americans are fully against such extreme approaches to abortion. One survey puts the share who support abortion during the third trimester at just 13 percent.
Like many if not most Americans, I have been reasonably at ease with President Clinton’s 1996 call for making abortion "safe, legal and rare," but had hoped we’d seriously pursue that goal through better information and limit abortion to the first trimester. But the pro-choice side has resisted many attempts to educate. Activists have opposed laws requiring that pregnant women have the option of viewing a sonogram before their abortion. They’ve also thwarted attempts to make adoption resources available at abortion clinics.
What are they afraid of? That someone may change her mind?
My own thinking about abortion was partly formed by having almost witnessed a "back-alley abortion" when a college friend sought an abortion in 1970 in Spain. We walked into a room with a white linoleum table over which, not kidding, a single light bulb hung. We bolted, called home for money, and put her on a plane to London for a legal abortion.
No one wants women to be subjected to such last resorts. But nor should we be celebrating laws that ignore the humanity of an unborn child. While there are only four doctors in the U.S. that perform third-trimester abortions and, obviously, "no one gets an abortion on the delivery table," as New York Times columnist Michelle Goldberg put it, the codification of late-term abortion should be discomfiting.
It is obvious, meanwhile, that these pro-abortion legislators’ new efforts are aimed at undoing, one by one, the state-level "victories" of their pro-life counterparts — even, apparently, if it means putting women’s lives at greater risk by allowing non-doctors to perform abortions.
But more concerning than a possible increase in late-term abortions (now at fewer than 2 percent of all pregnancy terminations) is the clinical way we’ve come to view and discuss human life. When we use language to disguise reality — whether the developing human baby is a "clump of cells," a "fetus," or, even, a "product of termination" — we move ever-closer to the dehumanization of us all.

Texto completo: URBANA -- Seven professors with more than $28 million worth of research power will join the University of Illinois faculty this year under a new program designed to recruit some of the world's best and brightest to the Urbana campus.
They include experts in artificial intelligence, biomedical imaging, business management, magnetics, neuroscience, chemical biology and cellular decision-making, from Harvard, Washington University and the University of Texas, among other schools.
They were hired under the President's Distinguished Faculty Recruitment Program, coordinated by Executive Vice President Barbara Wilson, which has now added 14 professors across the UI system -- 10 in Urbana, three in Chicago and one in Springfield.
The three-year, $60 million initiative was created in 2017 to fund startup packages to recruit faculty of national and international stature -- and counteract attempts by other schools to lure away top UI scholars.
The UI system is providing $10 million a year for the program, matched by the three campuses. The initial group of seven hires was announced in June.
"We are seeking the best minds worldwide to reimagine how we teach and learn new skills and how to innovate in a world where change is coming faster than ever," President Tim Killeen said in a prepared statement. "The investment we are making will pay dividends for years to come, shaping the lives of students and the breakthrough research discovery that drives progress."
One of the seven is Nancy Amato, announced last fall as the new head of the highly ranked Department of Computer Science. The award-winning researcher is widely recognized for her work in motion planning in robotics, used in such applications as autonomous driving and manufacturing.
She joined the UI in January from Texas A&M, where her research interests also include computational biology, computational geometry, and parallel and distributed computing. She has landed more than $114 million in research support.
The others are:
-- Mark Anastasio, a professor of biomedical engineering at Washington University in St. Louis, who will start in March as the new head of the Department of Bioengineering. He's an internationally recognized expert on tomographic image reconstruction, imaging physics and the development of computed biomedical imaging systems.
At Washington, he has conducted pioneering research in photoacoustic computed tomography, diffraction tomography and X-ray phase-contrast imaging. He received a Career Award in 2006 from the National Science Foundation, its most prestigious award for early career faculty. He has received more than $18 million in past and current research support.
-- Ido Golding, a physics professor who will return this year to the College of Engineering from Baylor College of Medicine. A biophysicist and expert in single-molecule and single-cell measurements of transcription, his research focuses on the diverse phenotypes exhibited by genetically identical cells.
His lab has made multiple contributions to understanding the processes of transcribing DNA to RNA, and of viral infection at the single-cell level. He also won an NSF Career Award in 2013 and has received more than $5.2 million in research funding. He was a founding member of the NSF Center for the Physics of Living Cells at the UI, where worked from 2007 to 2009.
-- Melissa Graebner, a professor of management at the University of Texas, who will start this fall in the Gies College of Business. Her areas of expertise are entrepreneurial strategy, mergers and acquisitions, and qualitative research methods.
Her work has been recognized by the Academy of Management and featured in The Economist, The New York Times DealBook and Forbes. She is co-editor of the Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal.
She previously worked for McKinsey & Co. in Chicago and San Francisco, where she consulted with Fortune 500 clients on merger and acquisition implementation as well as growth strategies.
-- Axel Hoffmann, a senior group leader in magnetic films at Argonne National Laboratory, who will start next fall in the College of Engineering. An award-winning researcher in magnetism-related topics, he was part of a research team that discovered a new method for creating nanoscale magnetic "bubbles" at room temperature, which could advance future methods for creating faster and more efficient computer memory systems.
He holds three magnetism-related U.S. patents.
-- Liviu Mirica, a professor of chemistry at Washington University, who started this semester in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences. He is an expert in the design of chemical agents that contain metal ions, and has studied the role of transition metal ions in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, which may lead to better imaging and diagnoses of the mind-robbing disease.
He has received more than $3.4 million in research support.
-- Uwe Rudolph, a professor of comparative biosciences who started last fall in the College of Veterinary Medicine. Previously at Harvard Medical School and McLean Hospital in Belmont, Mass., he is an internationally recognized scholar in neuroscience and pharmacology.
His research has helped lead to new strategies for the development of drugs controlling anxiety without sedation.
He also is at the forefront of identifying a compound that suppresses itching in mice and dogs.
He holds an honorary degree from Harvard and has received more than $8 million in research support.

Texto completo: "Well-Known Artist Alfred Hair Slain," read the headline in The Fort Pierce News Tribune newspaper in Florida.
But before he was killed in a barroom brawl on Aug. 9, 1970, at just 29, Hair had become more than just an artist. With his drive, charisma and business acumen, he helped start a collective of Floridian artists, all African-American, who painted vibrant landscapes of their home state. They would later come to be known as The Florida Highwaymen, or more simply The Highwaymen.
In the 1950s and '60s the artists produced an astonishing amount of works that they hocked along the roads and highways of Florida. More importantly they did so at a time and place where opportunities for black people were extremely limited. The Highwaymen paved their own way.
These enterprising artists did everything they could to scrape together a living through their art. They used inexpensive, accessible materials, painting on a building material called Upson board instead of on canvasses and making frames out of crown molding. They spurred each other on to paint faster, then competed to see who could sell the most.
Hair was the star of the group, having been among few in the group to receive formal training, from Albert Ernest Backus, a white artist known as Bean who became his mentor. Backus also mentored another Highwayman, Harold Newton.
Hair and Newton developed their own approach to capturing Florida in full color. More than anything, what distinguished the Highwaymen artists were their colorful landscapes, eschewing any formal color theory and relying on instinct and intuition to depict their steady stream of beaches, palm trees and Everglades scenes. Organic colors were not their main focus; they wanted to wow buyers with burnt-orange Florida skies or unnaturally florescent clouds.
The two were considered the best Highwaymen artists, with Newton the more technically accomplished and Hair the more lyrical and spontaneous.
But unlike Backus, there was no way Newton, Hair or any other black painter at that time in South Florida could expect to have their art displayed on gallery walls. Instead they took their work door-to-door to local businesses along the roads of coastal Florida.
The Highwaymen, more a movement than a group, grew as Hair and Newton invited others in their circles to participate.
"It was like spontaneous combustion," Gary Monroe, a Florida-based photographer and scholar of the Highwaymen, said in an email. "Alfred encouraged and welcomed all who had an inkling or expressed an interest in painting. There was no organization, no rules, dues or business plan -- just like-minded 20-somethings coming together."
In all experts have identified about 26 painters as part of the collective -- all men except for one, Mary Ann Carroll.
Hair was known to work on dozens of paintings at once. His technique was to mix a specific color and apply it across various canvasses at a time. He might start with blues, then progress with greens, red, oranges, and so on, creating 20 unique landscapes at a fast-moving pace to produce as much as he could. He sold his paintings for $20 or $25.
"He didn't do anything halfway," said his widow, Doretha Hair Truesdell, in 2014 in a video interview. (She later remarried.)
The fact that he was selling his paintings from the trunk of his own brand-new Cadillac pointed to a level of hard-earned achievement at a time and place where people of color were expected to be satisfied with modest lives, at best.
"But Alfred was not at all arrogant; to the contrary, he was openhanded and gregarious," Monroe wrote in his manuscript for a soon-to-be-published book. "His brother, Donald, puts it this way: 'Alfred didn't have a mean bone in his body. If he had $20, he'd gladly give it away. He knew he could make more. He was just unique.' "
Hair, who was believed to be selling around 50 paintings a week, swore he would be a millionaire by 35, a bold statement for a black man in the Jim Crow South. But he did not live long enough to achieve his lofty goal.
One day he was at Eddie's Place, a popular hangout for the Highwaymen, when he got into a fight with Julius Funderburk, a field worker.
"It is impossible to know precisely what happened as the beer flowed around the unfolding events," Monroe wrote. "The juke joint noise got louder and louder. The barroom became increasingly crowded and smokier and hot inside on that summer night. People came and went. It was clearly a sociable place, until a few minutes past 11 p.m. A few hours later Dr. H. L. Schofield would remove a single bullet from the body of Alfred Hair."
Some say Funderburk shot Hair out of frustration that he was not a part of the Highwaymen. Others said Hair, who had an ease with women, had been involved with Funderburk's girlfriend.
Whatever the reason, Hair's death precipitated the disbanding of the Highwaymen.
Alfred Warner Hair was born on May 20, 1941, and lived his whole life in Fort Pierce. He was one of seven children born to Samuel and Annie Mae Hair, along with his two brothers and four sisters. He is buried in the same town, at the Pine Grove Cemetery.
While many of the associated painters continued to work on their own well into the 1980s, eventually sales waned. It wasn't until the early 1990s that interest resurfaced, after a Florida art dealer named Jim Fitch, seeking to give the group recognition, gave the group its name, The Highwaymen. Later in 2001, Monroe wrote a seminal book about the group, further sealing interest in it.
Their work reflected a Florida that is no more, one of America's final frontiers.
"These unlikeliest of artists left the visual legacy of modern Florida," Monroe told The Times. "Their paintings are more than Florida art. It is an American art, as Florida was the place to realize the postwar American dream."
While some might downplay the group's work as industrial-level commercial art because of the assembly-line fashion in which they were created, a fascination with the paintings among a network of collectors reveals the depth behind their work. Today, the paintings hang on the walls of the likes of Michelle Obama and Shaquille O'Neal, and sell for as much as tens of thousands of dollars.

Texto completo: Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
As a Society News reporter at The New York Times, I've covered more than 7,000 weddings across three decades, from the current president's son to the son of a gun who refused to submit a photo, he said, "because, to tell you the truth, my fiancée and I are not very good looking."
If I may be a bit lyrical here:
I've also married, in print at least, scores of doctors, lawyers, handymen and corporate chiefs, as well as athletes, bartenders, mortgage lenders and father-daughter pastors with conflicting theological beliefs. They all arrived in various increment to be stamped with a kind of sacred ink that makes them news fit to print.
Nurses, actors, politicians, men and women in blue, soldiers, spacemen, musicians and M.B.A.'s and Ph.D.'s from N.Y.U. I thought I had covered every kind of "I Do," including a few, I swear to you, exchanged by two who had been on death row. I know. I know. But believe me, it's true.
Then came a call that topped them all -- from a public relations woman named Laurie Monteforte -- about a woman named Lilly Smartelli, 55, of Phoenix, who is dreaming about marrying her best friend, Bernie, who happens to be her dog.
The fact that there was only one human in this human-interest story that involved a bride and a groom had me thinking this was the mother of all publicity stunts.
So I called LeAnn Wilcox, the editor-in-charge of Society News with whom I've been collaborating on stories about weddings for nearly a quarter of a century. (We previously worked together for this newspaper's sports section.)
"I'll write it in color," I tell Ms. Wilcox after every assignment she gives me.
"Thanks," she always says back, "I'll edit it to black and white." (As I always tell her, there's humor in the repetition.)
My voice was full of sarcasm and doubt as I relayed the tabloid-like premise of Ms. Smartelli's tale to Ms. Wilcox.
"Wait, give it a chance," Ms. Wilcox said. "Call this woman and hear what she has to say. You know I'm not a fan of most Valentine's Day pitches. But this one is about feeling loved and comforted. And that's what the day should be about, not chocolates and flowers."
So I called Ms. Smartelli, and she moved me in a most tearful way. She is terminally ill, suffering from a form of pulmonary fibrosis, a respiratory disease.
"My doctors tell me I have maybe one or two good years left," she said, "so Bernie and I are racing against the clock."
Ms. Smartelli, who donated a kidney 12 years ago to a childhood friend in Detroit, is still trying to save lives, while at the same time, keeping alive her own childhood dream: to know the joy of a wedding day.
She can do that, she said, by "symbolically marrying Bernie."
"I can use the venue to stage a fund-raising event that would draw attention to organ-donor groups and animal welfare shelters that lack proper funding," she said, "and still get to experience the thrill of having a wedding, even if it's a fake wedding."
With no significant other in her life, she chose Bernie, a 9-year-old cocker spaniel-poodle mix, to stand in as her groom.
"It would all be in good fun," she said.
Ms. Smartelli, who maintained a sense of humor throughout our conversation, wondered what her wedding announcement might look like in The Times, so I obliged her. Lilly and Bernie were married on Valentine's Day at St. Bernard Church in New York. The Rev. Jack Russell, one of man's best friends, officiated.
Mrs. Bernie, 55, who was radiant in a bone-white gown, and Mr. Bernie, 54 (dog years), flealess in a rhinestoned collar, exchanged puptials before a litter of family and friends.
The bride, who graduated from Wayne State University in Detroit, was a travel nurse. The groom, who graduated from Obedience School, works from home, keeping the yard free of squirrels.
The couple met in Palm Springs, Calif., in October 2011, during a county fair adoption for shelter dogs. "He couldn't keep his paws off me," the bride joked. Ms. Wilcox liked what she heard after I told her about my interview, and let me write the story about Ms. Smartelli and her dog, Bernie.
Hers is a poignant, and colorful, tale.

Texto completo: More than 100 years ago, one of the most popular spectator sports in the world was bicycle racing, and one of the most popular racers was a squat, strapping man with bulging thighs named Major Taylor.
He set records in his teens and was a world champion at 20. He traveled the globe, racing as far away as Australia, and amassed wealth among the greatest of any athlete of his time. Thousands of people flocked to see him; newspapers fawned over him.
Major Taylor was the "Black Cyclone," at once the LeBron James and Jackie Robinson of his time. He blew past racial barriers in an overwhelmingly white field bent on stopping him, sometimes violently.
He was the first African-American world champion in cycling and the second black athlete to win a world championship in any sport.
So consider this: He died penniless in 1932, at age 53, and was buried in a pauper's grave.
The head-spinning arc of Taylor's life is a story too little told.
He endured racial hostility -- including a brutal beating at a race and more than one episode of sabotage on the course -- yet he persevered and professed to bear no animosity.
"Life is too short for a man to hold bitterness in his heart," he wrote in his self-published 1928 autobiography, "The Fastest Bicycle Rider in the World: The Story's Indomitable Courage and Success Against Great Odds."
He lived a life of triumph and tragedy seemingly made for Hollywood, yet by the end of his life could barely sell copies of his book.
"To imagine what he went through in the 1890s is unimaginable," Edwin Moses, an Olympic gold medalist in track and the honorary chairman of the Major Taylor Association, said in a telephone interview. "I could not imagine competing and being a winner with what he put up with."
Major Taylor was not actually a major.
Marshall Walter Taylor was born in Indianapolis on Nov. 26, 1878, one of eight children of Gilbert and Saphronia (Kelter) Taylor. He acquired his nickname as a boy doing bicycle tricks outside a cycle shop while dressed in a military uniform to attract customers.
The shop's owner, Tom Hay, entered Taylor in his first race, a 10-miler, and he won by six seconds. He was 13.
But despite his victories and his jaw-dropping times, Taylor was not allowed to join cycling clubs in Indiana and was barred from tracks. So a savvy racing manager and bicycle manufacturer named Louis Munger, known as Birdie, persuaded him to move to Worcester, Mass.
"I was in Worcester only a very short time before I realized that there was no such race prejudice existing among the bicycle riders there as I had experienced in Indianapolis," Taylor wrote in his autobiography.
In 1896, Munger entered Taylor in a grueling six-day race at Madison Square Garden (a television commercial for Hennessy cognac, released last year, celebrates his performance in that race). It crushed him physically but catapulted him, just after his 18th birthday, into the world of professional cycling.
"He had to be terrified," said Karen Brown-Donovan, his great-granddaughter, in an email, adding, "especially since he was the only person of color on the track."
"The fact that he lasted for the duration of the six-day race was astonishing," she said.
In 1899, he shocked the world by winning the one-mile sprint at the world championship in track cycling, the second black athlete, after the Canadian bantamweight boxer George Dixon, to win a world title in a recognized sport.
But for all his newfound celebrity, racism still held him back, even in Worcester.
When he moved into a new house, his neighbors at first tried to get him to relocate.
And with Jim Crow laws in full force, he wasn't spared on the track, either.
Ice water was thrown at him and nails laid in the path of his bicycle by members of rival racing teams. Riders routinely jostled and elbowed him -- and he still won.
Perhaps the worst incident, covered in The New York Times, was in September 1897. After a one-mile race in which Taylor placed second, the third-place finisher, William Becker, "wheeled up behind Taylor and grabbed him by the shoulder. The colored man was thrown to the ground, Becker choked him into a state of insensibility, and the police were obliged to interfere."
Becker accused Taylor of crowding him, something nobody else saw. He was later fined $50 but was allowed to continue racing.
The hotbed of cycling was Europe, but it took some time before Taylor would compete there. Many of the races were on Sundays, and Taylor, a devout Baptist since his mother's death in 1898, refused to race then -- a conviction that inspired the Otis Taylor blues song "He Never Raced on Sunday."
Still, Taylor had become so famous that race organizers eventually moved events to weekdays to accommodate him. He was embraced in France and beat every European champion, further sealing his iconic status.
"Major Taylor had a proud and confident identity in Europe and was not a crushed or threatened black man," Andrew Ritchie wrote in his 1988 biography, "Major Taylor: The Extraordinary Career of a Champion Bicycle Racer."
As The Times marveled during a 1903 tour in Australia, "he has won many big prizes and is making money at a rapid rate."
Eventually, age and younger competitors caught up with Taylor. He retired in 1910, then struggled to capitalize on his success. Interest in cycling was fading as the automobile captivated the public. He made bad investments -- including the self-published autobiography -- and his savings were further devastated by the 1929 stock market crash, all but erasing his fortune. His health declined and his marriage, to Daisy Victoria Morris in 1902, fell apart.
"Once he was done as a sports person his opportunities dried up," said Todd Balf, author of "Major: A Black Athlete, a White Era, and the Fight to Be the World's Fastest Human Being," published in 2008. "I can only imagine the stress and strain of trying to make a go of it."
He moved to Chicago, rented a room at a YMCA and tried going door-to-door to sell the book, "but there was no second chance after he retired from racing," Ritchie said.
He died on June 21, 1932, alone and largely forgotten, his body unclaimed in the morgue. There was a short obituary in the African-American newspaper The Chicago Defender.
"This was a tragic event for someone who had received so much acclaim during his lifetime," said Brown-Donovan, his great-granddaughter. Her grandmother Sydney Taylor Brown (named for the city she was born in) was his only child.
"My grandmother always hated that he died this way," she said. "She didn't know he was so ill."
Before he left for Chicago, Taylor gave his daughter "every tangible memory of his cycling career -- his journals, scrapbooks, photos, trophies, medals, letters, etc.," Brown-Donovan continued. "This is why my grandmother became a fierce protector of his legacy for the rest of her own life. People know about Major Taylor today because of Sydney Taylor Brown."
Cycling today remains a predominantly white sport, though a number of athletes have come to know and be inspired by Taylor's story and several cycling clubs have adopted his name.
Still, "at the pro level, there has never been anybody who walked in his shoes," Balf said.
Taylor's body was in a pauper's grave for years in Mount Glenwood Memory Gardens, near Chicago. In 1948, a group of former racing stars had him reburied, with financial assistance from Frank Schwinn of the Schwinn Bicycle Company, in the cemetery's Garden of the Good Shepherd. There is now a memorial outside the Worcester Public Library as well.
The plaque on his grave reads:
World's champion bicycle racer who
came up the hard way without hatred in his heart,
an honest, courageous, and God-fearing, clean living gentlemanly athlete,
A credit to his race who always gave out his best. Gone but not forgotten
1878-1932

Texto completo: More than a half century before a "curvy" model made the cover of the Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue, and before hashtags like #allbodiesaregoodbodies, there was a designer who knew that it was the job of clothes to fit the woman, not vice versa.
Zelda Wynn Valdes was a designer to the stars who could fit a dress to a body of any size -- even if she had to do so just by looking at the client. "I only fit her once in 12 years," Valdes told The New York Times in 1994 of her long-time client Ella Fitzgerald, "I had to do everything by imagination for her." Valdes would simply look at Fitzgerald in the latest paper, noting any changes in her full-figured body, and would design the elaborate gowns -- with beads and appliques -- that she knew Fitzgerald loved.
Valdes began her career in the peak years of Jim Crow segregation, when black seamstresses were largely low-wage earning service industry workers. The title "designer" or "couturier" was typically reserved for esteemed white men.
Seamstresses were deemed problem solvers, while couturiers were lauded as genius innovators. It wouldn't be easy for Valdes to break the racial barrier into the world of haute couture custom design.
Valdes's earliest impulses to design clothing likely came not from wanting to dismantle Jim Crow but from a desire to create. She was born on June 18, 1905, into a working-class family in Chambersburg, Pa. Her fondness for sewing and pattern-making developed alongside her training as a classical pianist with the Catholic Conservatory of Music. By the time she was 13, she was a skilled musician who was wowing her family members with the dresses she made for them.
After graduating from high school in the early 1920s, she moved to White Plains, where she got a job at a posh boutique. The position was as a stockroom worker, but Valdes had a plan: She would accept the job in the back, tucked away from white clients, but would eventually shine in the front of the store as a seamstress. And she did. In recalling the job for The New York Times in 1994, she said: "It wasn't a pleasant time. But the idea was to see what I could do."
She quickly gained a reputation as a seamstress with a keen, artistic eye and technical precision and opened her own boutique. It was there that she defined her signature style: a mix of the effortless glamour of her grandmother, whose dresses had all been handmade, and the luxury of the boutique's jetsetter clientele.
Valdes worked with only the finest textiles, and her garments were unabashedly feminine. She turned silk organza, crepe, hammered satin and Italian knit jersey into slinky, curve-hugging evening gowns, with intricate hand beading and sequins. She also made elegant bridal gowns and dresses that could shift from work days to cocktail hours. These garments were the highlights of fashion shows Valdes organized for various black social clubs and fund-raisers in the region.
The fashion shows helped Valdes find a loyal clientele of black women in New York City, where she opened her boutique, Zelda Wynn, on Broadway and West 158th Street, in 1948. It became a haven for black women who had felt the sting of racism while shopping at white-owned stores. She mostly designed for socialites and the wives of famous black men, such as Edna Mae Robinson, the wife of the boxer Sugar Ray Robinson. She even designed and made all of the bridal attire for the crooner couple Nat King Cole and Maria Ellington.
After the Cole wedding, the glittery stars of screen and stage began seeking her out. She designed clothing for Marian Anderson, Dorothy Dandridge, Josephine Baker, Eartha Kitt, Ruby Dee, Diahann Carroll, Mae West and Marlene Dietrich. Years later, Valdes would tell The Times: "I have a God-given talent for making people beautiful."
Valdes was also instrumental in forming the National Association of Fashion and Accessories Designers in 1949 to elevate other black female designers while helping them build networks, address discrimination in the workplace and promote racial diversity in the fashion industry.
In the late 1950s, she moved her operation to Midtown, where she opened Chez Zelda. She helmed a staff of nine dressmakers at the new shop, which was adjacent to Carnegie Hall. The location created even more exclusivity around her brand: Valdes was now a queen of the custom market. Her clients were paying nearly $1,000 to have a Zelda Wynn couture gown.
In the early 1960s Valdes forged a relationship with Hugh Hefner and his chain of nightclubs and resorts known as the Playboy Club. Hefner was looking for an outfit for the waitresses, and some have said that he approached Valdes. But there has since been some debate over who came up with the costume's design.
Journalists writing immediately after Valdes's death overstated her involvement, even going so far as to say she "invented" the iconic outfit. In recent years, some cultural critics have built upon those stories, further miscrediting Valdes as being the sole creator of the garment.
What's more plausible is that Valdes and her team were among those commissioned to manufacture some of the garments. Many people were said to have had a hand in the design, and Nancy Deihl wrote in "The Hidden History of American Fashion" (2018) that Valdes and her dressmakers "fabricated at least thirty-five costumes."
What we do know is that by the time Hefner met Valdes, she was just as much of a boss as he was, with the black press touting her as "internationally famous." Valdes parlayed her relationship with the mogul into an opportunity to expand her brand, hosting dazzling fashion shows before the Playboy Club's integrated crowd, billed as "Zelda at the Playboy."
Valdes went on to have a storied career. She later taught fashion design classes to Harlem youth and co-founded the Harlem Youth Orchestra with Lester Wilson in the mid-1960s.
In 1970, she began designing costumes and touring with the Dance Theater of Harlem, a position she would hold for more than two decades. One of Valdes's innovations was dyeing each dancer's tights to match their skin tone. Until then, black dancers had spent their careers wearing pink tights that were supposed to mimic the flesh of white dancers, underscoring the racial uniformity of classical ballet.
And now -- thanks in part to Valdes's pioneering efforts -- dancers of color can buy point shoes in their own skin tone.
By the time Valdes died on Sept. 26, 2001, at 96, she had done it.
She was a couturier.

Texto completo: PHILADELPHIA -- Jacqueline Watson needed money. Her son had called her that morning from prison, where he is serving a life sentence, to ask her to make a deposit in his phone account. She didn't have cash, but she did have something she could sell quickly and legally -- her blood.
So, on a crisp Monday morning in November, she traveled 40 minutes by bus to CSL Plasma, a blood plasma collection center wedged between a Dollar Tree and a Wells Fargo bank in a strip mall in North Philadelphia.
"What always brings me here is money," Ms. Watson, 46, said, as she waited in line to get her vitals taken. "I'm doing it for him, I guess you could say." She earns about $30 each time she donates.
The plasma business is booming in the United States, with the number of collection centers like this one more than doubling since 2005, and global sales roughly quadrupling since 2000 to be more than $21 billion in 2017. Many developed countries have banned paying people for their blood, but not the United States. Blood products made up 1.9 percent of all American exports in 2016, more than soybeans, more than computers.
Plasma -- the golden liquid that transports red and white blood cells and proteins through our bodies -- is something of an elixir. It's used to create lifesaving medicines for people with hemophilia, immune disorders, burns and other painful conditions, and it cannot be replicated in a lab.
The market for those medicines is "projected to grow radiantly by 2023," according to a report from Market Research Future. But there is an underside to all that growth: The industry depends on the blood of the very poor.
Ethicists, sociologists, business executives and "plassers" themselves, as the donors are sometimes called, are increasingly asking: Is the business exploitative, taking advantage of desperate people? Or is it beneficial, offering much-needed income to those who have few avenues to make money? Should we encourage people to sell their lifeblood so frequently, or make it harder to do so?
The Plasma Protein Therapeutics Association, a trade group, disputes the idea that the industry depends on desperate people.
"When I go to centers, what I see in those centers is people of all walks of life. You see mothers, you see students, you see employed people, you see unemployed people," said Jan Bult, the group's president and chief executive.
But plasma companies locate their collection centers disproportionately in destitute neighborhoods, according to Heather Olsen, who, as a graduate student researcher at Case Western Reserve University, examined 40 years of data on collection centers across the country. "They're surgically placing these," she said.
Healthy people can donate plasma twice a week, up to 104 times a year. The plasma industry says that most people do not donate so frequently and that there are minimal health risks involved, but other researchers disagree. One 2010 study found that paid donors who sell their plasma frequently have fewer proteins in their blood, which some experts say could put them at risk for infections and liver and kidney disorders. In the short term, plassers have reported fatigue, tingling sensations, anemia and blacking out.
Nonetheless, many are grateful for the opportunity. The money that comes from it can be the only form of cash income for families living in extreme poverty, as Luke Shaefer and Kathryn Edin note in their book "$2 a Day."
A number of people at the CSL collection center in North Philadelphia last November confirmed that the money they received there was their only income; they were putting it toward food, rent and bus fare. Some, like Kevin Hayway, were veteran plasma sellers; he estimated that he had sold his plasma more than 100 times a year for the past three years. Robert Jenkins said he had learned about the center when he was living at a homeless shelter; residents there recommended it as a good place to make fast cash. He planned to spend the money on food, starting at a McDonald's across the parking lot. First-time donors like Mr. Jenkins are paid the most, around $50; after five donations, payment is based on body weight, plus bonuses.
Mr. Shaefer, the poverty scholar, said the solution was not to ban the practice, but instead for policymakers to have a real debate about the risks. He suggested they might consider enforcing a minimum wage for plasma sellers.
"Ideally," he said, "I'd like to have a good discussion about what a fair price is."
His idea has some precedent: Selling whole blood used to be reputable, with professional blood sellers living in collective boardinghouses and even forming a union in the 1930s, according to Rose George's book "Nine Pints." During World War II, a biochemist figured out how to separate plasma, which can be dried, from whole blood, which was perishable and difficult to ship to the front. Soon after, the plasma industry was born.
In the decades after the war, a growing body of research suggested that the blood supply would be healthier and safer if people voluntarily donated. In the 1970s, the Food and Drug Administration began requiring that whole blood be labeled either a voluntary or paid donation. Blood that had been paid for came to be seen as both morally and physically tainted, according to Ms. George; today, the Red Cross will not use it. The F.D.A. requirement never applied to plasma, perhaps because it is broken down and processed before entering another person's body.
The medicines manufactured from plasma do save lives. Seth Kaufman, a 44-year-old marketing executive and volunteer for the Immune Deficiency Foundation, had been sick most of his life, in and out of the hospital with relentless ear and sinus infections.
Finally, when Mr. Kaufman was 36, his condition was diagnosed as an immunoglobulin deficiency, meaning his blood lacked crucial antibodies, and he was prescribed a medicine derived from human plasma. Now he can work and travel and play with his children without fear of contracting a debilitating lung infection.
"When I tell you that this changed my life, it's a massive understatement," Mr. Kaufman said.
I wanted to see exactly what type of screening donors went through to provide the plasma for people like Mr. Kaufman, so I donated plasma at a CSL Plasma clinic in Linden, N.J., in a strip mall next to a shuttered Pay Half store.
I watched a 23-minute safety video; my finger was pricked and my temperature was taken; I answered 63 questions, from whether I had lived with someone with hepatitis in the past 12 months to whether I had ever received money for sex; and my arms and ankles were examined for needle sticks.
This screening is robust but not fail-proof: In a survey of plasma donors at a CSL Plasma clinic in Ohio, Ms. Olsen found that 13 percent reported they had misled clinic workers about their health in order to donate.
For three hours of my time and 689 mL of my plasma, I made $50, which was given to me on a prepaid debit card that charges a small fee when used.
It made me wonder: Why, if money was changing hands, do plasma collection centers still use the language of donation?
Harriet Washington, a bioethics lecturer at Columbia and the author of the book "Medical Apartheid," said the semantics can mask the more troubling realities of the industry.
"It's really important to understand that the profit motive has sometimes been shown to outweigh concern for people's health," Ms. Washington said. "The problem with using words like 'donors' is that it creates the assumption of beneficence."
Mr. Hayway, who donates twice weekly, said he originally came for the money, but he liked that his plasma was helping people, too. He's just not sure he's getting a fair shake.
A donation of plasma, for which he will be paid about $30, will yield roughly $300 worth of wholesale immunoglobulin, according to Roger Kobayashi, a clinical professor at the UCLA School of Medicine.
"I know they get a lot of money," Mr. Hayway said of the companies that run the plasma centers. "I would say they should pay more, but that's just my opinion."

Texto completo: Alas, Michael Bloomberg. You aren't the man I thought you were.
On Tuesday, asked about Elizabeth Warren's (very smart) proposal for a wealth tax, he responded with the favorite right-wing calumny of the moment - suggesting that her plan would turn us into Venezuela.
That's a shameful line of argument. In fact, whenever you see someone invoking Venezuela as a reason not to consider progressive policy ideas, you know right away that the person in question is uninformed, dishonest or both. It basically shows that the speaker or writer isn't willing to engage in serious discussion, preferring to scare people with a boogeyman of which he or she knows nothing.
What, after all, do we learn from the Venezuelan experience? Yes, the country is a mess. Venezuela has always been a one-industry economy, with huge inequality. Hugo Chavez got into power because of rage against the nation's elite, but used the power badly. He seized the oil sector, which you only do if you can run it honestly and efficiently; instead, he turned it over to corrupt cronies, who degraded its performance. Then, when oil prices fell, his successor tried to cover the income gap by printing money. Hence the crisis.
It's a bad story, and not without precedent: "Macroeconomic populism" has a long history in Latin America, and usually comes to grief.
But what, exactly, does any of this have to do with the policy ideas of Elizabeth Warren, or Kamala Harris, or even a genuine radical like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez? Is anyone in U.S. politics, even those who call themselves socialists, proposing that we nationalize large parts of the private sector? Is there anything in the record of U.S. progressives suggesting that they are less fiscally responsible than the people who keep using voodoo economics to push massive tax cuts for the rich?
Look at the actual content of Warren's proposal, and it's Teddy Roosevelt, not Hugo Chavez. Harris' call for single-payer health care would put us in the same category as socialist hellholes like  Canada. Ocasio-Cortez has suggested tax rates for very high incomes that nobody would endorse except, um, Nobel laureate experts in public finance, and that have never been implemented in any country except, well, the United States for the whole of its great postwar boom.
Maybe you disagree with all these policy ideas. But if your first response, literally, is to scream "Venezuela," you're demonstrating both your unscrupulousness and your lack of any serious arguments for your position.
In Bloomberg's case, one can hope that this was a one-time lapse, brought on by too much time spent talking to other billionaires and those who try to please them. But from now on, here's my rule: Anyone who tries to use Venezuela as a cudgel in U.S. political debate doesn't deserve to be part of that debate.

Trump Jr.'s calls weren't to father

Texto completo: For more than a year, congressional Democrats have pushed to unlock a mystery they said could reveal whether Donald Trump had advance knowledge of a meeting his eldest son had in the summer of 2016 with a Russian lawyer promising damaging material about Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
The key, they said, was to determine who was using blocked telephone numbers to speak to Donald Trump Jr. before and after the meeting in Trump Tower, suggesting he may have communicated with his father on a private line.
But Senate investigators have concluded the blocked calls were conversations between Trump Jr. and two longtime business associates: Howard Lorber, a real estate investor who has done business in Russia, and Brian France, the chief executive of NASCAR, according to two people familiar with the determination.
The findings were first reported by CNN and ABC News.
France did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
A spokesman for Lorber said Friday that the real estate magnate "does not recall conversations with Donald Trump Jr. in the summer of 2016," adding that Lorber never discussed "any Russian matters" with the president's son.
Lorber is a longtime friend of the elder Trump, and the two went to Moscow in 1996 to scout for a real estate deal that never materialized, according to people familiar with the visit. The trip helped spur Trump's interest in seeking other ways over the years to build a tower in Moscow.
President Trump has long denied he knew about the Trump Tower gathering in 2016, which was attended by Trump Jr., his brother-in-law Jared Kushner and Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort.
At the meeting, Trump Jr. was expecting a Russian lawyer linked to the Kremlin to share dirt on Clinton, he later told Congress, but she instead pressed him on a U.S. law levying sanctions on Russia for human rights abuses.
The president and his allies seized on conclusions by congressional investigators, saying the findings undercut Democratic efforts to raise questions about links between Trump and Russia's interference in the 2016 campaign.
"The big deal, very mysterious Don jr telephone calls, after the innocent Trump Tower meeting, that the media & Dems said were made to his father (me), were just conclusively found NOT to be made to me. ... Really sad," the president tweeted late Thursday.
"This Witch Hunt must end!" he added.
In his own tweet, Trump Jr. wrote: "More of the Democrat's #fakenews narrative disappearing before their eyes. I wonder how many more false leaks will pop now to keep their dreams alive???"
Trump Jr. told the Senate Judiciary Committee in 2017 that his father had no knowledge of the June 2016 meeting with the Russians.
Democrats, led by Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., who now chairs the House intelligence committee, were skeptical of Trump Jr.'s account, noting that his first explanations of the meetings were misleading.
In a July 8, 2017, statement to The New York Times, Trump Jr., said meeting participants "primarily discussed a program about the adoption of Russian children." The statement did not mention that he was promised damaging information about Clinton -- or that Trump Jr. had responded enthusiastically to the offer.
"If it's what you say I love it," he wrote in an email to an associate who offered to set up the meeting.
Democrats raised questions about phone calls made by Trump Jr. on June 6, 2016, that they thought might show that Trump's son informed his father about the meeting in advance.
At 4:04 p.m. that day, phone records show, Emin Agalarov, a wealthy Russian who helped arrange the meeting, called Trump Jr.
Phone records show Trump Jr. called Agalarov at 4:31 p.m. Between those two calls, phone records show that Trump Jr. was connected with a blocked phone number.
Trump Jr. told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he did not remember whom he spoke with at that time, but others testified at the time that his father uses a blocked line.
Democratic members of the House intelligence committee pushed for information on the blocked numbers for more than a year. But House Republicans rebuffed efforts to subpoena the phone records, according to Schiff.
Schiff told MSNBC that he would continue his efforts to "find out who Don Jr. was talking to about that meeting at Trump Tower."
"Those conversations could have taken place over the phone, or they could have taken place by Don Jr. walking down the hall to talk to his dad," he added Thursday.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump on Friday suggested he might announce that he will take executive action affecting the southern border wall, without involving Congress, during or after his State of the Union address next week.
Trump, speaking to reporters at an event on human trafficking, again cast doubt on the bipartisan conference committee negotiating a deal on border security and federal spending bills to avert another shutdown when funding runs out on Feb. 15.
Trump hinted he might declare a national emergency to allow him to build more border walls without Congress appropriating funds for it, saying that "there's a good chance we'll have to do that" and that "we're going to make a big step in the next week or so."
Asked when he might declare a national emergency, Trump said, "I don't want to say it, but you'll hear the State of the Union, and then you'll see what happens right after the State of the Union."
Pressed on whether he'll make the announcement during his speech, Trump said, "Well, I'm saying listen closely to the State of the Union. I think you'll find it very exciting."
Later Friday, a senior administration official at the White House outlined the top five issues Trump will cover in his nationally televised address Tuesday evening, leading off with his plan for "a safe and legal immigration system."
The official offered no details on what Trump would say or whether he would declare a national emergency in the speech. "The president will reaffirm his determination to stop illegal immigration, human trafficking and the flow of drugs and crime," the official said.
Trump also will urge Congress to seek common ground on trade and approve the new treaty with Canada and Mexico; investments in infrastructure; lowering health care and drug costs, and protect national security and end the foreign wars, the official said.
Trump told The New York Times in a Thursday interview that "the wall will get built one way or another," hours after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) declared there will be no money for a wall in any bipartisan compromise deal reached by the conference committee.
Although Trump and Pelosi have ratcheted up their criticism of each other - and hardened their positions on a border wall - the senior administration official said the president intends to present an optimistic vision and appeal to bipartisanship in his national address.
"The president will express confidence in a hopeful future and encourage Congress to reject the politics of resistance and retribution and instead adopt a spirit of cooperation and compromise, so we can achieve it," the official said.
But speaking to reporters Friday at the White House, Trump unloaded on Pelosi and Democrats in their deadlock over their differing views of border security.
Trump said Republicans on the conference committee want to include funding for a wall, but Democrats are instructed not to do a wall "because they think it's good politics for 2020."

Texto completo: AMHERST — Despite sharp criticism from students, professors, and alumni, the trustees of Hampshire College on Friday evening announced the school will not admit a full freshman class this fall, plunging its future into further uncertainty.
The school will accept only those students who had already been granted a spot at Hampshire through deferred admissions or the early-decision process — about 60 in all. College officials have pledged to keep the school open and are looking for a partner to merge with.
“This is a time of extreme anxiety," board chair Gaye Hill told a crowd gathered at the campus athletic center. Her speech was cut short by the chants of students angered by the decision.
Hill spoke at a 7:30 p.m. meeting that capped a tense 24 hours on campus. Students held demonstrations and sit-ins, urging trustees to take more time before they made a decision. When students and alumni finally gathered to hear the news, they formed a ring around the gymnasium, joining hands. When the news came, some, including several trustees, shed tears.
Hampshire, known for its alternative education model with no grades or majors, is the lastest liberal arts college to cast itself as a victim of the nationwide decline in high school graduates and the increasing inability of families to afford expensive tuition.
Miriam Nelson, who took over as Hampshire president last summer, announced two weeks ago that the school, while solvent, would like to merge with another educational institution. She also said then the college might not admit a new class this fall.
But ever since Nelson's announcement, administrators have faced outrage from students, professors, staff, and alumni, who all say they were blindsided by the decision.
Prominent author and alumnus Jon Krakauer published a column in the New York Times this week worrying about the college's future.
“The transparency situation has been so horrifying for so many students," said Alison Smith, a first-year student from outside Baltimore.
On Thursday, several hundred students made signs and marched across campus and swarmed a lecture hall where trustees were deliberating.
“Students are scared," said Emery Powell, a third-year student from Brooklyn, at a protest on Thursday ahead of the board's vote that she helped organize. “This community needs time to hear more."
Hampshire College enrolled its first class of students in 1970. It was created by the presidents of the other four colleges in the Pioneer Valley — Smith College, Mount Holyoke College, Amherst College, and the University of Massachusetts Amherst — and was conceptualized as an experiment in a new type of educational model.
So far none of the four founding schools have said they would like to merge with Hampshire.
Alumni, meanwhile, had begun a fund-raising campaign to help make possible a full freshman class this fall. A crowdfunding site raised $219,000 in 48 hours toward the cause, including a $100,000 pledge from Adele Simmons, the third president of Hampshire.
Several Hampshire graduates said they do not believe the school made a good-faith fundraising effort in the years leading up to this announcement. They said they approached many wealthy graduates themselves who told them they were never contacted by the college.
Joan Wattman, who enrolled in Hampshire's fourth class of students in 1974, said she contacted Hampshire voluntarily last fall and pledged $25,000 for a scholarship. The school accepted her offer but never mentioned any hint of financial stress, she said.
“I don't feel like there has been a concerted effort to try to fund-raise," she said.
Steve Aronstein, who helped set up the crowdsourcing effort and started at Hampshire in 1989, said the school has always survived on a shoestring budget and idealism.
“We've always been in trouble; that's how Hampshire operates, hand to mouth, for 50 years," he said.
A group of faculty, staff, and alumni also recently penned a letter in response to the announcement urging the president to accept a new class. It expressed worry about layoffs that could follow such a decision.
Hampshire administrators, meanwhile, say the school explored many options and chose to make itself available for a merger before it is in a true financial crisis.
Two weeks ago Nelson assured students and faculty that the college will not close, but she said it is searching for other educational institutions that it could merge with as soon as this summer.
“We've always run lean and always been underfunded. But it's unsustainable for us to continue living the equivalent of paycheck to paycheck," the president wrote on the school's website.
Small colleges across the country are struggling as the pool of college-going high schoolers shrinks. The schools are also in trouble because families are increasingly unable to pay the high tuition prices at these schools.
Hampshire, for example, costs $50,000 per year for tuition plus another $14,000 for room and board. Schools offer scholarships, of course, but that comes off their bottom line.
Hampshire has a modest $52 million endowment and depends heavily on student tuition to operate.
The fate of Hampshire is being closely watched by other colleges in New England and across the country. Green Mountain College in Vermont announced its closure just last week, and several other schools are on probation with college accreditors over concerns about their finances. Newbury College in Brookline will also close this spring.
Amid the more challenging environment, several regulatory agencies including the regional accrediting agency and the state Board of Higher Education have become more strict in their oversight of schools.
As students filed out of the gymnasium on Friday and into the sub-freezing air, many struggled to process what this will mean for their future.
“It'll continue to be a stressful and difficult time for students and faculty and staff," said Eric Palmer, a fourth-year student from outside Philadelphia.
Another student, Daniel Schmidt, said he is not entirely pessimistic. The first-year student from St. Louis said he will wait to see whom the college might merge with. He doesn't want to transfer if he doesn't have to.
“Hampshire is a really special place," he said.

Texto completo: Senator Elizabeth Warren has tried to put a nagging controversy behind her by apologizing privately to a leader of the Cherokee Nation for her decision to take a DNA test to prove her Native American ancestry last year, a move that had angered some tribal leaders and ignited a significant political backlash.
But mixed reactions among prominent Native American critics Friday suggested that Ms. Warren might still have further to go.
Some Native American leaders gave her credit for the apology and political figures, for the most part, played down the issue.
But others remain unsatisfied.
"This still isn't transparent," said Twila Barnes, a Cherokee genealogist who has been critical of Ms. Warren's claims of native ancestry since it became national news in 2012. "She needs to go public and say she fully takes responsibility and that the DNA test was ridiculous. There is still something about this that feels off."
The private apology comes as Ms. Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, is set to formally launch her presidential run next week after recent visits to early nominating states like Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina. It also comes after repeated calls for her to apologize from tribal leaders, political operatives, and her own advisers, who said her October decision to take the DNA test gave undue credence to the controversial claim that race could be determined by blood -- and politically, played into President Trump's hands.
Mr. Trump has repeatedly mocked Ms. Warren for her decades-old claim of Native American ancestry, using slurs such as "Pocohantas" to dismiss her and recently saying she fell for his "Pocohantas trap." However, when Ms. Warren hit back at Mr. Trump and released a DNA test to prove her ancestry, she angered members of the Native American community and left-leaning Democrats who believe cultural kinship and tribal sovereignty determines Native citizenship, not blood.
On Thursday, Ms. Warren called Bill John Baker, principal chief of the Cherokee Nation, to apologize for the DNA test, said Julie Hubbard, a spokeswoman for the tribe. She called it a "brief and private" conversation.
Ms. Warren's campaign did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
"I understand that she apologized for causing confusion on tribal sovereignty and tribal citizenship and the harm that has resulted," Ms. Hubbard said. "The chief and secretary of state appreciate that she has reaffirmed that she is not a Cherokee Nation citizen or a citizen of any tribal nation."

The apology, which was first reported by The Intercept, is a break from Ms. Warren's previous public stance. For months, Ms. Warren has refused to acknowledge or respond to her critics on the left, focusing instead on responding to Mr. Trump's flurry of more openly divisive attacks, which have included language associated with racist stereotypes.
Native American tribal leaders have repeatedly criticized Mr. Trump's language against Ms. Warren and about Native Americans more generally, but he is yet to apologize or tone down his dismissive rhetoric.
Advisers close to Ms. Warren said she has long expressed private concern that she may have damaged her relationships to Native American groups and her own standing with activists, particularly those who are racial minorities. However, as recently as December, Ms. Warren defended the decision to take a DNA test in an interview with The New York Times.
"I put it out there. It's on the internet for anybody to see," Ms. Warren said in December. "People can make of it what they will. I'm going to continue fighting on the issues that brought me to Washington."
Her reversal has now drawn intense reactions from critics and supporters across the ideological spectrum.
"I'm glad to see that Elizabeth Warren has apologized for the whole DNA test debacle," tweeted Kelly Hayes, a Native American writer who has followed Ms. Warren's claims. "Connecting w members of the Cherokee nation in this way was always the way forward. Also, I hope that the folks who painted myself and others as fringe outliers for discussing this feel foolish."
The reaction was more muted among political operatives, both nationally and in key early voting states like Iowa.
Dave Degner, the Democratic board chair in Tama County, Iowa, said the controversy has had minimal influence, and he has yet to hear any voters bring up the issue. Steve Drahozal, the chair of the Dubuque County Democrats in Iowa, said he was glad Ms. Warren admitted fault.
"I think she took the right step. There's never anything wrong with getting more knowledge and saying you've done something silly and foolish," Mr. Drahozal said. "I think it actually takes a lot of maturity." He added: "For Senator Warren to admit that she did something wrong shows she's thoughtful and she wants to do the right thing."
Brian Fallon, former national press secretary for Hillary Clinton, said he hopes the apology means Ms. Warren can put the issue behind her.
"It seemed from the beginning that the DNA test was an honest attempt to prevent Trump's racist attacks from being indulged in the media, and she has seemed genuinely surprised and contrite regarding the reaction from the tribal community," Mr. Fallon said. "It makes sense to seek to repair that relationship because in every other sense, her successful rollout pretty successfully helped her move beyond this controversy. Now it deserves to be fully behind her."
Ms. Hubbard, the spokeswoman, said the Cherokee Nation believes the call was prompted by a Wednesday opinion column in the Tulsa World by Chuck Hoskin Jr., the secretary of state of the Cherokee Nation. In the column, Mr. Hoskin said Ms. Warren was not a Cherokee citizen, even though her genetic test results showed strong evidence that Ms. Warren has a Native American pedigree "6-10 generations ago."
Ms. Warren's test did not take into account that, for most Native Americans, culture and kinship is what creates tribal membership -- not blood, he said.
"This concept of family is key to understanding why citizenship matters," Mr. Hoskin wrote. "That is why it offends us when some of our national leaders seek to ascribe inappropriately membership or citizenship to themselves. They would be welcome to our table as friends, but claiming to be family to gain a spot at the table is unwelcome."

President Says He's Not the Target, but It's Not That Simple

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- President Trump's assertion that a senior law enforcement official privately gave assurances that he is not under scrutiny in the investigations shadowing him partly served as a defense strategy but also raised new questions about how the Justice Department is conducting the inquiries.
Mr. Trump said in an interview on Thursday with The New York Times that the deputy attorney general, Rod J. Rosenstein, has told him that he was not a target of the special counsel investigation into Russia's election interference and whether any Trump associates conspired with it. "Rod told me I'm not a target of the investigation," he said. The president also said that Mr. Rosenstein reiterated the statement to his personal lawyers "a number of times," but did not say when.
Questions about how law enforcement officials are navigating the inquiry have hung over the Justice Department since a separate investigation came into view in April, when F.B.I. agents raided the office, home and hotel room of Mr. Trump's former longtime lawyer and fixer, Michael D. Cohen. The raids prompted Mr. Trump to increase his attacks on the Justice Department, raising fears among Democrats that he might shut down that inquiry or the one by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III.
But Mr. Rosenstein told the president shortly after the raid that he was not a target in either investigation, according to a Bloomberg News report citing unnamed people familiar with the matter, which prompted speculation that Mr. Rosenstein was trying to placate the president to allow the investigations to continue. People close to Mr. Trump's legal team confirmed that account.
Spokespeople for the Justice Department, the United States attorney in Manhattan and the special counsel all declined to comment on Friday on Mr. Trump's statements.
What do we know about Trump's status in the investigations?
Mr. Trump was considered a subject in the Cohen inquiry, according to court filings. A subject is someone whose conduct is "within the scope of the grand jury's investigation," according to the United States attorneys' manual, the guidebook for federal prosecutors. It does not mean that the person is suspected of breaking the law, but that prosecutors want to learn more to determine whether a crime has been committed.
In a December sentencing memo, prosecutors said that Mr. Cohen made hush payments to women who claimed to have had affairs with the president "at the direction of" Mr. Trump, whom they referred to as "Individual 1."
Prosecutors sometimes tell people involved in an investigation, like when they are being interviewed, that they are neither a subject nor a target -- a more serious designation that means prosecutors have gathered substantial evidence that the person committed a crime.
But prosecutors are not supposed to tell people that they are not the targets or subjects of an investigation if indeed they are. Whether or not someone falls into these categories "is not fixed," said Matthew Axelrod, a former Justice Department official and a lawyer at Linklaters. "People can move between them as an investigation proceeds and evidence develops."
That suggests a few possibilities about what Mr. Rosenstein said. Mr. Trump and his lawyers could have misinterpreted or misrepresented Mr. Rosenstein's comments. The president could have also become a subject in the Cohen inquiry after Mr. Rosenstein made his reassurances to Mr. Trump and his lawyers, and they could be operating off outdated information.
What did we learn about how Trump views the investigations?
Mr. Trump has seemed at times consumed with the investigations, attacking them for years on Twitter and deriding the Russia inquiry as a "witch hunt." He pressed James B. Comey when he was the F.B.I. director to publicly say he was not a target in an investigation.
In early 2018, Mr. Mueller's office told Mr. Trump that he was not a target in the investigation, according to a person close to the president's legal team.
If Mr. Rosenstein, whose office has overseen the Russia and Cohen investigations, also privately told the president as much, it would have bolstered Mr. Trump's sense that he was being unfairly targeted.
But it may have also helped to prevent Mr. Trump from trying to end the Mueller inquiry, which he has said he could do. And it may have helped Mr. Rosenstein keep his job after it became public in September that he had suggested taping his conversations with Mr. Trump and possibly invoking the 25th Amendment to remove him from office.
What are the implications for Mr. Trump if he is not a target of either investigation?
If Mr. Trump was told that he was neither subject nor target of those investigations, it essentially signaled at the time that he was safe from prosecution and that his conduct was not within the scope of a grand jury investigation.
But those designations can change at any time, and Mr. Trump did not say when Mr. Rosenstein last told his legal team that he was not a target.
There are also several reasons Mr. Trump might not be a target, said Joyce Vance, a former United States attorney in Alabama. The evidence might not be there to show that he crossed the line into activity defined as criminal by law. "He also might not be a target because there is a policy that you can't indict a sitting president," Ms. Vance said.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- President Trump regularly expresses pique over scathing kiss-and-tell books written by former aides and advisers. But he had no beef with "Let Me Finish" by Chris Christie, the former New Jersey governor and his onetime transition director.
"Well, honestly," Mr. Trump said in an interview in the Oval Office this week, "he was very nice to me."
But not nice to his family, it was pointed out, most notably Jared Kushner, his son-in-law and senior adviser, who was eviscerated in the book. "No," Mr. Trump conceded, "but he was unbelievably nice to me, actually."
An 85-minute interview with the president offers plenty of clues for Trumpologists seeking to understand him and the ways of his byzantine court -- who is up and who is down, what he cares about and what he does not, what he knows and what he does not. Intentionally or by happenstance, Mr. Trump sends signals that are then scrutinized, analyzed and even satirized.
Mr. Kushner was not the only person in the president's orbit to meet the underside of a bus during his session with The New York Times on Thursday. Mr. Trump chided aides for not connecting him with the author Bob Woodward before his own book was published. He said his lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, was "wrong" about a Trump project in Moscow and "has been wrong" on other matters.
He went after former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, rewriting the history of their split. While Mr. Mattis resigned in protest of the president's decision to pull out of Syria, Mr. Trump insisted that he pushed the secretary out. "I wasn't happy with the job that he was doing at all," he said. "And I said, 'It's time.' That's why in the letter he wrote, 'You have to have your own choice.' The reason he said that was because I said, 'You're just not my choice."'
In fact, Mr. Mattis showed up at the White House with his resignation letter already written. Mr. Trump initially accepted it and characterized it as a retirement "with distinction," but took offense after seeing reports characterizing the letter as a rebuke and forced Mr. Mattis to leave two months earlier than originally scheduled.
On the other hand, Mr. Trump signaled forgiveness of sorts for Stephen K. Bannon, his onetime chief strategist who was excommunicated from Mr. Trump's camp after talking with another author for a book that savaged the president. "If you've seen him on an interview over the last six months, I think there's nobody that speaks better" about him, Mr. Trump said, adding that the two had not spoken in more than a year.
Also on the positive side of Mr. Trump's ledger was William P. Barr, his nominee for attorney general. Although the president was reported to be unhappy when Mr. Barr at his confirmation hearing described a close relationship with Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, Mr. Trump said the testimony "was totally acceptable to me" and that Mr. Barr will be "a great attorney general."
Perhaps most notably let out of the president's doghouse were the nation's intelligence chiefs, whom he had described just a day earlier as "extremely passive and naïve" people who "should go back to school!" Now, he said, all was fine because they had reassured him that their report to Congress this week that conflicted with his foreign policy had been misinterpreted by the news media.
The media, of course, remains permanently in the presidential doghouse, although Mr. Trump enjoys talking with reporters and bashing them in almost equal proportions. On Thursday, he gave the reporters three times as much time as scheduled, gamely taking on all questions, unrushed, and asked them to call him personally if they had questions. "I came from Jamaica, Queens, Jamaica Estates, and I became president of the United States," he said, beseeching A.G. Sulzberger, the Times publisher, for better coverage. "I'm sort of entitled to a great story from my -- just one -- from my newspaper."
But Mr. Trump's description of his call-on-the-carpet meeting with the intelligence chiefs underscored how the president forms what his former communications director, Anthony Scaramucci, himself an author of a tell-all, once called Mr. Trump's "reality distortion field" where he "curves facts toward himself."
Reporting to Congress earlier in the week, Dan Coats, the director of national intelligence, and his counterparts said that North Korea was unlikely to give up its nuclear weapons, Iran was not currently building a bomb and the Islamic State was not defeated, all conclusions at odds with the president's approach.
In their meeting on Thursday, Mr. Trump said he challenged them on this disconnect. "One of the things they said very strongly, according to -- was that Iran is, essentially, a wonderful place," the president recounted. "And I said, 'It's not a wonderful place, it's a bad place, and they're doing bad things.' And they said, 'We agree.' I said: 'What do you mean you agree? You can't agree.' And they said the testimony was totally mischaracterized."
But it may be that Mr. Trump was the one who mischaracterized it or at least misunderstood it. The intelligence chiefs never said that Iran was a "wonderful place" or anything like it; they simply said there was no evidence of a nuclear program in violation of the agreement it made to give it up. Mr. Trump in effect set up a straw man by overstating their testimony, and they could honestly knock it down without taking back what they actually did say.
If so, it worked. Mr. Trump was happy enough to blame the disparity on the news media via Twitter -- tweets that were actually sent out while he was talking with his Times visitors. He had an aide fetch printouts of the tweets to pass around.
When it was noted that he had been in the room with them when the tweets were posted from his account, he acknowledged, "Well, sometimes I dictate tweets."
In interviews, Mr. Trump can be like an unguided missile; it's never entirely clear where the conversation will head. In defending his approach to the presidency, he summoned the spirits of George Washington, who he said also kept a business while in office, and John F. Kennedy, who appointed his brother as attorney general.
Mr. Trump does not obsess about precision. He suggested that it was excessive for the F.B.I. to deploy a "team of 29 people with AK-27s, or whatever they were using" to arrest his longtime associate, Roger J. Stone Jr. There is no such thing as an AK-27 rifle. Presumably, the self-described Second Amendment champion was confusing it with the AK-47, although the F.B.I. of course does not use Russian-made weapons.
Pinning him down can be a challenge. Mr. Trump was asked if he was the person in Mr. Stone's indictment who directed a campaign official to contact Mr. Stone about damaging information in the possession of WikiLeaks, which was releasing Democratic emails stolen by Russian agents.
"Can I tell you? I didn't see it," he said of the indictment. But then he suggested he was knowledgeable about what was in the document. "I know what was in the indictment -- if you read it, there was no collusion with Russia."
Similarly, referring to Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, he first said, "Rod told me I'm not a target of the investigation." But then he suggested that the assurance had gone to his lawyers. "The lawyers would speak to him a lot about that," he said.
And he said that he did not initially know about a memo that Mr. Barr wrote as a private lawyer criticizing one of Mr. Mueller's lines of inquiry, only becoming aware of it later. "I mean, I read it afterwards," he said. Then he said: "I didn't see the memo. I never read the memo."
Truth be told, he did not read Mr. Christie's book either. (Sorry, governor.) He knew that Mr. Christie wrote nice things about him because his staff summarized it for him. "I don't have time to read it, but I get all -- I have somebody -- boom, boom! They give me quotes, it's like five pages," Mr. Trump said. "That you can read, right? And he was very respectful of me."
And so Mr. Trump would be respectful in return. No matter what Mr. Kushner might think.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Sen. Elizabeth Warren apologized to Cherokee Nation leadership about her DNA test that aimed to prove Native American ancestry, according to media reports.
The apology comes just days before Warren, a Democrat representing Massachusetts, is set to make an announcement about whether she will run for president in 2020.
Warren, who announced an exploratory committee for president on New Year's Eve, has been touring around the nation ahead of her expected announcement to join the growing pool of Democrats who aim to challenge President Donald Trump for the White House. But the issue of her ancestry has come up again and again, something that is sure to dog her campaign.
Before voicing her presidential aspirations, Warren released the results of a DNA test, hoping to quell the questions about her ancestry. The test showed she had distance Native American heritage but led to fierce criticism by tribal leaders and backlash that has clouded her first few months of campaigning.

More: Sen. Elizabeth Warren forms exploratory committee for 2020 presidential run
The Intercept and New York Times reported that Warren privately reached out to Cherokee Nation leadership and apologized for the test and any harm it may have caused.
"Senator Warren has reached out to us and has apologized to the tribe," Cherokee Nation spokeswoman Julie Hubbard told The Intercept. "We are encouraged by this dialogue and understanding that being a Cherokee Nation tribal citizen is rooted in centuries of culture and laws not through DNA tests. We are encouraged by her action and hope that the slurs and mockery of tribal citizens and Indian history and heritage will now come to an end. "
Warren released results from the DNA test in October, which showed "strong evidence" of Native American ancestry, partially in response to criticism from Republicans, including President Donald Trump who nicknamed her "Pocahontas. "
Conservatives have attacked Warren for claiming Cherokee heritage in order to gain favor for jobs that helped boost her career, something her former employers have said did not play a role in the hiring process.
Last month, Warren addressed the test when taking questions from supporters at a rally in Iowa.
"Why did you undergo the DNA testing and give Donald Trump more fodder to be a bully?" an audience member asked the Democrat.
Warren said the test wasn't meant to show any claim to a tribe and said she understood and respected the difference between ancestry and tribal citizenship. But, she said after all the attacks, she merely just wanted to "put it all out there. "
"I'm glad you asked that question. I genuinely am and I'm glad for us to have a chance to talk about it," Warren started out in her response. "I am not a person of color. I am not a citizen of a tribe. Tribal citizenship is very different from ancestry. "
Warren went on explaining that when she ran for public office for the first time in 2012, Republicans "honed in on this part of my history" and made a lot of "racial slurs. "
"So my decision was, I'm just going to put it all out there," Warren said of her decision to release the results of the DNA test.
"I can't stop Donald Trump from what he's going to do. I can't stop him from hurling racial insults," Warren said. "But what I can do is I can be in this fight for all of our families. "

Texto completo: "The Lego Movie" is on TBS. And Jake Gyllenhaal plays a deep-pocketed art critic in the new Netflix thriller "Velvet Buzzsaw."
What's on TV
THE LEGO MOVIE 9 p.m. on TBS. As they often do in the minds of the young, Lego characters come to life in Phil Lord and Christopher Miller's animated feature, which centers on an Everyman made of Lego bricks and voiced by Chris Pratt. That Everyman is Emmet Brickowski, a construction worker in a Lego city who is sucked into a world-saving mission: stopping an evil businessman (voiced by Will Ferrell) intent on gluing the Legos in place. Both creativity and life itself are on the line. In his review for The New York Times, A. O. Scott wrote that the filmmakers (who previously directed "Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs") create an environment that "hums with wit and imagination." But the story, Scott wrote, is a "busy, slapdash contraption designed above all to satisfy the imperatives of big-budget family entertainment."
What's Streaming
VELVET BUZZSAW (2018) Stream on Netflix. As if the contemporary art world weren't scary enough, the director Dan Gilroy's lampooning of it imagines a world in which paintings come alive and take life away. Jake Gyllenhaal is the deep-pocketed art critic Morf Vendewalt and Rene Russo plays a powerful dealer in what begins as a somewhat straightforward satire. The movie then transitions into a thriller after Morf is asked by his lover (Zawe Ashton) to be the biographer of a mysterious artist who, among other grotesque things, painted with his own blood. Then the art slays people, for real.
GENERATION WEALTH (2018) Stream on Amazon; rent on Amazon, Google Play, Vudu and YouTube. Gold, diamonds, cigars, exotic pelts and cars, Champagne -- these are a few of the things that pour out of Lauren Greenfield's documentary on American wealth, which Jeannette Catsoulis, in her review for The Times, called a "crammed compendium of capitalist excesses and toxic materialism." A follow-up to Greenfield's 2012 documentary, "The Queen of Versailles," the movie looks at upper-crust figures like a billionaire couple and a porn star, and serves dual roles as both a spectacle and a piece of social criticism.
BAD REPUTATION (2018) Stream on Hulu; rent on Amazon, Google Play, Vudu and YouTube. "For me, it was all in, completely," the rock star Joan Jett told The Times last year. "And I think I knew that young. I didn't have a Plan B." Jett's trailblazing rise and storied career is detailed in this feature-length documentary, which cuts between interviews with Jett, interviews with fellow rockers like Debbie Harry and Iggy Pop, and archival footage. The movie also focuses on Jett as a feminist, who defied the boys' clubs of musicians and music critics through sheer force of will. "I didn't think it would be such a big deal for a girl to play rock 'n' roll," Jett says. What sandwiches that quote is about 90 minutes of proof that it was.

Texto completo: An unprecedented field of candidates is gathering for the Democratic presidential nomination, which reflects a group varying in diversity.
Hillary walked so they could run
By Carl Golden
Convinced that President Donald Trump is seriously vulnerable, upwards of two dozen people have either announced candidacies or are seriously contemplating a run at the 2020 nomination. Among that field are five Democratic women — four sitting U. S. senators and a member of the House.
Sens. Kamala Harris of California, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Kirsten Gillibrand of New York are committed to running, while Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota is in the "I'm thinking about it" stage. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii is an announced candidate.
The challenge for these female candidates is to stand out from the crowd, draw attention, and mount a credible campaign to persuade the donor class to view each as a compelling candidate with a legitimate chance of winning. Their success rests also on where the national Democratic Party finally settles on the ideological spectrum.
Talker: Political correctness culture has gone too far, but blackface is never OK

The party has been driven further to the left by a vocal band of newcomers in the House who believe that militant progressivism represents the path to victory — Medicare for All, free college education, government-guaranteed employment, abolition of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, increased taxes on wealthy individuals and corporations, etc.
While such an agenda will most assuredly draw a sharp contrast with the Trump presidency, it is by no means certain it will capture the imagination of the nation. The socialism upon which it rests has long been anathema to Americans, a rejection of the traditional values of individual freedom, personal responsibility and self-initiative.
The primary contests and candidates' debates will reveal how far left the party will tilt and whether the American people can be convinced that such an ideological shift represents progress rather than a threat.
The unfavorable view of Trump held by a significant majority of the country could well assist Democrats in their message of change — even radical change. Democrats will bank on discontent with an administration riven by chaos and headed by a president who often seems to have slipped his moorings to reality.
Abrupt, contradictory shifts in policy, combined with a temperamental chief executive waging running combat with the news media in the midst of an ongoing investigation of his campaign, all work to Democrats' benefit in 2020.
It would, however, be a serious strategic error to rely heavily on antipathy toward Trump as the core of the campaign — a lesson learned the hard way by Hillary Clinton. Underestimating Trump, as the Clinton campaign discovered, is risky.
As the first woman to secure a major party presidential nomination, Clinton opened the path for women to compete on an equal footing with their male counterparts. It was no small achievement and will forever be viewed as a seminal moment in American politics, her subsequent badly flawed campaign and loss to Trump notwithstanding.
Any doubts about whether the country is prepared to accept a woman as president have been put to rest. Clinton, after all, won the popular vote rather handily. Intellect, insight and ability have replaced gender as the defining elements in choosing a president.
Carl Golden is a senior contributing analyst with the William J. Hughes Center for Public Policy at Stockton University. This column first appeared in The Asbury Park (New Jersey) Press.
What others are saying
Michelle Goldberg, The New York Times: "Plenty of women understood intuitively that a misogynist backlash helped Donald Trump win his Electoral College victory. It's why they poured into the streets the day after he was inaugurated, and why they’ve led the resistance ever since. It's why there's a record gender divide in voting patterns and a record number of Democratic women in the new Congress. And it's why it's both thrilling and slightly terrifying that the Democratic presidential field is going to have at least three strong, viable female contenders. "
Lara M. Brown, The Hill: "What's worse than the implicit patriarchal views of the presidency that often underlie the decisions of the two major political parties is that the three women who have been on presidential tickets also have been blamed for the losses. As I explained in late December 2014, when imploring Hillary Clinton not to run for president, the historical 'fundamentals' were not on the side of the Democrats in 1984 or the Republicans in 2008. . . . In short, if ever there were a time for a woman to win the Democratic nomination and oust an embattled incumbent president, 2020 looks to be about as good as this type of nomination and election can get. "
Cal Thomas, Tribune Content Agency: "The major media have gone gaga over the number of women newly elected to Congress and those announcing their run for the White House in 2020, with more female candidates likely to follow suit. But media bias — one of many — is revealed in their focus on mostly liberal women with barely a mention, if they are mentioned at all, of women who are conservative. . . . Why do major media outlets trumpet the causes of women, gays, African-Americans, Hispanics and other groups who are liberal? Why do the ideas of conservative women never seem to receive that same level of attention? If you have to ask the question, you haven't been paying attention. "
What our readers are saying
The first thing the Democrats have to do is figure out which minority group will get the highest priority. That fight should be fun to watch!
— Jim Reid
Kamala Harris, Cory Booker, Julian Castro, Amy Klobuchar — this is what America looks like. The Democratic Party represents the expanding and diversified America. The Republican Party represents the shrinking white male America. Republicans simply cannot behave honorably or properly represent the United States in the 21st century; they could barely do it in the 20th. It truly is time for the inaptly named Grand Old Party to fold its tent.
— Jeanne Nelson
If the candidate pool gets too large, that will mean President Donald Trump will win again for sure. Democrats have to wise up.
— Marie Reddy
One way to stand out among the large pool of candidates bidding for the presidency in 2020 is to have a clean past. Also, they shouldn't waste their time bashing their opponents, and actually have a plan to solve the important issues.
— Irene Whiteman

Pitts: Three stories and a letter

Texto completo: The stories all made recent headlines. The first was about the state of Florida posthumously pardoning the Groveland Four, a group of African-American men who suffered torture, prison and murder after being falsely accused of raping a white woman in 1949.
The second concerns broad Republican condemnation of one of their own, Rep. Steve King, for an interview with the New York Times in which he questioned why the terms "white nationalist" and "white supremacist" should be considered offensive.
The third involves a directive - since rescinded - NBC News sent its writers, reporters and anchors about King's words. "Be careful to avoid characterizing (King's) remarks as racist," it said, suggesting that the remarks instead be described as 'what many are calling racist'."
As for the letter: It was written by Martin Luther King Jr. King famously penned the epistle from a jail cell in Birmingham in response to a group of white clergymen, eight moderate, principled men, who had condemned as "unwise and untimely" his demonstrations against segregation in their city.
One passage of King's response seems especially apropos to this moment. In it, he confessed that he had become "gravely disappointed with the white moderate." Too often, he said, they were "more devoted to 'order' than to justice;" and preferred "a negative peace, which is the absence of tension to a positive peace, which is the presence of justice."
Added King: "Shallow understanding from people of good will is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will."
Make no mistake: King well knew that all over the South, liberal white kids were risking their lives for black freedom. He was calling out other white people, often older, more moderate white people like those eight men, for the tepidness and flaccidity of their commitment to racial reconciliation. This was 1963, but as the stories above suggest, that problem endures.
It is possible, for instance, to celebrate that Florida has finally done right by the Groveland Four - and yet, to also be disgusted that it takes 70 years for the state to belatedly admit its crimes and deliver some small measure of delayed "justice."
It is possible to consider the GOP's condemnation of Steve King all well and fine, yet also a little arbitrary and affected given that King has a history of racist rhetoric that passed without his party seeming to much notice or care - and that the GOP itself has a long record of thinly-veiled racism as obvious as the writing on Barack Obama's birth certificate.
It is possible to concede that NBC has an interest in ensuring its people remain disinterested observers of events they report, yet feel that in asking them to refrain from calling obvious racism obvious racism, the network doesn't embody journalistic rigor so much as it does white people's too-frequent refusal to call out such racism even when it's right in front of them.
We may safely assume most NBC executives, Republican lawmakers and Florida officials would say - and probably believe - all the right things if you asked about their commitment to racial justice. Yet given a chance to put force behind that commitment, they failed. In Florida's case, they failed for seven decades.
"The ultimate tragedy," King once said, "is not the oppression and cruelty by the bad people but the silence over that by the good people." He was right.
If you are good, yet silent, maybe you're not really as good as you think.

Texto completo: No lie: Jamie Lee Curtis stopped by the Nevada Museum of Art last week.
The star of "True Lies" and the "Halloween" film franchise flew to Reno from Southern California to visit the museum's Anne Brigman photography exhibition on Thursday, taking museum officials by surprise.
"She was waiting outside at 10 a.m. for the doors to open," said Amanda Horn, senior vice president of communications for the museum. "She just showed up like a regular patron, paid her admission and came inside."
Curtis's impromptu visit was inspired by a review of the exhibition in the New York Times ("A Pioneering Photographer, Bare in the Back Country," Dec. 26), according to Horn.
Curtis, accompanied by a friend, spent about 90 minutes viewing the exhibit with senior curator Anne Wolfe, and purchased books and other merchandise related to the Brigman exhibit.
Brigman is known for her self-portrait nude photography in the Sierra Nevada at the beginning of the 20th century. The Bay Area resident created some of her best-known work at Lake Tahoe, Desolation Wilderness and Donner Pass around the turn of last century, creating ethereal imagery of nature and humanity.
"She was especially drawn to these trees because these trees in the upper elevations, such as junipers, had to struggle to survive, and the idea of struggle was so important to her world view and the idea that we could achieve personal growth in our lives and in our art," Wolfe told the RGJ in October.
Yes, both the museum and the exhibition remained open to the public during Curtis's visit.
"I think it's a testament to how down-to-earth she is," Horn said.

Texto completo: Attorney Anibal Romero said the Trump Organization is a "criminal enterprise" that has hired undocumented immigrants for years.
About a dozen workers at Trump National in Westchester County, including landscapers and housekeepers, were fired earlier this month because they were in the country illegally.
An attorney who represents undocumented immigrants who have worked at President Donald Trump's golf courses in New Jersey and New York said Tuesday that he is seeking deportation protection for his clients so they can share allegations of harassment, abuse and immigration fraud that they said they witnessed and experienced at work.
Anibal Romero, who has a law practice in Newark, and represents 20 undocumented immigrants who say they have worked at the Trump National Golf Clubs in Bedminster, New Jersey, and Briarcliff Manor, New York, said Tuesday that the Trump Organization is a "criminal enterprise" that has hired undocumented immigrants for years. Some of these workers, he said, have been physically abused and threatened with deportation.
"All of them are material witnesses to a federal crime, and any attempt to try and remove them from the United States could possibly be obstruction of justice," he said in a conference call with reporters, saying that he has received calls from other workers of the Trump Organization who live in other parts of the country.
The Trump Organization did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Romero was joined on the conference call by D. Taylor, president of UNITE Here, the hotel and restaurant workers union; and David Leopold, a partner for Ulmer & Berne LLP and a former president of American Immigration Lawyers Association. Romero said that he has met with several lawmakers this week, including New Jersey's Democratic senators, Bob Menendez and Cory Booker, seeking their support for "deferred action."
Menendez met with several undocumented immigrants who worked at Trump properties on Tuesday morning in Washington, according to Steven Sandberg, a spokesman, who added that Menendez supports "congressional oversight" in the matter.
A call to Booker's office was not immediately returned Tuesday.
About a dozen workers at Trump National in Westchester County, including landscapers and housekeepers, were fired earlier this month because they were in the country illegally, according to a report by The Washington Post.
The firings came about a month after The New York Times reported that undocumented immigrants had submitted fraudulent documentation when they were hired to work as housekeepers at Trump National in Bedminster, and that they were kept on the payroll for years even though they said management was aware of their legal status.
Romero, who is calling for congressional, federal and state investigations into the matter, said he has received calls from both the New Jersey Attorney General's Office, which he said asked him for documentation, and the New York Attorney General's Office.
He said he is scheduling a meeting with officials in the New York office.
Leland Moore, spokesman for the New Jersey Attorney General's Office, declined comment, saying that the office does not confirm or deny investigations.
The undocumented immigrants were working at Trump businesses as Trump campaigned on curbing illegal immigration, and more recently as he has pushed for funding for a border wall, setting up a fight with Democrats in Congress that resulted in the longest partial government shutdown in the country's history.
"We have a situation whereby we have a president who has criminalized, demonized, dehumanized and blamed immigrant workers, both as he was running for president and as president," said Taylor, whose union represents more than 275,000 hotel and restaurant workers, a majority of whom are immigrants, people of color and women.
"And at the same time, we have the exact same organization hiring, abusing workers, who he says are responsible for crime in this country, and in fact all they are doing is working hard providing for themselves and their families and trying to have a better life."
Romero and Taylor said that the undocumented workers were not given health insurance or retirement benefits, and that they were paid less than their counterparts who had legal status. Romero said there was no "upward mobility," meaning access to promotions, for his clients.
One woman he represents was demoted from her role as a supervisor when they found out she was undocumented, he said.
"I think it's up to lawmakers now to investigate this as a criminal activity, but also both Republican and Democrats have to step up to and really deal with the immigration issue in a comprehensive way," Taylor said. "What the Trump organization has done is not unique in this country, but what is unique is we have the head of that organization be the president."
One of the women profiled in the Times story, Victorina Morales, spoke on Tuesday during the conference call.
A native of Guatemala, Morales said that she arrived in the United States in 1999 and that she worked for Trump National in Bedminster for five years and had access to his living quarters while he was running for president.
When Trump was elected, she said she was told she would no longer be allowed to work in his residence.
She was later told that she had to resubmit her documentation, including her residency and Social Security cards.
When she first was hired, she had submitted fraudulent documentation.
She said a supervisor helped her get new fraudulent paperwork for $165, and that they took pictures for the green card at the golf course.
Morales previously told The Times that she ended up borrowing $165 from a manager at the resort to pay someone in Plainfield for a new bogus Social Security number and phony green card to replace the ones she had initially submitted for the position.
She said that she has been subjected to verbal abuse several times, and that one supervisor pushed her against the wall three times.

Texto completo: SAN FRANCISCO -- On Jan. 19, Grant Thompson, a 14-year-old in Arizona, made an unexpected discovery: Using FaceTime, Apple's video chatting software, he could eavesdrop on his friend's phone before his friend had even answered the call.
His mother, Michele Thompson, sent a video of the hack to Apple the next day, warning the company of a "major security flaw" that exposed millions of iPhone users to eavesdropping. When she didn't hear from Apple Support, she exhausted every other avenue she could, including emailing and faxing Apple's security team, and posting to Twitter and Facebook. On Friday, Apple's product security team encouraged Ms. Thompson, a lawyer, to set up a developer account to send a formal bug report.
But it wasn't until Monday, more than a week after Ms. Thompson first notified Apple of the problem, that Apple raced to disable Group FaceTime and said it was working on a fix. The company reacted after a separate developer reported the FaceTime flaw and it was written about on the Apple fan site 9to5mac.com, in an article that went viral.
The bug, and Apple's slow response to patching it, have renewed concerns about the company's commitment to security, even though it regularly advertises its bug reward program and boasts about the safety of its products. Hours before Apple's statement addressing the bug Monday, Tim Cook, the company's chief executive, tweeted that "we all must insist on action and reform for vital privacy protections."
The FaceTime problem has already been branded "FacePalm" by security researchers, who say Apple's security team should have known better. Rarely is there a software flaw that grants such high-level remote access and is so easy to manipulate: By adding a second person to a group FaceTime call, you can capture the audio and video of the first person called before that person answers the phone, or even if the person never answers.
"If these kinds of bugs are slipping through," said Patrick Wardle, the co-founder of Digita Security, which focuses on Apple-related security, "you have to wonder if there are other problematic bugs that other hackers are exploiting that should have been caught."
[Read how to disable FaceTime to avoid the eavesdropping bug.]
On Monday, Apple said it was aware of the issue and had "identified a fix that will be released in a software update later this week."
But the company has not addressed how the flaw passed through quality assurance, why it was so slow to respond to Ms. Thompson's urgent warnings, or whether it intends to reward the teenager whose mother raced to alert the company to the bug in the first place.
A bug this easy to exploit is every company's worst security nightmare and every spy agency, cybercriminal and stalker's dream. In emails to Apple's product security team, Ms. Thompson noted that she and her son were just everyday citizens who believed they had uncovered a flaw that could undermine national security.
"My fear is that this flaw could be used for nefarious purposes," she wrote in a letter provided to The New York Times. "Although this certainly raises privacy and security issues for private individuals, there is the potential that this could impact national security if, for example, government members were to fall victim to this eavesdropping flaw."
Unknown to Ms. Thompson, there is a healthy market for bugs and the code to weaponize them, which allow governments, defense contractors and cybercriminals to invisibly spy on people's devices without their knowledge, capturing everything from their locations to information caught on their microphones and cameras. The FaceTime flaw, and other Apple bugs, can fetch tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars, from dozens of brokers. Those brokers then sell those bugs for ever higher sums to governments and intelligence and law enforcement agencies around the world. On the seedier side of the spectrum are brokers who will sell these tools on the dark web to the highest bidder.
The only catch is that hackers must promise never to disclose the flaw to the vendor for patching, so that buyers can keep their access.
The market for Apple flaws has soared in the post-Edward Snowden era as technology makers include more security, like end-to-end encryption, to thwart would-be spies. This month, Zerodium, a well-known broker and security firm, raised its reward for an Apple iOS bug to $2 million.
In part to compete in that market, and reward those who do right by the company by notifying it of potentially lucrative bugs, Apple announced its own bounty program in 2016 -- the last of the Silicon Valley companies to do so.
At a hacker conference that year in Las Vegas, Apple made a surprise announcement: It said it would start paying rewards as high as $200,000 to hackers who responsibly turned over crucial flaws in its products. But the bounty program has been slow going, in part, hackers say, because they can make multiples of that bounty on the black market, and because Apple has taken its time rewarding them for reporting problems.
The FacePalm bug is a particularly egregious case, researchers say, not just because it was discovered by a teenager simply trying to use his phone, but because it allowed full microphone and video access.
"This is a bug that Apple's Q&A should have caught," Mr. Wardle said. "And where there's smoke, there's almost always fire."
Bug brokers say FacePalm, while impressive, would not have brought a top price because it leaves a record of the attack. The flaw works only if you FaceTime the person you want to capture audio and video for, notifying your target of the call.
Bugs that fetch $2 million or $3 million on the black market leave no trace, work more than 99.5 percent of the time and work instantaneously, said Adriel Desautels, the chief executive of Netragard, a company that helps firms protect their software.
In this case, Mr. Desautels said, FacePalm is not as dangerous as a flaw that can covertly track someone's location, turn on that person's camera and capture video without a trace.
But, he added, "it's pretty good for a high schooler."

Texto completo: The great American journalist, memoirist, and ironist, Russell Baker has passed on at the fine age of 93. Though he did many different things, including writing a play (because he said he was tired of working alone) and hosting Masterpiece Theater, he was best known as the humor columnist for the New York Times.

That he was never replaced suggests two things: That the Times ceased to see the value of humor and that Mr. Baker was irreplaceable. The latter contention is certainly true.

Humor is incredibly difficult to write, and almost no one can do it. Mr. Baker made it look easy but repeatedly assured us it was not. His style was simply to document some sliver of our times (like the fact that Richard Nixon had only one friend or the truth that aspirin bottles are most difficult to open for those who need the aspirin most desperately) and hope that, with the slightest of turns by him, the absurdity of our common plight would be made plain.

What made Mr. Baker great was the emotion beneath his stoicism and sophistication. He was really very angry about humanity. And he was really very hurt by life. Now and then, toward the end of his Times tenure, he dropped all pretense of humor and let loose with a rant and a rave. He said that this was how he knew it was time to quit. But those rare columns were gems.

His memoir about being raised in relative poverty in the South, Growing Up, is masterpiece of storytelling and prose style. He wrote in that book: The only thing I was fit for was to be a writer, and this notion rested solely on my suspicion that I would never be fit for real work, and that writing didn't require any. He also said that he knew he was an essayist and not a reporter after walking to lunch with the late, great James Reston one day. Mr. Reston saw a fire truck and wondered where's the fire? Mr. Baker said he wondered what he might have for lunch, and where.

Russell Baker was really a conservative, but not the kind many people would understand these these days. If he wrote any bad sentences in his life, they were few. We know he wrote many sublime ones. This one is illustrative of both his values and his style: We all come from the past, and children ought to know what it was that went into their making, to know that life is a braided cord of humanity stretching up from time long gone, and that it cannot be defined by the span of a single journey from diaper to shroud.

LAUSD teachers should exercise their Janus rights, not follow their union off a fiscal cliff

Texto completo: Despite the recent settlement of the Los Angeles teachers strike, mostly in the teacher union’s favor, the deal largely ignores the shaky financial realities of the school district. While the union crows about its apparent victory, the potential fiscal disaster should make teachers consider leaving the union, not rallying around it.
In addition to a 6 percent raise for teachers, the settlement deal includes more staff at schools and a cap on class sizes. Yet, the district’s finances mean that the deal is built on quicksand.
As the New York Times pointed out, “the deal essentially punted on the question of how the district would come up with the $403 million to pay for the additional staff members.”
Further, the district can only afford the deal if it can pass a local parcel tax in 2020 and receive increased state funding from Sacramento.
These glaring financial questions clash with the district’s current bottom line.
For example, state law requires the district to maintain a minimum 1 percent budget reserve, and the district has a structural deficit, spending more than it takes in.
That structural deficit will soon end up causing the district to dip below the state-mandated 1 percent minimum.
Los Angeles County Office of Education superintendent Debra Duardo recently told the education group Speak Up, “it’s gotten to the point where [the district] can’t show us that they can maintain a 1 percent reserve in their third year out.”
The County estimates that by 2021-22, “the district will be bankrupt.”
Duardo points out, “Especially at a district as large as LAUSD, if they were to go insolvent, then they would be in really big trouble.”
What kind of trouble? For teachers, here is the chilling warning.
The district, says Duardo, “would actually run out of the cash they need to pay their teachers and all of their salaries.”
Duardo explains that a budget reserve is a one-time pot of cash, and “that’s not money you [will] have [again in the future].”
In response to a question about the district giving in to the union’s demands, Duardo is clear about the ramifications: “The law is set up where if they were to show us in their budget that they don’t have enough money to maintain that reserve, and even go further into the negative — which would concern us that they may be at risk of becoming insolvent — then the next step would be for us to assign a fiscal advisor.”
The kicker: “And a fiscal advisor has stay-and-rescind authority, which means that if there are decisions being made that put the district at risk of becoming insolvent, then we could override decisions that the board is making.”
The union claims that the district is not deficit spending, but Duardo points to the simple fiscal fact that the district’s reserve is plunging, so if there were no deficit spending “we wouldn’t see this reserve dwindling down to below 1 percent.”
The new settlement deal, therefore, may be a Pyrrhic victory for teachers that could cause harm to them and their students.
Instead of blindly following their union, teachers should consider taking advantage of their new rights under the Supreme Court’s Janus decision, which held that public employees cannot be forced to pay dues or fees to unions.
Justice Samuel Alito, who authored the Janus majority opinion, wrote that it is an unconstitutional infringement on the rights of public employees to require them “to provide financial support for a union that ‘takes many positions during collective bargaining that have powerful political and civic consequences.’”
L.A. teachers should make use of their Janus rights and walk away from the union, not walk with it over a cliff.

Texto completo: Despite the recent settlement of the Los Angeles teachers strike, mostly in the teacher union’s favor, the deal largely ignores the shaky financial realities of the school district. While the union crows about its apparent victory, the potential fiscal disaster should make teachers consider leaving the union, not rallying around it.
In addition to a 6 percent raise for teachers, the settlement deal includes more staff at schools and a cap on class sizes. Yet, the district’s finances mean that the deal is built on quicksand.
As the New York Times pointed out, “the deal essentially punted on the question of how the district would come up with the $403 million to pay for the additional staff members.”
Further, the district can only afford the deal if it can pass a local parcel tax in 2020 and receive increased state funding from Sacramento.
These glaring financial questions clash with the district’s current bottom line.
For example, state law requires the district to maintain a minimum 1 percent budget reserve, and the district has a structural deficit, spending more than it takes in.
That structural deficit will soon end up causing the district to dip below the state-mandated 1 percent minimum.
Los Angeles County Office of Education superintendent Debra Duardo recently told the education group Speak Up, “it’s gotten to the point where [the district] can’t show us that they can maintain a 1 percent reserve in their third year out.”
The County estimates that by 2021-22, “the district will be bankrupt.”
Duardo points out, “Especially at a district as large as LAUSD, if they were to go insolvent, then they would be in really big trouble.”
What kind of trouble? For teachers, here is the chilling warning.
The district, says Duardo, “would actually run out of the cash they need to pay their teachers and all of their salaries.”
Duardo explains that a budget reserve is a one-time pot of cash, and “that’s not money you [will] have [again in the future].”
In response to a question about the district giving in to the union’s demands, Duardo is clear about the ramifications: “The law is set up where if they were to show us in their budget that they don’t have enough money to maintain that reserve, and even go further into the negative — which would concern us that they may be at risk of becoming insolvent — then the next step would be for us to assign a fiscal advisor.”
The kicker: “And a fiscal advisor has stay-and-rescind authority, which means that if there are decisions being made that put the district at risk of becoming insolvent, then we could override decisions that the board is making.”
The union claims that the district is not deficit spending, but Duardo points to the simple fiscal fact that the district’s reserve is plunging, so if there were no deficit spending “we wouldn’t see this reserve dwindling down to below 1 percent.”
The new settlement deal, therefore, may be a Pyrrhic victory for teachers that could cause harm to them and their students.
Instead of blindly following their union, teachers should consider taking advantage of their new rights under the Supreme Court’s Janus decision, which held that public employees cannot be forced to pay dues or fees to unions.
Justice Samuel Alito, who authored the Janus majority opinion, wrote that it is an unconstitutional infringement on the rights of public employees to require them “to provide financial support for a union that ‘takes many positions during collective bargaining that have powerful political and civic consequences.’”
L.A. teachers should make use of their Janus rights and walk away from the union, not walk with it over a cliff.

Texto completo: KABUL, Afghanistan - U.S. and Taliban officials have inched closer to an agreement that could meet a key Taliban demand for U.S. troop withdrawals, prompting Afghan President Ashraf Ghani to call on the insurgents Monday to "begin serious talks" with his government and reach a "speedy peace."
Ghani's government has been excluded from the talks until now because the insurgents view it as an American puppet. But Ghani called U.S.-Taliban talks "part of our peace" and warned that a deal without Afghan involvement could lead to the kind of "catastrophic" civil strife that followed the Soviet troop withdrawal from Afghanistan in 1989.
During six days of talks in Qatar last week, Taliban and U.S. representatives outlined but did not formally agree on a broad plan in which U.S. troops would leave the country in exchange for the insurgents pledging to ensure that Afghan territory would not be used by them or other Islamist militant groups to harm American interests.
U.S. talks with the Taliban are aimed at ending more than 17 years of American involvement in Afghanistan's four decades of almost continuous warfare.
Ghani, in a televised speech from his palace Monday afternoon, assured Afghans that he would accept no deal that undermines their rights and the nation's unity. He spoke after meeting with Zalmay Khalilzad, the Trump administration's special envoy for Afghan peace, about progress in Qatar.
Khalilzad told the New York Times on Monday that U.S. and Taliban officials have agreed in principle on two key elements of an eventual deal - that the insurgents would guarantee that Afghan territory would not be used as a platform for terrorism and that U.S. troops would ultimately withdraw in return for further concessions. But he said a U.S. troop pullout still hinges on the Taliban's acceptance of a cease-fire and direct talks with Kabul on domestic issues as part of a full-fledged peace accord.
Ghani, who met with Khalilzad late Sunday in Kabul, told Afghans in his speech Monday that no agreements would be concluded without the government's full participation.
"Our commitment is to provide peace and to prevent any possible disaster," Ghani said. "There are values that are not disputable, such as national unity, national sovereignty and territorial integrity."
He called on the Taliban to "accept the call of the people" and begin "serious talks" with his government, despite the insurgents' renewed insistence on no direct talks until an agreement is reached on the "withdrawal of foreign forces" from Afghanistan.
Khalilzad, President Donald Trump's special envoy for Afghan peace, flew to Kabul on Sunday from Doha, the Qatari capital, to report on his talks with Taliban representatives.
Khalilzad said Saturday in a series of tweets that the latest talks had been "more productive" than in the past and had made "significant progress on vital issues," but he said there were still "a number of issues to work out." He said that "nothing is agreed until every thing is agreed, and every thing must include intra-Afghan dialogue and comprehensive ceasefire."
Taliban officials, for their part, issued a statement late Saturday saying that progress had been made but that further talks were needed to deal with "unsolved matters." The statement added pointedly that Taliban policy was made "very clear" during the talks: "Until the issue of withdrawal of foreign forces from Afghanistan is agreed upon, progress in other issues is impossible."
In a tweet Monday, Khalilzad said he had briefed Ghani on the "progress we have made" in Doha. "Peace is America's highest priority in Afghanistan, a goal we believe all Afghans share," he added. Talks between the two sides are expected to resume next month.
But a statement from Ghani's office Monday said Khalilzad also told the president that "no kind of discussion" was held in Doha about the "structure of the future establishment" in Afghanistan, a reference to the Taliban's demands for a future role in politics and government.
The statement also said Khalilzad told Ghani that his mission was to "facilitate intra-Afghan dialogue" and that any pullout of foreign troops would be conducted "in coordination" with the Afghan government.
The issue of Afghan inclusion in the peace process is especially sensitive for Ghani, who is seeking reelection in a vote slated for July. He has opposed suggestions that an interim government be formed to implement a peace plan, and he has expressed concern that a hasty U.S.-Taliban deal could come at the expense of Afghan democracy and freedoms.
In his televised speech, Ghani recalled the bloodshed that erupted in 1992 after Islamist Afghan militias that had fought the Soviets refused to negotiate under United Nations auspices with Kabul's Moscow-backed government, leading to a devastating civil war.
"I know the probable risks and threats after a peace agreement," Ghani said. "We are committed to restore peace and prevent possible catastrophe and disintegration."
Several Afghan critics on Monday derided Ghani's assertion that his government would be consulted on U.S. troop pullout plans. They noted that President Trump has already said he wants to withdraw thousands of troops and that Khalilzad has been under White House pressure to arrange a deal with the Taliban as fast as possible.
"America does not need our advice or consultation for leaving. It came here for its own interests, and it will leave for its own interests," said Hafiz Mansour, an opposition legislator. "Trump can decide to pull out troops at any moment, and the U.S. is looking for a face-saving approach to do it. But our troops do not have the capacity to defend the country. We will need foreign help for years to come."
Ghani has worked closely with U.S. military officials here since taking office, strongly endorsing a buildup in U.S. training and advising of Afghan forces over the past two years. At an international economic conference last week in Davos, Switzerland, Ghani declared that 45,000 Afghan security forces had died since he took office in 2014, a much higher toll than previously reported.

Texto completo: Stream Gabriel Iglesias's new Netflix special. Or gear up for the Super Bowl with a countdown of memorable ads.
What's Streaming
GABRIEL 'FLUFFY' IGLESIAS: ONE SHOW FITS ALL (2019) stream on Netflix. In this follow-up to his 2016 stand-up special, "I'm Sorry for What I Said When I Was Hungry," Gabriel Iglesias remembers a hazy interview with Snoop Dogg and props up his teenage son as an eligible bachelor. This is set to be a busy year for this actor and comic, who is better known as Fluffy. Iglesias also has a role in the animated movie "UglyDolls," opening this spring; he will star in his own scripted comedy series on Netflix this year; and he plans to tape another performance for the platform in the near future.
SILENT WITNESS on Britbox. This gory procedural, created by a former detective, is the longest-running British crime drama on television. Season 22 lays out five two-part stories and begins with the case of a murdered transgender man and a seemingly related kidnapping that puts the pathologists at the Lyell Center in a tough position. Andrew Knott, Heather Peace and Johann Myers guest star.
PLEASANTVILLE (1998) stream on Hulu; rent on iTunes, Google Play, Vudu or YouTube. Fans of "The Truman Show" may get a kick out of this fantasy, which leaves Hulu on Thursday. Gary Ross's directorial debut concerns the siblings David (Tobey Maguire) and Jennifer (Reese Witherspoon), who fight over a remote control and wind up replacing characters in David's favorite show, "Pleasantville." The black-and-white 1950s sitcom is named after a perfect town with perfect people -- one that starts to lose its glossy veneer once David and Jennifer bring reality into the frame. As residents begin to show their true colors, David learns that his dear fantasy world isn't that different from real life. (William H. Macy, Joan Allen and Jeff Daniels round out the cast.) In her review for The New York Times, Janet Maslin wrote that "much of the interest here is in watching how the black-and-white scenes (filmed on color stock) begin to flower."
RETURNING THE FAVOR stream on Facebook Watch. This feel-good reality show wraps up its third season. The host, Mike Rowe, heads to Pittsburgh to meet Megs Yunn, founder of an organization that creates birthday parties for children in need.

As Hogan weighs 2020, his claims of bipartisanship face scrutiny

Texto completo: Md. governor has had a love-hate relationship with Democrats
Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) is touting his dealings with Democratic lawmakers as a model of bipartisanship, drawing a national spotlight and accolades from Republican dissenters who are seeking a less-polarizing alternative to President Trump.
The governor, who is consulting with aides and national GOP critics of Trump about whether to pursue a White House bid, said at his inauguration this month that he and state Democrats have "put problem-solving ahead of partisanship and compromise ahead of conflict."
But Hogan's first-term record includes cross-party nastiness as well as collaboration. At times, he forged compromises with lawmakers on major issues. In other moments, he was disengaged.
He called political opponents "thugs," barred more than 450 critics from his official Facebook page and sometimes took credit for Democratic legislation he had initially opposed.
Leading Democrats in Annapolis say the governor was easier to work with in the second half of his term, an evolution that could reflect the divisiveness in Washington or his gubernatorial reelection campaign.
"The first two years of the term were more confrontational and hostile," said state Sen. Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City), the vice chair of the Senate Budget and Taxation Committee. "After the 2016 election and the rise of the Trump administration, I suspect the Hogan administration took a hard look at how the next two years would function. . . . I commend him for adjusting his approach."
Hogan spokeswoman Amelia Chasse said Hogan "has worked in a bipartisan manner to deliver real, common-sense solutions that have changed Maryland for the better."
"We don't engage and fight on every one of the thousands of bills proposed each session," Chasse said in a statement. "We let the legislature do their jobs and develop policy through a democratic process, and the governor does his job as the chief executive of the state."
Those close to Hogan say he is unlikely to run for president in 2020 unless Trump is severely weakened or decides not to seek a second term.
But the governor has made clear he wants to be part of the national conversation, denouncing the recent government shutdown as a failure on the part of both Trump and congressional leaders. He says he could help the country return to "something better and more noble than the politics of today."
'Not a career politician'
Hogan campaigned in 2014 on a platform of reversing tax and fee increases enacted by his predecessor, Democrat Martin O'Malley, in the years after the Great Recession. During Hogan's maiden State of the State address
, he chided Democrats over the "floundering" economy and the "exodus of taxpayers fleeing our state."
At the time, House Speaker Michael E. Busch (D-Anne Arundel) said the speech was tantamount to "poking a stick in the eye of the people you need."
Each side accused the other of failing to communicate, leading to bitter fights about the governor's first budget and perennial conflicts over school spending. At one point, Hogan criticized lawmakers for pushing legislation to limit his powers and mockingly compared them to college students on spring break.
"They come here for a few weeks," Hogan said on "The C4 Show" on WBAL-AM Radio. "They start breaking up the furniture and throwing beer bottles off the balcony."
Hogan surprised Democratic lawmakers with unilateral announcements that he would close a scandal-plagued Baltimore jail, lower tolls on state roadways and order public schools to start classes after Labor Day.
In 2016, he lashed out at state teachers union officials who criticized a budget decision involving school funding, calling them "thugs" on his Facebook page.
"There are times when he has been bipartisan, and there are times when he has been extremely partisan," said Del. Eric G. Luedtke (D-Montgomery).
Democratic lawmakers say state government agencies were often little to no help in giving expert testimony or the governor's position on proposed legislation. Hogan aides said the administration has provided advice and counsel on bills that it deems important.
Unlike O'Malley, who testified before legislative committees, Hogan prefers to bring lawmakers into his office to discuss measures, his staff said.
"Governor Hogan is not a career politician," Chasse said. "He doesn't see the need to follow procedural norms."
Hogan originally opposed a ballot question on a constitutional amendment that would require the state to use casino taxes on education. Within weeks, he reversed his position and began calling the proposal the "Hogan lockbox."
He took no position on legislation to provide free community college and did not work to help it pass in the Democratic-majority legislature. But after he signed the bill, he embraced the issue on the campaign trail and announced that if elected he would expand the scholarship program.
"In those instances, we do all the work and he gets the credit," said Del. Joseline Peña-Melnyk (D-Prince George's), the vice chairwoman of the Health and Government Operations Committee.
There were notable exceptions.
Hogan worked closely with Democratic legislative leaders to craft a deal that lowered health insurance premiums for residents affected by the dismantling of the Affordable Care Act. He also collaborated with them to approve dedicated funds for the Washington-area Metro system, address crime in Baltimore and boost school safety after a shooting at Great Mills High School in St. Mary's County.
Sen. Robert A. Zirkin (D-Baltimore County), who chairs the Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee, said Hogan's support for the 2016 Justice Reinvestment Act was crucial in bolstering GOP support for the criminal justice-reform bill.
When lawmakers were deadlocked over specific provisions in the closing days of the legislative session, Christopher Shank, a former Republican lawmaker who had become a top policy aide, negotiated a deal between the House and Senate.
"I've gotten to know [Hogan] politically and on a personal level. . . . He truly wants to work together," said Zirkin, who earlier in 2016 had publicly rebuked the governor and demanded an apology from him for his "spring break" comment.
Senate President Thomas V. Mike Miller (D-Calvert), who considers Hogan a friend and has known him for decades, said the governor has "evolved."
"When he first got elected, he never held public office before and he was very conservative, believing government is the problem, not the answer," Miller said. "He's come around. He's grown."
Spreading a message
Two people who have talked about Hogan's future with him recently and spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss those conversations, said Hogan is not likely to directly challenge Trump in 2020 unless the president is significantly weakened. Trump has already raised more than $100 million for his reelection bid and consolidated support within the Republican National Committee.
Hogan is "very practical and realistic about where things are. . . . He sees what kind of percentages Trump gets in the Republican Party and how influential he is in some of the Southern states," said one of the people, who spoke to Hogan before Trump's poll numbers fell in the final days of the government shutdown.
"I don't think he has one of these burning ambitions to be president," this person said. "He does think that his message, and the Maryland example, is important right now. And he wants to find a way to spread it. Does he have to run for president to do it? Probably not, but maybe."
Hogan, the incoming chair of the National Governors Association, has succeeded in drawing the media spotlight, including columns in the New York Times and The Washington Post and articles in BuzzFeed and Politico.
He plans to meet soon with commentator Bill Kristol and strategist Sarah Longwell, both leading anti-Trump Republicans, Chasse said. And he has told reporters he plans to hold political meetings when he visits Iowa in early March for NGA business, and will likely travel to New Hampshire in coming months.
Kristol has been meeting with Republican donors and potential candidates, showing them polling that suggests Trump may be vulnerable to a primary challenge, despite his high approval ratings among GOP voters.
"A fair number of those approvers are not on board for reelecting Trump, necessarily," Kristol said. "When you say to them, 'Going forward do you think Trump is the right guy to win in 2020?', they get more nervous."
In a recent interview with The Post, Hogan said he was focused on Maryland and "being a bigger part of the discussion."
But he did not rule out a presidential run.
"I don't think you can ever rule anything out," he said. "We don't know what's going to happen over the next year, or two, or six years."

Texto completo: Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan Monday called the ongoing negotiations between the United States and the Taliban “encouraging,” and said they might pave the way for more serious planning for a gradual draw-down of U.S. troops in Afghanistan.

Shanahan made the brief remarks to reporters as welcomed NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg to the Pentagon.
“We might get a chance to talk about that this week,” Shanahan said when questioned whether there was planning underway to reduce the U.S. troop commitment to the NATO-led Operation Resolute Support.

“Hopefully later on this week when we get together we can talk about some of the encouraging conversations that are going on with the Taliban,” Shanahan said.

Zalmay Khalilzad, the U.S. special representative for Afghanistan reconciliation, tweeted over the weekend that six days of talks with Taliban representatives in Qatar “were more productive than they have been in the past,” and that “significant progress” was made on vital issues.

Upon arriving in Kabul, Khalilzad told the New York Times an “agreement in principle” has been reached on the framework of a deal in which Taliban would guarantee Afghan territory is never used by terrorists and bring an end to the 17-year old war.

After briefing the Afghanistan government and other officials on the breakthrough in the talks, Khalilzad tweeted Monday, “Briefed them on the latest round of talks. No one has a monopoly on the diplomacy of peace and all have contributions to make. Good discussions and some new ideas.”

Shanahan said as of today he has not been tasked to draw up plans for the U.S. withdrawal, but that he had been briefed on the outlines of the potential peace accord.

“Really the takeaway right now is it’s encouraging,” Shanahan said, “and we’ll let Secretary [of State Mike] Pompeo and the ambassador [Khalilzad] be the spokespersons for that.

“We are in Afghanistan to create the conditions for a peaceful negotiated solution,” said Stoltenberg. “We will not stay longer than necessary but we will not leave before we have a situation that enables us to leave or reduce the number of troops without jeopardizing the main goal of our presence and that is to prevent Afghanistan from becoming a safe haven for international terrorists once again.”

Texto completo: They say a picture is worth a thousand words. We'll have to make do with 600 or so.
The picture in question - the video, actually - electrified social media over last weekend. In it, a white high school boy wearing a "Make America Great Again cap, confronts an older Native American man who is beating a ceremonial drum and singing a Native song.
The encounter took place on Jan. 18 on the National Mall. The man was there as part of the Indigenous Peoples March. The boy was with a group from Covington Catholic High School in Kentucky that was participating in the "March For Life anti-abortion rally.
The man sings. The boy smirks. Some of his classmates mock the Native man. Someone yells, "Build the wall! And there was, for many of us, something starkly symbolic in all of it, something that spoke of American fracture.
Yes, the story grew more complicated as details emerged over the weekend. It turns out the students had been drawn to the spot by a small group of black protesters - so-called "Black Hebrew Israelites - using their First Amendment rights to curse and insult essentially everyone who was not them, including Catholics, whites, Native Americans and, at one point, a black person who disdained their toxic beliefs.
The students began what they described as a school spirit chant to drown out the black men. Tensions were high. And into this cauldron of ideology and identity stepped Nathan Phillips, a 64-year-old elder of the Omaha people and a Vietnam veteran. His aim in walking through the crowd, he said, was to settle things down. As he told The New York Times, "I stepped in between to pray.
The crowd, he said, parted to let him through. All except for the boy, since identified as Nick Sandmann, a junior. Phillips said the boy blocked him when he moved left. When he moved right, Sandmann did the same.
In a written statement, the boy denied blocking Phillips. "To be honest, he wrote, "I was startled and confused as to why he had approached me. But the boy in that video, smirking, trying not to laugh, is not startled or confused. He looks, rather, entitled and smug.
Indeed, what gave the image its initial, visceral power was the sense that his expression was one we have seen before. It was on the face of an SS man as he cut off a rabbi's beard on a Warsaw street, on the face of an Alabama state trooper waiting at the Edmund Pettus Bridge. Heck, it was on the face of a hulking high school boy as he prepared to dunk a smaller kid's head into the toilet. It was the eternal expression of the bully at the head of a mob.
Now here it was on this boy, using his First Amendment right to wear a hat many of us consider the functional equivalent of a pointy white hood, as he faced down a child of the people who named the Mississippi River and left the first footprints in the virgin soil of the Blue Ridge Mountains. All while someone yelled about building a wall. And if the story has grown more complicated, what hasn't changed is the sense that those images capture a nation at the breaking point.
As it happens, this story unfolded over the weekend we set aside to honor Martin Luther King, the confrontation itself occurring near the spot where he said, "I have a dream. That, of course, was on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, a monument to the president who led this country through a war in which 2 percent of the population - the modern equivalent would be over 66 million people - died fighting over the meaning of freedom.
And Nathan Phillips' prayer? It was for unity, he said.

Scholar from Owensboro warns of war in his latest book

Texto completo: A scholar and historian who was raised in Owensboro and is now widely considered an expert on U.S.-Russian geopolitics, has published his latest book, which warns of an ongoing Cold War that is perhaps even more dangerous than the last.
Stephen F. Cohen, 80, is a professor emeritus at New York and Princeton universities, who, late last year, published "War with Russia: From Putin & Ukraine to Trump & Russiagate." The book puts into context political and military confrontations the U.S. and Russia have been locked in for the last two decades as an evolved form of the Cold War, the outcome of which could be the annihilation of both states.
Proxy confrontations common during the 40-year Cold War have become more physical in Syria, Ukraine and Georgia, he alleges. Yet, without trust and political backing, neither countries' leaders can successfully stand down.
"If you lived through the first Cold War and survived it, you could be very complacent," Cohen said. "You could say, 'OK, it's too bad there's a new Cold War, but we survived that one; we'll survive this one.' One of the themes of the book is that this one's very different and more dangerous and more fraught with hot war. It's partly

generational. My generation tends to shrug: 'New Cold War? Fine, we'll do it again.' But maybe it's going to be a lot worse, and that's a major theme in the book. It's come in the form of Ukraine, Syria, Georgia and Russiagate now."
Cohen spoke with the Messenger-Inquirer this week via phone from his New York City home. He said his experience growing up in Kentucky is partly what led to his interest in Russia. Although his Jewish grandfather immigrated to the U.S. from the Russian Federation, he said he knew very little about his family history there. His father brought the family to Owensboro to open up a store after working for some time as a traveling washing machine salesman. Owensboro, Cohen said, was a better place to settle down and raise the family.
Kentucky's pro-Confederate leanings after the Civil War and the onset of racial segregation were interesting to Cohen, since both the war's leaders, Jefferson Davis and Abraham Lincoln, were born in the Bluegrass State.
"That must have meant that, in Kentucky, there was an alternative path of development," he said. "It wasn't inevitable that Kentucky would become a Confederate, Jim Crow state .... That led me to my first book, which was very successful, a biography of Nikolai Bukharin, who was defeated by (Joseph) Stalin. Since then, I have always been interested in alternatives, and I even have a book called "Soviet Fates and Lost Alternatives: From Stalinism to the New Cold War." In the introduction, I do mention this antecedent of Jefferson Davis and Abraham Lincoln coming from Kentucky, that there were alternatives in Kentucky and why one road was taken and not another. It's the kind of things historians even today will look back and study."
Experiencing racial segregation in Owensboro taught Cohen an important lesson about how understanding oppression can often be influenced by perception. He has expounded on that to better understand the Russian Revolution and the dissolution of the Soviet Union.
"When you're young, you don't think about (racial segregation)," he said. "When I was a little kid growing up, it seemed like the natural state of things to me. The reason I mentioned the Soviet Union is most people there grew up thinking that was just the natural state of things. They had known no other. They had been born into it. Their parents had lived it. Change comes later when something happens and people begin to believe that something's not right, or some alternative appears. That's a question historians like to study. It's certainly the case that all the years I was in Kentucky as a kid, it was a really deep-south town. I lived in the segregated, Jim Crow deep south. It probably wasn't as bad as maybe Mississippi or Alabama, but it was locked in."
In his book, Cohen challenges longstanding views about Russia and its leaders. Since the resignation of Russian President Borris Yeltsin and the succession of then-Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, the political establishment in D.C. has struggled to come to terms with a Russia far more active in international affairs that could put U.S. dominance in certain regions at risk.
That struggle, he said, has materialized in the form of extraordinary abuses of power by U.S. intelligence agencies. The CIA, for example, has "cooked up" evidence pertaining to the now-President Donald Trump campaign and Russia. Asked whether he may be glossing over serious claims of Putin's human-rights violations and intelligence agency's reports on collusion, Cohen said such criticisms are baseless. He was exiled from the Soviet Union in 1982 for his relationship with dissidents there, and he said he prefers to keep an open mind on intelligence reports.
But if the U.S. and Russia truly are on the brink of war, he said, demonizing both Trump and Putin will alienate them from each other and make peace -- like that sought after the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962 -- nearly impossible.
"The political class in Washington doesn't trust Trump, they hate on the Kremlin leader in a way that they never hated communist leaders, so where is the possibility that we would have the peaceful negotiation by the two leaders that we had in Cuba? When you think about that, who's going to negotiate us out? Congress? The New York Times? Who's going to get on the hotline and say, 'Look, Vlad, we're very close to nuclear war. Let's pull back here and I'll pull back there. We'll do this and we'll do that' if they don't have their own countries behind them? Nobody is going to support what Trump does with Russia, even when he does something sensible. I'm not making this up. They call it treason when he does the right thing? What if our fate's in his hands? What are we going to do?"
"War with Russia: From Putin & Ukraine to Trump & Russiagate" is available online and at most major bookstores.

In New Film, Conspiracy Theory About AIDS in South Africa Is Revived

Texto completo: STOCKHOLM -- When South Africa opened its books on the atrocities of the apartheid era in the 1990s, a tantalizing series of faded documents reignited one of the continent's enduring mysteries. The records suggested that a white militia, operating with the support of the C.I.A. and British intelligence, orchestrated the 1961 plane crash that killed the United Nations secretary general, Dag Hammarskjold.
Twenty years later, a team of documentary filmmakers set out to investigate the shadowy militia, known as the South African Institute for Maritime Research, and to determine whether it had really assassinated Mr. Hammarskjold. What they uncovered, if it is to be believed, was an even more shocking allegation.
In the film, "Cold Case Hammarskjold," which debuted Saturday at the Sundance Film Festival, a former militia member claims that his organization used phony vaccinations in the early 1990s to spread H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, in an attempt to wipe out the black population.
"We were at war," said the former militia member, Alexander Jones. "Black people in South Africa were the enemy."
Scientists immediately cast doubt on the claim, which they called medically dubious.
"The probability that they were able to do this is close to zero," said Dr. Salim S. Abdool Karim, the director of Caprisa, an AIDS research center in South Africa. Dr. Karim, a renowned AIDS researcher who was working on the disease in South Africa in the 1990s, said a laboratory alone would have required millions of dollars and an infrastructure on a par with what the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta had at the time.
AIDS experts said the film's claim -- which arose in interviews with the former militia member, who described its activities over decades -- unnecessarily gave currency to conspiracy theories. They warned that the claim could cause serious harm in South Africa, which has one of the world's highest H.I.V. infection rates.
For many years, South African officials questioned established science and pushed herbal remedies for AIDS, even as the disease ravaged their country.
"One dangerous consequence of these allegations is that they have the potential to sow mistrust and suspicion of doctors and the medical establishment, and that they may confuse people about how H.I.V. is transmitted," said Rebecca Hodes, the director of the AIDS and Society Research Unit at the University of Cape Town.
There is no consensus among epidemiologists on why H.I.V. infections are so high in sub-Saharan Africa. That disagreement, coupled with disproportionately high infection rates among blacks, gave rise to conspiracy theories, including that the disease had been created for population control.
Such theories, though widely discredited, have festered in South Africa, where blacks were subjected to atrocities during a half-century of white supremacist rule.
But rarely has anyone professed firsthand knowledge of such an orchestrated campaign to spread H.I.V. Mr. Jones, who is unrelated to the notorious American conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, said he had visited a research facility and was certain that the militia ran its clinics with a singular goal: "to eradicate black people."
There is medical reason to be highly skeptical of Mr. Jones's account. H.I.V. is difficult to isolate, handle and culture in a laboratory. Putting the virus into a solution, keeping it viable and spreading it through injections would be challenging even today.
In the early 1990s, only a handful of laboratories in the world had the ability to conduct such sophisticated H.I.V. experiments, said Dr. Karim, the AIDS researcher.
Though the filmmakers present Mr. Jones as a self-assured whistle-blower, their notes from several interviews they conducted with him before the final taping reflect that he repeatedly denied that his group was involved in an AIDS project.
As the interviews progressed, the filmmakers posed additional questions that introduced details of possible militia activities. Mr. Jones's responses evolved and, by the time he sat for the final interview, he professed firsthand knowledge of people and events that he had previously seemed to first learn about from the filmmakers.
The filmmakers provided the materials to The New York Times, and offered a reporting collaboration. The Times investigated the claims but did not enter into such a partnership. When asked about the discrepancies in Mr. Jones's story, the filmmakers acknowledged that they could not corroborate the account and that the plan Mr. Jones had described might not have been medically possible. They encouraged journalists to investigate further.
"Journalists reporting on it should take care to contextualize the allegations," said one of the filmmakers, the Danish producer Peter Engel, "and to remind readers that, even if proven true, there is no reason to turn away from modern medical clinics, which are regulated in ways which did not exist in the 1980s at the end of the apartheid era."
Such a cautionary note was not included in the version of the film seen by The Times.
The documentary adds new details and raises fresh questions about the death of Mr. Hammarskjold, a Swedish diplomat whose plane crash has never been fully explained. A United Nations panel concluded that there was "persuasive evidence that the aircraft was subjected to some form of attack or threat."
But the AIDS accusations are likely to generate the most attention. And though Mr. Jones's account cannot be corroborated, there is support for the notion that the militia was at least interested in AIDS research. One young woman, Dagmar Feil, was killed in front of her home in 1990. Her mother told the South African authorities that she had been conducting AIDS research for the militia at the time, according to contemporaneous documents.
Much is unknown about the militia, and it is difficult to sort fact from fiction. Its leader, Keith Maxwell, had claimed that it was rooted in British admiralty traditions and traced its lineage to the early 1800s. When the Hammarskjold documents surfaced in the late 1990s, government officials and experts puzzled over what to make of them. Many dismissed them as forgeries or the product of a Soviet disinformation campaign.
Whatever the group was in that era, by the 1980s and early 1990s it appeared to be a mercenary organization. Paramilitary groups and private military organizations were common during the apartheid era, and the group known as Saimar (pronounced "Sy-marr") advertised for military-trained men to serve in unspecified foreign operations.
Mr. Maxwell, who reportedly died in 2006, also ran medical clinics of some kind in South Africa, though he was not a doctor. And he claimed publicly that AIDS would ultimately be good for humanity and would decimate the black population in South Africa.
But his interest in AIDS is far from proof of a successful germ warfare campaign. An eccentric figure who insisted on the title "commodore," Mr. Maxwell's writings were rambling, fantastical affairs.
"He was a bit of a clown, but he took himself quite seriously," said Adrian Hadland, who interviewed Mr. Maxwell in the late 1980s for the satirical magazine The Laughing Stock. Mr. Hadland, now a professor at the University of Stirling in Scotland, cautioned against taking any of Mr. Maxwell's claims at face value. "I would be very careful about putting things on the line for anything to do with this guy," he said.
The film stars and is directed by Mads Brugger, a Danish journalist who posed as a European adventurer and bribed his way around central Africa in the 2012 film "The Ambassador." Some criticized the film and Mr. Brugger as racist, but he said he was playing a role in order to reveal hidden truths. The film critic A.O. Scott, writing in The Times, questioned whether Mr. Brugger was trustworthy.
Like the mystery of Mr. Hammarskjold's death, the story of AIDS conspiracy theories is rooted in Cold War intrigue. It began as Soviet disinformation, with K.G.B. officers planting articles in newspapers saying that the United States military had manufactured the disease, according to Nicoli Nattrass, author of the book "The AIDS Conspiracy."
The false reports quickly made their way to Africa, where South Africans adopted their own versions, often involving the apartheid government. The oppression from the white supremacist government, which did have a biological weapons program, made the AIDS legend believable to many blacks, Ms. Nattrass wrote.
Dr. Hodes cautioned against believing the conclusions of the Hammarskjold documentary. "Each of the components of this outlandish claim should be scrutinized through careful consideration, and verified factually," she said.

If Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Were a Conservative ...

Texto completo: Syndicated Columnist
Washington
If Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., were a conservative, all anyone would be talking about is how uninformed she is. She would be facing trick questions from reporters designed to expose her lack of knowledge, and brutal sketches on Saturday Night Live mocking her intelligence and fitness for office. Instead, SNL fawns over her, while CBS’s Late Show host Stephen Colbert — far from making jokes at her expense — eats ice cream with her and asks how many “f---s” she gives about her critics.
Boy, it’s good to be a socialist.
It’s not that there is a lack of material. This week, for example, Ocasio-Cortez declared that “the world is going to end in 12 years if we don’t address climate change.” She has said that $21 trillion in “Pentagon accounting errors” could pay for most of her massive $32 trillion Medicare-for-all plan — as if there were $21 trillion in unspent tax dollars sitting around in a Pentagon vault. She opined that “just last year we gave the military a $700 billion dollar budget increase, which they didn’t even ask for” — unaware, apparently, that the entire Pentagon budget is $716 billion. She wrongly claimed that Immigration and Customs Enforcement “is required to fill 34,000 beds with detainees every single night and that number has only been increasing since 2009” — when ICE is required only to have that number of beds available and that number has remained flat. She has declared that “unemployment is low because everyone has two jobs” — which is flat untrue. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, there are only 6 million to 7 million Americans with two jobs and 148 million with just one.
Those are examples of ignorance. But apparently she is also dishonest. This week, she told Colbert that she has not been able to open a district office yet to handle constituent casework because of the federal government shutdown. “There’s a lot of things we can’t do as freshman members,” she said. “We can’t properly set up our district offices. We can’t get laptops delivered. We can’t start doing the work that we were elected here to do. … It takes the green stuff. And those workers are furloughed.” That’s wrong. Last September, Congress passed the 2019 Legislative Branch Appropriations bill, which funds congressional salaries and offices for the coming year. Ocasio-Cortez knows this because, unlike furloughed workers, she is getting paid. The New York Times reports that the three other first-term members from New York have managed to open offices in their districts. A more likely explanation is that Ocasio-Cortez is spending her time building her national media profile instead of taking care of the constituents who sent her to Washington in the first place.
So where are the articles bemoaning “The incredible, thuggish stupidity of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez”? Where are the journalists trying to trip her up with questions like “Do you agree with the Bush Doctrine?” to see if she knows what it is? Nowhere to be found. To their credit, the fact-checkers have been on the case. PolitiFact gave her unemployment claim a “Pants on Fire” rating, and she is rapidly accumulating a large cache of Washington Post Pinnochios — so much so that she claims to be the victim of “false equivalency + bias.” Give me a break. She told CBS’s 60 Minutes that “being morally right” is more important than “being precisely, factually ... correct.” Apparently, facts matter less as long as you support Big Government.
But facts are crucial, especially when you are proposing the largest increase in government spending in human history. Vox recently added up the cost of all her proposals — from Medicare-for-all, to free college, guaranteed jobs and the “Green New Deal.” The price tag was $42.5 trillion over the next decade — more than twice the current national debt. Sorry, you can’t pay for that through Pentagon accounting errors.
It is a tremendous testament to America that someone who was working as a bartender in a Mexican restaurant a year ago can throw her hat into the ring, unseat a 10-term member of Congress and be elected to the House of Representatives. It’s what makes this such an exceptional nation. And it is obvious that she has political talent. But that doesn’t excuse her from the responsibilities as a legislator to learn the facts and serve her constituents. Even Whoopi Goldberg, an Ocasio-Cortez supporter, warned her on The View, “I would encourage you to sit still for a minute and learn the job.”
That’s good advice. Once people decide you are ignorant, it’s hard to recover — just ask Sarah Palin or Dan Quayle. Of course, they were conservatives, so the standards are different.

Anonymous Donor Gives $62,000 to Destroy Guns Used in Las Vegas Attack

Texto completo: A San Francisco software executive has donated more than $62,000 to try to ensure that the cache of firearms that was owned by the gunman in the Las Vegas massacre will be destroyed.
In the aftermath of the 2017 shooting, loved ones of the 58 people who lost their lives in the rampage faced a difficult choice over what to do with the 50 guns and accessories that were owned by the gunman, Stephen Paddock. They could possibly sell the weapons to raise money or have the guns destroyed in a symbolic renunciation of violence.
Now the families don't have to worry about making that decision -- the donor, who wishes to remain anonymous, has stepped in to cover the funds. His only condition is that the guns are destroyed.
The collection of firearms and equipment was valued at $62,340 in a recent inventory of Mr. Paddock's nearly $1.4 million estate by a court-appointed special administrator. As Mr. Paddock died without a will, his mother, under Nevada law, became the heir to his assets, which she agreed to give to the families of the dead victims last March.
After reading a New York Times article about the families' gun dilemma that was published earlier this month, the California businessman decided to write a check to the families for $62,500. He contacted a reporter at The Times so that he could get in touch with the lawyer for the special administrator of the estate.
"It was tugging at my heart strings and it seemed like a horrific situation for the families to deal with this choice," he said in an interview. "I wanted to alleviate some of the pain or at least not allow it to get worse."
The executive said that he wants the donation to be anonymous because the focus should be on the families.
"No credit in the face of pain," he said. "This was about heartbreak and wanting to help."
He said he made the donation conditional on the destruction of the firearms -- which range from pistols to high-powered long arms -- to ensure they do not end up back in circulation.
"I think the families would feel better if the weapons are gone," he said.
Alice Denton, the lawyer for the special administrator of the estate, said the F.B.I., which is in possession of the firearms, had given a verbal commitment that it would destroy the weapons if it received a court order to do so. She said that she would seek such an order next month from the Las Vegas judge overseeing the estate case. In the meantime, no action to destroy the guns would be taken.
A spokeswoman for the F.B.I.'s Las Vegas field office said the bureau was unable to comment.
The executive -- who said he favors stronger gun control but does not consider himself "an anti-gun activist" -- said if it turns out that the F.B.I. will not destroy the firearms, he would try to find another way to have it done.
Ms. Denton said that she received the check last week and was delighted about the donor's generosity.
"We are so grateful," she said. "It shows the compassion that total strangers can have for victims of horrendous crimes, and that, in the face of such evil, there are good people."
Mynda Smith, whose sister was killed in the attack, said the donor's gesture and his desire to see the guns destroyed would help relatives like her deal with their sorrow.
"His desire to alleviate any more emotional pain for the families of the 58, and all survivors really, is what makes it a beautiful thing," Ms. Smith said. "Closing this door in this way is the perfect gift for us."
Ms. Denton said the check has been deposited in her trust account and that it would be transferred to the estate once the guns are destroyed.
Nearly half of the guns in question -- 23 rifles and a revolver -- were found in the gunman's upper-floor room at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino, according to the estate inventory.
It was from that perch at the hotel that he opened fire on an outdoor country music festival. Not only were dozens of people slaughtered, hundreds of others were injured in the worst mass shooting in modern American history.
The rest of the gunman's firearms were in his two Nevada homes. At his house in Mesquite, seven rifles, seven shotguns and five handguns were collected. The estate recently sold that property to an Oregon couple for $425,000.
And two shotguns and five handguns were found at the gunman's Reno home, which is still listed on the market for $374,900.
Lawyers for some of the victims have said that distributing the money to only the loved ones of the dead meant that it could have a far greater impact on their lives than if the large number of people hurt in the attack were also beneficiaries.
If the gunman's estate were to be divided up equally, each of the 58 families would receive about $24,000 -- with the firearms accounting for close to $1,100 per family. The estate also includes an investment property worth a little more than $90,000 and bank and brokerage accounts totaling $455,758.
One family, who intends to sue the manufacturers of the guns used in the shooting, would like to see those weapons kept in tact rather than destroyed.
Through a lawyer, the family of Carrie Parsons, who was killed in the attack, has reached out to Ms. Denton.
"What we are saying is 'Please don't destroy these, they are evidence," said one of the family's lawyers, Rick Friedman, who added that he had not yet been able to identify those firearms.
"Destroying guns he did not use, I have no problem with," Mr. Friedman said.
The anonymous executive said that he would not want to stand in the way of a legal action like this.
"If there is a delay in destroying some of the guns for legal reasons, I am O.K. with that," he said. "I just don't want them back on the streets."

Other names on the 2019 list will be familiar to fans of the SPCO’s Liquid Music, the Walker’s Performing Arts series and Icehouse, because the artists have appeared thanks to them: avant-pop musician and performer Helado Negro, multi-instrumentalist and composer Roscoe Mitchell and vocalist and composer Jen Shyu.
Previous Minnesota USA Fellows are Frank Big Bear, Jonathan Muecke, Toni Pierce-Sands and Uri Sands, Ranee Ramaswamy, Mary Ellen Childs, Morgan Thorson, Carlyle Brown, Siah Armajani, Michael Sommers, Dominique Serrand, Sandra Benitez and Susan Power.
Our mighty indie literary publishers
PEN America has announced the finalists for its 2019 Literary Awards, and two Twin Cities publishers have books in the running.
Ada Limón’s “The Carrying: Poems,” published by Milkweed Editions, is up for the $75,000 PEN/Jean Stein Book Award. Graywolf Press is the publisher of three finalists: Jamel Brinkley’s “A Lucky Man,” for the $25,000 PEN/Robert W. Bingham Prize for Debut Short Story Collection; Jenny Xie’s “Eye Level,” for the $5,000 Open Book Award; and Bernardo Atzaga’s “Nevada Days,” translated from the Spanish by Margaret Jull Costa, for the $3,000 Translation Prize.
Books from Milkweed and Graywolf are up for prestigious (but cashless) National Book Critics Circle Awards. Ada Limón’s “The Carrying: Poems” is also a finalist for the NBCC award in poetry. Anna Burns’ “Milkman,” published by Graywolf, won the Man Booker Prize in October; it’s a finalist in fiction. A second Graywolf title on the NBCC list is Diane Seuss’ “Still Life with Two Dead Peacocks and a Girl,” a finalist in poetry.
The PEN winners will be announced Feb. 24, the NBCC’s March 14 in ceremonies in New York City.
The picks
Tonight at the Powderhorn Rec Center: Minneapolis Art Lending Library Winter Lending Event. Swing by, browse over 100 original works of art, and take one home for three months, for free. The Minneapolis Art Lending Library (MALL) collection features mostly work from Twin Cities artists: paintings, drawings, prints, photographs, ceramics, and sculptures. Here’s a video about MALL from TPT. 5-8 p.m. FMI. Free. If you’re a first-timer, be sure to bring proof of your current address. You’ll need to sign a borrower agreement. That’s all.
Tonight at the MCAD Gallery: Artist reception for “Roman Verostko and the Cloud of Unknowing: From Ideas in Mind to Ideas in Code.” Most artists working in generative, algorithmic art came from engineering and computer science backgrounds; Verostko was a Benedictine monk. An emeritus professor at MCAD who taught for 26 years, he’ll be present for this major retrospective of more than 70 original works. A 168-page exhibition catalog will be available. 6-8 p.m. FMI. Free. Closes Feb. 24. A panel discussion on Tuesday, Feb. 19, will feature Verostko, Grant D. Taylor, and Christine Paul in conversation with Northern Lights.mn’s Steve Dietz.
Opens tonight in the Guthrie’s Dowling Studio: “Unexploded Ordnances (UXO).” The first play in a miniseries the Guthrie is calling “Part of Get Used To It: A Celebration of Queer Artistry.” A political satire from New York’s gender-bending Split Britches theater company, it explores aging, anxiety and doomsday theory in a “Dr. Strangelove”-inspired “situation room” setting. About 90 minutes, no intermission. 7:30 p.m. FMI and tickets ($9). Ends Feb. 10.
Tonight through Sunday at the Ordway Concert Hall: Haydn’s Morning, Noon and Evening Symphonies with Jonathan Cohen. SPCO artistic partner, Baroque specialist, keyboardist and cellist Jonathan Cohen will lead the musicians through the first three pieces of music Haydn wrote for the music-loving Hungarian Prince Esterházy. Haydn wanted to impress his new patron and employer, so all three include virtuosic solo lines for various instruments. The prince must have been very impressed; Haydn remained in his employ for nearly 30 years. 8 p.m. Friday and Saturday, 2 p.m. Sunday. FMI and tickets ($12-50, kids and students free).
Opens Saturday at the Ritz: “A Little Night Music.” There’s a lot of excitement swirling around Theater Latté Da’s new production. A half-dozen reasons: 1) Sondheim. 2) Sally Wingert and Mark Benninghofen, together again (remember “Six Degrees of Separation” and “Sweeney Todd”?). 3) This is the one with “Send in the Clowns.” 4) The musical won tons of Tonys. 5) Peter Rothstein directs. 6) It’s a romantic comedy, and we could all use some of that. 7:30 p.m. FMI and tickets ($31-51). Ends March 3.
Monday at Edina Morningside Church: Michael Bazzett. The church’s “Morningside After Dark” winter coffeehouse series presents Milkweed author Bazzett, whose free-verse translation of the Mayan origin epic “The Popol Vuh” is a New York Times Best Poetry Book of 2018 and a World Literature Today notable translation. There’ll be a complimentary Caribou coffee bar and treats. 7:30 p.m. Free.
Tuesday at Minneapolis Central Library: Talk of the Stacks with Matthew Desmond. MacArthur Fellow Desmond won the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Critics Circle Award for his painstakingly researched, eye-opening and heartbreaking “Evicted: Poverty and Profit in the American City,” set in Milwaukee in our neighboring state of Wisconsin. Plan to arrive early; a big crowd is expected. Doors at 6:15, program at 7. Free. First come, first served. Overflow seating with live video feed will be available.

Texto completo: The divided government of 2019 is a mirror image of the divided government of 2011. Back then, Democrats controlled the White House and Senate, while Republicans had recently taken control of the House with a big victory in the 2010 midterms. Today, Republicans control the White House and Senate, while Democrats have recently taken control of the House with a big victory in the 2018 midterms.
It’s the same situation, essentially. But today there is a vastly different public conversation about the balance of power in government. These days, we are often reminded that Congress is a co-equal branch of government, and therefore Speaker Nancy Pelosi stands on an even level with President Trump. Back in 2011, when the two players were Speaker John Boehner and President Barack Obama, there wasn’t as much of that kind of talk.
Now, Democrats have been saying it every day. There was even talk to the effect that Pelosi is now equal to the president. The chief advocate: Pelosi herself. "Asked if she considers herself Mr. Trump’s equal, she replied, ‘The Constitution does,’" The New York Times reported in an article about the speaker.
A Jan. 17 discussion on CNN focused on the speaker’s battle with the president over the government shutdown and State of the Union address. Republican Rep. Michael Turner said of Pelosi, "She needs to come to some recognition that she’s not equal to the president of the United States."
Susan Hennessey, a Brookings Institution scholar, CNN analyst, and editor of the blog Lawfare, blanched. "Pretty wild to hear a member of Congress forcefully argue that congressional leaders are constitutionally inferior to the president," Hennessey tweeted. "James Madison weeps."
But the speaker of the House is not, in fact, equal to the president of the United States. Congress, not the House, is a co-equal branch of government. Actually, more than equal — it is, as Pelosi noted, the first branch of government. But to exert its will, Congress must be united. To overrule the president — and, of course, Congress can even remove the president — Congress must be united.
Pelosi controls just half of Congress. And she only controls the House when she gets 218 members to agree with her. To overrule a presidential veto, she needs 287 members to agree with her. And then the Senate, controlled by Republicans under Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, has to go along.
On the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, the executive branch is the only branch of government headed by a single person. That gives that one person, in this case President Trump, the power of the executive branch. No single person in the other two branches has that power.
The bottom line is the House is one-half of a co-equal branch of government. The system simply was not designed for a head-to-head equal competition — the president versus the speaker. It doesn’t work that way. It’s entirely understandable that Democrats and their allies in the press would want to see Pelosi as equal to the president.
But that doesn’t make it true.

Undeserved 'Vice' Oscar nod comes down to politics; NATIONAL VIEWPOINT

Texto completo: "The film lacks insight, ingenuity and intensity, skimming the surface of history like a drunk guy at a holiday party who read a Wikipedia entry that he really wants to talk to you about right now." - RogerEbert.com
Is "Vice"the worst movie ever nominated for Best Picture?
Calling the 2018 film "Vice"poorly reviewed is like saying the officiating in the Saints/Rams NFC championship was "a bit sub-par." Filmmaker Adam McKay's attempt at political satire based on the life of former Vice President Dick Cheney was panned by both top critics and fans in general, managing a mediocre 64 percent score on Rotten Tomatoes, and an awful 54 percent from the audience.
(Average "Tomatometer" score of last year's nine nominees? 92 percent.)
And yet somehow the movie did manage to score a Best Picture nomination from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, along with highly praised pics like "Roma" and "The Favourite."
So how did "Vice"("a failure on its own terms" - San Francisco Chronicle), a film that did so little to inspire critics ("The film goes off the rails ... the result is a shambles" - New York Times Review of Books) or audiences ("it doesn't help that there's virtually no character development across the 132 minutes of 'Vice'"- Boston Globe) end up on the list of the allegedly eight best movies of 2018?
"Of course it's politics," says Sonny Bunch, film critic for the right-leaning Washington Free Beacon.
Though he disagrees with the contention that it's the worst Best Picture nominee ever ("It's not even the worst this year," Bunch says), he does agree that if the same film at the same level of performance and production were made about, say, Al Gore or Joe Biden, they would not be on the "Best Picture" list.
"Of course not," Bunch says.
It's no surprise that the movie industry is dominated by left-leaning politics. There is no conservative equivalent to the phrase "Hollywood liberal." But is it really the case that politics can thoroughly trump artistry on such a high-profile, audience-centered event as the Oscars?
"For certain Hollywood types, the right politics is a kind of artistic sensibility," says Abe Greenwald, senior editor at Commentary magazine. "'Best Politics' is essentially an unspoken category, and just as important as Best Screenplay or Best Director. Being liberal and attacking conservatives is, among other things, an aesthetic decision."
"Here's Hollywood's problem," says Kyle Smith, critic-at-large for the popular conservative magazine National Review magazine. "They want people to watch the Oscars, but they really really want people to know they're 'woke.' And those two urges often conflict."
From an economic standpoint, this doesn't appear to make sense. The potential audience for movies and TV shows, aka "the American public," is currently divided 25 percent Republican and 34 percent Democrat. As unpopular as President Trump is right now, he still has the support of 40 percent of Americans, or about 130 million potential TV viewers.
From a cultural standpoint, however, picking "Vice"makes perfect sense. One of the features of the Trump era is institutions that at least feigned political neutrality in the past - journalism, the entertainment media, academia, sports - have responded to the Trump presidency by coming out in full #Resist mode.
In Hollywood, industry pros long claimed their only mantra was "Show me the money!" Forget "red vs. blue" - it's all about the green. Today the effect of politics is so powerful that not only are audiences overwhelmed with anti-Trump sentiment from morning chat shows to late-night comics, but politically correct politics mean the Oscars themselves still don't have a host.
While bad movies winning big awards is nothing new ("Dances With Wolves" beat "Goodfellas" for Best Picture in 1990), "Vice"stands out as a film that even its biggest fans admit is flawed.
It's impossible to disconnect "Vice's"awards from its politics. Which in a way makes it the perfect - if not the best - picture of the year.

ANOTHER WEEK, ANOTHER TOWER

Texto completo: Fresh off its success with ONE St. Petersburg, a South Florida developer is planning two more condo towers in the Tampa Bay area  one in downtown St. Petersburg and another on Tampas Bayshore Boulevard.

The Kolter Group has said nothing publicly yet about a 408-foot tower that would rise on what is now a parking lot between the St. Petersburg Hilton hotel and the Northern Trust office building on First Street S. However, it has asked the Federal Aviation Administration to study the towers impact on planes using Albert Whitted Airport just a mile away.

In Tampa, Kolter recently purchased a 1.2-acre site on Bayshore between Howard and DeSoto avenues for what would be a 21-story, 70-unit condominium. The proposal is expected to go before the citys Architectural Review Commission in early February, said attorney Truett Gardner, who represents Kolter.

Kolter, based in West Palm Beach, is making a name for itself in Floridas luxury condo field. It has built or has under construction three towers in South Florida and two in Sarasota, including a

Ritz-Carlton Residences.

Within months of taking reservations for ONE St. Petersburg, Kolter had lined up buyers for all 253 units in the 41-story tower at 100 First Ave. N. Units already are changing hands as demand for high-end condos downtown continues unabated.

According to an analysis by agent Peggy Naruns, four units have resold at price increases of up to 42 percent. None were on the market for more than five days. A fifth unit, listed at $1.1 million, is under contract.

We know of five units coming soon on higher floors ranging from $999,000 with a non-water view to $2.35 million with a water view, Naruns said.

The site of Kolters proposed tower near Albert Whitted Airport is not quite as desirable as that of ONE St. Petersburg, which is just a short block off Beach Drive and its row of restaurants. But the site is one of the few developable tracts near the citys waterfront, and a tower there would have wide-open views of the bay.

Property appraiser records show that the site is currently owned by a limited partnership whose address is that of Remington Hotels, a Dallas-based company that manages the Hilton and dozens of other hotels nationwide.

In a Dec. 22 letter to a Kolter subsidiary, the Federal Aviation Administration said it is conducting a study of the proposed tower to determine its effect upon the safe and efficient use of navigable air space. The letter refers to the structure as Building Kolter Bayfront Tower, Southeast corner.

Even if the FAA deems the project a hazard to aviation, it would not necessarily prevent its construction though some changes could be needed.

Last week, New Yorks Red Apple Group released a rendering of a proposed 50-story mixed-used tower on the 400 block of Central Avenue. It would be several blocks from the waterfront, although an ad in the New York Times promised breathtaking views of Tampa Bay.

Texto completo: Wilmington has agreed to pay $50,000, revise policies and train staff to settle a discrimination lawsuit filed by a Muslim school whose students were asked to leave a city pool last summer because of their garb.
In court records filed Tuesday, the city does not admit wrongdoing but does "regret that unclear swimwear policies and lack of specific training left the Plaintiffs feeling excluded from a City pool."
The lawsuit came after the principal of Darul-Amaanah Academy said her students were harassed and discriminated against by city staff because of their religion.
On June 25, then-pool manager Glenda Pinkett approached four 5- and 6-year-old girls wearing a combination of headscarves, T-shirts and leggings and "told the girls to leave the pool immediately because of 'what they were wearing,'" according to the lawsuit.
Pinkett claimed that a policy prohibited wearing cotton in the pool, according to the lawsuit. She later told The News Journal that the fabric clogs pool filters. In fact, there were no city or state policies against wearing cotton in public pools.
Darul-Amaanah principal Tahsiyn Ismaa'eel said the school had visited the city pool for three years without an issue. After that first incident, Ismaa'eel claimed the city failed to address her concerns and her group faced further harassment.
"As a result of their treatment at Foster Brown (pool), many of the children have come home in tears, shattered by their treatment by city employees and questioning whether their Islamic faith makes them unwelcomed and unwanted," the lawsuit states.
While The News Journal prepared to write a story about the incident, a representative for Mayor Mike Purzycki initially defended the supposed cotton ban as a safety issue.
As the story made national and international headlines, later prompting a Facebook Live discussion from The New York Times, Purzycki issued an apology.
The mayor said the city should be held accountable for what happened.
"I apologize to the children who were directed to leave a city pool because of the religious-required clothing they were wearing," Purzycki said in a statement. "We also referred to vaguely worded pool policies to assess and then justify our poor judgment, and that was also wrong."
On Tuesday, the city agreed to pay $20,000.03 to Darul-Amaanah Academy and $4,285.71 to benefit seven children.
The city will also clarify its dress code policy in city-operated pools, display the new regulations at each of the city's pools, provide additional training to pool employees and extend the length of the 2019 pool season through Labor Day.
Ismaa'eel said in a statement that it broke her heart to see children face "discrimination and humiliation from the city."
"Every child should be able to have fun in a public pool without having to worry about facing prejudice," she said.
The mayor's office declined to comment for this story.
According to the settlement, the city is supposed to issue a press release "contemporaneously" with the filing of the settlement. A media release was not disseminated by the city on Tuesday but was included in the settlement itself.
"Mayor Mike Purzycki and City Parks and Recreation Director Kevin Kelley said Wilmington is committed to ensuring the fair and equal treatment of all residents," the release states. "Both parties agreed that today's announced settlement helps to ensure that all residents of Wilmington are able to enjoy Wilmington's aquatic facilities."
A lawyer for Muslim Advocates, which represented the academy and its students, said in a statement that the incident in Wilmington never should have happened and the settlement "helps ensure that it will never happen again."
"Darul-Amaanah Academy's staff and families showed remarkable courage by publicly standing up for themselves and for the broader Wilmington community," said Juvaria Khan, a senior staff attorney.
"Everybody — especially young children — should be allowed to use the pool without fearing that they will be discriminated against because of what they believe or the way they look."

Texto completo: In 2019, Iowans will hear the phrase "fake news" whenever a report sullies a political party or presidential hopeful. We may support or scorn candidates without knowing fact from factoid.
This column explains what you can do about it.
People typically do not differentiate between journalism and media. Journalists report and edit news. Media mostly disseminate news (i.e. tweets, posts, blogs, websites, android apps, etc.). Journalists adhere to ethical standards. Social media does not.
Many voters no longer believe what they read, view or hear. We have a choice: Embrace lies and half-truths or subscribe (actually pay something) to access fact-based reports.
In 2005, I noted how journalism was metamorphosing into fake news: "Downsizing reporting staffs is dangerous in a republic founded on the principle that truth, not profit, should rise to the top." I added that disseminating opinion is cheaper than gathering fact because the former can be aligned to a target market.
Something else has arisen, prompting me to write in advance of 2020 political visits to Iowa.
Two psychologists, Gordon Pennycook and David Rand, just published an opinion piece titled "Why Do People Fall for Fake News?" They claim this happens for two reasons. One group's ability to reason is "hijacked" by partisan convictions. The other group is "mentally lazy."
A recent study published in Science Advances noted that those aged 65 and older were more responsible than any other age group in disseminating false news on Facebook during the 2016 election. This was true regardless of ideology, education level or political affiliation. I offer a third possibility about why this happens.
Media have de-evolved into an indistinguishable entity in the digital cloud. All it takes is one virally distributed inaccurate report to taint the cloud so that it rains falsehood on everyone doing journalism.
There is a flood of fake news on Facebook. This month, the BBC reported that Facebook has removed 500 pages and accounts of Russian fabricators targeting Central and Eastern Europe.
Get ready for the Russian assault on Iowa in advance of the Feb. 3, 2020 caucuses.
Fake news is a distinctly American creation perpetuated by the likes of Benjamin Franklin. In 1782, he fabricated a supplement to the Boston Independent Chronicle recounting wartime atrocities and gave that to British editors hoping they would reprint it and help secure reparations for U.S. citizens.
That model — dubious content disseminated by others — remains the primary facet of fake news.
A prime example is the recent BuzzFeed report that alleged special counsel Robert Mueller possessed evidence that President Trump instructed former lawyer Michael Cohen to lie to Congress.
When other outlets went with the report without sufficient fact-checking, a spokesperson for Mueller issued a statement calling the BuzzFeed article inaccurate.
By now the damage had been done.
As media columnist Jim Rutenberg writes, each mistake of this magnitude feeds the notion that all of journalism is "fake news" because of the "insatiable appetite" of social media and cable for fresh material.
Organizations like CNN and Fox News not only tell us the news — often relying on newspapers that still do it; they hire pundits to shape our opinions.
The average salary of broadcast news commentators was $56,680 in 2016, with the highest 10 percent paid $163,490. The average salary for reporters is $43,960. In Iowa, salaries range from $19,340-$50,720 and higher, with the average yearly pay of $36,870.
In an ideal world, untold millions spent on pundits would go to reporters who actually do news.
Fake news has a devastating effect on journalism and democracy.
Reporters have a calling. They hold government accountable so that we can make intelligent decisions in the voting booth. Journalists typically sacrifice time with loved ones, working ungodly hours — often involving travel — and live frugally for decades.
The general public doesn't witness the deep psychic pain of a reporter who gets a pink slip because people expect news for free.
The Pew Research Center reports that newsrooms continue to cut positions because of "dwindling print subscriptions." In a Jan. 28 article titled "Does Journalism Have Future?", staff writer Jill Lepore states, "Good reporting is expensive, but people do not want to pay for it."
Pay while you can.
Forbes published a list of trustworthy news organizations based on ethics and policies about corrections. They include The New York Times, Wall Street Journal, and Washington Post, among others.
Don't overlook local newspapers, the lifeblood of communities.
Yes, subscribe. Go further. Buy gift subscriptions for relatives and friends. Discuss the news face to face at the dinner table instead of on Facebook. If you have children, let them see you pore over the newsprint, pointing out stories about their school, hobby or upcoming events you might attend, including visits by presidential hopefuls.
It takes a village to save the village newspaper. A free press is worth the price of subscription.

LAWMAKERS, REGULATORS GRAPPLE WITH DATA PRIVACY

Texto completo: There has been some significant news lately that impacts your personal security and privacy.
You may remember a few columns ago, TechMan wrote about a possible solution for spammers who show a "spoofed" telephone number - increasingly one from your local exchange - on your caller ID to get you to pick up their calls.
You also may remember that the reason this new technology wasn't in use yet was that it depended on the phone companies to update their software.
To combat this, a bill has been reintroduced in the Senate (from a year ago) called TRACED. Translated from the code of acronym-loving Congress, it is the Telephone Robocall Abuse Criminal Enforcement and Deterrence Act.
Sponsored by Republican John Thune and Democrat Ed Markey, the bill would require voice service providers to adopt call authentication technology so scammers could not call you using a number other than the one from where the call originated.
The bill would also set a fine of $10,000 per call for people flouting telemarketing restrictions, give the Federal Communications Commission three years from a call to prosecute and require a number of federal and state agencies to study the problem and report to Congress.
Sprint catches up. Sprint has announced it's ending sharing your location data with third parties, joining the rest of the major carriers.
Congress has sent letters to mobile carriers demanding to know who these companies have shared Americans' location data with and what steps they've taken to protect people's privacy.
Big data dump. A newly revealed posting of stolen data tops them all for sheer volume: 772,904,991 unique email addresses, over 21 million unique passwords, all recently posted to a hacking forum. The data was posted on "a popular hacking forum" in a folder named Collection #1 and totaled 87 gigabytes The passwords have been decrypted, according to Wired.
You can find out if your email and password are in the dump at HaveIBeenpwned.com.
French fry Google. France fined Google $57 million for breaching the European Union's newly enacted online privacy rules, the biggest such penalty levied against a U.S. tech firm.
The complaint said Google lacked transparency and clarity in the way it informs users about its handling of personal data and failed to properly obtain their consent for personalized ads.
Facebook gut punch coming? The Federal Trade Commission is winding up its investigation into whether social media giant Facebook violated privacy rules and is expected to seek a record fine from the company, according to two people familiar with the inquiry, The New York Times reported.
The investigation began with revelations by the Times that a British political consulting firm, Cambridge Analytica, had obtained data from tens of millions of Facebook users without permission.
The FTC commissioners discussed a fine higher than Google's record $22 million settlement in 2012 for privacy violations, the Times quoted sources as saying.

Texto completo: Army veteran and white supremacist James Harris Jackson has pleaded guilty to a series of charges including murder stemming from his sword attack against a black man in Times Square.

Jackson, who described the March 2017 assault as a “practice run” for more attacks against black people, confessed that he drew a sword out of his jacket and stabbed a homeless black man identified as Timothy Caughman multiple times.

Caughman, who had been collecting recyclables, stumbled to a nearby police station after being stabbed. An ambulance took Caughman to Bellevue Hospital, where he died.

Jackson also acknowledged that he attempted to stalk multiple black men several days prior to the attack with a sword and two knives and that his objective was to attack "the African-American community in the United States and beyond." He said he attacked Caughman specifically due to his race.

Jackson told investigators after his arrest that he wanted to “influence the national conversation” and decided New York would attract the most attention.

“I was planning on doing basically as many as I could in Times Square,” he said, adding he planned to contact media outlets about the attack.

Jackson, who pleaded guilty despite the recommendation of his attorney not to, will be sentenced on Feb. 13 and may spend the rest of his life behind bars. He served in the Army for three years and served several tours in Afghanistan.

Manhattan district attorney Cy Vance, Jr. said that Jackson became “self-radicalized” after he left the military and said “he saw himself as a key element in starting a worldwide racial war,” per the New York Times.

Vance also warned after the proceedings that there would be consequences for violent acts inspired by white nationalism.

"White nationalism will not be normalized in New York," Vance told reporters Wednesday. "If you come here to kill New Yorkers in the name of white nationalism, you will be investigated, prosecuted, and incapacitated like the terrorist that you are."

Drama Over A Peanut Allergy Stalks Kids’ Theater Program

Texto completo: TURNERS FALLS, Mass. - It seemed like the perfect setting for a shy, thoughtful 10-year-old boy’s first steps on stage: a kids’ Shakespeare program that doesn’t hold auditions, guarantees everyone a substantial speaking role, emphasizes community and excludes no one.
Unless, as Mason Wicks-Lim and his mother, Ali, discovered, you have a life-threatening nut allergy.
The conflict that ensued over how the theater could accommodate Mason’s allergy eventually grew into a legal battle that created a rift in the community, highlighting the social struggles that people with food allergies often contend with, even as they fight for equal access.
The turmoil began when the family tried to enroll Mason, now 14, in Young Shakespeare Players-East, a revered institution in this small historic town that takes pride in its arts community and progressive activism. The theater’s director, Suzanne Rubinstein, at first rebuffed efforts to register Mason, citing concerns that no one on staff could be trained to administer an EpiPen, a shot of epinephrine used to treat severe allergic reactions. Then, after months of negotiations, she threatened to close the program if he joined.
Taking a stand
As word got around that Mason was not welcome, some of his peers in the program urged Rubinstein to reconsider. Sam Picone-Louro, who was then 12 and had played a soldier and a senator in the spring production of “Julius Caesar,” accused Rubinstein of discrimination.
“You said yourself there are no rejections and you are rejecting Mason,” Sam wrote in an email.
Rubinstein told Sam to apologize or find a different acting program, and then emailed other families warning them that she would brook no criticism. The program, Rubinstein said, “is not for everyone.” Sam did not apologize and was not allowed to continue in the program.
On Dec. 31, the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination concluded that Sam was right. The Shakespeare group may have not only illegally discriminated against Mason, the commission said, but also retaliated against Sam for speaking up. Two years earlier, in June 2016, the U.S. Department of Justice had reached a similar conclusion, saying that the theater violated the Americans With Disabilities Act by failing to make reasonable modifications to accommodate Mason.
The Massachusetts commission has ordered the Shakespeare group to settle with the families by Feb. 5 or face a public hearing and possible sanctions, said Mary Vargas, the lawyer who represents the two families.
Rubinstein did not agree to an interview, but YSP East’s lawyer, Frank DiPrima, said that “Mason was always welcome to register.” He said that Sam, who is transgender and uses the pronouns “they” and “them,” would have been welcomed back, had they been more respectful.
“We’re going to try, for the benefit of children past and future, to conciliate,” DiPrima said. “No other program of this size has done as much to accommodate children with disabilities.”
For Mason and Sam, the legal victories are bittersweet. The repercussions of the ouster from the theater group, which included many of their friends, affected the families as well as the children. Friendships frayed, and some ties were severed.
Many children with food allergies experience exclusion and discrimination, which “can be more detrimental than the allergy,” said Dr. James Baker Jr., a professor of medicine and director of the Mary H. Weiser Food Allergy Center at the University of Michigan.
“We hear this all the time, where people isolate kids, tell them they can’t go places, tell them they can’t participate in after-school activities or that their parents have to be there if they’re in a soccer game,” Baker said. “The child starts to feel like he or she is the problem.”
A growing issue
Though legal claims are rare, the number is likely to grow, due in part to a 2008 amendment to the Americans With Disabilities Act that has made it easier for people with food allergies - who are perfectly healthy most of the time - to qualify as a protected class, Vargas said.
In Mason’s case, his mother said she tried for six months to find a solution that would make it possible for Mason to join the Shakespeare group.
“My approach to Mason has always been that ‘You can do anything anyone can do, except eat nuts,’ ” Ali Wicks-Lim said. “And before this happened, it had never occurred to him that he might not be welcome in a place.”
In August 2015, Rubinstein emailed Wicks-Lim to say that she would have to be at the theater during rehearsals in case Mason needed an EpiPen injection.
After a lawyer informed her that the law required accommodating a child with a disability like a food allergy, Rubinstein reversed herself and emailed Wicks-Lim that she was seriously considering “whether to close shop!”
A few weeks later, Rubinstein said that the theater would implement a peanut- and tree nut-free snack and lunch policy and that she and another adult staff member would learn to use an EpiPen. But the same email said that the children in the program - ages 8 to 18 - were often left without adult supervision “for hours at a time (full days).”
In September, Wicks-Lim decided she could not safely enroll Mason. She let Mason make the call about whether to file a discrimination complaint.
Sam joined another local theater group, and Mason has taken up competitive rock climbing and is active in kung fu, where the group often asks him to choose the snacks. In 2016, two organizations honored Sam and Mason with awards for their advocacy on behalf of people with disabilities.
“I decided to fight the fight because I didn’t want someone else to experience what I did,” Mason said. “If there were no consequences, the same thing would happen again the next time a child with a food allergy wanted to join.”

Texto completo: An enthusiastic crowd gathered on the lawn of Monterey's Colton Hall on Saturday, brandishing signs that ran the gamut from affirmations of women's rights to anti-Trump slogans.
Speakers behind the podium rejoiced in the success women have had recently at the ballot box, decried a lack of equality between genders, and even shook their metaphorical fists at the "privileged white men in Washington." The crowd cheered.
This was the 2019 Women's March Monterey Bay.
Amid controversy over allegations of anti-Semitism by national-level march organizers, many local attendees still were passionate about the event.
Organizer Vanessa Wruble, who is Jewish, was asked to leave the group shortly after the first 2017 Women's March, and she told The New York Times her religion was a factor.
A detailed story by the Jewish online magazine Tablet said Women's March board members Tamika Mallory and Carmen Perez – whom Wruble recruited to add diversity to the original organizing group of four – confronted Wruble about the role Jews had in oppressing minorities of color.
She later co-founded March On, an organization that provides support and guidance to women-led groups throughout the country, with an estimated half of Saturday's sister marches getting help from the organization.
Esther Hobbs, chair of the Women's March Monterey Bay, acknowledged the issues the Women's March brand has had, but pointed out that WMMB is under the Women's March California umbrella, not that of Women's March, Inc.
"This is a great opportunity for all of us to really examine ourselves and see what we can do to help bring both the Women's March organizers, and even the nation, together," Hobbs said. "This is a much larger issue than Women's March."
A call to Temple Beth-El in Salinas was not immediately returned Saturday.
Many attending were first-time participants, and although they might have heard of the allegations of anti-Semitism, felt the call to speak out about inequality was more powerful.
"I'm here because not only as a woman but a person of color I'm disproportionately discriminated against," said East Salinas resident Vicky Murillo, who attended the march with a group of her friends. "I know what I stand for, and what I believe. I'm unapologetic."
The first-generation daughter of Mexican immigrants, Murillo said her parents, who "worked tirelessly" for their college degrees, inspired her to speak out about inequality, and to put the work in to make change.
Also in attendance were Penelope Rovick, 5, and Lucy Lemon, 6. Lemon made her own sign to carry, which said "Girls are Great," while Rovick's father made her sign. It read "Kindergarteners for Equality."
Their mothers, Jeanna Saccomano and Carla Lemon, brought their daughters to the march because they wanted to show Penelope and Lucy that equality sometimes had to be fought for.
"We talk a lot about equality being important," said Lemon. "And my daughter does not like Donald Trump."
Lemon laughed.
"They know that bullies shouldn't win," she added.
Saccomano said she treats her children, a boy and a girl, equally, and that they know they deserve the same respect and rights. "She's our future," Saccomano said.
For others, immigration, environment and education were key issues that pushed them to attend the rally and march.
Masako Toki, who works at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies, came to the United States 20 years ago from Japan. She said she still believed America was the best country in the world, but "things are not normal." By marching, she said, she hoped to draw attention to that.
Denise Powers, a middle-school math teacher, turned out Saturday along with her dog, Jacques, who she outfitted in a rainbow sweater and a "Donald Trump" collar and tie. Powers herself wore a t-shirt that read "A woman's place is in the White House."
"I'm appalled at our current government," she said, adding that education was particularly important to her, and Betsey DeVos's push for greater use of the charter school model across the U.S. concerned her greatly.
"A kid should be able to go into any school and receive the same resources," she said, "no matter where they go to school."
Not everyone in downtown Monterey for the day was interested in joining with the Women's March. Elise Gustafson, a Sacramento resident on vacation, was shopping on Alvarado Street when she saw the marchers striding past.
"I'm not a big feminist," she said, looking down the street at the marchers as they headed for the Customs House, where they would take a group photo.
"Yeah, I'm not about that either," her daughter, Meghan, chimed in.
"I suppose everybody should have equal rights, not special rights," Gustafson said. "I raise my children that way, too."
Hobbs of WMMB said the day met all her expectations. The number of marchers has steadily dropped over the years, with close to 4,000 attendees showing up in 2016 and between 2100 and 2400 participating Saturday, by the estimate of WMMB.
Diminished interest is to be expected in a non-election year. After the enthusiasm generated by the first march, the movement spurred a spike in female activism before the 2018 midterms, in the form of candidates and involvement in campaigns.
Hobbs, however, said the real work she wanted to do was to bring the community together and inspire people.
"We can make an impact," Hobbs said. "We already inspired change by getting more women to run for office across this country, and we wanted to celebrate that but make it clear that we still have a lot of work to make sure we reach equality.
"I think that people felt really inspired, and they walked away recognizing that there are actions we can take in our everyday lives to make an impact in the future."

Texto completo: Books & Brews now owns one of the state's OG craft breweries.
The 5-year-old combination bookstore and brewpub and growing franchise business acquired near-decade-old Flat12 Bierwerks on Saturday for an undisclosed amount.
The purchase made sense, Books & Brews owner Jason Wuerfel said. He has partnered with Flat12 for about two years to license and brew the beers on tap at Books & Brews.
Some beer was brewed out of Books & Brews' flagship location near Home Depot on the northeast side, "the nano brewery that could," as Wuerfel calls it, and that won't change. But as the business grew from one location to nine franchises, and interest increased after the concept was featured in The New York Times earlier this month, the need for more beer production became greater.
"As we grew, we got to a critical point where you start to look at the numbers," Wuerfel said. "Really, the purchase came out of our relationship with the brewers there."
Visitors to Flat12, in the Holy Cross neighborhood on the east side, won't notice much of a change in operations, branding or beers, he said.
"If there's any change that I'm going to bring to Flat 12, I'm going to double and triple down on the racing theme," Wuerfel said. "Perceptually, no one will notice a difference. It's really just the same as it was before. We just own both of the brands."
Wuerfel doesn't expect changes to the nearly 20 Flat12 employees, either.
"My biggest message for the group is any time change happens, things can get weird really quickly," he said. "I want them to see us coming in as less intrusive and more of a support role, that we're here for them."
Former Flat12 owner Andy Teed, who took over the brewery in 2016, said he wasn't planning to sell the brewery until Wuerfel approached him with the idea.
"(Wuerfel) is very much behind the brand, which was important to me," Teed said. "Craft beer is all about local. We're very much, and we will continue to be under Jason's leadership, an Indiana brand."
Teed retains a minority ownership in Flat12 to Wuerfel's 72 percent. A third owner, a high school friend of Wuerfel's, also has a minority part of the business.
Teed came into ownership at Flat12 during a turbulent financial time but said the team has been able to stabilize the business.
Wuerfel said he is excited for the brewery's future.
"I think Flat12 is doing very well as it is," he said. "I really wouldn't have tried to take this step if I didn't already have confidence in the brewhouse."

Texto completo: A Wright State University graduate has been nominated for an Academy Award for her work on Marvel’s “Black Panther.”
Hannah Beachler, a 2005 WSU graduate, is the first African-American to be nominated in the category for Best Production Design.
Beachler grew up in Centerville and studied fashion design at the University of Cincinnati before attending Wright State’s Motion Picture Program.

Beachler explained her role in films as “forcing the viewer to see things in a certain way,” during a talk with students at WSU in December 2017.
“Production design is what everything else bounces off of — it’s architecture, it’s color palette and it’s everything in the room,” Beachler said. “I’m the first one hired after the director and first one on the job after the director. I work with producers, cinematographer, costume design and visual effects.”

Before “Black Panther,” Beachler worked as a production designer on the Academy Award-winning movie “Moonlight.” The film won the Academy Award for Best Picture in 2017. She also worked on Beyonce’s visual album “Lemonade” that originally premiered on HBO, according to Wright State.
“Black Panther” has also been nominated for numerous other Academy Awards including Best Picture, Sound Editing, Sound Mixing, Original Score, Original Song, and Costume Design.
“A Star Is Born,” another film with multiple Oscar nominations, has connections to the Miami Valley.
Bradley Cooper screened the film at the Little Art Theatre in Yellow Springs in October.

The movie features Yellow Springs resident and Cooper’s real-life pal Dave Chappelle, who was also there and participated in a question-and-answer session with Cooper after the screening.
In the film Chappelle plays a character called Noodles, an old friend of Cooper’s character. Chappelle’s daughter Sanaa, also has a role in the film.
“I can’t wait for everyone to see this movie, man,” Chappelle told the Yellow Springs audience. “This movie is real powerful. People don’t know what it’s like to be in entertainment or step on a big stage. This movie really does capture the content of it. It’s gut wrenching up there.”
“A Star is Born” has been nominated for Best Picture, Lead Actor, Lead Actress, Supporting Actor, Adapted Screenplay, Cinematography, Sound Mixing, and Original Song.
The 91st Academy Awards ceremony will be Feb. 24.

John Kasich quietly courts New Hampshire voters on MLK Day

Texto completo: The Boston Globe publishes a good 770 miles from the Ohio governor’s mansion. It's also not the New York Times.

So why is former Ohio Gov. John Kasich writing op-eds in it?

The Globe is the largest newspaper in New England, with a circulation stretching into the critically important political state of New Hampshire. These two facts make the most recent op-ed from Kasich especially interesting. He just penned a piece honoring Martin Luther King Jr. in the Boston Globe. He fueled that much more speculation about when, not if, he will mount a primary challenge against President Trump in the process.

The piece will be unobjectionable to most. Kasich slings stones at the incivility playing out in the capital city, flings some arrows at the problems plaguing Middle America, and proposes community answers to national problems.

“If we can help just one person to be better,” Kasich writes, “we can change the entire world. And when we work together as a community to meet this challenge, who knows what we can accomplish?”

The bigger question is whether Kasich wants that community to work together to make him president. He has spent the last two years of his term as governor openly mulling whether or not to take another shot at the White House.

If Kasich were doing anything else, Kasich would have likely pitched his MLK remonstrance to any of the Ohio papers. He could have run it in the Plain Dealer or the Cincinnati Enquirer or the Columbus Dispatch. Each fine papers, but none has a readership in New Hampshire.

Kasich finished second in the Granite State in the 2016 Republican primary. A good way for the governor to finish better in that state is to get his name in front of those voters early. So when will he announce?

A uniquely New Mexican act of protest

Texto completo: The resonant thump of Native drums rang out and the scent of burning sage wafted through the winter air.
With a focus on the plight of women in the state's Native American communities, Santa Fe's third annual Women's March was an inclusive -- and uniquely New Mexican -- act of protest. Still, activists' overarching message echoed that of marchers nationwide: We've come so far and yet we still have so far to go.
In a somewhat smaller demonstration than in years past, about 2,500 people marched Saturday morning from the Roundhouse to the Plaza in support of various of human-rights issues. The Santa Fe march was one of more than 250 events planned worldwide.
Native American marchers led the throngs down Old Santa Fe Trail, chanting familiar rallying cries and brandishing signs, including two that read "Fighting the Patriarchy since 1492" and "There will not be gender equality unless there is racial equality."
Another sign featured a New York Times photograph of U.S. Rep. Deb Haaland of Albuquerque, a member of Laguna Pueblo and one of the first two Native women to serve in Congress.
The theme of this year's marches nationwide,
#WomensWave, was particularly relevant for the marchers in New Mexico, where in November dozens of women, including Haaland, were swept into office for the first time.
At the rally following Saturday's march, several of those women, including state Reps. Andrea Romero, D-Santa Fe, and Susan Herrera, D-Española, joined speakers on stage. Newly elected State Land Commissioner Stephanie Garcia Richard read a letter from Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, who took office Jan. 1.
"One hundred years ago, there was only one woman in Congress," Garcia Richard read. "There are right now a record 127 female members of Congress. ... This is all part of the change we want to see -- women not only with a seat at the table but at the head of the table."
But the mood was not always so optimistic.
A hush fell over the crowd when Amber Morningstar Byars, a Choctaw and Chickasaw activist who works with event co-organizer 3 Sisters Collective, took the stage to discuss high rates of murder and sexual violence among Native women.
The epidemic, Byars said, is an underreported, underinvestigated plague on Native communities.
Murder is the third-leading cause of death among Native American and Alaska Native women. And Native women are 10 times more likely than the national average to be murdered, Byars said, citing data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
"Whenever I find myself surrounded by a group of my Native sisters, like I am right now, I wonder to myself, which one of us is next?" Byars said.
After reading the names of missing or murdered Native women, including 23 from New Mexico, Byars called on white marchers to ally themselves with Native women.
"The epidemic is not going to end anytime soon unless you get involved," she said. "We ask you to call and to write to your local, state and federal representatives and demand that they put missing and murdered indigenous women on their agendas. ... Please get involved, because our lives depend on it."
Byars was one of 16 speakers to address marchers at the 2½-hour rally. In addition to Native rights, they spoke of equality for all races and genders, environmental justice, equal pay, poverty, sexual violence, immigration issues and reproductive rights.
Although it has faced allegations of anti-Semitism and internal turmoil in recent months, the national Women's March organization has billed itself as a diverse coalition pushing a broad social justice agenda.
As the hours passed Saturday, the crowd dwindled. Santa Fe residents Justin Walters, Mica Carlile andMireya Vazquez remained on the Plaza's periphery.
Carlile, holding a sign that read "My body, my choice," said she'd joined the throngs this year to advocate for reproductive rights.
"I'm extremely concerned about Roe v. Wade being overturned, and I'm worried about women's access to health care in general, not just reproductive," Carlile said. "I'm worried that that's under attack and facing heavy regulation by men, mostly."
Carlile said she has other issues on her mind, too: "We'd need, like, 20 posters to fill all the things that we care about right now and all the things we're marching for."
Despite the pressing concerns, for Vazquez, the tone of the march was tinged with joy for the first time.
"We are doing something," she said. "Even if it's just two or three hours out of the year, the fact that this year we elected over 100 women [to Congress], this is ... obviously raising awareness and making women feel empowered."
"It really does feel like a celebration," she added.

Dezart Performs' opening night show of "Perfect Arrangement" written by Topher Payne and directed by Michael Shaw took the audience back to the "Fab 50's" but had them thinking that maybe life wasn't so fabulous then. Shaw said, "If you loved 'I Love Lucy', or any of those classic 1950's sitcoms, you'll feel right at home with the tone of this play."
The 50's was the time when children learned to read with the Jack and Jill series: dad worked and mom stayed home to raise the children. And if mom worked outside the home, careers were usually limited to secretary, nurse or school teacher.
Wild –Western-themed shows required young males to maintain a John-Wayne-like stoicism into their adult lives. Sexual freedom was restricted. Young men and women who admitted to being gay were seen as being a shame to their family, a menace to society and some gay youth were sent to sanitariums for shock treatments or hormone therapies. Many gay men and women in the 50's eventually married heterosexually for social disguise. TV and movie stars masqueraded as straight, as any suggestion that they might be homosexual could spell instant death to their career.
One may wonder why these Victorian standards prevailed. Perhaps it is because at that time most Americans got all of their information from the same limited sources: three TV networks, AM radio and a few mainstream popular magazines which meant that public tastes and political leanings enjoyed very little diversity compared to today.
"Perfect Arrangement" is the story of two gay men and two gay women who tried to cover their sexual identities by becoming two "normal married couples" living in adjoining apartments by day and sneaking through a closet to maintain their love lives each night. One man was an employee of the U.S. State Department in Washington, DC and was tasked with identifying sexual deviants within their ranks. His male lover was a teacher, fearful of losing his job if discovered. This story was inspired by the earliest stirrings of the American gay rights movement. The very accomplished, professional actors provided sitcom style laughs and drama as the characters attempted to hide their private lives.
Dezart Performs, in its eleventh season, has received many awards and great reviews from the New York Times and Theatre Mania.

Court affirms media was wrong: Those videos of Planned Parenthood dealing in baby parts weren't deceptively edited

Texto completo: The 5th Circuit Court of Appeals has issued a ruling that allows Texas to strip Planned Parenthood of its Medicaid funding.

The motion, which is tied to the Texas Health and Human Services Commission’s call to have Planned Parenthood removed as a qualified Medicaid provider following the release of several damning undercover videos, should come as a major blow to not just the abortion provider, but also the press.

The ruling shatters utterly the claim that the tapes, which feature Planned Parenthood associates discussing the processes by which organs from the remains of aborted children can be harvested and donated (for a fee), were “selectively edited.” It also affirms that Planned Parenthood associates did indeed circumvent legal and ethical guidelines in pursuit of harvesting human organs, all of this in direct contradiction to what the so-called women’s health organization and its eager defenders in the press claimed after the tapes were released in 2015.

The 5th Circuit's decision (WARNING: graphic content) includes these two key quotes affirming earlier findings by the Texas Office of Inspector General and its Chief Medical Officer:

"[T]he record reflects that OIG had submitted a report from a forensic firm concluding that the video was authentic and not deceptively edited. And the plaintiffs [Planned Parenthood] did not identify any particular omission or addition in the video footage.
[…]
[T]here is no question that the OIG here made factual findings after viewing the videos and related evidence. On the basis of the administrative record … the OIG determined that video discussions “centered on clinic processes and tissue packaging rather than the abortion procedure itself; the video featured repeated discussion about the position of the fetus in the uterus, the risk to the patient, and the patient’s pain tolerance.” The OIG further concluded, based on the videos, that the Provider Plaintiffs at a minimum violated federal standards regarding fetal tissue research and standards of medical ethics by allowing doctors to alter abortion procedures to retrieve tissue for research purposes or allowing the researchers themselves to perform the procedures.

If you still believe everything you read in the news, the court’s ruling this week should come as a great shock.

When pro-life activist David Daleiden and his team at the Center for Medical Progress released the tapes in 2015, Planned Parenthood leaned heavily on the defense that the videos were unfairly doctored. This defense was parroted immediately by a servile press, despite that Planned Parenthood never explained what additional context would’ve better explained its senior director of medical services claiming the group was "doing a little better than" breaking even for donated organs (it is illegal to profit from the donation of fetal tissue. It is also illegal under federal law to perform partial birth abortions).

"Second Heavily Edited Planned Parenthood Attack Video Is Also a Big Bust,” Slate declared confidently.

"[A] little-known anti-abortion activist," Mother Jones reported, "ignited a firestorm by releasing ... selectively edited videos."

Planned Parenthood also enlisted the aid of the Democratic-aligned firm Fusion GPS to “prove” that the tapes were unfairly edited. Fusion GPS’ subsequent report, which was based on a review of only four of the eight videos that had been released, was a note-for-note recitation of Planned Parenthood’s "selectively edited" defense. This was also good enough for newsrooms, which were quick to highlight the Fusion GPS "study."

“Report for Planned Parenthood finds sting videos manipulated,” Politico reported, stressing that Fusion GPS was careful to bring in "video and transcription experts" who are "not associated with Planned Parenthood."

The firms "findings" are the first "comprehensive account of the video's discrepancies,” the article added.

"Planned Parenthood Videos Were Altered, Analysis Finds,” the New York Times reported.

The Huffington Post said elsewhere that the, "'Sting' Videos Of Planned Parenthood Are Totally Manipulated, Forensic Analysis Finds,” adding that even “the supposedly unedited 'full' footage is misleadingly altered, experts say.”

Not a single one of these reports mentioned Fusion GPS' historical ties to the Democratic Party, which is about as aligned with Planned Parenthood as the GOP is with the National Rifle Association.

As certain newsrooms worked hard to delegitimize the videos based on nothing but the say-so of Planned Parenthood and a Democrat-aligned public relations firm, other newsrooms went out of their way to portray the producer of the tapes as an “extremist.”

Four years later, we learn from the 5th Circuit that the videos were neither selectively edited, nor was it false to say that Planned Parenthood associates circumvented legal, medical, and ethical guidelines in pursuit of salvaging human remains.

The press talks a big game these days about protecting the truth and safeguarding facts. But stories like the undercover Planned Parenthood tapes are a good reminder that, for the national media, some facts are more deserving of protection than others.

The New York Times' man in Cuba: Playing the role of a dictator's pawn

Texto completo: Twenty-nine years after the New York Times conceded that Walter Duranty’s Soviet apologia represented “some of the worst reporting” to appear in its pages, the newspaper is still peddling propaganda in the service of oppressive regimes.

“Why Infants May Be More Likely to Die in America Than Cuba,” reads the headline to Times columnist Nicholas Kristoff’s latest offering. The story’s subhead adds, “Many Americans would welcome some traits of the island’s free, universal health care system.”

It’d be a fascinating argument, and one that may very well change some minds, were it not for two things. First, Kristoff’s conclusions are based on data provided by the Cuban government itself, which even Kristoff is forced to admit are highly dubious, reported as they are by an oppressive police. Second, and more importantly, Cuba maintains a low infant mortality rate in part by pressuring doctors into performing abortions in cases where there is even the slightest hint of a defect, often in contravention of the mother's wishes.

This is not some great mystery. It's been known for some time.

"Cuba does have a very low infant mortality rate, but pregnant women are treated with very authoritarian tactics to maintain these favorable statistics," the University of Oklahoma’s Tassie Katherine Hirschfeld, who spent nine months in Cuba studying its healthcare system, told PolitiFact in 2014.

She added, "They are pressured to undergo abortions that they may not want if prenatal screening detects fetal abnormalities. If pregnant women develop complications, they are placed in ‘Casas de Maternidad’ for monitoring, even if they would prefer to be at home. Individual doctors are pressured by their superiors to reach certain statistical targets. If there is a spike in infant mortality in a certain district, doctors may be fired. There is pressure to falsify statistics."

Then there's the fact that Cuba also engages in eugenic abortions.

If you can believe it, the word "abortion" doesn't appear once in Kristoff’s column, which is mostly a collection of cliched we-are-poor-but-happy anecdotes. (At one point he writes, "There’s a Cuban saying: ‘We live like poor people, but we die like rich people.’" Really.) Even more remarkable than that, Kristoff admits upfront that Cuba’s official figures may be bogus. Yet, he suggests anyway that America could learn a thing or two from its way of doing healthcare.

Kristoff writes:

"Cuba is poor and repressive with a dysfunctional economy, but in health care it does an impressive job that the United States could learn from. According to official statistics (about which, as we’ll see, there is some debate), the infant mortality rate in Cuba is only 4.0 deaths per 1,000 live births. In the United States, it’s 5.9.
[…]
The figures should be taken with a dose of skepticism. Still, there’s no doubt that a major strength of the Cuban system is that it assures universal access. Cuba has the Medicare for All that many Americans dream about.
He goes on to say in reference to whether Cuba’s healthcare statistics are fake, "I’m not in a position to judge who’s right, but any manipulation seems unlikely to make a huge difference to the reported figures.” This is simply an absurd statement, in or out of context.

Why is the Times publishing a column based on figures that the author does not trust, gathered by a regime that has every incentive to falsify them? And of course, there isn't even a mention of the fact that, even if by some miracle the numbers are roughly in the ballpark, Cuba may just be aborting its way to a low infant mortality rate.

The column would be easy to forgive were it not for the fact that peddling this harmful nonsense is part of Kristoff’s entire schtick. Indeed, this isn’t his first time playing the pawn for an oppressive regime (see: his Instagram photos of food, folks, and fun (!) from within North Korea’s borders).

Basically, if you have some propaganda you want spread around the United States, Kristoff is your man.

Maryland lawmakers still dazed, confused ; on marijuana laws; Guest column

Texto completo: For all of our state's issues, legislators are spending an awful lot of time trying to figure out how to get people high.
Once again, legislators will be spending time this session correcting mistakes made with Maryland's marijuana regime. The board that governs marijuana use in our state wants the General Assembly to clarify the rules on whether out-of-state marijuana companies can administer marijuana businesses owned by in-state licensees.
Marijuana legalization in Maryland has been a boondoggle from the very start. Instead of creating a free market that allows marijuana growers and distributors to grow their businesses free of regulation, the Democrats have created a quasi-state controlled industry where state government picks winners and losers. And the winners tend to be politically connected Democrats.
If Democrats were truly serious about making medical marijuana available to patients as efficiently and inexpensively as possible, they would not create these barriers for "national" marijuana companies to come in to purchase licenses or operate dispensaries.
How is the marijuana consumer harmed if an out-of-state company enters into a management agreement owned by a local licensee? I'd be willing to bet that a company with such an agreement has more experience, more resources, and the ability to deliver a higher quality product to its customers. But of course, those out-of-state companies don't have the political connections to local Democrats that in-state operators and licensees have.
The irony is the fact that the same Democrats who want to ensure local control of the marijuana market are the same Democrats who want to harm local breweries for the sake of protecting liquor distributorships that make it easier for out-of-state breweries to dominate the market. Again, all to ensure that politically connected distributors are protected.
And none of this questions whether or not we should be legalizing marijuana in the first place.
A recent New York Times op-ed by Alex Berenson highlights the issues with marijuana legalization. Berenson points out that states that legalized marijuana for recreational use have seen increases in murders and aggravated assaults, most of which can be linked to marijuana consumption.
The marijuana black market doesn't go away. And there's a noted increase in paranoia, psychosis and schizophrenia from pot users, with an increase in the likelihood of falling victim to these conditions as consumption of the drug increases.
Pot advocates like to cite the medical necessity of legalizing marijuana or medicinal purposes. But Malcolm Gladwell, writing for the New Yorker, points out that there is virtually no peer-reviewed research regarding the effects of marijuana consumption on patients. Medical marijuana is touted as a wonder-drug for any number of maladies, but there is virtually no scientific evidence that proves this to be true.
Concerns about the effects of marijuana legalization on people or society have certainly not stopped Democrats from rushing to promote the full legalization of marijuana for both recreational and medical uses as soon as possible.
Ironically, as Democrats are working toward full marijuana legalization they are simultaneously trying to restrict the purchase of cigarettes to those 21-years and older. Both cigarettes and marijuana are harmful to those who smoke them, but Democrats seem willing to accept the risks to both individuals and society of widespread pot usage.
So what are we really doing here when it comes to pot? We're doing two things: we're rapidly barreling down an unknown highway of legalizing a drug at a time where advocates are trying to brush aside legitimate concerns about the health, societal, or environmental impacts of legalization while simultaneously creating a state-administered behemoth designed to limit consumer choice while enriching the politically-connected.
No matter what your position on marijuana legalization is, there's no question that Maryland's marijuana policy is a mess and that the General Assembly's insistence on barreling toward full legalization is going negatively impact the health and well-being of Marylanders and hurt our state economically for years to come.

More Than a Little Nuance When Giuliani Says, 'There Was No Collusion'

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- President Trump's personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani backtracked on Thursday from a surprising assertion he had made a night earlier that left open the possibility that Trump campaign aides might have coordinated with Russia in its election interference in 2016.
"There was no collusion by President Trump in any way, shape or form," Mr. Giuliani said in a statement on Thursday, reiterating the president's longstanding defense against accusations that his campaign secretly coordinated with Moscow to help swing the election. "Likewise, I have no knowledge of any collusion by any of the thousands of people who worked on the campaign."
He added, referring to discredited conspiracy theories that the president and his allies have long cited, "The only knowledge I have in this regard is the collusion of the Clinton campaign with Russia, which has so far been ignored."
Mr. Giuliani was seeking to clarify an interview on Wednesday night in which he stopped short of defending Trump campaign aides, drawing speculation that he might have inside knowledge of possible coordination with Russia.
"I never said there was no collusion between the campaign or between people in the campaign," he told CNN. He added: "I said the president of the United States. There is not a single bit of evidence the president of the United States committed the only crime you could commit here, conspired with the Russians to hack" the Democratic National Committee.
[ Trump allies have repeatedly shifted their defense as evidence of contacts with Russians grew.]
Mr. Giuliani's backpedaling was the latest in a series of conflicting comments he has made about the investigation by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III. The evolution of his statements have suggested shifts in the president's defense strategy, often following developments in the investigations. On Tuesday, prosecutors for the special counsel filed a 200-page, mostly redacted court document related to the case against Mr. Trump's onetime campaign chairman, Paul Manafort. Among the little information that was not blacked out were details about his relationship with a Russian whom prosecutors have said has ties to Russian intelligence.
The special counsel's document was in response to a recent filing by Mr. Manafort's legal team, which inadvertently disclosed that Mr. Manafort had provided his Russian associate with American polling data -- details that offer the clearest example yet that the Trump campaign may have tried to coordinate with Russia before the 2016 election.
Mr. Giuliani has previously denied that there was coordination by Trump campaign aides.
"When I say the Trump campaign, I mean the upper levels of the Trump campaign," Mr. Giuliani said during a July interview with Fox News. "I have no reason to believe anybody else did. The only ones I checked with obviously are the top four or five people."
Mr. Giuliani also went a bit further on the collusion defense, telling Fox, "Even if he did it, it's not a crime."
The president agreed with him in a subsequent Twitter post, and added that Hillary Clinton, his former Democratic rival, was the one who was doing the colluding.
Mr. Trump has long maintained that his campaign never aided Russia's meddling, even as the special counsel inquiry has revealed communications between Russians and some Trump campaign aides.
While the word "collusion" has no defined legal meaning, in plain English, it means working together, typically in secret, to do something illicit. And whether Mr. Trump knew during the campaign of any Russian attempts to disrupt the election has been a central question in the investigation that started in the summer of 2016.
Mr. Trump's former personal lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, was prepared to tell prosecutors that Mr. Trump knew about a June 2016 meeting in Trump Tower that was arranged so campaign officials could get damaging information on Mrs. Clinton from Russians.
The president and his lawyers have denied that Mr. Trump had any knowledge of the meeting until July 2017, when The New York Times was preparing to publish an article about it.
At the time, when the White House was scrambling to prepare a statement about the Trump Tower meeting in response to The Times's article, Mr. Trump met with President Vladimir V. Putin for more than two hours in Hamburg, Germany, where they were attending an economic summit meeting. Later that day, Mr. Trump sought out the Russian leader during a summit meeting dinner. Only interpreters, the secretary of state at the time, Rex W. Tillerson, and Russia's foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, were in the first meeting with Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin. Afterward, Mr. Trump took his interpreter's notes and told the interpreter not to tell anyone what was discussed. No American officials were present for the second encounter during the dinner.
The following day, while Mr. Trump traveled back to Washington on Air Force One, he called a Times reporter to say that the Russians had been falsely accused by American intelligence agencies of hacking during the campaign. The president also huddled with his aides to draft a statement in response to the article about the Trump Tower meeting and personally dictated a misleading account that the meeting was about Russian adoptions. He did not admit that the meeting was arranged to address Russia's offer to help his campaign, which emails later obtained by The Times confirmed.
Earlier this week, senators questioned Mr. Trump's nominee to be the next attorney general, William P. Barr, about how the Justice Department would handle a hypothetical report from Mr. Mueller. That there will be such a report at the end of the special counsel's investigation is just speculation, but Mr. Barr was pressed on whether he would share the report with Congress and the public and whether what he shared would be an altered version of the original.
The questioning drew on comments Mr. Giuliani had previously made about how the president might invoke executive privilege to prevent the report from going to Congress, or that the White House might edit the report before sending it to lawmakers "so we can correct it if they're wrong."
Mr. Barr assured senators on Tuesday that the White House would not be correcting the report before releasing it. And Mr. Giuliani said his comments Wednesday on CNN had not been an effort to address a possible Mueller report detailing evidence of cooperation between Trump campaign aides and Russia.
"I have no knowledge of collusion involving the campaign, nor does the president," Mr. Giuliani told The Times on Thursday. "However, I only represent the president, and that's all I can speak for."

Texto completo: As November and its slight autumnal chill — along with whipping Santa Ana winds, and huge wildfires in the north and the south — descends upon California every year, a state legislator’s mind turns to … well, naturally, to the Hawaiian island of Maui.
That’s where 10 members of the California Assembly and two state senators gathered this past November along with some of the state’s top power company officials at the Fairmont Kea Lani resort. It was four days of mai tais, long walks on the beach and casual conversation about just how much responsibility the utilities deserve for the destruction wrought by the fires that look to have been sparked in several cases by their company equipment.
Dan Howle, executive director and chairman of the California Independent Voter Project, said that no lobbying was permitted and that no specific legislation had been discussed, according to a report in The New York Times.
Uh huh. Perhaps by some formal definition, such as the names of specific numbered bills not being spoken out loud, there might have been no “lobbying” underneath the palm trees. But of course the utilities are trying to influence the politicians. Consumer Watchdog reports that the annual event’s sponsors included Southern California Edison, San Diego Gas & Electric and Pacific Gas & Electric, utilities that contributed to the campaigns of between 80 percent and 90 percent of state legislators over the last two years.
Yes, this luau goes on every year and yes, we have criticized its untoward appearance in the past. We understand that the parties that attend the, well, party, who fork out $8,000 apiece to attend, “pay their own way” to do so. For the politicians, that means wealthy campaign donors foot the bill. Donors such as Edison and PG&E.
But as the latter goes into bankruptcy and all of the investor-owned utilities hit the panic button over their current and future wildfire-stoked liabilities, this looks worse than ever. Californians were running for their lives in Malibu and Paradise, and a dozen of their representatives in Sacramento were schmoozing with utility execs, buffeted by gentle trade winds.
The attendees were Assembly members Frank Bigelow, Bill Brough, Ian Calderon, Jim Cooper, Tom Daly, Heath Flora, Jim Frazier, Reggie Jones-Sawyer, Freddie Rodriguez and Blanca Rubio, along with state Sens. Ben Hueso and Cathleen Galgiani.
Defenders of the yearly bash say that, yes, it’s in a nice corner of the world, but that it’s important for lawmakers to be able to visit with utility execs about the issues that concern the hard-pressed industry.
Here’s what Jack Pitney, the former Republican National Committee staffer and current Claremont McKenna College political science professor says: “Going to Maui for a public-policy conference is perfectly appropriate if, say, you work for the Maui County Department of Environmental Management. It does not make sense if your portfolio is in California. . . . There are plenty of conference centers throughout the state. If you wanted to get actual work done, you’d meet in Glendale, where there aren’t many distractions.”
And it’s not just the optics that concern us. The situation could not be more fraught with danger for California taxpayers as the utilities scramble for their financial lives. After the 2017 Maui confab, legislators put forward and approved a bill that allowed PG&E to issue billions of dollars in bonds that would help pay for wildfire damages earlier that year. Former Gov. Jerry Brown signed that bill and then allowed the company to pass those costs on to its ratepayers.
Who knows what utility-backed legislation will blow in from the tropics this legislative session?

Republicans sanctioned Steve King. Why won't Democrats even criticize Rashida Tlaib for promoting anti-Semitism?

Texto completo: After Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, was quoted in the New York Times as musing about when "white supremacist" and "white nationalist" became offensive terms, he was widely condemned by fellow Republicans, and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., has stripped King of committee assignments. Yet Freshman Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., continues to promote anti-Semitism, and yet far from sanctioning her in any way, Democrats haven't even criticized her.

As a Palestinian Muslim female Tlaib has been celebrated by Democrats and the media as a trailblazer, symbolic of the diversity of the new House majority. Yet ever since her election, she has been unapologetically promoting anti-Semitism.

In the most recent example, she was photographed with a supporter at a private party in Detroit celebrating her swearing in to Congress. As I reported, the man pictured was a Palestinian activist who has praised the terrorist group Hezbollah, said Israel did not have the right to exist, and has called for Israeli "Zionist terrorist" Jews to return to Poland, where roughly three million Jews were killed during the Holocaust.

Tlaib's response wasn't to deny it or distance herself from the man or his comments, but to lash out at the "right-wing media" for reporting it and defiantly saying, "Yes, I am Muslim and Palestinian. Get over it."

This, of course, is not a one off event. Shortly after her election, she promoted a petition to reinstate Marc Lamont Hill, who was fired as a CNN pundit after he made comments calling for the elimination of Israel "from the river to the sea" and endorsing violence against Jews as a legitimate tactic of "resistance." Tlaib also unleashed the anti-Semitic "dual loyalty" smear to lawmakers backing a measure targeting boycotts of Israel. She herself has endorsed the boycott Israel, or BDS, movement.

Just last year, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., declared before the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, "Why does BDS single Israel out alone for condemnation when there is such a double standard – when the world treats everybody one way and the Jew or the Jewish State another way? There's only one word for it; anti-Semitism. Let us call out the BDS movement for what it is. Let us delegitimize the delegitimizers by letting the world know when there is a double-standard, whether they know it or not, they are actively participating in an anti-Semitic movement."

It doesn't take much to speak those words before a pro-Israel audience, but now Schumer is nowhere to be seen when it comes to calling out somebody within his own party who is "actively participating in an anti-Semitic movement."

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., told AIPAC in 2017, "I hope we can come together on efforts to oppose boycott, divestment and sanctions. We must." Really? How sincere could she be in her conviction that "we must" oppose BDS if she can't even criticize it within her own caucus?

Pelosi and Schumer are cowards. They have a base that is increasingly hostile toward Israel, and increasingly willing to excuse or downplay anti-Semitism that's masked as mere criticism of Israel. Now they are afraid to call it out. Their silence on Tlaib speaks volumes.

McCarthy takes control of GOP by punishing Steve King

Texto completo: House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy's decision not to seat Rep. Steve King on any committees was seen by Republicans as a sign that McCarthy has taken full control of the GOP conference, and he will do what it takes to make it the majority party again in the House.

"[I]t's very important. It's a defining moment," Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., told the Washington Examiner . "It's his first act, and it shows that he's serious about us doing the things we need to do to get back in the majority and for us standing for things we're all proud of. I applaud him for making what's a very difficult decision, and I think it's the right one."

Lawmakers in the room Monday night said McCarthy's decision to ban King, R-Iowa, from three committees was met with "near-universal" applause. Many House Republicans believe the time had come for action against the troublesome Iowa Republican, who had been espousing questionable beliefs for years, and were pleased that McCarthy, R-Calif., made the move in the first few days of his leadership.

McCarthy's initial plan was to strip King of his expected post on the Judiciary Committee, which included a potential ranking member post on the subcommittee on the Constitution and Civil Justice, according to a source familiar with McCarthy's thinking. But McCarthy decided that comments in past years "warranted a more comprehensive examination" of King's future in the conference, according to the source. The steering committee agreed.

Not only was the decision from the committee unanimous, but most of the conference agreed. According to a source in the room, the only member who stood up to back King was Rep. Louie Gohmert, R-Texas, who argued that King had denounced the kind of language he discussed to the New York Times last week. King did not attend the meeting, according to multiple House GOP members.

According to Rep. Steve Stivers, R-Ohio, McCarthy received a "big applause" when the issue came up Tuesday morning.

"It proves that he's willing to do hard things and willing to set a moral compass for our conference, and I think that's a good thing," Stivers said.

According to another House Republican, members had become fed up with King's act, which had become the hot topic on Capitol Hill Monday along with the ongoing partial government shutdown. The latest comments were the straw the broke the camel's back, to many GOP lawmakers.

The New York Times reported King said in an interview, "White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization — how did that language become offensive?" King said the quote was taken out of context and that he was only referring to Western civilization when he asked, "how did that language become offensive?"

But many Republicans said enough was enough.

"Even people who were willing to look the other way and give him the benefit of the doubt in the past are outraged by the comments that most view as pure racist," said one House Republican. "There's no way this was anything but racist at this point."

McCarthy's move also showed a new level of willingness to discipline Republicans since former House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., never took on King over his past comments. Stivers, who pulled National Republican Congressional Committee funding from King's re-election bid in 2018 and condemned remarks on white nationalism at the time, said that King is now on everyone's radar.

"Different people have different levels of tolerance, or it takes different levels to get their attention," Stivers said. "I think he has everybody's attention now."

Atop the list of those who got the message was McCarthy, who also indicated Monday night that he would support either a resolution to censure or reprimand the Iowa Republican.

"He's showing leadership. I think he'll be judged by whether it was the right or wrong decision by the conference, but you have to take a stand and he did on this one. It shows he's not looking to someone else," said Rep. Sean Duffy, R-Wis.

"He's at the tip of the spear making decisions that affect our conference," Duffy added.

Texto completo: President Donald Trump repeatedly expressed to senior White House aides his desire to withdraw from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, according to a report.
The military alliance created in the aftermath of World War II by the United States, Canada and some European nations has been viewed as a critical bedrock against Soviet and Russian aggression for decades. But Trump has long balked at the U. S. 's NATO allies for not spending more on defense and meeting funding commitments.
The revelation that the president did not see the point of the alliance and discussed withdrawing from it last year, reported in the New York Times on Monday evening, comes amid allegations that Trump deliberately concealed details of his meetings with Russian President Vladimir Putin, even from his own aides. It also comes amid a separate Times report that the FBI launched an investigation into Trump's administration over whether he was secretly working on behalf of the Russians.
A weakened NATO is one of Putin's major geopolitical goals and fears of its eastward expansion is one of the reasons often cited for Russia's seizure of Ukraine's Crimea.
The White House said that while Trump has publicly raised complaints about NATO, he seems satisfied with the way things stand now. It also pointed to statements he made in July in which he said NATO was "very important. "
Trump's strong aversion to international alliances and organizations is well documented. He pulled the U. S. out of the Paris climate change accord and exited a sweeping trade pact with Asian nations, as well as a deal related to Iran's nuclear weapons program.
Trump has previously, publicly appeared to threaten to withdraw the U. S. from NATO if allies don't boost military spending. He has accused key NATO partners of being freeloaders and described the alliance as "obsolete. "
"I think it's the most insulting thing I’ve ever been asked," Trump replied in a TV interview when asked about the FBI's probe. "I think it's the most insulting article I’ve ever had written. And if you read the article, you'd see they found absolutely nothing. "
NATO was founded in 1949 and has 29 members. All have agreed to spend 2 percent of their gross domestic product on defense by 2024. The alliance has estimated that based on current trends only half of NATO members will reach this target.
"It doesn't get much worse than this," Carl Bildt, a Swedish diplomat and former prime minister, tweeted Tuesday reacting to Trump's reported NATO discussions.
NATO was was founded on the principle of collective defense, meaning if one NATO ally is attacked, all NATO allies are attacked. In recent years, NATO forces have been deployed to Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland to act as a bulwark against Russian territorial hostility. They also help combat terrorism in Afghanistan, commercial piracy off the Horn of Africa and address global migration-related issues.

Texto completo: A bombshell report in the New York Times this weekend said that the FBI in 2017 began investigating whether President Trump, wittingly or unwittingly, had been working on behalf of Russia against American interests.
Washington Post columnist Max Boot has compiled 18 reasons Trump could be a Russian “asset." The Post also reported over the weekend on Trump's extraordinary efforts to conceal details of his conversations with Ruissan President Vladimir Putin.
It remains to be seen whether Trump is working for the Kremlin. The Times reported that it's unclear whether special counsel Robert Mueller, who is probing ties between the Trump campaign and Russia, is still pursuing the counterintelligence investigation in addition to his criminal investigation.
After initially dodging, Trump said Monday, “I never worked for Russia" and called the idea a “whole big fat hoax."
The much-anticipated Mueller report may answer all the questions. But one thing's for sure: The latest news reports have overshadowed the innocent (though not necessarily flattering) explanations that have been advanced in the past for Trump's unusual affinity for Putin and Russia, a key mystery of his presidency.
Here's a second look a some of the theories that have been floated by commentators, with the caveat that hindsight is 20-20 vision and they didn't have the benefit of knowing the latest developments when they wrote their articles:
Trump has an ideological affinity for dictators and their worldview Trump has an authoritarian bent and likes such rulers, according to this theory. New York Times columnist Ross Douthat, in a July 2018 op-ed piece, said, “We have ample evidence, going back decades, that Trump simply likes authoritarian rulers, that he admires their supposed toughness and doesn't give a fig about their cruelty, that he thinks they would make more reliable allies and partners for the United States than the ingrate democracies of Western Europe."
(Douthat considered “Trump being Trump" the most likely explanation for Trump's Russia-related behavior, but also discussed other options, including the theory that Trump was a Russian asset.)
Andrew Sullivan wrote in New York magazine in July 2018 that Trump is “the kind of person who thinks that the mafia boss at the back table is the coolest guy in the room. This is why he has such a soft spot for Russia. Its kleptocratic elites see the world in just the same way."
Trump likes Putin and the Russians personally Douthat noted, “We also have ample evidence that he likes people who seem to like him and considers anyone who criticizes him an enemy: 'Thus, the Euros are bastards, and [Chinese President Xi Jinping, North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un, and Putin] are not bad guys."'
Bill Schneider, a professor at George Mason University, in a July 2018 column for NBC News wrote, “Trump is a narcissist, a man with boundless self-regard. With a narcissist, flattery will get you everywhere. And Putin, as a former KGB agent and master manipulator, certainly knows how to flatter."
Josh Marshall suggested in Talking Points Memo just a few months into Trump's presidency that Trump did business with Russians, associated with them, and started thinking the way they did. Not only that, Trump stubbornly believes “what Donald Trump thinks is right." By 2015, Marshall suggested, “this gets you to a pretty clear storyline: Sanctions wrong; Russia good; Putin good; Putin strong."
Trump can't stand having his legitimacy questioned Under this theory, if Trump took a harsher tone on Russia and admitted that the Russians meddled in the elections and helped him get elected, he would be acknowledging that there's a question mark over his legitimacy as president.
“His vanity and amour propre, joined to his rage against his doubters, makes it impossible for Trump to admit that anyone else helped him win the White House — so he cannot bring himself to fully acknowledge and criticize Russian election meddling because to do so might call into question not only his legitimacy but his self-conception as a political grandmaster," Douthat wrote.
“He thinks that any attention to Russian meddling in the 2016 election detracts from the glory of his victory," Ramesh Ponnuru suggested in a Bloomberg Opnion column in July 2018.
Trump is so stubborn he can't change his tune on Russia This theory holds that Trump feels like he can't back down from his views on Russia because it will show weakness.
“Given Trump's affection for authoritarian leaders and fixation on projecting strength, the simplest explanation for Trump's refusal to criticize Putin might be that he doesn't want to give the impression that he has been cowed into changing his view. Perhaps he's thinking that if he allows his critics to troll him into offering harsh words, it would show that they are stronger than him—and if he acknowledges Russian interference in the election, it undermines the legitimacy of his victory in 2016," David A. Graham suggested in the Atlantic in August 2017.

WASHINGTON - The House Republican leader said Sunday he will meet with Rep. Steve King this week to discuss King's future and role in the party and promised action following the Iowa congressman's recent comments in defense of white supremacy.
"That language has no place in America. That is not the America I know and it's most definitely not the party of Lincoln," said House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif. "Action will be taken. I'm having a serious conversation with congressman Steve King."
King was quoted in the New York Times last week as saying, "White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization - how did that language become offensive?" King has insisted he is an advocate for "Western civilization," not white supremacy or white nationalism. He said it was a "mistake" to use phrasing that "created an unnecessary controversy" and denied being racist.
McCarthy, who appeared on CBS' "Face the Nation," told host Margaret Brennan after the cameras were turned off that he is reviewing whether King, now serving his ninth term, should keep his committee assignments, according to CBS' transcript of the broadcast.
Passenger gets gun past TSA checkpoint
A passenger made it through a Transportation Security Administration checkpoint with a gun on Jan. 2, boarding a Delta Air Lines flight from Atlanta Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport and flying to Tokyo, authorities said Sunday.
"TSA has determined standard procedures were not followed and a passenger did in fact pass through a standard screening TSA checkpoint with a firearm," the agency said Sunday. "TSA has held those responsible appropriately accountable."
Delta said the passenger brought the gun on Flight DL 295, and as soon as the passenger reported carrying the firearm, the airline disclosed the offense to the TSA.
The agency said the passenger was cooperative and "was met by Japanese authorities upon landing."

Hello, It's Erin Griffith, reporting, happily, from my home base in San Francisco and not the carnival of virtual assistants, shiny screens, crowded smart homes and greasy VR demos in Las Vegas. Our correspondents made the CES maze of gadgets look almost fun, which anyone who has been there before knows is an impressive feat.
Back in the land of magical, billion-dollar start-up unicorns, things have been quieter, thanks to the federal government shutdown. No Securities and Exchange Commission means no progress on initial public offering plans of the larger start-ups, including Uber and Lyft.
Any other time in the last five years, this would not have mattered. The unicorns have been putting off their public market debuts for as long as possible -- what's another month or two? But a volatile stock market and signs of a possible recession have fostered a creeping sense of panic.
As The Times reported in December, Uber and Lyft already accelerated their I.P.O. plans to try to get ahead of a potential market shift. This week, Dara Khosrowshahi, chief executive of Uber, tempered expectations, telling The Wall Street Journal that market turbulence was not likely to affect the company's plans, but "if it doesn't happen, it doesn't happen."
Uber shareholders would most likely be disappointed if the company does not go public in the coming year, he added.
The shutdown, volatility and recession fears are happening at a crucial moment. The start-up world's success hinges, in part, on its ability to use hype and "trust me" confidence to persuade people to believe in a vision of the future. It's easy to get caught up in the narrative of innovation, disruption and rising valuations (and ignore the lack of profits).
But not everyone has, and skeptics are getting louder. Chamath Palihapitiya, a prominent venture capital investor, recently called the entire start-up and venture capital system a "charade" and "an enormous multivariate kind of Ponzi scheme."
He's right in one sense: A Ponzi scheme relies on its creator's ability to persuade ever-larger crowds to buy into his or her vision. Same goes for start-ups that haven't proved they're able to turn a profit. A flash of doubt, especially among public-market investors, could spiral into a broader questioning of the entire start-up ecosystem.
For the largest, most valuable start-ups in Silicon Valley, many of which plan to prove themselves and their unprofitable business models to the world by going public, there could not be a worse moment for that to happen. If Uber can't go public, what does it mean for all the "Uber for X" companies that followed its lead?
Cracks are beginning to show. This week, two high-flying start-ups experienced a reality check in their fund-raising. WeWork sought to raise $16 billion in new funding from SoftBank, its main backer. The company wound up raising just $2 billion -- still an enormous pile of cash, but a steep step down from its original plan.
And Bird, a two-year-old scooter company that was so sought-after by investors last summer that they doubled the company's valuation in just a few weeks, is now raising funding at a flat valuation, according to Axios.
Some venture capital investors say they welcome a downturn, as I wrote this week. They're hoarding cash and making "downturn lists" of companies to invest in once valuations become more reasonable. And some companies have seen the venture-fueled madness and decided it's not for them.
Elsewhere this week:
■ Economists and investors are clashing over the health of the American economy. No one is debating the health of the Chinese economy, with concerns spreading to non-tech companies including Ford, FedEx, Starbucks and Tiffany, Matt Phillips writes.
■ Apple's biggest issue is not the Chinese economy, it's that people like the columnist Kevin Roose's mother don't feel the need to replace their phones every two years anymore.
■ That may explain the surprising news from CES that Apple struck deals with a number of hardware companies, including Vizio, Samsung, Sony and LG, to use its software. The deals -- something the company has resisted in the past -- show Apple's ambition to make more money from content and services, as sales of its cash cow, the iPhone, slow down, Brian X. Chen writes.
■ When the government asked Palantir and Oracle to share the number of women and minorities it employs, the companies tried to hide the numbers, citing them as "trade secrets." According to a report from Reveal News, the numbers are abysmal. (Palantir has no female executives and just one female manager.) The publication sued to obtain the letters the companies sent justifying their privacy around the issue. The Palantir letter cited fears that competitors would steal their lone female manager.
Each week, technology reporters and columnists from The New York Times review the week's news, offering analysis and maybe a joke or two about the most important developments in the tech industry.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

How long can O'Rourke wait as 2020 pace picks up?
You won't see Beto O'Rourke announce whether he's running for president in 2020 for a while. But you may see him do almost anything else in the meantime.
"So, I'm here at the dentist," the former Democratic congressman said with a giggle during a teeth-cleaning seen live on Instagram last week, before quizzing the dental hygienist about life along the US-Mexico border.
Voters can catch O'Rourke on more traditional airwaves next month in New York, when Oprah Winfrey interviews him.
He barged into last year's Senate race almost laughably early, in March 2017, insisting he was a credible contender against the incumbent, Republican Ted Cruz, when almost no one nationally knew of O'Rourke. Now he's doing almost anything to keep people paying attention to him without formally starting a presidential campaign for 2020. He's not expected to decide until next month at the earliest whether he's running.
These days, that counts as playing hard to get. Influential activists in Iowa and elsewhere are clamoring for him to get in the race, while some potential rivals move their timelines earlier. So far, interest in O'Rourke has held after his near upset of Cruz, but for how much longer?
"They're not going to wait forever," Mark Jones, a political science professor at Rice University in Houston, said of Democratic campaign operatives, donors, activists and fellow politicians looking to pick sides or offer endorsements. "The more candidates who start to formally launch their candidacies, the greater the pressure will rise on Beto."
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren announced on New Year's Eve that she'd formed a presidential exploratory committee, hoping to get an early jump on people such as O'Rourke, former Vice President Joe Biden, and Senators Corey Booker of New Jersey, Bernie Sanders of Vermont, and Kamala Harris of California.
Julian Castro, housing chief under President Barack Obama, kicked off his campaign Saturday and could appeal to the same Hispanic community that O'Rourke may count on as a bilingual native of the border city of El Paso.

Trump says 'weak' Biden came off the 'trash heap'
President Trump called former Vice President Joe Biden a "weak" man when asked Saturday night about a growing list of Democrats seeking to topple him in 2020.
Trump, who prizes strength, attacks his enemies as weak, and has often resorted to name calling, resurrected previous insults against Biden as the former US senator from Delaware mulls his third presidential bid. He mocked Biden's two unsuccessful attempts for the White House and said former President Obama "took him off the trash heap" when he tapped Biden to be his vice president.
"He's weak. So we'll see what happens with him . . . Whoever it is, I think we're going to do just fine," Trump told Fox News's Jeanine Pirro.
Biden's spokesman declined to comment.
Trump made similar comments about Biden during an interview with CBS News in July, when he said that running against the former vice president would be a "dream."
Biden, 76, unsuccessfully sought the presidential nomination in 1988 and 2008.
Biden has previously taken a stab at Trump.
During a December interview with author and television personality Bruce Feiler, Biden acknowledged his reputation as a "gaffe machine" — a "wonderful" quality "compared to a guy who can't tell the truth."

Julián Castro says Trump has created a tragedy at border
2020 presidential contender Julián Castro said Sunday that President Trump has created a "tragedy at the border" with immigration policies that have separated children from their families.
Castro, a former San Antonio mayor and Obama administration housing secretary, promised to overhaul immigration laws when he announced his candidacy on Saturday. On Sunday, he slammed Trump for "playing games" with people's right to seek asylum and said the nation needs to get serious about recognizing this right.
"I don't believe that we should have family detention for people that are seeking asylum or refugee status solely," Castro said on CBS News's "Face the Nation." "We should develop other ways to ensure that people are processed and we're able to keep track of them in the country."
Castro said that as an alternative to deportation, he would "look at things like ankle monitors" to track where individuals are in the United States.
The Obama administration piloted such a program in 2016, but it was ended by the Trump administration, NBC News said.
If elected, Castro would be the country's first Latino president. He announced his plans to join the field of Democrats running for the party's 2020 nomination in San Antonio on Saturday. He laid out a platform that included making the first two years of college affordable, expanding Medicare to all Americans, and creating universal prekindergarten.
When pressed on how he would appeal to centrist Democrats with a largely progressive platform, Castro focused on health care.

Texto completo: Global warming isn't only cooking our atmosphere, it's also heating up the oceans.
The world's seas were the warmest on record in 2018, scientists announced last week. Also, ocean temperatures are rising faster than previously thought, a new paper said.
Specifically, they're warming as much as 40 percent faster than an estimate from a United Nations panel just five years ago.
"If you want to see where global warming is happening, look in our oceans," paper co-author Zeke Hausfather said in a statement. "Ocean heating is a very important indicator of climate change, and we have robust evidence that it is warming more rapidly than we thought," said Hausfather, a climate scientist with Carbon Brief, a British-based website that covers climate science news.
He also said that while 2018 was the fourth-warmest year on record in the atmosphere, it was the warmest year on record in the oceans, as was 2017 and 2016 before that. In fact, Hausfather told Reuters, records for ocean warming have been broken almost yearly since 2000.
Overall, while we're rightly concerned about what climate change is doing to our atmosphere, ocean heating is critical because an estimated 93 percent of all heat trapped by greenhouse gases settles in the world's oceans.
Global warming is caused by humanity's burning of fossil fuels such as oil, gas and coal, which release greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane into the earth's atmosphere and oceans.
"Global warming is here, and has major consequences already. There is no doubt, none!" the paper's authors wrote.
The analysis also shows that trends in ocean heat content match those predicted by top computer models.
Laure Zanna, an associate professor of climate physics at the University of Oxford who was not involved in the study, told The New York Times that the research was "a very nice summary of what we know of the ocean and how far the new estimates have come together."
The unusual warmth in the seas is harming marine life and coral reefs. It's also contributing to rising sea levels around the world as ice melts near Antarctica and Greenland.
The research was published Thursday in a "Perspectives" paper in the peer-reviewed journal Science.
Ocean temperatures are rising faster than previously thought, with dire implications for coral reefs and other marine life.

Texto completo: "He was a Crooked Cop who is being totally protected
by his best friend, Bob Mueller, & the 13 Angry Democrats..."
President Donald Trump, on James Comey
President Donald Trump, in response to reports that the FBI began an investigation of him last year to find out whether he had a clandestine agenda to help Russia, said Saturday that former FBI Director James Comey and other "losers" at the bureau "tried to do a number on your President."
He called Comey a "total sleaze" and "crooked cop." The president also took swipes at special counsel Robert Mueller and T he New York Times, which broke the story Friday night. "My firing of James Comey was a great day for America," he tweeted.
Comey responded Saturday morning in a tweet that quoted President Franklin D. Roosevelt: "I ask you to judge me by the enemies I have made."
The newspaper said the decision to investigate Trump himself was an aggressive move by FBI officials confronting the chaotic aftermath of the firing of Comey and enduring the president's verbal assaults on the Russia investigation as a "witch hunt."
CNN reported that counterintelligence agents were investigating why Trump was acting in ways that seemed to benefit Russia.
Both news organizations said Trump's firing of Comey was a major factor prompting the FBI to take action.
Although the report was published Friday night and prompted a sharp response from White House press secretary Sarah Sanders, Trump did not weigh in until 7:05 a.m Saturday.
"Wow, just learned in the Failing New York Times that the corrupt former leaders of the FBI, almost all fired or forced to leave the agency for some very bad reasons, opened up an investigation on me, for no reason & with no proof, after I fired Lyin' James Comey, a total sleaze!
In a series of tweets, he said the FBI was in "complete turmoil" at the time because of Comey's "poor leadership" and his handling of an investigation of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.
"My firing of James Comey was a great day for America," Trump tweeted. "He was a Crooked Cop who is being totally protected by his best friend, Bob Mueller, & the 13 Angry Democrats..."
He singled out several FBI agents in his five-part tweetstorm.
"Lyin' James Comey, Andrew McCabe, Peter S and his lover, agent Lisa Page, & more, all disgraced and/or fired and caught in the act. These are just some of the losers that tried to do a number on your President," he tweeted. "Part of the Witch Hunt. Remember the 'insurance policy?' This is it!"
Trump was referring to charges that some FBI agents, among them McCabe, Peter Strzok and Page, a colleague Strzok was intimately involved with, were part of a conspiracy to undermine the president.
Addressing the Russia aspect of the Times report, Trump said he had been "FAR tougher on Russia than Obama, Bush or Clinton. Maybe tougher than any other President."
He repeated his long-held contention that "getting along with Russia is a good thing, not a bad thing."
Sanders said in her statement Friday night that Comey was fired for just cause and that Trump has never favored Russia.
"This is absurd. James Comey was fired because he's a disgraced partisan hack, and his Deputy Andrew McCabe, who was in charge at the time, is a known liar fired by the FBI. Unlike President Obama, who let Russia and other foreign adversaries push America around, President Trump has actually been tough on Russia."
The obstruction probe was an idea the FBI had previously considered, but it didn't start until Comey was fired, CNN reported. The justification went beyond Trump's firing of Comey, CNN said, according to its sources, and included the president's conversation with Comey in the Oval Office asking him to drop the investigation into his former national security adviser Michael Flynn.
Trump insisted last year that he didn't fire Comey because of the Russia investigation, despite video and documentary evidence to the contrary, including an interview with NBC News.
"I was going to fire Comey knowing there was no good time to do it," he told NBC anchor Lester Holt. "And in fact, when I decided to just do it, I said to myself — I said, you know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story. It's an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election that they should've won."
"Not that it matters but I never fired James Comey because of Russia!" Trump tweeted shortly after the firing. "The Corrupt Mainstream Media loves to keep pushing that narrative, but they know it is not true!"
The FBI director's firing is central to an obstruction of justice investigation being conducted by Mueller, who is also looking into Russian attempts to influence the 2016 election ito help Trump.

The newspaper said the decision to investigate Trump himself was an aggressive move by FBI officials confronting the chaotic aftermath of the firing of Comey and enduring the president's verbal assaults on the Russia investigation as a "witch hunt."
CNN reported that counterintelligence agents were investigating why Trump was acting in ways that seemed to benefit Russia.
Both news organizations said Trump's firing of Comey was a major factor prompting the FBI to take action.
Although the report was published Friday night and prompted a sharp response from White House press secretary Sarah Sanders, Trump did not weigh in until 7:05 a.m Saturday.
"Wow, just learned in the Failing New York Times that the corrupt former leaders of the FBI, almost all fired or forced to leave the agency for some very bad reasons, opened up an investigation on me, for no reason & with no proof, after I fired Lyin' James Comey, a total sleaze!
In a series of tweets, he said the FBI was in "complete turmoil" at the time because of Comey's "poor leadership" and his handling of an investigation of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.
"My firing of James Comey was a great day for America," Trump tweeted. "He was a Crooked Cop who is being totally protected by his best friend, Bob Mueller, & the 13 Angry Democrats..."
He singled out several FBI agents in his five-part tweetstorm.
"Lyin' James Comey, Andrew McCabe, Peter S and his lover, agent Lisa Page, & more, all disgraced and/or fired and caught in the act. These are just some of the losers that tried to do a number on your President," he tweeted. "Part of the Witch Hunt. Remember the 'insurance policy?' This is it!"
Trump was referring to charges that some FBI agents, among them McCabe, Peter Strzok and Page, a colleague Strzok was intimately involved with, were part of a conspiracy to undermine the president.
Addressing the Russia aspect of the Times report, Trump said he had been "FAR tougher on Russia than Obama, Bush or Clinton. Maybe tougher than any other President."
He repeated his long-held contention that "getting along with Russia is a good thing, not a bad thing."
Sanders said in her statement Friday night that Comey was fired for just cause and that Trump has never favored Russia.
"This is absurd. James Comey was fired because he's a disgraced partisan hack, and his Deputy Andrew McCabe, who was in charge at the time, is a known liar fired by the FBI. Unlike President Obama, who let Russia and other foreign adversaries push America around, President Trump has actually been tough on Russia."
The obstruction probe was an idea the FBI had previously considered, but it didn't start until Comey was fired, CNN reported. The justification went beyond Trump's firing of Comey, CNN said, according to its sources, and included the president's conversation with Comey in the Oval Office asking him to drop the investigation into his former national security adviser Michael Flynn.
Trump insisted last year that he didn't fire Comey because of the Russia investigation, despite video and documentary evidence to the contrary, including an interview with NBC News.
"I was going to fire Comey knowing there was no good time to do it," he told NBC anchor Lester Holt. "And in fact, when I decided to just do it, I said to myself — I said, you know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story. It's an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election that they should've won."
"Not that it matters but I never fired James Comey because of Russia!" Trump tweeted shortly after the firing. "The Corrupt Mainstream Media loves to keep pushing that narrative, but they know it is not true!"
The FBI director's firing is central to an obstruction of justice investigation being conducted by Mueller, who is also looking into Russian attempts to influence the 2016 election ito help Trump.
"He was a Crooked Cop who is being totally protected
by his best friend, Bob Mueller, & the 13 Angry Democrats..."

Texto completo: Global warming isn't only cooking our atmosphere, it's also heating up the oceans.
The world's seas were the warmest on record in 2018, scientists announced last week. Also, ocean temperatures are rising faster than previously thought, a new paper said.
Specifically, they're warming as much as 40 percent faster than an estimate from a United Nations panel just five years ago.
"If you want to see where global warming is happening, look in our oceans," paper co-author Zeke Hausfather said in a statement. "Ocean heating is a very important indicator of climate change, and we have robust evidence that it is warming more rapidly than we thought," said Hausfather, a climate scientist with Carbon Brief, a British-based website that covers climate science news.
He also said that while 2018 was the fourth-warmest year on record in the atmosphere, it was the warmest year on record in the oceans, as was 2017 and 2016 before that. In fact, Hausfather told Reuters, records for ocean warming have been broken almost yearly since 2000.
Overall, while we're rightly concerned about what climate change is doing to our atmosphere, ocean heating is critical because an estimated 93 percent of all heat trapped by greenhouse gases settles in the world's oceans.
Global warming is caused by humanity's burning of fossil fuels such as oil, gas and coal, which release greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane into the earth's atmosphere and oceans.
"Global warming is here, and has major consequences already. There is no doubt, none!" the paper's authors wrote.
The analysis also shows that trends in ocean heat content match those predicted by top computer models.
Laure Zanna, an associate professor of climate physics at the University of Oxford who was not involved in the study, told The New York Times that the research was "a very nice summary of what we know of the ocean and how far the new estimates have come together."
The unusual warmth in the seas is harming marine life and coral reefs. It's also contributing to rising sea levels around the world as ice melts near Antarctica and Greenland.
The research was published Thursday in a "Perspectives" paper in the peer-reviewed journal Science.
Ocean temperatures are rising faster than previously thought, with dire implications for coral reefs and other marine life.

Texto completo: The shutdown is now the longest ever, with no end in sight
The partial government shutdown is now the longest in American history, with a fourth of the federal government still shuttered as the standoff enters a fourth week with no end in sight. The shutdown hit its 22nd day on Saturday, surpassing the 21-day record set in 1996 during the Clinton administration. Lawmakers won’t return to Washington until Monday, guaranteeing the government will remain partially closed at least through early this week.
Americans widely blame the shutdown on President Donald Trump, a new Washington Post-ABC News poll found. Trump's demands for border wall funding remain central to the prolonged shutdown, with Democrats doubting the effectiveness of a physical barrier. Last week, Mexican authorities uncovered a tunnel across from Arizona that they believe was used to smuggle drugs and people across the U. S. -Mexico border — the third such discovery in less than a month.
The FBI investigated whether Trump was secretly helping Russia, reports say
Federal counterintelligence agents began an investigation of Donald Trump last year that aimed to find out whether the president had a clandestine agenda to help Russia, the New York Times and CNN reported Friday. The revelation, which the White House called "absurd" in a late-evening statement, suggests the FBI felt Trump's firing of director James B. Comey in May 2017 was motivated by Russian interests and might constitute a threat to U. S. national security, the Times reported. Trump responded Saturday by insulting "losers" at the FBI and claiming that "getting along with Russia is a good thing, not a bad thing. "
Details emerge on Jayme Closs' accused kidnapper
The Wisconsin man accused of killing Denise and James Closs and kidnapping their 13-year-old daughter, Jayme, was described by former classmates as funny and intelligent – but seemingly indifferent. "He was just kind of there," one student said about Jake Thomas Patterson, 21, who was apprehended Thursday after Closs escaped from a home in Gordon, Wisconsin, where she was allegedly held by Patterson for 88 days. Police said Patterson's goal was to kidnap Jayme, not kill her parents. He is due to make his initial court appearance Monday. Meanwhile, Closs and her hometown of Barron now face the tough task of healing after the long ordeal.
Julián Castro is running for president
Julián Castro, a former Obama cabinet member and San Antonio mayor, officially threw his hat in the ring Saturday, announcing he would run for president. The Texas Democrat declared his White House bid from a stage in his hometown of San Antonio, making remarks in both English and Spanish. Castro, 44, may be the most well-known Latino in a race likely to revolve around immigration. He also rolled out his campaign slogan: "One Nation. One Destiny. " Castro is among four candidates so far who have taken steps toward or officially announced their candidacies.
Deadly winter storm roars east
A bitter winter storm dumped at least 10 inches of snow on St. Louis Saturday and left several dead in crashes on slick roadways before spreading eastward across the country. At least six deaths had been reported of Sunday, including three in Missouri, two in Kansas and one in Virginia. In Ohio, a Delta aircraft carrying 126 passengers and crew slid off the pavement on its way to the terminal. Thankfully, no injuries were reported. Nationwide, more than 600 flights have been canceled and another 913 delayed due to the storm. Sunday’s hardest-hit airports were those serving Washington, D. C. , where snow accumulations threatened to exceed the 4-8-inches forecasters initially called for. More than 35 million people from Ohio to the East Coast remained under winter storm advisories or warnings Sunday, the National Weather Service said.

THE SPECIAL MISOGYNY RESERVED FOR MOTHERS MOTHERHOOD IS THE MOST COMPLEX TOPIC I HAVE EVER COVERED, YET IT HAS BEEN TREATED AS NICHE AND UNIMPORTANT, EXPLAINS PODCASTER AND FORMER NPR REPORTER HILLARY FRANK

Texto completo: I'm one of the lucky ones in radio. Nobody called my voice whiny (at least not that I heard). Nobody accused me of uptalk or vocal fry - all the insults people tend to hurl at women in broadcasting. No editor told me my ideas were unrelatable. Sure, I had pieces killed, but my editors always explained the reason, and the reason made sense to me.
If you'd asked me back then if I was a feminist, I might've shrugged and said, "I don't know." To be honest, I thought the word was a bit of an insult.
In 2010, my luck changed. That's the year I became a mother.
My daughter arrived healthy, but I was injured so severely that I was unable to walk for two months. I spent eight solid weeks on an air mattress because I couldn't handle the stairs to the bedroom. Here I was with a baby - one I'd wanted very much - but I felt completely unable to care for her. The worst part was, I barely had anybody to talk to about it. Most of my friends hadn't had babies yet and I didn't want to scare them.
This is, in part, what led me to start working on a podcast about parenting called "The Longest Shortest Time." I've been making it for eight years now.
I have learned a lot. That parents can be civil with one another on the internet. That naming an episode "Boobs" will make it your most popular one ever. And that there is a special kind of misogyny reserved for mothers.
When I started the show, you couldn't make a living making a podcast, so I needed to get some episodes on the radio. I sent a sampling to my longtime editor at a big public radio station. He said he was into it but couldn't get the higher-ups to bite. "It's weird," he said sheepishly. "One of them said you sound like a little girl."
Even when I was a little girl, I didn't sound like a little girl. I listened to the clips again, trying to figure out what seemed little-girlish. The only answer I could come up with, the thing that set this work apart from my previous work, is that I - and the other women I was interviewing - sounded a little emotional. A little angry. A little raw. These are the qualities that supposedly make radio powerful. Was it being mothers that made us sound weak?
I met rejection after rejection. "We're just not sure there's enough of an audience for this kind of thing," an editor said. "This is just too . small," another said. One guy put it more bluntly: "Who would want to listen to this except for moms?"
So this bias was definitely about moms. But it's a really ignorant bias to have.
Let's just imagine it's true that only moms would ever want to listen to stories about moms. Hooray, you're in business. Moms are one of the most coveted demographics for advertisers.
But it's also nonsense to say that stories about moms are not relatable. I don't hear anyone fretting over whether "99 Percent Invisible" listeners are all architects or "Radiolab" listeners are all scientists. In story-based reporting, this is what we do: We take the specific and we present it in a compelling way, to make other humans connect with it.
I made the show for three years - and raised tens of thousands of dollars on Kickstarter - before big shops got interested. Eventually I was picked up by WNYC and then Stitcher. In the past few years, motherhood has become a boom market, with publishers churning out books on the complicated realities of pregnancy, life with kids, or choosing not to have them at all. But back then, many of the concerns of motherhood still seemed unpopular, if not downright taboo.
In 2015, I wanted to do an episode about childbirth injuries that I could also pitch to a network radio show. Most of these injuries can be remedied by pelvic floor physical therapy, but doctors rarely recommend it, or even know about it. I wanted to investigate why so many moms were living with pelvic pain for months - years, even - after giving birth, resigned to painful sex or no sex at all.
When I pitched a public radio editor, she told me it was an interesting topic but that you just can't talk about something that sexually explicit on the air. I brought the story to another radio editor, this time with an economic peg. I told him the question I wanted to ask was: What is the cost of saving a mom's sex life?
He told me he wouldn't commission the story because the answer to why we don't prioritize pain-free sex is that sex is extra. It's not essential.
And yet, if you type "erectile" into the search bar on NPR's website, you get a plethora of results. In 1998, we learned about the new popularity of Viagra, the "magic pill for impotence." In 2008, NPR assessed a decade of Viagra. And in 2014, we got "Love and Sex in the Time of Viagra - 16 Years On." In between, dozens of pieces mention erectile dysfunction.
When you talk about male sexual dysfunction, you're talking about problems with arousal. When you talk about childbirth injuries, you're talking about problems with chronic pain. From a health perspective, one talk seems much more essential than the other. And it doesn't involve discussing boners.
NPR. It has driven me to feminism.
Motherhood is the biggest, most complex topic I have ever reported on. I've had the honor of interviewing a pregnant transgender man, a mixed-race kid who schools her white mom on what it means to be black via freestyle rap, and Terry Gross of "Fresh Air" on why she chose not to have children. And yet it has been treated as small, niche and unimportant, and covering it has changed how I am treated by my colleagues.
The only time I've been sexually harassed at work happened a few years ago, when an award-winning producer I had never met drunkenly approached me at a hotel bar during a conference.
"I know you," he said. "You're the baby lady."
"I guess," I said.
He shouted gleefully, "I'm going to give you a baby!"
"I already have one of those," I said, backing away.
"No," he yelled in my face, "I'm going to give you a baby tonight! I'm going to take you upstairs and give you a baby tonight!"
Fortunately, a few of his co-workers pulled him off me and I ran away.
In this guy's eyes, I wasn't a radio maker; I was a baby maker.
A while back, I was interviewed for another podcast. When I declined to answer some personal questions about my parenting life, the host challenged me. He suggested that people might expect to hear from me about why I had only one child, for example, because I was one of the most prominent moms out there.
What I wish I'd said back is, "No, I'm one of the most prominent podcasters."
Hillary Frank is the creator of the podcast "The Longest Shortest Time" and the author, most recently, of "Weird Parenting Wins: Bathtub Dining, Family Screams, and Other Hacks From the Parenting Trenches." She wrote this for The New York Times.

Texto completo: MANCHESTER, N.H. — Elizabeth Warren courted hundreds of New Hampshire voters Saturday, kissing babies and introducing her golden retriever, Bailey, to a crowd at a community college, while polishing her populist message of taking on Washington on behalf of the working class.
“This is our moment in history," Warren said.
Meanwhile, a handful of Bernie Sanders' core supporters gathered in Nashua Saturday afternoon to encourage him to seize the moment, as well — before he gets eclipsed by Warren.
“In his silence I am worried that some faux progressive will be the nominee and define our issues to the right," said New Hampshire state Representative Mark King, a Democrat who hosted about 10 people as part of a nationwide “Organizing for Bernie" event to persuade the 77-year-old senator from Vermont to run.
Warren's early campaign launch has given her a few precious days alone in the spotlight to sell a populist economic message to primary voters, particularly progressives who had supported Sanders in 2016. And nowhere is that edge more important than in New Hampshire, where expectations for Warren are sky high, and competition from her ideological fellow traveler and New England neighbor will be particularly fierce should Sanders decide to run.
“I'm here because I have to decide between the two of them," said Jessi Hull, a 2016 Sanders supporter from New Boston who wore a “She Persisted" T-shirt to a Warren event. “She's certainly a strong candidate in my heart right now."
Asked how she would distinguish herself from Sanders in the state, Warren said she was not a “professional politician," and had campaigned to change government for the benefit of working families long before being elected senator in Massachusetts in 2012.
“You know, this is my life's work," Warren said. “And I just didn't see any point in waiting. We need to be in this fight and we need to be committed to this fight."
Sanders has a significant edge in New Hampshire: He won the 2016 primary here with 60 percent of the vote against Hillary Clinton, continues to top the likely Democratic field in polls, and retains a loyal network of local organizers. But Warren, whose message of a middle class under attack by greedy corporate interests significantly overlaps with Sanders', also has an advantage, for now, at least: She's actually running.
“The decision to launch on Dec. 31 may go down in history as accidentally brilliant," said Adam Green, cofounder of the pro-Warren Progressive Change Campaign Committee political group. “It gave her a week-plus of having the lane to herself."
The stakes are high for her to perform well in a neighboring state that serves as an important early hurdle for presidential candidates. On Saturday, Warren greeted the crowd as her “neighbors" and joked that when she talks about a housing proposal before a New Hampshire audience, she is also expected to discuss how to pay for it.
“I do think because she is competing for a lot of the same voters that Bernie Sanders has that it was smart to get in early," said Jim Demers, a longtime Democratic operative in New Hampshire who's backing Senator Cory Booker. “I'm a total believer that New Hampshire is a do-or-die state for both of them and only one can live and only one will die from the New Hampshire primary."
The generally positive reaction among progressives so far has helped Warren reset after being criticized for touting a DNA test that showed distant Native American ancestry. A week ago in Iowa, she drew large, enthusiastic crowds to multiple venues, including in the eastern part of the state where Sanders ran well.
Already, she's made inroads among the community of activists that powers early campaigns. In Iowa, for example, Warren snagged Sanders' former state caucus director for her staff there, a warning to the Sanders world that key players will get poached the longer he stays out.
And she recently topped a straw poll the progressive group The Daily Kos conducted, with 22 percent of the vote. Sanders, dogged by recent reports that female members of his 2016 campaign staff were harassed or mistreated, came up a distant fifth, with just 11 percent.
“He can't play the 'I'm more progressive than thou' card in this field, so he's got nowhere to go but down, as other candidates become better known," the Daily Kos wrote of Sanders' poor showing.
While Warren doesn't have Sanders' national network, hitting the trail before him allows her to make her populist pitch on her own terms and prove she's capable of carrying the progressive mantle in 2020.
Subtract the personal story about growing up working class in Oklahoma, and Warren's announcement video, former Obama adviser David Axelrod told the Globe, “could have been a Bernie Sanders video."
But the benefits of owning that populist mantle early go beyond Sanders in a crowded field of Democrats.
An adviser to liberal billionaire Tom Steyer cited Warren's early messaging while explaining his decision last week not to run for president, according to The New York Times; Steyer felt Warren already commanded the message that he would have run on.
New Hampshire Democratic Party chairman Ray Buckley said Warren's rollout was “extraordinarily well done," but he doesn't believe she puts pressure on Sanders, who ran strong among New Hampshire's large bloc of independent voters.
“Bernie has such a foundation of support both here in New Hampshire and across the country that he can decide whenever he chooses to make a decision," Buckley said. “He has his own timetable."
At the national level, Sanders' supporters acknowledged they are eager for him to decide.
“People want to get going," said Jim Zogby, a board member of the pro-Sanders Our Revolution political group.
But he said Bernieworld isn't threatened by Warren.
“She's the flavor right now and there will be others who will be flavors who come along," Zogby said, but Sanders' “flavor was tried and liked by too many people for it to hurt him if he comes out a week or a month or two months from now."
Sanders, for his part, has not said when he will make a decision — only that he will run if he concludes he is the best candidate to defeat President Trump.
“I think the readings he wants to take are not among politicians but among voters out there and his sense of where the Democratic Party in the country is," said Mark Longabaugh, a former adviser to the senator.

Texto completo: Art: Primal Animals in Acrylic and Wood
Through March 29; folkartmuseum.org .
There's an amazing little wooden tiger in the American Folk Art Museum's teaching collection. Made around 1980 in Oaxaca by Manuel Jimenez, the piece is at once so simply shaped and so brightly painted that it comes across less as a depiction of any specific animal than as a vivid realization of the very idea of tigerness.
Starting Jan. 16, you'll be able to visit it, along with a spotted pig, a yellow fox and a green dog, in the lobby of the Citigroup Building in Long Island City as part of "A Kingdom in Pieces," where they'll be keeping company with contemporary animal-focused paintings by artists associated with the nearby Fountain House Gallery.

Pop Music: Dreamy Sounds From Japanese Breakfast
January 17 and 18; bowerypresents.com.
There's a comforting nostalgia to much of the music by Japanese Breakfast, the solo project of the singer-songwriter Michelle Zauner. Her polished sophomore album, "Soft Sounds From Another Planet," is a lush, sweet take on '90s shoegaze and dream pop, with hazy layers of reverb-heavy guitar and synths that give her music an organic-sounding richness.
But her retro aesthetic sounds fresh, in part thanks to its sharp songwriting and focus on contemporary anxieties. The soothing vibe belies the familiar existential dread in the poetic lyrics. "All of our celebrities keep dying/While the cruel men continue to win," Zauner sings in "Till Death," a song she has said is about love.
The music, which can be heard live during Zauner's two-night run at Brooklyn Steel, rewards those who pay close attention. Even her artist name is a way to distinguish who's a true fan and who's just along for the ride: She's Korean-American, not Japanese, and has made her relationship with her identity an important part of her work. As she told Teen Vogue last year, "I think that right now there are a lot of young kids that are pushing marginalized voices to the front, and I think I feel kind of a part of that." NATALIE WEINER
Theater: Labyrinth's Barn Series at Cherry Lane
Through Jan. 20, labtheater.org .
There are new works, and then there are scripts so fresh from the playwright's fingertips that they reach the stage with no time for rehearsal. That's what happened last year at Labyrinth Theater Company's Barn Series, a festival of new-play readings, the night that the Pulitzer Prize winner Stephen Adly Guirgis presented some fragments of a work in progress.
In the minutes before the reading, from his adaptation of the movie "Dog Day Afternoon," Guirgis stood onstage with a dozen actors, quietly explaining to each of them who they were playing and the circumstances of their scenes. The resulting performance was exhilarating -- huge energy packed into the tiny studio space at the Cherry Lane Theater in Greenwich Village, where the free festival is back this week.
Elizabeth Canavan's "Ladies in Waiting," Brett C. Leonard's "Papo" and Mariana Carreño King's "The Red Gene" are among the plays in this year's series, which wraps up Jan. 20 with three Guirgis works. One of the plays will get a full Labyrinth production this summer. LAURA COLLINS-HUGHES
Dance: Cuba Festival 2019
Through Jan. 20; joyce.org.
In the winter, live dance warms you up. The Joyce Theater provides some necessary heat with its Cuba Festival 2019, which features two returning groups. Malpaso Dance Company (through Jan. 13) presents works by Ohad Naharin, Merce Cunningham and up-and-coming Cuban choreographers, while Compañía Irene Rodríguez (Jan. 18-20) offers "Mas Que Flamenco," a program of short pieces.
Wedged in between is the United States debut of the intriguingly named contemporary company Los Hijos del Director, or The Children of the Director (Jan. 15-16). In "The Last Resource," choreographed by George Céspedes, who formed the troupe in Havana in 2013, dancers explore the obstacles that Cubans face. Alienation, uncertainty, change -- it's starting to sound all too familiar, in or out of Cuba. But this work, with music ranging from heavy metal and electronica to pieces by Cuban singer-songwriters, promises to be anything but. GIA KOURLAS

TV: Victoria, Albert and the First Royal Wedding
Jan. 13 and 20; pbs.org .
Charles and Diana. William and Kate. Harry and Meghan. But without Victoria and Albert, that phenomenon forever after known as the royal wedding might not exist.
In "Victoria & Albert: The Wedding," airing on Sundays, Jan. 13 and 20, on PBS (check local listings), the British historian Lucy Worsley breathlessly details the first cousins' path to the altar: the conspiracy to marry them from their births and their fizzled introduction on her 17th birthday (he was plump and had dreadful diarrhea; she liked her gift of a parrot more). Then came their second meeting, when Albert, by then a frog transformed, ignited in the young queen a sensation of "pure, beautiful, gobsmacking love," as one expert puts it. Get that girl her fan.
Worsley then reimagines their 1840 nuptials, devised as the P.R. coup of the century -- the better to herald the modern constitutional monarchy -- down to Victoria's white wedding dress, which popularized the color for brides, and a breakfast feast resplendent with skinned hares, taxidermied pigeons (adorning pigeon pies) and a 300-pound fruitcake.
The pomp and passion continues as Season 3 of "Victoria," also starting Jan. 13, finds revolution sweeping across Europe -- and the plucky monarch (Jenna Coleman) confronting a crisis that could end her reign. KATHRYN SHATTUCK

Film: Coming of Age, Later in Life, in 'The Heiresses'
Jan. 16; filmforum.com .
Chela (Ana Brun) and Chiquita (Margarita Irún), the descendants of wealthy families in Asunción, Paraguay, have been partners for 30 years. But in the first frames of "The Heiresses" -- opening Jan. 16 at the Film Forum and coming to theaters in other major cities -- strangers rifle through their once-opulent apartment as the couple sell off cherished belongings now that their money has run out.
So, apparently, has their luck: Chiquita has been accused of fraud and sent to prison, leaving Chela mired in loneliness and encroaching poverty. When a gossipy older neighbor (María Martins) asks Chela for a lift to her card game, she reluctantly begins a sort of taxi service, finding an unfamiliar freedom behind the wheel of her vintage Mercedes. Then Angy (Ana Ivanova) -- younger, brash, sexy -- climbs into the passenger seat. And something in Chela stirs.
Brun, in a fine debut, won the Silver Bear for best actress at the 2018 Berlin Film Festival. And the director Marcelo Martinessi, who says he was inspired by the romance between Paraguay's petite bourgeoisie and authoritarian regimes, captured the Alfred Bauer Prize for a feature "that opens new perspectives."

Classical Music: Reimagining Josephine Baker's Songs
Jan. 16-17; metmuseum.org .
The soprano Julia Bullock is in the midst of a hotly anticipated and now widely celebrated five-event residency at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, where she has already performed traditional slave songs, settings of poetry by Langston Hughes, a new version of John Adams's oratorio "El Niño," and a bevy of other contemporary works.
On Wednesday and Thursday at the Met, she will inhabit the part of Josephine Baker in composer Tyshawn Sorey's "Perle Noire: Meditations for Joséphine." Described by The New York Times upon its 2016 debut as "one of the most important works of art yet to emerge from the era of Black Lives Matter," the work melancholically reimagines songs by this complex icon, with texts by the poet Claudia Rankine. It has continued to evolve in performances by Bullock and the International Contemporary Ensemble, and remains powerfully relevant. As Sorey told The Times, "The lyrical content is timeless, and I wanted to create something musically to reflect what we're experiencing now." WILLIAM ROBIN

She Taped Her Boss's Lewd Call. Guess Who Was Fired and Sent to Jail?

Texto completo: LABUAPI, Indonesia -- The high school bookkeeper, Nuril Maknun, faced constant harassment from her boss, the principal.
At school, he often described his sex life and pressured her to have an affair. After work, he would call her and continue his obscene monologues.
"That kind of conversation happened so often I couldn't even count," Ms. Nuril said in a recent interview. "I told him, 'You need to go to a psychiatrist.' "
After months of this, she recorded one of the calls so she would have evidence of his behavior.
The result: She lost her job and went to jail. Meanwhile, his career has flourished.
Ms. Nuril's case, which is now before Indonesia's Supreme Court, has become a very public example of the country's failure to protect women from sexual harassment, as well as the notoriously capricious nature of its judicial system.
Advocates for women say that unwanted sexual advances and obscene remarks are depressingly common in Indonesian workplaces, and that women have little recourse when subjected to them.
"We don't have sufficient laws that protect women and deal with this kind of harassment," said Tunggal Pawestri, a women's rights activist in Jakarta.
Ms. Nuril, a 40-year-old mother of three, grew up on Lombok, a conservative, predominantly Muslim island east of Bali. In 2010, she got a temporary job helping with accounting at Senior High School Seven Mataram in Lombok's provincial capital.
She says her troubles began in 2013 with the arrival of a new principal, Muslim, who goes by one name as many Indonesians do.
In April of that year, according to Ms. Nuril, Mr. Muslim began talking to her frequently in lewd terms, both in person and on the phone. He told her in explicit detail about his sexual activities with another employee and hounded Ms. Nuril to have an affair with him, she said.
Twice, the school staff met at hotels. Both times, he showed her stains on a bed from what he said were sexual encounters with her co-worker hours earlier, she said.
Ms. Nuril worried that she would lose her job if she complained about the harassment, especially since her position was temporary.
Meanwhile, Mr. Muslim gave others, including Ms. Nuril's husband, the impression they were having an affair. To prove otherwise, she recorded one of Mr. Muslim's phone calls in August 2013.
She said the 15-minute call was typical: The principal talked in graphic detail about his sexual activities. (The New York Times reviewed a court transcript of the recording and confirmed its content.)
She played the recording for her husband and a colleague. Months later, a teacher who had learned of the recording copied it from her phone while Ms. Nuril was in another room.
Ms. Nuril said that fewer than a dozen people initially heard the recording, and that it was more than a year before Mr. Muslim learned of its existence.
She said he offered to extend her contract if she deleted the recording -- which might not have prevented copies from circulating further, but would have made it harder for her to pursue a case against him. When she refused, she said, he fired her.
Repeated attempts to contact Mr. Muslim for comment were unsuccessful. But his lead lawyer, Asmuni, said Mr. Muslim was the real victim in the case. Ms. Nuril, he said, broke the law and deserved to go to jail.
"Men have to be protected, too," he said. "She is an ungrateful person and does not know her place."
Three months after firing Ms. Nuril, the principal went to the police and accused her of criminal defamation. The police interrogated Ms. Nuril half a dozen times before arresting her in March 2017.
"I don't really get what was defamatory," she said. "It is you yourself telling people about your bad behavior."
Ultimately, prosecutors charged her with distributing obscene material, not defamation. A prosecutor in the case, Ida Ayu Putu Camundi Dewi, declined to speak by telephone and did not respond to written questions.
Ms. Nuril spent two months in a Lombok jail. At her trial, teachers from the school testified that they, not Ms. Nuril, were the ones who had taken the recording from her phone and distributed it.
"She recorded it for her own protection," said her lawyer, Joko Jumadi. "She kept it for so long. Even when it spread, it was not her who distributed it."
Mr. Muslim testified that he had not been describing sex with an employee on the recording, but his fantasies about an American porn star, according to Ms. Nuril and Mr. Joko.
The trial court found Ms. Nuril not guilty. But that was not the end.
In Indonesia, prosecutors can appeal an acquittal. They took her case to the Supreme Court, where the justices -- without a hearing -- reversed the verdict in November, finding Ms. Nuril guilty of distributing indecent material electronically.
The three-judge panel sentenced her to six months in jail and fined her $35,000 -- a fortune for Ms. Nuril's family. Failure to pay it would add three months to her sentence.
"I was really shocked because all the witnesses said clearly I was not the one who transmitted the material," Ms. Nuril said in the interview, fighting back tears.
There was public outrage in response to the ruling. Indonesia's president, Joko Widodo, who is running for re-election in April, hinted that he would spare Ms. Nuril more jail time if the Supreme Court rejects her final appeal, which her lawyer filed last week.
"If the case review does not provide justice, then she can apply for clemency to the president," Mr. Joko told reporters. "Once she has applied for clemency, that's where I come in."
The office of the attorney general, Muhammad Prasetyo, said any punishment would be delayed until Ms. Nuril's appeal was resolved.
Mr. Muslim appears to have suffered few professional repercussions from the episode. After the recording became public, he was removed as principal and given ever-higher management positions within the government of Mataram, the provincial capital.
"He is healthy, he enjoys life," said Mr. Asmuni, his lawyer. "He is still trusted by the government to stay on in his position. He is still in power."
The Mataram mayor, Ahyar Abduh, who has the authority to discipline Mr. Muslim, did not answer repeated phone calls or respond to written questions. Aides to the mayor said they could not discuss the case.
After the Supreme Court's ruling in November, Ms. Nuril reported Mr. Muslim to the police for sexual harassment. A spokesman for the West Nusa Tenggara Police Department, I Komang Suartana, said the police were considering whether there was a law that would apply in the case.
Saying something obscene is not a crime, he said, and Indonesia's law against sexual harassment does not cover verbal abuse unless there is also physical contact.
The legal system's deficiencies mean that Indonesian women are expected to tolerate harassment -- and, sometimes, sexual relations with their bosses -- as the price of keeping a job, women's advocates say.
"As long as the law does not change, women will forever be closed off and will never want to report it," Mr. Joko said. "Especially if you look at Nuril's case. You are the victim, but then you are the one who is put into prison."
Advocates for women say the system has other egregious faults. For example, female police officers are supposed to handle sexual abuse cases and other crimes against women.
But the national police force has a chronic shortage of women, in part because of its longtime practice of subjecting female recruits to a so-called virginity test, an invasive procedure known as the "two-finger test."
"If the national police are serious about handling sexual harassment, the first thing they have to do is stop this degrading and unscientific practice against their female applicants," said Andreas Harsono, Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch, which has campaigned against the procedure.
Ms. Nuril never intended to become a symbol, but she is pleased that so many women, rights groups and even the president have expressed support for her.
But she does not expect things to improve for those in her situation anytime soon.
"A lot of women still feel they are under pressure from their bosses and their bosses can do whatever they want," she said. "For me, justice seems so far away."

LAUSD teachers went on strike in 1989. But are the stakes higher in 2019?

Texto completo: Whether they were stuck in an auditorium or playing long-term hooky, many a school kid old enough to remember the 1989 Los Angeles teachers strike recalls the period as nine days of good old-fashioned lawlessness.
Quoted in a New York Times article at the time, LAPD Lieut. Frank Valdez expressed his concern about “little predators” roaming LA’s downtown streets. “The problem kids are not going to go to school and it’s going to create problems all over, not just on campus,” he said during the strike.
Jamie Todd Rubin, an 11th-grader at Cleveland High School at the time, wistfully remembers weekday ventures to the beach, Valley bowling alleys and movie theatres while his teachers fought for better pay as his personal “golden age.”
Triumphantly, he recalled that “teachers ended up getting what they were looking for too.” In many respects, they did.
By all accounts, teachers succeeded in gleaning higher wages, more administrative control and greater stature for their union from the Los Angeles Unified School District after thousands walked off the job in the spring of 1989.
It was the second teachers strike since the founding of United Teachers Los Angeles in 1970, ushering angst into the city and turmoil to the nation’s second largest school system.
In 1989, the major win for teachers after the walkout that lasted nine days was getting school-based management and shared decision-making into a contract. Around 80 percent of members participated in the strike, and half of LAUSD K-12 students stayed home.

As an army of 30,000 teachers stand ready to form new picket lines on Monday, their demands ring markedly familiar: higher pay, relief from ballooning class sizes, and more nurses, librarians and counselors trained to address the medical and psychological needs of today’s students.
Has much really changed?
Former UTLA President John Perez, who was on the picket lines both as a teacher in 1970, said it this way:
“To be perfectly honest, very little has changed. In 1970 we felt disrespected. In 1989 we felt disrespected. And in 2018 teachers feel disrespected.”
Undercurrents of teacher empowerment were also at the crux of the 1970 strike, UTLA’s first, when around half of the young union’s members went off the job for nearly five weeks.
Then, as now, district officials threatened that acceding to their calls for salary increases would spell financial ruin.
Parallels between ’89 and today run as deep as rhetorical strategy, like the union’s relentless critiques of LA Unified Superintendent Austin Beutner.
“Oh yeah it was a big war in ’89 and the union made superintendent [Leonard] Britton the bad guy,” Perez said. Picketing teachers wore buttons with his face over a lemon, or with a slash over his face. “We called him Lenny the lemon.”
Some have argued all this recurrence is evidence that the lasting effects of earlier strikes have been mixed at best, and that securing lasting public funding for education has proven elusive over the decades.
Former LAUSD elementary school teacher Michael Romo lamented the lack of progress since 1989.
“Back in my day we had nurses, smaller class sizes and maybe even better stocked libraries,” said Romo, director of the California Teachers Association in Burbank and Glendale.
He went on strike in 1989, his first year of bilingual teaching at Norwood Street Elementary School. “For 30 years to come back to the same issue, it’s like we’ve made no progress.”
Of course, things do change in 30 years. Along with overarching economic differences and a friendlier face in the governor’s mansion, a key factor in this looming walkout that appears to have been absent from previous strikes is competing visions for the future of public education.
UCLA Professor John Rogers, director of the university’s Institute for Democracy, Education, and Access, interpreted the current impasse between the district and the union as a reflection of opposite reactions LAUSD’s current financial and enrollment woes.
“The district is thinking about how they can contain costs and deal with a growing charter school sector by devolving the district over time as a portfolio of schools,” he said. “While teachers think the way forward is to more broadly improve the quality of its own educational program, only sometimes acknowledging how much spending that requires.”
The emergence of charter schools in Los Angeles, which are privately managed but publicly funded, have been central to the standoff between district and union leadership.
Perez seems to think this is uncharted territory, particularly what he said was superintendent Beutner’s goals to break up and “privatize” the a time-honored and democratic institution like L.A. Unified.
“The existential threat to public education as we know it is real. That wasn’t there in 1989,” he said. The district’s financial woes this time around also have some experts worried about a state takeover.
“My understanding is after the strike it will appear to be a win for teachers and then the layoffs will come soon after,” said UCLA Professor of Education at the Graduate School of Education and Information Studies Pedro Noguera.
Noting LA County’s recent appointment of a fiscal team to the district, he said “That’s my fear, that they’re at risk of being taken over.”
Carmen Romero, special education teacher at South Gate High School, remembers those long days in auditoriums, in the gym and on the football field as a 10th-grader at Bell High School during the 1989 strike.
“We didn’t feel valued as students,” she said about the nine days of boredom. More of a rule-follower, she was on campus every day of the strike.
“But it made me appreciate school more, and feel like I deserve things like desks and respect.” Now that she’s gearing up to get on the picket line as a teacher, “It’s the same feeling.”

Texto completo: FBI feared Trump working for Russia, Times report says
The New York Times reports that law enforcement officials became so concerned by President Donald Trump's behavior in the days after he fired FBI Director James Comey that they began investigating whether he had been working for Russia against U.S. interests.
The report, published late Friday, cites unnamed former law enforcement officials. Special counsel Robert Mueller took over the probe when he was appointed after Comey's firing. It's unclear whether Mueller is still pursuing it.
Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani told the Times that he had no knowledge of the inquiry.
Teen's 'bird'-brained attempt at driving ends badly - Police say a Utah teenager crashed into another car when she covered her eyes as part of the so-called "Bird Box Challenge."
Layton police Lt. Travis Lyman said Friday that the 17-year-old hit another car after she pulled a hat over her eyes to emulate "Bird Box," a Sandra Bullock movie on Netflix where characters must be blindfolded to avoid visions that urge them to die.
Videos of people trying to do things while blindfolded have attracted widespread attention online, and Netflix tweeted a warning about the challenge last week. No one was hurt in the Monday crash north of Salt Lake City.
Lyman says it should serve as a warning he never thought he'd have to give: Don't drive while blindfolded.
Ginsburg's cancer gone, court says - Tests revealed that Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has no additional cancer after her surgery in December, and no further treatment is needed, the Supreme Court said Friday.
"Justice Ginsburg will continue to work from home next week and will participate in the consideration and decision of the cases on the basis of the briefs and the transcripts of oral arguments," court spokeswoman Kathleen Arberg said in a statement.
Ginsburg had surgery Dec. 21 for two malignant nodules in her left lung, the 85-year-old justice's third bout with cancer.
911 audio reveals shock after comatose woman gave birth - Panicking staff members at a long-term care facility scrambled to save a baby born to an Arizona woman in a vegetative state amid their shock to learn she was pregnant, according to 911 audio released Friday.
The audio from the Dec. 29 birth includes a nurse at the Phoenix facility saying, "One of our patients just had a baby, and we had no idea she was pregnant."
Since that day, the woman and the baby have been recovering at a hospital. The woman, 29, who has been incapacitated since age 3, was sexually assaulted, police say. Investigators are collecting DNA from Hacienda HealthCare's male employees.
Rookie officer in California killed at crash scene - A 22-year-old police officer on the job only a few weeks was shot and killed by a suspect who opened fire as she was investigating a three-car crash, authorities in California said.
The suspect, who has not been identified, was later found dead inside a home with a self-inflicted gunshot wound after a standoff with officers, the Davis Police Department said Friday.
Police said Officer Natalie Corona was shot after responding alone to a traffic accident before 7 p.m. Thursday in the town that is home to the University of California, Davis. Police have not determined what prompted the attack.
Episcopal Church allows same-sex marriage in N.Y. diocese - The Episcopal Church on Friday cleared the way for same-sex marriages in a New York diocese where they were barred by a bishop who claimed the church had been "hijacked by the "Gay Rights Agenda."
The Rev. William Love faces disciplinary action for his November directive barring same-sex marriages in the Albany-based diocese.
Church leaders in July overwhelmingly passed a same-sex marriage resolution that gives bishops with theological objections to same-sex marriages the option to have another bishop oversee services. Activists said Love is the only U.S. bishop entirely refusing to comply with that resolution, which went into effect Dec. 2.
Hawaii Democrat plans 2020 run - Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii has announced she is running for president in 2020.
Gabbard said in a CNN interview set to air Saturday night that she will formally announce her candidacy within the next week.
The Iraq War veteran, 37, is the first Hindu elected to Congress. She has visited New Hampshire and Iowa in recent months and has written a memoir that's due to be published in May.
Gabbard was criticized in 2016 for meeting with President Bashar Assad, who has been accused of war crimes.

Trump blasts Comey as 'total sleaze' in response to FBI probe reports

Resumen: The president goes on a tweetstorm in response to New York Times report of a Russia-related FBI investigation of Trump last year.

Texto completo: President Donald Trump, in response to reports that the FBI began an investigation of him last year to find out whether he had a clandestine agenda to help Russia, said Saturday that former FBI director James Comey and other "losers" at the bureau "tried to do a number on your President. "
He called Comey a "total sleaze" and "crooked cop. " The president also took swipes at special counsel Robert Mueller and the New York Times, which broke the story Friday night. "My firing of James Comey was a great day for America," he tweeted.
Comey responded Saturday morning in a tweet that quoted President Franklin D. Roosevelt: "I ask you to judge me by the enemies I have made. "
The newspaper said the decision to investigate Trump himself was an aggressive move by FBI officials confronting the chaotic aftermath of the firing of Comey and enduring the president’s verbal assaults on the Russia investigation as a “witch hunt. ”
CNN reported that counterintelligence agents were investigating why Trump was acting in ways that seemed to benefit Russia.
Both news organizations said Trump's firing of Comey was a major factor prompting the FBI to take action.
Although the report was published Friday night and prompted a sharp response from White House press secretary Sarah Sanders, Trump did not weigh in until 7:05 a. m Saturday.
"Wow, just learned in the Failing New York Times that the corrupt former leaders of the FBI, almost all fired or forced to leave the agency for some very bad reasons, opened up an investigation on me, for no reason & with no proof, after I fired Lyin’ James Comey, a total sleaze!
In a series of tweets, he said the FBI was in "complete turmoil" at the time because of Comey's "poor leadership" and his handling of an investigation of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.
"My firing of James Comey was a great day for America," Trump tweeted. "He was a Crooked Cop. . . . . . . . . . . who is being totally protected by his best friend, Bob Mueller, & the 13 Angry Democrats. . . "
He singled out several FBI agents in his five-part tweetstorm.
"Lyin’ James Comey, Andrew McCabe, Peter S and his lover, agent Lisa Page, & more, all disgraced and/or fired and caught in the act. These are just some of the losers that tried to do a number on your President," he tweeted. "Part of the Witch Hunt. Remember the 'insurance policy?' This is it!"
Trump was referring to charges that some FBI agents, among them McCabe, Peter Strzok and Page, a colleague he was intimately involved with, were part of a conspiracy to undermine the president.
Addressing the Russia aspect of the Times report, Trump said he had been "FAR tougher on Russia than Obama, Bush or Clinton. Maybe tougher than any other President. "
He repeated his long held contention that "getting along with Russia is a good thing, not a bad thing. "
Sanders said in her statement Friday night that Comey was fired for just cause and that Trump has never favored Russia.
“This is absurd. James Comey was fired because he’s a disgraced partisan hack, and his Deputy Andrew McCabe, who was in charge at the time, is a known liar fired by the FBI. Unlike President Obama, who let Russia and other foreign adversaries push America around, President Trump has actually been tough on Russia. ”
The obstruction probe was an idea the FBI had previously considered, but it didn't start until Comey was fired, CNN reported. The justification went beyond Trump's firing of Comey, CNN said, according to its sources, and included the president's conversation with Comey in the Oval Office asking him to drop the investigation into his former national security adviser Michael Flynn.
Trump insisted last year that he didn't fire FBI Director James Comey because of the Russia investigation, despite video and documentary evidence to the contrary, including a key interview with NBC News.
“I was going to fire Comey knowing there was no good time to do it,” he told NBC anchor Lester Holt. “And in fact, when I decided to just do it, I said to myself — I said, you know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story. It’s an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election that they should’ve won. ”
"Not that it matters but I never fired James Comey because of Russia!" Trump tweeted shortly after the firing. "The Corrupt Mainstream Media loves to keep pushing that narrative, but they know it is not true!"
The FBI director's firing is central to an obstruction of justice investigation being conducted by Mueller, who is also looking into Russian attempts to influence the 2016 election in order to help Trump.

President misses opportunity at border

Texto completo: To Sister Norma Pimentel, it sounded like a golden opportunity to touch the heart of a president, to give him a firsthand account of the suffering she sees every day.
The night before President Trump's Thursday visit to McAllen, Texas, Sister Norma, executive director of Catholic Charities of the Rio Grande Valley, got a call from the Border Patrol, inviting her to join the president at a roundtable discussion.
It was understandable that she would be asked to be a part of anything that purports to be a serious, high-level discussion of immigration issues along the U.S.-Mexico border.
Sister Norma is something of a local hero, loved and respected for the respite center that she runs near the McAllen bus station, working with law enforcement and an army of volunteers to help hundreds of desperate migrants every day. These people are in this country legally, most of them wearing electronic ankle monitors, as they await a court hearing on their requests for asylum.
Even Pope Francis has hailed her work, singling her out in a 2015 broadcast. "I want to thank you," Francis said, "and through you to thank all of the sisters of religious orders in the U.S. for the work that you have done and that you do in the United States ... is it appropriate for the pope to say this? I love you all very much."
Sister Norma had written an open letter to Trump, which was published by the Washington Post ("Welcome to the border, Mr. President," Spokesman-Review, Jan. 11), imploring the president to see her respite center for himself, and to meet some of the people who come through: "Some days, we see 20 people. Other days, it's closer to 300. In recent weeks, it has been very busy. Some stay a few hours, but many spend the night before heading on to new destinations. Since we opened, more than 100,000 have come through our doors."
Still, if that couldn't happen, this was surely the next-best thing.
Or so she had hoped.
Sister Norma showed up as she had been instructed to do, at 11 a.m. sharp. The president arrived two hours later.
But instead of having an opportunity to speak with him as she had expected, the nun found herself sitting silently near the front of a stage-managed event featuring politicians, law enforcement representatives, a rancher and two relatives of fallen officers.
All those people's points of view are important, of course, but there was no one on the roundtable who could speak from experience about what it is like to deal with the ongoing human needs of migrants.
The only pastor in the group, the Rev. Ramiro Peqa, was from Waco - nearly a 61/2-hour drive away. His contribution to the conversation was to heap praise on Trump.
Before Trump had gone to McAllen, he had reportedly dismissed the whole trip as no more than a photo opportunity, foisted upon him by the White House communications operation.
"It's not going to change a damn thing, but I'm still doing it," Trump said of his planned border visit, according to the New York Times.
Apparently, that was indeed the case. And Sister Norma - who wears a navy-blue habit and a large wooden cross that she carved herself around her neck - was there to add to the visual.
She was tempted to speak up, she told me, "but I did not. You know, I thought that it was not part of what he had planned.
"I don't know that he came away with anything other than a reaffirmation of what he wanted to do, as far as his reasons for (building a) wall. He made sure that the right people were at the table to support him on that," she said.
"I think that if he came to the Rio Grande Valley to become aware and understand our reality here on the border, I think our local leaders would have had something to tell him that he needed to know about," Sister Norma added, "what is our experience on the border here, and what has happened, how we see what's happening. And so he didn't care to hear from us."
Indeed, it was a day of missed opportunities.
The president's roundtable at the Border Patrol's McAllen station was only a few blocks away from the processing center where children separated from their parents were held last year in cage-like enclosures.
When my Post colleague Philip Rucker asked Trump whether he planned to stop by that notorious site, the president answered: "I would do it. I would stop there if we could. You'd have to ask the Secret Service.
"It's not a bad idea, actually," Trump added. "I wouldn't mind, if you want to do that. I wouldn't mind."
But he didn't go there.
Of course, he didn't go there.
Maybe next time.

Legislator junkets are burning Californians

Texto completo: Picture this: As the deadly Camp Fire was ravaging Butte County and leveling the town of Paradise, some California legislators were meeting in Hawaii with officials from various industries, including utility company executives who hope Sacramento shields them from billions in potential liability from increasingly costly wildfires.
Doesn't that just about set your hair on fire?
Now ponder this: Though not all events that bring together lawmakers and corporate and other special interests have the spectacularly bad timing and optics as last fall's $8,000-per-person California Independent Voter Project retreat in Maui, all of them are perfectly legal.
We'll go ahead and say it: This stinks.
Of course, corporate interests and others who hope to make their case to state government have the right to their say. We all do.
That's the nature of our system. Junkets like these, however, distort the process.
A New York Times article earlier this month on the retreat suggests that anyone canattend the annual CIVP event — for a price.
"What would be wrong with elected officials and business discussing issues?" Voter Project chief Dan Howle told the Times, also pointing out that the conference rules prohibit lobbying or discussion of specific legislation. "If the public wants to go, the public can pay a fee."
Got that, John Q. Public? Just send along your own fat check for a ticket — oh, and make sure you get the OK from the boss for the time off — and you'll surely score a good seat. Bring your "fat pants" to make sure you enjoy the poolside buffet and open bar.
One other thing: To put more punch into your personal pitch "on the issues," John, bring along that checkbook that'll prove you can compete with the millions some of your dinner partners are going to spend on lobbying and campaign donations down the road to further bend the ear of "your representative."
Folks, this sick joke is on you.
Assembling "captive" audiences of influential lawmakers in a far-off Polynesian paradise or some "Where Eagles Dare" mountain ski lodge and regaling them with one-sided explorations of issues they'll be acting on is neither democratic nor necessary. These tilt the playing field far beyond anything resembling fair.
The people's business should be done where the people can take part. These types of junkets have too much potential to simply be the jet-set version of the sinister "smoke-filled room" where decisions are made. They should be relegated to the past.
The supremely cynical pragmatist might suggest lawmakers "need" this type of quality time with such power players so they can be "educated" on how to fix hot messes like Pacific Gas & Electric.
PG&E, which seemed to be in the clear from potential billions in liability from then-record 2017 wildfires, is now teetering on bankruptcy thanks to the now-record Camp Fire, which left 86 dead and additional billions in damage. Our society can't surrender to that level of cynicism.
For now, we'll reserve judgment on potential legislative solutions – which currently range from extending the recently enacted 2017 "lifeline" to also cover 2018 fires to a potential breakup of PG&E. Lawmakers definitely have their work cut out for them, but they need to get it done without undue influence from Mai Tais and kalua pork.
Voters across the Golden State should keep a sharp eye on their own representatives and remember to take it into account at election time.

Texto completo: Report: FBI probed if Trump secretly worked for Russia
WASHINGTON -- Law enforcement officials became so concerned by President Donald Trump's behavior in the days after he fired FBI Director James Comey that they began investigating whether he had been working for Russia against U.S. interests, The New York Times reported Friday.
The report cites unnamed former law enforcement officials and others familiar with the investigation.
The inquiry forced counterintelligence investigators to evaluate whether Trump was a potential threat to national security, and they also sought to determine whether Trump was deliberately working for Russia or had unintentionally been influenced by Moscow.
The Times reports that FBI agents and some top officials became suspicious of Trump's ties to Russia during the 2016 presidential campaign but didn't launch an investigation at that time because they weren't sure how to approach such a sensitive and important probe, according to the sources. But Trump's behavior in the days around Comey's May 2017 firing, specifically two instances in which he seemed to tie Comey's ousting to the Russia investigation, helped trigger the counterintelligence part of the investigation.
Robert Mueller took over the investigation when he was appointed special counsel soon after Comey's firing. The overall investigation is looking into Russian election interference and whether Trump's campaign coordinated with Russians. The Times says it's unclear whether Mueller is still pursuing the counterintelligence angle.

Mexico deploys 4,000 troops, copters against pipeline theft
MEXICO CITY -- Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said Friday he has ordered helicopters and 4,000 troops to guard the nation's pipelines and fuel depots in an offensive against massive fuel theft.
The helicopters are watching for organized gangs that drill illegal taps into underground ducts carrying gasoline and diesel. Lopez Obrador ordered key pipelines shut down after thefts soared recently.
Long lines continued at gas stations in Mexico City and outlying states Friday as tanker trucks struggled to supply fuel normally delivered through pipelines.
Most Mexicans understood the need to crack down on $3 billion per year in fuel thefts, but patience was wearing thin.
"We are asking for people's understanding," Lopez Obrador said.

Rookie California cop is shot, killed in ambush at crash scene
DAVIS, Calif. -- A 22-year-old police officer on the job only a few weeks was shot and killed by a suspect who opened fire as she was investigating a three-car crash, authorities in Northern California said.
The suspect, who has not been identified, was later found dead inside a home with a self-inflicted gunshot wound following a short standoff with officers, the Davis Police Department said Friday.
Police said Officer Natalie Corona was ambushed by a gunman on a bicycle shot after responding alone to a traffic accident Thursday evening in the city west of Sacramento.
One of the drivers in the crash, Christian Pascual, 25, told the Sacramento Bee that the shooter appeared to have been a bystander who fired from behind him.

Woman sought in death of Nev. manicurist found in Ariz.
LAS VEGAS -- A 21-year-old woman sought for almost two weeks by authorities in Las Vegas after allegedly skipping out on a $35 manicure and using a stolen car to run over and kill a manicurist has been arrested in Arizona, police said Friday.
Krystal Whipple was taken into custody in the Phoenix suburb of Glendale, authorities said.
Las Vegas police said prosecutors will seek her extradition to Las Vegas where Whipple was sought in a warrant on murder and robbery charges in the killing of Ngoc Nguyen, 51.
Police said Whipple tried to pay for her manicure with a fraudulent credit card Dec. 29 before telling Nguyen that she was going to her car to get cash, then drove away, killing Nguyen as she stood in front of of the vehicle as it accelerated.

In Europe, 21 deaths deemed weather-related
BELGRADE, Serbia -- Heavy snow paralyzed much of Europe for yet another day, cutting off mountain villages, sparking avalanches like one that crashed into a Swiss hotel and killing at least four more people Friday.
Workers at the Hotel Saentis in eastern Switzerland spent Friday shoveling out hip-deep snow after a 330-yard-wide avalanche smashed through the hotel's windows Thursday.
In all, at least 21 weather-related deaths have been reported in Europe in the last 10 days.
The Bulgarian Red Cross said two snowboarders were killed in an avalanche in southwest Bulgaria's Pirin Mountains.
A snowplow driver died Friday in Germany after his vehicle toppled into an icy river, while an electrical worker in Albania suffered a fatal heart attack while repairing damaged power lines.

Court says Ginsburg has no cancer remaining
WASHINGTON -- Tests revealed that Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has no additional cancer following her surgery in December, and no further treatment is needed, the Supreme Court announced Friday.
"Justice Ginsburg will continue to work from home next week and will participate in the consideration and decision of the cases on the basis of the briefs and the transcripts of oral arguments," court spokeswoman Kathleen Arberg said in a statement.
Ginsburg had surgery Dec. 21 for two malignant nodules in her left lung, the 85-year-old justice's third bout with cancer.
This week, for the first time since she joined the court in 1993, she missed a round of oral arguments. Ginsburg is the oldest member of the court, and the longest-serving member of the court's four-member liberal wing.

Saudi woman: Rahaf Mohammed Alqunun, 18, who said she was abused by her family and feared for her life if deported back home to Saudi Arabia, left Thailand on Friday night for Canada, which has granted her asylum, officials said.

Hat in the ring: Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii has announced that she is running for president in 2020.
Gabbard, a 37-year-old Iraq War veteran and the first Hindu elected to Congress, said in a CNN interview slated to air Saturday night that she will formally announce her candidacy next week.

Medicaid Fraud Is Suspected at Care Center Where Comatose Woman Was Raped

Texto completo: State investigators in Arizona are examining $3.4 million in possible Medicaid fraud at the parent company of a Phoenix nursing center where a woman in a vegetative state was raped and gave birth to a boy in December, according to court records.
The inquiry into the company, Hacienda HealthCare, began in 2016, when investigators at the health agency that manages the state's Medicaid program started asking questions about Hacienda's organizational and accounting structure. Investigators wanted to know whether Hacienda executives improperly shifted overhead expenses in the company to a subsidiary at the same location that then overcharged the state's Medicaid program.
Investigators with the inspector general's office of the state health agency, the Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System, have told Hacienda that $3.4 million in Medicaid payments to the company, for expenses from July 2013 to June 2014, appears suspicious and potentially fraudulent.
Nearly three years after the inquiry began, the state and the company are still locked in a legal battle. Hacienda officials have refused to turn over thousands of pages of internal financial documents sought by the state in multiple subpoenas, arguing that the requests are burdensome and beyond the state's investigative scope. The state has said the investigation cannot be completed without them.
In an effort to force Hacienda to comply with the subpoenas, the state health agency sued the company in 2017 in Maricopa County Superior Court. A judge ruled in the state's favor but Hacienda appealed, which is where the case stands today in the Arizona Court of Appeals.
"We can confirm that the office does have an open investigation into Hacienda related to fraud, waste and abuse," Heidi Capriotti, a spokeswoman for the Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System, said. "As part of that investigation, A.H.C.C.C.S. requested a variety of Hacienda's financial records, and sought enforcement of its administrative subpoena when Hacienda refused to comply with the request."
Hacienda said in a statement on Friday: "At every step in the process, Hacienda has strenuously denied any and all allegations of overpayment. The company has produced a voluminous set of records to the investigating agency meant to prove that no such overpayments occurred. Most importantly, this lawsuit has nothing to do with quality of care issues."
In earlier court filings, the company said that it had used the same "cost-effective management structure" since 2001 and that this structure had been approved by independent auditors and was not questioned by state regulators until the 2016 investigation. The company said it had turned over more than 16,000 pages of documents to the Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System but had resisted the agency's other requests.
"A.H.C.C.C.S. exceeded its authority, and the superior court's order enforcing the subpoena should be vacated," lawyers for the company wrote in the appeal.
While that investigation continues, detectives with the Phoenix Police Department recently opened a criminal investigation at a nursing home operated by Hacienda HealthCare after a 29-year-old woman who has been in a coma nearly her entire life gave birth to a boy there on Dec. 29. The two investigations have brought intense national scrutiny on Hacienda, Arizona's largest privately operated long-term nursing company for people with developmental disabilities. People in its care have a range of intellectual and physical disabilities.
In recent years, Hacienda has also been investigated by the Arizona Department of Health Services over the treatment of its patients. In 2013, the agency found that a male employee at the nursing home being investigated, the Hacienda Skilled Nursing Facility, had made sexually explicit remarks to patients, including telling a resident that his penis was erect. In 2017, investigators reported that employees freely walked in on patients while they were naked and showering.
The woman at the center of the police investigation has been at Hacienda since she was 3. She cannot move on her own, cannot communicate and requires total supervision, according to health records obtained by The New York Times.
The San Carlos Apache Tribe, whose reservation is about 100 miles east of Phoenix, said the woman was an "enrolled member" of the tribe. The tribe's chairman and her mother, who was granted permanent guardianship in 2009, have not returned calls seeking comment.
On Friday, the police released a frantic 911 call from the Hacienda nursing center when the woman went into labor on Dec. 29. The caller said no one knew that the woman had been pregnant. Both the mother and the baby were recovering at a Phoenix hospital, the police said this week.
"She was not in a position to give consent to any of this," Sgt. Tommy Thompson, a police spokesman, said on Wednesday. "This was a helpless victim who was sexually assaulted."
Since the Phoenix police announced their investigation a week ago, detectives have collected the DNA of male employees at Hacienda; the state dispatched health inspectors to check on the other patients there; and the company's longtime chief executive, Bill Timmons, resigned. Over nearly three decades, Mr. Timmons had built Hacienda into a major player in long-term health care in Arizona.
The company says it operates more than 40 programs through its subsidiaries, which provide services to more than 2,000 people every year. The Hacienda Skilled Nursing Facility, which is one of those subsidiaries, has at least 74 patient beds, according to federal records. Most of the subsidiaries operate out of the same property, about six miles south of downtown Phoenix, and share the same directors and executives.
From 2009 to last October, Hacienda received at least $6.7 million from the state in Medicaid funding and other money, according to public records. In his position at Hacienda, Mr. Timmons was well compensated over the past decade, according to the company's financial filings. His total pay doubled from 2008 to 2017, when he received $674,212 in salary and other compensation.
But he resigned abruptly on Monday after reports of the police investigation became public, the company announced. Mr. Timmons had been at the center of the legal wrangling between Hacienda and the state, and he had fiercely defended the company's corporate structure as legal and above board.
When Mr. Timmons resigned, Gary Orman, the executive vice president of the company's board, said Hacienda would "accept nothing less than a full accounting of this absolutely horrifying situation."

Rep. King condemns racist ideology

Texto completo: Rep. Steve King denied allegations that he supports white nationalism and white supremacy Thursday after a recent New York Times article tied the controversial Iowa Republican to further white nationalist rhetoric.
"White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization — how did that language become offensive?" King said in an interview with the Times. "Why did I sit in classes teaching me about the merits of our history and our civilization?"
King responded in a news release Thursday condemned white nationalist and supremacist ideologies.
"I want to make one thing abundantly clear; I reject those labels and the evil ideology that they define," King said. "Further, I condemn anyone that supports this evil and bigoted ideology which saw in its ultimate expression the systematic murder of 6 million innocent Jewish lives."
King also said he still identifies as "an advocate for Western civilization's values" and a "Nationalist."
King's alleged ties to white nationalist groups have caused politicians and groups on both sides of the aisle to disavow King. The 4th District representative was rebuked by Iowa Jewish leaders, disavowed by Rep. Steve Stivers, R-Ohio, and abandoned by the National Republican Congressional Committee heading into the 2018 midterms.
After the election, Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds said: "I think that Steve King needs to make a decision if he wants to represent the people and the values of the 4th District or do something else."
Reigniting the criticism, shortly before his close election: King met in Austria with members of the Freedom Party, a political organization founded by a former Nazi SS officer. He also sat for an interview with Unzensuriert, a Freedom Party-aligned publication, after a trip funded by a Holocaust memorial group in August.
King has said the group is made up of "respectable people" who fight against anti-Semitism.
King also praised Faith Goldy, a candidate for Toronto mayor, a far-right white nationalist, on Twitter in October.
The New York Times article tied President Donald Trump's immigration policies and recent push for a border wall to King, who has advocated for similar policies — including a 12-foot wall on the U.S.-Mexico border — years before Trump was a name in politics.
"I market-tested (Trump's) immigration policy for 14 years, and that ought to be worth something," he told the Times.
King is facing increasing challenges in Iowa.
On Wednesday, state Sen. Randy Feenstra, the chair of the Senate's powerful Ways and Means Committee, said he would run for the Republican nomination in King's 4th Congressional District. Prominent Republicans — Reynolds, U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley and Iowa Republican Party chair Jeff Kaufmann — did not offer support for King after Feenstra's announcement.
"The last election was a wake-up call for it to be that close," Reynolds told WHO-TV. "That indicates that it does open the door for other individuals to take a look at that."
King's fellow House Republicans denounced King's comments to the Times on Thursday.
Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney said King's remarks were "abhorrent and racist." Rep. Justin Amash of Michigan tweeted: "This is an embrace of racism, and it has no place in Congress or anywhere."

Texto completo: ProPublica announced Thursday that Ava Kofman is joining its staff as a reporter covering technology. She starts on Jan. 21.
Kofman joins ProPublica from The Intercept, where she was a contributing reporter whose work encompassed algorithms, artificial intelligence and surveillance technology. She has written about the unsettling ways schools and police are using face-recognition technology and plans from Axon (formerly Taser) to employ AI to “anticipate” criminal activity. Kofman mined the Edward Snowden archive to reveal the NSA’s pioneering use of voice recognition to spy on people, and she also revealed how companies now do risk assessments of employees by using AI to analyze the sounds of their voices.
In addition to The Intercept, Ava’s work has appeared in The New York Times Magazine, Harper’s Magazine (where she also worked as an editor), The Atlantic, The Guardian, The New Republic, VICE and The Nation, among other publications. Along with reporting her own stories, she has worked as a fact-checker and researcher on features and investigations at Al Jazeera America and Rolling Stone, and she served as the editor in chief of online publication The New Inquiry.
“Ava comes aboard at a time when we are expanding our coverage of the central roles that technology, algorithms and social media play in our lives,” ProPublica Managing Editor Robin Fields said. “We’re looking forward to bringing her reporting and analytical coverage of the tech industry to our team.”
“ProPublica’s indispensable coverage of technology was part of what inspired me to become a journalist,” Kofman said. “I’m honored and excited to be joining a newsroom that has set the gold standard for investigations into algorithmic accountability.”

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who oversees the special counsel investigation into the 2016 election, is expected to leave his post in a matter of weeks, a person familiar with the matter said Wednesday.
The move is timed to the anticipated confirmation of William Barr, who was nominated by President Donald Trump to succeed ousted Attorney General Jeff Sessions.
The person familiar with the transition said Rosenstein is leaving on his own terms.
Senate confirmation hearings for Barr are scheduled to start Jan. 15, and a vote could follow in the coming weeks.
Rosenstein's expected departure would come after a tumultuous 20 months, in which he has often been placed at odds with the administration he works for and Trump himself.
Since his appointment of Robert Mueller to lead the Justice Department's investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election, Rosenstein has been the target of unrelenting criticism from Trump, who has derided the inquiry as a witch hunt.
During that time, Rosenstein has been seen as a key shield for Mueller as Trump and some Republican lawmakers have openly mulled removing both Rosenstein and Mueller.
Rosenstein's appointment of Mueller was prompted by Sessions' recusal from the inquiry because of his work for the Trump campaign. The recusal ultimately led to Sessions' firing following the November midterm elections.
If confirmed, Barr would assume management of the Mueller investigation, widely believed to be in its final stages. Rosenstein has continued to help oversee the inquiry since the November appointment of acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker, the interim replacement for Sessions.
Barr, meanwhile, was on Capitol Hill Wednesday, meeting with lawmakers in advance of next week's hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Barr was attorney general from 1991-93 during George H.W. Bush administration.
Asked about Rosenstein's status, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said Wednesday that the deputy attorney general had long planned to serve two years. He was confirmed by the Senate in April 2017.
"I know (Rosenstein) has a great deal of respect for the new nominee for attorney general, Mr. Barr," Sanders said on Fox News. "And I think they have a great relationship.
"I haven't spoken to the deputy attorney general myself, so I'll leave any announcement for him or the president to make when they want to do that. But certainly I don't think there's any willingness by the president or White House to push him out. My guess is that he is making room for the new attorney general to build a team he wants around him."
Rosenstein had considered resigning from his post as recently as September in the wake of a New York Times report indicating that the deputy attorney general had suggested invoking the 25th Amendment last year to remove Trump.
Rosenstein has strongly denied the report, which indicated that he suggested recording Trump's conversations in hopes of triggering the president's removal from office.
Democrats expressed deep concern Wednesday about Rosenstein's pending departure. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said the development only "heightens the stakes" for Barr's looming confirmation hearing.

Texto completo: TEHRAN, Iran - Iran confirmed Wednesday it is holding U.S. Navy veteran Michael White at a prison in the country, making him the first American known to be detained during President Donald Trump's administration.
White's detention adds new pressure to the tension between Iran and the U.S., which under Trump has pursued a maximalist campaign against Tehran that includes pulling out of its nuclear deal with world powers.
Although the circumstances of White's detention remain unclear, Iran in the past has used its detention of Westerners and dual nationals as leverage in negotiations.
The semi-official Tasnim news agency, believed to be close to the paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, reported the confirmation, citing Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Ghasemi.
"An American citizen was arrested in the city of Mashhad some time ago and his case was conveyed to the U.S administration on the first days" of his incarceration, Ghasemi was quoted as saying.
The State Department said it was aware of reports of an American citizen's arrest, but was otherwise unable to comment.
White's mother, Joanne White, had told The New York Times that her 46-year-old son, who lives in Imperial Beach, Calif., went to Iran to see his girlfriend and had booked a July 27 flight back home to San Diego via the United Arab Emirates. She filed a missing person report with the State Department after he did not board the flight. She added that he had been undergoing treatment for a neck tumor and has asthma.
Comatose woman who had baby is hospitalized, police say
PHOENIX - An Arizona woman in a vegetative state who was sexually assaulted at a long-term care facility and had a baby is recovering at a hospital along with her child, authorities said Wednesday.
Commenting for the first time on the investigation since the Dec. 29 birth came to light, Phoenix police said finding a suspect is a top priority. Police are gathering DNA from all male employees at the facility.
Hacienda HealthCare owns the care facility and said it welcomed the DNA testing. Authorities served a search warrant Tuesday.
Local news website Azfamily.com first reported that the woman in a vegetative state for more than 10 years after a near-drowning had given birth to a boy.
It's unclear if staff members at the facility were aware of her pregnancy until the birth.
Republican senator signals interest in Trump's tax returns
WASHINGTON - Senate Finance Chairman Chuck Grassley said he's examining his authority to obtain President Donald Trump's tax returns, a move to ensure he could see any forms his Democratic counterpart in the House potentially receives.
Grassley said he's planning to meet with nonpartisan congressional tax advisers to learn more about the process. Under a decades-old law, the heads of the tax-writing committees in Congress can request the tax returns of any taxpayer, including the president, from the Treasury Department.
Still, the Iowa Republican cautioned Wednesday that he hasn't yet made a decision about whether he would ask Treasury to release the documents. Trump refused to release his tax returns during the 2016 campaign.
Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and wife divorcing after 25 years
SEATTLE - Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and his wife, MacKenzie, are divorcing, ending a 25-year marriage that played a role in the creation of an e-commerce company that made Bezos one of the world's wealthiest people.
The decision to divorce comes after a trial separation, according to a statement posted Wednesday on his Twitter account.
Left unanswered was how the assets amassed during the marriage will be divided.
Jeff Bezos' fortune hovers around $137 billion, according to estimates by Forbes and Bloomberg. Virtually all of that is tied up in the nearly 79 million shares of Amazon stock (currently worth about $130 billion) that he owns.
Because they married before Amazon was founded, it's likely that MacKenzie Bezos holds a large claim to that fortune.
Jury sees El Chapo texts sent to wife while on run
NEW YORK - Text messages exchanged between notorious Mexican drug lord Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman and his wife while he was on the run in 2012 surfaced Wednesday at his U.S. trial, evidence the FBI says it uncovered with the help of a tech for the cartel who flipped on the kingpin.
The tech, Christian Rodriguez, also testified how Guzman was obsessed with spyware he had Rodriguez install on mobile phones he gave to members of his inner circle to keep an eye on them. The software churned out reports on phone activity that are being used against Guzman.
Also saved were text messages between Guzman and his wife, Emma Coronel Aispuro, in which they touched on logistics for drug smuggling and shared encouragement as he fled a raid by authorities on a mansion in Cabo San Lucas, Baja.
Feds: Former commander at Gitmo slowed death probe
WASHINGTON - A former commander of the Navy base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, was arrested Wednesday on charges that he interfered with the investigation into the death of a civilian with whom he fought after an argument over whether the officer had an affair with the man's wife.
Navy Capt. John Nettleton remains on active duty, but he was removed from command shortly after civilian Christopher Tur was found floating in January 2015 in the waters off the base on the southeastern coast of Cuba.
Nettleton denied to his superior officer and others that he had the affair, but investigators later determined that it had happened, according to a federal indictment.
Nettleton was commander of the base since June 2012, but not the prison where suspected terrorists are held.
In LA: The union representing teachers in the nation's second-largest school district postponed a strike until Monday because of the possibility of a court-ordered delay. United Teachers Los Angeles had said its 35,000 members would walk off the job Thursday if a deal wasn't reached on pay raises and smaller classes.
Seeking asylum: A Saudi woman who fled her family to Thailand, alleging abuse, moved a step closer Wednesday to her goal of gaining asylum in Australia after a U.N. agency granted her refugee status.
Rahaf Mohammed Alqunun's father denied physically abusing her or trying to force her into an arranged marriage.

Texto completo: Tennis is well known as the "Sport for a Lifetime" and medical science reveals why. For those making New Year's resolutions, tennis burns a lot of calories and is an excellent form of exercise. In fact, competitive tennis burns more calories than aerobics, inline skating, or cycling. A typical singles player burns 300 to 660 calories an hour playing recreationally. Doubles players burn from 200 - 460 calories an hour.
Tennis is a active sport with short bursts of intense activity during a point followed by a brief period of rest. Since this kind of interval training occurs naturally in tennis, the body's muscles have to use oxygen more efficiently and to burn more calories than constant motion exercising.
In September, Gretchen Reynolds wrote in the New York Times about a new epidemiological study of Danish men and women that concluded that playing tennis could add years to one's life. The study found that adults who participated often in tennis and other team sports lived longer than sedentary people. They also lived longer than people who practice such solitary sports as jogging, swimming and cycling.
The Copenhagen City Heart Study, published in the Mayo Clinic Proceedings, confirmed other studies that have noticed a beneficial effect from social sports. No one doubts that exercise contributes to health and longevity. It appears that the social benefits of tennis are a bonus. As Dr. James O'Keefe, a study co-author, said, "Raising your heart rate is important, but it looks like connecting with other people is, too."
The study compared the life spans of 8,600 Danish adults over 25 years. All but a 1,000 of them were exercisers. The researchers found that tennis players had the biggest gains in life expectancy over sedentary people, adding 9.7 years to their lives. This was followed by badminton (6.7 years), cycling (3.7 years), swimming (3.4 years), jogging (3.2 years) and low-intensity calisthenics (3.1 years). Health club workouts with treadmills or weights added just 1.5 years.
According to Dr. Jim Gavin, who wrote the "The Exercise Habit", tennis is better than most other sports in developing positive personality characteristics such as teamwork, friendship, and competitiveness. Meanwhile, Dr. Joan Finn at the Southern Connecticut State University found that tennis players also ranked higher in vigor, optimism and self-esteem and reported less depression, anger, and anxiety. Scientists have also found that tennis can promote a lifetime of brain development because tennis requires alertness and tactical thinking. Emotionally, tennis contributes to personal discipline, good sportsmanship, and resiliency.
COACHES CLINIC: The USTA Mid-Atlantic Section will sponsor a High School Coaches Workshop on Feb. 3 at the Junior Tennis Champions Center in College Park from 9:30 am to 3:00 pm.

Democrats, intelligence experts think Manafort filing reveals 'collusion'

Texto completo: Democrats and intelligence experts from both political parties believe information that was accidentally revealed in a court filing from Paul Manafort's lawyers could be the biggest link yet to President Trump and Russia.

Manafort, while serving as the campaign manager for President Trump’s campaign, shared political polling data with a business associate who also had ties to Russian intelligence. The disclosure occurred by accident after the court filing, which was in response to accusations that Manafort lied during his plea deal agreement with special counsel Robert Mueller, was not properly formatted to block out information meant to be redacted.

After a year of lobbing accusations against Trump that he colluded with Russia to win the 2016 election, Democrats think they have finally hit pay dirt.

“Internal polling data is precious. It reveals your strengths — & your weaknesses. Why share such valuable information with a foreign adversary — unless that adversary was really a friend?” said Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn.

Mike McFaul, who served as the U.S. ambassador to Russia from 2012 to 2014 under President Barack Obama and is now a professor at Stanford University, said on Twitter: “If proven, then call it by whatever c word that you want — collusion, cooperation, conspiracy — but this is serous.”

It is unclear what data Manafort shared, but the failed redactions show he allegedly gave the information to Konstantin Kilimnik, who has also been charged by the special counsel. It is also unclear how Kilimnik might have used the information.

The New York Times reported this week that Manafort and Rick Gates, the deputy campaign manager, transferred the data to Kilimnik in spring 2016, around the time Trump clinched the presidential nomination.

Most of the data was public, according to the Times report, “but some of it was developed by a private polling firm working for the campaign,” a person knowledgeable about the situation said.

Manafort wanted the data to be sent to two Ukrainian oligarchs, Serhiy Lyovochkin and Rinat Akhmetov, the Times reported. Both men had financed Russian-aligned Ukrainian parties that had previously hired Manafort as a political consultant.

The court filing also revealed that Manafort has been accused by Mueller of lying about discussing a Ukrainian peace plan with Kilimnik during the 2016 campaign and that Manafort also “acknowledged” that he met with Kilimnik while they were both in Madrid.

Jason Maloni, a spokesman for Manafort, said the Madrid meeting took place in January or February 2017, after his work on the presidential campaign was finished.

But others think there's enough information there to show that Manafort was somehow working with Russia.

“The margins the Russians needed to change in key states during the 2016 elections was pretty small. Now we know how they were able to be so precise: Paul Manafort was providing polling data to Russia,” said Steven Hall, the former chief of Russia operations for the CIA, in a tweet.

He later added: "[t]he next logical step is to tie in the fact that we know the Russians wanted to help elect Trump and hurt his opponent. It appears that Manafort and Putin had the same goal, and that Manafort was trying to help the Kremlin."

John Dean, a White House counsel under President Richard Nixon convicted for his role in Watergate, said: “Big story. New info. Both Paul Manafort and Rick Gates, Trump’s top campaign managers, transferred inside polling data to Russian intel guy Kilimnik in the spring of 2016 as Trump clinched the Republican presidential nomination. It’s called COLLUSION!”

The top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee called the revelation about Manafort “one of the most significant activities of this whole investigation.”

“This appears as the closest we’ve seen yet to real live actual collusion. Clearly, Manafort was trying to collude with Russian agents, and the question is, 'What did the president know?'” said Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., in an interview with CNN that aired Wednesday. “How is that not evidence of an effort to collaborate?”

He added: “If it’s true that Manafort as campaign chair shared internal polling data with Kilimnik, he was giving the Russians information that would have been useful for their intelligence operation.”

Mueller’s team will respond to the Manafort court filing no later than Monday at midnight, and there is a possibility that more details of the allegations will be revealed.

“Manafort's lawyers' general characterization of Mueller's allegations about Manafort's conduct in the context of a dispute over whether Manafort violated his plea agreement or not offers a highly imperfect window into Mueller's understanding of that evidence and how it fits into the larger picture of interactions between the Trump campaign and the Russian state. We will not know what these tidbits mean, if anything, until we see both how Mueller characterizes them and, more particularly, how Mueller situates them against that broader pattern of interactions,” wrote Benjamin Wittes, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, in a blog post Wednesday.

Texto completo: Six award-winning and best-selling authors will travel to Des Moines this spring as part of the Des Moines Public Library's AViD author series in 2019.
The series, dubbed Authors Visiting in Des Moines, began in 2001 as a way to bring local and nationally-renowned authors to Des Moines.
"The idea was to provide our patrons with a way to see these national, accomplished authors for free without reservations or tickets," said Tim Paluch, Des Moines Public Library spokesman. "They can hear from these people on a more personal level."
The AViD series is funded by the library foundation and lasts throughout the spring. Each talk and book signing is scheduled for weeknights at 7 p.m. and attracts about 200-300 attendees.
"That's so (audience members) can just stop in without losing their weekend plans," Paluch said. "It expands horizons for some of our readers, and gives everyone a chance to see some accomplished literary icons."
For the 2019 lineup, organizers have taken special care to select authors who have written about topics relevant to current local and national issues such as economic inequality in the Midwest, Paluch said.
"This year's lineup is very exciting and interesting," Paluch said. "We have authors writing about raising a transgender child. C.J. Chivers wrote about the fighters and the effects of war on the combatants on the ground. We find not just good books, but books that provide engaging discussion and are relevant to Central Iowans and everybody."
Another author to note is Chigozie Obioma, a Nigerian-American, who wrote the acclaimed novel "The Fishermen." Obioma's latest book, "An Orchestra of Minorities," is a twist on Homer's "Odyssey" and is set to release Jan. 8.
"Some might not know his name yet, but they're going to be seeing him in coming months," Paluch said.
Susan Orlean, author of "The Library Book" and "The Orchid Thief," will be the first author to visit Des Moines during the 2019 AViD series. AViD is sponsoring Orlean at the DSM Book Festival at 4 p.m. on March 30.
The other events will take place at the Des Moines Public Library Central Library at 7 p.m.
AViD series lineup March 30: Susan Orlean at the DSM Book Festival. She is the author of the critically-acclaimed 2018 best-seller "The Library Book," a love letter to libraries that doubles as a true crime exploration of the unsolved 1986 fire that damaged the Los Angeles Public Library. Orlean's 1998 nonfiction classic, "The Orchid Thief," was adapted into a feature film, "Adaptation."
April 18: Laurie Frankel. She's the author of the best-selling 2017 novel "This is How It Always Is," which tells the story of a family struggling with the challenges of raising a transgender child. The story is fiction, but the author is the mother of a transgender child herself. The book was chosen as a Reese Witherspoon Hello Sunshine Book Club pick in fall 2018.
April 22: Chigozie Obioma. The Nigerian-born author burst onto the literary scene in 2015 with his debut novel, "The Fishermen," which won multiple national and international awards — including an NAACP Image Award — and was a finalist for the prestigious Man Booker Prize. That same year he was named one of Foreign Policy's 100 Leading Global Thinkers. His much-anticipated second novel, "An Orchestra of Minorities" is a twist on Homer's "Odyssey" written in the style of the Nigerian Igbo tradition.
May 2: Sarah Smarsh. Journalist, educator and author Sarah Smarsh's debut book, "Heartland: A Memoir of Working Hard and Being Broke in the Richest Country on Earth," was an instant best-seller upon release in 2018. It was a finalist for the Kirkus Prize and National Book Award. Heartland was named one of the best books of 2018 by NPR, Amazon, Audible, Publisher's Weekly and more. The book examines America's historic economic inequality and tells the story of her upbringing among the working poor of rural Kansas.
May 16: Madeline Miller. Madeline Miller's 2018 novel, "Circe," was a New York Times No. 1 best-seller and appeared on dozens of "Best Books of 2018" lists, including NPR, People, The Washington Post, Time, Entertainment Weekly, Buzzfeed, Book Riot and more. "Circe" was also named the Booklist 2018 Book of the Year. The novel, a retelling of the story of the villainous goddess Circe, recasts the infamous figure from "The Odyssey" into a feminist hero.
May 23: C.J. Chivers. Journalist C.J. Chivers is one of this generation's most revered war correspondents and a two-time Pulitzer Prize winner for The New York Times. His magazine story, "The Fighter," won the 2017 Pulitzer Prize in feature writing. Chivers served as an infantry officer in the U.S. Marine Corps in the Persian Gulf War. In 2018, he released "The Fighters," a vivid account of modern warfare told through the stories of a half-dozen American combatants serving in the Middle East conflicts. The book explores the growing disconnect between military leaders making decisions and the men and women on the ground facing the dangerous consequences of those decisions.

President Trump, Gov. Newsom share similar, self-created problem

Texto completo: "Guaranteed health care for all" is Newsom's "big beautiful wall."
Gov. Gavin Newsom punctuated his inaugural address this week with several jabs at President Donald Trump, referring at one point to "the corruption and incompetence in the White House."
However, while neither man would admit it, they share a similar political problem. Having made extravagant promises to gain support from partisan bases, they now must deliver or somehow wriggle out of them.
The New York Times revealed recently that Trump's pledge to build "a big beautiful wall" along the U.S.-Mexico border to deter immigration was never a fully vetted proposal, but a throwaway line in his stump speech.
When the wall promise galvanized voters in key industrial states, Trump was stuck with it. But with Congress balking, it led to a partial shutdown of the federal government.
In seeking the governorship last year, Newsom also made extravagant promises aimed at the ascendant Berniecrat wing of his Democratic Party. He told those on the left what they wanted to hear and on primary election night in June, promising "Guaranteed health care for all. A 'Marshall Plan' for affordable housing. A master plan for aging with dignity. A middle-class workforce strategy. A cradle-to-college promise for the next generation. An all-hands approach to ending child poverty."
After winning the governorship in November, however, Newsom began to step back, cognizant that delivering on his promises would cost many tens of billions of dollars.
While some of those promises might be feasible, "Guaranteed health care for all" is Newsom's "big beautiful wall" — something that draws cheers from the faithful but would be virtually impossible to deliver.
Tellingly, during a pre-inaugural event on Sunday, Newsom said, "Anyone who suggests that you can create universal this or universal that, even if you wanted to in six months to a year, our capacity to deliver on that is limited, so we're going to create the architecture, the framework, we'll set the goals."
Setting a goal is easy. You just say it, send out a press release or even write it into law. Reaching the goal is something else entirely.
Newsom kissed off universal health care in a few words during his 2,700-plus-word inaugural address, saying, "In our home (of California), every person should have access to quality, affordable health care," while pledging, "we will never waver in our pursuit of guaranteed health care for all Californians."
It's doubtful that the fervent advocates of universal health care will be placated by such a vague statement or even his initial actions to extend Medi-Cal coverage to a few more undocumented immigrants and offer health insurance subsidies to middle-class families.
The advocates, led by the California Nurses Association, want nothing short of universal, single-payer coverage.
Nor will California political media forget about universal health care and the other specific promises that Newsom made last year, such as building 3.5 million new homes in six years.
CALmatters and the Sacramento Bee have already documented those promises and will chart his progress on delivery. Politifact, which specializes in separating fact from political fiction, has set up a "Newsom-Meter" for that same purpose.
Newsom's predecessor, Jerry Brown, stumbled badly in his first stint as governor 40 years ago by doing 180-degree flips of position. He was more cautious during his second governorship, making few specific promises, delivering on those he made and avoiding battles he thought he couldn't win.
Newsom talks about having "audacious hairy goals," but promising too much and reneging would make him appear flaky. He could ask Brown about the corrosive effect of that image on one's political career.
CALmatters is a public interest journalism venture committed to explaining how California's state Capitol works and why it matters. For more stories by Dan Walters, go to calmatters.org/commentary

Democrats' bill would add background checks

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — House Democrats, seeking a politically charged debate on gun control, unveiled legislation Tuesday to expand background checks to nearly all firearms purchases, a move timed to mark the eighth anniversary of the mass shooting in Arizona that nearly killed former US representative Gabrielle Giffords.
By introducing the measure less than one week after taking control of the House, Democrats are signaling that it is a top priority. A vote could come within the first 100 days of the new Congress.
The bill, which will almost certainly pass the House but face a steep climb in the Republican-controlled Senate, would require background checks on the purchases of nearly all firearms, including those sold at gun shows and over the Internet. There would be limited exceptions.
Polls have shown that most Americans — by some estimates, 90 percent — support universal background checks for all gun purchases.
By limiting the bill to background checks — and keeping out other provisions such as a ban on assault rifles or high-capacity magazines — gun safety advocates hope to pressure Republicans on a policy that has broad public support. In the Senate, Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, will have to decide whether to bring up the bill. In the House, Republicans will be forced to vote on it.
But by narrowing the bill so dramatically, Democrats may also limit its utility. Suspects in many recent high-profile mass shootings had passed background checks when purchasing their weapons.
Even so, gun law changes rarely make it through Congress. The measure is similar to one in 2012 that fell to a bipartisan filibuster in 2013 in a Senate controlled by Democrats.
Then as now, the National Rifle Association opposed the measure.

Supreme Court lets stand subpoena linked to Mueller
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court on Tuesday left in place a lower court order requiring an unnamed foreign-owned corporation to comply with a subpoena said to be part of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's probe of Russian interference in the 2016 election.
The court dissolved a temporary stay put in place by Chief Justice John Roberts.
The entity that is the subject of the cloaked legal battle — known in court papers simply as a "Corporation" from "Country A" — is a foreign financial institution that was issued a subpoena by a grand jury hearing evidence in the special counsel investigation, according to two people familiar with the case.
It is thought to be the first time that an aspect of Mueller's wide-ranging probe into Russian interference in the 2016 campaign has reached the Supreme Court.

Texto completo: An investigation is underway examining the death of an American civilian defense contractor in Erbil, Iraq, according to a new report. The investigation has honed in on two U.S. Marines and a Navy corpsman, who were assigned to a Marine Special Operations unit in northern Iraq.

The contractor, who was employed by Lockheed Martin, was reportedly injured during a physical altercation on New Year's Eve before being transported to Landstuhl, Germany, Defense Department officials told The New York Times, who was the first to report the news. The unidentified victim was pronounced dead on Jan. 4.

A spokesperson for the Naval Criminal Investigative Service declined to provide comment on the details of the probe, as it is ongoing, per the New York Times.

Lockheed Martin told The New York Times it “was saddened to learn of the loss of one of our employees, who was fatally injured while supporting Special Operations Forces within the Operation Inherent Resolve area of operations in a noncombat-related incident.”

“Our thoughts are with his family and friends, and we are committed to supporting them during this difficult time,” Lockheed Martin said.

The contractor’s death is the latest incident of deathly misconduct among elite U.S. forces. For example, two Navy SEALs and two Marines in November were charged with murdering Army Staff Sgt. Logan Melgar. Melgar was found strangled in Mali in 2017.

Approximately 5,000 U.S. troops remain in Iraq, and are primarily responsible for aiding the Iraqi military in combating extremists.

Texto completo: For the driverless car industry, 2018 saw technology breakthroughs. Unfortunately, the year also was a public relations disaster.
An experimental Uber driverless car, with an inattentive "safety driver" at the wheel, ran over and killed a woman walking her bicycle across a highway in Arizona.
A U.S. Senate bill that would have allowed hundreds of thousands of robot cars on the nation's highways stalled in part over safety concerns.

Waymo, the acknowledged leader, slowed deployment of its long-planned driverless taxi service near Phoenix, limiting it to several hundred handpicked customers and keeping human engineers inside the car. Later, the New York Times revealed that some of those Waymo cars are being attacked with rocks and knives.
To cap the year, Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk appeared on "60 Minutes" driving down a Silicon Valley highway behind the wheel of a Model 3, his hands in the air and a grin on his face, to show correspondent Lesley Stahl how the car can drive itself. Critics pointed out that Tesla's Autopilot is not driverless technology, that several people have been killed apparently using Autopilot improperly, and that Tesla owner manuals instruct drivers to keep their hands on the wheel.
That gives a good sense of why driverless companies felt the need to form a wide-ranging consortium whose aim is to change the way the public views the industry.
Partners for Automated Vehicle Education, or PAVE, which was unveiled Monday at the CES technology trade show in Las Vegas, includes carmakers Audi, General Motors, Volkswagen, Toyota and Daimler; driverless technology companies Waymo, Cruise, Aurora and Zoox; and computer chip makers Intel, Nvidia and Mobileye.
The group said it will "seek to bring realistic, factual information to policymakers and the public so consumers and decision makers understand the technology, its current state and its future potential -- including the benefits in safety, mobility and sustainability."
"We want to make sure that consumers and policymakers understand what's real, what's possible and what is rumor or speculation," said Brad Stertz, head of government affairs in the U.S. for Audi.
In 2017, Stertz discussed the industry's public image at a Silicon Valley restaurant with Mark Rosekind, former head of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, now in charge of "safety innovation" at Zoox, a driverless car start-up. There is too much confusion about the technology, they agreed. Some people fear it. Some people are overenthusiastic about its current state.
The driverless car narrative needed changing, they decided. But it couldn't be done simply with public relations spin. An objective, factual education approach was required, they decided.
Critics point out that many of PAVE's members have a stake in the driverless future. They are skeptical that the group will be objective.
"A corporate coalition of technology profiteers claiming to focus on safety is akin to the tobacco companies telling us they have a safer way to deliver nicotine," said Jack Gillis, executive director of the Consumer Federation of America.
But Kelly Nantel, vice president for communications and advocacy at the National Safety Council, a member of PAVE, said that "the power of the group is its diversity." She notes that although its 20 founding members include major automakers, they are joined by the National Council on Aging, the National Federation of the Blind, the Miami-Dade County government and her group.
PAVE "is not a lobbying group at all," Nantel said, and it won't take a position on any federal, state or local legislation.
Mark Riccobono, president of the National Federation of the Blind, said he's been pushing auto manufacturers for years to make sure the interfaces inside driverless cars can accommodate the visually impaired. PACE, he said, gives him a seat at the table.
"We have the expectation that these are going to be used in public service fleets, and they have to be accessible to us from the beginning," Riccobono said. Driverless cars, for obvious reasons, could vastly improve the lives of those who can't see well enough to qualify for a driver's license.
PACE plans a public website and educational workshops with policymakers. Stanford University's Center for Automotive Research will be a partner. Events will be held around the country so that politicians and the general public can "see, touch and feel" driverless cars -- and ride in them.
The group faces serious public perception challenges. Although the carnage caused by human drivers is obvious -- nearly 40,000 people killed by cars in the U.S. annually, the vast majority of cases being the fault of the driver, not the car -- the driverless industry has millions of road miles to go to prove with statistics how safe driverless cars are compared with human drivers. And the only way to prove that is to put cars on the road.
The public is wary. A Gallup poll in May asked people whether they would use driverless cars if they were available today and certified by government safety agencies. Only 9% said they would use one as soon as possible, 38% said they'd wait a while, and 52% said they'd never use one.
Some PAVE members believe that some companies and driverless proponents are hyping driver-assist technology -- which might offer adaptive cruise control, lane keeping and lane changing -- as driverless technology. "If you believe a car is self-driving, your behavior is going to be different than if you know you have to be always engaged as a driver," as is the case in every automobile now being sold, Nantel said.
She used Tesla's Autopilot as an example. "For the average consumer, calling something Autopilot implies it's self-driving technology, when it's really driver assistance technology. We've created an environment where consumers don't understand the limitation of the technology."
Musk has long insisted that the word Autopilot causes no confusion. Neither Tesla nor Uber is among PAVE's 20 founding members. It's unclear whether they chose not to join or were not invited. Tesla hasn't responded to a request for comment, and Uber declined to discuss the matter.
Some critics say driverless tech advocates could advance their cause by doing more to improve safety now and adding safety technology to conventional vehicles.
"Effective, advanced technologies are available today including automatic emergency braking, lane departure warning and blind-spot detection," said Cathy Chase, president of Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety. "However, these technologies are typically only available in high-end models or expensive trim packages."
Jason Levine, executive director of the Center for Auto Safety, said that although PAVE may be emphasizing education, the driverless industry had been criticized for a lack of transparency, especially in the aftermath of serious accidents.
"Consumers deserve publicly disclosed, objective, measurable, verifiable and quantitative test results before driverless vehicles are allowed to be introduced to commerce," he said.

Texto completo: New horror stories of newsroom sexual misconduct are expected to be dished later this month when media big shots head to the Newseum for a second #MeToo summit. The first summit took place a year ago and “focused on newsroom culture that protects the powerful, lacks diversity and discourages open conversation about the factors that play a major role in sexual misconduct,” said Power Shift Project organizers. The next summit on Jan. 15 will see if those problems have been fixed and if new scandals exist. Among those heading to Washington include Politico editor Carrie Budoff Brown, New Yorker writer Jane Mayer, Vox Editor Lauren Williams, Loren Mayor, president of operations at NPR, and Carolyn Ryan, assistant editor of the New York Times.
• Newly retired former House Speaker Paul Ryan’s staff are on the move, with several putting out notes in their last days. Top aide Brendan Buck said he’s “taking a little time” before settling into a new post. Press Secretary AshLee Strong plans to “ski my way across my beloved home state of Montana.” And Jeffrey Dressler, Ryan’s national security aide, has joined Softbank in Washington.
• The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee is hiring up as it readies for the 2020 election cycle. Incoming Chair Rep. Cheri Bustos of Illinois, already talked about as a future House speaker, has 10 positions open, several in the outreach and communications office.
• New Arizona Sen. Martha McSally isn’t just joining the most exclusive legislative body in the world, but she also is a member of a very tiny group: those who lost an election and then were appointed to the Senate. She is the ninth-ever to be appointed to the Senate after losing. She lost to new Arizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema. McSally replaces Sen. Jon Kyl who took the late Sen. John McCain’s seat. The 55-days between her defeat and seating in the Senate is the shortest ever, according to Eric J. Ostermeier, who runs the “Smart Politics” blog at the University of Minnesota.

A warning for Trump in George Washington death plot

Texto completo: He was the father of the country, but that doesn’t mean everybody loved George Washington.
firstconspirarcy-cover.jpg
According to a new historical book from thriller author Brad Meltzer, Washington was targeted for assassination by his own bodyguards. But the nation’s first president found out first and strung up one of the plotters in a hanging before 20,000.

In the First Conspiracy: The Secret Plot to Kill George Washington , Meltzer and co-writer and documentary producer Josh Mensch unveil their research on the scheme that occurred just days before the 1776 signing of the Declaration of Independence.

Set for a Jan. 8 release, the book also reveals the first efforts by the federal government to set up intelligence operations that the FBI and CIA are now known for.

Meltzer said his book may have a lesson for today’s politics and even President Trump.

“George Washington was loved, and they were plotting against him. So if you think there couldn’t be a plot today, you’re not paying attention,” said the New York Times bestseller.

“If I were Trump, I’d read about how George Washington fought back against those plotting against him. Washington launched secret committees to deal with those trying to infiltrate our government — and fought with all his might to bring the country together. It’s good advice, back then and today,” added Meltzer.

Texto completo: Susan Zirinsky, the longtime producer of "48 Hours" on CBS, will replace David Rhodes as the president of the network's news division in March, the company said Sunday night.
The surprising announcement was the latest major personnel change for CBS, which also forced out Leslie Moonves, the company's longtime chief executive, in September after multiple accusations of sexual misconduct.
The news division, which has struggled in the ratings, has weathered significant upheaval in the last year. Charlie Rose, the anchor of the morning show, was fired in November 2017 after multiple women accused him of sexual misconduct. Jeff Fager, the longtime executive producer of "60 Minutes," was fired by Mr. Rhodes in September after he threatened a reporter and colleague looking into allegations of sexual harassment against him. And Ryan Kadro, the executive producer of "CBS This Morning," announced last month that he was departing.
Mr. Rhodes' contract was set to expire early this year but his departure was not expected within the ranks of the news division. In fact, over the last few months, he has been weighing who should replace Mr. Fager at "60 Minutes." Ms. Zirinsky was the leading candidate for the position. Now she will decide who will take over the program.
In a Sunday night email to the staff, the acting CBS chief executive, Joe Ianniello, said that Mr. Rhodes "decided the time is right to move on to new opportunities."
Of Ms. Zirinsky, he wrote, "I can think of no one more equipped than 'Z' for the job, and we are delighted she has welcomed these new responsibilities."
Ms. Zirinsky, 66, has been with CBS News for more than 40 years and has touched almost every part of the division, from its morning show to its evening newscast and its coverage of the White House before joining "48 Hours" in 1996. She was the inspiration for Holly Hunter's character in the 1987 movie "Broadcast News."
She now is one of a very small number of women who have been elevated to the position of network news division head.
"I have been honored to work closely throughout my career with great CBS News journalists," Ms. Zirinsky said in a statement. "This may be a new role, but the mission is the same: deliver quality, in-depth journalism and engaging storytelling. CBS News has an incredible legacy to build on."
Suggesting that ratings could be improved, Ms. Zirinsky added, "The public's interest today for news and information is intense, and CBS News is uniquely positioned to expand its reach."
Mr. Rhodes, who became the president of CBS News in 2011, oversaw several key changes at the network, including at its evening news program and Sunday public affairs programs, as well as a revamp of its morning show. He also introduced the network's 24-hour digital news channel, CBSN.
But CBS News was the subject of an investigation into the larger cultural issues at the company undertaken after the misconduct allegations against Mr. Moonves became public. (Mr. Moonves has denied all the allegations and said any sexual acts he engaged in were consensual.) The investigation, which was conducted by two outside law firms, concluded that though there were several issues that could be improved -- including at "60 Minutes" and in the promotion of women into key positions -- the news division did not have "a toxic work or 'frat house' environment for women," according to a draft report of the inquiry reviewed by The New York Times.
But since Mr. Rose's firing from the network's weekday morning show -- and the appointment of John Dickerson to replace him -- ratings for "CBS This Morning" have plummeted. Additionally, a change at the helm of "CBS Evening News" -- from Scott Pelley, with whom Mr. Rhodes had a strained relationship, to Jeff Glor -- has been rocky.
"The new year is a time for renewal, for new goals," Mr. Rhodes said in an email to the staff on Sunday night. "The world we cover is changing, how we cover it is changing -- and it's the right time for me to make a change too."

Texto completo: Sick days among Transportation Security Administration employees have increased since a partial government shutdown beginning Dec. 22 left TSA personnel working without pay, the agency announced Friday.
An increase in call-outs — workers who say they are too sick to work their shifts — started over the holidays and has grown, but the phenomenon is causing a "minimal impact" on the security screening process at airports, the agency says in a tweet.
"Security effectiveness will not be compromised and performance standards will not change ... To date, however, screening wait times remain well within TSA standards," the statement said.
The information was released as a response to a CNN report saying mass TSA worker call-outs had affected four major airports. The New York Times also reported on the call-outs.
Of the 2.2 million passengers screened by the agency Thursday, 99.8 percent waited less than 30 minutes, according to the TSA statement.
As the shutdown enters its third week, tens of thousands of TSA agents are among federal employees who are working without pay.
President Donald Trump and lawmakers emerged Friday afternoon from their latest round of talks at the White House only to indicate that an agreement to end the partial shutdown could be a long way off. The shutdown occurred over Trump's demand for $5.6 billion to help pay for a border wall.

Texto completo: Depending on who you talk to, dieting is life-changing, terrible for you, optimistic, misguided, will keep you alive or put you in an early grave.
Then there's all that lingo that comes with mastering the biological theories behind dieting, like ketosis and alkaline and lectin — phrases that make you feel like you're in a science class rather than just trying to shed a few pounds or live a healthier life.
Have no fear, because we've got a simplified guide for you about the trendiest diets of the new year — that self-conscious time when everyone's re-evaluating their lifestyle.
U.S. News and World Report has released its annual rankings of the Best Diets for 2019, revealing the Mediterranean diet was the best overall choice.
Each diet description below is a rating of its effectiveness, based on U.S. News and World Report rankings. We've included their findings, based on input from a panel of health experts, on weight loss and healthiness for each diet. While doing this study they took into account the diet being "relatively easy to follow, nutritious, safe, effective for weight loss and protective against diabetes and heart disease."
Here are the diet trends you're likely to see referenced in celebrity Instagram captions this year.
Ketogenic Perhaps the biggest fad that's riding its wave of popularity right into 2019 is the Ketogenic, or "Keto," diet. Celebs like Kourtney Kardashian, Al Roker and Vinny Guadagnino (who affectionately went by the nickname "Keto Guido" on the new seasons of "Jersey Shore") have popularized the diet. Ketogenic diets are low on carbs and high on fat, which puts the body in a state of ketosis. Ketosis is a metabolic state that happens when your body doesn't have enough carbohydrates for your cells to burn for energy. So, instead, it burns fat. The Keto diet is very effective at slimming your waistline, but does cause huge changes to your body that aren't always positive. U.S. News & World Report says that changing the way your body is fueled from carbs to fat can lead to leg cramps, dehydration, brain fog, dizziness and more.
U.S. News & World Report: 3.1/5 Weight Loss | 1.5/5 Healthy
Paleo The philosophy of this diet is in the name. The Paleo diet encourages people to eat foods that would have been available to our Paleolithic ancestors. In case you need to brush up on your high school science, the Paleolithic era started 2.5 million years ago. Basically, with this diet you're looking at meals that could either be hunted or gathered — lean meats, fish, vegetables, nuts and seeds. And, because farming hadn't been developed yet in the Paleolithic era, Paleo dieters are expected to cut out foods that became popularized through farming like dairy products, legumes and grains, as well. Those who follow the Paleo diet believe that modern eating habits don't suit our prehistoric genetic makeup, so we should return to Stone Age-approved meals.
U.S. News & World Report: 2.5/5 Weight Loss | 2.7/5 Healthy
Alkaline Diet Acid is the enemy of the Alkaline diet. The thought behind this diet is to cut out foods that cause your body to produce acid – including meat, wheat, refined sugar, processed foods, dairy, eggs, canned food, packaged snacks, caffeine and alcohol. You may be thinking: what else is there to eat? The Alkaline diet approves of most fruits and vegetables, nuts, legumes, soybeans and tofu. These are foods that are alkaline — in other words have a pH value of 7, which is neutral, or above. Foods with a pH value below 7 are acidic, and therefore a no-go. That said, there is no solid science to support that regulating the pH values of your food will change the overall pH balance of your body. It will do that naturally. However, in general, eating a lot of fruits and veggies and avoiding processed foods will make you lose weight.
U.S. News & World Report: 2.1/5 Weight Loss | 3.0/5 Healthy
Whole30 A popular diet that spurred a New York Times bestselling book, Whole30 encourages people to eat foods with as few ingredients as possible, and all those ingredients should be substances you know and can pronounce. The program's website claims that if you completely avoid foods such as alcohol, anything with added sugar, legumes, dairy and more, for 30 days, you will "eliminate cravings, restore a healthy metabolism, heal the digestive tract, reduce systemic inflammation, and discover how these foods are truly impacting how you look, how you feel, and your quality of life." This program also advocates not stepping on a scale, to make the diet more about health than weight loss.
U.S. News & World Report: 2.4/5 on Weight Loss | 2.4/5 on Healthy
Mediterranean The Mediterranean diet advocates heart-healthy foods that are typically eaten in the Mediterranean. The diet guides people to eat plenty of plants and foods that are low on "bad" cholesterol, such as legumes, nuts, wheat, fruits and veggies. For example, in this diet, you replace butter with healthy fats like olive oil, salt with herbs and spices, and red meat with fish and poultry. Plus, it totally encourages a glass of red wine every now and then. In essence, you're not avoiding fats and carbs, you're just choosing the healthier versions.
U.S. News & World Report: 3.0/5 on Weight loss | 4.9/5 on Healthy
A healthy diet doesn't require a complete life change. Instead, make smarter choices more often when shopping, cooking and eating.

Texto completo: LEWISTON — When his grandparents brought him to the United States from the Philippines as a child, Jose Antonio Vargas didn’t realize his life was supposed to be a quiet one, lived under the radar.
But after becoming a successful journalist, Vargas took the unusual and risky step of revealing his undocumented status in an essay for The New York Times Magazine in 2011. Then he made a documentary that not only told his story but explored the issue of children like him who were illegally brought to America.
That movie, “Documented,” will be shown at 6 p.m. Tuesday, Jan. 15, in Callahan Hall at the Lewiston Public Library. The screening is free and open to the public.
The screening, co-sponsored by the Lewiston Public Library and Youth Journalism International, will be followed by a discussion and refreshments.
“This compelling movie is about the life of one journalist who wants to tell the truth about himself, but it also addresses the widespread issue of young undocumented Americans,” said Jackie Majerus, executive director of Youth Journalism International, an educational nonprofit based in Lewiston-Auburn. “We’re excited to be working with the library and hope the community will come and hear this story for themselves.”
Vargas, who is still grappling with his undocumented status and hasn’t seen his mother since he left the Philippines at age 12, recently had a new book published on immigration, “Dear America, Notes of an Undocumented Citizen.”
Youth Journalism International works with student writers, artists and photographers worldwide. The organization teaches journalism, connects young people around the globe, fosters cross-cultural understanding and promotes and defends a free youth press.
For more information about the screening or Youth Journalism International, contact Jackie Majerus at jmajerus@youthjournalism.org or call 207-241-2607.

Do Democrats have magic number?

Texto completo: As the new year turns and Democrats focus on candidates to oppose President Donald Trump in 2020, there’s one number they should keep in mind: 47. Here’s why. Since the end of World War II, Democrats have elected only four presidents who did not hold the office already: John F. Kennedy in 1960, Jimmy Carter in 1976, Bill Clinton in 1992 and Barack Obama in 2008.
Those four successful Democrats share many traits, but one of the most striking is their age on the day they were elected. They range from Kennedy, 43, to Carter, 52, but their average was — yes — 47. In fact, that was Obama’s exact age when he defeated 72-year-old John McCain. Of course, age is a very rough metric, but looking at the emerging field of Democratic aspirants, one impression is unmistakable. The potential candidate who best fits the profile of Democratic winners is Beto O’Rourke, the three-time congressman from El Paso, Texas, who narrowly lost a Senate race in November. On Election Day 2020, he will be 48.
A closer look at the four victorious post-war Democrats shows that their age was really a symbol for a much larger issue. Their youth helped shape their narratives, the stories they told voters about their past experiences and their plans for the future. Kennedy spearheaded the wave of returning World War II veterans who entered politics and assumed the leadership of the country. Carter was not a harbinger of a new generation, but as a naval officer-turned-peanut farmer, and then as a governor who had never served in the capitol, he represented a clean break from the "swamp" of post-Watergate Washington. Clinton was the first baby boomer president who talked about "building a bridge to the 21st century" and played on the name of his hometown in Arkansas when he told the Democratic convention in 1992, "I still believe in a place called Hope." Thirteen years before he was elected president, Barack Obama published a best-selling memoir, "Dreams From My Father," which told a new version of an old American story: a biracial child overcoming adversity and achieving success through his own merit and motivation.
Obama has met with O’Rourke since the election, and in an interview with his close adviser David Axelrod, the former president praised the defeated congressman as an "impressive young man who ran a terrific race in Texas."
Obama even drew parallels between himself and O’Rourke. He won in 2008, Obama told Axelrod, because "people had a sense that I said what I meant," and he discerned the same attempt to level with voters in the Texan’s failed campaign: "What I liked most about his race was that it didn’t feel constantly poll-tested."
Two New York Times political writers see another parallel between the two men. "Like Mr. Obama as he entered the 2008 campaign," wrote Matt Flegenheimer and Jonathan Martin, "Mr. O’Rourke can be difficult to place on an ideological spectrum, allowing supporters to project their own politics onto a messaging palette of national unity and common ground."
This is all very premature. O’Rourke might not even run for president. But if he does, remember the magic number is 47.

Texto completo: As the new year turns and Democrats focus on candidates to oppose President Donald Trump in 2020, there’s one number they should keep in mind: 47.
Here’s why. Since the end of World War II, Democrats have elected only four presidents who did not hold the office already: John F. Kennedy in 1960, Jimmy Carter in 1976, Bill Clinton in 1992 and Barack Obama in 2008.
Those four successful Democrats share many traits, but one of the most striking is their age on the day they were elected. They range from Kennedy, 43, to Carter, 52, but their average was — yes — 47. In fact, that was Obama’s exact age when he defeated 72-year-old John McCain.
Of course, age is a very rough metric, but looking at the emerging field of Democratic aspirants, one impression is unmistakable. The potential candidate who best fits the profile of Democratic winners is Beto O’Rourke, the three-time congressman from El Paso, Texas, who narrowly lost a Senate race in November. On Election Day 2020, he will be 48.
It’s still 14 months before the Iowa caucuses, so polls are minimally instructive. But it’s worth noting that the first survey of potential caucusgoers put O’Rourke in third place behind two much better-known (and much older) possibilities: former vice president Joe Biden, who will be almost 78 in November 2020, and Sen. Bernie Sanders, who will be 79. Fourth-place Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who has announced an official exploratory committee, will be 71.
A closer look at the four victorious post-war Democrats shows that their age was really a symbol for a much larger issue. Their youth helped shape their narratives, the stories they told voters about their past experiences and their plans for the future. In all four cases, those future presidents captured something profoundly important about America, about our eternal search for something new and fresh and different. They embodied perhaps the best slogan in our entire political history: "It’s Time for a Change!" (So did Trump, even though he was 70 in 2016.) Kennedy spearheaded the wave of returning World War II veterans who entered politics and assumed the leadership of the country. The words in his inaugural address — "A torch has been passed to a new generation of Americans" — stand as the quintessential expression of the nation’s embrace of youthful energy and optimism.
Carter was not a harbinger of a new generation, but as a naval officer-turned-peanut farmer, and then as a governor who had never served in the capitol, he represented a clean break from the "swamp" of post-Watergate Washington. His brilliant slogan — "I will never lie to you" — echoed Kennedy’s promise of a new national beginning, a clean start.
Clinton was the first baby boomer president who talked about "building a bridge to the 21st century" and played on the name of his hometown in Arkansas when he told the Democratic convention in 1992, "I still believe in a place called Hope." He reflected the bright line of optimism that connects successful candidates when he picked a campaign theme song with the insistent refrain, "Don’t Stop Thinking About Tomorrow."
Thirteen years before he was elected president, Barack Obama published a best-selling memoir, "Dreams From My Father," which told a new version of an old American story: a biracial child overcoming adversity and achieving success through his own merit and motivation. The book foreshadowed his timeless campaign theme of "Hope and Change," two of the most resonant words in the American political lexicon.
Obama has met with O’Rourke since the election, and in an interview with his close adviser David Axelrod, the former president praised the defeated congressman as an "impressive young man who ran a terrific race in Texas."
Obama even drew parallels between himself and O’Rourke. He won in 2008, Obama told Axelrod, because "people had a sense that I said what I meant," and he discerned the same attempt to level with voters in the Texan’s failed campaign: "What I liked most about his race was that it didn’t feel constantly poll-tested."

"Like Mr. Obama as he entered the 2008 campaign," wrote Matt Flegenheimer and Jonathan Martin, "Mr. O’Rourke can be difficult to place on an ideological spectrum, allowing supporters to project their own politics onto a messaging palette of national unity and common ground."
This is all very premature. O’Rourke might not even run for president. But if he does, remember the magic number is 47.

Texto completo: The graphic novel "Showtime at the Apollo: The Epic Tale of Harlem's Legendary Theater" is like a sprawling Hollywood biopic. A sea of boldface names -- James Brown, the Jackson Five, Dionne Warwick and countless others -- make their way through the theater.
The work, adapted by Ted Fox from his 1983 history of the same name, and illustrated by James Otis Smith, goes beyond the singers, dancers, comedians and other entertainers who have taken the stage of the Apollo, which celebrates its 85th anniversary this month. The book also shines a light on Harlem and black culture in America.
Fox said he reworked his Apollo history into a focused narrative told in three acts, beginning years before the first performance at the theater. An early chapter highlights the Harlem Renaissance and some nightspots, like the Cotton Club, where black performers were popular, yet where black audience members were usually barred. It also notes that the Apollo name first turns up in 1922 -- when it was the name of a burlesque theater.
An early page of "Showtime at the Apollo" -- published by Abrams ComicArts and arriving in stores on Jan. 8 -- states simply, "It is an epic tale." An illustrated prologue, "A Quest," shows the author in March 1980, when he meets Bobby Schiffman, the son of Frank Schiffman (a founder of the Apollo). The younger Schiffman, who temporarily shuttered the theater in 1976, agrees to cooperate with Fox on the book on one condition: "Write about the way the Apollo really was, the good and bad."
The graphic novel juggles the sometimes harsh realities of the outside world and the magic of the performances on stage. There is drug abuse, robberies and riots -- but the overall outlook remains upbeat. Like a biopic, the second act is filled with highs and lows. On Jan. 26, 1934, Hurtig and Seamon's Burlesque is reopened as the Apollo Theater, whose inaugural show, "Jazz à la Carte," is what the 85th anniversary this year commemorates.
In 1935, there is rioting and looting in the neighborhood, following accusations that two white clerks at a local store, S.H. Kress & Co., beat a young black shopper. (About 3,000 people descended upon S.H. Kress, according to a report in The New York Times.) During the unrest, the Apollo is spared from any physical destruction, as it will be time and again.
In 1943, Harlem experiences a worse riot when a police officer shoots and arrests a black soldier. A rumor of his death spreads and many white-owned businesses in Harlem are gutted, but there is an exception: "Nobody touches the Apollo," the graphic novel reads. "A cordon of Harlemites forms spontaneously to protect the theater." The book makes note of other riots in the '60s and a shooting in the theater, in 1975, during a performance by Smokey Robinson.
These sobering moments balance the euphoria of other events, like the live recording of a 1963 album by James Brown, which stays on the charts for 66 weeks; or a 1980 performance by George Clinton, who opts for the Harlem stage over Madison Square Garden, a scene whose panels are filled with the refrain "One nation under groove" and "It's Saturday Night at the Apollo."
One historic moment that comes to life is a performance by the bandleader Lionel Hampton. A caption reads, "Hampton has a penchant for clearing the Apollo, even if it means leading the audience out with his own band!" On two sequential pages, Smith illustrates the band playing, the puff of smoke that allows Hampton to disappear from the stage, the rapturous audience and a march down West 125th Street to the cheers of those outside.
The Apollo artwork is filled with characters whose faces are known worldwide, in a palette of black, white and multiple blues. "I find color in comics -- especially modern digital coloring -- to be distracting," Smith wrote in an email. "I love the somewhat anonymous commercial illustration of the '40s and '50s, and the physical limitations of print techniques. I tried to use the blue mainly as a graphic element."
Smith credits Pete Friedrich, an art director, for a lot of the design work, which includes smartly placed newspaper clippings that move the story along.
The story notes that performing at the theater was physically demanding: During its heyday, an engagement meant a weeklong commitment of 31 shows.
Benny Payne, who played piano for Cab Calloway, describes challenging logistics: playing two shows at the Apollo and two at the downtown Paramount theater on the same day, leading to frantic cab rides with back-seat outfit changes. Despite the unrelenting artistic demands of the space, it would be financial issues that brought the theater down: In late 1979, the I.R.S. closed the Apollo for payroll-tax violations.
But the third act delivers the start of a happy ending: The Apollo gets taken over by new management in 1981, begins renovations in May 1983 and, one month later, is designated a New York City landmark. Financial mismanagement strikes again; The Daily News earns a Pulitzer Prize for editorial writing in 1999 for its coverage of the plight of the theater. Order is restored, followed by an outdoor renovation that is unveiled in 2005, with the theater's marquee made to look as much as possible as the original -- though this time with a multitude of lights.
The final dialogue in the graphic novel belongs to Francis Thomas -- a.k.a. Doll, or Mr. Apollo -- who was a veteran of the Harlem entertainment scene. He was the theater's manager, technician, and, ultimately, its caretaker, and he lived in an apartment in the theater. Thomas pulls back a metamorphic curtain on the Wednesday amateur nights, which began in the 1930s and continue today. "It's Harlem's high spot," he says. "The Apollo will always be that."

Texto completo: The new year is only two days old. But for Apple, it's possible that 2019 could end up being one of its longest years in recent history, with ominous portents for the rest of the tech industry.
On Wednesday, the Cupertino tech titan cut its revenue forecast for its just-completed fiscal first quarter. It was a nearly unheard-of move for a company whose profits in recent years have been the envy of the world.
In a letter to shareholders posted on the company's investor relations site, Apple CEO Tim Cook said the company expects sales for the quarter that ended Dec. 29 to come in at $84 billion, compared with an earlier outlook for sales in a range of $89 billion to $93 billion and he pointed to the uncertain Chinese market as the culprit.
"While we anticipated some challenges in key emerging markets, we did not foresee the magnitude of the economic deceleration, particularly in greater China," Cook said in a letter to investors. "We believe the economic environment in China has been further impacted by rising trade tensions with the United States."
Apple's surprise announcement is almost certain to reverberate in the broader tech industry, adding to concerns about the ability of American companies to navigate an increasingly uncertain economy amid the Trump administration's aggressive stance on trade with China and other nations.
For Apple, the impact of the trade war quickly became palpable: Not only will the company's sales end up being below its prior outlook, its revenue also is expected to fall almost 5 percent from the $88.3 billion it reported in last year's fiscal first quarter.
"Lower than anticipated iPhone revenue, primarily in greater China, accounts for all of our revenue shortfall to our guidance and for much more than our entire year-over-year revenue decline," Cook said in his shareholder letter.
The new forecast was all Wall Street needed to turn on Apple, as investors drove the company's shares down by more than 7 percent, to $146.10, in after-hours trading. Along with Wednesday's after-market losses, Apple shares have fallen by more than 15 percent over the past year.
Tim Bajarin, president of tech consultancy Creative Strategies, said that what Apple is seeing is a reflection of the state of the world economy and a maturing market for what has for years been a hot consumer product.
"China's worsening economy was bound to impact Apple and most of the smartphone companies as demand for smartphones (was) down across the board," he said. "Smartphone demand around the world has reached a peak, and it will be harder and harder for all smartphone companies to adjust to this new normal and create products that will still gain serious consumer demand."
Apple has a history of giving quarterly revenue outlooks that are slightly less than analysts' forecasts, then exceeding those estimates with its quarterly results.
But cutting a sales outlook for a business period that has just ended, and ahead of its upcoming quarterly results, is something completely foreign to Apple since before the iPod took off and set Apple on the path to where, in August, it became the first American company to reach a market valuation of $1 trillion.
"This will be the most defining moment in Cook's career," said Dan Ives, director of technology research at Wedbush Securities. "This was a major black eye for Apple as the China growth story crumbled this quarter, and it seems Cook and company were caught flat-footed."
Comments from Cook were likely to add to speculation that Apple's latest batch of new iPhones the iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max and iPhone XR are meeting with less-than-spectacular sales. The iPhone XS Max, for instance, starts at $1,099, while the iPhone XS has an initial price tag of $999. The iPhone XR starts out as a relatively inexpensive $749.
"In some developed markets, iPhone upgrades also were not as strong as we thought they would be," Cook said.
In November, Apple made investors nervous about iPhone sales, in particular, when the company said that it would no longer give quarterly unit-sales figures for iPhones, as well as iPads and Mac computers.
As part of an effort to spur iPhone sales, the company is currently running a promotion in which iPhone owners can trade in their current phones and get an iPhone XR starting at $449, or an iPhone XS from $699.

Texto completo: ALBANY – Former Vice President Joseph Biden has the "best case" for the Democratic nomination for president in 2020, according to New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo.
Cuomo, a Democrat, offered an endorsement Wednesday of a potential Biden presidential campaign, arguing that the Delaware Democrat has "credibility" with the American public.
The governor, who has denied interest in running in 2020 himself, made the comment after he was asked about Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren's presidential prospects.
"My two cents? I think of all the names that are out there, I think Joe Biden has the best case," Cuomo said on WAMC-FM (90.3) in Albany. "I think Joe Biden has the best case because he brings the most of the secret ingredient you need to win, which is credibility."
Cuomo was asked whether he might want to be Biden's running mate, but demurred.
"I am not even focusing on any of that," Cuomo said. "What I'm doing is what I believe I need to do for this state."
Longtime allies Cuomo has long counted Biden as a powerful ally.
Biden delivered a speech endorsing Cuomo for re-election at the state Democratic Convention in May, praising him for pushing big infrastructure projects and emphasizing the need to get things done.
Prior to that, Biden has made trips to New York to hail Cuomo for increasing the minimum wage and mark the groundbreaking on improvements at LaGuardia Airport.
Cuomo, who was inaugurated for a third term Tuesday night, has repeatedly denied he will run for president himself, saying in an August debate that he would serve a full four-year term "unless God strikes me dead."
Gillibrand to run? Another New Yorker, U.S. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of Brunswick, has said she's exploring a bid for the Democratic nomination in 2020.
The New York Times reported last week that Gillibrand has been weighing potential campaign managers and a location for a headquarters, likely to be in upstate New York.
On Wednesday, Cuomo said the potentially huge field of Democratic presidential candidates should work on highlighting the positives of their work.
"I think the main issue for the Democrats is not going to be the articulation of the negative," Cuomo said. "It's going to be the articulation of the positive and the credibility of the positive."
The governor said Biden was best suited to do that.
"You don't hire an airline pilot who has never flown a plane," Cuomo said. "Where is the credibility in your argument? Joe Biden can say, 'I was there. I was not the president, but I was the second seat.'"

Harry Reid: Trump is 'the worst president we've ever had'

Texto completo: Former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid says President Trump is the “worst president” the U.S. has ever had.

“I think he is without question the worst president we’ve ever had. We’ve had some bad ones, and there’s not even a close second to him,” Reid, who is battling pancreatic cancer, told the New York Times. “He’ll lie. He’ll cheat. You can’t reason with him.”

Reid added the he felt Trump was not “immoral” but was “amoral.”

“Amoral is when you shoot someone in the head, it doesn’t make a difference. No conscience,” Reid said.

Reid said Congress can't legislate properly when there is such a “weird” president in office.

“You can’t legislate when you have a chief executive who’s weird, for lack of a better description,” Reid said, adding that if he were working for Trump he wouldn’t be able to look his children in their eyes.

Reid said that although he does not speak to his successor Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., he often talks to Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.

"I talk to Nancy often. I love Nancy Pelosi,” Reid said.

He also defended his decision to end the Senate filibuster for most judicial nominees in 2013, a move that has allowed the GOP Senate to easily approve many of Trump's judges.

“We had over 100 judges that we couldn’t get approved, so I had no choice," Reid said. "Either Obama’s presidency would be a joke or Obama’s presidency would be one of fruition."

Resumen: During his comeback sets in Boston, Davidson claimed that Louis C.K. had attempted to get him fired from "Saturday Night Live" over his marijuana use.

Texto completo: Weeks after a December Instagram post in which he said he didn't "want to be on this earth anymore," Pete Davidson laughed his way into 2019 – and took aim at fellow comedian Louis C. K.
In addition to sharing his thoughts on being name-dropped in a song by ex-fiancée Ariana Grande, the 25-year-old comedian had a few choice words for C. K. , whom he accused of trying to get him fired from "Saturday Night Live. "
The revelation, which was reported by Newsweek and Us Weekly, sprang out of a joke in which Davidson wondered if his choice of tattoos was a causal factor in a couple of celebrity deaths.
"I got a Harry Potter tattoo," he told the audience during "Pete Davidson & Friends" show in Boston. "Then the next day, Alan Rickman, the guy who played Snape, died, and I was like, 'Oh, what a weird coincidence,' " Davidson joked, according to E!
He continued, "Then I got a Willy Wonka tattoo. Next day, Gene Wilder dies. Now I'm like, all right, that's a coincidence, that's weird. So I'm thinking of getting a tattoo of Louis C. K. , what do you guys think?"
C. K. , who admitted to sexual misconduct last year, had again been criticized for mocking students who survived last year's mass shooting in Parkland, Florida during his latest comeback set.
Davidson said that the last time C. K. hosted "SNL" in April 2017, the "Louie" star "told all the producers in front of me that 'all this kid does is smoke weed and he's gonna smoke his career away. '"
The "SNL" star, who has said he uses marijuana to cope with chronic pain brought on by Crohn's Disease, claimed C. K. told executive producer Lorne Michaels, "Pete smokes so much weed that it makes people uncomfortable. "
It was the first stand-up set since the comedian worried colleagues and fans with a December Instagram post in which he said he didn't "want to be on this earth anymore. "
During his two cathartic performances, Davidson also revealed that he cried to his mother following his broken engagement to Grande and shared his thoughts on her breakup anthem, "Thank U, Next. "
"Usually, breakup songs you know who it's about but you don't really know," Davidson said, according to E! News and The New York Times. "Bam. She named all of us. "
Davidson recalled the song (in which Grande sings: "Even almost got married / And for Pete, I'm so thankful") was released right before "SNL" aired, describing it as a "sad day. "
"That (expletive) came out before I had to put on a (expletive) duck hat and be like, 'derrrp here's the pizza!' So all my friends were there. …We didn't know it was going to happen," he said, according to E!

The comedian split with Grande in October after a whirlwind romance, which was the fodder for at least two "Weekend Update" segments this fall, including an appearance with wounded Navy SEAL-turned-Congressman-elect Dan Crenshaw, whom he had compared to a "hitman in a porno movie. "
He had kept a low profile during the final episode of "SNL" of 2018, where he was not seen aside from introducing musical guests Miley Cyrus and Mark Ronson. That was the same night he deleted his Instagram account.
On Dec. 23, Davidson was spotted above the stage at friend Machine Gun Kelly's concert in Cleveland.

Texto completo: MOSCOW — The American whom Russians have arrested and declared a spy is a Marine Corps veteran who was in Moscow to attend a wedding, his family said on Tuesday.
Russia's Federal Security Service said on Monday that the American, Paul N. Whelan, had been detained on Friday “during an act of espionage," and that a criminal case had been opened against him.
Conviction on a spying charge in Russia carries a prison sentence of up to 20 years.
“We noticed that he was not in communication," his parents and siblings said in a statement, “which was very much out of character for him even when he was traveling."
Whelan's twin brother, David, said Paul was in Moscow for a wedding of a fellow Marine, which took place at an upscale hotel in central Moscow on Dec. 28, the day he was detained.
"It is inconceivable to me that he would have done anything to break the law in Russia," David Whelan told The Washington Post.
A member of the US government should have visited Whelan in detention by now, according to Russia's obligations under the Vienna Convention, which dictates that consular access must be provided within a 72-hour window from the time of arrest.
But the government shutdown may have hindered this process, said a person familiar with Whelan's case, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the case.
Although US embassies are not closed during the shutdown, they are working with reduced staff. The person added that it could take months before the case is resolved.
A press officer for the State Department said by e-mail the department had been notified of the arrest by Russia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
"We are deeply concerned for his safety and well-being," his family said in a statement. "His innocence is undoubted and we trust that his rights will be respected."
David Whelan described his brother as a “kind soul" who was generous and “often has stories that make you eye-roll."
Paul Whelan works as the corporate security director for BorgWarner, an automotive parts supplier based in Auburn Hills, Mich., that has business contracts in Russia. "BorgWarner has been in contact with the relevant US government authorities in order to help our employee and the US government," the company said in a statement.
Whelan is a regular visitor to Russia.
According to Whelan's brother and Russian acquaintances reached by the Post, he has been visiting Russia since 2007.
He enlisted in the Marines in 1994 and rose through the ranks to become a staff sergeant, serving two tours in Iraq, in 2004 and 2006, according to military records released to the Post.
Whelan was discharged for bad conduct in 2008 after being convicted of several charges related to larceny, according to the records.
Several Russian acquaintances described Whelan as a friendly man who greatly appreciated Russia and had a basic command of the language.
An acquaintance in St. Petersburg said the pair had made plans to meet in that city around Jan. 1, but contact with the American abruptly stopped on the day of his arrest.
Whelan's arrest comes as tensions between Washington and Moscow continue to escalate over issues including election interference, the crises in Syria and Ukraine, and the poisoning of a former Russian spy in Britain.
Russian officials have denied any involvement in such efforts.
The timing of Whelan's arrest — coming weeks after Russian gun rights activist Maria Butina pleaded guilty to Kremlin interference in the United States — has raised questions about a potential swap. The two countries do not have an extradition treaty.

__________
Trading on confidential information remains hard to resist despite a decade of criminal enforcement and prison terms for those who get caught and prosecuted.
And as long as that is the case, insider trading will remain a focus for the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission. Four cases in December show that reality.
William T. Walters, one of America's most famous gamblers, had his convictions for insider trading affirmed on Dec. 4 by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in Manhattan. He is serving a five-year prison term for trading shares of Dean Foods based on information he received from the former chairman of the company's board, Thomas Davis.
His case was less about insider trading law and more about whether the investigation was tainted by what Mr. Walters's lawyer labeled "extraordinary government misconduct." The government admitted before trial that David Chaves, an F.B.I. special agent, leaked information about the investigation to reporters at The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times. The defense argued that Mr. Chaves made the disclosures to revive a dormant investigation, which led to Mr. Davis's cooperation with the government and testimony against Mr. Walters.
The appeals court called the agent's conduct "highly improper" and said that the leaks "violated the grand jury secrecy provision" of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6(e). Still, the court found that the leaks did not taint Mr. Walters's conviction because the grand jury's decision to indict was not influenced by the news media reports. Thus, the convictions stand despite the misconduct of Mr. Chaves.
In a second criminal insider trading case, prosecutors asked the Federal District Court in Manhattan on Dec. 4 to schedule a retrial of Sean Stewart, a former investment banker whose convictions were overturned in November. The appeals court found that the trial judge improperly excluded evidence that could be used to undermine a statement made by Mr. Stewart's father that was the linchpin of the government's case that Mr. Stewart improperly tipped his father to the impending deals.
Mr. Stewart's father said his son once berated him for not trading on information that he provided on a "silver platter." Although the statement is problematic, the defense will have a better opportunity at the retrial to show the father might have just made it up. After his arrest, the father told agents that his son did not know about the trading or tipping of confidential information.
In insider trading prosecutions, it is up to the jury to decide whom to believe when a defendant denies having any improper motive. The problem for a defendant like Mr. Stewart is that the widely held perception that Wall Street bankers trade on inside information is difficult to overcome.
Also in December, the Federal District Court in Atlanta rejected an effort by Jun Ying, the former chief information officer at Equifax, to dismiss insider trading charges. Mr. Ying exercised all of his vested stock options and sold nearly $1 million in shares a little more than a week before the company disclosed the hack of its database in September 2017, according to the S.E.C. He argued that the government had not shown that he had "used" confidential information about the hack when he sold the shares.
The question of how the government can show a defendant used inside information, even if it can prove the person knew it, can be difficult. In this case, prosecutors are relying on internet searches Mr. Ying conducted into the effect of hacks on other credit reporting companies, like Experian, and the timing of the trades to show that he must have based the trading decision on the inside information he gathered about the hacking at Equifax and not a more benign reason. By selling the shares when he did, the defendant gained $480,000. That's something a jury is likely to view suspiciously. The stock dropped over 15 percent after news of the data breach was made public.
The government often portrays insider trading as motivated by greed, and the opportunity to make money can prove irresistible when the only real victim of the violation is the faceless securities market.
The lure of easy profits is apparent in civil charges filed by the S.E.C. against Rajeshwar R. Gannamaneni and his wife and father for trading ahead of 40 deals over four years. Mr. Gannamaneni was an information technology contractor for an investment bank in Singapore, and the three defendants are accused of making almost $600,000 from their trading.
Hiding insider trading can be difficult if a person makes outsize profits, which will quickly draw the attention of the stock and options exchanges. But if one can keep the trading profits small, there is a chance that it might fly under the radar, at least for a time. The problem with this approach is that making a little bit of money is not nearly as satisfying as making a lot, so greed starts to take over.
The charges against Mr. Gannamaneni and the other two defendants show that they started small, usually making a profit of less than $10,000, and once only $78. But by 2015 and 2016, their profit on trades was as high as $55,000. That is sure to draw the interest of the S.E.C.'s market surveillance office, which looks for patterns of successful trading.
The lesson from Mr. Gannamaneni's case is that confidential information exerts a powerful pull to make more and more easy money, which means that one is much more likely to get caught. So if you think the government will not notice your well-timed trades, increasing your profit means there is a much higher chance that you will be discovered.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Trump backtracks on order for 30-day exit from Syria

Texto completo: President Trump has agreed to give the military about four months to withdraw the 2,000 US troops in Syria, administration officials said Monday, backtracking from his abrupt order two weeks ago that the military pull out within 30 days.
Trump confirmed on Twitter that troops would “slowly" be withdrawn, but complained that he got little credit for the move after a fresh round of criticism from retired general Stanley A. McChrystal and revelations from the departing White House chief of staff, John Kelly, himself a retired Marine general, about the president's impulsive decision-making.
“If anybody but Donald Trump did what I did in Syria, which was an ISIS loaded mess when I became President, they would be a national hero," Trump wrote.
For a president who has looked to the military for affirmation throughout his campaign and presidency and boasted about stocking his Cabinet with what he called “my generals," his decision Dec. 19 to withdraw quickly from Syria was a significant split from his military and civilians advisers. The criticism from McChrystal, who commanded US-led troops in Afghanistan from 2009 to 2010, echoed longstanding denunciations by former senior intelligence officials, who have warned that Trump's approach to national security is reckless.
A Pentagon spokesman, Commander Sean Robertson, said Monday, “I'll let the president's words speak for themselves."

Trump nominee Barr once questioned value of wall
President Trump's pick for attorney general, William Barr, once questioned the value of a wall along the Mexican border similar to the one the president has advocated, describing the idea as "overkill."
Barr was attorney general under President George H.W. Bush when he was asked in a Feb. 24, 1992, interview whether he supported a proposal from Republican presidential challenger Pat Buchanan to erect a barrier of ditches and fences along the border to stop illegal immigration.
"I don't think it's necessary. I think that's overkill to put a barrier from one side of the border to the other," Barr replied on "The MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour" on PBS. "In fact, the problem with illegal immigration across the border is really confined to major metropolitan areas. Illegal immigrants do not cross in the middle of the desert and walk hundreds of miles," instead choosing more "certain specified routes."
Those routes through more populated areas have since largely been closed off, pushing migrants to riskier desert routes. Other public statements by Barr from his tenure as attorney general and within the last year suggest a hardened immigration approach more in line with the broader security measures Trump and his advisers have discussed.
A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment on whether Barr's views on a wall have changed.
Barr's past comments on the effectiveness of a wall reflect a nuance often missing from Trump's rhetoric, who made the construction of a "big beautiful wall" of concrete and steel a centerpiece of his campaign.
Trump's ambition for a wall has given way to a more modest reality, with him now describing the barrier as "artistically designed steel slats."
His former chief of staff, John Kelly, told The Los Angeles Times in an interview published Sunday that Trump had abandoned the notion of "a solid concrete wall early on in the administration."
Trump seemed to respond to Kelly with a tweet Monday morning, saying "an all concrete Wall was NEVER ABANDONED."
Whatever the terminology, border security remains the central sticking point in the partial government shutdown. Trump is seeking $5 billion for a wall.

Alvin Ailey dancer displays his passionate humility

Texto completo: A dancer isn't always born a dancer. Sometimes a mother has to step in.
Growing up on the South Side of Chicago with his single working mother, Solomon Dumas was involved in community theater and interested in the arts. But dance wasn't much of a presence in his life until his mother signed him up for AileyCamp, when he was 12.
"She made me go," Dumas said. "My mother kept me busy. There wasn't a lot of idle time. She kept me in programs."
AileyCamp turned out to be a good choice.
"After that camp, I was completely obsessed," he said. "We learned discipline through dance and we started each day with affirmations. I remember receiving a souvenir program book, and I had never seen so many beautiful people in my life. I said, Oh my gosh, they look like me. Or I want to look like them. There was this elegance, this sophistication. And that was something that I needed to see at that time."
Dumas, nearing his third year in Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, is the only member to have started as an Ailey camper and gone on to join the main company. (AileyCamps - there were 10 in 2018 - are summer day camps for ages 11-14.) "I didn't realize I forced him," his mother, Beverly Rogers, said laughing. "It was just he went wherever I said to go. He never complained. He may have grunted a little bit, but I didn't pay that any attention."
Rogers can't say that she knew he was a dancer or an actor as a child, but recalled that before he could walk, whenever he heard music, he would bounce.
At 30, Dumas seems to have retained some of that bounce. Even when seated for an interview in the lounge at New York City Center - where the Ailey company's season continues through Sunday - his body was full of vibrations that extended to slender fingers drumming rhythms on a table or gesticulating into the air. It's an energy that has radiated from the stage this season, a spectacular one for Dumas, who danced leading parts in new works by Ronald K. Brown ("The Call") and Rennie Harris ("Lazarus").
Created as part of the company's 60th anniversary, and each in its way an homage to Ailey, they are two of the most important and affecting dances of the year - not just at the Ailey company, but period. They're meaningful, even masterly additions to the repertory, giving the company something to sink its physical and emotional weight into. That came through in the dancing, which was full of reverence and urgency.
In both premieres, Dumas showed his range, his unforced strength and his quiet, simmering power. He isn't flashy; his grounded presence is what makes him so beguiling.
Robert Battle, the company's artistic director, said he had been especially moved by Dumas this season. "I almost didn't recognize him in a good way," Battle said. "He's kind of a chameleon."
The circumstances under which Dumas performed the lead in "The Call" were stressful. The morning of its premiere was just an ordinary day - hectic, but ordinary - when he noticed that Masazumi Chaya, the group's associate artistic director, was watching company class. That was odd enough, but stranger still was that Chaya was watching him.
It turned out that Jamar Roberts, scheduled to dance the lead, was injured, and Brown, the choreographer, wanted Dumas to take over. Dumas was panicked. He didn't know the steps; his focus had been on his part in the dance's trio.
"I had to basically learn it within an hour," Dumas said. "I was like, 'I'm not ready, I'm not ready.'" But Brown pulled him aside. "When he asked me, I couldn't say no," said Dumas, who used to be a member of Brown's company. "You don't say no to Ron."
The two first worked together when Dumas was a student at the Ailey school. After Dumas completed two years with Ailey II, the company's junior division, he joined Brown's troupe. "I just waited my turn," Brown said.
Dumas knows about waiting his turn: His path to the main company hasn't been a direct one. After his AileyCamp experience, he attended the Chicago Academy for the Arts as well as the Russell Talbert Dance Studio, where he continued his training after school. There, his focus was ballet. "I was in the studio until about 9 p.m. every day, even sometimes on Sundays."
Before he trained at the Ailey school, he was briefly a member of Garth Fagan Dance. After leaving Brown's company, he was weighing his options: He was an instructor at Barry's Bootcamp, and had started acting classes. But there was an Ailey audition and he decided to go. It was his fifth try, and there was only one male spot open.
"I always thought if I got into the company it would be during this mass exodus when there were maybe four spots," he said. "I never thought that I would be the one guy. Because I wasn't the tall guy. I wasn't the leggy guy. I was never that dancer known for the tricks and the things you would associate Ailey with."
Yet for Brown, he has a kind of passionate humility. "He goes for broke, but not like he's trying to impress you - and not like he even knows," he said. "He takes over the stage and is still kind of unassuming. He doesn't dance small and he doesn't apologize when he's dancing. It's like butter and fire at the same time."
This season, Dumas said he was grateful to spend so much time in the studio with choreographers like Brown, Harris and Twyla Tharp, who worked with him closely on "The Golden Section" (1981). The day she arrived was a memorable one. "I open the piece and as soon as I went across the floor, she stopped the music," he said. "I said, Oh God, this is the most embarrassing thing. She came to me and said: 'Look at me. You're holding back.'"
He started over; she stopped the music again and told him again, more firmly, that he was holding back. "And then I did it" - he snapped his fingers - "I don't know what clicked in. She said, 'That's what I'm talking about.' She kind of broke me down."
Tharp worked with the company for a week and spent so much time with Dumas that Battle said he wondered, "Is she going to take him and leave with him?" She taught him about daring: The difference between simply performing a role and dancing like you're not afraid to fall down.
But while Dumas is enjoying such challenges, he said he's not one of those dancers who plans to stay in the company for 20 years. "Hell, no," he said, laughing. But "only because there are so many other things that I want to do dance-wise - and everything else."
At the same time, he knows that, well, you never know. He said he was shocked when Battle hired him.
"I did have an emotional moment because I thought back to being an Ailey camper," he said of learning the news in Battle's office. "I still have his handkerchief. He told me that he liked my dancing and that he had no idea that I was coming. There were no preconceived ideas or notions - I wasn't on the radar. I just came in and he said, 'Wow - OK, I'll go with him.' I'm so glad he took the chance."

Texto completo: DHAKA, Bangladesh -- Bangladesh's governing party won handily in Sunday's parliamentary elections, clinching a third consecutive term for Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina even as widespread reports of irregularities, voter intimidation and violence cast the voting into question.
Mrs. Hasina's party, the Awami League, and its allies officially won 288 of the 298 parliamentary seats that have been called by the Election Commission, with a total of 300 seats up for grabs.
But the opposition swiftly rejected the results, accusing the governing party of tampering with votes and calling for a fresh election. Mrs. Hasina, 71, is the first leader in Bangladesh's history to win three consecutive terms, but she has increasingly been accused of autocratic behavior.
The opposition leader Kamal Hossain denounced the "farcical election" on Sunday night as the results streamed in. The Election Commission said it was looking into reports of irregularities.
"News of vote robberies have come from almost all constituencies," Mr. Hossain told journalists Sunday night. "We reject the announced result of this election."
Reporters from the prominent Bangladeshi newspaper The Daily Star said they witnessed ballot stuffing and voter intimidation across the country.
At least 17 people died in election-related violence across the country, according to the police, though that was less than in previous voting. But if the opposition were to take to the streets, many fear that deadlier clashes would break out given Bangladesh's history of political violence.
In past elections, the Awami League and the largest opposition group, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, carried out brutal campaigns to suppress each others' voters. The country has vacillated between the two parties' rule since democracy was restored in 1991 when a series of military dictatorships came to an end.
Ahead of this election, local and international rights organizations accused the governing party of creating an intimidating atmosphere by arresting and harassing opposition candidates and preventing them from campaigning. A Human Rights Watch report this month described the pre-election atmosphere as "a climate of fear extending from prominent voices in society to ordinary citizens."
Mrs. Hasina brushed off those accusations ahead of the polls. And the Awami League praised the election when polling stations closed on Sunday.
"This election has proved that a free, fair and neutral election is possible under a partisan government," said H.T. Imam, an adviser to Mrs. Hasina.
Mrs. Hasina has been credited with fostering economic and social development that has lifted Bangladesh from one of the poorest and least developed countries in the world to one that outperforms neighbors like India and Pakistan in some development measures, including gender equality and economic growth.
During nearly 10 years of Mr. Hasina's governance, per capita income has increased by nearly 150 percent, while the share of the population living in extreme poverty has shrunk to about 9 percent from 19 percent, according to the World Bank.
But under Mrs. Hasina, the government has also become increasingly heavy-handed about dissent. The police have continued to arrest critics without warrants and have detained citizens who disparage her government in Facebook posts or in media interviews.
Allies of Mrs. Hasina, including the opposition leader Mr. Hossain, split with the premier to oppose her in the election, denouncing what they described as her authoritarian tendencies that they warned would harden should she win a third term.
The opposition pitted the polls as Bangladesh's last chance to salvage democracy, claiming that the governing party was sacrificing citizens' personal freedoms and liberties in exchange for economic growth. Although the Bangladesh Nationalist Party had a poor human rights track record when in power, they vowed that they would change their ways, and made delivering good governance a centerpiece of their campaign.
At the very least, democracy advocates critical of both the Bangladesh Nationalist Party and the Awami League had hoped that the opposition would perform better in Sunday's elections to provide a strong check to Mrs. Hasina's third term. But the opposition only managed to win seven seats in parliament.
The prime minister rejected her critics in an interview in December with The New York Times, claiming that only urban elites were concerned about the right to criticize her government freely or assemble for protests. She went on to say that the opposition was pursuing an anti-government agenda and inciting violence.
"If I can provide food, jobs and health care, that is human rights," Mrs. Hasina said. "I know my country, and I know how to develop my country. My biggest challenge is that no one is left behind."

Is 'Holmes &amp; Watson' So Bad It's Actually Good?

Texto completo: The opening of "Holmes & Watson," the new comedy starring Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly, involves a boy kissing a donkey's rear end.
Believe it or not, the movie, directed by Etan Cohen, then goes even more lowbrow. Its script is replete with masturbation jokes, a lengthy vomit scene and a bizarrely sensual chess match.
So the critical rejection of this film, which reimagines Sherlock Holmes (Ferrell) and his compadre, Dr. Watson (Reilly), from the Sir Arthur Conan Doyle books, as dundering fools, might have been expected. (It didn't have advance screenings for critics, which is usually Hollywood code for "This isn't one of our finest.")
The initial reviews were not kind. Neither were subsequent ones. As of Sunday, Rotten Tomatoes rated it at 9 percent fresh, up from 0 percent from the initial batch. Reviewing the film for The New York Times, Ben Kenigsberg wrote that "smuggling in booze to dispel the sense of dull routine could only help." Released on Christmas, the film took in $7.3 million over the weekend for an estimated total of $19.7 million in ticket sales. The movie's budget was $42 million.
And yet, in spite of the terrible reviews, there I was on a rainy Friday in a Manhattan theater with about 20 other people waiting for the movie to start. But I went in with a different attitude from critics': What if the movie was so terrible that it's actually a great theatrical experience, à la Tommy Wiseau's "The Room"?
[Read our review of "Holmes & Watson"]
Here's the thing: I've always loved bad movies. Really, loved them. But for a bad movie to be so terrible it's redeemable, it must have certain characteristics, like unrealistic dialogue and canyon-size plot holes. The first "Mortal Kombat" movie? Good, even with the campy action scenes. "Mortal Kombat: Annihilation"? Even better -- poor Johnny Cage! "Star Trek Generations" is one of my favorites of the franchise, even though it nonsensically left Kirk to die under a bridge.
The telltale sign of a good bad movie: Do you find yourself laughing at all, and especially when you're not supposed to? Every gruesome scene from "Street Fighter" is comical to me. If you're scrolling through channels and the movie is on, would you stop and ironically watch it? If I come across 1993's "Super Mario Bros.," I'm hoping to catch the scene of Goombas appearing in an elevator. (Yes, there's a trend with movies based on video games.)
And a good bad movie must not take itself too seriously. On that front, "The Godfather: Part III" fails.
The gold standard for bad movies that became good is "Plan 9 From Outer Space," directed by Edward D. Wood Jr in 1959. Its star, Gregory Walcott, said that the script, about aliens attacking Earth by resurrecting the dead, "made no sense." The film was to feature Bela Lugosi, but he died before shooting began, so Wood used unrelated footage he'd shot of the horror star -- and a noticeably taller body double.
Despite -- or because of -- its continuity errors, low production value and absurd dialogue, the film became a cult favorite. It now has a 67 percent rating on Rotten Tomatoes because it is "unintentionally hilarious" and displays "staggering ineptitude," the site says.
With "Holmes & Watson," some audience members hated it so much that they put up social media posts saying they had walked out before the film finished. Todd Moye, a history professor at the University of North Texas, told me, "The projector conked out midway through the showing I took my family to and I got my money back. Luckiest break I've ever gotten in a movie theater."
When asked by email about reported walkouts, representatives for AMC and Regal, two big theater chains showing the movie, perhaps unsurprisingly did not respond.
At the Friday showing, the film began with an ominous sign: It didn't. After a projector malfunction that left the audience in the dark for about 20 minutes, we finally watched Watson disguising himself as a manure salesman in one scene and, in another, conducting a, shall we say, sexy autopsy alongside his crush. (At least his crush wasn't the body.) Not done yet, Watson later lactates. It's not like Holmes fares any better, with lengthy attempts at urination humor.
Two men walked out midway through the showing. I bounded out after them to ask them why. Both declined to be interviewed. One simply said, "Going to go watch a football game." (Purdue and Auburn were facing off.)
I did find some endearing moments, like a catchy musical number written by the Oscar-winning composer Alan Menken and the lyricist Glenn Slater, sung by Ferrell and Reilly near the movie's end. There are fun cameos, including from the actor Billy Zane and the wrestler Braun Strowman.
And two bits got chuckles out of me: one when Holmes put on a "Make England Great Again" hat. (There are several references to President Trump and the plight of American democracy.) The other was an anachronistic spin class that took place in a gym.
After the movie ended, I ran into Manny Alvarez and his wife, Reizel, who were visiting from Miami. Let's call them the 9 Percent.
"I loved the movie -- I thought it was funny," Reizel Alvarez said. She also said it was her birthday.
"It was interesting," Manny Alvarez chimed in. "I liked the fact that they were comparing their democracy and comparing it to what we have in the United States. I thought that was kind of cute."
Then there was Andy Sanchez and Hunter Freeman, a married couple who were fans of Ferrell and Reilly's past works, like "Step Brothers." They went into "Holmes & Watson" knowing about the bad reviews.
"Honestly, I didn't really like it," Andy Sanchez (literally) yawned as he told me. Freeman said she fell asleep inside the theater. "I still wanted to give it a shot because Will Ferrell, I give him the benefit of the doubt," Sanchez said.
To me, "Holmes & Watson" lacks ironic rewatchability because it actually tries (and fails) to be funny. But I wondered what this couple thought: Was the movie so bad it might be good?
"I know what you mean," Sanchez said. "This isn't one of them."
Photograph John C. Reilly as Dr. Watson, left, and Will Ferrell as Sherlock Holmes in the heavily panned "Holmes & Watson." Funny, vulgar and filled with satirical swipes at Donald Trump, the movie may eventually find redemption as a campy classic. (PHOTOGRAPH BY GILES KEYTE/ CTMG INC.)
