Texto completo: All you have to do is beat him.
Donald Trump is not a Caesar; he does not bestride our narrow world like a colossus, undefeatable save by desperate or underhanded means. He is an instinct-driven chancer who has exploited the decadence of his party and the larger system to grasp and hold a certain kind of power.
But he is also a reckless and distracted figure, a serial squanderer of opportunities, who barely won the presidency and whose coalition is united only in partisan solidarity and fear of liberalism. He may not be removable by the impeachment process, but is not a king; he is a widely hated, legislatively constrained president facing a difficult reelection.
All you have to do is beat him.
For a long time during Trump’s ascent I wrote columns demanding that the leaders of the Republican Party do something to keep this obviously unfit, chaotic, cruel man from becoming their nominee for president. Those columns were morally correct but structurally naive, based on theories of party decision-making that no longer apply in our era of institutional decay.
But Trump could have been stopped in the Republican primaries the old-fashioned way — by being beaten at the polls. His base was limited, his popularity fluctuated, and if his rivals had recognized the threat earlier, campaigned against him consistently, strategized with one another more effectively, and avoided their own meltdowns and missteps, there was no reason he could not have been defeated.
All you have to do is beat him.
After Trump’s administration began and immediately descended into chaos, I had one last flare of institutionalism, one last moment of outrage and 25th Amendment fantasy. But since then I have left the outrage to my liberal friends, watching them put their hopes in Robert Mueller’s investigation, in law enforcement and intelligence agency leaks and whistleblowing, and finally — though with less real hope and more grim resignation — in the House’s articles of impeachment.
Now that last effort is ending, as everyone with eyes could see it would, with the Republicans who failed to beat Trump when it counted declining to turn on him now that partisan consolidation and improving national conditions have sealed their base to him. The mix of expedience and cravenness with which the institutional GOP approached impeachment is no different than the way the institutional GOP behaved during Trump’s initial ascent, and it leaves Trump’s opposition no worse off than before. A failed impeachment doesn’t give him new powers or new popularity; it just shows that the normal way to be rid of an unpopular president is the way that Democrats must take.
All you have to do is beat him.
Of course, in trying to beat him they have to cope with the fact that he is chronically unscrupulous, as the Biden-Ukraine foray shows. And they have to overcome the advantage that his particular coalition enjoys in the Electoral College.
But in other ways the Democrats are lucky to have Trump to run against, as they were lucky in 2016. In a year when the fundamentals mildly favored Republicans, Hillary Clinton got to face off against the most-disliked GOP nominee of modern times. And she would have beaten him — even with Russia, even with Comey — had her campaign taken just a few more steps to counter his team’s long-shot strategy to flip the Midwest.
All you have to do is beat him.
As with 2016, so with politics since. Liberal hand-wringing about their structural disadvantages ignores the advantages that Trump keeps giving them — the fact that in the best economy in 20 years he can’t stop making people hate him, can’t stop missing opportunities to expand his base, can’t stop forcing vulnerable Republicans to kiss his ring and thereby weaken their own prospects.
Impeachment has only extended this pattern, with Republicans voting to shorten the trial even when it makes them look like lackeys, and too cowed in many cases to even take the acquit-but-still-condemn approach that Democrats took with Bill Clinton. So now most of the country thinks the president did something wrong, most of the country thinks Republicans are protecting him, and most of the country is open, entirely open, to voting Trump and the most vulnerable Republican senators out in nine short months.
All you have to do is beat him.
It’s worth remembering, too, that liberalism is not just struggling in America, with our Electoral College and right-tilting Senate; it is struggling all around the world. Which, again, suggests that American liberals are fortunate to have Trump as their Great Foe. If he were merely as disciplined and competent as Boris Johnson or Viktor Orban, to choose leaders with whom he has a few things in common, he would be coasting to reelection.
Instead it is very likely that he will lose. But it was likely that he would lose in 2016 as well. One essential lesson of the Trump era is that likelihoods are not enough; if you want to end the Trump era, only one thing will suffice.
You have to beat him.

HER Food Shalabi Column

Texto completo: The theme for this month's issue of Her magazine is relationships. And I, of course, write about food, and in particular, how food is a great way to bring people together.
So when I was contemplating my topic for this month's column, I thought: Food ... bringing people together ... relationships. I got it! Aphrodisiacs.
There is one supposed aphrodisiac that is on everyone's mind this time of year and that is chocolate.
According to researchers, there is some science behind the idea of chocolate as an aphrodisiac. It comes down to two chemicals that chocolate contains: Tryptophan - a building block of serotonin, a brain chemical involved in sexual arousal; and phenylethylamine, a stimulant related to amphetamine that is released in the brain when people fall in love.
But scientists also concede that these chemicals occur in such small amounts that there really isn't a measurable effect on desire.
This also is the conclusion of an Italian study on the effects of chocolate on desire. (Leave it to the Italians do this type of research.)
In a study, three groups of women younger than 35 (apparently, women are more sensitive to these chemicals than men) consumed chocolate either once per day, three times per day or no times per day (it would have been sad to be in that group). They all self-reported no discernible effect on their desire, either positive or negative.
This, of course, leads everyone to conclude that chocolate is like any other aphrodisiac. Its effect is more psychological than physiological.
This sad, but not surprising, news does not diminish chocolate's other popular trait: Its deliciousness.
To help you feel less guilty about eating it, there are all kinds of other health claims associated with chocolate, especially dark chocolate - the kind that says 70 percent (or higher) on the label. This type of chocolate contains antioxidants, fiber, potassium, calcium, copper and magnesium.
That brought up another question that sent me hunting for some answers.
How does dark chocolate differ from milk chocolate, from bittersweet chocolate, from semisweet chocolate, from white chocolate? There is a seemingly endless list of types of chocolate to choose from, especially when you are baking or making desserts.
Here is what I found out: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has rules on this. There are three main types of chocolate: Milk chocolate, dark chocolate and white chocolate. The differences among them are related to ingredients and how they are made.
Chocolate liquor
Sometimes referred to as unsweetened chocolate, this is the base of all types of chocolate. This thick, dark brown paste is created from cacao nibs - the inside of the cocoa bean. The nibs are finely ground to a smooth texture and when heated, this paste turns into a liquid that can be formed into bars or chips. Chocolate liquor is 100 percent cocoa, with no added ingredients. Under high pressure, this paste separates into cocoa butter and cocoa powder. (Interesting fact: Chocolate liquor does not contain alcohol.)
White chocolate
This is easy to identify because of its creamy white color. It is made by combining sugar, cocoa butter, milk, vanilla and lecithin (an emulsifier that helps the ingredients blend together). These ingredients give white chocolate its sweet vanilla aroma. Good quality white chocolate will have a rich, soft, and creamy texture - a characteristic that comes from its cocoa butter base and high sugar and milk content.
White chocolate is unique because it does not contain any cocoa solids. The cocoa solids are what give chocolate its dark brown color and chocolaty taste. According to the FDA, in order to be considered white chocolate, it must contain at least 20% cocoa butter, 14% milk and no more than 55% sugar.
Milk chocolate
With its light brown color, creamy texture and sweet flavor, milk chocolate is widely regarded as the most popular type of chocolate. It is made by combining chocolate liquor with sugar, and milk. According to the FDA, milk chocolate must contain at least 10% chocolate liquor and 12% milk.
Dark chocolate
Dark chocolate sometimes is referred to as black or semisweet chocolate and is noticeably less sweet than milk chocolate. It typically is made from only two ingredients - chocolate liquor and sugar. Sometimes, small amounts of vanilla and soy lecithin (an emulsifier) are added. According to the FDA, dark chocolate must contain at least 15% chocolate liquor but usually contains closer to about 50%
Bittersweet chocolate
Bittersweet chocolate has become more popular in recent years as people started to learn more about cacao and cocoa percentages. (This is the kind of chocolate with the supposed health benefits.)
Semisweet and bittersweet chocolate share the same FDA definition and must contain more than 35% chocolate liquor, although they generally contain at least 50% cocoa liquor. Bittersweet chocolate typically is 66% cocoa content or higher. (The added sugar usually is less than one-third of the total content.) And 70% cocoa content or higher is when scientists say the health benefits kick in.
Cocoa powder
This is created when chocolate liquor is separated under high pressure and the resulting cocoa solids are crushed into a powder. Unsweetened cocoa powder is 100% cocoa.
There are two types of cocoa powder: Natural cocoa and dutch-processed cocoa. Natural cocoa is lighter brown in color and has a strong chocolate flavor that often is acidic. Dutch cocoa is natural cocoa that has been alkalized to neutralize the acidity. The dutch-process gives the cocoa powder a deep, warm color and slightly milder flavor.
As an avid cook and struggling baker, I found this information interesting and particularly useful when I think about the many things that there are to bake with chocolate. (And I always wondered what Dutch processed cocoa powder was.)
As you approach this season of appreciating your honey or feeling sad about your lack of a honey, think about chocolate as a way to mark the occasion.
Information in this article on the chemicals in chocolate that cause arousal and Italian study on desire and chocolate were taken from the article, "The Claim: Chocolate is an Aphrodisiac," by Anahad O'Connor and published in the New York Times on July 18, 2006.
Information on the different types of chocolates comes from the Lake Champlain Chocolates website.

Easy Chocolate Souffle
1 stick, softened, unsalted butter plus more for coating
4 tablespoon granulated sugar, plus more for coating dish
8 ounces bittersweet chocolate (60-65% cacao), finely chopped (can substitute milk chocolate for all or some of bittersweet chocolate for a sweeter end result)
6 eggs, separated, at room temperature
Pinch fine sea salt
½ teaspoon cream of tartar
Remove wire racks from oven and place a baking sheet directly on the oven floor. Heat oven to 400 degrees. Generously butter a 1-1/2-quart soufflé dish. Coat bottom and sides thoroughly with sugar, tapping out excess. For the best rise, make sure there is sugar covering all the butter on the sides of the dish.
In a medium bowl, melt chocolate and butter either in the microwave or in a bowl over a pot of simmering water. Let cool only slightly (it should still be warm), then whisk in egg yolks and salt.
Using an electric mixer, beat egg whites and cream of tartar at medium speed until the mixture is fluffy and holds very soft peaks. Add sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time, beating until whites hold stiff peaks and look glossy.
Gently whisk a quarter of the egg whites into the chocolate mixture to lighten it. Fold in remaining whites in two additions, then transfer batter to prepared dish. Rub your thumb around the inside edge of the dish to create about a ¼-inch space between the dish and the soufflé mixture.
Transfer dish to baking sheet in the oven, and reduce oven temperature to 375 degrees. Bake until soufflé is puffed and center moves only slightly when dish is shaken gently, about 25-35 minutes. (Do not open the oven door during the first 20 minutes.) Bake it a little less for a runnier soufflé and a little more for a firmer soufflé. Serve immediately with sweetened whipped cream.

Longtime Art Museum staffer taking retirement

Texto completo: Marla K. Shoemaker, a veteran of nearly a half-century at the Philadelphia Museum of Art, is retiring, museum head Timothy Rub announced to the staff in an email Wednesday.
Shoemaker is senior curator of education and head of the division of education and public programs.
"Marla told me some time ago of her desire to step away, but graciously agreed to my request to stay on a bit longer both to oversee planning for the renewal and expansion of our educational activities after the completion of the core [construction] project, and to enable us to defer the start of a national search for her successor until this year," Rub wrote. "She has more than fulfilled this commitment and recently indicated to me that she is ready to move on."
In a letter to Rub dated Jan. 31, Shoemaker said she had felt "for some time that the moment has come to step down and turn my attention to other things." She said the approach of the completion of the core project, the museum's transformative building effort due to wrap up in September, "is an opportune moment to seek new leadership in education."
Shoemaker began work at the museum right out of Oberlin College in 1973.
Rub cited the "continued expansion of our educational programming over the past two decades," as well as the introduction of many initiatives for K-12 schools, as part of her legacy.
In the last several months, in addition to overseeing the museum's educational efforts, Shoemaker has had to field a number of concerns growing from the employment of Joshua R. Helmer, a former museum manager who worked closely with education and outreach efforts.
Helmer was the subject of a New York Times article last month that reported he had entered into sexual relationships with subordinate female staffers at the museum, offering the possibility for professional advancement as enticement. Helmer left the museum in 2018 and subsequently was hired as director of the Erie Art Museum. He departed Erie in the wake of the Times report.
Among other things, in November Shoemaker informed the staff that Helmer had been barred from the museum.
Shoemaker's retirement will be effective Feb. 19. Rub said a national search is underway for her successor and an interim management team will be put in place for the education department.

New Bronx Stadium Within Reach for Major League Soccer's NYC FC; Proposed plan would include affordable housing, a school and shops

Texto completo: New York City's major-league soccer team moved a step closer to a deal for a home stadium in the Bronx.
Developers partnering with the team on a new stadium proposal reached an agreement last month with the city and the New York Yankees, which are part owners of the New York City FC soccer team that plays in Major League Soccer, according to one of the developers.
Under the agreement, the developers would build a soccer stadium in the south Bronx near Yankee Stadium. The project would also include affordable housing, a school and shops.
But complicated details still need to be resolved before there is a deal, and the agreement is nonbinding, according to one of the developers, Maddd Equities LLC.
"There are a lot of moving parts to this deal," said Jorge Madruga. chief executive of Maddd Equities, one of the developers involved. "We are investing a lot of money and time and have a lot of people working on this to make it happen."
The proposed development would rise on several lots near Yankee Stadium on River Avenue in the Bronx. Some parcels in the area are controlled by the Bronx Parking Development Corp., a nonprofit that operates parking lots serving Yankee Stadium.
Those lots were part of a deal when the new stadium was built requiring the city to provide 9,300 parking spaces for fans. But many fans have opted to take cheaper public transportation to the games, leaving many underused spaces and the Bronx Parking Development in default of bondholders.
Under the proposal the developers would purchase those lots, a person familiar with discussions said. In addition, the Yankees have committed to reducing the requirement of parking spaces from 9,300 to 6,300. The project would require a public approval process.
"The situation with Bronx Parking had started to seriously deteriorate and a solution had to be reached, which led to the opportunity to create an overall plan," said Randy Levine, president of the New York Yankees.
A new home stadium for the soccer team would end the constant problem of displacement for long-suffering fans. The soccer team plays its home games at Yankee Stadium, but scheduling conflicts have meant some critical "home" matches have had to be moved to Citi Field. Later this month, the club will play a home match in the Concacaf Champions League at the stadium of its arch rival in New Jersey.
The Yankees are part of a venture that owns NYC FC with an Abu Dhabi investment group, which also owns Manchester City in the English Premier League. The Yankees introduced Maddd Equities, which has a number of affordable developments in the Bronx, with the soccer club to collaborate on the development that would bring affordable housing and a stadium, a person familiar with the discussions said.
Previous proposals have fallen through. The developers and city representatives have been moving carefully and reaching out to community groups. The city's Economic Development Corp., which signed the nonbinding agreement, said that additional work needs to be done.
"A deal has not been reached and more conversations are needed—especially with members of the local community on their needs and vision for the area," the spokeswoman said.
The New York Times earlier reported that the developers, the team's owners and the city are nearing an agreement that would allow the stadium to be built.

Texto completo: Facebook and Twitter have refused to take down a video posted by President Donald Trump that was edited to make it appear that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ripped up his speech when the president was saluting a Tuskegee airman during the State of the Union rather than at the end of his address.
The video intersperses Pelosi tearing the speech again and again following other big moments from Trump's address.
Trump's campaign says the video is a parody. But Pelosi's office had demanded the video, titled “Powerful American stories ripped to shreds by Nancy Pelosi,” be removed from both social media platforms. Trump tweeted the video Thursday evening to his more than 72 million followers.
The spat became public Friday when Pelosi’s deputy chief of staff Drew Hammill tweeted: “The latest fake video of Speaker Pelosi is deliberately designed to mislead and lie to the American people, and every day that these platforms refuse to take it down is another reminder that they care more about their shareholders’ interests than the public’s interests. ”

“The American people know that the president has no qualms about lying to them – but it is a shame to see Twitter and Facebook, sources of news for millions, do the same," he continued.
Facebook said the Trump video does not violate its policy on manipulated video. Twitter said the video does not violate its current rules. New rules on altered videos are slated to take effect on March 5.
The video had been viewed 2. 1 million times in less than 24 hours, reaching nearly 5 million people, Trump campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh said.
“If Nancy Pelosi fears images of her ripping up the speech, perhaps she shouldn’t have ripped up the speech,” he told USA TODAY.
Video clips deceptively altered to discredit or embarrass political figures or to mislead voters are a growing problem on social media platforms, which are increasingly playing a central role in American political life. This new wave of dirty political tricks is raising broad concerns about the role of digital manipulation in swaying voter sentiment in U. S. elections.
Tech giants have been wrestling with how to combat disinformation that seeks to deceive and sway voters after Russian interference and the spread of fabricated news stories influenced public opinion during the 2016 presidential election. Manipulated video is expected to increase sharply in the months before the November election.

The state of the union between Democrats and social media companies is fraying.
House Democrats including Rep. David Cicilline, D-R. I. , to Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif. , complained loudly on Twitter, calling on the social media company to remove the Trump video.
“Social media platforms are a place where people come for news & information. They need to have certain standards,” Khanna tweeted. “Falsity has never been part of our 1st Amendment tradition. ”
Rep. Veronica Escobar, D-Texas, aimed her comment directly at Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey: "Show your commitment to cut down on the misinformation corroding our nation and take down this fake video. "
Open season on Facebook: Top Democrats Joe Biden and Nancy Pelosi take on Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg
'Shameful behavior': Nancy Pelosi isn't accepting Facebook's friend request
Social media companies are taking a lot of flak from leading Democrats, who've grown more openly hostile in recent weeks.
Last month Joe Biden ramped up the Democrats' open season on Facebook and its CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, during an interview with the New York Times.
"I've never been a fan of Facebook," the former vice president said. "I've never been a big Zuckerberg fan. I think he's a real problem. "
Biden's comments followed sharp words from Pelosi who, in response to a question about Facebook's power, said: “I think what they have said very blatantly, very clearly is that they intend to be accomplices for misleading the American people with money from God knows where. "

WASHINGTON—The Justice Department has closed its antitrust investigation of four auto makers that had reached a tailpipe emissions deal last summer with the state of California, according to people familiar with the matter.
After examining the matter for several months, the department concluded that the auto makers—Ford Motor Co., Honda Motor Co., BMW AG and Volkswagen AG—didn't engage in conduct that violated U.S. antitrust law, the people said.
At issue was a July agreement between the auto makers and the California Air Resources Board on fuel efficiency standards, a state-based framework that is at odds with the Trump administration's regulatory approach.
Justice Department officials questioned whether the companies agreed among themselves on the outlines of the deal with California regulators, and the auto makers received formal civil subpoenas in the fall.
Mary Nichols, chairwoman of the California Air Resources Board, has said the state worked individually with the auto makers and that all parties were mindful of not violating antitrust laws.
The New York Times first reported the Justice Department's closing of the probe.
The Justice Department had started investigating the companies amid larger conflicts between the Trump administration and California, often on environmental grounds. In September, the administration moved to take away California's ability to set its own vehicle emissions standards, and then informed state leaders that their air-pollution plans might be incomplete or unworkable, putting billions of dollars in federal aid for the state at risk .
The friction over the future of the auto industry has been the biggest conflict. Since its earliest days, the Trump administration has been attempting to roll back rules California had set in collaboration with the Obama administration to reduce tailpipe emissions. Leaders in the Republican administration want to curb Democratic-dominated California's influence over rules governing the industry .
The four companies announced a deal in July to support rules set by the California Air Resources Board, betting it was the best way to ensure one set of nationwide emissions standards. Justice Department officials said at the time they believed the agreement could effectively restrict competition by potentially limiting the types of cars and trucks the auto companies offer to consumers, according to people familiar with the department's thinking.
That investigation had effectively frozen any progress on negotiations to further detail or expand the pact. No other companies have announced interest in joining since the start of the investigation. Several companies that hadn't announced interest intervened on behalf of the Trump administration in October in a lawsuit over its proposed rollback of new tailpipe-emissions rules.

Fear and loathing in the Democratic Party

Texto completo: President Trump has been criticized for running an undisciplined, chaotic administration. But in the last few months, Americans believe the Democrats have been giving him a run for his money. Among the 500 voters I have been in conversation with since Trump took office, the Republicans have certainly noticed the disorder — but now the Democrats are cringing, too, and they are looking urgently for a turnaround.
Start with the chaos that emerged from a failed app that was supposed to collate results in Iowa. The Republican National Committee was quick to send a message that if the Democrats can't run a caucus, then they certainly cannot run the United States. As Democratic voter Al from California said, “All of us in tech understand how to test apps. I mean, you have everyone download it a month early, and you do several test runs, and you work out the bugs. How can this even have happened?"
This debacle followed what many perceived to be a misdirected and poorly run impeachment process. Democratic voters are flummoxed that among a range of potentially impeachable offenses by the president (emoluments, obstruction of justice from the Mueller report, and so on), leaders decided to go for broke on an issue related to Ukraine, which, for many Americans, seemed obscure and difficult to fully understand.
Some Democrats found it mystifying that Speaker Nancy Pelosi rushed the impeachment process through the House, then refused to pass the articles on to the Senate for three weeks. And fewer than 10 percent reported that they watched the Senate trial, with most others saying it was either “boring" or a foregone conclusion. “Why read the book if you already know the ending?" asked Terrence from New York. Jeremy from Massachusetts found the whole impeachment process upsetting: “Literally every branch of government conspired to prevent me from knowing the truth. The White House obstructed. The House rushed their investigation, while the Senate did not conduct what could traditionally be characterized as a trial."
Impeachment aside, the electoral process looks fragmented and confusing. “This is the most important presidential race I have ever witnessed and the Dems' start feels pretty weak, I am sorry to say," said Nancy from Connecticut. Layer on top of that a set of debate rules that have shifted inexplicably, with a decision by the Democratic National Committee to change debate criteria and allow former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg to participate in the debate — even when they would not do this for former candidates Cory Booker and Julián Castro. #TomPerezResign, referencing the chair of the Democratic National Committee, is justifiably trending on Twitter.
It all adds up to a sense of frustration about whether Democrats can make sense of anything in a rough-and-tumble election season. Said Lynnnie from North Carolina, “The GOP can speak with one voice, and so far, the Dems are speaking in many voices. This takes away from the voters' focus. So the GOP comes across as having it all together, while the Democrats come across as scattered." Added Tom, also from North Carolina, “When I really let my guard down, I am concerned for the organization of the Democrats. They don't seem nearly as hungry and focused as the Republicans."
Voters worry about the perception that all the Democrats care about is impeachment and investigations, when they should be laser-focused on health care, immigration, infrastructure, and the opioid crisis.
The combination of Democratic disarray and Trumpian chaos has created the one perspective that so many on both sides of the aisle can share: Nobody is steering the ship particularly well. As Jeremy put it, “As a country, we desperately need better political leaders." And it's only February. We're nine months, 49 state contests, and a bruising election season away from determining who the next president will be. Whether it's Trump or a Democrat, they'll be stuck with an electorate that's restless and angry about the tumultuous state of government. That — more than any particular issue — may be the biggest challenge the country faces if it ever hopes to settle down and do the work of the people, by the people, and for the people.

The Iowa App and the Clinton Cabal; There's money to be made in "progressive" politics.

Texto completo: What do you get when you combine Team Clinton's business savvy with panicked Democrats eager to counter Donald Trump's use of digital technology? Behold the Iowa Democratic Party's caucus reporting app.
In competitive elections, you win some and you lose some. But if you can create recurring revenue streams from both the national and state offices of one of America's two leading political parties, you can win every time! For Democratic tech vendors, the timing is perfect as party officials look to digital investments to counter a perceived Trump advantage.
People will continue to debate which Democrats deserve the most blame for their worst-in-the-nation caucus performance on Monday. The latest twist in the tale comes from Jason Clayworth, who reports in the Des Moines Register:
The reporting app that is getting a large share of the blame for the chaos surrounding Monday's Democratic caucus results was working until the national party required the installation of a security patch less than 48 hours before the first-in-the-nation contest, a recent member of the Iowa Democratic Central Committee said Thursday.
As for the creators of the app, people outside of the political world may find it increasingly difficult to understand how they were ever hired. The company charged with building the essential technology has a short and unsuccessful history. But it does have valuable connections.
Michael Biesecker and Brian Slodysko reported for the Associated Press on Tuesday:
The little-known technology start-up under scrutiny after the meltdown of the Iowa Democratic caucuses on Monday was founded little more than a year ago by veterans of Hillary Clinton's failed 2016 presidential campaign who had presented themselves as gurus of campaigning in the digital era.
Shadow Inc. was picked in secret by the Iowa Democratic Party after its leaders consulted with the Democratic National Committee...
Just who works at Shadow was not clear on the company's webpage Tuesday. But resumes posted on the online business networking site LinkedIn show the company's top executives all worked in the Clinton campaign's digital operation in 2016.
Who would have thought Bernie Sanders fans wouldn't be suspicious enough of people seeking profits? Since the app disaster some Sandernistas have been busy online venting suspicions of some kind of conspiracy to rig the caucus results. A more likely explanation is that the Clinton crowd was simply trying to suck revenue out of state Democratic organizations like Iowa's.
The for-profit firm Shadow run by former Clinton hacks might not even exist without help from a firm called Acronym, which is organized as a non-profit under the tax laws.
At the intersection of money and Democratic politics, it turns out to be a very small world. James Hohmann reported in the Washington Post in 2018:
Tara McGowan, who runs Acronym, oversaw a $42 million digital program in 2016 for Priorities USA, the primary super PAC for Hillary Clinton.
A Tuesday New York Times report from Matthew Rosenberg, Nick Corasaniti, Sheera Frenkel and Nicole Perlroth revealed how crucial Acronym's support was to the "success" of the tech venture:
Acronym... quietly invested millions of dollars in a nearly bankrupt company called Groundbase, a tech firm that renamed itself Shadow soon after... its main technology, a texting platform designed for campaigns, failed to catch on as users complained that it was slow and cumbersome.
The failure left the firm perilously underfunded, and it was close to shutting down when Acronym stepped in with an infusion of cash... The new money brought new projects...
There were also new clients. According to the most recent campaign filing reports, Shadow earned roughly $150,000 last year working for the Nevada and Wisconsin state Democratic parties and three presidential campaigns — those of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., Pete Buttigieg, former mayor of South Bend, Ind., and Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, who dropped out of the race in August.
As for the app at the heart of the Iowa debacle, the Times reports:
Shadow was put into a race that engineers at the most well-resourced tech giants, like Google, said could not be won. There was simply not enough time to build the app, test it widely to work out major bugs and then train its users.
Shadow was also handicapped by its own lack of coding know-how, according to people familiar with the company. Few of its employees had worked on major tech projects, and many of its engineers were relatively inexperienced.
How inexperienced was the Shadow workforce? Emily Glazer, Deepa Seetharaman and Alexa Corse report in the Journal:
One of its workers recently was a prep cook for Starbucks. Another was a teacher.
So how on earth did this firm get hired? It seems that the Shadow crew wasn't going to impress anyone with its technology chops. The Journal reports:
... over the past year, Acronym and its founder Tara McGowan made introductions that allowed Shadow to secure some contracts with state Democratic parties and presidential campaigns, according to people familiar with the matter.
In a Nov. 21 private email to donors and friends, Ms. McGowan described Shadow as "a political technology company owned by Acronym." She said Shadow had a "trial contract" with the Democratic National Committee and would make its flagship product, Lightrail, available to all the state parties and all the presidential candidates, according to the email that was reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.
But there was just one little recurring problem with this tech company—its tech. The Journal reports:
Over the past year, Shadow pitched products including a texting app and a data integration tool, but got a mixed reception. Several people who saw the presentations or were briefed on them said the technology wasn't impressive and didn't stand out among the crowd of vendors. Others were sharply critical.
Democrats may or may not succeed in defeating Donald Trump this November. But regardless of the election outcome, at least a few of them are sure to be winners.

Texto completo: The legacy of a late Hudson Valley artist, whose paintings captured the sinister hauntings of Soviet communism and celebrated the triumphant abandon of the Grateful Dead, will be showcased during a new exhibit on the campus of SUNY New Paltz. "Jan Sawka: The Place of Memory (The Memory of Place)" opens Saturday and will run through July 12 at the Samuel Dorsky Museum of Art's Morgan Anderson Gallery and Howard Greenberg Family Gallery. An opening reception will be held from 5-7 p.m. on Saturday.
The Sawka exhibit, according to the Dorsky, "is made up of works that illuminate two aspects of his practice: his fascination with human consciousness, in this case, with memory, and his interest in place and the places through which a human life passes."
Hanna Sawka, a High Falls resident, daughter of the Polish artist and co-curator of the exhibit, said this show features "pieces playing off each other. It's a wonderful opportunity to bring works together that are telling a story."
She continued, "The art is going to communicate with people. People are going to experience it and that's what it was made for. The art is living its full purpose. That makes me so happy."
This exhibit offers compelling angles from a range of perspectives and comes as another Sawka exhibit unfolds in California. "Golden West? Jan Sawka's California Dream" opened Feb. 1 and will run through May 9 at the Robert and Frances Fullerton Museum of Art at California State University in San Bernardino.
Under the Polish government controlled by the Soviets, Sawka led street demonstrations as a leader in the nation's student protest movement. In 1969, he was imprisoned in a military punishment camp. In 1976, Sawka was expelled from Poland, along with his wife and daughter. The family lived in New York City and ultimately settled in High Falls, Ulster County.
"There is a long history of visitors and immigrants to the Hudson Valley, who find their solace here," said Anna Conlan, curator and exhibitions manager for the Dorsky. "You find a special place here. And a lot of this exhibit touches on how this is part of Jan Sawka's story."
The New York Times and Boston Globe op-ed pages are among the places where Sawka's work has been featured. In 1989, his work unfolded as a 52-piece, 10-story art installation that served as the stage backdrop for the Grateful Dead's 25th anniversary tour.
Sawka's work also exhibited at the SUNY New Paltz College Art Gallery prior to the construction of the Dorsky, which opened in 2001.
The artist played a pivotal role in encouraging his gallerist, Samuel Dorsky, to make the lead financial gift as the college expanded its art gallery into what would become the Dorsky. Samuel Dorsky also collected Sawka's art.
"Sam's lead gift to the SUNY New Paltz Foundation provided the impetus for the construction of the new museum building as well as the complete renovation of the former College Art Gallery to become part of the museum," reads www.newpaltz.edu/museum. "The Dorsky Museum now comprises six galleries, offices, and a small teaching space."
The Dorsky family also continues as a major financial supporter of the Dorsky Museum and SUNY New Paltz. Family members serve on the Dorsky advisory board and as trustees of the SUNY New Paltz Foundation.
Providing broad context for the show are exhibit pieces that illustrate – literally – the passion that Sawka maintained for his adopted Hudson Valley home.
All of this, said Conlan, makes the show "a very right fit for us and why we would want to do this show, here and now."
A sense of place Underscoring Jan Sawka's love of the Hudson Valley is a sweeping, 48-foot wide, 12-panel polyptych, "Ashokan 1-4," featuring the Ashokan Reservoir in Ulster. He enjoyed walking at the reservoir because it reminded him of Poland.
Offering contrast are more abstract works, driven by tone and mood.
But, Conlan said, "Once you're in the gallery space and you're surrounded by the large paintings, all that conceptual stuff falls away slightly because they're very powerful when you're standing and experiencing them. They're very compelling."
Speaking of her father at work, Hanna Sawka said, "It was fascinating to watch him. There was such a precision to what he was doing and it was cool to see things form and see what it was becoming."
For "The Place of Memory," she said, "You'll see this work that has a lot happening and makes you think about how you see things. If you look deeply, you're looking at work that shows how your mind works, it shows thought processes."

Meet Wisconsin's most fascinating couple

Texto completo: MOUNTAIN - He was the first transgender person to appear on the TV reality survival show "Naked and Afraid."
She is the author of the 2016 memoir "Welcome to the Goddamn Ice Cube: Chasing Fear and Finding Home in the Great White North," a groundbreaking book that gained critical acclaim for laying bare the sexism, violence and isolation facing a young woman who yearns for adventure in cold, northern and male-dominated regions of the planet.
He once worked as a cowboy but is now in training for the Iditarod, the world's most famous sled dog race. And he's allergic to dogs.
She writes an advice column and was recently name-dropped in a clue to a USA TODAY crossword puzzle.
They are Quince Mountain and Blair Braverman. And even though there's no metric to measure the most interesting married couple in Wisconsin, it's hard to imagine anyone but Mountain and Braverman taking the prize.
They live in a log home on property outside of Mountain, which sprawls along State 32/64 in the southern part of the Nicolet National Forest. It's a town so small it doesn't have a grocery store or school.
It seems an unlikely place to live for a couple who have been regularly featured on National Public Radio, whose writing has been spotlighted in diverse outlets such as the New York Times, The Guardian of London and BuzzFeed, and who have become ambassadors/activists for the LGBTQ+ community. But they love the little town of Mountain. It's a place that supports the passions around which they live their lives: mushing, sled dogs and writing.
Braverman is 31 years old and her resume is wide and deep. She grew up in Davis, California. As a young girl, she yearned for northern reaches of the planet, cold climates and adventure.
"I got into mushing because I was always reading about it as a little kid," Braverman said. "I always say be careful about what your kids read."
Her father is an anti-tobacco researcher, and when she was 10, she and her parents lived in Oslo, Norway, while her father appraised a proposed smoking ban. She moved back to Norway again as a teenage exchange student. She attended a Norwegian folk school that taught her mushing and winter survival.
After completing that course, Braverman went to Colby College in Waterville, Maine, then moved to earn a master's degree in creative nonfiction at the University of Iowa. That's where she met Mountain.
She worked as a dog-mushing tour guide on a glacier in Alaska. She turned those experiences into "Welcome to the Goddamn Ice Cube."
The book propelled her into the spotlight, particularly in the circles of outdoor recreation, where discussions were, and still are, rampant about increasing diversity and widening participation among women, LGBTQ+ people and minorities.
Mountain is a ground-breaker, too. In 2019, he became the first openly transgender person on the survival reality show "Naked and Afraid," which aired in June on the Discovery channel.
Braverman also appeared in a different episode of the show. They believed that they were going to be featured together when they signed up to participate, then producers told them they would be separated.
Mountain grew up in northern Illinois. And as he told the Reno Gazette Journal in June, he endured intense and violent bullying while he grappled with understanding his gender identity.
As a child, he attended a religious Bible camp near Mountain, the town, and learned to work in the camp's horse stables. He found solace there, because gender became less of an issue: He could wear jeans and shirts, and he learned the skills it took to be a horseback rider and cowboy.
He studied philosophy at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and worked as a cowboy. He bought property near Mountain after attending the nearby camp because he grew to love the area. He used horses to skid logs out of the woods to build the log home in which he and Braverman now live.
Their early dates unsurprisingly centered around active, outdoor pursuits.
"I took Blair horseback riding all the time," Mountain said. "We used to go skiing, we used to go skating. ... She did figure skating, I did hockey. All our dates were skating and skiing and skijoring with a dog."
They fell in love. Braverman moved to Mountain's home in Mountain, and in 2016, the two married.
'It's like having kids' Braverman never had a dog team of her own until after she met Mountain.
"I'd been mushing for five or six years by that point," Braverman said. "But I was mushing with other peoples' dogs. It wasn't until we got together that I ever had dogs on my own."
Mountain smiled when she said this because Braverman led him down the dog mushing vortex and he's now as addicted to the sport as she is.
"I just wanted Blair to have a good time so she would stay with me," Mountain said.
They started with just six dogs, enough to pull a sled and race as a kind of hobbyist. But then another Wisconsin musher decided to leave the sport, and Braverman and Mountain took possession of his dogs. Now they have 21 dogs, and the couple formed a team they call Braver Mountain Mushing.
Now dogs are the center of both the team and their lives.
"It's like having kids. They're not on hold," Mountain said. "The first job is always the dogs."
The couple competes with the dogs, but for them, the sport goes so much deeper than that. They have built an online community around Braver Mountain, and it has attracted people far and wide.
It started when they, Braverman primarily, started writing stories about the dogs on Twitter, embracing their personalities and quirks. They added in tidbits about their personal lives, connecting the online community to their writing. Braverman, for example, forthrightly wrote about being in love with a man who is transgender. Mountain has written about the difficulties of growing up and what it's like to be transgender.
So the community that surrounds Braver Mountain is interested partly in dogs, partly in mushing, partly in writing and partly in LBGTQ+ advocacy. And as the online community grew, so did the way Braver Mountain could operate. Part of the funding that helps Braverman and Mountain travel, feed their animals, buy equipment and pay race entry fees comes from crowdfunding.
Right now, 1,404 people have helped the team financially through Patreon. The couple raised nearly $58,000 in a GoFundMe appeal to pay for Mountain to compete in the 2020 Iditarod. He'll be the first openly transgender person to compete in the race. (Braverman placed 36th out of 39 finishers in the 2019 Iditarod.)
Their community goes by the hashtag #uglydogs. In typical Wisconsin fashion (taking the "Cheesehead" insult and embracing it), Braverman and the community used a slur to help forge an identity. In one of her Twitter posts, an online troll told Braverman "to go back to your ugly dogs." The name stuck.
'Our community is so incredibly supportive' Braverman and Mountain say the physical community of Mountain also plays a key role in their success. When they took on the additional dogs, they first approached neighbors, friends and businesses to find out if they could get support in the form of food and other items (for example, they get scraps from a butcher).
They take part in community events by showing up with their dogs and sleds and giving rides, or speaking about the sport. But there also is an undercurrent of acceptance and friendship, Braverman and Mountain say, which runs counter to the stereotypes of close-mindedness, judgment and unfriendliness that often gets cast on rural areas.
"When people want to tell me the Midwest is backwards or something, I mean, nothing pisses me off more," Mountain said. "I've publicly chosen to be out as trans, for better or worse. And when people hear that I live in Wisconsin, it's like 'Oh, you live in the Wisconsin Northwoods. Oooh.' Like I should want to live in a city ... (but) our community is so incredibly supportive. I mean our reluctance to leave here is because there are so many people we know and love, and so many people we know and like."

Susan Collins says she wanted to hear from Bolton and EU ambassador in Trump trial

Texto completo: SOUTH PORTLAND, Maine -- U.S. Sen. Susan Collins of Maine said Friday she wanted to hear from President Donald Trump's former national security adviser and the U.S. ambassador to the European Union before voting to acquit Trump of impeachment charges this week.
Maine's senior senator was one of only two Republicans to join Democrats in a bid to allow witnesses in the Senate's impeachment trial last week, but it failed and Collins voted with every Republican but Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, to acquit the president of two impeachment charges from House Democrats.
Collins was perhaps the most-watched senator during the process, which she largely declined to comment on while citing her role as a juror. She was one of the last Republicans to announce how she would vote on Tuesday and is facing a targeted challenge from national Democrats in her 2020 bid for a fifth term in a blue-leaning Maine.
On Friday after speaking to a police chiefs' conference at a South Portland hotel, Collins told reporters she wished she had heard from former White House national security adviser John Bolton and Ambassador Gordon Sondland during the president's impeachment trial.
An unpublished manuscript from Bolton twice roiled the trial, including when The New York Times reported that the former adviser alleged Trump had told him military aid to Ukraine was on hold because it was tied to the country launching investigations into Democrats.
Trump largely denied those claims, which were tied to Democrats' two articles of impeaching alleging abuse of power relating to a summer call with the Ukrainian leader and obstructing a congressional probe. Sondland told a House committee there was a "quid pro quo" between the aid and investigations after saying the president told him there wasn't one.
Collins broke with her party in voting to subpoena Bolton after the Senate had already voted not to call witnesses in the trial, while she said she would have liked to have heard from Sondland because his House testimony was "contradictory."
"He said that he presumed there was a quid pro quo but nobody ever really challenged him on why he presumed that," she said.
Collins reiterated on Friday morning that she disapproved of Trump's conduct but thought it did not meet the constitutional standard of "high crimes and misdemeanors" to remove a president from office and her vote was not a show of support for the president's actions.
"You don't try to make predictions, you consider the evidence that is before you," she said.
While Collins refused to endorse Trump in 2016, she has been forced into difficult votes during his tenure. Her 2018 vote for U.S. Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh set off a wave of liberal organization against her ahead of her 2020 re-election with more than $10 million spent already on ads focused on the race.
She told CBS News on Tuesday that she believed Trump "learned" from impeachment before walking that back a day later to call the comment "aspirational." Collins faced fresh criticism from opponents over the initial remark, with House Speaker Sara Gideon, one of four Democrats running for the nomination to face her, saying Trump had "learned nothing."
Trump was defiant in a celebratory winding speech on Thursday, insisting he "went through hell" and "did nothing wrong." He has characterized his Ukraine move as "a perfect call," a characterization senators -- including Collins and other Republicans who acquitted him -- have rebuked.

Texto completo: Former U.S. Rep. Joe Walsh is ending his long-shot Republican presidential campaign, days after a crushing defeat in Iowa's leadoff caucuses.
A one-term congressman from Illinois turned radio show host, Mr. Walsh, 58, entered the race in August , seeking to position himself as an alternative to the president. But given Mr. Trump's strong popularity with Republicans and standing as an incumbent president, the odds were always against him.
Mr. Walsh said Friday on CNN that President Trump "can't be beat in the Republican primary." He added: "The party has become a cult."
This week, he placed a distant third in Iowa's leadoff caucuses, earning about 1% of the vote, compared with 97% for Mr. Trump. Former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld—another GOP hopeful—won a little more than 1%.
In an interview with The Wall Street Journal ahead of the caucuses, Mr. Walsh acknowledged he was taking on an uphill battle. A number of states have canceled their Republican primaries and caucuses this year, a move both parties have made when there is an incumbent president.
"I believe in my bones that Donald Trump is unfit," Mr. Walsh said. "And I thought it was really important that there was a Republican out there—a Republican—every day making that case. I knew it would be difficult."
Mr. Walsh has long history of controversial comments, including suggesting wrongly that President Obama is Muslim. Mr. Walsh expressed regret for those remarks in a New York Times opinion piece.

Texto completo: As Iowa Democratic Party officials blamed an app for the delayed release of caucus results, conspiracies started swirling about something more corrupt.

The app that failed in Iowa last night was developed by a software company called Shadow, one such tweet said. Shadow was paid by Pete Buttigieg campaign last summer. Pete Buttigieg has now claimed victory before any precincts have reported. Whats that about election interference?

Heres what we know.

What happened?

The Iowa Democratic Party failed to announce the winner of the states Feb. 3 Democratic caucus because of what it called a coding issue in an app it planned to use to tabulate results, the New York Times reported. People who were briefed on the app by the state party said that it wasnt properly tested on a statewide scale, according to the paper, and reported only partial data.

As part of our investigation, we determined with certainty that the underlying data collected via the app was sound, said Iowa Democratic Party chairman Troy Price. While the app was recording data accurately, it was reporting out only partial data. We have determined that this was due to a coding issue in the reporting system. This issue was identified and fixed. The applications reporting issue did not impact the ability of precinct chairs to report data accurately.

Price also said the party has every indication that our systems were secure and there was not a cybersecurity intrusion.

Multiple county chairs said they struggled to use the app and were put on hold for up to an hour when they called a phone hotline the party has used for decades, according to the Times.

The paper quoted another person who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he had agreed not to discuss the app as saying there were concerns it would malfunction in areas with poor connectivity or when too many people tried to use it at the same time.

What is Shadow?

The app used by the state party was built by a for-profit technology company called Shadow Inc.

According to its website, Shadows mission is to build political power for the progressive movement by developing affordable and easy-to-use tools. One of them, called Lightrail, is described as a data integration and automation tool to help organize data.

Get voter, volunteer and donor data where it needs to go with just a few clicks, the site says. Pull a list of people who RSVPed yes to a MobilizeAmerica event and easily send to a texting tool for confirms.

Shadow also offers a messaging service that campaigns can use to recruit volunteers and mobilize voters.

Who owns Shadow?

The Shadow team is made up of campaign and technology veterans who have built and implemented technology at Google, Apple and the Democratic National Committee, and working on campaigns for Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, according to Shadows website.

Shadow started as Groundbase, according to the Los Angeles Times, a tech developer co-founded by Gerard Niemira and Krista Davis, who worked for the tech team on Hillary Clintons 2016 presidential campaign.

In January 2019, Acronym acquired Groundbase to function as its tech development arm, the newspaper said.

What is Acronym?

Acronym is a Democratic nonprofit that aims to advance progressive causes. You can access Shadows website from Acronyms by clicking on a link about equipping progressive campaigns with the organizing + data tools to win.

After acquiring Groundbase in 2019, Acronym tweeted: Weve acquired SMS tool Groundbase & are launching Shadow, a company focused on building the technology infrastructure needed to enable Democrats to run better, more efficient campaigns.

Reporting on the acquisition at the time, Politico said that Acronym would launch Shadow, a tech company that will operate Groundbase and build other products.

But, amid the Iowa caucus meltdown, Acronym seems to be distancing itself from Shadow. The New York Times reported that Acronym said in a statement that it was a separate entity from Shadow and that it was still waiting to hear about what happened.

TechCrunch reported that language on Acronyms About page changed from saying that in January 2019, it launched Shadow, a tech company focused on enabling organizers to run smarter campaigns to its current language, saying that the nonprofit invested in Shadow.

Acronyms founder and CEO,Tara McGowan, who worked on Obamas 2012 presidential campaign, tweeted on Feb. 4 that Shadow is an independent company Acronym invested in.

We dont have any information beyond the public statements the IDP has put out + like all of you, eagerly await learning what happened and who won the IA caucus, McGowan said.

What about Shadows funding?

The Iowa Democratic Party paid about $60,000 to Shadow, according to the Los Angeles Times. Federal Election Commission disclosures show other state Democratic parties also paid Shadow for services in 2019.

In November, the Democratic Party of Wisconsin paid Shadow $3,750 for subscription fee - text messages, according to filings. The Texas Democratic Party paid $125 for a texting platform and another $125 for online productivity tools. The Nevada State Democratic Party, which will hold the next presidential caucuses, paid $58,000 for technology services.

But CNN reported on Feb. 4 that the Nevada party said it wont use Shadow during its caucuses on Feb. 22.

How is Pete Buttigieg involved?

Even though caucus results were delayed, Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg was triumphant, tweeting early in the morning on Feb. 4 that he was heading to New Hampshire victorious. Later that day, during an interview with MSNBC, he seemed to temper that announcement, saying that the campaign was reviewing internal numbers and began to realize something extraordinary had happened.

Here you have a campaign that was really questioned when we got in for whether we even oughta be here, whether we belonged in this race, and to not only establish that, but to reach the position that we did was a clear victory for our campaign, he said.

On social media, some users started to speculate that what they interpreted as a victory announcement was a sign of corruption. Conspiracy theories began to spread that the election had been rigged in Buttigiegs favor because of his connection to Shadow.

Some claims, such as that the Iowa caucus app was funded by Buttigieg, mischaracterize what we know.

Buttigiegs campaign, Pete for America Inc., paid Shadow $42,500 for software rights and subscriptions.

Sean Savett, a spokesman for the campaign, told PolitiFact that they contracted with Shadow for text messaging services to help them contact voters.

It was totally unrelated to the app Shadow built for the caucuses, he said; Buttigiegs campaign was not involved in the apps development.

Does Shadow have ties to others?

The presidential campaigns for former Vice President Joe Biden and U.S. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, who has since dropped out of the race, also reported paying Shadow for services in 2019.

The New York Times reported that the Iowa Democratic Party was secretive about using the app, and that it asked that Shadows name be withheld from the public. According to a person familiar with the app, its creators had repeatedly questioned the need to keep it secret, especially from the Iowa precincts where it would be used.

On its website, Acronym claims it helped elect 65 progressive candidates across the country with new tech and digital-first strategies to register and turn out voters.

Its founder, McGowan, has voiced support for Buttigieg, tweeting in January 2019 that Mayor Pete is running, with heart-eye emojis.

Texto completo: The death of a Chinese whistleblower doctor who was punished for trying to warn about the coronavirus has triggered a national backlash over freedom of speech and censorship that has overwhelmed official online attempts to contain the expressions of anger.
The swell of indignation that washed across Chinese social media platforms began with conflicting reports over the death of Li Wenliang, 34, an ophthalmologist in Wuhan, the epicenter of the virus outbreak.
Wuhan Central Hospital, where he had worked, finally confirmed that he had died of the virus early Friday, apparently after he contracted it from a patient.
Li had already become a national hero for alerting fellow doctors Dec. 30 in an online post about the emergence of a SARS-like illness, warning them to wear protective clothing to avoid infection.
Li, along with seven others in Wuhan, were later arrested by local security police on charges of spreading rumors and forced to sign a document disavowing his statements and agreeing to quit speaking out.
Coronavirus outbreak: Everything you need to know about the deadly illness alarming the world
As news spread of his illness and subsequent death, online sites exploded with expressions of grief and support, overwhelming the "Great Firewall" that blocks access to certain websites and controls and censors views deemed inappropriate by Chinese authorities.
In many ways, the Li case allowed people with pent-up frustrations in many areas of life to vent.
A post by one of Li's coworkers, an emergency room nurse, said the freezing Wuhan weather was "as gloomy as my mood. "
"To you, we are angels and so strong. But how strong a heart can watch the people around me fall one by one without being shocked?" wrote Li Mengping on her verified account on Sina Weibo, a microblogging service.
"Countless young people will mature overnight after today: the world is not as beautiful as we imagined," one online commenter wrote, according to CNN. "Are you angry? If any of us here is fortunate enough to speak up for the public in the future, please make sure you remember tonight's anger. "
Writing on Weibo, Zeng Guang, the chief epidemiologist for the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, called Li "immortal" and a "hero" for acting so quickly to warn of the impending health crisis.
The outpouring of anger and grief also challenged the Great Firewall directly, demanding an end to censorship.
On Weibo, one of China's biggest social media platforms that's similar to Twitter, a user created the #wewantfreedomofspeech and within 5 hours had over 2 million views and over 5,500 posts, the New York Times reports. It was eventually deleted by censors, along with related topics.
What caused the virus? Pangolins, the heavily trafficked, scaly mammal, may have spread coronavirus to humans
Wang Gaofei, the chief executive of Weibo, which must respond to orders from China's censors, asked in his own post what lessons China should learn from Li’s death. “We should be more tolerant of people who post ‘untruthful information’ that aren’t malicious,” he wrote, according to the Times. “If we’re only allowed to speak what we can guarantee is fact, we’re going to pay prices. ”
Both the Chinese- and English-language Twitter accounts of People’s Daily tweeted that Li’s death had prompted “national grief,” the Times reports. The accounts, apparently after intervention by authorities, deleted those posts and substituted more neutral statements.
“I haven’t seen my WeChat timeline filled with so much forlornness and outrage,” Xu Daniel, founder of a social media analytics company, wrote on the messaging platform WeChat, the Times reports
“Tonight is a monumental moment for our collective conscience,” he wrote in a later post.
Perry Link, Princeton professor emeritus of East Asian studies, says the LI case was an opportunity for people to speak out "without fear of a counter attack" because no one is going to say Li should die.
Link said that with Li turning into a national hero, there was a moment for average people to raise the issue of freedom of speech, without saying so explicitly.
"One reason the Li case is so incendiary and spread so quickly is that people do want freedom of speech, but you can't get online and say it," Link said. "But if you say that the virus spreads if he is muzzled, but unmuzzled there would be fewer deaths, that is essentially saying we need freedom of speech. "
The online outburst is particularly noteworthy in a country with harsh controls on internet use. Freedom House, in its annual survey of Freedom on the Net, listed China for the fourth year in a row as "world's worst abuser of internet freedom".
"Chinese citizens’ risk of being detained or imprisoned for accessing or sharing information online has increased considerably over the past several years," the report says. "Rapid advances in surveillance technology and greater police access to user data have helped facilitate the rise in arrests and prosecutions.
The official propaganda apparatus tried Friday to mollify the public.
"Some of Li Wenliang's experiences during his life reflect shortcomings and deficiencies in epidemic prevention and control," said state television said on its website.
The Chinese ambassador to Washington, Cui Tiankai, said on Twitter, a service frequently blocked by Chinese authorities, "Really saddened by the death of Dr. Li Wenliang. He was a very devoted doctor. We are so grateful to him for what he has done in our joint efforts fighting against #2019nCoV. "
The government announced a team from Beijing would be sent to Wuhan to investigate "issues reported by the masses involving Dr. Li Wenliang. "
Although local authorities later apologized for their actions against Li and the other whistleblowers, millions of Chinese remain unmoved.
Zeng, of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said in a recent interview with Global Times' editor-in-chief Hu Xijin that the eight Wuhan residents who were arrested should be highly praised.
"They were wise before the outbreak," Zengsaid, adding though that any judgment needs to be backed by scientific evidence.
The coronavirus outbreak has claimed 638 lives among more than 31,000 cases. The fatality rate is 2. 1%; that compares to 9. 6% for the SARS virus that created similar concern around the globe in 2002.

DNC chair calls for ‘recanvass' of Iowa results

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- The chairman of the Democratic National Committee on Thursday called for a "recanvass" of the results of the Iowa caucuses, saying it was needed to "assure public confidence" after three days of technical issues and delays.

"Enough is enough," party leader Tom Perez wrote on Twitter.

With 97% of precincts reporting, Pete Buttigieg, a former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders are nearly tied for the lead, and both candidates have declared themselves victorious in the contest. The Associated Press has not called the race.

The Iowa Democratic Party apologized for technical glitches with an app that slowed down reporting of results from Monday's caucuses and has spent the week trying to verify results. However, it was unclear if the state party planned to follow the directive of the national leader to recanvass those results, a process that would likely require state officials to review caucus math worksheets completed at more than 1,600 caucus sites to ensure the calculations were done correctly and matched the reported results.

Iowa chairman Troy Price suggested in a statement Thursday that he would only pursue a recanvass if one was requested by a campaign.

The caucus crisis was an embarrassing twist after months of promoting Iowa as a chance for Democrats to find some clarity in a jumbled 2020 field. Instead, after a buildup that featured seven rounds of debates, nearly $1 billion spent nationwide and a year of political jockeying, caucus day ended with no winner and no official results.

Campaigning in New Hampshire, Sanders called the Iowa Democratic Party's management of the caucuses a "screw-up" that has been "extremely unfair" to the candidates and their supporters.

"I really do feel bad for the people of Iowa," said Sanders, who added that it was "an outrage that they were that unprepared."

Iowa marked the first contest in a primary season that will span all 50 states and several U.S. territories, ending at the party's national convention in July.

As first reported by The New York Times, numerous precincts reported results that contained errors or were inconsistent with party rules. For example, the AP confirmed that dozens of precincts reported more final alignment votes than first alignment votes, which is not possible under party rules. In other precincts, viable candidates lost votes from the first alignment tally to the final, which is also inconsistent with party rules.

Some precincts made apparent errors in awarding state delegate equivalents to candidates. A handful of precincts awarded more state delegate equivalents than they had available. A few others didn't award all of theirs.

The trouble began with an app that the Iowa Democratic Party used to tabulate the results of the contest.

The app was rolled out shortly before caucusing began and did not go through rigorous testing.

The problems were compounded when phone lines for reporting the outcomes became jammed, with many callers placed on hold for hours in order to report outcomes. Party officials said the backlog was exacerbated by calls from people around the country who accessed the number and appeared intent on disrupting the process.

"There was a moment in the night where, it became clear, ‘Oh, the phone number just became available to the entire country,'" said Iowa state Auditor Rob Sands, who was answering calls for the party. "It was a pretty big problem."

President Donald Trump relished in the Democratic turmoil.

"The Democrats, they can't count some simple votes and yet they want to take over your health care system," Trump said at a White House event Thursday celebrating his impeachment trial acquittal. "Think of that -- no, think of that."

The chaos surrounding the reporting breakdown seems sure to blunt the impact of Iowa's election, which typically rewards winners with a surge of momentum heading into subsequent primary contests. But without a winner called, Democrats have quickly turned their focus to New Hampshire, which holds the next voting contest on Tuesday.

The results released so far show Buttigieg and Sanders locked in an exceedingly close contest. They lead Sen. Elizabeth Warren, as well as former Vice President Joe Biden and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar.

The two early leaders, Buttigieg and Sanders, are separated by 40 years in age and conflicting ideology.

Sanders, a 78-year-old self-described democratic socialist, has been a progressive powerhouse for decades. Buttigieg, a 38-year-old former municipal official, represents the more moderate wing of the Democratic Party. Buttigieg is also the first openly gay candidate to earn presidential primary delegates.

Sanders narrowly lost the Iowa caucuses in 2016 to Hillary Clinton and pushed the party to make changes to the process this year, including releasing three different sets of results: a tally of candidate support at the start of the caucuses, their levels of support after those backing candidates with less than 15% got to make a second choice and the number of state delegate equivalents each candidate receives. The AP will determine a winner based on state delegates.

Given the tight race, former DNC Chairwoman Donna Brazile said the party needs to "get this right" so the eventual nominee isn't saddled with questions of legitimacy.

"It's a combination of embarrassment and not being prepared for the various mishaps that can take place when you try to do something new and different," she said.

Party activist John Deeth, who organized the caucuses in Iowa's most Democratic county, Johnson, said he welcomed a recanvass and would help as needed.

"It makes sense to look everything over again and get it right," he said.

Deeth said that he believed the review would uncover some data entry errors as well as some math and rounding errors in how delegates at each precinct were awarded. Volunteers running the precincts did their best, he said, but likely made some minor mistakes.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON—The Trump administration has bought access to a commercial database that maps the movements of millions of cellphones in America and is using it for immigration and border enforcement, according to people familiar with the matter and documents reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.
The location data is drawn from ordinary cellphone apps , including those for games, weather and e-commerce, for which the user has granted permission to log the phone's location.
The Department of Homeland Security has used the information to detect undocumented immigrants and others who may be entering the U.S. unlawfully, according to these people and documents.
U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, a division of DHS, has used the data to help identify immigrants who were later arrested, these people said. U.S. Customs and Border Protection, another agency under DHS, uses the information to look for cellphone activity in unusual places, such as remote stretches of desert that straddle the Mexican border, the people said.
The federal government's use of such data for law enforcement purposes hasn't previously been reported.
Experts say the information amounts to one of the largest known troves of bulk data being deployed by law enforcement in the U.S.—and that the use appears to be on firm legal footing because the government buys access to it from a commercial vendor, just as a private company could, though its use hasn't been tested in court.
"This is a classic situation where creeping commercial surveillance in the private sector is now bleeding directly over into government," said Alan Butler, general counsel of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a think tank that pushes for stronger privacy laws.
According to federal spending contracts, a division of DHS that creates experimental products began buying location data in 2017 from Venntel Inc. of Herndon, Va., a small company that shares several executives and patents with Gravy Analytics, a major player in the mobile-advertising world.
In 2018, ICE bought $190,000 worth of Venntel licenses . Last September, CBP bought $1.1 million in licenses for three kinds of software, including Venntel subscriptions for location data.
The Department of Homeland Security and its components acknowledged buying access to the data, but wouldn't discuss details about how they are using it in law-enforcement operations. People familiar with some of the efforts say it is used to generate investigative leads about possible illegal border crossings and for detecting or tracking migrant groups.
CBP has said it has privacy protections and limits on how it uses the location information. The agency says that it accesses only a small amount of the location data and that the data it does use is anonymized to protect the privacy of Americans.
"While CBP is being provided access to location information, it is important to note that such information doesn't include cellular phone tower data, is not ingested in bulk and doesn't include the individual user's identity," said a CBP spokesman. Tower data from cellphone companies, which can locate a specific phone, has been singled out by the Supreme Court for extra protection.
ICE initially was given access to the data for use by its criminal investigators who track human- and drug-smuggling organizations, according to people familiar with the activity. Subsequently, the data was shared with ICE's arm that carries out deportations, one of the people said.
"We do not discuss specific law-enforcement tactics or techniques, or discuss the existence or absence of specific law-enforcement-sensitive capabilities," said ICE spokesman Bryan Cox. Mr. Cox said the agency "generally" doesn't use location data for routine deportation operations.
The data was used to detect cellphones moving through what was later discovered to be a tunnel created by drug smugglers between the U.S. and Mexico that terminated in a closed Kentucky Fried Chicken outlet on the U.S. side near San Luis, Ariz., said people with knowledge of the operation.
The data tracking contributed to the 2018 arrest of the defunct restaurant's owner, Ivan Lopez, on conspiracy charges related to the construction of the tunnel, the people said. But police records of the incident make no mention of the use of data showing cellphones crossing the border in an unusual location, attributing the case instead to a routine traffic stop.
The San Luis police department "has always worked well with other entities," including federal law enforcement, said Lt. Marco Santana, a spokesman, who declined to comment further. A CBP spokesman declined to comment. Lawyers for Mr. Lopez, who pleaded guilty, declined to comment.
Contracting records show the federal government is buying the location data from Venntel. Venntel, in turn, purchased the information from private marketing companies that sell the location data of millions of cellphones to advertisers, people familiar with the matter say.
Venntel's president, Chris Gildea, said, "We are not able to comment on behalf of our customers, and any inquiries on this contract should be directed to DHS."
The company's website says that it "supports our national interests through technological innovation, data reliability and proven results." It says it offers defense-intelligence and national-security services.
Digital marketing, a multibillion-dollar industry, uses such data to deliver, for example, an ad for a restaurant or store to a nearby consumer who is scrolling through Facebook on a phone.
Divisions of DHS, ICE and CBP have purchased licenses to use Venntel's software as part of analytical programs for border security and other law-enforcement efforts, federal records show. Separate government documents make oblique references to such data being used to track, among other things, tunnels along the border.
The data is pseudonymised—meaning that each cellphone is represented by an alphanumeric advertising identifier that isn't linked to the name of the cellphone's owner. Cellphone users can change their identifier in their phone's settings menu or limit the apps that have access to their location.
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
Should the U.S. government be permitted to track its citizens' cellphone movements without a warrant? Why or why not? Join the conversation below.
Though anonymized, such mobile location data can be used to identify and track individuals based on their real-world behavior, the New York Times reported in December.
Marketing data is widely used by the government to gather intelligence abroad, say people familiar with the matter. But those contracts are frequently classified, so the extent to which intelligence agencies are buying such data cannot be determined.
In 2018, the Supreme Court issued a landmark ruling in the case Carpenter v. United States saying that geographic location data drawn from cellphones in the U.S. is a specially protected class of information because it reveals so much about Americans. The court put limits on law enforcement's ability to obtain such data directly from cellphone companies without court supervision.
But the federal government has essentially found a workaround by purchasing location data used by marketing firms rather than going to court on a case-by-case basis. Because location data is available through numerous commercial ad exchanges, government lawyers have approved the programs and concluded that the Carpenter ruling doesn't apply.
"In this case, the government is a commercial purchaser like anybody else. Carpenter is not relevant," said Paul Rosenzweig, a former DHS official who is a resident senior fellow at the R Street Institute, a conservative and libertarian think tank that promotes free markets. "The government is just buying a widget."

Ukraine still waiting on aid from US

Texto completo: President Donald Trump’s hold on $400 million in aid for Ukraine is at the heart of the Senate impeachment trial. One of the Democratic House managers said Ukraine is still waiting on what the United States promised to send.
“The aid, although it did arrive, it took the work of some senators in this room who had to pass additional laws to make sure that the Ukrainians did not lose out on $35 million additional dollars,” said Rep. Val Demings, D-Fla., Jan. 29. “Contrary to the president’s tweet that all of the aid arrived and that it arrived ahead of schedule, that is not true. All of the aid has not arrived.”
As Demings said, Trump was wrong to say the aid was delivered ahead of time.
But we wanted to know whether Ukraine was still waiting on some amount of American support, even now.
Aid, interrupted
Demings has a point that not every dollar intended for Ukraine has been delivered.
The money was supposed to come in two pots: $250 million managed by the Pentagon for military aid and $141 million managed by the State Department.
Trump’s hold on the aid last summer sent it off the usual path. The question about what federal dollars have not yet arrived relates to defense money.
Here’s a refresher on the relevant events from 2019:
June 18: The Defense Department announced plans to provide $250 million to Ukraine.
July: Trump ordered the Defense Department money, and $141 million in State Department aid, to be frozen ahead of his July 25, 2019, call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Emails show that Pentagon and OMB staff were scrambling to freeze the aid July 24-25, and paperwork to freeze the aid was in the works before the phone call. The New York Times reported that Trump first asked about freezing the aid in June.
Aug. 12: A whistleblower filed a complaint about Trump’s phone call and related actions.
Sept. 11: Under pressure, the White House released nearly $400 million of frozen U.S. aid to Ukraine.
The White House’s reversal didn’t leave time to disburse all of the money before the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30.
On Sept. 27, 2019, Trump signed a continuing appropriations bill to extend the $250 million in Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative funds for another year.
Most of the aid was obligated, the term the federal government uses to refer to money that the government has promised to spend. But a small portion wasn’t.
Mark Sandy, an official in the Office of Management Budget, said in his House deposition that roughly $35 million had not been obligated. Without the September extension, those funds would have expired, he said.
Some of those funds were intended for lethal equipment and radars, according to a Nov. 18 letter from four Democratic senators.
About 93% of the $250 million designated for Ukraine by Congress has been obligated, said Pentagon spokeswoman Lt. Col. Carla Gleason. That means about $17 million has not yet been obligated.
Officials at the Office of Management and Budget have argued that it’s common for agencies to not fully spend their money by the end of the fiscal year, including for Ukraine aid. But the Government Accountability Office concluded that the office violated the federal Impoundment Control Act by withholding security assistance to Ukraine.
“It’s atypical that $35 million out of $250 million wouldn’t be spent by the end of the fiscal year, especially when (the Defense Department) certified that Ukraine was meeting the anti-corruption and transparency conditions outlined by Congress,” said Seamus P. Daniels, a defense budget expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.
Our ruling
Demings said “all of the aid has not arrived” to Ukraine.
The Defense Department told us that of the $250 million, about $17 million has not yet been obligated. That’s about 7%. When Trump unfroze the aid in September, that left little time until the end of the fiscal year that month. Congress passed a continuing appropriations bill so the funds could be carried over into 2020.
We rate this claim Mostly True.

He Didn't Know Kobe Bryant. But He Did. There was nobody Shane Battier respected more than his basketball adversary. 'So much of my career was tied to me being his foil and him being my foil,' he says.

Texto completo: Kobe Bryant wrote what he knew. In the book he published before his death, he wrote about Michael Jordan and LeBron James, Jerry West and Magic Johnson, the players who helped define his two decades in the NBA and, of course, himself.
He also wrote about Shane Battier.
"I never spoke to Kobe outside the arena—ever," Battier said this week. "I didn't have a relationship with him. But I knew him intimately."
Battier was the man known around the NBA as the greatest of the "Kobe Stoppers," the select group of players who were paid to defend one of the most prolific scorers the game has ever seen. He was smart enough not to call himself a Kobe Stopper, this peculiar species that Bryant delighted in humiliating, because he understood that declaring you could stop Kobe happened to be the worst strategy for actually doing so. Nobody could stop Kobe . The best you could do was slow him down. And so it became Battier's goal to be a human yellow light.
There are few players in NBA history whose value was so inextricably linked to someone else's. Battier thought of himself as Captain Ahab. Bryant was his Moby Dick.
"So much of my career was tied to me being his foil and him being my foil," he said.
Born only weeks apart, they were technically contemporaries, but it never felt that way to Battier. There was nobody he respected more than Bryant. There was also nobody who vexed him as much as Bryant.
By the time he retired in 2014, Battier had an encyclopedic understanding of almost everyone he defended—who they were, who they weren't and how he could use that information to his advantage. But there was one he could never crack. "He was the only guy," Battier said. "What Kobe represents is the absolute pinnacle of challenge in my profession."
Battier, who is now an executive with the Miami Heat, felt the death of his basketball adversary in ways that he might not have expected. He's nostalgic about their 44 games against each other—Bryant's teams went 24-20—and wistful about beers they never shared together. He's even thought about what he would've told Bryant if he ever got the chance.
"He made me feel the most alive I ever did on the basketball court," Battier said. "I knew I had to be at my absolute best. If I wasn't, I was in serious trouble. Even when I was, I was in serious trouble."
Bryant and Battier were maniacal competitors, but Battier knew he couldn't compete with Bryant physically, which meant he would have to compete with the author of a book called "The Mamba Mentality" on a psychological level.
The ingenious part of his plan was how he went about pulling it off: Battier embraced Bryant's perception of him. He wouldn't act better than he was. He would pretend to be worse. Battier insisted he was slow and unathletic and extraordinarily lucky that a basketball legend happened to keep picking the nights they were on the court together to miss an unusual percentage of his shots. He made Eeyore sound confident.
It was a wonderful idea in theory. The problem was that NBA games are played in reality.
"I saw through that tactic, understood his premeditated modesty and attacked him because of it," Bryant wrote.
"And I knew that he knew," Battier said.
"I prided myself on playing any so-called Kobe Stopper," Bryant wrote.
"I always prided myself as a guy who could get in the mind of another player," Battier said.
"Safe to say," Bryant wrote, "I had a lot of fun playing against him."
"Nothing in my life has even come close to replicating that," Battier said.
The professional rivalry between this one guy who believed he was the greatest and this other guy who purported to be terrible would become plain to see when it was highlighted on national television broadcasts and in a New York Times Magazine cover story by Michael Lewis—which added yet another layer of complexity to the curious game of cat and mouse they were playing while everyone around them was busy with a basketball game.
The first time that Battier had the misfortune of guarding Bryant was in his rookie season of 2002. He was petrified. On the bus ride to the Lakers' arena, however, Battier tried to inject himself with confidence. "How good can this guy really be?" he thought.
It turned out to be a rhetorical question.
This was the night he would make his maiden voyage to a place he called Kobe Island. He soon found himself marooned. The only person who would stop Kobe that night was Kobe himself. Bryant scored 56 points in three quarters and was too good to keep playing.
"Everyone remembers his 81-point game," Battier said. "There's no question he would've scored 80 points if he'd played the fourth quarter."
The next formative Bryant experience in Battier's life would come seven years later. By then he was on a Rockets team riding a magical 21-game winning streak with the Lakers coming to Houston one night in 2008.
It was on Bryant to stop them. It was on Battier to stop Bryant.
Battier had never known so much about this player he didn't really know. He immersed himself in data. He internalized scouting reports that were finally worth reading. He even hydrated properly. "Instead of having a second glass of wine, I usually stopped at one," Battier said. He would never feel good about guarding Bryant. But at least he could feel less bad.
All that information suggested the worst shot for Bryant was a long 2-pointer off the dribble while moving left, and Battier attempted to bait him into settling for exactly that shot. He was willing to try anything to make this happen. He even turned his own hand into a blindfold. Instead of trying to block Bryant's shots, Battier tried to block his vision.
But that wasn't the only reason he made a habit of sticking his hand over another man's eyes.
"This is one of the things I'll lament that I'll never be able to tell him over a beer," Battier said. "When I put my hand in people's faces, I didn't care if they made it or not. I really, really didn't. For a guy like Kobe, I knew he would take that as a personal affront—that that was the only way I could guard him. In truth, it probably was. I was completely fine with him trying to prove that it didn't work. That was my best-case scenario."
Bryant played 47 minutes and 4 seconds that night. Battier was on the court for all but 40 seconds of them. Bryant went 11-for-33 and the Rockets won again. Battier considers it the single greatest defensive game of his career.
He would never have the opportunity to discuss it with Bryant.
"The physical battles were what they were, but there are very few people who could understand the psychological battles," Battier said. "I don't think I could have that conversation with anybody else in the world."

Dems won't stop undermining Trump

Texto completo: Just because the Senate has acquitted President Donald Trump of charges Republicans believed never rose to the level of "high crimes and misdemeanors," don't think Democrats will raise the white flag of surrender. They (and their media allies) have only just begun.
Next is a campaign to defeat enough of the 23 Republican senators up for re-election and, if possible (it doesn't look possible, but this is February), keep President Trump from winning re-election.
Democrats have virtually no issues on which to run, except the promise of free stuff - from Elizabeth Warren's student loan forgiveness plan, which does nothing for those who struggled to pay off their student loans without assistance, to Bernie Sanders' free Medicare for All.
A new Gallup poll released last week shows how difficult it will be for Democrats.
According to Gallup, 41% of Americans "are satisfied with the way things are going in the U.S." That's the highest satisfaction level in 15 years. Seventy-two percent of Republicans are satisfied, a number likely to grow if the economy remains strong and there is stability in international affairs. Only 14% of Democrats are satisfied. That is likely, in part, because President Trump is racking up success after success without any cooperation from the other party. If Democrats had cooperated on at least some issues (other than the new trade agreement between the U.S., Canada and Mexico) they might have been able to legitimately claim some credit, but their opposition to all things Trump and their attempts to undo the results of the 2016 election leaves them out in the political cold.
What is most remarkable about this Gallup poll is that it was taken in the middle of the Senate impeachment trial and in the face of some of the most hostile media coverage any president has ever had to endure in modern times.
According to the conservative Media Research Center, which monitors the broadcast network's evening news programs, "... evening news coverage of the opening arguments of both sides, found ABC, CBS, and NBC did not live up to the standard they demanded of Republicans. They gave Democrats double the airtime and showered their arguments with mostly praise, while expressing only criticism of the President's legal team."
The New York Times and Washington Post have cast aside any cloak of fairness by going anti-Trump nonstop. Their news coverage, editorials and virtually all of their columnists are constantly looking for new ways to express opposition to and hatred of the president. One advantage for readers is that it is easier to get through those papers because they have become predictable and tiresome.
Democrats may feel good about this as they keep company with their media fellow travelers, but President Trump is newly empowered to take his case for four more years of prosperity and relative peace to the public. Every Democrat running for president would raise taxes, giving more money to Washington, which cannot constrain its spending lust under either party. As taxes rise, so would unemployment because many businesses would no longer be able to afford workers they hired during the economic boom.
Look for more investigations - perhaps additional allegations and articles of impeachment - and more "leaks" from former Trump staffers between now and the election. The only way to stop this is for Republicans to regain a House majority and maintain their majority in the Senate.
Barring an unforeseeable disaster (always a possibility), Mr. Trump is positioned to win re-election, perhaps in a landslide, which will send the left and most of the media into another deep depression.

Is it really paid family leave? Trump's push for bill in SOTU differs from most proposals on the issue

Texto completo: President Donald Trump called for paid family leave Tuesday night in the State of the Union, the first Republican president to do so. But the bill he supported does not offer what has generally been considered paid family leave.
It is a bipartisan bill, introduced in December by Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz., and Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La. And it would enable new parents to collect a portion of their future child tax credits early and receive a smaller credit for the next 10-15 years.
Here's why it's different from most paid family leave proposals.
It does not provide a new source of funding to pay parents during leave; instead, they borrow from their future selves. It covers only leaves for babies or newly adopted children under 6; it does not cover care for sick family members or to take care of personal medical problems. And it does not guarantee that a person's job is protected when taking the leave.
Supporters of the bill describe it as a partial solution and a place to start, and say it doesn't preclude Congress from pursuing more comprehensive paid leave. It has some important advantages, they say: Its sponsors are bipartisan, which is rare on this issue. It doesn't raise taxes or create a mandate for businesses, two top priorities for Republicans. It also gives parents the freedom to use the money as they see fit, whether as wage replacement while on leave or to pay for infant or adoption expenses.
"Not only is it a good solution, but it's possible in the political world we live in today," Sinema said at an American Enterprise Institute and Brookings event in September.
Since first campaigning for president, Trump has expressed support for some kind of paid parental leave, and it has been a policy goal of his daughter, Ivanka.
Until Monday, the White House had said it was keeping every plan under consideration. This is the first time it endorsed one.
Traditionally, Republicans haven't supported paid leave - voicing concern about spending on new government programs and burdening businesses. So why is a Republican administration doing so?
Politically, analysts say, it appeals to a group of voters they need: suburban women, especially those who voted for Trump in 2016 but have considered Democrats since then.
"Everyone's talking about suburban female voters because they're deciding elections," said Olivia Perez-Cubas, a spokeswoman for the Winning for Women Action Fund, a political group dedicated to electing Republican women.
Paid leave, in general, is an easy sell with voters. Families need it - 72% of mothers and 93% of fathers with children at home are in the labor force - and a large majority of voters support it. But Americans, like their elected representatives, disagree on the details, particularly how to pay for it.
There is one model of government-run paid leave that has already been successfully adopted in the United States. In eight states and the District of Columbia, paid leave has been financed by a small payroll tax increase, paid by employees and employers. This is also the model that Democrats have proposed for all Americans, in a bill called the Family Act.
The child tax credit is worth up to $2,000 per child. If the Trump-backed bill passed, the average worker with a new child could receive $5,000, and then collect $500 less in child tax credits each year for 10 years.
The Family Act has minimal GOP support, and the deal breaker is the tax increase.
"A payroll tax increase is not going to be passed into law anytime soon," Ivanka Trump said on "Face the Nation" on CBS in December.

Texto completo: Kelly Oubre Jr.'s back on Twitter. He's still with the Phoenix Suns.
All is well in the desert again.
The NBA trade deadline has come and gone Thursday with Oubre remaining a key component for the Suns (20-31) after the franchise was reportedly fielding calls from teams according to The New York Times' NBA insider Mark Stein.
The Republic learned through multiple sources Wednesday night Phoenix wasn't going to trade Oubre, who is having a career year.
Averaging 18.8 points, 6.6 rebounds and shooting 35.4% from 3, all career highs, Oubre scored a season-high 30 in Wednesday's 116-108 loss at Detroit.
After the game, Oubre addressed the trade talk.
"We're players in this game and at the end of the day, I can just play and control what I can control," said Oubre, who is in his fifth NBA season. "The higher ups are going to do what they do to help organizations get better and you just got to deal with what comes with it."
Stein reported Orlando "and others" made a pitch for Oubre, but the Suns appear to be staying intact. The Republic has learned through sources multiple teams were interested in Oubre, who Phoenix acquired in a trade last season from Washington.
The Suns also looked to make a trade for Detroit third-year guard Luke Kennard, but hit a snag with the protections on a first-round draft pick they looked to give the Pistons.
Jevon Carter and Elie Okobo were reportedly part of the deal, but Phoenix, as of the 1 p.m. Arizona time deadline, hadn't made a deal.
So the Suns appear to be moving forward with an injury-filled roster that's six games out of the eight and final playoff spot in the Western Conference held by Memphis.
Oubre's value is high because he's a very talented 24-year-old who only signed a two-year deal with the Suns. So Phoenix may be in this position again right before the next trade deadline, or earlier, with teams showing interest in Oubre.

Texto completo: More than a hundred models, including Amber Valletta and Christy Turlington, have signed an open letter to the boss of Victoria's Secret demanding an end to alleged misconduct at the lingerie leader.
The letter, published by the nonprofit group The Model Alliance, blasted the company for failing to take "concrete action to change its culture of misogyny" after complaints and a meeting five months ago.
Citing an investigative piece in The New York Times last weekend titled " 'Angels' in Hell: The Culture of Misogyny Inside Victoria's Secret," the letter said the firm's misconduct "is even more egregious and more entrenched than previously understood."
"We believe that this moment can be a wakeup call for Victoria's Secret," the letter said.
It urged CEO John Mehas to enlist his company as the latest member of Model Alliance's respect program.
Members follow a code of conduct and agree to abide by a "confidential complaint mechanism" promising "swift and fair resolution of complaints and appropriate consequences for abusers," the letter said.
Model Andi Muise signed the letter this week after she told the Times she was harassed by former Victoria's Secret boss Ed Razek, 71, who stepped down in August.
She said Razek invited her to dinner in 2007 when she was 19 years old and tried to kiss her on the way to the restaurant.
Muise said Razek pelted her with creepy come-ons, suggesting they move in together in his house in Turks and Caicos or find a different home to share in the Dominican Republic.
"I need someplace sexy to take you," he wrote in one email reviewed by the Times.
Muise said she politely rebuffed his advances and later learned she was not picked to walk in the 2008 Victoria's Secret fashion show after getting the gig the previous three years.
Attempts to reach a spokespokesman for the company were not successful Thursday.
According to the Times, Razek also personally supervised a 2018 lingerie fitting for supermodel Bella Hadid and commented on her "perfect" breasts.
At the same fitting, Mr. Razek placed his hand on a different model's underwear-clad crotch, three people reportedly told the newspaper.
Razek denied the allegations, calling them "categorically untrue, misconstrued or taken out of context" in a response to the Times.
"It's time for Victoria's Secret to take action to protect the people they profit from," the Model Alliance letter said. "Human rights violations can't be stopped with a corporate rebranding exercise."

Texto completo: Four days before Iowa Democrats stumbled into futility, Bernie Sanders revealed to The New York Times the genesis of his socialism. Never mind the gulags, famines, Venezuelas and other wreckages, socialism is justified because the Dodgers decamped from Brooklyn to Los Angeles after the 1957 season when Sanders was 16. The Times says "perhaps no single event has proved more enduring in Mr. Sanders's consciousness -- more viscerally felt in his signature fury toward the 1%." Well.
In 1955, the Dodgers, with six future Hall of Famers, won the World Series but had an average attendance of just 13,423, barely better than MLB's worst-drawing 2019 team (Miami, 10,016). ... In Sanders' cartoonish understanding of reality, his explanation of everything he finds objectionable -- other people's "greed" -- explains the loss of what he still considers his eternal entitlement to the Dodgers being in Brooklyn.
Never mind that many of the Dodgers' fans left Brooklyn, as did today's senator from Vermont who, by the way, when playing a like-minded rabbi for a film, said that he despises "free agency crap" -- the unionized players' hard-won right to negotiate terms of employment with teams of their choice.
Substituting indignation for information, Sanders's baseball nostalgia is akin to his claim that the average worker "is not making a nickel more" than 45 years ago. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office says that from 1990 to 2016 the average household's inflation-adjusted income after taxes and government transfers increased 46%, and 66% for households in the bottom quintile.

It's not your father's XFL

Texto completo: It was a professional football league that lasted for one season 19 years ago, but memories of the XFL are surprisingly vivid for fans over 30: He Hate Me, Jesse Ventura, no fair catches, the Memphis Maniax.
So when the XFL returns this weekend with a new eight-team league, again owned by Vince McMahon of World Wrestling Entertainment, can fans expect more of the same?
The answer, Commissioner Oliver Luck said, is no: "Aside from the name, there is nothing in common that we will have with the league in 2001."
Rather than razzle-dazzle or ratings-grabbing stunts, "we are focusing 100% on the quality of play," he said.
The old XFL celebrated its edginess, even promising glimpses into the cheerleaders' locker rooms. "We are gimmick-free," the new league president, Jeffrey Pollack, said. "And we don't even have cheerleaders."
The league has landed every one of its games on television, on ABC, ESPN, Fox and FS1 and 2, as well as on Spanish-language stations. And the newfound mellowness extends to its announcers. While broadcasts in 2001 featured the colorful likes of Ventura, Brian Bosworth and Jerry "The King" Lawler, the lead play-by-play man for XFL 2020 will be a reliable pro, Steve Levy.
Even the most memorable aspect of the old league has been scrapped. Players' jerseys will have plain old last names, rather than nicknames such as He Hate Me (Rod Smart) and Death Blow (Jamal Duff).
The team nicknames have similarly been tempered, with extreme names such as, well, the Los Angeles Xtreme and the Maniax (which drew the ire of some mental health advocates) giving way to the more conventional Dallas Renegades and Los Angeles Wildcats.
Pollack acknowledged that despite the XFL abandoning many of its former distinctive features, the old league does buy some good will for the new. "We're launching a 100-year brand that also has 20 years of equity built in."
To the extent that the new league is pushing the football envelope, it comes in several unusual rules innovations.
For one, kickoffs will be dramatically different in the new XFL. The kicker will boot the ball from his team's 25-yard line, but he will be a lonely figure. His 10 teammates will be lined up 40 yards away at the opposing team's 35. The returning team will be at its 30. Only once the ball is caught by the returner will players on either side be allowed to move. "It's effectively a play from scrimmage," Luck said.
The league has been testing the new kickoff and expects to see more kickoff runbacks, exciting plays that have been dying out in football, but without the injuries that are often caused by large men colliding after a 35- to 40-yard sprint.
(This concern for safety is another departure from the original XFL, which billed itself as manly football: It did not allow fair catches, for example. The new league emphasizes that it sought good football players who were also of good character.)
The league also has added a strategic decision that might prove intriguing. After a touchdown, teams cannot attempt an extra-point kick. They can go for a single point with a play from scrimmage at the 2-yard line, or go for 2 points from the 5-yard line. They can even go for 3 with a play from the 10. Effectively, the rule makes a 9-point game a one-score game.
Should a game go to overtime, it will end with a contest that operates much like a soccer or hockey shootout. Each team will get five tries to score from the 5-yard line. Whichever team scores more times wins the game. "Let's have the position players decide overtime," said Luck, the father of retired Colts quarterback Andrew Luck.
The league said it wanted to avoid one team getting the ball, scoring and immediately ending the game. But at the same time, it wanted an overtime that would wrap up in seven or eight minutes.
The league, which will play a 10-week season followed by a four-team playoff ending in late April, has opted for big stadiums for its games, including CenturyLink Field, home of the Seattle Seahawks; Raymond James Stadium, home of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers; and MetLife Stadium, where the Giants and Jets play.
Despite the danger of having some empty seats, Pollack said: "We're playing in eight cities that have a love of football. We want to be in big markets with world-class venues."
Because of the NFL, of course, world-class names are in much shorter supply.
Hard-core fans might recognize quarterbacks like Landry Jones (Dallas Renegades), Matt McGlouin (New York Guardians) and Cardale Jones (D.C. Defenders). But other unemployed players who might have joined the league, fancifully or not, such as Johnny Manziel, Colin Kaepernick, Chad Johnson and Tim Tebow, are absent.
Star power was not a major consideration, the league said. "Our goal was to get the best players who want to play in our league," Luck said. "We think we've got the best 400 or so players that aren't under contract elsewhere."
Unlike the NFL, the new league will allow its broadcaster to talk about point spreads. "A lot of fans enjoy gaming, playing fantasy, placing legal bets," Pollack said. "We want to support all of that activity. We see it as a way of increasing fan engagement."
Though none of the teams has played a game, bookmakers already have opinions. In three of the four opening games, the home team is favored, as might be expected.
The exception is the New York team, which is a 2 1/2-point underdog at home to the Tampa Bay Vipers. Perhaps some mojo from the recent-vintage Jets and Giants is rubbing off.
Numerous other professional leagues have been started and have failed in recent years (all were men's leagues; women do play football, but a high-profile investment in a women's league is still awaited). Why does the new XFL think it will be different?
Pollack spoke of a "100-year brand," but will the league even surpass the United Football League (four seasons), the Fall Experimental Football League (two seasons) or the Alliance of American Football (less than a season, just last year)?
Luck said it would, because "the caliber of play is better than any previous league." Pollack cited two years of research and development, every game being on TV and "ownership that is dedicated to long-term brand building."
But he admitted the league was taking nothing for granted: "It's going to take time to build the XFL. Fandom is earned, not given."

Texto completo: President Donald Trump called for paid family leave Tuesday night in the State of the Union, the first Republican president to do so. But the bill he supported does not offer what has generally been considered paid family leave.
It is a bipartisan bill, introduced in December by Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz., and Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La. And it would enable new parents to collect a portion of their future child tax credits early and receive a smaller credit for the next 10-15 years.
Here's why it's different from most paid family leave proposals.
It does not provide a new source of funding to pay parents during leave; instead, they borrow from their future selves. It covers only leaves for babies or newly adopted children under 6; it does not cover care for sick family members or to take care of personal medical problems. And it does not guarantee that a person's job is protected when taking the leave.
Supporters of the bill describe it as a partial solution and a place to start, and say it doesn't preclude Congress from pursuing more comprehensive paid leave. It has some important advantages, they say: Its sponsors are bipartisan, which is rare on this issue. It doesn't raise taxes or create a mandate for businesses, two top priorities for Republicans. It also gives parents the freedom to use the money as they see fit, whether as wage replacement while on leave or to pay for infant or adoption expenses.
"Not only is it a good solution, but it's possible in the political world we live in today," Sinema said at an American Enterprise Institute and Brookings event in September.
Since first campaigning for president, Trump has expressed support for some kind of paid parental leave, and it has been a policy goal of his daughter, Ivanka.
Until Monday, the White House had said it was keeping every plan under consideration. This is the first time it endorsed one.
Traditionally, Republicans haven't supported paid leave -- voicing concern about spending on new government programs and burdening businesses. So why is a Republican administration doing so?
Politically, analysts say, it appeals to a group of voters they need: suburban women, especially those who voted for Trump in 2016 but have considered Democrats since then.
"Everyone's talking about suburban female voters because they're deciding elections," said Olivia Perez-Cubas, a spokeswoman for the Winning for Women Action Fund, a political group dedicated to electing Republican women.
Paid leave, in general, is an easy sell with voters. Families need it -- 72% of mothers and 93% of fathers with children at home are in the labor force -- and a large majority of voters support it. But Americans, like their elected representatives, disagree on the details, particularly how to pay for it.
There is one model of government-run paid leave that has already been successfully adopted in the United States. In eight states and the District of Columbia, paid leave has been financed by a small payroll tax increase, paid by employees and employers. This is also the model that Democrats have proposed for all Americans, in a bill called the Family Act.
The child tax credit is worth up to $2,000 per child. If the Trump-backed bill passed, the average worker with a new child could receive $5,000, and then collect $500 less in child tax credits each year for 10 years.
The Family Act has minimal GOP support, and the deal breaker is the tax increase.
"A payroll tax increase is not going to be passed into law anytime soon," Ivanka Trump said on "Face the Nation" on CBS in December.

Texto completo: A public memorial service for Kobe Bryant, his daughter and seven others killed in a helicopter crash is planned for Feb. 24 at Staples Center, The Los Angeles Times reported Thursday.
The arena is where Bryant starred for the Lakers for two decades and the date 2/24 corresponds with the No. 24 jersey he wore and the No. 2 worn by his 13-year-old daughter, Gianna.
Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti has said a memorial would be held but his office had no other immediate comment.
Bryant was killed Jan. 26 when the helicopter carrying him, his daughter and the others crashed into a mountainside in Calabasas while flying to a girls basketball tournament at his Mamba Sports Academy. Gianna's team was coached by Bryant and was playing in the tournament.
No cause for the crash has been determined, though a preliminary report by the National Transportation Safety Board is expected soon.
A game between the Clippers and the Grizzlies is scheduled for Feb. 24 at 7:30 p.m. at Staples.
Knicks to hire agent as team boss: Leon Rose, an NBA agent at Creative Artists Agency, will take over as Knicks team president, The New York Times reported. While Rose doesn't have experience in basketball operations, he has a deep well of connections to star players, including Carmelo Anthony and LeBron James, in his decades as an agent.
The Knicks moved swiftly to replace Steve Mills, who the team announced was leaving his post Tuesday.
Rose, a native of Cherry Hill, New Jersey who played basketball at Dickinson College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania and graduated from Temple law school in 1986, represented the likes of Allen Iverson, Richard Hamilton and LeBron James.
The Knicks last won the NBA championship in 1973.
All-Star captains make picks: LeBron James selected Lakers teammate Anthony Davis with the first pick in the All-Star player draft for the annual game Feb. 16 in Chicago.
Opposing captain Giannis Antetokounmpo of the Bucks took 76ers big man Joel Embiid with the second pick.

Weinstein was a moment of change for director

Texto completo: Trained in documentaries, her hypnotic feature debut "The Assistant," about to open in theaters, the Australian writer-director Kitty Greenremembers where she was when it happened.
"It" was Oscar-winning film production mogul Harvey Weinstein, whose infamy came with the first of many carefully researched New York Times investigations into his serial sexual predation. In the fall of 2017, Green, now 35, was on the campus of Stanford University, one stop in her fact-finding tour of colleges across America. She'd begun gathering interviews with students for a project about the nature of consent and sexual power structures. Suddenly, that day in October, her phone imploded with texts and emails about the Weinstein scandal.
"A few of my friends had worked at the Weinstein Company," Green told an audience Tuesday night at the female co-share workspace The Wing in Chicago's Fulton Market district, following a screening of "The Assistant."
Other friends, she said, "had worked with similar kinds of men, around similar behavior patterns. So I started to wonder what kind of environments supported that sort of behavior." She began talking to women who worked for and around Weinstein. She met with women from other production companies, agencies, women in finance, the tech industry.
"I was hearing the same stories again and again about gendered division of labor, this idea that women get the coffee and men get to sit in the meetings. Those stories kept coming up, again and again and again." So Green embarked on a screenplay, not about Weinstein specifically -- in the finished film, the predatory boss has no name and is never seen on screen -- but a story of "one day in the life of this person with the least power at a very powerful organization."
A few minutes later she joked that the film she made her way, starring Julia Garner as the title character navigating a grimly typical workday in an eerily claustrophobic Manhattan office, doesn't "make it easy on anybody. It's about the banality of evil." Pause. "Unfortunately for you guys." The crowd laughs. Green acknowledges that "The Assistant" is a fundamentally "pessimistic" movie, adding: "I promise the next one will be a comedy."
In person, the filmmaker's self-deprecating wit can deceive people. Any minute of footage from any of her movies, such as the 2017 nonfiction essay "Casting JonBenet" (about the murder of the preteen pageant competitor), reveals a precise, compositionally dynamic eye. Any minute reveals an ability to create movement and tension, through subterranean tonal shifts, within a fixed camera shot. Green's parents met in art school; her mother is a photographer, and her father is currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Hegelian dialectics.
"So that's where it comes from, I guess," she says, grinning.
"The Assistant" relies heavily on its protagonist's reactions to others' actions. In Garner, Green found the ideal collaborator. Best known for her work on "Ozark," "The Americans" and "Dirty John," the actress fit the description Green shared with her casting director. "I needed someone infinitely watchable," Green told me after the panel. Shooting the film, she says, working closely with Garner, "I kept thinking: Is it always this good? Or did I just luck out the first time, working with such a great actress?"
Green, a native of Melbourne, studied film and television at the Victorian College of the Arts and established her skills as director, cinematographer and editor with the documentary "Ukraine Is Not a Brothel" (2013), about the topless feminist protest movement known as Femen. Her work draws connections between sexual exploitation and female agency, and "The Assistant" is a singular procedural. We won't know if it's a period piece, a pre-Weinstein silent scream, until a few years of progress have been made.
With "The Assistant," she premiered last summer at the Telluride Film Festival and picked up a distribution deal with Bleeker Street prior to the Sundance festival in January.
The festival circuit, the pre- and post-screening discussions -- these can do a number on a female filmmaker's confidence. Green made "The Assistant," she says now, partly "because I was getting fed up with the way I was being treated at film festivals. That really was my own way into the subject."
A typical question from a male journalist following a screening of "Casting JonBenet," she recalls, dealt with which one of Green's male producers gave her the idea for the movie. (Answer: Neither. The idea was hers.)
On the "The Assistant" national press tour, she says, a few male journalists have taken one look at her and then told the publicist that they won't be needing the full 20 minutes. "It messes with your self-confidence," she says, briskly. "I suppose it takes a minute or two for people to figure out I'm not a complete waste of their time."
Her movie, she says, is built on microaggressions, as Garner's character realizes the extent of the complicity in her workplace. Moviegoers trained to expect a conventional table-turning moment, a gratifying catharsis, are better off streaming "Bombshell."
This one, Green hopes, "is about something bigger" than the unnamed, unseen executive and his behavior.
"I wanted to stay focused on the other side of the door," she says.
"The Assistant" opens Friday.

Texto completo: Harriet Frank Jr., who collaborated with her husband, Irving Ravetch, on provocative screenplays that explored the social conflicts and moral questions of postwar American life in movies like "Hud" and "Norma Rae," died Jan. 28 at her home in Los Angeles. She was 96.
Her death was announced by Michael Frank, her nephew.
To film industry peers and moviegoers who paid attention to the credits, the wife-and-husband team of Harriet Frank and Ravetch, who died in 2010, stood out among Hollywood's most successful and literate script writers. The two generated 16 screenplays from 1958 to 1990, many inspired by the works of William Faulkner, William Inge, Larry McMurtry, Elmore Leonard and other best-selling authors.
Frank and Ravetch dramatized the charms of a brawling, arrogant Texas rogue (Paul Newman) in "Hud" (1963); the struggles of a teacher (Jon Voight) against the effects of poverty and racism on black children in a South Carolina island school in "Conrack" (1974); and the union fight of a worker (Sally Field) against labor injustices in a North Carolina cotton mill in "Norma Rae" (1979).
"Salvation is not an abstract concept -- it's a three-year contract," Vincent Canby wrote in his review of "Norma Rae" in The New York Times. "These are sentiments that Martin Ritt, the director, and Irving Ravetch and Harriet Frank Jr., his screenwriters, understand and fervently evoke in their often stirring new film."
The moment of truth in the actual battle for a union took place in a J.P. Stevens textile mill in Roanoke Rapids, North Carolina, in May 1973, when Crystal Lee Sutton (her married name at the time was Jordan), who was about to be forcibly removed by management men, stood up on her worktable with a scrawled "UNION" sign and slowly turned to show fellow workers. One by one, the roaring mill machines shut down until the vast room was silent.
"Norma Rae," based on Henry P. Leifermann's 1975 book, "Crystal Lee, a Woman of Inheritance," and "Hud," from the 1961 McMurtry novel "Horseman, Pass By," together won five Academy Awards. Both Frank-Ravetch screenplay adaptations were nominated for Academy Awards. For "Hud," they won screenwriting awards from the New York Film Critics Circle and the Writers Guild of America. (They never won an Oscar.)
Although not a major commercial success or an award winner, "Conrack," adapted from Pat Conroy's autobiographical novel, "The Water Is Wide" (1972), was a memorable portrayal of a young teacher's struggle to bring hope to the children of poor black families on an isolated sea island where the Gullah dialect rendered his name as Conrack and where fears of the outside world seemed insuperable.
Collaborative page-to-screen adaptations are opaque to the public, and often hard to achieve, given the complexities of reducing a book to two hours of plot, character and dialogue. But Frank and Ravetch were nearly ideal partners. They debated every scene and sentence, took liberally or lightly from source materials, and wrote screenplays that were largely works of their own invention.
"It's really a pure collaboration in the sense that we get together, we talk out the problems at great exhaustive length, we do some kind of an outline together, and every word is really thrown up in the air for approval -- from one to the other," Ravetch told Patrick McGilligan for his book "Backstory 3: Interviews With Screenwriters of the 60s" (1997). "The script is not so much written as it is talked onto the page."
They knew and loved books. They adored the films of Ettore Scola, Vittorio De Sica, Marcel Pagnol and Ingmar Bergman. They believed character was more important than plot, wrote pauses into the action to let audiences linger over ambiguities and poignancy, and thought that scripts should aspire to literature and that films should carry the weight of novels.
They met as young writers in training at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, were married in 1946 and wrote westerns and light comedies separately for a decade before they began to collaborate. Once they started, their focus shifted to more ambitious projects, exploring moral issues and unfolding social changes.
Studios like 20th Century Fox and Paramount recognized their talents and gave them wide latitude to alter books and articles whose rights the studios had purchased. Thus Hud, a minor character in McMurtry's novel, became the film's title character and dominant anti-hero, a symbol of the rapacious greed and materialism that the screenwriters saw spreading in America.
Frank and Ravetch took similar liberties with three stories by Faulkner that were condensed into "The Long, Hot Summer" (1958), with Newman playing an unscrupulous and ambitious drifter who stirs up family passions and trouble in a Mississippi town. "Possibly 10 percent of Faulkner is in that movie," Ravetch told McGilligan.
"Faulkner was uniquely gifted," Frank added, perhaps assuaging the guilt. "Also, because he had been a screenwriter himself, he was a very tolerant man where other writers were concerned. He knew what laboring in the field was like. He was very realistic about letting go of his work."
Harriet Frank was born Harriet Goldstein in Portland, Oregon, on March 2, 1923, one of three children of Sam Goldstein, a shoe store owner, and Edith Frances (Bergman) Goldstein, who went by her middle name. Harriet and her brothers, Peter and Marty, attended schools in Portland.
Harriet's mother, a Berkeley-educated lover of literature, had a Portland radio program, "Harriet Frank -- Speaking Frankly." She not only changed the family name to Frank; she also changed her own given name to that of her daughter, becoming Harriet Frank Sr., and making her teenage daughter Harriet Frank Jr.
The family moved to Los Angeles in 1939. Harriet Frank Sr. became a story editor for MGM, reading books and advising which ones, or which parts, might make good movies. Harriet Frank Jr. and Ravetch both attended the University of California, Los Angeles, but graduated in different years and did not know each other there.
With her mother's help, Frank was hired as a screenwriter trainee at MGM, where she met Ravetch. They married and discovered on returning from their honeymoon that they had been fired. They went to Warner Bros., where he became a screenwriter and she wrote dialogue for romances and westerns.
In addition to screenwriting, Frank wrote scores of stories for The Saturday Evening Post, Collier's and other magazines, and two novels: "Single" (1977), about four women finding and losing love, and "Special Effects" (1979), about a movie studio story editor who keeps her equilibrium when all those around her are falling apart.
Frank, who lived in Laurel Canyon in the Hollywood Hills, is survived by a brother, Marty.

Texto completo: It seemed, to some at least, a perfectly reasonable event to include in a series of centenaries planned for the Irish War of Independence from 1919 to 1921: a commemoration of Royal Irish Constabulary police officers who fought and died on the British side.
But the public outcry that greeted the event's announcement last month not only forced its cancellation but may have damaged the government's chance of retaining power in a general election Saturday.
Beyond its immediate effect, the dispute served notice that in celebrating the centenary, the government is venturing into a minefield that could open old wounds rather than heal them.
Opposition politicians accused Prime Minister Leo Varadkar's Fine Gael party of suggesting a moral equivalence between members of the Irish Republican Army, who fought for Irish independence, and police officers who died defending British rule.
That anger was amplified by the discovery that the 563 officers being officially commemorated would include -- whether or not the government had realized it -- not only Irish-born members of the Royal Irish Constabulary and Dublin Metropolitan Police but also members of the "Black and Tans" and the Auxiliary Division. These mainly British ex-soldiers were recruited as special wartime reinforcements and became notorious for mass reprisals and indiscriminate killings of Irish people.
"It is shocking to many to commemorate a force that aided the colonial power and the Black and Tans," read one typical Tweet on the subject. "The French don't commemorate Vichy!" it added, comparing the officers to the French government that collaborated with the Nazis.
Whoever wins the election will be in place to oversee the sensitive task of commemorating the centenaries of many of the most bloody and divisive episodes in Ireland's modern history.
As part of a "Decade of Centenaries" of key dates surrounding Irish independence, the Dublin government has navigated several potentially sensitive commemorations, including the Easter Rising of 1916, which set off armed rebellion, the election of Ireland's first pro-independence Parliament in 1918 and the first fatal shots in the War of Independence the next year.
There are more lying ahead, including the Bloody Sunday massacre of November 1920 and the partition of Ireland in 1921.
Ireland's new government will have to navigate all of this at a time when relations with Britain have been strained by the Brexit process -- including the delicate question of how to handle the border with Northern Ireland, a territory that remains under British control and now out of the European Union after Brexit.
"A lot of what has happened in the last three years has brought out militancy in people who thought they were quite moderate nationalists," said Diarmaid Ferriter, a history professor at University College Dublin. "Three years of listening to the debate about the border, and to British ignorance about Ireland, have allowed a reflex anti-British sentiment to come to the fore."
Henry Patterson, an emeritus professor of history at the University of Ulster in Northern Ireland, said the dispute over the RIC threatened to feed into destructive sectarian passions.
"If you can't recognize the humanity of these people and what was done to them as well as what they did to other people," Patterson said, "we are really into the worst kind of tribal narrative about Irish history."
The current backlash erupted at a time when many people south of the border had been gaining a more nuanced understanding of the old RIC.
Founded as a heavily armed colonial police force, it was expected to protect Anglo Irish landlords from their impoverished Irish tenants, oversee evictions and quell political unrest. But in quieter times its constables earned acceptance and even respect through ordinary police work.
Most of its rank-and-file members were recruited from the same class of Catholic farmers and merchants who provided the bedrock for Ireland's struggle for independence.
In the War of Independence, thousands of these Irish-born RIC officers -- isolated and ostracized, threatened with death and often divided in their loyalties -- either resigned, left the country or threw in their lot with the rebels.
As it led the military fight for independence, the Irish Republican Army -- which committed plenty of atrocities of its own -- was ruthless toward those officers and their families. Eunan O'Halpin, a history professor at Trinity College Dublin, said that by his count 452 RIC members of all types, including Black and Tans and Auxiliaries, lost their lives.
"Some were off-duty, some were unarmed, and many were killed after capture," he said.
Kevin McCarthy, an American writer who lives in Ireland, said he saw similarities to Iraqi police officers who continued to serve after the United States invaded their country in 2003. That dynamic was partly what inspired his 2010 novel, "Peeler," about a conscientious RIC sergeant investigating a string of nonpolitical murders that occurred during the War of Independence.
"I saw a documentary about the Iraqi police after the U.S. invasion, how they had to attend at the scene while Marines were kicking in doors, and afterwards they'd be targeted because they were locals and had to live there," McCarthy said. "The parallels really struck me."
He said he was surprised when, after a public reading of the book at a festival in West Cork, the setting of his novel, four older people came up to talk with him about its subject matter. "They were saying to me, 'My father was in the RIC, and I could never talk to anybody about it until now.' "

Texto completo: A public memorial service for Kobe Bryant, his daughter and seven others killed in a helicopter crash is planned for Feb. 24 at Staples Center, The Los Angeles Times reported Thursday.
The arena is where Bryant starred for the Lakers for two decades and the date 2/24 corresponds with the No. 24 jersey he wore and the No. 2 worn by his 13-year-old daughter, Gianna.
Bryant was killed Jan. 26 when the helicopter carrying him, his daughter and the others crashed into a mountainside in Calabasas while flying to a girls basketball tournament at his Mamba Sports Academy. Gianna's team was coached by Bryant and was playing in the tournament.
A game between the Clippers and the Grizzlies is scheduled for Feb. 24 at 7:30 p.m. at Staples.
Knicks to hire agent as team boss: Leon Rose, an NBA agent at Creative Artists Agency, will take over as Knicks team president, The New York Times reported. While Rose doesn't have experience in basketball operations, he has a deep well of connections to star players, including Carmelo Anthony and LeBron James, in his decades as an agent.
The Knicks moved swiftly to replace Steve Mills, who the team announced was leaving his post Tuesday.
Rose, a native of Cherry Hill, N.J., represented the likes of Allen Iverson, Richard Hamilton and LeBron James.
Layups: Giannis Antetokounmpo scored 36 points and grabbed 20 boards, and the Bucks beat the visiting 76ers 112-101. Antetokounmpo had 30-plus points and 15-plus rebounds for the fifth straight game and the 14th time this season as the Bucks won for the 12th time in 13 games. ... Despite playing with a sprained toe, Zion Williamson scored 21 points to help the host Pelicans beat the Bulls 125-119. It was the Bulls' fourth loss in a row. ... Julius Randle scored 22 points, and the Knicks rallied from 10 down in the fourth to beat the visiting Magic 105-103 for their third straight win. ... LeBron James selected Lakers teammate Anthony Davis with the first pick in the All-Star player draft for the Feb. 16 game in Chicago. Antetokounmpo, the other captain, took 76ers big man Joel Embiid with the second pick.

Caucus results data yield inconsistencies

Texto completo: As the Iowa Democratic Party struggles to report full results of the 2020 Iowa caucuses, caucusgoers, campaigns and journalists have found inconsistencies and errors in the data released.
The Des Moines Register found discrepancies between official precinct-level worksheets and what the Democratic Party posted in results.
The Register analysis also found potential errors in how delegates were awarded, given the numbers the party reported. The potential errors in delegate awards show some Democratic presidential candidates receiving more delegates from a given precinct than other candidates who actually had more supporters counted.
The Iowa Democratic Party on Wednesday acknowledged some of the errors in its data and corrected them. Others errors appeared to still linger on Thursday, according to the Register analysis.
James Payne, a 33-year-old journalist, flew from New York City to volunteer for U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders' campaign in Iowa ahead of the caucuses. After a week of canvassing and training, Payne helped a local precinct captain convince caucusgoers to join the Sanders camp in Des Moines' 14th Precinct on Monday night.
Sanders and former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg were each awarded two delegates at the end of the night, Payne recalled. U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren received one. Former Vice President Joe Biden also received one.
"It was my first caucus. It was such a rush and we did extremely well in the white, working-class neighborhood," Payne said in a Thursday interview. "I'm very happy with the results that we had."
But in the Iowa Democratic Party's data, Sanders had 50 supporters counted in the final alignment; Buttigieg had 52; Warren had 31; and Biden had 25. Both Biden and Sanders were awarded 0.2798 and Warren and Buttigieg had 0.5596, meaning Warren received more delegate strength from a precinct in which Sanders actually had more supporters.
"I just got back to New York, the first thing that happened when I touched down... is I saw this," Payne said. "Then, I tweeted about it."
After Payne tweeted about what he saw, a fellow Twitter user messaged him with a coding script to check for more potential errors. The script highlighted nine other precincts in which a candidate with more support did not earn as many state delegate equivalents as other candidates who received less support. The Register confirmed those issues in its own analysis.
Isaiah Zirkelbach, a 25-year-old from Clinton, saw similar errors in the Clinton 2-1 Precinct.
In the Iowa Democrats' official results, Sanders had 26 supporters in the first round of preference support, more than any other candidate. In the second round, the Vermont senator had only 20 supporters counted.
The Democrats' rules, however, say that candidates who are viable, as Sanders was after the first count, should not lose support in the second round. The rules say that viable candidates' support is locked in after first round counting.
That means Sanders should have had, at minimum, 26 people in the final count.
"I don't know if these people were removed, or if this was just straight incompetence," Zirkelbach said in an interview. The precinct-level data from that precinct appear to show other inconsistencies in counting.
"There's obviously been widespread issues with reporting, but I hadn't seen this specific scenario yet," Zirkelbach said. "What I'm thinking is that, in this specific case, they maybe didn't know about the rule change or didn't follow it."
The Register also sent an email to the Iowa Democratic Party's media address asking about numbers it reported for Clinton County's Liberty Toronto Precinct. In that precinct, Buttigieg and Sanders appeared to have more supporters than U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar but only Klobuchar received delegates.
Mandy McClure, a spokeswoman for the Iowa Democratic Party, acknowledged the error but did not provide an explanation.
Sanders called out mathematical errors in the caucus reporting during a speech in New Hampshire on Thursday.
"I think what has happened with the Iowa Democratic Party is an outrage," Sanders said. "That they were that unprepared, that they put forth such a complicated process, relied on untested technology, and also, to be honest with you, they have relied on thousands of volunteers — good people, who then have to get up and go to work the next day — to do what is enormously complicated."
In data from Des Moines' 55th Precinct, the Iowa Democratic Party corrected errors on Wednesday that showed former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick receiving 191 supporters in the first alignment and 218 in the final.
Those supporter figures were re-allocated to Sanders, where they belonged, according to a Register photograph of the precinct worksheet. Warren's supporter strength had been mistakenly allocated to Tom Steyer.
While the party's Wednesday afternoon update corrected those errors, on Thursday entrepreneur Andrew Yang and "uncommitted" were both shown as having no support in either round of counting. According to the caucus-night worksheet, Yang had 65 supporters in the first round of counting and "uncommitted" had support in both alignments.
A New York Times report Thursday highlighted other potential problems in the party's reporting. That analysis found "more than 100 precincts reported results that were internally inconsistent, that were missing data or that were not possible under the complex rules of the Iowa caucuses."
"The caucus math work sheet is the official report on caucus night to the I.D.P., and the I.D.P. reports the results as delivered by the precinct chair," McClure told the New York Times. "This form must be signed by the caucus chair, the caucus secretary and representatives from each campaign in the room who attest to its accuracy. Under the rules of the delegate selection process, delegates are awarded based off the record of results as provided by each precinct caucus chair."

Ohio senators Portman, Brown speak for a polarized nation

Texto completo: For the 5 million subscribers to the New York Times, Ohio's two senators – one a Republican, the other a Democrat – spoke for a divided U.S. Senate and a divided nation. Over the last two days, in dueling op-eds, GOP Sen. Rob Portman of Terrace Park and Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown of Cleveland presented their arguments for acquitting and convicting President Donald Trump in his impeachment trial.
Trump was acquitted Wednesday.
The two veteran politicians showcased the polarized views of the nation – though they did agree on some things.
In his op-ed, as in his floor speech and statements to Ohio reporters, Portman – unlike some Republican senators – acknowledged Trump had done what he's accused of: He used the threat of withholding foreign aid to Ukraine as a way to extort an investigation into his political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden.
That was "improper," Portman wrote, but not bad enough to remove a president from office. He wrote:
The founders intended for impeachment to be extremely rare, and they required those seeking to remove the president to meet the burden of proving "high crimes and misdemeanors," like treason or bribery. In this case, unlike in other impeachments, no crime was alleged. Although there may be circumstances where a crime isn't necessary for a president to be impeached, to be impeached under such a circumstance would require meeting an even higher bar, and it wasn't met here.
In addition, the House engaged in a rushed process that lacked fundamental fairness. The constitutional law professor Jonathan Turley calls it "the shortest proceeding, with the thinnest evidentiary record, and the narrowest grounds ever used to impeach a president." It was also the only purely partisan impeachment in history.
In Brown's op-ed, as in his floor speech and statements to Ohio reporters, he argued that Trump's actions were far worse than those of even President Richard Nixon, who resigned in the face of a likely impeachment.
And, he argued, Republicans knew it but they were simply afraid of Trump – of his nicknames, his tweets, his allies at Fox News and talk radio. He wrote:
There's an old Russian proverb: The tallest blade of grass is the first cut by the scythe. In private, many of my colleagues agree that the president is reckless and unfit. They admit his lies. And they acknowledge what he did was wrong. They know this president has done things Richard Nixon never did. And they know that more damning evidence is likely to come out.
So watching the mental contortions they perform to justify their votes is painful to behold: They claim that calling witnesses would have meant a never-ending trial. They tell us they've made up their minds, so why would we need new evidence? They say to convict this president now would lead to the impeachment of every future president – as if every president will try to sell our national security to the highest bidder.
I have asked some of them, "If the Senate votes to acquit, what will you do to keep this president from getting worse?" Their responses have been shrugs and sheepish looks.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – In the middle of an impeachment trial, a confident Donald Trump gathered two dozen Republican senators on the South Lawn of the White House for an unlikely celebration.
INSIDE ON PAGE 3A
The monthslong impeachment inquiry and trial opened a revealing window into the Trump White House. Find out what we learned – and didn't learn.
Mitt Romney's new life as the sole GOP senator who voted to convict.
Touting the completion of his trade deal with Mexico and Canada, Trump called out the senators one by one as "great," "my friend from the beginning" and – perhaps his highest compliment of all – a "big fixture" on TV.
"Maybe I'm being just nice to them because I want their vote," Trump said to a murmur of laughter from the lawmakers, who hours later returned to their desks in the Senate to hear the day's arguments in a trial to decide whether to remove him from office.
For a president who came to power eschewing Washington politics, Trump ran a textbook insider counteroffensive to the impeachment trial, allies and political veterans said. From courting vulnerable senators facing reelection to focusing on the economy, trade and foreign policy, the White House mostly avoided the confusion and confrontation that has plagued other moments of Trump's tumultuous presidency.
Trump was guided by Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, whose steady maneuvering and relentless calls for patience in closed-door meetings with his colleagues kept the Republican caucus almost entirely intact.
Trump and McConnell viewed party unity as critical not only to the president's reelection in November but also to retaining the GOP majority in the Senate because it would allow them to delegitimize the effort as partisan.
In the end, the trial fizzled, but Trump did not secure a unanimous result. Democrats fell far short of the 67 votes needed to remove the president from office. The Senate voted 52-48 to acquit Trump on the charge that he abused his power and 53-47 on the charge that he obstructed Congress. Utah Sen. Mitt Romney, who has had an adversarial relationship with Trump for years, was the sole Republican who voted to convict Trump on abuse of power.
From the beginning, few expected the GOP-controlled Senate to remove the president on charges he abused his power by pressuring Ukraine to launch an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden, a political rival. Trump and McConnell mostly avoided new drama during the third presidential impeachment trial in the nation's history, and the likelihood Trump would be removed became more remote each day.
Republicans said the White House approach mirrored a strategy embraced by President Bill Clinton during his impeachment in 1999 as he fended off charges that he lied about his affair with intern Monica Lewinsky.
Setting the table
Soon after announcing she would vote to acquit Trump, Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, walked off the Senate floor Tuesday to explain how she reached that decision.
Facing a tough reelection, Collins said she started the trial by reviewing her notes from the Clinton trial, which unfolded in her first term. She wanted Trump's trial to look like Clinton's. By joining forces with Sens. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska; Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn.; and Romney she had the leverage to make that happen.
"That's when I went to (McConnell) and said that I felt we should have the same kind of schedule, including an up or down vote on witnesses," Collins said. "That's how that provision got into the resolution" to create more expansive rules for the trial.
For McConnell and Trump, work on the trial began long before the opening arguments. McConnell sought to craft rules that would allow centrists such as Collins to argue they were giving the impeachment charges a full vetting and not burying them in a "sham trial," as some critics suggested. McConnell agreed to expand the trial schedule and allow evidence gathered by the House to be automatically considered in the trial.
McConnell, the wily six-term Senate veteran from Kentucky, worked to shut down support within the GOP for calling witnesses.
Some Republicans, including Trump, initially wanted to summon witnesses such as Biden's son Hunter, who they expected would help exonerate the president or at least fling mud at Democrats. McConnell warned that opening the door to witnesses would introduce uncertainties and lead to "mutually assured destruction" for both parties.
That argument was reinforced for Republicans when The New York Times reported Jan. 26 that former top national security aide John Bolton heard Trump connect his desire for a Ukrainian inquiry into Biden to nearly $400million in U.S. aid he was withholding from Kiev.
The Senate voted Jan. 31 against hearing from witnesses. McConnell and Trump survived their first major test.
On the other side of Pennsylvania Avenue, Trump's trade event Jan. 29 was the culmination of a months-long outreach campaign that began in September when House Democrats opened their impeachment inquiry into his interactions with Ukraine.
The charm offensive, including White House movie nights and personal phone calls, was not aimed at wavering Republicans such as Collins or Alexander but lawmakers up for reelection such as Sens. Martha McSally, R-Ariz., and Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, who would benefit from Trump's help and had been cautious in their remarks about the pressure campaign against Ukraine.
McSally and Ernst attended the trade event and were recognized by Trump.
Sticking to script
When the Senate trial got fully underway Jan. 22, Trump was 4,000 miles away in Switzerland announcing that the United States would join an initiative to plant 1 trillion trees.
The global effort, intended to offset carbon emissions, met with skepticism from climate advocates. For Trump, those arguments were beside the point.
Between the time of his return from the World Economic Forum in Davos and his acquittal, Trump unveiled a Middle East peace plan, hosted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, signed the United States-Mexico-Canada trade agreement, attended a manufacturing event in Michigan and delivered his third State of the Union address.
Though Trump often discussed the impeachment at those and other events, he always framed the trial as a contrast to his own efforts on the economy, trade and foreign policy.
"You know, we are having probably the best years that we've ever had in the history of our country, and I just got impeached. Can you believe these people?" Trump said to thunderous applause at a rally Jan. 30 in Iowa.
"No, that's not going to work," he declared. "Watch. Just watch."
By trying to shift the focus to day-in, day-out White House events, Trump took a similar approach to Clinton's in 1999. During his trial, Clinton hosted events on the economy, met with the Palestinian Authority's Yasser Arafat and traveled to Jordan.
"They ran a sophisticated, Clinton-like approach," said Sam Nunberg, a former Trump campaign official.
What Trump didn't do during the trial was almost as notable as what he did: He didn't attack wavering Republicans. He tweeted only once about Collins during the trial, saying she was doing an "incredible job" as Maine's senior senator.
Patience and discipline
After The New York Times reported about an upcoming book by Bolton, senators huddled behind closed doors in McConnell's office for 90 minutes. They emerged without clarity on how to proceed in the face of growing Democratic demands to haul Bolton before the Senate. The former aide said he would testify if subpoenaed.
Some centrist Republicans, including Romney, signaled they would be open to joining Democrats in that request. With a thin 53-47 majority in the Senate, McConnell could afford only three Republican defections on any of his votes.
Over the next few days, McConnell calmed his restive caucus by preaching patience and playing for time. The approach appeared to work. When no additional Bolton bombshells dropped, it became clear within days that Democrats didn't have the votes for witnesses. Only two Republicans joined Democrats on the vote, Romney and Collins.
"McConnell is the big winner," said Lawrence Jacobs, a University of Minnesota political scientist. "He held together a fractious caucus despite the remarkably tantalizing Bolton reporting."

Is it really paid family leave? Trump's push for bill in SOTU differs from most proposals on the issue

Texto completo: President Donald Trump called for paid family leave Tuesday night in the State of the Union, the first Republican president to do so. But the bill he supported does not offer what has generally been considered paid family leave.
It is a bipartisan bill, introduced in December by Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz., and Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La. And it would enable new parents to collect a portion of their future child tax credits early and receive a smaller credit for the next 10-15 years.
Here's why it's different from most paid family leave proposals.
It does not provide a new source of funding to pay parents during leave; instead, they borrow from their future selves. It covers only leaves for babies or newly adopted children under 6; it does not cover care for sick family members or to take care of personal medical problems. And it does not guarantee that a person's job is protected when taking the leave.
Supporters of the bill describe it as a partial solution and a place to start, and say it doesn't preclude Congress from pursuing more comprehensive paid leave. It has some important advantages, they say: Its sponsors are bipartisan, which is rare on this issue. It doesn't raise taxes or create a mandate for businesses, two top priorities for Republicans. It also gives parents the freedom to use the money as they see fit, whether as wage replacement while on leave or to pay for infant or adoption expenses.
"Not only is it a good solution, but it's possible in the political world we live in today," Sinema said at an American Enterprise Institute and Brookings event in September.
Since first campaigning for president, Trump has expressed support for some kind of paid parental leave, and it has been a policy goal of his daughter, Ivanka.
Until Monday, the White House had said it was keeping every plan under consideration. This is the first time it endorsed one.
Traditionally, Republicans haven't supported paid leave - voicing concern about spending on new government programs and burdening businesses. So why is a Republican administration doing so?
Politically, analysts say, it appeals to a group of voters they need: suburban women, especially those who voted for Trump in 2016 but have considered Democrats since then.
"Everyone's talking about suburban female voters because they're deciding elections," said Olivia Perez-Cubas, a spokeswoman for the Winning for Women Action Fund, a political group dedicated to electing Republican women.
Paid leave, in general, is an easy sell with voters. Families need it - 72% of mothers and 93% of fathers with children at home are in the labor force - and a large majority of voters support it. But Americans, like their elected representatives, disagree on the details, particularly how to pay for it.
There is one model of government-run paid leave that has already been successfully adopted in the United States. In eight states and the District of Columbia, paid leave has been financed by a small payroll tax increase, paid by employees and employers. This is also the model that Democrats have proposed for all Americans, in a bill called the Family Act.
The child tax credit is worth up to $2,000 per child. If the Trump-backed bill passed, the average worker with a new child could receive $5,000, and then collect $500 less in child tax credits each year for 10 years.
The Family Act has minimal GOP support, and the deal breaker is the tax increase.
"A payroll tax increase is not going to be passed into law anytime soon," Ivanka Trump said on "Face the Nation" on CBS in December.

Texto completo: A Chinese doctor who was reprimanded by security police for warning fellow doctors about the initial coronavirus outbreak has died of the illness, according to Wuhan Central Hospital.
Li Wenliang, 34, an ophthalmologist at Wuhan Central Hospital, was "unfortunately infected during the fight against the pneumonia epidemic of the new coronavirus infection," the hospital said on its social media account. "We deeply regret and mourn this."
He died early Friday despite an "all-effort rescue" after contracting the virus Jan. 30, according to The People's Daily, the newspaper of China's Communist Party.
The World Health Organization tweeted, "We are deeply saddened by the passing of Dr Li Wenliang. We all need to celebrate work that he did" on the virus.
In a posting on social media, Li alerted fellow doctors Dec. 30 about the emergence of a SARS-like illness, warning them to wear protective clothing to avoid infection, the newspaper said. Wuhan is the epicenter of the coronavirus that has claimed 565 lives among more than 28,300 cases.
Four days later, Li was summoned by security police and forced to sign a
letter that accused him of "making false comments" that had "severely disturbed the social order," according to the BBC. Police said he was one of eight people under investigation for "spreading rumors," the BBC reported.
Authorities later apologized to Li, who became a national hero as a whistleblower as the illness spread.
The chief epidemiologist at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention told the editor of the state-owned Global Times that China should praise the eight Wuhan whistleblowers.
"They were wise before the outbreak," though any judgment needs to be backed by scientific evidence, Zeng Guang said.
From his hospital bed, Li broke his police-imposed silence in late January, telling The New York Times in an interview by text message, "If the officials had disclosed information about the epidemic earlier, I think it would have been a lot better. There should be more openness and transparency."
Commentary on the social media account of the Supreme People's Court criticized the police for their actions, saying that although the initial reports by Li and others about a possible SARS outbreak were wrong, they were a useful alert that should have been allowed: "If the public listened to this 'rumor' at that time and adopted measures such as wearing a mask, strict disinfection and avoiding going to the wildlife market based on the panic about SARS, this may be a better way for us to prevent and control new pneumonia today."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – From the details of the "perfect" call to allegations of a shadow foreign policy, the impeachment proceedings provided an unprecedented view of the inner workings of President Donald Trump's White House.
The inquiry unearthed a trove of text messages, testimony and documents from players in the Trump administration's campaign to pressure Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter, who worked for a Ukrainian energy company. But the House investigation and the Senate trial left many questions unanswered.
'No guardrails' on foreign policy
On an audiotape released in late January, Trump orders the removal of U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch. The president was not talking to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo but to Lev Parnas, an associate of his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, who blasted Yovanovitch as disloyal.
Parnas and his associate Igor Fruman face campaign finance charges in New York.
Fiona Hill, Trump's former national security adviser for Europe and Russia, painted a vivid picture of White House disarray. Last fall, Hill testified that she was shocked to learn that Gordon Sondland, Trump's ambassador to the European Union, was put in charge of Ukraine policy, an unusual portfolio for him since Ukraine is not part of the EU. She said he didn't appear to be receiving the required briefings for meetings he held with foreign leaders.
"It's like basically driving along with no guardrails and no GPS on an unfamiliar territory," she said. Sondland gave out his cellphone number – and hers – to foreign officials whose communications were vulnerable to Russian espionage, she said. "We had all kinds of officials from (foreign governments) … literally appearing at the gates of the White House, calling on our personal phones," she recounted.
Relations with Ukraine
Ukraine is at war with Russia and needs American support to ward off Moscow's attacks on its sovereignty. Friday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo landed in Kiev and promised unwavering U.S. support for Ukraine.
Pompeo did not invite Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to the White House – a visit the Ukrainian leader sought to bolster his global standing.
Giuliani has continued to pursue his investigation of Joe and Hunter Biden, who was on the board of Ukrainian gas company Burisma when his father was vice president.
Trump and Giuliani promoted allegations that Biden, while vice president, sought to have a Ukrainian prosecutor fired so he would not investigate Hunter and Burisma. Biden said he helped oust the prosecutor because he was widely viewed as corrupt, and no evidence of wrongdoing by Hunter Biden has been uncovered.
Trump's shadow secretary of state
Giuliani may not have an official diplomatic title in Trump's State Department, but the impeachment proceedings revealed his outsized influence on Ukraine matters.
He reached out directly to Zelensky and dispatched associates to carry out Trump's wishes on Ukraine.
Sondland said he worked with Giuliani at "the express direction of the president" to pressure Ukrainian officials for political favors.
The evidence showed that Giuliani used official State Department channels – including Trump's special envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker. He also relied on two nondiplomats, Fruman and Parnas, to carry out elements of the campaign.
Did Pompeo try to stop Giuliani?
Pompeo has said little about how much he knew of the Ukraine pressure campaign and what role he played, if any, in executing it, though other officials contended he was fully aware and may have helped facilitate some of the efforts by Giuliani and others.
Sondland said he kept Pompeo and other State Department officials "in the loop" about Ukraine. The diplomat produced emails to Pompeo and other top Trump administration officials, showing he communicated with them regularly about his efforts.
The State Department released records showing Pompeo had two phone calls with Giuliani in late March as Giuliani ramped up pressure on Ukrainian officials to open the Biden investigations.
"I don't have much to say with respect to the Ukraine investigation," Pompeo said in November.
GAO says Trump violated law
In January, the Government Accountability Office, a nonpartisan watchdog, concluded the White House broke the law when it withheld nearly $400 million in military aid to Ukraine, a finding the White House rejected.
Democratic lawmakers cited the report in arguing that Trump abused his power. The Impoundment Act governs Congress' constitutional power of the purse, but violations do not carry criminal penalties.
Did Trump commit a crime?
Trump's legal team called the impeachment case "structurally deficient," saying neither of the two articles of impeachment – abuse of power and obstruction of Congress – are violations of federal criminal statutes. Democrats said the language in the Constitution suggests that abuse of power was at the heart of why the founders included an impeachment clause in the document.
Whistleblower corroborated
The president's impeachment was set off by an anonymous whistleblower complaint lodged Aug. 12 to the intelligence community's inspector general, accusing Trump of abusing his power to pursue investigations that politically benefited him.
The complaint centered on Trump's call with Zelensky on July 25, when the U.S. president urged his counterpart to announce the Biden investigations. The nine-page complaint alleged the Trump administration carried out a months-long pressure campaign in Kiev that subverted U.S. diplomatic channels.
The whistleblower, identified only as an intelligence community official, is protected from retaliation by a federal statute shielding employees or contractors who want to report wrongdoing by the government.
The president and his defenders argued the account relied on secondhand information, but the complaint was largely corroborated through testimony from 18 witnesses, including foreign service officials and career diplomats, during the House impeachment inquiry.
Acting Ukraine Ambassador William Taylor told lawmakers he "became increasingly concerned that our relationship with Ukraine was being fundamentally undermined." Alexander Vindman, the top Ukraine expert on the National Security Council, testified he sounded the alarm about the pressure campaign to the agency's lead counsel.
Hill, the former NSC senior director for Europe and Russia, told Congress that national security adviser John Bolton was furious about the push to solicit political investigations from Ukrainian officials. According to New York Times reports about Bolton's forthcoming book, the president directly told his national security director that he was withholding aid in exchange for the investigations.
After the complaint's release, the White House released a rough summary of the call in which Trump urged Zelensky to open inquiries into the Bidens. Trump described the call as "perfect."
The whistleblower's identity
Republicans, including the president, made several attempts to out the individual, accusing House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., of coordinating with the whistleblower to hatch the impeachment drive.
Schiff denied knowing who the person is and rejected allegations that his committee helped write the complaint or coached the whistleblower.

Facial recognition gets scrutiny in NJ

Texto completo: Private companies create huge databases of images from social media. Ring doorbell cameras give police intimate access to citizens' front porches. And now New Jersey leaders are weighing what to do about the use of your pictures in face-matching programs.
Amid local and national concerns over privacy rights, the state's top cop, the attorney general, is working on a policy that would dictate when prosecutors and police across the state can use facial recognition technology.
At least one state lawmaker says its time to put a pause on use of the technology, a moratorium that would allow lawmakers to work out rules or decide whether it should be banned entirely.
And this is happening as an unanswered question looms: How widely is the technology used in New Jersey?
"We don't know who is using it, we don't know how they're using it," said Assemblyman Andrew Zwicker, D-Mercer. In fact, there's a bevy of questions surrounding the relatively new technology, he said.
"Who is using it?" he said. "Is it accurate? What are they doing with that information? Who are they sharing that information with? What's the impact on someone's life who has now been identified?"
Zwicker introduced a bill that would require law enforcement agencies to hold public hearings before using facial recognition technology. But after a nearly two-hour hearing earlier this week when experts raised concern about accuracy of the technology and individual privacy, Zwicker said he's exploring what more may need to be done.
"Making sure we're in front of this now is critically important," he said, noting the rapid pace at which technology advances.
Facial recognition software compares two images for similarities. It can be used to verify someone's identity as a security measure by comparing just two images, or to identify one picture among a group of images, such as comparing a suspect photograph with a group of mugshots. It can unlock your iPhone or iPad and will be used this year to identify athletes competing in the Tokyo Olympics, the first time facial recognition has been used in Olympic history.
While the technology has been around for decades, advancements have made it more affordable and more accessible for private sector use, said Jake Parker, a lobbyist for the industry group Security Industry Association, whose members include facial recognition developers and security companies.
Images used for comparison can come from in-house databases, like a police department's mugshot collection, or more controversially, private companies like Clearview AI, an app that says it pulled billions of photos from across the web, including social sites like Facebook. One in two American adults were in a law enforcement picture database in 2016, according to a nationwide analysis by Georgetown Law's Center on Privacy & Technology. The analysis urged governments to regulate use of the technology, which it said was less accurate than fingerprint analysis, to protect individuals' rights and civil liberties.
Yet it is the collection of images by Clearview AI that has sparked a fire in New Jersey. This month, after The New York Times revealed the extensive cache of images collected by Clearview AI, and that it was working with more than 600 police departments across the country, New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir Grewal told law enforcement officers across the state to stop using it.
Grewal's office is working on issuing a statewide directive to law enforcement about when and how they can use facial recognition technology, Assistant Attorney General B. Stephan Finkel told lawmakers this week. Also underway is a survey to understand which departments were using Clearview AI, Deputy Director of the Division of Criminal Justice Christine Hoffman told lawmakers. Clifton and Livingston police used the program, according to testimony at the hearing. "We still have only preliminary results but the majority of the counties that have reported in were exploring it on a trial basis and in many cases simply ran officers' photos through the system," Hoffman said. "So I would not characterize this as extensive use at this point in time based upon those results."
But that's just for Clearview AI, not the hundreds of other private companies now offering facial recognition services. It's not clear how extensively the technology is being used in New Jersey. A spokesman for the attorney general declined to answer questions about which police departments use it. In Newark, the state's largest city, officials confirmed police use facial recognition to help identify possible suspects. "It has worked well for us over the past few years, especially in cases of robberies and burglaries where surveillance cameras are typically available to capture good quality, up-close suspect images," Newark Department of Public Safety Director Anthony F. Ambrose said in a statement.
Newark police keep their own database of images for comparison and can also access one maintained by New Jersey State Police, he said. A spokeswoman said police do not use facial recognition on the citywide system of publicly accessible surveillance cameras known as Citizens Virtual Patrol. The state Department of Motor Vehicles has used the technology for years, scouring their in-house database of more than 23 million driver photographs to detect duplicates that could signal fraud. More than 100 people were brought up on criminal charges as a result, the state announced in 2014.
The technology is not used by law enforcement in many of the state's largest cities, including Camden, Edison, Jersey City, Lakewood and Toms River, according to police officials or spokespeople in each of those jurisdictions. At least 30 police departments in New Jersey have agreements with Amazon-owned Ring doorbell cameras to access videos, though it's unclear if they're also using facial recognition technology.
The American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey says facial recognition shouldn't be used anywhere, pointing to consequences including wrongful arrest that could come based on an incorrect identification.
Six cities in California and Massachusetts have banned the use of facial recognition technology, according to Molly Linhorst, a law fellow at the ACLU of New Jersey. Three states — California, Oregon and New Hampshire — have banned its use only for body-worn cameras, but none have banned it completely, she said. A federal government study in December evaluated the accuracy of nearly 200 algorithms used in facial recognition software and found vast disparities in results, including that a single algorithm could have different accuracy rates for different demographic groups. For example, some algorithms had higher false positive rates when identifying images of African American women among a group of comparison images, according to the report from the National Institute of Standards and Technology.
"There is a lot about today's technology and its limits that we do not understand," Linhorst told lawmakers this week. "The fact that this technology proves so unreliable, and is more likely to harm communities that already experience significant discrimination and bias provides reason for us to stop acquiring and using facial recognition technology."
Zwicker suggested the technology could lead to widespread government surveillance, citing the classic dystopian novel by George Orwell.
"The biggest area of concern I have, an Orwellian '1984' scenario is the government having a surveillance state," he said. "We're in a place where our entire lives just about are happening online." Facial recognition is "just a piece of an enormous concern I have about privacy and ownership of who we are, our photographs our faces, how we walk, our personal information," he said. "It is being used now in ways we've never understood." Representatives of both Newark and the attorney general's office stressed that the technology is not used as the sole evidence to justify an arrest but can help identify a slew of possible suspects.
"We must independently verify someone's identity," Hoffman told lawmakers. "It's basically a pointer system and it's really nothing more than that."
Yet another concern is — with cameras virtually everywhere these days — if the technology could be used to identify people who are carrying out their First Amendment rights, such as during a protest or coming and going from church.
Responding to the concern that the technology would be used to effectively spy on the public, Finkel told lawmakers that "as far as we know that's not how it's used in New Jersey."

Texto completo: A public memorial service for Kobe Bryant, his daughter and seven others killed in a helicopter crash is planned for Feb. 24 at Staples Center, The Los Angeles Times reported Thursday.
The arena is where Bryant starred for the Lakers for two decades and the date 2/24 corresponds with the No. 24 jersey he wore and the No. 2 worn by his 13-year-old daughter, Gianna.
Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti has said a memorial would be held but his office had no other immediate comment.
Bryant was killed Jan. 26 when the helicopter carrying him, his daughter and the others crashed into a mountainside in Calabasas while flying to a girls basketball tournament at his Mamba Sports Academy. Gianna's team was coached by Bryant and was playing in the tournament.
No cause for the crash has been determined, though a preliminary report by the National Transportation Safety Board is expected soon.

Texto completo: A public memorial service for Kobe Bryant, his daughter and seven others killed in a helicopter crash is planned for Feb. 24 at Staples Center, The Los Angeles Times reported Thursday.
The arena is where Bryant starred for the Lakers for two decades and the date 2/24 corresponds with the No. 24 jersey he wore and the No. 2 worn by his 13-year-old daughter, Gianna.
Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti has said a memorial would be held but his office had no other immediate comment.
Bryant was killed Jan. 26 when the helicopter carrying him, his daughter and the others crashed into a mountainside in Calabasas while flying to a girls basketball tournament at his Mamba Sports Academy. Gianna's team was coached by Bryant and was playing in the tournament.
No cause for the crash has been determined, though a preliminary report by the National Transportation Safety Board is expected soon.

Japan races to build more coal-burning power plants

Texto completo: Just beyond the windows of Satsuki Kanno's apartment overlooking Tokyo Bay, a behemoth from a bygone era will soon rise: a coal-burning power plant, part of a buildup of coal power that is unheard-of for an advanced economy.
It is one unintended consequence of the Fukushima nuclear disaster almost a decade ago, which forced Japan to all but close its nuclear power program. Japan now plans to build as many as 22 new coal-burning power plants - one of the dirtiest sources of electricity - at 17 different sites in the next five years, just at a time when the world needs to slash carbon dioxide emissions to fight global warming.
"Why coal, why now?" said Kanno, a homemaker in Yokosuka, the site for two of the coal-burning units that will be built just several hundred feet from her home. "It's the worst possible thing they could build."
Together the 22 power plants would emit almost as much carbon dioxide annually as all the passenger cars sold each year in the United States. The construction stands in contrast with Japan's effort to portray this summer's Olympic Games in Tokyo as one of the greenest ever.
The Yokosuka project has prompted unusual pushback in Japan, where environmental groups more typically focus their objections on nuclear power. But some local residents are suing the government over its approval of the new coal-burning plant in what supporters hope will jump-start opposition to coal in Japan.
The Japanese government, the plaintiffs say, rubber-stamped the project without a proper environmental assessment. The complaint is noteworthy because it argues that the plant will not only degrade local air quality, but will also endanger communities by contributing to climate change.
Carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere is the major driver of global warming, because it traps the sun's heat. Coal burning is one of the biggest single sources of carbon dioxide emissions.
Japan is already experiencing severe effects from climate change. Scientists have said that a heat wave in 2018 that killed more than 1,000 people could not have happened without climate change. Because of heat concerns, the International Olympic Committee was compelled to move the Tokyo Olympics' marathon events to a cooler city almost 700 miles north.
Japan's policy sets it apart from other developed economies. Britain, the birthplace of the industrial revolution, is set to phase out coal power by 2025, and France has said it will shut down its coal power plants even earlier, by 2022. In the U.S., utilities are rapidly retiring coal power and no new plants are actively under development.
But Japan relies on coal for more than a third of its power generation needs. And while older coal plants will start retiring, eventually reducing overall coal dependency, the country still expects to meet more than a quarter of its electricity needs from coal in 2030.

Is it really paid family leave? Trump's push for bill in SOTU differs from most proposals on the issue

Texto completo: President Donald Trump called for paid family leave Tuesday night in the State of the Union, the first Republican president to do so. But the bill he supported does not offer what has generally been considered paid family leave.
It is a bipartisan bill, introduced in December by Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz., and Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La. And it would enable new parents to collect a portion of their future child tax credits early and receive a smaller credit for the next 10-15 years.
Here's why it's different from most paid family leave proposals.
It does not provide a new source of funding to pay parents during leave; instead, they borrow from their future selves. It covers only leaves for babies or newly adopted children under 6; it does not cover care for sick family members or to take care of personal medical problems. And it does not guarantee that a person's job is protected when taking the leave.
Supporters of the bill describe it as a partial solution and a place to start, and say it doesn't preclude Congress from pursuing more comprehensive paid leave. It has some important advantages, they say: Its sponsors are bipartisan, which is rare on this issue. It doesn't raise taxes or create a mandate for businesses, two top priorities for Republicans. It also gives parents the freedom to use the money as they see fit, whether as wage replacement while on leave or to pay for infant or adoption expenses.
"Not only is it a good solution, but it's possible in the political world we live in today," Sinema said at an American Enterprise Institute and Brookings event in September.
Since first campaigning for president, Trump has expressed support for some kind of paid parental leave, and it has been a policy goal of his daughter, Ivanka.
Until Monday, the White House had said it was keeping every plan under consideration. This is the first time it endorsed one.
Traditionally, Republicans haven't supported paid leave - voicing concern about spending on new government programs and burdening businesses. So why is a Republican administration doing so?
Politically, analysts say, it appeals to a group of voters they need: suburban women, especially those who voted for Trump in 2016 but have considered Democrats since then.
"Everyone's talking about suburban female voters because they're deciding elections," said Olivia Perez-Cubas, a spokeswoman for the Winning for Women Action Fund, a political group dedicated to electing Republican women.
Paid leave, in general, is an easy sell with voters. Families need it - 72% of mothers and 93% of fathers with children at home are in the labor force - and a large majority of voters support it. But Americans, like their elected representatives, disagree on the details, particularly how to pay for it.
There is one model of government-run paid leave that has already been successfully adopted in the United States. In eight states and the District of Columbia, paid leave has been financed by a small payroll tax increase, paid by employees and employers. This is also the model that Democrats have proposed for all Americans, in a bill called the Family Act.
The child tax credit is worth up to $2,000 per child. If the Trump-backed bill passed, the average worker with a new child could receive $5,000, and then collect $500 less in child tax credits each year for 10 years.
The Family Act has minimal GOP support, and the deal breaker is the tax increase.
"A payroll tax increase is not going to be passed into law anytime soon," Ivanka Trump said on "Face the Nation" on CBS in December.

The arena is where Bryant starred for the Lakers for two decades and the date 2/24 corresponds with the No. 24 jersey he wore and the No. 2 worn by his 13-year-old daughter, Gianna.
Bryant was killed Jan. 26 when the helicopter carrying him, his daughter and the others crashed into a mountainside in Calabasas while flying to a girls basketball tournament at his Mamba Sports Academy. Gianna's team was coached by Bryant and was playing in the tournament.
A game between the Clippers and the Grizzlies is scheduled for Feb. 24 at 7:30 p.m. at Staples.
Knicks to hire agent as team boss: Leon Rose, an NBA agent at Creative Artists Agency, will take over as Knicks team president, The New York Times reported. While Rose doesn't have experience in basketball operations, he has a deep well of connections to star players, including Carmelo Anthony and LeBron James, in his decades as an agent.
The Knicks moved swiftly to replace Steve Mills, who the team announced was leaving his post Tuesday.
Rose, a native of Cherry Hill, N.J., represented the likes of Allen Iverson, Richard Hamilton and LeBron James.
Layups: Giannis Antetokounmpo scored 36 points and grabbed 20 boards, and the Bucks beat the visiting 76ers 112-101. Antetokounmpo had 30-plus points and 15-plus rebounds for the fifth straight game and the 14th time this season as the Bucks won for the 12th time in 13 games. ... Despite playing with a sprained toe, Zion Williamson scored 21 points to help the host Pelicans beat the Bulls 125-119. It was the Bulls' fourth loss in a row. ... Julius Randle scored 22 points, and the Knicks rallied from 10 down in the fourth to beat the visiting Magic 105-103 for their third straight win. ... LeBron James selected Lakers teammate Anthony Davis with the first pick in the All-Star player draft for the Feb. 16 game in Chicago. Antetokounmpo, the other captain, took 76ers big man Joel Embiid with the second pick.

Texto completo: New York Times Co. reported another quarter of strong digital-subscription growth in the fourth quarter but suffered declines in advertising revenue, which the company said would continue in the following quarter.
The publisher reported net income of $68.2 million, or 41 cents a share, up 24% from $55.2 million, or 33 cents a share, in the same period a year earlier. This was partly helped by a lower effective tax rate that drove tax costs down to $7.7 million for the quarter from $23.3 million a year earlier.
Revenue rose 1.1% to $508.4 million, driven by a 4.5% increase in subscription revenue and a 30% rise in other revenue, mostly coming from new television program "The Weekly" and licensing revenue from Facebook News.
The Times reported adjusted earnings from continuing operations -- which exclude severance costs, nonoperating retirement costs and special items -- of 43 cents a share. Analysts polled by FactSet had forecast adjusted earnings of 35 cents a share on revenue of $502 million.
The company said it would increase its dividend to 6 cents a share from 5 cents starting in April.
Digital-subscription growth continued with 342,000 additional customers in the quarter. Of those, 232,000 signed up to the paper's core news offering and 110,000 for its lower-cost cooking and crossword apps. The Times said it ended the quarter with 4.4 million paid digital subscribers -- 3.4 million for core news and 966,000 for the cooking and crossword apps. Including print subscribers, the Times had 5.3 million paying customers at the end of the quarter.
Overall advertising revenue fell 11% to $171.3 million. Revenue from digital advertising declined 11% to $92.2 million. Print advertising revenue fell 11% to $79.1 million.

Texto completo: WORLD BRIEFS
JERUSALEM - At least three Palestinians were killed during clashes with Israeli security forces in the West Bank on Wednesday and Thursday, and an Israeli soldier was seriously wounded in a car ramming in Jerusalem overnight, in a surge of violence following the release of the long-awaited - and highly contentious - American plan for Middle East peace.
Among the three Palestinians were a Palestinian Authority police officer, whom Israeli forces said they shot by mistake, and a police cadet.
A fourth man armed with a pistol opened fire before noon Thursday on Israeli border police officers outside the Aqsa Mosque compound in the Old City of Jerusalem, wounding one in the arm.
The attacker, who was shot dead by the police, was an Arab resident of Haifa, in northern Israel.
As one attack appeared to trigger the next, an Israeli soldier was slightly wounded on Thursday afternoon by Palestinian sniper fire north of Ramallah in the occupied West Bank.
On Wednesday, Muhammad al-Haddad, 17, was killed by a shot in the chest, doctors said, as youths clashed with Israeli forces in the volatile Palestinian city of Hebron in the southern West Bank.
KILLING OF TERRORIST LEADER IN YEMEN IS CONFIRMED
WASHINGTON - The United States killed the leader of al-Qaida's affiliate in Yemen, the White House confirmed on Thursday.
The confirmation came about a week after The New York Times first reported that the United States believed it had killed Qassim al-Rimi, the Qaida leader, in January after months of tracing him.
The CIA carried out the airstrike using an unmanned drone, an intelligence official said.
The White House statement had little detail about the operation, but said it was carried out at the direction of Mr. Trump. The statement said al-Rimi's death will degrade the Yemen affiliate and the global Qaida movement and "brings us closer to eliminating the threats these groups pose to our national security."
SCOTTISH OFFICIAL QUITS OVER MESSAGES TO 16-YEAR-OLD
LONDON - The finance secretary of Scotland resigned abruptly, hours after British news outlets revealed that he had sent suggestive messages to a 16-year-old boy on social media, the Scottish government confirmed Thursday.
The finance secretary, Derek Mackay, 42, is reported to have sent the boy hundreds of messages, beginning in August and continuing into this month, according to The Scottish Sun. Those messages included telling the boy he was "really cute" and inviting him to attend a rugby match with him.
Mr. Mackay, who was seen as a rising star in the Scottish National Party, said in a statement that he had tendered his resignation to the head of the Scottish government, Nicola Sturgeon, late Wednesday and apologized "unreservedly" to the boy and his family.

Syrian government troops entered a strategic town in northwestern Idlib province - the country's last rebel stronghold - Thursday after fierce clashes with opposition fighters, state media reported.

Texto completo: President Donald Trump's State of the Union address was classic Trump. It was full of drama and hype, braggadocio and exaggeration, showmanship and pettiness. It was also substantive and effective.
This is the riddle of Mr. Trump: The singular mix of pomposity and real accomplishment. The constant shooting of himself in the foot combined with incisive political instincts.
How does someone who has been the subject of so much disdain, indeed outright hate, boost his poll numbers in the middle of an impeachment trial?
How does someone walk into the House chamber, where a majority voted to impeach him, and leave that room triumphant?
It pains his critics to admit it, but Mr. Trump is a force of nature.
And that means he gets things done. Consider his record, which he reviewed Tuesday night: We are seeing the lowest unemployment rate in most of our lifetimes, especially for African Americans. We have a booming stock market, which some experts said would permanently crash if Mr. Trump was elected. Many in middle America now have fat 401(k)s for the first time in their lives and can contemplate retirement while they still have some active years left. The president won new trade agreements with Canada, Mexico and China, just as he promised to do and though his critics said he could never get them done once we were in a presidential election cycle. And even his foreign and military policy seems to be working out better than anyone thought it would. Instead of protracted military engagements, he favors quick strikes. He talks tough and carries a big stick. And instead of globalism and alliances, the president talks about "America First" and secure borders, which many Americans find obviously sensible.
There is also much to criticize in the Trump administration. Most of those quick strikes are unconstitutional. And our troops are still on the ground and at risk in places that will never be stable, never mind improved. The coal, steel and auto industries have not "come back" in any significant way. Massive deregulation will hurt many people in many ways.
But the president does have a record of accomplishment.
His problem, from the standpoint of roughly half the country, is his nature, his persona, his character. And, secondarily, how that nature shapes his understanding of the presidency.
One observer said: If the goal is to unite the country, he has failed.
The president, as we saw in the House chamber this week, is a deeply divisive figure. And the division has worn many Americans out, and down. For them, a booming economy and national security without a new war with Iran is not enough. Character trumps prosperity. National goodwill matters more than a good economy.
But for many other Americans, also roughly half the country, what the president accomplishes matters more than how he behaves.
And the few, but decisive, voters who are in the middle and on the fence may doubt that any Democrat running for president can accomplish more or usher in an era of good feeling.
What the president made clear in the State of the Union is that he is not changing. With him we get the whole package - the building and the bluster. The campaign will be both. He will go to the people as himself, unapologetically. He will run on his record, but he will also run as a salesman and a showman and a street fighter. He sees himself as a doer and the president as an executive, not a head of state or moral leader. In a little less than 10 months the voters will make the call.

Jack Burns, comedic partner to George Carlin and Avery Schreiber

Texto completo: A writer since childhood, Jack Burns told the Globe in 1973 that he had finished his first novel at age 11. But it was comedy sketches, rather than books, that brought him fame.
After serving in the Marines, and stints at radio stations in Brockton and Athol, Mr. Burns was working at WEZE-AM in Boston when he met George Carlin.
“We got into the habit of clowning around together when off the air," Mr. Burns said in 1973. “Carlin left to go to Fort Worth, Texas, in 1959, and the following year I decided to make the break, too."
Mr. Burns, whose early comedy performances with Carlin led to a more memorable engagement as the hilariously pompous half of the comedy duo Burns and Schreiber, died on Jan. 27 in Toluca Lake, Calif. He was 86.
Burns and Schreiber became one of the best-known comedy teams of the 1960s and '70s. Afterward, Mr. Burns found further success writing for television. The New York Times reported that Patti Lawhon, the executor of his estate, announced the death of Mr. Burns, who learned in 2017 that he had pancreatic cancer.
Mr. Burns was a popular comic presence for nearly 40 years, beginning with a brief, successful stint as Carlin's partner. After his long and fruitful partnership with Avery Schreiber ended, Mr. Burns went on to produce “The Muppet Show," writing about two dozen episodes.
He also wrote for such variety shows as “Hee Haw" and comedy specials starring Flip Wilson and Paul Lynde. And he lent his brash, booming voice to such animated series as “Animaniacs" and “Wait Till Your Father Gets Home," as well as to an ad campaign promoting the use of safety belts. He was the voice of a crash-test dummy.
But it was Burns and Schreiber that cemented his fame. The two comics became known for routines that were flecked with social satire, exquisite timing, and rapid-fire repartee, exemplified by their signature “yeah/huh?/yeah/huh?" bantering.
Mr. Burns' loud know-it-all persona played well off Schreiber's warm, low-key one, particularly when Schreiber, as he so often did, punctured Mr. Burn's pomposity. That was never more vividly on display than in their best-known sketch, in which a blithely bigoted passenger (Mr. Burns) blathers to a world-weary taxicab driver (Schreiber).
In one version of the sketch, Mr. Burns recognizes Schreiber from a previous ride and tells him that he sells tinsel for a living.
Burns: Tinsel, like you put on your Christmas tree.
Schreiber: Like you put on your Christmas tree.
Burns: Oh, I remember now, you told me. You're not of the Christian persuasion.
Schreiber: I'm not persuaded.
Burns: You're what we call your Judaic.
Schreiber: If it makes you uncomfortable, you know you can get another cab.
Burns: Are you kidding? I don't care what a man is. Besides, I couldn't get another cab this time of night anyway.
When they performed the sketch as part of a Second City revue in Manhattan in 1964, New York Times critic Brian O'Doherty praised Mr. Burns as a “connoisseur of vulgarity who apparently can sweat at will," and Schreiber as “an underplaying comic master attached to a Stalinesque mustache."
The duo spent parts of a dozen years together and had their own series on ABC-TV.
Their breakthrough occurred when they performed at a fund-raiser to benefit a Los Angeles School where Schreiber's wife taught.
“I was glad to help out," Mr. Burns told the Globe in 1973. “We were only supposed to do 20 minutes, but it stretched to an hour, went over fabulously well, and then the offers started pouring in."
Referring to the hosts of that era's TV shows, he added: “We wound up doing three Flip Wilsons, three Johnny Carsons, one 'Midnight Special,' all NBC, and two David Frosts."
John Francis Burns was born in Boston on Nov. 15, 1933, and grew up in Newton and Brookline. His father, Garrette, was a military officer; his mother was Mary (Hogan) Burns.
Mr. Burns served in the Marines in Korea in the early 1950s, and upon returning home, “I used the GI Bill to get two years of training at the Leland Powers School," he recalled in 1973.
When he and Carlin were working at WEZE, they became friends and realized each had developed a comedic Irish character.
“Jack's guy had more of an edge," Carlin said of his banter with Mr. Burns in his autobiography, “Last Words" (2009, with Tony Hendra). “These two guys would talk together for hours. They were great characters for saying things you weren't quite willing to say yourself."
Upon both leaving Boston, they became a team and found success in Los Angeles. “Lenny Bruce spotted us at a coffee house, where we worked for no pay, and got us a booking in Chicago," Mr. Burns later recalled.
Burns and Carlin, as the act was known, were booked at top nightclubs around the country, appeared on Jack Paar's “Tonight" show and recorded an album at the Hollywood nightclub Cosmo Alley — although it was released in 1963 (a year after they broke up) as “Burns and Carlin at the Playboy Club Tonight."
After the split, Mr. Burns joined the Compass Players, an improvisational troupe, and then moved to its successor, The Second City, where he met Schreiber and developed the taxicab sketch.
“It's a give-and-take thing," Mr. Burns said in 1973 of how they created their routines. “Usually I write a sketchy outline, then we bat ideas around in our old improvisational way, then I do the final polish."
During their run as a comedy team, Mr. Burns was cast in 1965 on “The Andy Griffith Show" as Deputy Sheriff Warren Ferguson, replacing Don Knotts, who had played Deputy Sheriff Barney Fife since the series began in 1960. Mr. Burns had hoped that he would be able to adapt his onstage style to the character and not remind viewers of the beloved Knotts.
But it did not work out, and Mr. Burns lost the role after 11 episodes. Griffith blamed himself, telling the Times, “We tried to force Jack to do those wild, peculiar things that Knotts did — and he was willing to try — but we made a mistake."
In 1973, Mr. Burns told the Globe that he had married Violet Bardo in 1965. He retired nearly 20 years ago and leaves no immediate survivors, the Times reported. Schreiber died in 2002.
He was a guest star on various TV shows from the late 1960s until the late '90s. He also had established a successful second career off camera.
For a decade he was integral to the Muppet empire. In addition to his association with “The Muppet Show," which began in 1976 and earned him two Emmy nominations, he collaborated with Jerry Juhl to write “The Muppet Movie" (1979) and was a writer on two straight-to-video Muppet productions, both released in 1985.

Texto completo: CHILD CARE
Au pair agency leaving Massachusetts in wake of minimum wage ruling
A California-based au pair agency is pulling out of Massachusetts on the heels of a December federal court ruling that foreign childcare providers must be paid the state minimum wage, raising families' weekly costs by as much as $333 a week. EurAupair matches au pairs with about 30 families in Massachusetts every year, 20 of whom have decided to continue until their contract is up. But the agency, which has been placing caregivers here since it started in 1989, won't send any new au pairs to Massachusetts due to the court ruling, said President Bill Gustafson. Go Au Pair, in Utah, said that more than a third of its host families in Massachusetts have left the program due to the cost increase but doesn't anticipate ending operations in the state until families stop seeking out au pairs. About 1,500 au pairs are placed in Massachusetts a year by 13 agencies around the country, according to the State Department, which runs the program. No other departures have been announced, but the newly formed advocacy group Au Pair Families of Massachusetts expects other agencies to end operations here, too. The court ruling technically applies to every state with minimum wages above the federal rate and could affect the entire program. — KATIE JOHNSTON
ENERGY
Federal lawmakers ask GAO to investigate slow approval of renewable energy projects
Frustrated by permitting delays, members of the Massachusetts congressional delegation have asked the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office to investigate the Trump administration's review and approval of fossil fuel and renewable energy projects. Their Feb. 5 letter to the GAO raises the concern that the Trump administration is using a double standard: expediting fossil fuel projects while slowing down renewable energy projects. The letter doesn't mention Vineyard Wind by name but that Massachusetts project, planned by Avangrid and Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners, would be the first major offshore wind farm built in the United States. It has been beset by permitting delays at the federal level. The letter was drafted by Senator Elizabeth Warren's office. Signatories included Warren, Senator Edward Markey, and Representatives Joseph Kennedy, Richard Neal, William Keating, James McGovern, Katherine Clark, Seth Moulton, and Lori Trahan, all Democrats. — JON CHESTO
SOCIAL MEDIA
Twitter gains daily users
Twitter topped analysts' projections for fourth-quarter revenue and added more new daily users than expected, citing product improvements and more personalized content on its social network. The shares rose the most in almost a year. Revenue rose 11 percent to $1.01 billion, slightly higher than the $994.5 million predicted in a Bloomberg analyst survey. The company added 7 million daily active users in the period, and now has 152 million people logging in daily on average, up 21 percent from the same period a year earlier. — BLOOMBERG NEWS
ECONOMY
Productivity growth at record level in 2019
US productivity rebounded in the final three months of last year, helping to boost productivity growth for the year to the best showing in nearly a decade. The Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics said Thursday that productivity grew at an annual rate of 1.4 percent in the October-December quarter, reversing the direction of a 0.2 percent drop during the third quarter. For the year, productivity increased 1.7 percent, up from 1.3 percent advances in both 2017 and 2018. While a 1.7 percent rise in productivity is considered modest, it was the best annual showing since a 3.4 percent advance in 2010. — ASSOCIATED PRESS
MEDIA
New York Times dismisses notion of 'Trump bump'
The New York Times doesn't want to hear about the “Trump bump" anymore. The publisher said a broad array of news coverage helped to power a continued rise in digital subscriptions last quarter, with earnings and revenue beating analysts' expectations. The results caused Times Company shares to jump more than 12 percent and reach their highest point in 15 years. Industry analysts have often linked the Times' dramatic growth in digital subscribers to President Trump's unique ability to create a never-ending news cycle that attracts more readers. On an earnings call Thursday, Times Company chief executive Mark Thompson sought to put that notion to rest, calling it a “faulty analysis" and saying the Times doesn't rely on a single story anymore to attract customers. He cited the paper's breadth of journalism, including recent coverage of the coronavirus, fires in Australia, the death of Kobe Bryant, and Prince Harry and Meghan Markle giving up their royal titles. — BLOOMBERG NEWS
HIGHER EDUCATION
Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, UMass Lowell team up
A Maine naval shipyard and the University of Massachusetts Lowell have entered into an educational partnership to share technology and enhance student education. The five-year agreement between Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, located in Kittery, Maine, and UMass was signed at a ceremony Tuesday, the Portsmouth Herald reported. It will allow the Navy to make its scientific, engineering, and technology assets and subject matter experts available to university faculty. In turn, the Navy is able to involve UMass Lowell faculty and students in innovative projects underway at the shipyard. — ASSOCIATED PRESS
RETAIL
Coach parent company beats expectations but offers a warning
The luxury brand Tapestry handily beat quarterly profit expectations but warned that the virus outbreak in China is “significantly impacting" its business. The owner of Coach and Kate Spade said Thursday that the majority of its stores in China are now closed. Meanwhile, Tapestry announced Thursday that Liz Fraser has been named CEO and brand president of Kate Spade. The Kate Spade label has been the weaker spot within the Tapestry portfolio. — ASSOCIATED PRESS
MORTGAGES
Rates keep going down
Mortgage rates continued to decline, giving homebuyers a crack at the lowest borrowing costs in more than three years. The average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage was 3.45 percent, down from 3.51 percent last week and the lowest since July 2016, Freddie Mac data showed Thursday. The 15-year average slipped to 2.97 percent from 3 percent. — BLOOMBERG NEWS

Pizza Hut continues to struggle
Yum! Brands Inc. fell after its Pizza Hut chain weighed on fourth quarter results and the company said the virus outbreak in China will be a headwind this year. Pizza Hut's same-stores sales, a key measure for retailers, dropped by a more-than-estimated 2 percent in the fourth quarter, according to a statement. Yum! Brands chief executive David Gibbs said that the deadly coronavirus may impact the company — which still generates revenue from Asia — and that it was closely monitoring the situation. — BLOOMBERG NEWS

Senators criticize slow progress on rail tunnel
Fifteen Democratic Senators admonished the Trump administration for the sluggish progress on a new rail tunnel between New York and New Jersey, centerpiece of the so-called Gateway program of major infrastructure projects in the critical transit artery. In a letter Thursday, the Democrats, including minority leader Chuck Schumer of New York, Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, urged Federal Railroad Administration Administrator Ronald Batory to say when the department will complete an environmental review needed to advance the new Hudson River tunnel, estimated to cost $11.3 billion. — BLOOMBERG NEWS

Texto completo: The company hit a milestone in the fourth quarter, passing $ 800 million in annual digital revenue, an amount that came more from readers than advertisers.
In the last three months of 2019, The New York Times Company reached one major business goal and got more than halfway toward another. Both are related to what has become the company's main business: making money directly from customers who pay to do the crossword, check out recipes and follow the news on their computers, tablets and phones.
As the company disclosed last month, in 2019 it passed $ 800 million in annual digital revenue for the first time, an objective it had pledged to meet by the end of 2020. Most of that $ 800.8 million -- more than $ 420 million -- came from news subscribers.
In the fourth-quarter earnings report that came out on Thursday, the company said its total subscription figure was over five million, a high. The company's stated goal is to reach 10 million by 2025.
The 5,251,000 total subscriptions include customers who receive ink-and-paper editions on their doorsteps and driveways and the close to 3.5 million who are digital-only customers for the core news product, the company said. With impeachment proceedings underway and the 2020 presidential campaign heating up in the quarter, digital-only news subscriptions grew by 30 percent in the last three months of 2019 compared with the year before. The other Times subscribers are the nearly one million who pay for the Cooking and Crossword apps.
The company added more than one million net digital subscriptions last year -- the most new subscriptions annually in the newspaper's history.
The price of its shares rose nearly 13 percent in trading on Thursday, closing at $ 38.55.
In a statement, Mark Thompson, the Times Company president and chief executive, called 2019 "a record-setting year for The New York Times's digital subscription business, the best since the company launched digital subscriptions almost nine years ago."
Advertising was a weak spot, with print and digital ad revenue each declining slightly more than 10 percent from the previous year's final quarter. The company attributed the drop in digital ad revenue to an unusually strong finish to 2018.
The company said it expected to continue generating revenue more from readers than from the advertisers that were once integral to the newspaper business. Not unrelated: The price of subscriptions is going up.
Starting this week, the price of a digital-only subscription to the main news product every four weeks will increase to $ 17, from $ 15, the company said. It is the first increase in the digital subscription price since The Times decided to charge readers for online content in 2011.
"We believe that our loyal subscribers know that their financial contribution plays an essential role in maintaining the quality, breadth and depth of the report they value so much," Mr. Thompson said in the statement.
In its forecast for the first quarter of 2020, the company said it expected recent trends to continue. That means a steady rise in overall and digital-only subscriptions amid a 10 percent decline in advertising revenue.
The company also said it expected operating costs to go up, owing to its "continued investment in the drivers of digital subscription growth." In the fourth quarter, costs rose because of "growth in the number of newsroom employees" and "digital product development employees," the company said.
Operating profit in the fourth quarter increased 4.4 percent from a year earlier, to $ 78 million. Revenue was up 1.1 percent, to $ 508.4 million.
The company also announced on Thursday that its board of directors had voted to increase the per-share dividend, the quarterly payment it makes to anyone who owns a share of Times stock, by a penny, to 6 cents.
The current payout of a nickel a share costs the company $ 33 million a year.
The Crossword and the Cooking apps continued to bring in customers who may want little to do with the news. The cooking product attracted 68,000 new subscriptions in the final quarter of last year.
Under a reorganization announced last month, the two apps, along with the NYT Parenting site, will be grouped with The Wirecutter, the product recommendation site acquired by the Times Company in 2016, and led by David Perpich.

They Reject Trump's Foreign Policy, and Don't Agree on One of Their Own

Texto completo: A New York Times survey of the Democratic presidential hopefuls found differences on Israel, North Korea, cyberweapons and the use of military force.
Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Andrew Yang say that if elected, they would continue President Trump's personal diplomacy with Kim Jong-un of North Korea. But Joseph R. Biden Jr., Michael R. Bloomberg and Amy Klobuchar would not: That approach has just propped up a dictator while his nuclear arsenal expands, Mr. Biden argues.
Mr. Sanders, Ms. Warren and Tom Steyer say they might put conditions on American military aid to pressure Israel to stop building settlements in disputed territory, or to discourage annexation of the West Bank. But only Mr. Steyer says he would reverse Mr. Trump's move of the American embassy to Jerusalem.
Only Mr. Biden and Mr. Bloomberg would consider using military force to protect the free shipment of oil supplies, which could escalate toward a military confrontation with Iran. But only Ms. Warren and Mr. Yang said they wouldn't consider using force to stop North Korea or Iran from testing a nuclear weapon or missile, something that does not usually pose an immediate threat to American territory or troops.
These are a few of the deep differences among the Democratic presidential candidates on foreign policy and national security, based on responses to a New York Times survey on a range of issues that the nation's commander in chief is likely to face in 2021.
As seven of these candidates gather on Friday night for their next televised debate, the survey shows a party less committed to the Obama era than one might expect, and unified by very few issues: most prominently containment of Russia, which many Democrats believe stole the presidency in 2016.
At the same time, the Democrats say that America's role in the world would look radically different under them than under President Trump: a rapid rebuilding of alliances, no more "America First" unilateralism and a renewed commitment to human rights, even if it comes at some economic cost.
"There are so many easy ways a Democratic president could reverse the damage of Trump decisions that foreign policy hasn't been a way to discriminate among the candidates," said Kori Schake, the director of foreign and defense policy at the American Enterprise Institute and a Republican who served in the Bush White House. "But the differences are really significant."
Ms. Schake said she was "particularly surprised" by the candidates' broad willingness to entertain pre-emptive force against Iran simply for conducting a missile test, while they broadly rejected the use of force to preserve oil supplies.
Veterans of the Obama administration say that the candidates have a lot of work to do to convince voters -- even those who reject Mr. Trump's worldview -- to focus on their approaches to building alliances, using force and competing with an aggressive Russia and a rising China.
"Every presidential campaign I've ever been a part of, there's a commander in chief ad," Wendy Sherman, who conducted the day-to-day negotiations with Iran for the 2015 nuclear agreement, told an audience at the University of New Hampshire last week. "Everybody says at least once, you know, 'You can rely on me at 3 in the morning."' But the issues are "rarely central except when we're in crisis."
She noted that only a month ago, with the targeted killing of Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, the Iranian military leader, "we were on the brink of war."
And the Democrats, it turns out, even disagree on whether that killing was legal, or wise.
Differing views on the use of military force
Perhaps the most striking takeaway from the survey was that the candidates have sharply different views on what circumstances justify the use of military force, aside from responding to an attack on the United States or a treaty ally.
Their disagreements were particularly clear on whether they would consider using force to pre-empt an Iranian or North Korean nuclear or missile test -- in other words, to prevent a launch that was meant to prove a country's capability, but not to attack American territory, troops or interests. Presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama each faced that decision and decided not to strike.
Most of the candidates campaigning as moderates said they would consider it: Mr. Biden, Mr. Bloomberg, former Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado and former Gov. Deval Patrick of Massachusetts. Interestingly, one of the most liberal candidates, Mr. Sanders, said the same.
Only Ms. Warren and Mr. Yang said they would not consider force in that situation. Ms. Klobuchar did not answer the question, and Mr. Steyer gave a noncommittal answer.
But when asked if they might use force to protect the flow of oil through the Persian Gulf or other areas, only Mr. Bloomberg and Mr. Biden said yes.
"I would consider the use of the military, in partnership with allies, to defend shipping lanes or important assets if the disruption to oil supplies posed a threat to the global economy," Mr. Biden said.
The candidates unanimously said that they would consider using military force for a humanitarian intervention, or that they could at least envision a scenario in which they might. But three -- Mr. Biden, Ms. Warren and Mr. Steyer -- included caveats. Mr. Biden specified that he was referring to stopping genocide or the use of chemical weapons. Ms. Warren and Mr. Steyer emphasized that military intervention should remain the last resort, and all three said they would undertake such intervention only as part of a coalition.
There was a split on whether President Trump acted legally -- or wisely -- when he ordered the killing of General Suleimani, the commander of Iran's Quds Force.
Mr. Bloomberg argued that the killing was legal and would have been justifiable if there was evidence of an imminent attack (evidence the Trump administration initially claimed existed, but never produced). But he said it would remain unclear whether it was wise until he knew whether it had reduced Iran's support of terrorism or helped stop Iran's nuclear program for a time.
Most of the other candidates leaned toward opposing the killing, with Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren giving the most definitive rejections. (Mr. Biden did not answer the question.)
"The right question isn't 'was this a bad guy,' but rather 'does assassinating him make Americans safer?"' Mr. Sanders's campaign said. "The answer is clearly no."
Diplomacy with Iran and North Korea
Just about all of the candidates said they would re-enter the Iran nuclear deal that Mr. Trump abandoned in 2018, as long as the Iranians also came back into compliance.
But they were divided on pursuing Mr. Trump's leader-to-leader diplomacy with North Korea.
Mr. Biden views the one-on-one negotiations with Kim Jong-un as a form of reward for a dictator, one in which Mr. Trump has gotten nothing in return because the North has continued to build up its nuclear arsenal and its missile program. "As Kim advances his ability to hit the United States -- and anywhere else in the world, for that matter -- we can't rely on Trump's tweets or threats to keep us safe," he said. Mr. Biden did say he was open to meeting with Kim if it wasn't just for show.
Mr. Bloomberg and Ms. Klobuchar agreed that they would halt the one-on-one meetings. But Mr. Sanders and Mr. Yang said they would keep the talks going, but insisted they would get concrete results.
Ms. Warren said she was open to such talks only "if it advances substantive negotiations, but not as a vanity project." Any meeting with Mr. Kim, she added, would be "part of a clear strategy, with substantive agreement already reached at the working level, and developed in close coordination with our allies and partners."
The Israeli-Palestinian conflict
The candidates described their views on how to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict before Mr. Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, announced a radically new plan that would make permanent all the Jewish settlements in disputed lands and let Israel -- and Israel alone -- declare Jerusalem its capital.
The Democrats generally embraced an older idea: that Israel should return largely to its pre-1967 borders, with agreed-upon land swaps to reflect some modern realities of how control has shifted on the ground.
But only Mr. Steyer said he would reverse Mr. Trump's decision -- widely criticized at the time -- to move the American embassy to Jerusalem. Mr. Sanders, though, made his agreement to keep the embassy there contingent on Israeli behavior, saying moving it back to Tel Aviv "would be on the table if Israel continues to take steps, such as settlement expansion, expulsions and home demolitions, that undermine the chances for a peace agreement."
Most striking was the divide among the candidates on whether to put conditions on military aid to Israel -- something Mr. Sanders, Mr. Steyer and Ms. Warren indicated they would consider if Israel continued to build settlements in disputed territory.
Keeping a two-state solution viable "may mean finding ways to apply pressure and create consequences for problematic behavior by both parties, as previous Democratic and Republican presidents have done," Ms. Warren said. "Today, the continued expansion of Israeli settlements and the increasing normalization of proposals for Israel to annex parts or all of the West Bank are the most immediate dangers to the two-state solution."
Battling in cyberspace
Of the Democratic candidates, only Mr. Biden has been involved in a critical judgment call about whether to use cyberweapons against another country: He was a participant in the decisions over a covert attack on Iran's nuclear enrichment center at Natanz.
So it was interesting that Mr. Biden embraced the idea -- enacted in 2018 in an order issued by Mr. Trump -- that United States Cyber Command can launch certain attacks without the explicit presidential approval required for, say, launching a nuclear weapon.
While some cyberattacks could involve "such a significant impact on civilian targets that a presidential order is appropriate," he said, "others may be so precise or contained that a presidential order is unnecessary."
Only Mr. Bennet agreed with him.
By contrast, Ms. Warren argued that presidential approval was vital and "the same laws, values and oversight under which the United States pursues military action should be consistently applied across domains."
There were internal tensions in some of the candidates' other cybersecurity responses.
Six of them -- Mr. Biden, Mr. Bloomberg, Ms. Klobuchar, Mr. Yang, Mr. Bennet and Mr. Patrick -- said they supported "persistent engagement," the new American strategy of planting malware deep inside adversaries' computer networks to provide early warning of attacks, and a pathway for counterattack. But none of those candidates said they would accept Russia, China, Iran or North Korea planting their own code in American power or communications grids.
China and human rights
Presidents have always struggled to deal with China. When Mr. Clinton ran for president in 1992, he denounced the "butchers of Beijing" and then ushered China into the World Trade Organization.
More than a quarter of a century later, the Democratic candidates still struggled with the question of whether China's human rights violations merited cutting off trade with what is now the world's second largest economy.
Almost all of them said that normal relations with China should depend on its "respect for Hong Kong's political independence" and an end to its crackdown on Uighurs and other Muslim minorities. But several spoke about balancing the need to work with China on a variety of common interests -- from climate change to North Korea -- without forgetting about American human rights concerns.
"We will need to work with China to advance some of our highest priority national interests, including addressing the climate crisis and nonproliferation, even at the same time as we address areas where we have little common ground," Ms. Warren said. "But our values cannot be used as a bargaining chip."
It sounded a lot like the Clinton administration's explanation.
HOW WE COLLECTED THE DATA
In December, we sent a questionnaire to the 14 Democratic presidential candidates who were then in the race. Eleven completed it, including two -- Cory Booker and Marianne Williamson -- who subsequently dropped out of the race.
John Delaney (who has also since dropped out) and Tulsi Gabbard did not respond, and Pete Buttigieg answered only some of the questions.

Texto completo: The mistakes do not appear intentional, but they raise questions about whether there will ever be a completely precise accounting.
Results from the Iowa Democratic caucuses were delayed by "quality control checks" on Monday night. Days later, quality control issues have not been resolved.
The results released by the Iowa Democratic Party on Wednesday were riddled with inconsistencies and other flaws. According to a New York Times analysis, more than 100 precincts reported results that were internally inconsistent, that were missing data or that were not possible under the complex rules of the Iowa caucuses.
In some cases, vote tallies do not add up. In others, precincts are shown allotting the wrong number of delegates to certain candidates. And in at least a few cases, the Iowa Democratic Party's reported results do not match those reported by the precincts.
Some of these inconsistencies may prove to be innocuous, and they do not indicate an intentional effort to compromise or rig the result. There is no apparent bias in favor of the leaders Pete Buttigieg or Bernie Sanders, meaning the overall effect on the winner's margin may be small.
But not all of the errors are minor, and they raise questions about whether the public will ever get a completely precise account of the Iowa results. With Mr. Sanders closing to within 0.1 percentage points with 97 percent of 1,765 precincts reporting, the race could easily grow close enough for even the most minor errors to delay a final projection or raise doubts about a declared winner.
The errors suggest that many Iowa caucus leaders struggled to follow the rules of their party's caucuses, or to adopt the additional reporting requirements introduced since 2016. They show that the Iowa Democratic Party, despite the long delays, failed to validate all of the results fully before releasing them to the public.
Mandy McClure, a spokeswoman for the Iowa Democratic Party (I.D.P.), said the party reported the data as provided to it by the precinct caucuses.
"The caucus math work sheet is the official report on caucus night to the I.D.P., and the I.D.P. reports the results as delivered by the precinct chair," she said. "This form must be signed by the caucus chair, the caucus secretary and representatives from each campaign in the room who attest to its accuracy. Under the rules of the delegate selection process, delegates are awarded based off the record of results as provided by each precinct caucus chair."
Just about every election night includes reporting errors. They can be difficult to identify, but can often be corrected during a recount or a postelection canvass. This year's Iowa caucuses are the reverse: Errors are now easy to identify, and hard to correct.
The errors are detectable because of changes to the way the Iowa Democratic Party reports its results, put in place after the Sanders campaign criticized the caucus results in 2016. This cycle, and for the first time, the party released three sets of results corresponding to different steps in the caucus process. The rules are complex and thorough, and they create conditions in which the results can be obviously inaccurate or inconsistent within a precinct.
First, caucusgoers express their preference for a candidate upon arrival, and these votes are recorded in a "first alignment." Then, candidates with limited support at a precinct, usually less than 15 percent, are deemed not viable; their supporters get a chance to realign to support a viable candidate. The preference at this point is recorded as well, and it's called the final alignment.
Viable candidates can't lose support on realignment, but there were more than 10 cases where a viable candidate lost vote share in the final alignment, even though that is precluded by the caucus rules.
No new voters are permitted to join the caucus after the first alignment. But in at least 70 precincts, more than 4 percent of the total, there are more tabulated total votes on final alignment than on first alignment.
Many of these cases could be simple tabulation mistakes in a precinct caucus that otherwise went smoothly, like a West Des Moines precinct that reported the first alignment results only for the "nonviable" candidates (those who didn't meet the 15 percent threshold) but still reported final alignment results for the viable ones. Others appear to be more serious.
At the next step in the process, each precinct allots county delegates based on final preference, and these county delegates are reported to the news media as "state delegate equivalents," which approximate the number of delegates won at the state convention. Each precinct caucus gets a set number, but a handful of precincts allotted more state delegate equivalents than they had available.
Notably, there are dozens of precincts where there is a discrepancy between the final preference vote and the number of state delegate equivalents allotted. This includes more than 15 cases in which a candidate received fewer state delegate equivalents than another despite receiving more votes in the final alignment.
In these cases, it is not obvious whether the state delegates or the final alignment results were reported inaccurately.
The Iowa Democratic Party has corrected some errors, but the errors became far more frequent on Wednesday as the count dragged on.
On Wednesday afternoon, the Iowa Democratic Party released a wave of results showing Deval Patrick sweeping central Des Moines. That was incorrect. Mr. Sanders's votes had been reported as being for Mr. Patrick, while Elizabeth Warren's tallies went to Tom Steyer.
A plausible explanation is that an Iowa Democratic Party staff member accidentally copied the results of one column too far to the left in a spreadsheet for some precincts. Such errors inevitably occur in manual data entry, but the Iowa Democratic Party does not appear to have enough quality checks to assure that it reports accurate results.
The Iowa Democratic Party quickly corrected these errors, and they are not included in our overall count of discrepancies in more than 100 precincts. The party has not yet addressed other irregularities reported to it or circulating on social media. In another case, The Times alerted the party to an error at 6 p.m. Eastern on Wednesday that remained in the data released several hours later.
The Times is continuing to report the Iowa Democratic caucus results as released by the party and has alerted the party to an extensive list of precinct errors.
There is no reason to believe that Mr. Sanders or Mr. Buttigieg did materially better in the contaminated precincts than they did elsewhere, either over all or controlling for their demographic characteristics. But the tabulated result could be close enough for the remaining ambiguity to preclude a projection of a winner.
Even if the appropriate candidate is deemed the winner, the irregularities in the results are likely to do little to restore public confidence in the Iowa caucuses.

Texto completo: A family movie from the director Tom McCarthy debuts on Disney Plus. And a new comedy series hits Apple TV Plus.
What's Streaming
TIMMY FAILURE: MISTAKES WERE MADE (2020) Stream on Disney Plus. The filmmaker Tom McCarthy's 2015 investigative journalism nail-biter, "Spotlight," won an Academy Award for best picture. "Timmy Failure," his first movie since, is also about professional investigators. One of them is an 11-year-old. The other is a polar bear. Based on a series of children's books by Stephan Pastis (who wrote the screenplay with McCarthy), "Timmy Failure" centers on a boy (Winslow Fegley) who runs a detective business in Portland, Ore., with the help of a big, hairy Arctic escapee. While the movie is skipping theaters in favor of being released directly on Disney's streaming service, "it owes more to independent cinema than anything," McCarthy told The New York Times last year. It is both family-oriented and proudly weird.
HONEY BOY (2019) Stream on Amazon. Shia LaBeouf plays a version of his own father in this intense drama, which was written by LaBeouf and directed by Alma Har'el. Telling a fictionalized account of LaBeouf's early stardom, more recent erratic behavior and rehabilitation, "Honey Boy" splits its story between two time periods: The 1990s, where it focuses on a young child actor, Otis (Noah Jupe), being bullied by his father (LaBeouf), and the 2000s, where it turns to an older Otis (Lucas Hedges), a blockbuster star with an explosive offscreen life. LaBeouf's "drawling evocation of his own father is a bravura incarnation of resentment," Glenn Kenny wrote in his review for The Times. But the film at large, Kenny wrote, is "a flex: an assertion of the clout LaBeouf claims, in interviews, to no longer have."
MYTHIC QUEST: RAVEN'S BANQUET Stream on Apple TV Plus. Some of the minds behind "It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia" trade that show's dingy bar lighting for the fluorescent shine of a video game studio in this new comedy series, the latest entry in Apple's quest to shake up the world of streaming TV. Created by the "It's Always Sunny" stars and producers Rob McElhenney and Charlie Day along with Megan Ganz, another producer of that show, "Mythic Quest" centers on a fictional video game company headed by a controlling, self-obsessed creative director (McElhenney, whose character does things like bring his own PowerPoint remote to somebody else's presentation). The employees under his reign are played by a cast that includes Danny Pudi ("Community"), David Hornsby (another "It's Always Sunny" face), Imani Hakim ("Everybody Hates Chris") and F. Murray Abraham.
What's on TV
THE DEMOCRATIC DEBATE 8 p.m. on ABC. Qualifying candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination will take the stage in New Hampshire on Friday night for their latest debate, capping off a turbulent week that began with Iowa caucuses thrown into disarray by a delay in results. The debate will give candidates a chance to appeal to voters before next week's New Hampshire primaries. It's scheduled to last three hours, giving any TV audiences made anxious by the proceedings a chance to decompress with the season-four premiere of HBO's marijuana-dealer series, HIGH MAINTENANCE, which will air on that network at 11 p.m.

Texto completo: 'NATE' AT IMPROV ASYLUM (Tuesday to Thursday, 7:30 p.m.; through Feb. 16). In case you missed it last year, Natalie Palamides's gender-bending take on toxic masculinity returns for a six-night run at this club in Chelsea. Jason Zinoman wrote in The New York Times that "Nate" is "a startlingly unusual creation -- a clown show about consent that managed to be funny and ferocious, broad and nuanced, a prank on the audience that felt like a tickle." The character Palamides has created for this one-hander (left) is a far cry from the family-friendly, demure one she portrays on Progressive commercials. Sean L. McCarthy

THE NATION; ELECTION 2020; DNC chairman calls for recanvass in Iowa; 'Enough is enough,' Perez declares after botched caucuses.

Texto completo: The chairman of the Democratic National Committee called Thursday for a review of the vote count in the party's botched Iowa caucuses as new questions emerged about the integrity of the results in the first contest of the 2020 presidential race.
"Enough is enough," party Chairman Tom Perez said on Twitter.
Perez lacks the power to require a recanvass, but Iowa Democratic Chairman Troy Price said the party was prepared to conduct a review of the tally if any of the presidential campaigns ask for one by noon Friday. No candidate has made such a request public.

Software breakdowns, clogged phone lines and mistakes in the tabulation have turned the Iowa contest into a major embarrassment for the Democratic Party as it seeks to rally around a challenger to run against President Trump in November. The party released no results until Tuesday afternoon, and votes from dozens of precincts remained uncounted late Thursday.
The Associated Press, which news organizations rely upon to assess election returns, announced Thursday that it was unable to declare a winner.
"The Associated Press calls a race when there is a clear indication of a winner," said Sally Buzbee, AP's senior vice president and executive editor. "Because of a tight margin between former Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Bernie Sanders and the irregularities in this year's caucus process, it is not possible to determine a winner at this point."
With 100% of the precincts reporting their state delegate count by Thursday night, Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., was a whisker ahead of Vermont Sen. Sanders, 26.2% to 26.1%, followed by Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, 18%, former Vice President Joe Biden, 15.8%, and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, 12.3%.
Yet Sanders declared victory at a campaign stop Thursday in New Hampshire, noting that he'd actually won the most votes in both rounds of voting in Iowa's caucuses and would ultimately wind up with the same number of delegates to the Democratic National Convention that Buttigieg will get. He called the tabulation "a big screw-up."
"Some 6,000 more Iowans came out on caucus night to support our candidacy than the candidacy of anyone else," Sanders said. "And when 6,000 more people come out for you in an election than your nearest opponent, we here in northern New England call that a victory."
Buttigieg made what amounted to an Iowa victory speech Monday night, even in the absence of results.
The New York Times reported Thursday that results released by the Iowa state party were riddled with inconsistencies, casting doubt on whether a precise final result will ever be possible. Some vote tallies did not add up, some precincts allotted the wrong number of delegates to certain candidates, and the state party's results did not all match those reported by the precincts, the Times said.
If a recanvass occurs, it would entail an audit of the tabulation worksheets submitted by managers of the 1,756 caucus precincts. The worksheets give totals for the first round of voting; totals for the second round of voting after candidates who got less than 15% in the first round were eliminated; and the allocation of state delegates to each candidate based on the final round of voting.
Price, the state Democratic leader, reiterated that "the reporting circumstances on Monday night were unacceptable," saying the party "identified inconsistencies in the data and used our redundant paper records to promptly correct those errors. This is an ongoing process in close coordination with precinct chairs, and we are working diligently to report the final 54 precincts to get as close to final reporting as possible."
Regardless of whether a recanvass takes place, the party's failure to report reliable results after three days has heightened calls for Democrats to drop the Iowa caucuses as the opening contest in their presidential nomination process. The meltdown has revived long-standing complaints that a predominantly white rural state is a poor representative of an increasingly diverse and urban party.
"I think the Democratic caucus in Iowa is a quirky, quaint tradition which should come to an end," Illinois Sen. Richard J. Durbin told MSNBC as the fiasco was unfolding Tuesday. "As we try to make voting easier for people across America, the Iowa caucus is the most painful situation we currently face for voting."
The Boston Globe editorial page suggested Wednesday that both Iowa and New Hampshire, which holds the first presidential primary, should no longer be allowed to exert disproportionate influence on U.S. elections, saying the demographics of both states "resemble 19th century America."
"With each passing election, the privileged place of Iowa and New Hampshire becomes harder to defend," the Globe said. "The vote-counting snafu in Iowa this week seems to have unleashed years of pent-up frustration about a system that is unfair to Americans in the 48 other states and continues to distort American politics."
Iowa's main function in the past has been to produce a windfall of media coverage and campaign donations for those who do well -- and to drive candidates who do poorly to quit the race. But no candidate has bowed out, and Buttigieg has been unable to fully capitalize on what might have been an unexpected victory, although he has risen this week in polls ahead of Tuesday's New Hampshire primary.
"There are no words for how disastrous it was and is," said Joe Trippi, a strategist who ran Democrat Howard Dean's 2004 presidential campaign. "Nothing close to that. Ever. It's an incredible snafu with big implications."
Still, Iowa Democrats are fighting to maintain their first-in-line spot in the presidential race.
"It didn't work great this time, but let's learn from it and let's go on," said Jean Hessburg, a former Iowa state party executive director. "I'm not one to throw the baby out with the bathwater. The caucuses have been and will always be a great example of democracy at its finest -- people talking about issues, people talking to each other, people actually participating in the voting process."
Jeff Link, a veteran Democratic operative in Iowa, said the state's caucus system was "not built for close elections," but suggested it nonetheless serves as a valuable launching ground for candidates like Buttigieg who start with no national profile and no major fundraising base.
"If that isn't proof that Iowa works and exists for a reason as a way to level the playing field," he said, "I don't know what else is."

Texto completo: Op-Docs is The New York Times's series of short documentaries made by independent filmmakers. One of those films, "Walk, Run, Cha-Cha," directed by Laura Nix, is nominated for an Academy Award on Sunday for best documentary (short subject). The film, which The Times produced with Concordia Studio and premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival last year, profiles a couple who reunited in California after the Vietnam War and then, 40 years later, rediscovered themselves on the dance floor. Here, Ms. Nix explains how she met the couple and why she wanted to make this film.
If you crossed paths with Paul and Millie Cao, a middle-aged couple who work in California as an engineer and an auditor, you might not guess that every chance they get, they put on sequin-covered costumes and head to a dance floor, where they transform into passionate ballroom dancers. That is where I met them six years ago, when I wandered into Lai Lai Ballroom and Dance Studio. They were part of a group of older Asian-Americans dancing the rumba in a room lit like a nightclub in suburban San Gabriel Valley, near Los Angeles.
I took dance classes at the studio for a year and discovered most of the instructors are professional ballroom dancers from Russia and Eastern Europe. Almost all their students come from the Asian diaspora -- mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Paul and Millie's country of origin, Vietnam. I struggled in waltz classes taught in Mandarin and learned the Taiwanese Tango from generous students who offered to show me the steps.
Eventually, I became friends with Paul and Millie, and their Latin-dance teachers, Maksym Kapitanchuk and Elena Krifuks. Paul and Millie have been known to practice four to five nights a week after work, diligently training their bodies for competitions and showcases, where they perform tightly choreographed routines wearing elaborate outfits. I began making this film motivated by the question, "What makes these two people so dedicated to dancing?"
Over time, I learned Paul and Millie's story of fleeing Vietnam as young lovers to come to the United States. Their back story is both ordinary and extraordinary, representative of many refugees who are forced to rebuild their lives. Creating a new life in America required Paul and Millie to reinvent themselves. While learning how to speak English, they worked multiple jobs, finished their college degrees, took care of their parents while raising a child and embarked on professional careers. Finding a way to survive defined their adult lives; they didn't have time for the extras.
Faced with middle age, Paul and Millie chose to reinvent themselves again. After decades of delayed gratification, this time they focused on what gives them joy. As you'll see in this Op-Doc, dance opened up a world of self-expression and pleasure for the couple, sparking a transition from responsible professionals to flamboyant performers pursuing their creative dreams.
My decision to tell a story about Paul and Millie's life in the present, and not solely focus on their past, was intentional. Films about refugees and immigrants are often focused on the point of entry, when the newly arrived are at their most vulnerable. But it's essential for us to hear stories about what happens next. Paul and Millie are refugees from Vietnam.
Paul and Millie are also working professionals, parents, dancers and American citizens who have lived in California for over 40 years. As with many Americans who started their lives in another country, their story embodies resilience and courage. Love and longing. Separation and reunion. These themes are visually reflected in the dance itself, in their tender glances, when he lifts her to the sky, the yearning in their gestures -- their ability to transform adversity into beauty.

Texto completo: The Vermont senator's announcement came as the Biden, Buttigieg and Warren campaigns are showing signs of financial strain.
Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont raised $ 25 million in January, his campaign said on Thursday, a staggering sum that gives him an enviable financial advantage at a crucial moment in the Democratic primary race.
He plans to use the windfall to immediately buy $ 5.5 million in television and digital ads across 10 states, at a time when some of his rivals are shifting or cutting their existing ad reservations.
The $ 25 million haul is more money than any other candidate raised in any full quarter during 2019, including several presidential hopefuls who hold the big-dollar fund-raisers that Mr. Sanders forgoes. The announcement is the latest sign of an epochal change in money in politics, with candidates now able to finance a top-tier national campaign fueled by masses of donors giving a steady stream of small amounts.
For Mr. Sanders's top rivals, the news is likely to be unsettling: Their campaigns are all showing signs of financial strain. Former Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., has briefly left the campaign trail to raise money, and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. is taking time next week for a new batch of fund-raisers.
Mr. Sanders can now plan past the New Hampshire primary on Tuesday with greater financial confidence, an important development given the possibility of an extended Democratic primary with multiple candidates including Michael R. Bloomberg, a self-financing billionaire whose full influence will not be felt until March because he is skipping the first four contests.
The Sanders campaign also announced that it had received 1.3 million donations in January, and that more than 1.5 million different individuals had donated over the course of the campaign.
"Working-class Americans giving $ 18 at a time are putting our campaign in a strong position to compete in states all over the map," said Faiz Shakir, Mr. Sanders's campaign manager, in a statement.
The Sanders ad buy includes California and Texas, where the campaign has already been advertising, as well as eight additional states it had not targeted: Arkansas, Colorado, Massachusetts, Minnesota, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Utah.
Mr. Sanders's show of financial might came as the Democratic candidates are still awaiting final results from Monday's Iowa caucuses, a delay that has had a dampening effect on any one contender developing momentum heading into New Hampshire. Mr. Buttigieg and Mr. Sanders are now all but tied in the Iowa delegate race, with 99 percent of precincts reporting, but the lack of an official winner makes it easier for Mr. Sanders to seize the spotlight with his good fund-raising news.
Both Mr. Sanders and Mr. Buttigieg are competing aggressively, along with other candidates, for a victory in New Hampshire, where Mr. Sanders hopes to establish himself as the liberal front-runner ahead of Ms. Warren (who finished third in Iowa) with a repeat of his big win in the state four years ago against Hillary Clinton. His January fund-raising total outpaced the $ 21.1 million he raised in January 2016 against Mrs. Clinton.
Despite only having a few days left to campaign before the New Hampshire primary, Mr. Buttigieg spent Wednesday night holding an evening fund-raiser in New York, with another one scheduled for Thursday morning.
A top adviser to Mr. Buttigieg, Michael Halle, wrote a thinly veiled post on Twitter suggesting where a Buttigieg-backing super PAC might best spend its funds, and even alluded to a message that the campaign would appreciate seeing put on television. "Pete's military experience and closing message from Iowa work everywhere especially in Nevada where it's critical they see this on the air through the caucus," Mr. Halle wrote.
Ms. Warren's campaign manager, Roger Lau, responded by pointing out what he called a "fun fact about how some campaigns exploit our broken campaign finance laws," suggesting that if Mr. Halle had written that message in private to a super PAC, it could constitute illegal coordination with an outside group.
For her part, Ms. Warren has cut nearly $ 500,000 in future ad reservations in Nevada and South Carolina over the last two days, according to the media tracking firm Advertising Analytics. Those are the two states that follow New Hampshire in voting in February.
"I just always want to be careful about how we spend our money," Ms. Warren told reporters in New Hampshire on Wednesday.
Ms. Warren's campaign told supporters in an email on Tuesday that the Iowa Democratic Party's inability to announce any results on Monday night had muted whatever financial boost she could have received from the caucuses. "We didn't get a big night of exciting news coverage about them (or the late-night boost in fund-raising that usually comes with it)," her campaign wrote.
As for Mr. Biden, he began 2020 with the least cash on hand of any of the four top candidates -- less than $ 9 million -- and his apparent fourth-place finish in Iowa already had some in the Democratic establishment skittish about his prospects.
His campaign had said ahead of the caucuses that January was his "strongest month of fund-raising since launch." An analysis of Federal Election Commission records indicates that his January total was somewhere between about $ 8 million (his previous high in October 2019) and $ 9.7 million (his April total).
On Wednesday, Mr. Biden was also moving around his ad reservations, with about $ 150,000 cut from South Carolina and reinvested in Nevada, according to Advertising Analytics. Nevada will hold its caucuses on Feb. 22, and South Carolina has its primary on Feb. 29.
The need for cash is apparent from Mr. Biden's schedule: In the days after the New Hampshire primary next week, he has no less than four fund-raisers, including two in New York, one in Denver and one in Reno, Nev.
A pro-Biden super PAC, Unite the Country, announced a $ 900,000 ad campaign in New Hampshire the day after the Iowa caucuses. That would be a sizable share of its remaining funds, according to previous announcements from the group.
Steve Schale, its executive director, had said the super PAC was on pace to spend about $ 6 million in Iowa, and the group announced on Jan. 31 that it had raised $ 7.6 million "to date."
As Mr. Biden and other candidates rush to refill coffers after spending millions in Iowa, Mr. Bloomberg, the billionaire former mayor of New York City who is self-financing his 2020 run, awaits the whole field in March.
Mr. Bloomberg's presence has acted as something of a potential safe harbor for more moderate donors concerned about both Mr. Sanders's strong showing in Iowa and Mr. Biden's weak one.

Texto completo: The man charged in a shooting at a Walmart that left 22 people dead had railed in a manifesto about "the Hispanic invasion of Texas."
EL PASO -- A federal grand jury on Thursday indicted the suspect in last summer's mass shooting at an El Paso Walmart on federal hate crime charges, accusing the 21-year-old former college student of targeting Hispanics in a racially motivated massacre that left 22 people dead.
Patrick Crusius of Allen, Texas, already faced state charges in connection with the Aug. 3 shooting. Prosecutors said he donned headphone-style ear protectors and carried an AK-47-style rifle as he opened fire inside the busy border-city Walmart. Within minutes, nearly 50 men, women and children were killed or wounded in the deadliest anti-Latino attack in modern American history.
In announcing the charges on Thursday evening in downtown El Paso, officials from the Justice Department and the F.B.I. said the gunman attacked the victims because of their actual and perceived national origin. The 90-count indictment charges him with 22 counts of hate crimes resulting in death, 23 counts of hate crimes involving attempted murder for those who were wounded and 45 counts of discharging a firearm in the commission of a hate crime.
"People in our nation have the right to go to a store on a Saturday morning without fear that they will be shot and killed because of who they are or where they are from," Eric Dreiband, the assistant attorney general for civil rights, told reporters on Thursday in El Paso.
"This hate crime may be considered an act of domestic terrorism," he said, adding that the suspect "tried to terrorize an entire community."
The federal government has identified racially motivated attacks as one of the nation's top national security threats. Hate crimes against Latinos rose more than 13 percent from 2017 to 2018, according to the F.B.I.'s annual compilation of bias-motivated attacks.
The attack at Walmart cut deep into the fabric of the binational, bicultural and bilingual city connected by bridges and generations of families to its sister city of Ciudad Juárez in Mexico. Most of the people killed or wounded were either Mexicans or Mexican-Americans. Minutes before the shooting, the suspect posted a lengthy anti-immigrant manifesto online, declaring that the attack was a response to "the Hispanic invasion of Texas" and "all the problems these invaders cause and will cause."
For months, Hispanic residents, elected officials and activists in El Paso and other Texas cities have been calling the Walmart shooting a hate crime. They had been calling on the Trump administration to take federal action in the largest anti-Latino attack in the country, just as Dylann S. Roof, the white supremacist who killed nine black parishioners in 2015 at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in South Carolina, was convicted on 33 federal charges that included hate crime charges.
"This was the intersection of racism and mass violence," said Texas State Representative César Blanco, a Democrat and Navy veteran whose district includes the Walmart. "What he did in our community, based on the manifesto that was posted in advance of the massacre, definitely tells us where his mind was."
In the aftermath of the attack, some in El Paso feared that copycat anti-Latino shootings would strike the city. As a result, several Hispanic residents and survivors sought to protect themselves -- buying firearms, target-practicing at shooting ranges and applying for state-issued licenses to carry handguns.
Many others, including some Democratic lawmakers, blamed the White House for stoking hatred against Latinos with anti-immigrant rhetoric and policies.
When asked by a reporter on Thursday about the administration's anti-immigrant rhetoric, the United States attorney in El Paso, John F. Bash, said the indictment charged the only person he believed was responsible for the attack -- the gunman.
"What we prosecute is crimes of violence," Mr. Bash said. "We don't prosecute speech. And what I can say to the Hispanic community is that the Justice Department is totally engaged in stopping people who, for whatever motivation, but in particular for hateful motivations, would plot acts of violence on other people."
In the six months since the shooting, El Paso remains in the midst of healing.
The Walmart store reopened just 12 weeks ago, and the last funeral a month before that -- the services for Jorge Calvillo García, 61, were delayed so his wounded son could attend after being released from the hospital. The last remaining patient at the University Medical Center of El Paso -- Mario De Alba, 48, a repairman from the Mexican state of Chihuahua who was shot in the back while shielding his wife and 9-year-old daughter -- left the hospital in November, but he is expected to return this month for a follow-up surgery. One other victim, Guillermo Garcia, a girls' soccer coach, has been hospitalized since the shooting and continues to receive treatment at Del Sol Medical Center.
"It's been a long six months," said Mr. Blanco, the state lawmaker. "This is another reminder that this is still a part of this process, and our community wants to heal, but we understand that the healing process will take many, many, many years."
The Justice Department said it had charged more than 330 defendants with hate crimes since the federal hate crimes law was expanded in 2009, including more than 70 over the past three years.
While the department under President Barack Obama worked to expand civil rights protections to more groups of people, including gay and transgender people, the Trump administration has argued that it is not the Justice Department's job to push the boundaries of who is protected.
Still, the department, under both Jeff Sessions and William P. Barr as attorney general, has continued to aggressively prosecute hate crimes. Mr. Sessions authorized that the murder of a transgender teen be prosecuted as a hate crime, even as the department resisted civil rights protections for transgender people.
The charges against the Walmart shooting suspect were filed just weeks after Jay Tabb, the head of national security for the F.B.I., said at an event in Washington that the bureau had seen "a significant increase in racially motivated violent extremism in the United States," along with an increase in white nationalism and white supremacy extremist movements.
The 2,300-word anti-immigrant manifesto traced to the El Paso suspect mentioned a conspiracy theory popular among white nationalists known as the "great replacement," which suggests that the white population is being deliberately edged out by nonwhite people.
That rhetoric was also echoed during the 2017 white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va., when marchers chanted "you will not replace us," and in the rambling manifesto written by the terrorist who killed more than 50 people in attacks on mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, last spring.
Last month the Justice Department also identified and disrupted three white supremacist domestic terrorists who were members of a group called the Base, which seeks to spark a race war and create a white ethno-state.
In court documents filed on Thursday in El Paso, prosecutors allege that Mr. Crusius bought the semiautomatic rifle he used in the attack, along with 1,000 rounds of hollow-point ammunition, on the internet.
The suspect drove nearly 10 hours overnight from his home in Allen, in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, to the Walmart in El Paso, they said. After uploading his manifesto online, the documents said, the suspect opened fire, first outside the store and then inside.
Mark Stevens, a lawyer representing the defendant, did not return a phone call seeking comment.
Mr. Crusius was indicted in September on a state charge of capital murder, a crime in Texas that is punishable by death or life in prison without parole. State prosecutors vowed to seek the death penalty.
The same potential punishment exists under the federal charges. Officials said Mr. Barr will decide later whether to seek the death penalty. The attorney general has been a proponent of the death penalty and has sought to resume federal executions, but plans to execute current death row inmates have been held up in the courts.

Texto completo: The new reforms will give the same amount of leave to both parents, regardless of their gender, a move the government said promotes gender equality and inclusivity.
Parents in Finland will be given the same amount of parental leave, regardless of their gender or whether they are a child's biological parents, the government announced.
The changes, which were announced Wednesday and could come into effect as early as 2021, are a bid to promote gender equality and inclusivity for same-sex couples and to encourage fathers to take as much time off work as mothers.
The measure is one of the latest reforms under Finland's new government, led by Sanna Marin, a progressive prime minister who took up the post late last year. Ms. Marin made news when she took up the post late last year becoming the world's youngest premier and heading a coalition government made up of all female leaders.
Under the new reforms, each parent will be allowed 164 days of paid parental leave, which increased the total allowance for a couple from 11.5 months to more than 14 months, the government said in a statement. Single parents will have the right to use the parental leave quotas of both parents.
The minister of social affairs and health, Aino-Kaisa Pekonen, said that the new policy shows the government's "investment in the future of children" and in the well-being of families.
"The reform will be a major change in attitudes, as it will improve equality between parents and make the lives of diverse families easier," she added.
But some industry and labor leaders seemed wary about the changes. Ilkka Oksala, di­rec­tor of work and social af­fairs of the Confederation of Finnish Industries, the largest employer's association in the country, criticized the new policy.
"The reform does not improve equality, it does not improve employment, and it does not improve women's position in the labor market," Mr. Oksala told Helsingin Sanomat, a Finnish daily newspaper.
Lotta Savinko, the head of labor affairs of Akava, a confederation of unions of professional and managerial staff in Finland, told the same newspaper that "the fact that the child home care allowance is not touched is a real problem."
Experts said that though the parental leave revisions had been long in the making, Ms. Marin may have been key to finally pushing the policy forward.
"Sanna Marin does represent change and her values on politics and policies are in alignment with the new parental leave model," Elina Penttinen, a gender studies professor at the University of Helsinki, said over email on Thursday.
Ms. Marin is a mother to a young daughter and has previously described herself as part of a "rainbow family." Her parents separated when she was a child, and she was raised by her mother and her mother's female partner. She has long been an advocate for progressive policies aimed at supporting families of all kinds.
Ms. Pekonen said that the reform will bring "a major change in attitudes" and "make the lives of diverse families easier."
"The reform will support all kinds of families and ensure equal leaves for children regardless of the form of the family," she said.
The new government policy will apply to all parents, regardless of gender or whether they are a child's biological or adoptive parents, and parents can transfer up to 69 days of their own leave to their partner.
Many European governments have introduced their own measures to combat the continent's low birthrates by incentivizing births, including Hungary, which recently announced plans to provide free in vitro fertilization for married men and women at clinics run by the state.
But Finland is an outlier as it maintains that the changes are aimed at tackling gender inequality by abolishing gender-specific benefits and using gender-neutral language in the legislation.
Many Finnish social media users applauded the government's efforts on social media after the measures were announced on Wednesday.
"I never felt that family leaves are also for us rainbow families," Minna Minkkinen wrote in a tweet, pointing to the fact that the new reforms provide better inclusion of same-sex couples. "I was moved."
Hanna Markkanen said that it was a step toward a "family-friend Finland."
"I'm particularly glad that multiple types of families are considered in the reform," she said.
Ms. Penttinen, the gender studies professor, said it had previously been "financially challenging for fathers to stay at home as they still received higher wages than women," but hoped that this reform would make way for improved work opportunities for women.
"In the long run, this might also change perception on hiring women as they have equal opportunity to advance their careers and return to work," she said.
The reform puts Finland well ahead of some other European countries in regards to the length of paternity leave. In Luxembourg, fathers can take just 10 days of paid leave "due to extraordinary circumstances," while in the Netherlands they are entitled to a total of five days, according to the European Parliament. But Finland's parental leave policies are still not as generous as neighboring Sweden, where each parent can take up to 240 days paid leave.
The United States has yet to introduce federally mandated paid parental leave.

Texto completo: Our guide to stand-up, improv and variety shows happening this weekend and in the week ahead.
'JENA FRIEDMAN: MISCARRIAGE OF JUSTICE' at Union Hall (Feb. 9, 5 p.m.). A former producer for "The Daily Show With Jon Stewart," this comedian stepped out in front of the camera for her own surreal docucomedy series for Adult Swim called "Soft Focus With Jena Friedman." It featured focus groups in which Friedman challenged men on their attitudes about sex and interviews with the likes of John McAfee and the so-called Cannibal Cop. Her stand-up is similarly provocative and political. Find out if she still has any hope for herself or the rest of us.

NEMR at Gramercy Theater (Feb. 8, 7:30 and 10:30 p.m.). This comedian, whose full name is Nemr Abou Nassar, grew up in San Diego, but then, at the age of 10, moved back with his family to Lebanon, where he went on to help introduce Americanized stand-up to the Middle East in the early 2000s. He eventually returned to the States with his brand of comedy and in 2017 scored a Showtime special, "No Bombing in Beirut."

MARK NORMAND at Gotham Comedy Club (Feb. 7-8, 8 and 10 p.m.). How many comedians can say they've received a shout-out from Jerry Seinfeld during the broadcast of a 2019 Mets game? Only Normand can. The comedian, originally from New Orleans and a resident of New York since 2007, had another A-lister, Amy Schumer, in his corner for his 2017 Comedy Central special, "Don't Be Yourself." This weekend, he headlines one of the city's most venerable comedy clubs.

'NATE' at Improv Asylum (Feb. 11-13, 7:30 p.m.; through Feb. 16). In case you missed it last year, Natalie Palamides's gender-bending take on toxic masculinity returns for a six-night run at this club in Chelsea. Jason Zinoman wrote in The New York Times that "Nate" is "a startlingly unusual creation -- a clown show about consent that managed to be funny and ferocious, broad and nuanced, a prank on the audience that felt like a tickle." The character Palamides has created for this one-hander is a far cry from the family-friendly, demure one she portrays on Progressive commercials.
212-203-5435, improvasylum.com
WHITMER THOMAS at the Bell House (Feb. 10, 7:30 p.m.). As an actor, Thomas has appeared on two episodes of the Netflix series "Glow," as well as in the 2019 movie "Sword of Trust." As a comedian, he has opened for Bo Burnham, who is the executive producer for Thomas's first HBO special, "Whitmer Thomas: The Golden One." This concert film and documentary premieres on Feb. 22.

'TIM AND ERIC: 2020 MANDATORY ATTENDANCE WORLD TOUR' at the Town Hall (Feb. 12, 8 p.m.). Tim Heidecker and Eric Wareheim have succeeded on their own in supporting roles -- Heidecker in Jordan Peele's "Us" and Wareheim on Netflix's "Master of None" -- but they're best known for their subversive late-night exploits on Adult Swim. They're returning to TV later this year for a multicamera-sitcom spoof called "Beef House," and hitting the road beforehand with a live tour. Their performance at Kings Theater in Brooklyn on Tuesday has sold out, but luckily tickets to this Midtown stop are still available.

Texto completo: Our guide to the city's best classical music and opera happening this weekend and in the week ahead.
DANISH STRING QUARTET at Alice Tully Hall (Feb. 7, 7:30 p.m.; Feb. 9, 5 p.m.; Feb. 11, 7:30 p.m.; through Feb. 18). "No quartet playing today has the Danish's way with late Beethoven," I wrote when naming this quartet's most recent release as one of the best recordings of 2019. These concerts will more than likely bear that assessment out not just in terms of late Beethoven, but of his early work, too. Starting a complete survey of the Beethoven quartets that spans six concerts in the space of two weeks, these three young Danes and their Norwegian cellist play the first three Op. 18 quartets on Friday, the second three on Sunday and the "Razumovsky" quartets on Tuesday.

SIMONE DINNERSTEIN at Miller Theater (Feb. 13, 8 p.m.). In this second concert of a three-part all-Bach series that Dinnerstein has curated, she is at the piano for the Keyboard Concerto No. 1, the Brandenburg Concerto No. 5 and an arrangement of "Erbarm dich mein, o Herre Gott." She performs all that with the Baroklyn ensemble, which also plays the Orchestral Suite No. 2.
212-854-7799, millertheatre.com
NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC at the Appel Room (Feb. 10, 7:30 p.m.) and David Geffen Hall (Feb. 13, 7:30 p.m.; through Feb. 18). The Philharmonic's valuable Project 19, which has commissioned 19 women composers in celebration of the centenary of the 19th Amendment, gets fully into its stride with premieres of pieces by Nicole Lizée, Joan La Barbara and Paola Prestini appearing in a Sound ON concert on Monday, and Tania Léon's "Stride" accompanying the Brahms Violin Concerto and the suite from Strauss's "Der Rosenkavalier" in subscription concerts starting later in the coming week. Jaap van Zweden conducts those, with Janine Jansen as the soloist.

ORPHEUS CHAMBER ORCHESTRA at the 92nd Street Y (Feb. 9, 3 p.m.). Never mind Mendelssohn's Octet, this concert deserves attention for its revival of the Nonet of Louise Farrenc, dating to 1849, a piece that shows the best of its remarkably fine composer, who taught at the Paris Conservatory and whose music is due for a revival. Also at the Y, Alexi Kenney performs a clever program of solo violin works by Bach and composers as diverse as Reich, Kurtag and Saariaho (Friday, 9 p.m.), and Sasha Cooke sings Schumann's "Kerner Lieder" and "Frauenliebe und -leben" (Feb. 13, 7:30 p.m.).
212-415-5500, 92y.org
STILE ANTICO at Corpus Christi Church (Feb. 9, 4 p.m.). Appearing as part of the Music Before 1800 series, this extraordinarily thoughtful and accomplished British vocal ensemble sings music "by and for Renaissance women," including compositions by Raffaella Aleotti, Leonora d'Este and Maddalena Casulana and works commissioned by female sovereigns such as Queen Mary I and Queen Elizabeth I from Tallis, Sheppard, Byrd and others.

Texto completo: The 1951 movie, which stars Ava Gardner and James Mason, has been digitally restored to sensational effect.
Albert Lewin's gloriously Technicolor modern myth "Pandora and the Flying Dutchman" is almost unique -- a staid yet outlandish star-vehicle that is also an exercise in by the book surrealism.
The movie, which stars Ava Gardner and James Mason in the title roles, is at the Quad Cinema, digitally restored to sensational effect. A more transgressive surrealist like Luis Buñuel might have found "Pandora" hilariously sanctimonious but it casts a spell just the same.
Based on the legend that inspired Wagner's "Flying Dutchman," "Pandora" has the doomed-to-wander sea captain cast anchor off the coast of a picturesque Spanish town, circa 1930. On shore and mad with desire, the men of the expat community are metaphorically sipping champagne from the slipper of the Indiana-born American singer, Pandora Reynolds (Gardner).
One hapless suitor kills himself, another demonstrates his adoration by pushing a beloved racing car off a cliff. Moments after agreeing to marriage, Pandora spots the mysterious yacht and impetuously dives into the sea. Swimming nude to the boat, she discovers its sole occupant, a dourly enigmatic Dutchman (James Mason), painting her portrait.
An arrogant matador (Mario Cabré, a former torero who had an onset affair with Gardner) further complicates the plot as the various love stories unfold amid a clutter of surrealist bric-a-brac -- disembodied hands entwined in a tangled fisherman's net, a racing car speeding past a headless Greek statue, a geometric chess set designed by Lewin's friend Man Ray (who also painted Gardner's portrait).
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Lewin, an MGM producer who took a break from the epic "Quo Vadis" to make "Pandora," a movie he wrote as well as directed, was not only a serious art collector but an English major at Harvard. Matthew Arnold's "Dover Beach" and "The Rubaiyat" are among the movie's literary references. More evocative are the bullfights and Lost Generation shenanigans -- a madcap cabana party with men in evening attire and women wearing swimsuits dancing the Charleston by the sea -- seemingly cribbed from "The Sun Also Rises." Pandora is sister to Lady Brett Ashley (a role Gardner would play in the 1957 Hollywood version of the Hemingway novel).
None of this sat well with the movie's original critics. The closest to a mixed review was written by Howard Thompson in The New York Times. Thompson noted the "brilliance and invention" of the cinematography and name-checked the camera man Jack Cardiff, celebrated for his ravishing work in Michael Powell's "Black Narcissus" and "The Red Shoes."
"Pandora" has an abundance of local color (including one of the longest flamenco numbers in any movie without the name "Carmen" in its title) but color itself is a greater attraction. Gardner shows up at a bullfight wearing an outfit of seafoam green that is so intense it may as well be the only green in the movie or maybe the universe.
Reviewing "Pandora" on DVD in the Times, Dave Kehr felt the colors were off, noting "that pixels can't always restore what fading chemicals have taken away." In this new restoration they have.

Here to Help; How to Show You Care With Food

Texto completo: If you want to give someone a food gift to show you care, consider cooking for them, ordering a gift basket or delivery, or organizing a meal train.
Like it is with many cooks, food is my mother's love language.
As a child, I watched her make meals for people as they celebrated births, pushed through cancer, moved, or mourned, packing a pop-up basket with aluminum pans and zip-top bags. The dishes inside were always carefully calibrated to the recipient. Sometimes it was black beans and rice with gazpacho for a vegetarian friend, or simply roasted chicken and potatoes for a neighbor with colitis. Often it was a traditional Jewish comfort dish, like brisket or matzo ball soup, that she knew our family craved.
Food can't solve every problem. But delivering a homemade dish or edible gift to someone's door is a concrete response to the sometimes hard-to-answer question of "What can I do to help?"
In our digital age of apps and near-instant delivery services, there are many creative ways in which you can nourish people and make sure you're giving them something they actually want. And if you're the one who needs nourishing, you can suggest these same ideas to those close to you. Either way, here's how to show you care with food.
Cook, or freeze, for others
If you're cooking for other people, consider their needs first -- even if you're a seasoned cook who loves to experiment. Emily Weinstein, deputy food editor for The New York Times and editor of NYT Cooking, suggests putting yourself in the recipient's shoes. "Ask yourself, 'What's the brief, what's the need? And how can I meet it?"' Ms. Weinstein said.
She recommends making comfort foods with a twist, like lasagna, meatballs, chili, or lentil soup, all of which freeze and reheat well. Margaux Laskey, senior staff editor at NYT Cooking, said casseroles, meatloaf, quick breads, drop cookies, and cakes are also great ideas.
Of course, consider potential food allergies as well as dietary or religious restrictions. But also ask about special circumstances and space limits. You can cook a large-batch meal or portion foods individually using zip-top bags, containers, wax paper, or foil, letting people reheat small amounts when they're hungry. Clearly labeling instructions, delivering meals that are already hot, and bringing premade add-ons like salad dressing can help streamline preparing and serving, especially when your recipient isn't thinking about cooking. Both Ms. Weinstein and Ms. Laskey recommend labeling your containers if you want them back.
If you're freezing dishes, do your best to remove air and wrap them tightly with freezer-weight packaging. (Wirecutter recommends glass Pyrex containers, plastic Snapware, or Rubbermaid TakeAlongs for food storage.)
Elizabeth Andress, food safety specialist and professor at the University of Georgia, said freezer-specific packaging really does make a difference in preventing freezer burn. For ingredient-specific freezing advice, she recommends consulting the guidelines from the National Center for Home Food Preservation.
You might also consider making something surprising and delightful that goes beyond basic sustenance. Laskey's go-to gift for new parents is a batch of frozen cookie dough, wrapped in individual servings so they can bake just a few cookies at a time.
It doesn't matter if you're not an experienced cook, said Ms. Weinstein. "I really can't emphasize this enough," she said. "It's just that you took the moment to think of somebody." Bringing something you didn't make yourself, like a bag of granola, an excellent hot sauce, or a rotisserie chicken from your local grocery store, is still appreciated.
Organize a meal train
Perhaps you aren't the only person looking to help your friend or loved one. In that case, you can organize a meal train -- a group of people who agree to feed someone on different days or during particular weeks -- to avoid duplicate dishes or an overloaded fridge.
Wirecutter recommends MealTrain.com, a dedicated crowdsourcing platform that makes coordinating drop-offs and specific meals easier. (A spreadsheet, email chain, or other sign-up website can work too). Mealtrain.com builds an interactive calendar and lets you customize the number of recipients, as well as their meal preferences and allergies.
The same rules apply to a meal train: Think about the recipient's needs, inquire about available space, and label your containers if you want them back.
Give a gift basket that's actually good
Whether your friend or loved one is sick, in mourning, or freshly moved into a new home, getting an edible treat in the mail is a welcome break from the usual bills and circulars. Wirecutter has recommendations for gift baskets that go beyond bland fruit-and-nut assortments. Before you buy, consider any dietary constraints, how long the items might last, and how many people the gift is for. For example, a sampler of Jeni's ice cream keeps well in the freezer, whereas a Jasper Hill Farms cheese basket offers a nosh for visitors but won't hold up longer than a few weeks.
You can also send over tea or coffee for a much-needed caffeine boost. On-the-go options, like instant coffee or tea, may be better for people who are working, traveling, or camping out at a hospital. (We like Mount Hagen Organic Single Serve Instant Coffee.) If you know your recipients are staying home, you can pair loose-leaf tea with a fine-meshed steeper or send over a box of great coffee. Wirecutter stocks Harney & Sons teas in our test kitchen and recommends the Finum Brewing Basket for steeping.
Delivery when they want it
Sometimes the best gift is giving people exactly what they want, when they want it. You can purchase gift cards for food delivery services like GrubHub and Uber Eats or pick one up from a local restaurant. That way, people can get takeout on their own time frame. Alternatively, you can place an order yourself so that it arrives at their door at just the right time.
If people can still cook but aren't able to shop for themselves, you could also ask for their grocery list and send them what they need through a delivery service like Instacart or FreshDirect. Another creative idea is a gift card for a meal kit service: Wirecutter recommends Blue Apron, which offers approachable recipes for beginners and provides all necessary ingredients except for salt, pepper, and oil. (It has vegetarian options too.)
Again, you don't want your gift to make things more difficult, so check in with your friend or family member beforehand to find out whether they're really up for cooking.
What you do for others, you can do for yourself
If you're going through a tough time of your own and people are pestering you about how they can help, offer up these ideas yourself. Don't be afraid of breaking a taboo by asking for what you want or need. You're giving people a purpose and can return the favor later on.

Texto completo: The statement came about a week after initial reports that the United States believed it had killed Qassim al-Rimi, the Qaeda leader in Yemen.
WASHINGTON -- The United States killed the leader of Al Qaeda's affiliate in Yemen, the White House confirmed on Thursday.
The confirmation came about a week after The New York Times first reported that the United States believed it had killed Qassim al-Rimi, the Qaeda leader, in January after months of tracing him.
The C.I.A. carried out the airstrike using an unmanned drone, an intelligence official said.
The White House statement had little detail about the operation, but said it was carried out at the direction of President Trump. The statement said Mr. al-Rimi's death will degrade the Yemen affiliate and the global Qaeda movement and "brings us closer to eliminating the threats these groups pose to our national security."
Mr. Trump has highlighted his record of ordering the killing of terrorist leaders and other adversaries. In his State of the Union address, he highlighted the Army Delta Force raid that killed Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the Islamic State leader, as well as the drone strike in Baghdad that killed Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, Iran's most important general.
Mr. al-Rimi was one of the founders of Yemen's Qaeda affiliate. Although the affiliate's power and ability to conduct strikes in the West has diminished under the pressure of strikes by the American military and C.I.A. aircraft, it is still one of the world's most potent forces.
It remains to be seen how much Mr. al-Rimi's death will set the group back.
The C.I.A. learned of Mr. al-Rimi's location from an informer in Yemen last November, allowing the government to begin tracking him with surveillance drones, an official said.
Mr. al-Rimi, 41, was among the few remaining Qaeda leaders whose terrorist pedigree traces to the era before the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.

Texto completo: We checked misleading statements that President Trump made about his trial, his political enemies and his own record.
President Trump celebrated his acquittal by the Senate in meandering remarks made on Thursday, when he recited a familiar litany of falsehoods and misleading assertions about the impeachment trial against him, his political enemies and his own record. Here's a fact check.
"A corrupt politician named Adam Schiff made up my statement to the Ukrainian president. He brought it out of thin air. Just made it up."
This is exaggerated. For months, Mr. Trump has decried a re-enactment of his July 25 phone call with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, read aloud by Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California and the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee.
At a hearing in September, Mr. Schiff said he was conferring "the essence" of the conversation and later clarified that his summary of the call "was meant to be at least part in parody." But he spoke in first person, leaving the impression that he was quoting Mr. Trump.
On Thursday, Mr. Trump took particular umbrage at one of Mr. Schiff's erroneous lines in the parody: "By the way, don't call me again. I'll call you when you've done what I asked." According to the reconstructed transcript of the call, Mr. Trump said the opposite to Mr. Zelensky: "Whenever you would like to come to the White House, feel free to call."
But while Mr. Schiff's account at points veered from the transcript in chronology and details, it generally tracked with the transcript's version of what Mr. Trump said on the call (for example, his description of Mr. Zelensky's interest in a meeting and purchasing weapons, and Mr. Trump's asking for a "favor"). It was not fabricated "out of thin air."
"They said they didn't add this word. I said, 'Add it, they're probably wrong, but add it.' So now everyone agrees that they were perfectly accurate."
This is exaggerated. Mr. Trump was referring inaccurately to testimony from Lt. Col. Alexander S. Vindman, the top Ukraine expert on the National Security Council who heard Mr. Trump's call with Mr. Zelensky. Colonel Vindman said that the reconstructed transcript included a few omissions, and that he had tried to make some changes. Some edits were successful, he said, but two "substantive" corrections were not made.
On the fourth page of the transcript, Mr. Trump said former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. "went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into that ..."
According to his notes, Colonel Vindman said, the ellipses took the place of Mr. Trump saying "there are recordings."
On that same page, the transcript recorded Mr. Zelensky promising that Ukraine's next prosecutor general would "look into the situation, specifically to the company that you mentioned in this issue."
But Mr. Zelensky explicitly said Burisma, the Ukrainian gas company where Mr. Biden's son worked, and not "the company," according to Colonel Vindman.
"I think that's when Comey announced he was leaking, lying and everything else, right?"
False. As Mr. Trump praised Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, he claimed that Mr. Grassley's questioning of James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director, in May 2017 resulted in Mr. Comey confessing to the misdeeds Mr. Trump has long accused him of. But Mr. Comey had said the exact opposite, denying that he had leaked classified information:
Mr. Grassley: "Director Comey, have you ever been an anonymous source in news reports about matters relating to the Trump investigation or the Clinton investigation?"

Mr. Comey: "Never."

Mr. Grassley: "Question two, relatively related, have you ever authorized someone else at the F.B.I. to be an anonymous source in news reports about the Trump investigation or the Clinton investigation?"

Mr. Comey "No."

Mr. Grassley: "Has any classified information relating to President Trump or his association -- associates been declassified and shared with the media?"

Mr. Comey: "Not to my knowledge."
"Tell me, why isn't Germany paying money? Why isn't France? Why isn't United Kingdom paying money? Why aren't they paying money? Why are we paying the money?"
This is misleading. Mr. Trump was talking about international aid to Ukraine. Those European countries are, in fact, contributing to Ukraine's efforts to counteract Russian aggression. They provide more development and humanitarian aid to Ukraine than the United States does, though the United States is the largest provider of military assistance.
European countries have contributed $ 1.6 billion in development assistance from 2014 to 2017, compared with $ 807 million from the United States, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.
"We just won two seats in North Carolina, two wonderful seats in North Carolina that were not supposed to be won."
This is exaggerated. Two Republicans, Representatives Dan Bishop and Greg Murphy, won their special House elections in September. Contrary to Mr. Trump's claim that his party pulled off upset victories, both districts were conservative strongholds.
Republicans have held Mr. Bishop's district, North Carolina's Ninth, since the 1960s. Mr. Murphy won his seat after the February 2019 death of Walter B. Jones Jr., a Republican who had represented the Third District since 1995. Mr. Trump carried both congressional districts by wide margins of 12 percent and 24 percent.
"We are putting up walls in New Mexico, too; a state that has never been in play for Republicans is totally in play, right?"
This is exaggerated. Mr. Trump has a point that the state has largely voted for Democratic presidential candidates in the past two decades, but he goes too far to say it has "never been in play for Republicans."
Since New Mexico became a state in 1912, it voted for 15 Democratic presidential candidates and 12 Republican candidates, most recently George W. Bush in 2004. According to the University of Virginia's Center for Politics, the state currently leans Democratic for the 2020 presidential election.
"Matt said, like five years ago, six years ago, and I made a speech. And then they do some kind of a straw poll. Who made the best speech? And he said I made the best speech."
False. Mr. Trump was addressing Matt Schlapp, the chairman of the American Conservative Union, which hosts the annual Conservative Political Action Conference. But he had never won the straw poll at CPAC before he became president.
Ron Paul, the libertarian and former Texas congressman, won in 2011, and Mr. Trump, a write-in candidate who received about 1 percent of the votes, did not crack the top 15. Senator Mitt Romney of Utah won in 2012; Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky in 2013, 2014 (Mr. Trump tied for 14th place) and 2015 (Mr. Trump came in eighth place); and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas in 2016 (Mr. Trump came in third).
CPAC retired the poll for 2017 and 2018, but Mr. Trump did come in first place in 2019 with 82 percent of the votes, with Mr. Romney trailing in second at 6 percent.
"We had first time in 51 years where drug prices actually came down last year, first time in 51 years."
This is misleading. The Consumer Price Index for prescription drugs has declined under Mr. Trump, most recently in September. But that measure does not include all prescription drugs. Nor was it the "first time in 51 years" that the index had declined -- it did so as well in December 2013, under the Obama administration. And it has risen since September.
Other analyses show that drug prices have continued to rise, albeit at a slower rate than in the past. GoodRx, a website that tracks costs, has found that 639 drugs have so far increased by an average of 6 percent. That's in line with other surveys from 3 Axis Advisors, a consultancy firm that estimated an average rise of 5.3 percent this year, and Rx Savings Solutions, a company that advises employers on how to reduce drug costs, which found an average 6.9 percent increase on more than 2,500 drugs.

Shaken by Trump's Acquittal, Democrats Ask, What Do We Do Next?

Texto completo: With impeachment behind them, House Democrats must determine how to balance their policy agenda with a determination to continue investigating President Trump.
WASHINGTON -- House Democrats, back on their heels after President Trump's acquittal of impeachment charges, wrestled on Thursday with a question that could determine their party's fate in November: Now what?
As Mr. Trump took an ostentatious victory lap at the White House, Democrats were grappling with how to balance their policy agenda and their determination to continue aggressive investigations of a president they view as a threat to the country.
With just five months left in the legislative year and nine before the elections, Democrats concede they have to make some tough decisions.
"It's something we need to talk about," said Representative John Yarmuth, Democrat of Kentucky and the chairman of the House Budget Committee. He said that the issue came up during the weekly closed-door meeting of committee leaders.
Democrats believe they won back the House majority in 2018 with a laser focus on health care and the economy. But they are also revolted by an unrepentant president and reluctant to abandon investigations into his conduct that might yield evidence of wrongdoing. With Mr. Trump emboldened by his acquittal, some say investigating him is more important than ever.
Speaker Nancy Pelosi seemed ready to make a pivot on Thursday, less than 24 hours after the Senate verdict that he was not guilty ended a five-month impeachment drama that consumed the Capitol.
At her weekly news conference, Ms. Pelosi spent the bulk of her opening remarks talking about Mr. Trump's State of the Union address -- "appalling," she said -- and pushing back on his claims that he is responsible for the nation's economic turnaround.
But she also vowed not to let up on oversight of his policies and personal conduct.
"We will continue to do our oversight to protect and defend the Constitution," Ms. Pelosi said.
Putting that into practice may prove fraught. Democratic leaders must decide in the coming days whether to carry on with the investigation into Mr. Trump's effort to pressure Ukraine to investigate his political rivals, which led the House to impeach the president on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.
The biggest question at the moment is whether to issue a subpoena for John R. Bolton, the former national security adviser, after senators refused to consider new testimony in the impeachment trial. Doing so could yield damaging new information, but it also risks making Democrats look like sore losers.
On Wednesday, Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York, the Judiciary Committee chairman and an impeachment manager, said that the House should subpoena Mr. Bolton, who has written a tell-all book that contains a direct account of Mr. Trump's decision to leverage nearly $ 400 million in military aid for Ukraine in exchange for the investigations.
But Democrats also recognize that Mr. Bolton may be less receptive to speaking to the House now that Mr. Trump has been acquitted. On Thursday, Neither Ms. Pelosi nor Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the House Intelligence Committee chairman and the leader of the impeachment prosecution team, would say what they intend to do.
"We really haven't made any decisions yet," Mr. Schiff said.
Some of the Democrats' long-running investigations into Mr. Trump are continuing quietly, and others are proceeding in the federal courts, where the House is party to a handful of consequential legal fights over access to Mr. Trump's tax returns, other financial information and witness testimony and documents related to Robert S. Mueller III's Russia investigation.
Several of the fights could go to the Supreme Court and perhaps be decided before November's elections. If Democrats were to win access, say, to Mr. Trump's federal tax returns, or a court forced Donald F. McGahn II, the former White House counsel, to testify about Mr. Trump's attempts to thwart the Russia investigation, it could produce a new round of high-profile hearings about whether the president had broken the law -- an inquiry that would surely reverberate in the presidential campaign.
Lower-profile work by the House Oversight and Reform, Judiciary and Foreign Affairs committees has scrutinized the Trump administration's border policies, the decision to include a citizenship question on the 2020 census, politicization of the State Department and the responses to devastating hurricanes in the Caribbean.
But the question is one of emphasis, and how Democrats answer it could shape voters' views of them heading into the next election. Representative Donna Shalala, Democrat of Florida, who served as health secretary to President Bill Clinton, repeated a single phrase when asked what Democrats should do next.
"Health care, health care, health care," said Ms. Shalala, who is working on legislation to lower the cost of prescription drugs and to end surprise medical billing.
As is the case with most intraparty Democratic debates, moderates and progressives fall into different camps. Moderates want to talk to voters about "kitchen table" issues. Progressives want to send the message that the House will continue to act as a check on a president clearly emboldened by his acquittal.
"People in Wisconsin, people in Michigan, people in Ohio, people in Pennsylvania, people in North Carolina, they're going to vote for their member of Congress or a president based on what that party is focused on," said Representative Tim Ryan, a centrist Democrat from Ohio. "They are focused on their own economic situation. They will punish a party that is not focused on those issues."
But progressives like Representatives Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Jamie Raskin of Maryland said that Democrats should redouble their efforts to rein in Mr. Trump.
"We must make sure that this administration does not continue to break the law," Ms. Omar said.
Mr. Raskin framed it this way: "We have the exact same oversight duties and powers as we did before. He also has not won himself the right to commit high crimes and misdemeanors against the Constitution and the people."
Even so, there were signs on Thursday that the House's marquee inquiries will shift into a lower gear. Norman L. Eisen and Barry H. Berke, who served as special counsels to the Judiciary Committee for its long-running abuse of power investigation and then formed part of its core impeachment team, are both expected to depart in the coming weeks.
The internal discussion over next steps comes as the relationship between Mr. Trump and Ms. Pelosi has hit a new low, raising questions about whether it is even possible for them to work together on legislative matters. Both the president and the speaker have said that they want legislation to lower the cost of prescription drugs and to fix the nation's crumbling infrastructure.
But if the events of Thursday were any guide, they can barely stand to be in the same room with one another. At a White House celebration of his acquittal, Mr. Trump boasted about having taken a shot at Ms. Pelosi during the National Prayer Breakfast earlier that day.
"I had Nancy Pelosi sitting four seats away, and I said things that a lot of people wouldn't have said," Mr. Trump said. "But I meant every one of them."
At the Capitol, Ms. Pelosi shot back, saying Mr. Trump looked "a little sedated" at the State of the Union. "That was not a State of the Union," she said. "That was his state of his mind."
As Democrats contemplated the road ahead, Republicans were giddy, portraying the House's failed impeachment case as a misguided overreach.
Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, called impeachment "a colossal political mistake." Americans, he said, "are more likely to focus at this point and for the rest of the year on, what kind of shape is the country in? How are you feeling about things? Are you better off now than you were four years ago?"

Texto completo: The Korean phenomenon may become the first non-English language film to win the Oscar for best picture. Here's a look at the previous nominees that lost.
"Parasite," the scathing comedy-thriller from Bong Joon Ho, has steadily been making history.
Last year, it became the first South Korean movie to win the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival. Last month, it was nominated for six Oscars, including best picture, best international feature (formerly known as best foreign-language film) and best director, all three of which were firsts for South Korean cinema. Then "Parasite" became the first foreign-language film to take home the top Screen Actors Guild Award, for best cast in a motion picture.
The movie, about a poor family scheming its way into working for a wealthy family, has grossed more than $ 160 million worldwide, and talks about a limited series adaptation for HBO are already underway.
But will it become the first foreign-language film to win the Oscar for best picture?
Awards-season experts say it has a good chance, but among other factors, it will have to overcome academy history. Only 10 other foreign-language films have been nominated for its top prize. Despite rave reviews and box office successes, none of them could break the English language barrier. Here's a look at those ten.
'Grand Illusion'

Nominated in 1938, this French World War I drama from Jean Renoir was the first foreign-language film to land a best-picture nod. It centers on two French officers captured by a German pilot and held in a prisoner-of-war camp.
Critics consider "Grand Illusion" one of the greatest movies ever made. Franklin D. Roosevelt argued that "all the democracies in the world must see this film," while Orson Welles once said: "If I had only one film in the world to save, it would be 'Grand Illusion."'
The academy would have chosen otherwise. The movie lost to Frank Capra's romantic comedy, "You Can't Take It With You."
'Z'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
This political thriller by the Greek-French director Costa-Gavras is the first of only six films to be nominated for both best picture and best foreign-language film.
"Z" draws from a true story and follows an investigator looking into the murder of a left-wing politician in Greece. It was released in several European countries in 1969 -- the year it was nominated -- but was banned under the ruling military junta in Greece and would not screen there until after the junta fell in 1974.
It received five Oscar nominations, and went on to win two, for editing and foreign-language film. In the best picture category, "Z" lost to "Midnight Cowboy," John Schlesinger's X-rated drama starring Dustin Hoffman and Jon Voight.
'The Emigrants'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
This sprawling epic by the director Jan Troell follows a poor Swedish family on an arduous journey to Minnesota in the 19th century. The film led to a sequel, "The New Land," starring the same cast. A short-lived series on ABC followed.
"The Emigrants" was nominated for best foreign-language film in 1972. Because of different categories' eligibility rules, it received four more nominations in 1973, for best picture, director, actress and adapted screenplay.
It left both ceremonies empty-handed, losing to a very different immigrant story in the best picture category, "The Godfather."
'Cries and Whispers'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
The eminent director Ingmar Bergman directed this period drama set around the turn of the century about three sisters who reunite in 19th-century Sweden as one of them is dying of cancer.
The movie is said to be Bergman's most striking work in color. "All of my films can be thought of in terms of black and white," he once said, "except 'Cries and Whispers."'
It was nominated for five Oscars in 1973, including best director. But it just took home one, for best cinematography. The award for best picture went to George Roy Hill's caper, "The Sting," which scooped up seven Oscars in total.
'Il Postino'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Carried by the quiet yet touching performances of its two stars, Massimo Troisi and Philippe Noiret, this Italian dramedy chronicles the unlikely friendship between a mailman and his only client, the Chilean poet Pablo Neruda.
This was Troisi's last performance. He had put off heart surgery to work on the film and died of a heart attack the day after principal photography was completed.
The movie received five Oscar nominations in 1995 and walked away with one, for Luis Bacalov's score. "Braveheart" was deemed best picture.
'Life Is Beautiful'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
The Italian actor Roberto Benigni directed and starred in this tragicomedy, about an Italian Jew who is interned in a Nazi concentration camp but who convinces his son that the horrors around them are all part of a silly game.
The movie is now one of the highest-grossing non-English language films in American box office history. It was nominated for seven Oscars in 1998, including best director and best screenplay. It won three, for best actor, original score and foreign-language film.
The romantic comedy "Shakespeare in Love" won best picture.
'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Ang Lee's martial arts epic, about two lovers on the hunt for a stolen sword in 19th-century China, brought in more than $ 128 million at the domestic box office when it opened 20 years ago. The film featured dizzying choreography by Yuen Woo-ping of "The Matrix" and music by Yo-Yo Ma.
In 2000, "Crouching Tiger" became the first foreign-language film to land 10 Oscar nominations. Lee lost in the best-director category, but his picture won four awards, for cinematography, score, set direction and foreign-language film.
The best picture Oscar went to another historical epic, "Gladiator."
'Letters from Iwo Jima'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
This war drama from Clint Eastwood reimagined the 1945 Battle of Iwo Jima from the perspective of Japanese soldiers. Primarily in Japanese, the film was a companion piece to Eastwood's "Flags of Our Fathers," which looked at the battle through the eyes of the Americans.
Several critics said "Letters from Iwo Jima" was the best movie of the year. It won a Golden Globe for best foreign-language film and, in 2006, was nominated for four Oscars, including best director and original screenplay. It took home one, for sound editing.
Martin Scorsese's "The Departed" won best picture.
'Amour'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
In this tragic French-language drama from the Austrian filmmaker Michael Haneke, the quiet life of a retired couple in Paris is turned upside down after the wife suffers a stroke.
"Amour" won the Palme d'Or at Cannes, and the New York Times critic A.O. Scott named it the best movie of 2012. It received five Oscar nods, among them best directing and original screenplay. But it walked away with only one award, for best foreign-language film.
"Argo," the historical thriller starring and directed by Ben Affleck, was named best picture.
'Roma'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Alfonso Cuarón's black-and-white portrait of life in 1970s Mexico City made waves last year.
It became the second foreign-language film with 10 Oscar nominations after "Crouching Tiger" -- among the nods were best actress and original screenplay -- and the movie gave Netflix its first best-picture nomination.
It ultimately won three groundbreaking Oscars: "Roma" gave Mexico its first win in the foreign-language film category; Cuarón was the first person to win both best cinematography and directing for the same film; and he was the first to win best director for a movie that wasn't in English.
Yet when it came to best picture, "Roma" lost to "Green Book," Peter Farrelly's polarizing segregation-era tale.

Texto completo: Several current and former Trump advisers gathered to mingle and toast the president's acquittal in the Senate.
WASHINGTON -- Well, where else were they going to go?
One mile from the scene of President Trump's acquittal in his impeachment trial, members of his defense team, family and administration gathered Wednesday evening at the Trump International Hotel in downtown Washington. They turned its marbled lobby into something of a hive bursting with "Keep America Great" hats, well-done steaks and bottles of red wine.
"I think it's clearly a validation of the fact that the president never committed a crime," Corey Lewandowski, the president's former campaign manager, said as he flashed a blue piece of paper from his wallet. It was a Senate gallery ticket; he had watched the vote as it happened.
"We've had a very good week," Mr. Lewandowski said, "between the debacle in Iowa" -- referring to assorted fumbles that left the Democratic results in the 2020 caucuses in a state of suspended uncertainty -- "the State of the Union speech and then the acquittal of the impeachment proceedings."
Everyone else seemed to have gotten the message. Mr. Lewandowski was only one of several current and former Trump advisers who had gathered at the hotel to mingle and drink. On Tuesday, a photograph of an airplane full of Trump campaign surrogates returning from Iowa sailed around the internet. By Wednesday, roughly half them appeared to have passed through the hotel at some point to celebrate the verdict with plenty of booze and slightly bitter undertones.
It was a mood that mirrored the one on display by Mr. Trump, who has so far reflected on his victory by hitting back at Democrats on Twitter.
While the president stewed at the White House before a speech scheduled for noon on Thursday, his brethren arrived at the family property in slick black sport utility vehicles as the weather hit a drizzle.
Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law, arrived early in the evening, ducking into a side room with members of Mr. Trump's legal defense team, including Pat A. Cipollone and Jay Sekulow. Kellyanne Conway, the president's counselor, came and went. "They denigrate," she said. "We celebrate."
Donald Trump Jr. and Kimberly Guilfoyle, the ever-present campaign road warriors, also made an appearance, as did Hogan Gidley, a White House spokesman.
Past a certain hour, the drinks started flowing faster and the lobby turned into a who's who of fixtures in Mr. Trump's circle. At one table, Mr. Lewandowski held forth with Eric Bolling, a host for the Sinclair Broadcast Group. Mr. Bolling echoed some supporters by focusing on Senator Mitt Romney, Republican of Utah, whose vote to remove the president from office prevented Mr. Trump from being able to say his acquittal had been cast along purely party lines.
"Mitt Romney should be removed from all of his leadership roles and should consider switching parties," Mr. Bolling declared. When asked if he believed the president would fixate on Mr. Romney's decision, Mr. Bolling paused. "I hope not," he said.
This is often the best way to describe the atmosphere at even the best pro-Trump bash: celebratory, but with a palpable amount of spite. Sweet and bitter -- the Negroni, as it were, of Senate acquittals.
The perpetual hint of defiance that permeates a crowd like this was even more on display given that the hotel had been a regular gathering place for many of the figures involved in the impeachment proceedings. It was what Lev Parnas, a Soviet-born businessman who played an integral role in the campaign to pressure Ukraine to investigate Mr. Trump's political rivals, called "a breeding ground."
This, of course, did little to encourage Republicans to shift their support of the president, or the family business, throughout impeachment or otherwise. The Republican National Committee has paid more than $ 440,000 to the hotel since Mr. Trump was elected -- about 24,400 glasses of the hotel's house white wine. America First Action, a super PAC that supports Mr. Trump's causes, has spent $ 505,000 at the hotel since 2017.
As the evening unfolded, the party began to creep out into the open -- or at least to the steakhouse adjacent to the lobby. Ms. Guilfoyle and the younger Mr. Trump held court with a merry band of supporters, including Representative Matt Gaetz, Republican of Florida, who has dipped in and out -- and is presumably in again -- of the Trump fold. Even as he socialized with the president's family, Mr. Gaetz announced on Twitter that he had filed an ethics complaint against Speaker Nancy Pelosi for tearing up the president's State of the Union address.
"Nobody is above the law," he wrote. "She must be held accountable."
Against a wall stood Nigel Farage, the former leader of the U.K. Independence Party and one of the so-called Bad Boys of Brexit whose perpetual presence at the hotel suggests he should have a punch card.
Around 11 p.m., Mr. Sekulow strode through the lobby to say goodbye, pausing to take pictures with admirers. He had no comment for a reporter on his reaction to the acquittal, but a woman approached him as he left the hotel to provide her own assessment.
"You did great," she said.
Just behind her, another woman came outside and sniffed the air.
"Ugly night," she remarked to no one in particular as the celebrants departed.

Texto completo: Our guide to plays and musicals coming to New York stages and a few last-chance picks of shows that are about to close. Our reviews of open shows are at nytimes.com/reviews/theater .
Previews & Openings
'CHEKHOV/TOLSTOY: LOVE STORIES' at Theater Row (in previews; opens on Feb. 10). Will two great Russians' tales taste great together? The Mint Theater continues its relationship with the English playwright Miles Malleson, staging two of his adaptations: Chekhov's story of an artist and Tolstoy's tale of a peasant couple. Jonathan Bank and Jane Shaw direct a cast that includes Vinie Burrows.
212-239-6200, minttheater.org
'DANA H.' at the Vineyard Theater (previews start on Feb. 11; opens on Feb. 25). Lucas Hnath often writes about famous figures -- Isaac Newton, Walt Disney, Hillary Clinton. His subject this time: his own mother, Dana Higginbotham. Hnath adapted the play from interviews that were conducted with her about the time she was held captive by a psychiatric patient she ministered to as a chaplain at a mental institution. The Obie winner Diedre O'Connell brings the harrowing true story to life.
212-353-0303, vineyardtheatre.org
'DARLING GRENADINE' at the Roundabout Underground (in previews; opens on Feb. 10). A cocktail of a musical, Daniel Zaitchik's romantic comedy is about a guy, a girl, a friend, a dog and the ravages of addiction. Adam Kantor plays Harry, a composer, with Emily Walton as the chorus girl he loves and Jay Armstrong Johnson as a loyal friend. Michael Berresse directs.
212-719-1300, roundabouttheatre.org
'HAMLET' at St. Ann's Warehouse (in previews; opens on Feb. 10). Hamlet's inky cloak? Ruth Negga is wearing it now. The Ethiopian-Irish actress plays the prince in Yaël Farber's production of Shakespeare's tragedy. "It nearly killed me," she told The New York Times, describing an earlier run. Guess there's nothing like a Dane. With Aoife Duffin as Ophelia.
718-254-8779, stannswarehouse.org
'THE HEADLANDS' at the Claire Tow Theater (previews start on Feb. 8; opens on Feb. 24). A writer of puzzle-box plays, Christopher Chen ("Caught," "Passage") unspools a new mystery for LCT3. In this detective drama, directed by Knud Adams, a grown son, Henry (Aaron Yoo), pieces together memories to try to solve the murder of his father (Johnny Wu). Laura Kai Chen portrays Henry's mother in the past; Mia Katigbak, his present one.
212-239-6200, lct3.org
'HOT WING KING' at the Pershing Square Signature Center (previews start on Feb. 11; opens on March 1). A saucy comedy, Katori Hall's new play, part of her Signature Theater residency, unfolds during the Hot Wang Festival in Memphis, with family and romantic conflict cooking alongside the chicken. Steve H. Broadnax III directs a cast that includes Toussaint Jeanlouis and Korey Jackson.
212-244-7529, signaturetheatre.org
[ Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead. ]
'THE PERPLEXED' at New York City Center Stage I (previews start on Feb. 11; opens on March 3). Before Richard Greenberg goes to the ballgame with the Broadway revival of "Take Me Out," he premieres this uptown comedy about two families, alike in indignity, and the wedding that unites them. For Manhattan Theater Club, Lynne Meadow directs a cast that includes Margaret Colin and Frank Wood.
212-581-1212, nycitycenter.org
'72 MILES TO GO ...' at the Laura Pels Theater at the Harold and Miriam Steinberg Center for Theater (previews start on Feb. 13; opens on March 10). When Anita is deported -- from Tucson, Ariz., to Nogales, Mexico -- family life goes on with and without her. Hilary Bettis's border-crossing, decade-spanning drama stars Maria Elena Ramirez as Anita, with Triney Sandoval, Tyler Alvarez, Jacqueline Guillén and Bobby Moreno. Jo Bonney directs.
212-719-1300, roundabouttheatre.org
'SIX' at the Brooks Atkinson Theater (previews start on Feb. 13; opens on March 12). In a time before marriage counseling and no-fault divorce, the much-married Henry VIII racked up six wives. And in this rock musical by Toby Marlow and Lucy Moss, they come together to debate who had it worst. "'Six' delivers pure entertainment throughout its headlong 80 minutes," Jesse Green wrote of the Chicago production last summer.
877-250-2929, sixonbroadway.com
'THE UNSINKABLE MOLLY BROWN' at Abrons Arts Center (previews start on Feb. 8; opens on Feb. 26). Can the 1960 Meredith Willson musical about a Titanic survivor float? The book writer Dick Scanlan's update for the Transport Group pushes the show toward the actual history of the lifeboat queen Margaret Tobin Brown, played here by Beth Malone. Kathleen Marshall directs and choreographs the show's Off Broadway premiere.
866-811-4111, transportgroup.org
Last Chance
'AMERICAN UTOPIA' at the Hudson Theater (closes on Feb. 16). A knockout concert and an occasional meditation on civics and community, David Byrne's musical theater experience, choreographed by Annie-B Parson, drops its chain curtain for the final time. The erstwhile Talking Head frontman's show, Ben Brantley wrote, "repositions a onetime rebel as a reflective elder statesman, offering cozy cosmic wisdom."
855-801-5876, americanutopiabroadway.com
'TIMON OF ATHENS' at the Polonsky Shakespeare Center (closes on Feb. 9). Fashioned for this age of inequality, Simon Godwin's adaptation of Shakespeare's (and Thomas Middleton's) vexed semitragedy ends its run. Starring Kathryn Hunter as a plutocrat who goes broke, the production adds in fragments from other Shakespeare plays, plus a sonnet. Jesse Green called it an "energetic and somewhat Frankensteined revival."

Texto completo: Readers reflect on what was achieved, Mitt Romney's act of defiance and the meaning of acquittal.
To the Editor:
Re "Split Senate Clears Trump on Each Count in Finale of a Bitter Impeachment Battle" (front page, Feb. 6):
Well, it's finally over, and now come the analyses and the blowback from the White House. And what was accomplished by the impeachment effort? A lot, I think. Some good, some bad.
For one thing, the House Democratic leaders reminded us of who we are and what we are. Representative Adam Schiff's "Enough!" should echo through campaign ads all across the nation this fall.
The most consequential accomplishment of the impeachment effort, I think, is that it did exactly what President Trump tried to do by pressuring the president of Ukraine. It dragged Joe Biden's name through the mud, and that helps explain Mr. Biden's poor showing in Iowa. So Mr. Trump seems to have a clear shot at being re-elected.
But there's a silver lining. At least some of the G.O.P. members of Congress who live in fear of Mr. Trump and who turned their backs on the Constitution will not be returning to Washington, and we're likely to see Democratic majorities elected in both the House and the Senate.
George Moore
Elkins, W.Va.
To the Editor:
Thank you, Adam Schiff, Hakeem Jeffries, Val Demings, Zoe Lofgren, Jason Crow, Sylvia Garcia and Jerry Nadler. Thank you for your hard work as House impeachment managers over the many long days and nights of the proceedings. Thank you for heartfelt and inspiring words. And, most of all, thank you for your deep knowledge of and belief in democracy and the Constitution.
Thank you for reminding us that there are still people like you in Congress -- people of character who work every day to do what's right for our country. We now owe it to you to seek out and help elect more people like you in November.
Peggy Calkins
Gloucester, Mass.
To the Editor:
Thank goodness this ill-conceived debacle of an impeachment has come to its inevitable end. It should be clear now that the program of resistance aimed at toppling President Trump has failed. If anything it has made him stronger.
Let me suggest to the Democrats that the time has come to put aside your hatred of President Trump. That does not mean you should stop challenging him. By all means continue to challenge him, but challenge him in the arena of ideas. At the end of the day the party that succeeds will be the party that does the most to improve the lives of Americans.
William Priester
New York
To the Editor:
Let's remember that an acquittal does not mean the accused did not commit the offenses alleged, or suggest innocence, only that a jury -- for whatever reason, including the most shameless and self-serving -- failed to convict.
Tim O'Brien
Chiang Mai, Thailand
To the Editor:
Re "An Act of Defiance by Romney Against a Party He'd Personified" (front page, Feb. 6):
It is shocking for a senator of the United States to find it necessary to appear like a penitent schoolboy to explain his vote. It is alarming that currently many Americans seem eager to celebrate blind loyalty, and seek to punish those who exercise their rights to freedom of thought and speech. This is the path to tyranny.
I applaud Senator Mitt Romney for his courage, but I grieve that he felt it necessary to explain. It should not have been so.
Norma S. Gauster

Senator Mitt Romney said, "We're all footnotes at best in the annals of history." He is wrong. He is no footnote. It was easy for every Democrat to vote for President Trump's conviction, and it was easy for every Republican but him to vote to acquit. Both sides yielded to peer pressure and the herd mentality of their party. But Mr. Romney genuinely and unequivocally voted his conscience. He is no footnote. He is a shining light.

To the Editor:
Re "Republicans Clear Trump Out of Fear," by Senator Sherrod Brown (Op-Ed, Feb. 6):
Republican senators, you have hitched your wagon to a boat anchor, and he is dragging the G.O.P. to the bottom. President Trump is a self-centered bully and liar who has no regard for propriety, morality, truth, scientific facts, history or the conventions that make our democracy work. You surely know this, just as you know that his famous call to Ukraine's president was far from "perfect."
You found him innocent of the charges against him, yet I read that a number of you have serious concerns about his actions. Why not assert yourselves and express those concerns? Fifteen or so of you could band together and vote with Democrats to deliver a strong message of censure. Mr. Trump will bluster and tweet, but if you stick together, he will not hurt you, and history will note that the Senate had a spine and a moderate G.O.P. re-emerged on this day. How about it?

To the Editor:
Now that President Trump has been acquitted, he will have three priorities: his re-election campaign, his golf game and revenge.

Texto completo: Our guide to cultural events in New York City for children and teenagers happening this weekend and in the week ahead.
ANIMATION FIRST at the French Institute Alliance Française (Feb. 7-10). France has many notable exports, but animation doesn't usually spring immediately to mind. According to the institute, however, the nation is Europe's largest producer of this type of film, and this festival, now in its third year, will intrigue both young people -- those old enough to read subtitles -- and their parents. Highlights include the opening-night feature, "The Bears' Famous Invasion of Sicily," an adaptation by Lorenzo Mattotti of a children's book involving some bear-human conflict (and resolution). An all-ages party will follow. On Saturday, junior cineastes can enjoy Anne-Lise Koehler and Éric Serre's "Hello World!," an ecological story whose myriad animals are papier-mâché puppets, and "The Prince's Voyage," a hand-drawn chronicle of a monkey's adventure that will be introduced by its director, Jean-François Laguionie. Sunday brings "Marona's Fantastic Tale," about the peripatetic life of a Labrador mix; the film's director, Anca Damian, will do a post-screening Q. and A. The festival will also offer video games, virtual reality experiences and titles for those hardest-to-please moviegoers, teenagers.
212-355-6160, fiaf.org
BROADWAY PLAYHOUSE: JEANINE TESORI at Merkin Hall (Feb. 9, 11 a.m.). Like many creative endeavors, composing for Broadway has long been dominated by men. On Sunday this series, which introduces children ages 4 to 11 to the authors of classic musicals, will celebrate one of the field's pioneering women. Although Tesori herself will not attend, young audience members will explore her work: In addition to an abbreviated production of "Shrek: The Musical," which features songs written for a gruff but good-hearted green ogre, they will be treated to excerpts from "Thoroughly Modern Millie" and the Tony Award-winning "Fun Home." Like all Broadway Playhouse programs, this one gives young theatergoers opportunities to perform: It will include an onstage game focused on conducting.
212-501-3303, kaufmanmusiccenter.org
THE CHILDREN'S CINEMA at Light Industry (Feb. 8, 2 p.m.). Almost exactly 62 years ago, Amos and Marcia Vogel, the married couple who founded Cinema 16, a film society showing avant-garde, experimental work to adults, started something even more radical: a program showing avant-garde, experimental work to children. Now Light Industry, an exhibition space in Brooklyn, is paying homage to that groundbreaking effort, which was called the Children's Cinema and geared toward ages 4 to 8. This Saturday afternoon screening -- doors open at 1:30, and seats are first come first served -- will recreate the first bill of short films in the series. It includes Lotte Reiniger's "The Grasshopper and the Ant" (1954), with animated figures that are hand-cut paper silhouettes; Len Lye's "Rainbow Dance" (1936), which was psychedelic long before anyone invented the word; "Parade" (1952), by Charles and Ray Eames, which has a cast of mechanical toys; and "The Balloonatic" (1923), an aerial adventure starring Buster Keaton.

'RAVEL AND DEBUSSY: "BOLÉRO"' at the Kaye Playhouse (Feb. 8, 10 and 11:30 a.m.; Feb. 9, 11:30 a.m. and 1 p.m.). Sometimes composers can create images as effectively as artists. This interactive program from L.O.S. Kids, a series for children ages 3 to 10 from the Little Orchestra Society, focuses on two Frenchmen, contemporaries and occasional rivals, who approached music as a form of painting with sound. Hosted by the silly yet scholarly character known as Professor Clifford O. Treblemaker, the performances (the two on Saturday offer the greatest ticket availability) will feature not only parts of Ravel's "Boléro" and "Ma Mère l'Oye," but also excerpts from Debussy's "La Mer" and "Clair de Lune" and the New York debut of "On Its Way," a Ravel-inspired piece by the young composer Nicky Sohn. In a nod to the visual theme, drawings that children created while listening to "La Mer" will be projected as a backdrop.

SUPER PET EXPO at the New Jersey Convention and Exposition Center in Edison, N.J. (Feb. 7, 3-8 p.m.; Feb. 8, 10 a.m.-7 p.m.; Feb. 9, 10 a.m.-5 p.m.). Macaws that roller skate and shoot baskets; dogs that play treibball, a soccerlike canine sport; cats that dive through hoops and tunnels -- you can see all kinds of trained behavior at this annual extravaganza for pet lovers, who are invited to take along their own (friendly and leashed) furry companions. New events this year include a show from Mister Crabs, which will teach children how to build hermit-crab habitats, and Frisbee-catching exhibitions by the Mid-Atlantic Disc Dog Club. In addition to entertainment and games, the weekend will offer care advice from veterinarians, a product marketplace, adoptable animals and an expo within the expo: Repticon, for those who prefer their creature friends coldblooded and hairless.

'THE TRAVELER' at Theater Row (Feb. 8-9, 11 a.m. and 2 p.m.). This show consists of one actor on a nearly empty stage, but it aims to encompass multitudes and many miles. Created by Bill Bowers and Andrew Frank for New York City Children's Theater, the 45-minute play captures the experience of immigrants and refugees who must leave everything familiar to strike out on their own. Bowers, a mime, portrays the wanderer of the title, who loses his home, packs his belongings in a suitcase, travels a long distance by foot and bus and eventually finds himself at a border crossing. Exploring what it means to form a community, the wordless production, for theatergoers 6 and older, will also be performed on April 7.
212-573-8791, ext. 1; nycchildrenstheater.org
WINTER WARMER at Rockefeller Plaza (Feb. 9, 11 a.m.-2 p.m.). Whatever the temperature is, youthful energy and high spirits should generate plenty of warmth at this free event on the plaza's concourse level. Featuring the year's first edition of Art Sundae, an initiative from the Art Production Fund and the gallery Fort Gansevoort, the program will invite children to create their own work with the sculptor, painter and performer Vanessa German. Using materials like cardboard cones, ribbon, twine, fabric, beads and buttons, little artists will build "power figures" -- sculptures representing hope and purpose -- for a future installation at the concourse's ticket booth. Other attractions include reggae from the Rock and Roll Playhouse, a gardening workshop, performances by Puppetsburg (with Frida Kahlo and Lizzo among the characters) and a science show about rainbows.
212-588-8601, rockefellercenter.com
'A WRINKLE IN TIME' MOVIE MATINEE AND BOOK TALK at Public School 10 (Feb. 8, 2-6 p.m.). Many children have to deal with a parent's absence, but none have quite the same problem as the middle-school student Meg Murry, whose father has disappeared to another part of the universe. Meg's extraterrestrial quest to find her dad, who was out to prove a scientific theory when he vanished, is at the core of "A Wrinkle in Time," the Newbery Medal-winning 1962 novel by the beloved writer Madeleine L'Engle. This special event in Brooklyn will start with a screening of Ava DuVernay's 2018 film adaptation, which is "demonstratively generous, encouraging and large-spirited," A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. After the movie, young readers can learn about another literary odyssey: Jennifer Szalai, a book critic for The Times, will lead a discussion with Charlotte Jones Voiklis, co-author of "Becoming Madeleine: A Biography of the Author of 'A Wrinkle in Time' by Her Granddaughters." A book signing will follow.

Texto completo: A deal would have a limited impact on the American economy, but the Trump administration sees it as an important geopolitical move.
WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration announced on Thursday that it would begin talks for a free-trade deal with Kenya, a step partly designed to counter China's influence in Africa.
The deal, which is likely to require many months of negotiations, would be the United States' first trade pact with a sub-Saharan African nation and its second with an African country. It signed an agreement with Morocco in 2004.
While the agreement could help some farmers and other industries sell into and invest in Kenya, it is unlikely to have much influence on the American economy overall. Kenya is the United States' 98th-largest trading partner in goods, with $ 1 billion in two-way trade in 2018, according to the Office of the United States Trade Representative. Kenya's biggest American imports include aircraft, machinery and agricultural goods; the United States buys Kenyan apparel, tree nuts and coffee.
But the Trump administration and other officials in Washington see the move partly in geopolitical terms, believing it could provide a model for other trade deals with African countries and be a step toward countering China's growing influence on the continent.
President Trump welcomed Kenya's president, Uhuru Kenyatta, to the White House on Thursday afternoon to discuss the plan. When a reporter asked if he planned to sign a trade agreement with Kenya, Mr. Trump responded, "Probably."
At the U.S. Chamber of Commerce later in the afternoon, during an event sponsored by Uber and other companies, Mr. Kenyatta said the agreement "will not only serve Kenya and the United States but will probably set the base for renewed engagement between the United States and other African countries."
"We see clearly the opportunity that exists, and we want to be trailblazers and set a path for others on the continent to follow," he told a gathering of American and Kenyan officials and businesspeople. He added, "Don't let others take what should be yours."
Robert Lighthizer, the United States trade representative, said in a statement that Kenya was "an important strategic partner of the United States, and there is enormous potential for us to deepen our economic and commercial ties." The administration believes that an agreement with Kenya "will receive broad bipartisan support in Congress," he added.
The Trump administration had discussed for more than two years which African country to select for trade talks -- an effort explicitly aimed at countering China.
Mr. Lighthizer said in a radio interview in early 2018 that Africa was only a few years away from being the world's population center, "and if we don't figure out a way to move them right, then China and others are going move them in the wrong direction," according to the publication Inside U.S. Trade.
China has lent vast sums of money to African governments and built ports, roads, airports and bridges around the continent as part of its Belt and Road Initiative. The projects include a 300-mile, $ 4 billion railway in Kenya that has linked Nairobi and Mombasa.
China says its investments in Africa are aimed purely at driving economic development, and many countries have welcomed improvements to their infrastructure that have aided the flow of commerce. But some projects have left governments, including Kenya's, saddled with billions of dollars of debt to China and sparked distrust and resentment.
In a 2018 speech in Washington attended by many African officials, Mr. Lighthizer said that many African countries had signed free-trade agreements with some of America's largest "competitors," like the European Union and China, and that these governments were investing heavily.
"My sense, however, is that many of you recognize the value of diversifying your commercial ties, and I know you recognize what American companies bring to the table," Mr. Lighthizer told the African officials.
Scott Eisner, the president of the U.S.-Africa Business Center at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said in a call with reporters on Wednesday that Kenya had made the most forceful case to the administration for starting trade talks.
"It really is who was willing to raise their hand and who had the most political will behind it," he said.
Mr. Eisner said the trade deal could benefit American agricultural producers who would sell into Kenya; textile manufacturers looking to invest in the country; and companies, like John Deere and Caterpillar, that would sell and service equipment. But if the deal is a comprehensive, high-standard trade agreement, it probably won't be completed this year, he said.
An agreement that addresses the bulk of trade between the countries would require congressional approval. Whether such a deal could pass Congress remains to be seen. For example, Democrats could be concerned about Kenya's low wages and labor standards.
Nations across Africa are pursuing a large-scale effort to break down trade barriers and integrate their economies. In May, the African Union initiated the African Continental Free Trade Area, a deal aimed at breaking down trade barriers and minimizing trade disputes.
Also, preferential trading terms that the United States has offered certain sub-Saharan African countries are set to expire in the coming years. The African Growth and Opportunity Act, which allows those countries to send goods to the United States duty free, is scheduled to expire in 2025, and it's unclear whether Congress will renew it. Over 70 percent of Kenya's exports to the United States enter under those terms, according to the United States trade representative's office.

Texto completo: A public memorial service for Kobe Bryant, his daughter and seven others killed in a helicopter crash is planned for Feb. 24 at Staples Center, The Los Angeles Times reported Thursday.
The arena is where Bryant starred for the Lakers for two decades and the date 2/24 corresponds with the No. 24 jersey he wore and the No. 2 worn by his 13-year-old daughter, Gianna.
Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti has said a memorial would be held but his office had no other immediate comment.
Bryant was killed Jan. 26 when the helicopter carrying him, his daughter and the others crashed into a mountainside in Calabasas while flying to a girls basketball tournament at his Mamba Sports Academy. Gianna's team was coached by Bryant and was playing in the tournament.
No cause for the crash has been determined, though a preliminary report by the National Transportation Safety Board is expected soon.
A game between the Clippers and the Grizzlies is scheduled for Feb. 24 at 7:30 p.m. at Staples.
Knicks to hire agent as team boss: Leon Rose, an NBA agent at Creative Artists Agency, will take over as Knicks team president, The New York Times reported. While Rose doesn't have experience in basketball operations, he has a deep well of connections to star players, including Carmelo Anthony and LeBron James, in his decades as an agent.
The Knicks moved swiftly to replace Steve Mills, who the team announced was leaving his post Tuesday.
Rose, a native of Cherry Hill, New Jersey who played basketball at Dickinson College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania and graduated from Temple law school in 1986, represented the likes of Allen Iverson, Richard Hamilton and LeBron James.
The Knicks last won the NBA championship in 1973.
All-Star captains make picks: LeBron James selected Lakers teammate Anthony Davis with the first pick in the All-Star player draft for the annual game Feb. 16 in Chicago.
Opposing captain Giannis Antetokounmpo of the Bucks took 76ers big man Joel Embiid with the second pick.

Is it really paid family leave? Trump's push for bill in SOTU differs from most proposals on the issue

Texto completo: President Donald Trump called for paid family leave Tuesday night in the State of the Union, the first Republican president to do so. But the bill he supported does not offer what has generally been considered paid family leave.
It is a bipartisan bill, introduced in December by Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz., and Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La. And it would enable new parents to collect a portion of their future child tax credits early and receive a smaller credit for the next 10-15 years.
Here's why it's different from most paid family leave proposals.
It does not provide a new source of funding to pay parents during leave; instead, they borrow from their future selves. It covers only leaves for babies or newly adopted children under 6; it does not cover care for sick family members or to take care of personal medical problems. And it does not guarantee that a person's job is protected when taking the leave.
Supporters of the bill describe it as a partial solution and a place to start, and say it doesn't preclude Congress from pursuing more comprehensive paid leave. It has some important advantages, they say: Its sponsors are bipartisan, which is rare on this issue. It doesn't raise taxes or create a mandate for businesses, two top priorities for Republicans. It also gives parents the freedom to use the money as they see fit, whether as wage replacement while on leave or to pay for infant or adoption expenses.
"Not only is it a good solution, but it's possible in the political world we live in today," Sinema said at an American Enterprise Institute and Brookings event in September.
Since first campaigning for president, Trump has expressed support for some kind of paid parental leave, and it has been a policy goal of his daughter, Ivanka.
Until Monday, the White House had said it was keeping every plan under consideration. This is the first time it endorsed one.
Traditionally, Republicans haven't supported paid leave - voicing concern about spending on new government programs and burdening businesses. So why is a Republican administration doing so?
Politically, analysts say, it appeals to a group of voters they need: suburban women, especially those who voted for Trump in 2016 but have considered Democrats since then.
"Everyone's talking about suburban female voters because they're deciding elections," said Olivia Perez-Cubas, a spokeswoman for the Winning for Women Action Fund, a political group dedicated to electing Republican women.
Paid leave, in general, is an easy sell with voters. Families need it - 72% of mothers and 93% of fathers with children at home are in the labor force - and a large majority of voters support it. But Americans, like their elected representatives, disagree on the details, particularly how to pay for it.
There is one model of government-run paid leave that has already been successfully adopted in the United States. In eight states and the District of Columbia, paid leave has been financed by a small payroll tax increase, paid by employees and employers. This is also the model that Democrats have proposed for all Americans, in a bill called the Family Act.
The child tax credit is worth up to $2,000 per child. If the Trump-backed bill passed, the average worker with a new child could receive $5,000, and then collect $500 less in child tax credits each year for 10 years.
The Family Act has minimal GOP support, and the deal breaker is the tax increase.
"A payroll tax increase is not going to be passed into law anytime soon," Ivanka Trump said on "Face the Nation" on CBS in December.

Texto completo: Headnote LOCAL
ONE WAS BORN in Leavenworth, Kansas, and the other in Philadelphia. One served in World War II, and the other rode an aircraft carrier in the North Atlantic about a decade later. One ran an ad agency, and the other had a long career as a consultant.
All the while, Alan Tripp (the Kansan WWII veteran, 102) and Marvin Weisbord (the seaworthy Philadelphian, 88) harbored an abiding love for the big-band jazz music of their youths. Now, the pair of residents of Beaumont at Bryn Mawr have put that love to good use, and recorded an album that's received international attention: "Senior Song Book."
"We did this because we really both believe this music ought to be preserved," Tripp said.
"Senior Song Book" is a 10-track album of original songs, with lyrics by Tripp and Weisbord. Taking the music of big-band leaders like Cole Porter and Jerome Kern, Tripp and Weisbord have recreated the sound of their musical heroes, but with ics in a contemporary idiom. Not that they're pretending to be something that they aren't; with song titles like "Best Old Friends," "Never Too Late for Love" and the lead single, "I Just Can't Remember Your Name," they know who the main audience is for their work.
But whatever they initially imagined their audience to be, it's grown far beyond that. NPR, The Washington Post, and even "The Kelly Clarkson Show" have covered Tripp and Weisbord's work.
For a couple of old media hands like Tripp and Weisbord, who have both spent a lifetime in and out of the industry, it's all just a cherry on top of the real sundae: a real, live recording of their work. Though Weisbord is pleased that his grandchildren can finally measure him in a metric that they truly understand - YouTube hits - he's quick to quash any notion that it's gone to his head. Celebrity culture is, after all, "a paroxysm of self-congratulation," in his words.
If it sounds to you like Weisbord knows how to turn a phrase, you're not alone. Editors of The New York Times Magazine and The New Republic certainly thought so when Weisbord was writing for them in the '50s and '60s. And readers did, too; his account of John F. Kennedy's 1960 presidential campaign, "Campaigning For President," went through two editions, and he wrote other sought-after books on photography and management.
Weisbord, who grew up attending Har Zion Temple back when it was in Wynnefield, studied journalism at the University of Illinois. He got his master's degree at the University of Iowa, taught journalism classes at Penn State for a few years, then moved back to Philadelphia to work in his father's printing business for almost a decade, while he pursued a doctorate in American studies at the University of Pennsylvania. All the while, he harbored a dream of making a little music. But he could never really get the hang of an instrument, aside from a few plonks on the piano.
He had a long career as a consultant, writing a handful of management books with titles like "Don't Just Do Something, Stand There!: Ten Principles for Leading Meetings That Matter," and "Organizational Diagnosis: a Workbook of Theory and Practice," available now on Amazon.
Now, he and his wife of 63 years, Dorothy, are at Beaumont. And it's just their luck that Tripp ended up there, too.

Tripp spent his childhood bouncing between Kansas, New York, Missouri and Illinois, the son of a businessman and a newspaperwoman. Though he was never able to plant himself in place long enough in those days to grow roots in a Jewish community, he still found sustenance from his people.
"My main Jewish education is the culture, which I consider to be extremely valuable wherever you move," he said. That culture: "That you intend to work and intend to do a little better than everybody else, cause you have to."
He went to high school in New York City, and heard the songs that would bounce around his head (and Weisbord's) for the rest of his life; at 15, he would try to peddle his songs outside of The Brill Building in Midtown Manhattan, one of the most important centers of popular music production in those days.
After graduating from Northwestern University, Tripp worked as a reporter in Chicago for a little while before he moved back to New York. He sold his first song around then, a jingle for Kool cigarettes, for a cool $75. "That was all the money in the world to me then," he said.
Tripp spent the war in the Army Signals Corps, and made his way to Philadelphia in the aftermath to found an ad agency called Bauer, Tripp & Foley. Like Weisbord, he had many careers; over the course of his life, he produced television shows, wrote magazine columns, penned songs with the legendary Alan Bergman before the latter met his wife and cowriter, Marilyn, helped bring new inventions to market and published books of his own poetry. He and his wife, Maggie, a prominent feminist activist, were married for 73 years.
Weisbord and Tripp met just five years ago, and it's been a productive partnership. Weisbord, who finally found the time for real piano lessons, set to music a poem that Tripp had written for his own 99th birthday, which led Tripp to drop a few more poems off on his friend's desk. From there, it was just a hop, skip and a jump to "Senior Song Book."
Tripp was eager to give credit to Weisbord, his writing partner and co-most-famousresident-of-the-Beaumont.
"Marvin is responsible for our doing this whole song album," he said. "It's his fault."
Weisbord is just happy his wife likes it.
"And that is a pleasant surprise, because she's pretty critical," he said. "So when she says she really likes it, you can take that to the bank."

Texto completo: Headnote PHILLY FACES
THERE'S MUCH FUN to be had in arguing about who should win an Academy Award. "Joker" or "Little Women" for Best Picture? Quentin Tarantino or Bong Joon-ho for Best Director? The arguments are endless.
But Ben Zauzmer has a different question in mind: Who will win? And it's one he answers correctly, just about every time.
Zauzmer, 27, a Dresher native, is a Harvard University graduate and a baseball analyst for the Los Angeles Dodgers. Since he was an undergrad, he's been developing an algorithm to predict each year's Oscar winners. Last fall, he even released a book on the subject: "Oscarmetrics: The Math Behind the Biggest Night in Hollywood."
How would you describe your "Oscarmetrics" project?
In a nutshell, I use math to answer questions about the Oscars. Most notably, I predict each year's Academy Awards using data and statistics. But I also write articles exploring all sorts of questions about the Oscars through a mathematical lens, and I recently wrote a book called "Oscarmetrics" to tell stories about the Oscars and classic cinema via math.
How did you come to start analyzing the Oscars in this way?
This all began in the months leading up to the 2012 Oscars, during my freshman year of college. I am an avid follower of statisticians who use data to predict other fields like baseball and politics. Being a movie fan as well, I assumed that someone must have done the same for the Oscars. But when 1 went to Google and couldn't find any such predictions, I decided to try it myself. I spent a month in the library gathering data and building models, then put my predictions up online and this whole project has blossomed from there.
When did it become apparent that people were really starting to pay attention to this? And what was that like?
My very first year, I began to get press coverage from around the world. I was predicting the Oscars in a novel way, and people were very curious to know what the predictions said (that year, the math correctly identified "The Artist" as the favorite to win Best Picture, Best Director and Best Actor and got a very close Best Actress race that Meryl Streep won for "The Iron Lady"). But this work really took off in my junior year of college, when The Hollywood Reporter invited me to begin writing for them, a relationship that continues to this day. Since then, I've done TV, radio and print interviews for publications across the globe, and written additional freelance articles for The New York Times, The Washington Post and others.

How would you compare the challenges of your Oscarmetrics work to those of your work for the Dodgers?
Baseball statistics can be challenging because of how much data there is; Oscar statistics can be challenging because of how little data there is. In baseball, a single game provides more data than all of Oscar history. So the challenge in my day job is finding the signal, the part of the data that has a pattern, or tells a story, or helps us to make a better decision. With the Oscars, the challenge is to build models that don't overreact to small amounts of data.
Do you feel that there is an overlap between your work as a mathematician and your life as a Jewish person?
Something I love about both mathematics and Judaism is how rational they are. The arguments in the Talmud for why Jews follow certain practices are often very lawyer-like, very rational and very mathematical. We as Jews and we as mathematicians are always encouraged to ask "why?" We want to engage in the discussion and learn for ourselves why something is the best practice. And in both subjects, we rely on the wisdom of teachers who have already studied these questions to help guide us along, and then we are free to agree or to find alternative rational arguments that make more sense. *

'Truman Torah,' Owner Reunited at NMAJH

IT HAD BEEN more than 70 years since Rabbi Ezra Finkelstein, 92, last saw his Torah. But on Jan. 30, Finkelstein's Torah, diminutive in size but overflowing with meaning, was reunited, if just for a brief moment, with its original owner.
The Torah's purpose that day was, as it had been nearly 80 years ago, to commemorate a bar mitzvah - Finkelstein's. A crowd had gathered in the downstairs auditorium of the National Museum of American Jewish History and, from the looks of things, celebratory davening was imminent. Men wrapped in tefillin, and some women, too; men wrapped in prayer shawls, and some women, too.
The Finkelsteins, their friends, family and many rabbinical colleagues were about to show this "Truman Torah" what it had been missing all these years living in Midwestern exile.
At times, there was so much being celebrated, almost simultaneously, that it became hard to keep track: There was Rabbi Finkelstein seeing his childhood Torah, and there was also the commemoration of the 80th anniversary of his bar mitzvah (clergy leading the service even presented the 92-year-old "bar mitzvah boy" with an enormous chocolate bar). But, ultimately, the whole program might be said to have been one big tear-inducing vehicle for celebrating the life and work of Finkelstein himself.

On May 14, 1948, Prime Minister David Ben Gurion proclaimed Israeli nationhood. Just 11 minutes later, acting swiftly and decisively - and against the recommendations of trusted advisers like Secretary of State George C. Marshall - President Harry Truman formally recognized the new state of Israel, becoming the first member of the international community to do so.
Ten days later, Finkelstein's Torah, the one his father had commissioned to commemorate his bar mitzvah eight years prior, in 1940, was gone. Unknown then to Finkelstein was that his Torah had become what might be called the first official casualty of AmericanIsraeli diplomacy.
It wasn't lost; it had been recommissioned, promoted by his famous-in-rabbinical-circles father for a higher purpose. At the time, though, Finkelstein, to whom the Torah technically belonged, was left in the dark.
"The next day, my father didn't even know about it because my grandfather didn't ask him (before he took the Torah) - he saw the picture in The New York Times," Finkelstein's son Harvey told a roomful of his father's friends, family and rabbinical colleagues, all of whom laughed heartily.
The Torah itself, lovely scroll of wood and parchment that it is, didn't itself merit such prominent placement in the Times; it was that higher purpose, the one Finkelstein's father had used it for, that landed it there, nestled between Chaim Weizmann, the first president of the newly-declared Israeli provisional government, and Truman, to that point the newly formed state's best friend in the world.
Rabbi Louis Finkelstein, then the chancellor of the Jewish Theological Seminary and the most dominant figure in Conservative Judaism, received word from Weizmann just days before the historic photo-op; the Israeli president had been invited to the White House on short notice and was in danger of showing up empty handed. Could the esteemed rabbi help?
According to Harvey Finkelstein, Weizmann first asked the elder Rabbi Finkelstein for a menorah from The Jewish Museum, which then, as now, operated under JTS auspices.
"That was not his to give away," he said. "But somewhere in his memory was the idea that the Jewish people should always give the head of a country a Torah, and the only thing he actually owned was my father's Torah that he gave to him at his bar mitzvah."
So the leader of American Conservative Jewry repossessed his son's prized Torah for the sake of getting official American-Israeli relations off on the right foot.
Just like that, the Finkelstein Torah was sent away, like a child sent to overnight camp with a visiting day that comes but once every 70 years, to live its new life at Camp Truman.
For Truman, a gentile who'd forever be linked to Israel's creation, the Torah from Weizmann was no ordinary state gift. It represented a stand he'd taken against intense political pressure to do what he thought right. It would become a cherished spiritual totem of talismanic import for a man who would never wear a tallis.
And he was hawkishly protective over it; he was adamant that it was always to remain with him, said Kurt Graham, director of the Truman Presidential Library and Museum.
Several years after the gift, the elder Rabbi Finkelstein quietly tried to broker a deal with Truman to return the Truman Torah to the Jewish Museum in New York City. He gently pleaded with the president, Rabbi (Ezra) Finkelstein told me: "He said 'Mr. President, the Sefer Torah is a sacred possession of the Jewish people, and it would be a great honor to have it in our Jewish Museum - 10-15,000 people would come see it every year.' To which Truman, not missing a beat, said, '100,000 are going to come see it in my library. It's staying with me.'"
And it did.
It stayed with him in the White House, then came with him when he retired to Independence, Missouri, then became part of the permanent collection at the Truman Presidential Library when it opened in Independence, on a hill overlooking the Kansas City skyline, in 1955.
Though certainly the Finkelsteins valued the physical Torah itself, it was that contained therein, which they'd extracted and made the fabric of their family lives, that was, and remains, most prized.
Said Harvey Finkelstein, "Through his journey in life, my father didn't have the Torah as an object, but he had the Torah inside of him from the lessons he taught. My father, and mother Elaine, taught us that having a physical Torah is not what it's about. It's about what the Torah means to us and to our traditions that makes us the light unto the nations."
This has been a lesson that's been passed down through the generations of Finkelsteins - before Rabbi Finkelstein passed it down to his three children, he'd learned it from his eminent father.
"He taught us that the Torah was a symbol," said Rabbi Finkelstein, who admitted that, even at 92, for better or worse, his father is still the primary organizing principle and reference point in his life. "That Torah was a symbol of the commitment of two Jews to the state of Israel: Chaim Weizmann and my father, who recognized that a Sefer Torah doesn't belong to one child; it belongs to the world." �

Bill introduced The New Jersey Attorney General recently prohibited law enforcement in all 21 counties from using Clearview AI's facial recognition software after a New York Times article revealed the start-up had built its database by scrubbing billions of photos from online social media platforms. In light of many concerns regarding the implications of this new technology, Assembly Democrats Andrew Zwicker and Herb Conaway introduced a measure (A-1210) to require the Attorney General or governing body of a county or municipality, as appropriate, to host a public hearing prior to the implementation of any facial recognition technology by a State or local law enforcement agency.

Texto completo: With an enclave of scientists gathering next week in Seattle, it is appropriate to reiterate the role of knowledge for creating a prosperous and inhabitable world.
Indeed, the theme of this year's meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science is “Envisioning Tomorrow's Earth.” Geologists, chemists, physicists and other scientists will rub elbows with educators, journalists and additional interested parties from Feb. 13-16 at the organization's 186th annual meeting, attending seminars at and near the Washington State Convention Center. The convention also will include free public lectures and other low-cost events, including two Family Science Days.
The American Association for the Advancement of Science is one of the nation's oldest scientific societies, adhering to a mission that long has driven humans' thirst for knowledge: “To cultivate every art and science which may tend to advance the interest, honor, dignity, and happiness of a free, independent, and virtuous people.”
That is meaningful in an age when science is increasingly under attack. From vaccine critics to a president who denies the existence of climate change, vast swaths of the populace eschew scientific study in favor of dogma.
As Joel Achenbach wrote in “Why Do Many Reasonable People Doubt Science?,” an article for National Geographic: “We live in an age when all manner of scientific knowledge faces organized and often furious opposition. Empowered by their own sources of information and their own interpretation of research, doubters have declared war on the consensus of experts.”
That trend predates the presidency of Donald Trump; he is merely a symptom of the disease. But the Trump administration has persistently worked to undermine the role of scientific evidence in the making of policy. In December, a New York Times article detailed that: “Political appointees have shut down government studies, reduced the influence of scientists over regulatory decisions and in some cases pressured researchers not to speak publicly. The administration has particularly challenged scientific findings related to the environment and public health opposed by industries such as oil drilling and coal mining. It has also impeded research around human-caused climate change, which President Trump has dismissed despite a global scientific consensus.”
The immediate impact is the halting of studies, such as one examining the effects of chemicals on pregnant women. The administration has long held that pervasive regulations have hampered industries; rather than use evidence to demonstrate regulations are unnecessary, it has simply stopped the quest for knowledge.
The long-term impact is even more insidious, with scores of scientists leaving the administration and creating a brain drain that will take decades to overcome. For example, the abrupt relocation of two agricultural agencies that study the economics of farming led to an exodus of experts.
Trump supporters view this as a feature, not a bug. But the growth of an anti-science ethos in American society has a deleterious effect. Contrary to rhetoric, scientists study an issue to find answers, not push an agenda. Findings are subject to peer review and must be replicable by other researchers. As Achenbach wrote: “Even for scientists, the scientific method is a hard discipline.”
All of that is relevant as Seattle prepares to host thousands of scientists. Americans must celebrate the quest for knowledge rather than believing they have

Wexner ignored inappropriate behavior at Victoria’s Secret

Texto completo: (JTA) — Leslie Wexner, CEO of the parent company of Victoria’s Secret, allowed one of his top executives to harass and bully former employees and models, according to a New York Times investigation.
The report published Feb. 2 comes days after a Times story said that Wexner, founder of L Brands, has been in discussions to step aside as its chief executive reportedly over his ties to the disgraced late financier Jeffrey Epstein, who Wexner employed for years as a personal adviser over his finances, philanthropy and private life.
Wexner is a billionaire entrepreneur and a prominent philanthropist, particularly in the areas of Jewish learning and other Jewish causes.
The Times investigation involved interviews with more than 30 current and former executives, employees, contractors and models, as well as court filings and other documents.
Executives told The Times that they informed Wexner about the inappropriate behavior of longtime chief marketing officer Ed Razek, but the behavior continued. Razek, according to the report, “was perceived as Mr. Wexner’s proxy, leaving many employees with the impression he was invincible. On multiple occasions, Mr. Wexner himself was heard demeaning women.”
Razek often reminded models that their careers were in his hands, and also during photo shoots asked them for their phone numbers or to sit on his lap, according to the report.
Razek, 71, stepped down from L Brands in August. He told The Times that the accusations are “categorically untrue, misconstrued or taken out of context.” Wexner did not comment for the article.
The company expressed “regret” for not achieving its goals on corporate governance, workplace and compliance practices.

ProPublica Nominated for Four National Magazine Awards

Texto completo: The American Society of Magazine Editors nominated ProPublica for four of its 2020 National Magazine Awards (also known as the Ellies), which honor excellence in print and digital media. ProPublica was recognized as a finalist for public interest, reporting, podcasting and digital innovation.
Our “Disaster in the Pacific” series, examining three Navy and Marines accidents in 2017 and 2018 that resulted in the deaths of 23 service members, was nominated for public interest. Our reporting by T. Christian Miller, Megan Rose and Robert Faturechi showed that U.S. sailors and aviators are often not properly trained for combat and are frequently sent out with outmoded or slipshod equipment. When the inevitable accidents occurred, investigations led by senior officers blamed rank-and-file sailors for what were clearly systemic shortcomings. These stories struck a chord with a wide range of active-duty personnel and their loved ones and prompted congressional hearings on the issues we spotlighted.
Our reporting on the use of jailhouse informants to secure convictions, co-published with the New York Times Magazine, was nominated for reporting. Senior reporter Pamela Colloff focused on a notorious con artist named Paul Skalnik who, in at least 40 different criminal cases in Florida and Texas, miraculously extracted richly detailed “confessions” from his fellow inmates. Skalnik gave powerful testimony that prosecutors used to secure convictions, receiving lighter sentences and earlier release dates in return. Colloff’s piece also illuminated the sometimes catastrophic effects of jailhouse informant testimony and how it corrupts the justice system.
Our visualization of the spread of the natural gas industry across West Virginia, created in partnership with ProPublica Local Reporting Network partner the Charleston Gazette-Mail, was nominated for digital innovation. ProPublica news applications developer Al Shaw and Gazette-Mail reporter Kate Mishkin assembled every single aerial image taken by the U.S. Department of Agriculture to build a map showing the location of more than 5,000 permitted natural gas wells. The interactive graphic allowed residents to search for well permits near their homes. For the first time, people across the state had the data to know how close they were living to potentially harmful fracking operations.
Trump, Inc., a podcast by ProPublica and WNYC, was nominated in the podcasting category. The podcast examines the business dealings of President Donald Trump and his family, including episodes on the Ukraine scandal and never-before-seen Trump tax documents showing major inconsistencies. New York Magazine’s Vulture website named Trump, Inc. among the best news podcasts of all time: “It’s like they’re pointing a spotlight at a big but finite canvas and moving it around until they find something amazing and newsworthy.”

Texto completo: On Oct. 19, 2016, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton took to the stage for their third and final debate.
With gloves off, the two candidates were prepared to engage in another no-holds-barred battle of words in hopes of wrestling the hearts of the American voters into submission.
Fox News’ Chris Wallace, who was the least biased moderator in the three debates, sat rigidly with questions in hand.
During the debate, Wallace asked Trump if he would “absolutely accept the result of this election.” Trump replied, “I will look at it at the time. I’m not looking at anything now. I’ll look at it at the time.”
This exchange immediately sent the Democrats and the national media into an apocalyptic frenzy.
Wrote The New York Times: “In a remarkable statement that seemed to cast doubt on American democracy, Donald J. Trump said Wednesday that he might not accept the results of next month’s election if he felt it was rigged against him — a stand that Hillary Clinton blasted as ‘horrifying’ at their final and caustic debate.”
And just like that, the narrative pushed by Clinton, the Democrats and the national media warned that Trump was going to destroy American democracy should he lose by not “absolutely accepting” the results of the 2016 election.
Election and its aftermath
Flipping through the networks late into election night, Nov. 8, 2016, I noted that the anchors reporting results appeared somber, stunned and pale, as it became clear that Donald J. Trump would become the 45th president of the United States.
The next day, Clinton addressed her supporters. “We must accept this result,” she said. “Donald Trump is going to be our president. ... We owe him an open mind and a chance to lead.”
The left would not get the message.
Filmmaker Michael Moore called for a public “resistance.” Green Party candidate Jill Stein, who received 1.07% of the popular vote, called for a recount in the swing states that all just so happened to tip in Trump’s favor.
The left and supportive media outlets, angered that Clinton had won the popular vote but lost the presidency, then launched a campaign to influence public opinion: A simple popular vote, they insisted, should determine victory — not the nation’s Electoral College.
On Inauguration Day, Jan. 20, 2017, protesters unable to accept the election results stormed Washington, D.C. Amid them were violent rioters who used hammers and crowbars to smash and destroy windows and storefronts.
And just minutes after the president took his oath of office, The Washington Post ran a story titled: “The campaign to impeach President Trump has begun.”
The next day, Hollywood actresses and female pop stars joined the Women’s March to protest Trump’s election. Many women wore pink hats representing a female body part, while singer Madonna delivered a speech in which she admitted she had “thought an awful lot about blowing up the White House.”
Before long, stories of Russian influence in the 2016 presidential election and alleged coordination with the Trump campaign began dominating mainstream news cycles.
Democrats and the national media turned up the political pressure to appoint a special counsel to investigate. And for nearly two years, special counsel Robert Mueller left no stone unturned as he and his team searched for a conspiracy they couldn’t prove existed.
Meanwhile, Democrats and their media outlets accused Trump of being a puppet of Russian President Vladimir Putin — of being a Russian asset. Unfortunately for them, the Mueller report didn’t give them the excuse to impeach Trump for which they had waited with bated breath.
This didn’t stop Clinton from occasionally resurfacing to blame Russia for her defeat.
Then came Ukraine
U.S. House Democrats would not be deterred from their impeachment quest and their stubborn refusal to accept the results of the 2016 election.
Then Trump spoke by phone with the president of Ukraine. An anonymous CIA agent blew the whistle, claiming Trump had abused his power during that phone call. A narrative claiming nefarious intent was framed — though not proven — in the subsequent impeachment inquiry launched by the Democrats.
With a desperate tenacity, the House Democrats voted to impeach Trump. Then House Speaker Nancy Pelosi held onto the articles of impeachment for weeks, seeking to use them as leverage to control the Senate in the hopes of overturning the will of the American people in 2016.
During the Senate trial, the House impeachment managers claimed that the evidence they presented was overwhelming, yet somehow also declared they needed more witnesses and more documents to bolster their case.
They sought not only to overturn the 2016 election but to remove Trump from the 2020 ballot.
They failed.
Acquittal
Late Wednesday afternoon, the Senate voted to acquit President Trump.
But this latest scheme by the Democrats to overturn the Trump presidency will not be their last.
With each attempt to overturn the 2016 election, the Democrats manage only to make many of us wearier and more suspicious of their motives.
They seem totally unaware of the ramifications of their actions. If the president wins in a landslide victory in November, the Democrats and their media cohorts will have no one left to blame except for themselves and their inability to accept the results of an election.

Make Architecture Great Again

Texto completo: Washington, D.C., is a melange of architecture that makes little sense. Some of it is Roman, (the Supreme Court, the Capitol Building, etc.), some of it is French (namely, the Eisenhower Executive Office Building), and the rest is downright ugly.
The Trump administration wants to change that. A draft of an executive order entitled “Making Federal Buildings Beautiful Again” would make classical Roman and Greek architecture the default for new federal buildings in Washington.
Spearheaded by the National Civic Art Society, the order attempts to restore Washington’s aesthetic and do away with the damage wrought by contemporary architecture, which has “created a built environment that is degraded and dehumanizing,” the society said.
“For too long architectural elites and bureaucrats have derided the idea of beauty, blatantly ignored public opinions on style, and have quietly spent taxpayer money constructing ugly, expensive, and inefficient buildings,” Marion Smith, the group’s chairman, told the New York Times.
A few architects, joined by liberals who are obligated to oppose the Trump administration, have expressed displeasure with the executive order. But one stroll around Washington should be enough to change their minds. The bureaucratic buildings are nothing more than big, rectangular slabs of concrete plastered with a few windows. Even the windows are a rarity! The Department of Energy’s building has an entire wall that is nothing but cement, and over at the Department of Labor, there’s an interstate on-ramp that literally cuts through the building.
The bureaucracy is an eyesore, but perhaps that’s fitting. Regulation is a blot itself, so at least the exterior matches the interior.
Besides, we should hope Trump’s executive order is never needed. Because if it is, that means new government buildings are getting built, and, well, you get the picture.

Texto completo: The killing of a man who was set to testify against MS-13 gang members in open court has ignited debate about New York state's new criminal justice reforms.
Wilmer Maldonado Rodriguez was found dead Sunday outside his home on Long Island, police said. Rodriguez had intervened as gang members were threatening two boys when he was stabbed and beaten in October of 2018.
New York's controversial new discovery law, enacted on Jan. 1 with a slew of other criminal justice reforms, dictates when prosecutors can release information about individuals involved in crimes, including identities. Weeks before Rodriguez's death, a judge ordered prosecutors to disclose his identity to the lawyers representing the gang members accused of attacking him.
Previously, the state was among ten that let prosecutors wait until the eve of trial to hand over witness names and other evidence. However, the new law calls for such information to generally be revealed within 15 days before a suspect's arraignment.
"This courageous man was prepared to testify against alleged assailants at an upcoming trial, but he was brutally beaten to death before he could," Madeline Singas, the Nassau County district attorney, told the New York Times.
The local police chief told Newsday, "This man’s dead because we didn’t do enough."

Iowa mess gets worse: Analysis finds inconsistencies in over 100 official caucus-site reports

Texto completo: The Iowa Democratic Party's woes in reporting results from its presidential nominating caucuses are multiplying, with an analysis of official results finding inconsistencies in more than 100 precincts.
The New York Times found instances where vote tallies did not add up, where state delegate equivalents (the traditional measure used to determine the winner) were awarded incorrectly, or where raw results should not be possible.
It's the latest headache for Iowa Democrats, who ran Monday's caucuses and still have not reported an official winner.
Changes to caucus rules this year included locking in support on the first alignment for candidates who met a 15% viability threshold, meaning that it should be impossible for candidates who met 15% on the first alignment to have a smaller number of votes on the final alignment. The analysis found at least 10 instances where a candidate viable on the first alignment lost support on the final alignment, which would not be possible under correctly-followed caucus procedures.
In at least 70 precincts, there are more votes recorded for the final alignment than on the first alignment, which should also not be possible since no more caucusgoers are allowed to join a precinct after the start time at 7 p.m.
Candidates who won more votes received fewer state delegate equivalents in at least 15 precinct sites, and a few were awarded more state delegate equivalents than they were allotted.
Inconsistencies identified in the analysis are only the latest snafu in the Iowa results.
A coding glitch in an app meant to quickly transmit results from the precinct sites to party headquarters on Monday night delayed the first results for a day, derailing candidate victory parties and sending them all to New Hampshire uncertain of the ultimate winner. That caused the state party to verify results manually, but a backup phone line meant to be used to report results had long hold times and was flooded with calls from supporters of President Trump, causing further delays. Some results are being sent by snail mail.
As official tallies slowly trickled in, one batch of results reported Wednesday incorrectly awarded support to long-shot candidates, businessman Tom Steyer and former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick, but was quickly corrected. The other inconsistencies remain.
Iowa Democratic Party Chairman Tom Price said Tuesday that the app problems "did not impact the ability of precinct chairs to report data accurately." But problems identified by the New York Times suggest that those running the more than 1,600 caucus sites had difficulty following the new rules or performing the "caucus math" to determine delegate allocation.
The problems would not have been recognized without a new transparency rule — pushed by supporters of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, following his close loss to Hillary Clinton in the 2016 Iowa caucuses — where the Iowa Democratic Party is reporting raw vote totals in the precincts for first and final alignment. In previous years, only the state delegate equivalent figure was reported.
Current official results with 96% of precincts reporting, with the inconsistencies, reveal a razor-thin race with former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg with 26.2% of state delegate equivalents and Sanders with 26.1%. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and former Vice President Joe Biden are in third and fourth place with 18.2% and 15.8%, respectively.

DNC Chairman Tom Perez is making the Iowa caucus disaster worse

Texto completo: The Democratic National Committee is now throwing its Iowa affiliate under the bus and demanding a recanvass of Monday’s caucus results.
Tweet
DNC Chairman Tom Perez is right about the lack of public confidence. An analysis by the New York Times confirmed on Thursday that the official results released by the Iowa Democratic Party are riddled with errors and inconsistencies — some stemming from individual precincts, and others from the party itself. In some cases, the totals submitted by individual precincts directly contradict the official results released by the Iowa Democratic Party, the Times reported.
Due to this internal confusion, it’s safe to say the official results will be widely questioned regardless of who wins. But it doesn’t help that the two leading candidates, Pete Buttigieg and Bernie Sanders, are separated by such a narrow margin that it’s unclear who, exactly, is on top. Earlier this week, it appeared Buttigieg was ahead. But now, it looks like Sanders might yet pull it out. And of course, there's also the question of which measure of victory to go by — caucusgoers (Sanders wins easily) or the traditional measure of delegate equivalents?

Given the inconsistencies and tight margins, a recanvass isn’t an outlandish suggestion. But this demand should have come from one of the campaigns, not from the DNC, and it probably should have been demanded in private. By publicly questioning the Iowa Democratic Party on Twitter, Perez has thrown the national party into a personal dispute and opened the national party up to criticism from those who will interpret this as an attempt to pick a side.

The Sanders camp already believes the DNC wronged Sanders in 2016, with good reason. And the timing of Perez’s recanvass demand will only exacerbate this open wound. Sanders began to inch above Buttigieg just hours before Perez called on the Iowa Democratic Party to recanvass. How is this supposed to look?
Perez's walk-back a few hours later made things even worse. Perez clarified that a recanvass doesn't necessarily mean a recount and that he's specifically concerned with the way the Iowa Democratic Party allocated its state delegate equivalents, according to CNN. Keep in mind: Sanders is currently overtaking Buttigieg in state delegate equivalents. In short, the DNC chairman is actively raising questions about a calculating process that has helped Sanders overtake Buttigieg.

The Iowa caucuses have been nothing but chaos and confusion, but Perez is making things worse. If this is his idea of damage control, he should think again.

Texto completo: The ladder of American politics has a top and a bottom. It took President Trump two weeks, maybe three, to climb to the top. During that time, Democrats tripped and fell to the bottom.
The causes of change can pile up quickly in politics, and indeed they have. But their consequences have yet to be understood by the media, Democrats, and even many Republicans. One thing, though, is clear: Trump is now in the strongest position of his presidency, and while he’s hardly a shoo-in to win a second term, his reelection prospects are better than ever.
Think about what’s driven Trump’s rise, starting with impeachment. That the president has gained from the ordeal unleashed by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is more than a lucky break. It’s an amazing development that was foreseen by very few. It not only hurt Democrats; it has prompted an increase in approval of Republicans.
Pelosi turns out to be the most agonized victim of her decision to impeach Trump. She seemed agitated and unhappy during his State of the Union address. And Democratic members of Congress looked like a ragtag army stranded on the House floor, unsure when to sit, stand, or chant “H.R. 3,” a bill to cut prescription drug prices.
While the economy continues to boost Trump, there are special reasons why it makes Democrats miserable. Liberal economists, notably New York Times columnist Paul Krugman, assured them Trump and recessions were synonymous. With Trump in charge, the well-being of the public would become a thing of the past. The economists were wrong.
Trump has leapfrogged mere boasting about economic growth. He loves to talk about how minorities, whom Democrats see as their loyalists, have fared in the three years of his presidency. Here’s the White House transcript of his State of the Union speech:
“The unemployment rate for African Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Asian Americans has reached the lowest levels in history. (Applause.) African American youth unemployment has reached an all-time low. (Applause.) African American poverty has declined to the lowest rate ever recorded. (Applause.)”
In foreign policy, Trump’s greatest success is the humbling of Iran’s ruling mullahs. His decision to kill Qassem Soleimani, the Iranian terrorist chief, and the slapping of sanctions on Iran have crippled its economy and weakened its role in the world. Another result: The president’s stature, or at least his prowess, has increased.
This has led Trump to a new tack in dealing with the mullahs. If Iran abandons “its pursuit of nuclear weapons” and stops “spreading terror,” he promises to help revive its economy. “Perhaps they are too proud or too foolish to ask for that help,” he said in the State of the Union. “We are here. Let’s see which road they choose. It is totally up to them.”
Roger Kimball, the editor of the New Criterion, assessed Trump’s standing after the address to Congress. “The irony … is that despite the endless carping of his opponents in the government, the media, and the corridors of elite power, Donald Trump has emerged from the unremitting ad hominem attacks stronger and more persuasive.”
His reelection effort is far ahead of the campaign of any Democratic presidential rival, including billionaire Michael Bloomberg. And if the nominee is not decided until the Democratic convention in July, all the better for Trump.
But if he believes he can cruise to reelection, he is mistaken. He will be opposed by most of the media. Democrats are likely to vote in record numbers. And his enemies will finance a national dragnet to uncover unsavory tales, offensive comments, or questionable actions to use against him.
Scott Reed, manager of Republican Bob Dole’s bid for president in 1996, says the Trump campaign must deal with two priorities: message control and the suburban vote. And both involve Trump’s personality and tendency to cause trouble with off-the-cuff remarks and tweets. He can’t afford to alienate college-educated voters, women especially, as he did in 2016. In the 2018 midterm elections, Trump’s behavior was a cause of sweeping defeats in suburbs and the loss of the House.
Reed believes Trump “touched all the right political buttons” in the State of the Union address. Of those he introduced in the balcony, there was an emphasis on African Americans and Hispanics. It was a disciplined performance by the president. He read the speech from the teleprompters. He didn’t ad-lib. He rarely smiled. He was disciplined. “It was a tour de force,” Reed said, the kind that will keep Trump at the top of the political ladder.

Texto completo: In the fall, it looked like Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren might just run away with her party’s presidential nomination, as she topped former Vice President Joe Biden in many early state polls.
But following a series of events, including a slew of New York Times/Siena College polls showing that Warren performed the worst of any front-runner against President Trump in swing states, as well as a number of contentious debates with former South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg over "Medicare for all" and money in politics, her lead vanished. Warren's third-place finish in Iowa makes it unlikely the Massachusetts senator will retain her status as a top-tier candidate unless she pulls off an upset in New Hampshire.
If her campaign does collapse soon, political observers will gather to write obituaries of her failed bid for the White House, seeking to explain her rise and fall. I’m sure many will ask, "What happened to Elizabeth Warren’s campaign?" But my question is, what happened to Elizabeth Warren?
In the fall of 2012, I helped Warren get elected by working with an outside progressive group to raise thousands of dollars and corral dozens of volunteers for her. Warren’s appeal that year was simple. She was a Republican-turned-bankruptcy law professor who left the party after growing incensed about the financial sector’s abuses. While she was reliably liberal in her political orientation, her message was anything but sectarian. She wanted to build a broad and deep coalition to tackle economic unfairness and to rally the middle class around an agenda that promoted broad prosperity.
It was a winning message in Massachusetts, and as a U.S. senator, she found her niche taking on economic elites on Wall Street and within the Obama administration. Just ask Larry Summers, who isn’t in charge of the Federal Reserve today, partly thanks to Warren’s forceful advocacy against him.
That Elizabeth Warren was present at times in the finer moments of her presidential campaign — when she would talk about the hollowing out of the middle class, for instance.
But over the course of her bid, Warren grew increasingly chauvinistic, personally attacking anyone who disagreed with her as corrupt or a heretic. When Biden raised questions about "Medicare for all," Warren accused him of “repeating Republican talking points” and even went so far as to say that he was “running in the wrong presidential primary.” After years of doing private fundraisers with very rich people, she went out of her way to assail Buttigieg, one of the least wealthy candidates in the race, for doing a fundraising event in a California “wine cave.”
It would be one thing if Warren’s insults were limited to political opponents. But she even started lashing out at everyday people who didn’t share her politics. When a questioner at a televised town hall asked her what she would say to someone who disagrees with gay marriage, Warren showed little empathy for the position even Barack Obama took during his first race for the presidency.
“Well, I’m going to assume it’s a guy who said that,” Warren replied. “And I’m gonna say, ‘Then just marry one woman.' I’m cool with that.” As the crowd laughed, she added, “Assuming you can find one.”
The antagonistic answer, implying that only men opposed gay marriage (and that they were probably losers who couldn’t find a woman, to boot), was surely a crowd-pleaser among the upper-crust social liberals who flocked to Warren’s campaign in droves. But according to the latest Pew data, around 51% of black people support gay marriage. That means about half of this important Democratic constituency isn’t on the same page as Warren is on this issue. As those of us who have worked in and study politics know, minority voters are often much more socially conservative than white voters, particularly within the Democratic coalition. And rather than approach those people with humility and charity, Warren chose instead to insult them.
It’s hardly a surprise, then, that Warren never took off with minority voters. According to the latest Morning Consult polling, Warren’s support among black and Hispanic voters is around just 10%. Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who has done little else except spend hundreds of millions of dollars on television ads, has already overtaken Warren among these key constituencies.
This failing has not been helped by the fact that Warren’s outreach strategy toward America’s Hispanic population has been to refer to this populous minority group as “Latinx," a gender-neutral neologism favored by leftist ideologues that only around 2% of Latinos themselves use, according to one survey. It is hardly a surprise that most of Iowa’s small Latino population appear to have favored Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. At least his campaign uses the same language they do.
In her campaign’s pre-Iowa closing pitch, Warren preached unity, making the case that she can bring together warring Democratic Party factions. But by attaching herself to woke chauvinism and attacking her rivals so harshly, she appeared anything but unifying. After all, it was Sanders and Buttigieg who agreed to go on Fox News and talk to the other half of America. Warren instead chose to deride the network as a “for-profit hate racket,” perhaps deciding to court the all-powerful Media Matters vote rather than the votes of those who watch America’s most popular network.
In perhaps her most bizarre bit of pandering, she told supporters in Iowa that she will ask a transgender child to vet her education secretary pick. “I'm going to have a secretary of education that this young trans person interviews on my behalf,” she said, “and only if this person believes that our secretary or secretary of education nominee is absolutely committed to creating a welcoming environment, a safe environment, and a full educational curriculum for everyone will that person actually be advanced to be secretary of education.”
As someone who has worked around the professional progressive movement for the past decade, I don’t think most of the progressive agenda itself is the problem. From a wealth tax to some form of universal healthcare, many of these ideas are popular. The problem with modern progressivism is how much it looks down on people who disagree. It’s a kind of elitism that makes populism impossible, because you can’t have populism without the population. The old Elizabeth Warren understood that. It appears that the new Elizabeth Warren has forgotten it.

Texto completo: A top Chinese official has ordered authorities where the coronavirus originated to go house-to-house and send those infected to quarantine internment camps.
The Chinese government dramatically increased its coronavirus containment efforts in Wuhan, China, on Thursday and have begun implementing drastic new measures, according to the New York Times.
Chinese Vice Premier Sun Chunlan, 69, announced new procedures in the city of 11 million that include going to each home and checking the temperature of all residents.
“Set up a 24-hour duty system. During these wartime conditions, there must be no deserters, or they will be nailed to the pillar of historical shame forever,” Sun said on Thursday.
Sun ordered medical workers to go door-to-door to move any of those infected, with force, if necessary, to makeshift quarantine camps that include a convention center and other converted buildings. The country has already outlawed people from leaving Wuhan, and images from inside the converted stadium show tight rows of beds separated by just feet.
Some on Chinese social media evoked imagery from the 1918 Spanish Flu pandemic when comparing the draconian measures.
“It must be cut off from the source,” Sun told medical workers during a tour of one of the shelters. “You must keep a close eye. Don’t miss it.”
As of Thursday, more than 550 deaths and 28,088 infections have been officially reported in China, although experts believe that number could be far higher than authorities have said.
The death toll from the outbreak increased by 73 on Wednesday, its largest single-day jump. And on Thursday, the Chinese doctor who tried to warn the public early on about the illness and was subsequently punished by the government died after contracting the virus.
There have been 12 confirmed cases of the coronavirus in the United States, including through person-to-person contact. The World Health Organization declared the outbreak a global public health emergency as fears of a global pandemic grow.

Trump and GOP push to help plant 1 trillion trees won't be easy

Texto completo: President Trump and congressional Republicans are rallying around the idea of planting a trillion trees to boost their environmental credentials ahead of the 2020 election.
House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy of California touts planting trees, the Earth's "lungs," as the "most efficient way on the planet to capture carbon" emissions. He's co-authored legislation coming out soon that would be a vital plank of a broader GOP climate agenda. Trump has endorsed the concept, without citing climate change as the reason, announcing the United States would join an initiative for the world to plant a trillion trees.
While Republicans describe tree-planting as ready-made and easy to understand, it cannot alone make a big dent in cutting carbon, and it carries a host of practical, political, and scientific questions.
"Hypothetically, if we had a unified world government, we could do this relatively easily," said Seaver Wang, a climate and energy analyst at the Breakthrough Institute. "But even if we did it, a trillion trees don't dent emissions that much."
The concept spawned from remarks by an ecologist last year at a meeting held by the American Association for the Advancement of Science, who said that planting 1.2 trillion trees could "cancel out" the last decade of the world's carbon emissions.
"There is no limit to how much carbon we can store in wood," said Republican Rep. Bruce Westerman, a co-sponsor of the tree-planting bill with McCarthy, in a recent interview with the Washington Examiner.
The Republican bill would incentivize companies, nonprofit organizations, and individuals to plant trees domestically and abroad by creating "a framework for companies to donate seedlings and other resources," according to the discussion draft.
Thomas Crowther, the ETH Zurich ecologist who conceived of the 1.2 trillion trees idea and is now the chief scientific adviser to the United Nations's Trillion Tree Campaign, says there are 400 gigatons of carbon stored in the world's 3 trillion trees.
There are only 300 billion trees currently in the U.S.
Increasing the world's trees by another trillion could store the carbon equivalent of wiping out a decades' worth of accumulated emissions.
But Wang argues that's not as effective as policies that reduce fossil fuel use, given the emissions reduced from planting trees is a "one-time shot" compared to using zero-emission sources of energy in perpetuity. Most Republicans do not support policies such as carbon taxes or regulations that would lead to less fossil fuel use.
"We know trees alone are not enough by a long shot," Wang said.
Wang and other experts, however, acknowledge that planting trees and other so-called "natural solutions" are the most cost-effective and accessible carbon capture techniques compared to using machines to capture carbon from power or industrial plants or swipe it directly from the air.
"We can't think of this as a substitute for decarbonizing the economy," said Steven Hamburg, chief scientist of the Environmental Defense Fund. "But if we don't do this, the job gets much harder."
Wang said there is enough land in the world for a trillion more trees, but the space required for such a project would at least be half the size of the land area of China.
Accessing the land to plant trees would require cooperation across countries, governments, and local populations.
Some of the lands are privately owned and used for other purposes such as agriculture or grazing.
Another potential problem is that global warming is creating more difficult growing conditions for forests.
In the near term, Wang says, planting more trees may have a warming effect in certain parts of the world. Planting in high-latitude regions in the Northern Hemisphere could lead to forest cover darker than Earth's surface, causing it to absorb more heat, mainly when there's snow on the ground (think of wearing a black shirt in the sun compared to a lighter color). It's better to plant trees in tropical areas, but worsening extreme weather events such as droughts, floods, and wildfires put forests at risk of destruction, which would release the stored carbon.
"With a changing climate, we don't know how forests will hold up," Wang said.
Also, most current tree-planting programs pick only a few species to plant, which could make the forest more vulnerable to disease and destruction.
Another challenge is the possibility of public resistance to trading land used for food production for planting trees, given the need to feed the world's growing population.
"What we do with the world's extra land is an important question of what humanity will need," Wang said.
Experts say planting trees is not as effective as protecting them from being cut down in the first place because it takes decades for new forests to mature.
"We can plant all the trees we want, but it takes a lot of time for that carbon-storing reservoir to build up," said Wayne Walker, associate scientist at the Woods Hole Research Center.
Much of the northeast of the U.S. was deforested for agriculture in the 19th century. However, about 80% of that land has been naturally regenerated back to forest, according to Hamburg, because agriculture was not economically viable, and people left the land to pursue different trades.
"To get a forest back, you don't usually need to plant trees," Hamburg said. "You want natural regeneration if possible. It is usually faster, it gets higher biodiversity, and it's cheaper."
However, recent deforestation trends appear more permanent. Brazil's right-wing president, Jair Bolsonaro, has implemented policies in the Amazon aimed at deforestation in favor of business development. The Amazon, the world's largest rainforest, lost an area about 12 times the size of New York City from August 2018 through July 2019, according to government data reviewed by the New York Times.
"You want to absolutely eliminate deforestation as your highest priority," Hamburg said. "That will have the biggest rate of impact for addressing climate change. Reforesting is a much slower process of getting the same benefits."

Democratic senator claims GOP colleagues privately 'admit they acquitted Trump out of fear'

Texto completo: Sen. Sherrod Brown claimed his Republican colleagues are privately acknowledging that they acquitted President Trump out of fear and for self-preservation.
Brown, 67, wrote a Wednesday op-ed for the New York Times after Trump was acquitted on both articles of impeachment, during which Utah GOP Sen. Mitt Romney was the only member of his party who cast a vote to convict. The piece, titled "In Private, Republicans Admit They Acquitted Trump Out of Fear," began with a comparison to the 2002 Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq, which was up for a vote just weeks before that year's midterm elections.
The Ohio Democrat said the moment Rep. Adam Schiff read a CBS News report on the floor of the Senate trial, which alleged that a Trump confidant had threatened GOP members who were considering bucking the party on the vote, revealed to him that the California congressman "had clearly struck a nerve" with Republicans.
"In the words of Lizzo: truth hurts," he wrote, referencing the singer's hit song.
Brown went on to claim that congressional Republicans don't support the president for "what he delivers for them" because Vice President Mike Pence would do the same if he were in the Oval Office. Rather, he alleged, "They are afraid that Mr. Trump might give them a nickname like 'Low Energy Jeb' and 'Lyin’ Ted,' or that he might tweet about their disloyalty. Or — worst of all — that he might come to their state to campaign against them in the Republican primary."
He added, "In private, many of my colleagues agree that the president is reckless and unfit. They admit his lies. And they acknowledge what he did was wrong. They know this president has done things Richard Nixon never did. And they know that more damning evidence is likely to come out."
Despite his claim that Republicans have privately admitted their fears, Brown said that GOP members "stop short of explicitly saying that they are afraid" of Trump's future behavior.
"We all want to think that we always stand up for right and fight against wrong. But history does not look kindly on politicians who cannot fathom a fate worse than losing an upcoming election," he concluded. "They might claim fealty to their cause — those tax cuts — but often it’s a simple attachment to power that keeps them captured."

Texto completo: NowThis News was recently caught modifying the quote of a radical Leftist interview subject to protect her from looking like a Holocaust denier.
Last week, a CNN political analyst and former Clinton administration staffer confessed to making up news and sharing it on social media. And, of course, we just passed the anniversary of the great Covington Media Meltdown of 2019, where the media sought to smear a group of children for the crime of wearing a red Trump hats while smiling.
Bad news sells faster than good news, and we can’t really fault the media for pushing outrage to the front of the news cycle when legitimately outrageous things occur. But why on Earth would they fabricate outrage?
Some might suggest that this is a unique time in the history of news. But there are obvious similarities between today’s media landscape and the yellow journalism of the late 19th and early 20th century. Back then, William Randolph Hearst’s New York Journal competed with Joseph Pulitzer’s New York World to see who could publish the most sensational -- and least accurate -- stories.
But while the yellow journalists of the late 19th century helped incite an unnecessary war between the United States and Spain, today’s yellow journalists have helped incite a culture war of opposing political tribes. Each day, Americans consume their “news” of choice in order to see if they scored points on the other side, or if their “enemies” did anything outrageous. Many of these stories are blatantly false, but confirmation bias prevents the tribe members from that realization.
And today’s yellow journalism is far more dangerous than that of a century ago because seemingly everything in our culture is now politicized. Sporting events, award shows, social media and even fast-food restaurants are now opportunities for people to virtue-signal to their preferred tribe. The hyper-partisan media naturally seize upon this by stoking the flames of outrage whenever possible.
The problem is further compounded by the fact that our culture is now more fragmented than ever. Previously, leftists and conservatives might disagree on politics, but could bond over the love of the same movies, music, or television. But in the age of streaming music and streaming television, we all have our own favorite shows, films, and albums. Even on a good night, the highest rated prime-time TV show will garner ratings that would have easily gotten it cancelled a generation ago.
The end result is two warring political tribes that have seemingly nothing in common and will fight anywhere, anytime, about anything.
It’s undeniable that today’s reporters and columnists bear significant responsibility for causing our society to devolve into warring, vitriolic tribes. Are those clicks really worth it?
All of us, regardless of ideology, should be outraged over fake news and yellow journalism. The outrage flames stoked by the media are dividing workplaces, ending friendships, and damaging families. It’s ironic that the media loved hyping the stories of Vladimir Putin attempting to turn Americans against each other, when they have done a far better job than Putin ever could have.
We should all stand against political tribalism. You don’t need to define yourself by what outrages you. And any time you support 100% of the positions of a politician, it’s time for a little reflection. Focus on embracing principles rather than politicians. Politicians will betray you, but principles stand the test of time.
Furthermore, we should hold ourselves responsible for sharing fake news stories and for allowing ourselves to be manipulated by reporters and columnists.
And if CNN and The New York Times truly are the modern-day yellow journalists, we should pray that President Trump doesn’t become their William McKinley -- even if we didn’t vote for him.

Texto completo: Attorney General William Barr sent a memo to the FBI ordering the organization to clear any investigations into 2020 candidates with him.
Barr, 69, on Wednesday, issued restrictions requiring the agency to get his direct approval before launching an investigation into candidates to avoid the debacle that took place in 2016, according to the New York Times.
In 2016, the FBI was accused of influencing then-Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign after then-FBI Director James Comey cleared her of criminal wrongdoing in her email scandal but reopened the investigation days before the election.
The agency has also been criticized for its investigation into President Trump, which included obtaining a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrant to investigate Trump aide Carter Page. An investigation into the FISA process found that the FBI had broken protocol several times while obtaining the warrant, and the Department of Justice has since ruled that two FISA orders into Page were invalid.
Barr’s memo said it was the Justice Department’s duty to ensure elections are “free from improper activity or influences.” As a precaution, he required that all investigations into candidates or campaigns be approved by his office.
“In certain cases, the existence of a federal criminal or counterintelligence investigation, if it becomes known to the public, may have unintended effects on our elections,” Barr wrote, referencing Comey’s decision to make several public announcements about the investigation into Clinton.
He said that the FBI should still respond “swiftly and decisively” to any potential wrongdoing by a campaign but noted that the agency “must be sensitive to safeguarding the department’s reputation for fairness, neutrality and nonpartisanship.”
Barr’s memo required that written notification of any investigation into 2020 candidates or campaign be given to the attorney general’s office and any relevant department so that concerns about foreign security or criminal behaviors are sent to the proper leaders. He is the first attorney general to order that the FBI alert the department about this type of investigation.

‘Brave' and ‘principled’ Romney once threw a loyal gay aide under the bus to get ahead

Texto completo: The Senate voted to acquit President Trump on Wednesday in the least-surprising conclusion possible to the impeachment affair. The vote fell basically along party lines with a notable exception: Former 2012 GOP presidential nominee and Utah Sen. Mitt Romney voted “guilty” on the article of impeachment alleging Trump abused his power.
The vote itself isn’t absurd. Trump’s impeachment is a complicated enough issue that conservatives can disagree in good faith on whether or not the president’s conduct is worthy of removal, but, as far the post-vote liberal media fanfare and Never Trump applause lauding Romney as some sort of brave, principled hero is concerned? Give me a break. You might like or hate the senator’s impeachment vote, but, either way, he’s still an unprincipled hack.
Romney’s years of flip-flopping on gun rights, abortion, and even tax policy should be enough to prove that, but let's also take a quick trip down memory lane to his 2012 presidential campaign.
Not only did Romney blow with the wind when it came to gay rights — he supported gay rights until he didn’t — he threw a loyal gay Republican aide on his presidential campaign under the bus just because he faced backlash from some ignorant social conservatives who somehow thought a gay adviser would make Romney's foreign policy too gay, or something.
That aide, Richard Grenell, is now the highest-ranking gay official in the Trump administration. Trump has shown much more guts and principle than Romney ever did when it comes to standing by gay supporters.
Back in 2012, Grenell joined the Romney campaign after having served in the Bush administration. He had impeccable credentials, and he even came at the recommendation of GOP stalwarts such as John Bolton. Yet, after the criticisms started rolling in from anti-gay conservatives, the Romney campaign muzzled Grenell, even forbidding him to speak on an important foreign policy call he was expected to lead on. According to the New York Times, “Those close to Mr. Grenell ... insist that, when he had sought forceful support from those who had entrusted him with a major role, the campaign seemed to be focused, instead, on quieting a political storm that could detract from Mr. Romney’s message and his appeal to a crucial constituency.”
Romney officials claim that they tried to keep Grenell from resigning, but no one really believes that. It's pretty simple: Grenell had to resign because Romney didn’t have his back. Romney wasn’t “brave” or “principled” enough to tell anti-gay critics to pound sand when he thought it could cost him even slightly in the polls.
The liberal media might be willing to overlook Romney’s long history of spinelessness just because he’s now a rare Republican willing to say, “Orange man bad.” Just look at how they’ve glowingly received former "birther"-turned-Trump challenger Joe Walsh. I, for one, am not.

Gail Collins: Think the president has learned his lesson? Haha.

Texto completo: Pick the worst moment of the Senate impeachment hearings:
A) Susan Collins saying it’s OK to keep Donald Trump in office because he’s “learned from this case.”
B) A spokeswoman for Jim Risch claiming the senator was not sleeping but just “listening with his eyes closed.”
C) Mitch McConnell denouncing partisanship.
Well, the McConnell speech during Wednesday’s finale was pretty stunning. “Our adversaries seek to divide us against each other,” the majority leader told his colleagues, warning them not to become “consumed with partisan rancor.”
Nothing Mitch hates more than failure to be politically evenhanded. It’s probably one of the things he mulled frequently while sitting like a nesting hen on piles of Barack Obama’s judicial nominations.
Still, for the worst impeachment moment, I’m going with Susan Collins. The idea that Donald Trump had learned any lesson is ridiculous. Collins knows — the whole world knows — that Trump is a man with a learning curve that resembles a garter snake.
On the same day she delivered her theory as an excuse for voting for acquittal, the president discussed his Ukraine-related behavior at a lunch with television anchors. What do you think he said?
A) “All of life is a learning process.”
B) “Maybe I might concede I could possibly have done a little better.”
C) “It was a perfect call.”
Yeah, it’s C. You do know your president, don’t you?
Collins had made a splash by voting in favor of calling witnesses during the Senate’s impeachment trial. We live in times when agreeing to listen to people who know a lot about the matter you’re debating is an act of extreme daring.
Of course, the witness thing failed. Some dark minds believe that Collins’ moment of independence came only because McConnell knew he had enough votes to kill the proposal without her. Collins is heading toward a tough reelection in Maine this fall, and she needs bipartisan support. Perhaps, people of Maine, you haven’t noticed that your senator’s political independence tends to work best when the matter at hand is meaningless. Could be worse. At least she respects you enough to pander.
Many Senate Republicans settled on taking Trump’s side with a teeny tiny nod toward objectivity. (Lisa Murkowski went all the way for “shameful.”)
A few red state Democrats had a tough time, too. Doug Jones, who won that dramatic special election in Alabama and is generally regarded as the most endangered Democratic senator this fall, said deciding to support conviction cost him a lot of sleep.
“There will be so many who will simply look at what I am doing today and say it is a profile in courage,” he told the Senate. “It is not. It is simply a matter of right and wrong.”
Well, also an understanding that Jones’ surprise victory last time around was powered by a stupendous turnout by black women voters. Still, the Cook Political Report instantly downgraded his chances for reelection.
When the Senate voted to let Trump off the hook, the suspense had fizzled down to whether Democrat Joe Manchin would take a dive and whether Republican Mitt Romney would take a principled stand.
Manchin had tried desperately to find a way out by proposing the Senate merely censure the president for … trying to force an ally to find dirt on Joe Biden by withholding congressionally approved military aid. Nobody seemed to regard censure as a good plan, and Manchin voted to convict, depriving Trump of the chance to say he had bipartisan support.
Democrats of West Virginia, perhaps you find your senator a little slippery at times. But when you go to the polls, remember that one big day, he single-handedly made Donald Trump a little sad.
Romney, on the other hand, was an actual profile in courage. Mitt Romney! “I knew from the outset that being tasked with judging the president, the leader of my own party, would be the most difficult decision I have ever faced. I was not wrong,” he said emotionally.
He’s going to get a lot of grief from his Republican supporters. Still, remember that this is a wealthy 72-year-old with five years to go on his current Senate term.
Over his career, Romney’s had a history of taking principled stands and then backing off when things get tough. The Mitt who ran for governor of Massachusetts was an entirely different entity than the one who ran for the Republican presidential nomination. He was horrified by Donald Trump’s candidacy — vowed never to vote for him. Then there he was dining with the president-elect, lusting after a Cabinet post Trump had no intention of giving him.
Now, he’s erased a lot of bad memories. “Corrupting an election to keep oneself in office is perhaps the most abusive and destructive violation of one’s oath of office that I can imagine,” Romney said, voting to convict on abuse of power.
When history looks back on Mitt Romney, this should be the moment that gets remembered. Not the uninspiring presidential race or political flip-flops. Not even the time he drove to Canada with a dog on the roof of the car.

Texto completo: When my family emigrated from our native South Africa to Southern California in the 1980s, my parents, my sister and I fell hard for this state’s endless suburban sprawl. To the four of us, the acres of subdivisions that had been mushrooming up across California since World War II were the embodiment of everything we’d been promised about America. A bigger-than-enough house, a two-car garage and a backyard of brilliant green lawn — this was the California Dream we’d seen on TV.
By the time I got to middle school, my immigrant family was able to afford a house with a yard of our own — back then, California really was the land of milk and honey — and I spent my youth in the sun-drenched suburbs. It was a fine place to grow up; in the mass-produced “little boxes made of ticky-tacky” that stretch across California and much of America, I found comfort, safety and a crucial sense of belonging in the American landscape.
And yet, wistful though I may remain for my suburban-sprawl childhood, these days I find myself continually amazed and befuddled by my state’s insane fetishization of an anachronistic model of urban development. Why — when the case for some better way of living has become so painfully obvious — can’t California quit propping up its endless rows of single-family houses? Why can’t so much of America? And what level of extreme unlivability is it going to take to finally convince us that there isn’t enough space for all of us to live as if space is infinite?
Last week, California lawmakers rejected an effort to override restrictive zoning regulations across the state for the third year in a row. Most of the land available for residential development in California is zoned for single-family homes, according to researchers at U.C. Berkeley’s Turner Center for Housing Innovation; the typical California city allows multifamily developments like apartments, townhouses and duplexes on less than a quarter of its land. Senate Bill 50, devised by Scott Wiener, a Democrat from San Francisco, would have allowed higher-density housing near public transportation lines and job centers, fostering affordability and sustainability in a state that desperately needs both.
In previous attempts, Wiener’s idea was criticized for exacerbating gentrification and handing over development plans from local officials to state bureaucrats. This year, Wiener significantly amended the bill to address the critics’ concerns. The latest version offered greater control to local officials and delayed the legislation’s effect in low-income areas sensitive to gentrification.
But again, the bill couldn’t make it through. SB 50 attracted fierce opposition from lawmakers representing some of the state’s ritziest suburbs and its largest cities. Even some of the bill’s putative supporters, like Gov. Gavin Newsom, who is falling well short of his campaign promise to spur the development of 3.5 million new housing units by 2025, offered only tepid endorsements.
I suspect that the reluctance stems from a reality that many politicians would prefer to avoid accepting: The reign of the single-family home is over. Whatever its habitable charms and nostalgic appeal, the single-family home is out of step with the future.
In an era constrained by sustainability and affordability, a big house with a backyard should be a rarity. Much of California is straining under its own success: We have too many people and too few places for them to live, offered at too-high prices, in too many areas touched-by-climate-change-related menaces, like wildfires, all too far from where people work. And the solution is so painfully obvious it feels almost reductive to point it out: Make it legal to build more housing that houses more people.
Increasing density by replacing single-family homes with multifamily ones would be a boon to our efforts to address climate change, and it would help with affordability. But if that is too practical a selling point, let me offer a couple more politically salient ones.
First, there is nothing especially admirable about the development of single-family zoning in America. Though the policy is now defended as a way to maintain the ineffable “local character” of neighborhoods, single-family zoning has a history in segregation. As historian Richard Rothstein has documented, single-family zoning was one of the many ways white homeowners and politicians kept African Americans out of suburbs.
And second: We can move on from single-family housing to something better for everyone. A few years ago, shut out of the skyrocketing market for single-family homes in our Northern California suburb, my wife and I bought a townhouse. At first we thought of it as a starter home — we’d just had our second child, and it felt like we could slum it in a townhouse for a bit before we could move into the dream of a place with a backyard.
That dream now looks prohibitive: Houses with backyards in my neck of the woods require tech-IPO levels of insane wealth. But you know what? I don’t feel so bad. Our attached townhouse, on a piece of land a small fraction of the size of a single-family home, is less of a burden on the environment, and it is just the right size for the four of us. It’s also just as loving and pleasant a place for my kids to grow up in as my own suburban manse was for me.
At some point, recently, I realized that I no longer fantasized about ever having a backyard — my dream home is now a townhouse, and if it’s good enough for me, perhaps it could be good enough for others in my state, too.

Texto completo: On Wednesday I joined a majority of my Senate colleagues in opposing the impeachment of President Trump brought by the House of Representatives.
For four months, since the release of the memorandum of the call between President Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, I have consistently said that Mr. Trump’s request for an investigation of Joe Biden and any effort to tie the release of military aid to investigations were improper and shouldn’t have happened. However, I do not believe these actions rise to the level where it would be necessary to remove a president from office.
The founders intended for impeachment to be extremely rare, and they required those seeking to remove the president to meet the burden of proving “high crimes and misdemeanors,” like treason or bribery. In this case, unlike in other impeachments, no crime was alleged. Although there may be circumstances where a crime isn’t necessary for a president to be impeached, to be impeached under such a circumstance would require meeting an even higher bar, and it wasn’t met here.
In addition, the House engaged in a rushed process that lacked fundamental fairness. The constitutional law professor Jonathan Turley calls it “the shortest proceeding, with the thinnest evidentiary record, and the narrowest grounds ever used to impeach a president.” It was also the only purely partisan impeachment in history.
Rushing an impeachment case through the House without due process and giving the Senate a half-baked case to finish set a dangerous precedent. If the Senate were to convict, it would risk making this kind of quick, partisan impeachment in the House a regular occurrence. That would serve only to further deepen the divides that seem to permeate every part of our society today.
People certainly see this divide in Congress. Many believe their elected representatives on both sides of the aisle have lost sight of what’s important and are focusing on politics and partisanship rather than results for the American people.
While the Senate is where this impeachment process will end, it is also the Senate that is best suited to help turn the page and begin a new chapter. We can do that by demonstrating that we can work together and address the issues our constituents care most about. I believe it is possible for both parties to come together for consensus solutions on these three issues:
Lowering Prescription Drug Costs . Researchers are producing life-changing medicines, but all that progress does us no good if they’re unaffordable. It’s gotten so bad that some Americans have to choose between paying their mortgage or rent and being able to afford expensive prescription drugs. In the Senate, three committees have approved legislation intended to help lower out-of-pocket costs for senior citizens, crack down on the high prices set by drug manufacturers and end surprise billing practices that have devastated families with shocking medical bills. The House has its own plan. The president wants to get this done and there is no reason we should not be able to find common ground here.
Improving Skills Training . Everywhere I go in Ohio, employers tell me they need workers who have the skills to fill available jobs — well-paying work as welders, coders and health care technicians, all of which require skills training. I’m working with Senator Tim Kaine, a Virginia Democrat, to pass legislation called the JOBS Act to ensure that Pell grants can be used to cover short-term training programs for these careers. That would help fill well-paid, in-demand jobs and get more people off the sidelines and into our economy. This legislation is bipartisan, and ready to go.
Combating the Addiction Crisis . One area where Congress has worked well together is in combating the opioid epidemic. Significant new federal investment since 2016 is making a difference. Overdose deaths fell nationwide last year, the first time that’s happened in nearly three decades. Despite this progress, synthetic opioids like fentanyl remain a huge problem, and we’ve seen a resurgence of psychostimulants like crystal meth and cocaine. We’re working on bipartisan legislation to address these deadly threats.
And there’s more we can do, from infrastructure to retirement security to protecting our national parks. If Congress acts we can begin to re-instill faith in our institutions and bridge the growing partisan divide. In these highly partisan times, it’s easy for both sides of the aisle to retreat even further into their ideological camps. But for the sake of the country, let’s look for what unites us instead.

Texto completo: It is done. Donald Trump, impeached by the House of Representatives, has been acquitted by the Senate.
He acted with corrupt intent to pressure the government of Ukraine to announce an investigation into the Bidens. He withheld congressionally approved aid to do so. In so doing, he broke the law. Then he did everything he could to obstruct the inquiry looking into his crime.
He did these things. This is not in question anymore. Everyone paying attention to the evidence presented and that which continues to be revealed in the press knows this. Republicans in Congress know this.
However, all but one — Mitt Romney — have lined up behind Trump to support and defend him.
What we have watched in Washington from Republicans during this impeachment is nothing short of a travesty. Most people fully expected the Republicans in the Senate to do exactly what they did. However, it is still a strike against the country and the Constitution.
Where are we? What’s next?
I, for one, am happy that the Democrats in Congress did what they did. Indeed, they had no choice. A line had to be drawn and defended. If in fact no one in this country is supposed to be above the law, that case had to be made by someone. If the sanctity of our elections is supposed to be inviolable, that principle had to be defended.
Now that Republicans have refused to do their duty out of extreme tribalism and devotion to Trump, Democrats need to make lists and take names. There is no time for crestfallen recriminations.
Republicans who have chosen party and despot over country and law must be made to pay at the ballot box in November. If a majority of the Senate cannot be expected or made to do the right thing, the Senate majority must be changed. It must be defeated.
This has long since stopped being solely about Trump. This is about the whole of the Republican Party. Indeed, there is no longer a Republican Party. There is now only the Party of Trump. He is them; they are him.
Sure, most Republican senators are safe this cycle, but some are most definitely vulnerable. That vulnerability must be capitalized upon. They have to go. These are senators like Susan Collins of Maine, David Perdue of Georgia, Joni Ernst of Iowa, Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Martha McSally of Arizona.
Democrats and everyone else who believes in virtue must focus like a laser on those races, even if they do not live in those states. They must promote those senators’ opponents on social media. They must donate to those opponents if at all possible. They must encourage people in those states, particularly friends and relatives there, to get out the vote.
Anything that can be done to oust these Republican senators must be done. These races are just as important as the presidential race.
The impeachment trial gave Democrats ammunition to use against these Republican senators facing voters in November. With each vote Chuck Schumer forced on hearing new witnesses and collecting new documentary evidence, the incumbents put themselves on record in support of a sham process and a corrupt president.
As Politico reported last month, Democratic leaders think the Republicans will be seen as “Trump sycophants — undermining their bids and boosting Schumer’s odds of becoming majority leader.”
But Senate Democrats can’t do this alone. They need an internet army to come to their aid. They need an unrelenting campaign of ordinary citizens to keep these vulnerable Republicans under pressure and in the spotlight.
That means you!
The resistance must be widened. Control of the Senate must be at the center.
The Senate will be difficult to flip, but it is not impossible. And, like the impeachment of Donald Trump, America has no real choice.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - The U.S. Senate voted Wednesday to acquit President Donald Trump on abuse of power and obstruction of Congress charges and allow him to remain in office, ending the third impeachment trial in American history.
The Senate acquitted Mr. Trump by a 52-48 vote on the abuse of power charge and by a 53-47 vote on the obstruction of Congress charge.
Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, was the only Republican who broke with his party to join all 45 Democrats and two independents in voting "guilty" on the abuse of power charge. He became the first senator in U.S. history to vote to remove a president in his own party.
"The president is guilty of an appalling abuse of public trust," Mr. Romney said in a Senate floor speech before the vote. "Corrupting an election to keep oneself in office is perhaps the most abusive and destructive violation of one's oath of office that I can imagine."
Pennsylvania's senators were split on the verdict, with Democrat Bob Casey voting to convict and Republican Pat Toomey voting to acquit on both charges.
The result of Wednesday's verdict was not a surprise: From the outset, it was highly unlikely the Republican-controlled Senate would get to the 67 votes required for Mr. Trump's removal. The previous two presidential impeachment trials resulted in acquittals for Andrew Johnson in 1868 and Bill Clinton in 1999.
The acquittal, coming hours after Mr. Trump delivered a defiant State of the Union address, brings to a close a four-month investigation and trial that paralyzed much of Capitol Hill and exposed deep partisan divides.
Several moderate Democrats, hailing from states that voted overwhelmingly for Mr. Trump, decided to vote "guilty."
Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., who earlier in the week proposed the Senate censure the president instead of removing him from office, ultimately voted to convict on both charges. West Virginia voted for Mr. Trump in 2016 by 42 percentage points.
Sen. Doug Jones, D-Ala., voted to convict as he faces a difficult re-election fight in a deep-red state. Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz., did the same.
In its verdict, the Senate ultimately sided with White House defense lawyers who argued that Mr. Trump's actions to pressure Ukraine into announcing an investigation into a political rival did not meet the constitutional standard for removing a president from office.
The chamber rejected the arguments and evidence presented by a team of six House Democrats who prosecuted the case against Mr. Trump.
The House Democrats accused Mr. Trump of abusing his power by freezing nearly $400 million in military aid to Ukraine and delaying a White House meeting with its new president to extort the American ally into helping his prospects in this November's election.
Mr. Trump, the Democrats asserted, demanded that Ukraine announce a probe into a Ukrainian energy firm, Burisma, on whose board sat Hunter Biden, son of former Vice President Joe Biden.
In December, the House voted 228-187 to impeach Mr. Trump, setting the stage for the trial.
Much of Mr. Trump's trial was consumed in a furious debate, mostly behind the scenes, over whether to call witnesses who refused to testify or issue subpoenas for documents the White House refused to turn over.
Senators voted at the start of the trial to reject calling witnesses and documents. And, on Friday, after hearing 36 hours of arguments and questioning the prosecution and defense, senators voted again to reject the move. That vote effectively brought the trial to a close.
The rejection of witnesses was unprecedented in Senate impeachment trials of both presidents and federal judges. The Senate called 41 witnesses in Andrew Johnson's trial and called three witnesses for private depositions in Mr. Clinton's trial.
But Mr. Trump's acquittal, coming about nine months before the 2020 presidential election, is unlikely to put to rest the underlying accusations of the case.
New revelations are expected to leak out from witnesses that the Senate declined to call and, eventually, from documents the White House refused to provide.
John Bolton, Mr. Trump's former national security adviser, plans to publish an explosive book in March that reportedly details direct conversations with the president about the hold on Ukraine aid. The Senate voted to reject Democrats' efforts to call Mr. Bolton as a witness.
Mr. Bolton, whose book is called "The Room Where It Happened: A White House Memoir," resigned in September days before the impeachment inquiry started.
Mr. Romney, in his floor speech Wednesday, said he wanted to hear from Mr. Bolton "not only because I believed he could add context to the charges, but also because I hoped that what he might say could raise reasonable doubt and thus remove from me the awful obligation to vote for impeachment."
The House's next steps to get more answers from Mr. Bolton are unclear.
Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., chair of the House Intelligence Committee, said on "Meet The Press" on Sunday that "the truth will come out" whether "it's in testimony before the House or it's in his book."
On Monday, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., another House impeachment manager, promised that "whatever happens in this impeachment trial, we will remain vigilant in the House."
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., criticized the Senate proceeding as a sham. "You cannot be acquitted if you don't have a trial," she told reporters last Thursday.
Meanwhile, two Republican senators filed a request for travel records for the Bidens.
Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, and Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., sent a letter to Secret Service Director James Murray as part of a probe into "potential conflicts of interest posed by the business activities of Hunter Biden and his associates during the Obama administration."
Mr. McConnell, in his floor speech Wednesday, acknowledged the political fighting over Mr. Trump's case will continue.
"This episode is one of a symptom of something much deeper," he said. "One side has decided that defeat simply means the whole system is broken."
"There is no sign the attacks on our institution will end here," Mr. McConnell added. He criticized Ms. Pelosi's remarks that she would not recognize the verdict.
"Perhaps she'll tear up the verdict like she tore up the State of the Union address," Mr. McConnell said, referring to Ms. Pelosi's act of ripping Mr. Trump's speech in half on national television. "Is this really where you want to go?"
Through it all, American public opinion has been split almost exactly down the middle on impeachment.
A Pew Research Center survey published Jan. 22 found 51% of Americans believe Mr. Trump should be removed from office. The research organization conducted that survey among 12,638 U.S. adults over two weeks ending Jan. 19.
The verdict also marked the final moments for John Roberts, chief justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, to preside in the Senate chamber. He directed a clerk to read the full text of the two articles and then asked senators, "how say you?" in response to the charges.
One by one, senators rose from their desks and issued their verdict - shouting "guilty" or "not guilty" - as the clerk called on them to respond.
After the votes were tallied, Mr. Roberts declared the president "is hereby acquitted of said charges."

Cal Thomas: After Trump’s acquittal, what’s next?

Texto completo: Just because the Senate has acquitted President Trump of charges Republicans believed never rose to the level of “high crimes and misdemeanors,” don’t think Democrats will raise the white flag of surrender. They (and their media allies) have only just begun.
Next is a campaign to defeat enough of the 23 Republican senators up for re-election and, if possible (it doesn’t look possible, but this is February), keep President Trump from winning re-election.
<img class="size-medium wp-image-2656862" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2019/02/Cal-Thomas-Color-300x190.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="190" />
Democrats have virtually no issues on which to run, except the promise of free stuff — from Elizabeth Warren’s student loan forgiveness plan, which does nothing for those who struggled to pay off their student loans without assistance, to Bernie Sanders’ free Medicare for All.
A new Gallup poll released last week shows how difficult it will be for Democrats.
According to Gallup, 41 percent of Americans “are satisfied with the way things are going in the U.S.” That’s the highest satisfaction level in 15 years. Seventy-two percent of Republicans are satisfied, a number likely to grow if the economy remains strong and there is stability in international affairs. Only 14 percent of Democrats are satisfied. That is likely, in part, because President Trump is racking up success after success without any cooperation from the other party. If Democrats had cooperated on at least some issues (other than the new trade agreement between the U.S., Canada and Mexico) they might have been able to legitimately claim some credit, but their opposition to all things Trump and their attempts to undo the results of the 2016 election leaves them out in the political cold.
What is most remarkable about this Gallup poll is that it was taken in the middle of the Senate impeachment trial and in the face of some of the most hostile media coverage any president has ever had to endure in modern times.

According to the conservative Media Research Center, which monitors the broadcast network’s evening news programs, “… evening news coverage of the opening arguments of both sides, found ABC, CBS, and NBC did not live up to the standard they demanded of Republicans. They gave Democrats double the airtime and showered their arguments with mostly praise, while expressing only criticism of the President’s legal team.”
The New York Times and Washington Post have cast aside any cloak of fairness by going anti-Trump nonstop. Their news coverage, editorials and virtually all of their columnists are constantly looking for new ways to express opposition to and hatred of the president. One advantage for readers is that it is easier to get through those papers because they have become predictable and tiresome.
Democrats may feel good about this as they keep company with their media fellow travelers, but President Trump is newly empowered to take his case for four more years of prosperity and relative peace to the public. Every Democrat running for president would raise taxes, giving more money to Washington, which cannot constrain its spending lust under either party. As taxes rise, so would unemployment because many businesses would no longer be able to afford workers they hired during the economic boom.
Look for more investigations — perhaps additional allegations and articles of impeachment — and more “leaks” from former Trump staffers between now and the election. The only way to stop this is for Republicans to regain a House majority and maintain their majority in the Senate.
Barring an unforeseeable disaster (always a possibility), Trump is positioned to win re-election, perhaps in a landslide, which will send the left and most of the media into another deep depression.

Texto completo: MANCHESTER, NEW HAMPSHIRE —
With no final results yet from the Democratic Party caucuses in Iowa held three days ago, Bernie Sanders on Thursday decided to declare victory based on the results so far, basing his declaration on his lead in the popular vote in the caucuses, as Sanders jockeyed with Pete Buttigieg to grab a boost for next week's New Hampshire Primary.
"That screwup has been extremely unfair to the people of Iowa," Sanders said of the vote counting fiasco during a news conference at his New Hampshire headquarters.
"What has happened with the Iowa Democratic Party is an outrage, that they were that unprepared," Sanders added. "It has been unfair to the candidates, all of the candidates and all of their supporters."
"We won an eight person election by some six thousand votes," Sanders added, focusing on the first ballot popular vote taken at the Iowa Caucuses, expressing frustration with the entire situation.
Buttigieg has declared victory based on a separate metric in those same results, the number of state delegates to the Iowa Democratic Party convention, where Buttigieg has a slight edge.
As of Thursday, 97 percent of precincts from Iowa's Democratic Party caucuses have reported their results, though the New York Times reported that the results were 'riddled with efforts and inconsistencies.'
The remarks of Sanders from his New Hampshire headquarters came as the national Democratic Party chief, Tom Perez, called for a 'recanvass' of the Iowa votes to make sure the results were correct.
"Enough is enough," Perez stated on Twitter.

Enough is enough. In light of the problems that have emerged in the implementation of the delegate selection plan and in order to assure public confidence in the results, I am calling on the Iowa Democratic Party to immediately begin a recanvass.
— Tom Perez (@TomPerez) February 6, 2020
An analysis from @UpshotNYT found that data from more than 100 Iowa precincts was either "internally inconsistent," missing data or "not possible under the complex rules". The Times reported it does not appear to benefit Buttigieg or Sanders, overall https://t.co/oL2PpxNqvT pic.twitter.com/dzaJvpRMtv
— Zach Montellaro (@ZachMontellaro) February 6, 2020
Meanwhile, there was no sign the Iowa results would be official by next Tuesday, when New Hampshire votes in the Granite State's first-in-the-nation primary.
"Maybe we might want the decisions of the Iowa caucus before the November election," Sanders said.

Texto completo: It’s a busy time for fans of Ali Wong. First, there’s her appearance in the new DC comics superheroine film “Birds of Prey,” opening nationwide Friday, Feb. 7, and next week on Feb. 15, she’ll bring her “Milk & Money” standup comedy tour to Santa Rosa’s Luther Burbank Center for the Arts. Then she returns to her hometown, San Francisco, for live shows at Feb. 16-17 at the Masonic.
“Birds of Prey (and the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn)” stars Margot Robbie, reprising her role from the 2016 film “Suicide Squad” as Harley Quinn, the Joker’s protege.
Wong will appear in the film as an associate of Renee Montoya, a Gotham City detective turned vigilante, played by Rosie Perez. The film, directed by Cathy Yan from a script by Christina Hodson (“Bumblebee”) also features Jurnee Smollett-Bell as Black Canary, Mary Elizabeth Winstead as The Huntress and Ewan McGregor as Black Mask. Ella Jay Basco makes her film debut as street urchin Cassandra Cain.
Wong, who started her standup comedy career in San Francisco and now lives in Los Angeles, attended San Francisco University High School and graduated from UCLA before launching her standup comedy career in New York City.
“I came from this really atypical Asian-American family. My parents were not focused on academics. If I got a bad grade, they weren’t that upset,” Wong told TIME magazine last year.
She made her first Netflix stand-up special, “Baby Cobra,” in May 2016, when she was seven months pregnant. She joked frankly about sex, pregnancy and social injustice, and the show was a resounding hit, especially with women.
“I can’t tell you how many selfies I’ve gotten asked for at the gynecologist and pediatrician office,” she told The New York Times in a 2018 interview. “I should sell tickets there.”
Her second Netflix special, “Hard Knock Wife,” premiered on Mother’s Day in 2018. When “Always Be My Maybe” — starring Wong as an ambitious celebrity chef reunited with her best male friend after 15 years — premiered on Netflix last May, it was seen by 32 million viewers in its first four weeks.
Her book — “Dear Girls: Intimate Tales, Untold Secrets & Advice for Living Your Best Life” — made the New York Times bestseller list last year.
“I lost my virginity when I was like 15 — you read about all the bad stuff I did,” she told TIME in a 2019 interview.
Wong will perform two shows in Santa Rosa, at 7 p.m. and 10 p.m., but the first performance is already sold out. Tickets are still available for the late performance, added Jan. 14, with prices ranging from $49.50 to $119.50. Go to lutherburbankcenter.org or call 707-546-3600. Both of the Masonic shows start at 7 p.m. and ticket prices range from $69 to $149. Go to masonic.com
No cell phones, cameras or recording devices will be allowed at the Burbank Center show. Upon arrival, all phones and smart watches will be secured in Yondr pouches that will be unlocked at the end of the show. Guests will maintain possession of their phones throughout the night, and if needed, may access them at designated unlocking stations.

Kristof: The Grinch that fired an angel

Texto completo: To understand how some companies have lost their souls, consider what happened after U.S. Bank stiffed a customer before Christmas.
Marc Eugenio had deposited a $1,080 paycheck into his account at U.S. Bank. The bank put a hold on most of the sum, and he spent many hours in a branch office over two days, trying to get access to the money so he could buy presents for his 9-year-old daughter and 13-year-old son.
On Christmas Eve, Eugenio found himself parked at a gas station in Clackamas, Oregon, a Portland suburb, both his fuel gauge and his bank balance on empty. A bank employee had told him that money would soon show up in his account — perhaps a ruse to get him out of the branch office. For hours Eugenia then tried his debit card at the gas pump so he could buy a few gallons and get home to his wife and children.
“I was stranded,” he told me. “I could have walked home, but it would have been 5 miles in the cold.”
That’s when Eugenio found an angel.
He telephoned the bank’s toll-free number and spoke with Emily James, a senior officer at a call center in Portland. She spent an hour on the phone with Eugenio, trying to get some money released so he could at least get home. She soon realized that he had been misled, and that money wouldn’t reach his account any time soon. Feeling bad for a customer stuck on Christmas Eve, James offered to drive over from her call center and personally hand him $20.
“No, no, no,” Eugenio told her. He couldn’t impose. But she suggested she could use her break, and she received permission from a supervisor to drive 20 minutes to Eugenio. She later recalled that when she arrived, she wished him Merry Christmas and handed him $20 of her own money.
“Twenty dollars wouldn’t break me,” she explained to me, “and it would enable him to get home to his family.”
When U.S. Bank found out that it had such a generous employee, what did it do? It fired her.
“She broke the rules, putting herself and the bank at unnecessary risk,” U.S. Bank said in a statement. The company bars call center workers from meeting customers, so it dismissed both her and the manager who had approved her trip. The manager, Abigail Gilbert, told me that James’ account was essentially correct.
James had worked at the bank since 2017 and had received numerous commendations and awards that I examined, but the bank paid her no severance. She is single and used her last paycheck to buy sacks of food for her two dogs, Domino and Harley Quinn. She is now reduced to selling blood plasma, at $25 a visit.
“I won’t let myself be homeless,” she told me.
Eugenio is horrified at what happened. “I was lied to and treated like dirt” by the bank, Eugenio said, and he can’t understand why the bank axed the one employee who was helpful. “I felt really bad,” he told me. “How could she get fired?”
U.S. Bank’s vision statement boasts: “Our employees are empowered to do the right thing.” So I tried to ask the company’s CEO, Andrew Cecere, why the bank fired an employee who, with permission, rescued a frustrated customer on Christmas Eve.
Cecere wouldn’t return my calls. David Palombi, a bank spokesman, told me that an internal “investigation” had concluded that James misled Gilbert to get permission, that James could have found other ways to get money to Eugenio, that the $20 came from the manager (which Gilbert confirmed to me) and that James previously had disciplinary “issues.” I found the bank’s “investigation” a whitewash and its explanations to be incoherent, meanspirited and contradicted by a series of internal bank messages that I reviewed.
The bottom line is this: Cecere, who was paid $14.1 million in 2018, presides over a company that has smeared a much-decorated employee who helped a customer and as a result survives by selling blood plasma. I suggest Cecere apologize, reinstate James and promote her; he might also show contrition by selling his own blood plasma and donating the proceeds to a charity of James’ choosing.
When young Americans say in polls that they react more positively to “socialism” than to “capitalism,” it’s because of the hypocrisy of institutions like U.S. Bank.
I’ve often noted that companies have enormous capacity to help their communities. But too often they act like U.S. tobacco companies, which killed more people than Stalin did, or pharma companies peddling opioids, or McKinsey & Co. advising a business to “get more patients on higher doses of opioids,” or Boeing mocking regulators. That’s one reason to seek stronger private-sector labor unions: At least unions and corporations can then provide some check on each other.
One bit of reassurance: Some chief executives do seem more enlightened than Cecere. After the Oregonian wrote two excellent articles about James, other companies reached out to her, saying that she’s the kind of caring person they want to attract.
“No job offers yet,” she told me, “but there are a couple of possibilities I’m really excited by.”

Kobe Bryant's books surging in popularity

Texto completo: Books created by Kobe Bryant's content company soared in popularity in the days following the basketball legend's death in a helicopter crash.
A trio of the books created by Bryant's Granity Studios will occupy the top three spots on the Middle Grade Hardcover portion of The New York Times' best-seller list for Feb. 16. "Epoca: The Tree Of Ecrof" will be No. 1 on that list, followed by "Legacy And The Queen" and "The Wizenard: Training Camp."
All three of the books were written for children between the ages of 10 and 14. Bryant, in an interview with The Associated Press in 2018, said his mission for the books was "to combine education and inspiration and build around the concepts of what kids go through when they are playing a sport."
Another of Bryant's books, "The Mamba Mentality: How I Play" has also reached No. 1 on Amazon's non-fiction sales charts this week. Bryant released that book in 2018, the same year that he won an Academy Award in the best animated short for his ode to the game called "Dear Basketball."
Granity additionally produces a podcast series called "The Punies," tales about a boy who plays sports with friends. Bryant was also the creator and writer of the "Detail" sports analysis series of programs on ESPN, and Granity has said it will continue as Bryant wanted - "using creative education to inspire people to be the best versions of themselves."
Feinstein calls for crash-warning systems
LOS ANGELES - U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein is calling for federal rules that crash-warning systems be required on commercial helicopters like the one that crashed in foggy weather last month outside Los Angeles, killing Kobe Bryant and eight other people.
The helicopter carrying Bryant and the others did not have a device called the Terrain Awareness and Warning System that signals when an aircraft is in danger of hitting ground. The National Transportation Safety Board had recommended the system be required for helicopters. But the Federal Aviation Administration only requires it for air ambulances.
BASEBALL
Reds complete 1-year deal with Pedro Strop
CINCINNATI - The Reds completed a one-year, $1,825,000 deal with right-hander Pedro Strop on Wednesday, their first move to upgrade the bullpen in an offseason focused on offense.
Strop, 34, was part of the Cubs' bullpen the last six years. A hamstring injury limited him to 50 appearances last season, when he went 2-5 with a 4.97 ERA, 10 saves and six blown saves.
Strop had a rough middle of the season after returning from the injury. He went 1-1 with four blown saves in July and 0-1 with a 9.00 ERA and one save in August. He finished strong, putting up a 2.00 ERA in 11 appearances in September.
Cubs invite Morrow to spring training
CHICAGO - The Cubs announced former closer Brandon Morrow's minor league contract on Wednesday and said he will report to big league spring training.
If added to the 40-man roster, Morrow would get a one-year contract paying a $1.5 million salary while in the major leagues and a $150,000 salary while in the minors.
Yankees lefty Paxton has back surgery
NEW YORK - Yankees left-hander James Paxton had back surgery Wednesday and is expected to be sidelined until May or June. New York said Dr. Andrew Dossett in Dallas performed a microscopic lumbar discectomy, in which a herniated disk is repaired, and removed a peridiscal cyst. The Yankees estimated Paxton's timeline to pitch in a major league game is three to four months.
Twins, Tigers to play in Dominican Republic
ORLANDO, Fla. - Major League Baseball is returning to the Dominican Republic for the first time in 20 years, with the Minnesota Twins and the Detroit Tigers playing a spring training game in Santo Domingo on March 7.
MLB has never played a regular-season game in the Dominican Republic. The last exhibition there was between Boston and Houston in 2000 at Estadio Quisqueya Juan Marichal, also the site of this year's game.
Braves beat Greene in salary arbitration
PHOENIX - The Atlanta Braves defeated Shane Greene in the first salary arbitration case this year, and the reliever will be paid $6.25 million instead of his request for $6.75 million.
Arbitrators Gary Kendellen, Brian Keller and Allen Ponak made the decision Wednesday, a day after hearing arguments. A 31-year-old right-hander, Greene was a first-time All-Star last year, when he made $4 million.
FOOTBALL
Arizona State names Lewis a co-coordinator
TEMPE, Ariz. - Arizona State has named Marvin Lewis and Antonio Pierce as co-defensive coordinators.
Head coach Herm Edwards made the announcement Tuesday. Lewis, a coaching veteran of 25 years in the NFL, joined the program in 2019 as a special adviser and served as interim defensive backs coach in the 2019 Sun Bowl. He spent 16 seasons as the Cincinnati Bengals' head coach, setting team records with 131 wins, seven playoff appearances and four division titles. Pierce played nine NFL seasons with Washington and the New York Giants, winning a Super Bowl with the Giants in 2007.
Kitchens among additions to Giants
EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. - Recently fired Cleveland Browns coach Freddie Kitchens has been hired as the New York Giants tight end coach.
New coach Joe Judge announced his 20-member staff on Wednesday, retaining six men from Pat Shurmur's staff. Judge previously announced that former Cowboys coach Jason Garrett would be his offensive coordinator and Patrick Graham would handle the defense. Thomas McGaughey was retained as the special teams coach.
HOCKEY
Bruins edge Blackhawks in overtime
CHICAGO - Charlie McAvoy scored 1:18 into overtime to lift the Boston Bruins past the Chicago Blackhawks on Wednesday night at the United Center.
Chicago's Alex DeBrincat and Boston's Sean Kuraly scored in the second period.

At Marco's Italian and American Foods, consistency is the name of the game.
"Our motto is consistency, keep things the same and just work hard," said Frank Cannavo, one of the owners of the restaurant that is celebrating its 60th anniversary in downtown Dubuque. "We're an old-school family restaurant, not trying to be anything more or anything less."
Ever since Frank's uncle Marco Giunta opened Marco's in 1960 with his wife, Carmela Cannavo, the business has been a family affair.
After waiting tables and delivering pizzas as a teenager, Frank, 45, now owns the business with his cousin Franco Cannavo, 58.
In an industry in which Frank said restaurants always try to one-up each other with exotic offerings, Marco's works hard to keep it old school. Everything is made from scratch in-house, from meatballs to the restaurant's famous pizza and hot spaghetti.
Nothing is ever frozen, meaning that sometimes popular dishes will run out. Frank said younger employees accustomed to technology sometimes shake their heads at the restaurant's old-fashioned ways.
The 60-year run seems to show that the family-owned business is doing something right, not to mention the accolades that Marco's has received through the years. They have been recognized in the New York Times, Chicago Tribune and Washington Post. Famous customers have graced the restaurant, as well, including former late-night television host Jay Leno in 2006.
"(He) picked up a pizza himself at the restaurant and sent us an autographed picture saying, 'Best pizza ever,'" said Frank. "People still talk about that."
He said positive recognition always makes the team proud, "especially when it's an NBC letter," but praise from local customers means just as much.
"They pop their heads into the kitchen and say, 'Great meal,' and it makes you feel good," he said. "We wouldn't be around for 60 years without the customers coming here."
Franco agreed.
"The customers are like family," he said. "We treat them like family, and they treat us the same."
Andy Schroeder has been a Marco's regular for more than 35 years. As a kid, he went with his dad to pick up a pizza at least once per week and enjoyed a kiddie cocktail at the bar while they waited. He remembers chatting with Frank and his dad, Carmelo, in the kitchen.
Now, he carries on the tradition with his children, ages 11 and 13, and pops into the kitchen to catch up on sports and family news with Frank.
"It's a family environment, and who they are today is who they were 60 years ago," he said. "Frank is doing exactly what his dad did, and the way the siblings and cousins have kept the business in the family for generations emulates what Marco's has done for our family."
The restaurant also is a family tradition for Jane Roussel, who started coming to Marco's more than 20 years ago with her parents, Jerry and Bonnie. Though Bonnie died in 2019, Jane and her father stop in at least once per week.
"We have a standing reservation," she said.
During the past 60 years, the Giuntas and Cannavos have watched the local restaurant scene change dramatically.
Of course, prices were lower in the early years. Frank recalls an early menu that priced a pizza at $1.25.
The restaurant's delivery service, now commonplace in the industry, was a novelty in the 1960s, and the increase in franchise restaurants also caused ripples in the industry for small, family-owned businesses.
But even as the arrival of new chain restaurants to Dubuque has sparked enthusiasm, Marco's maintains a strong following. Schroeder attributed this to the restaurant's emphasis on quality.
"They've been able to maintain such a high level of service and quality that over the course of time, even with (the demand) for fast, cheap food, people go to Marco's because they've been able to maintain that consistency," he said. "It's not just a bunch of people in a kitchen cooking. They come out and walk through the dining room to make sure people are enjoying their food."
Roussel agreed that the restaurant's "personal touch" is what keeps her coming back.
"They're part of the community, so they care about the community, so they get to know their customers and they really care that people like what they're serving," she said. "That's what's nice about a family-owned business - you're not just a number. They have that at-home feeling."
Marco's might face more changes in the near future, as city officials focus on the Central Avenue corridor. The plans being discussed include improving lighting and converting Central Avenue from a one-way street to two-way traffic.
Frank and Franco plan to take these changes in stride.
"If lighting and all that gets improved down here, I think that refurbishing is going to go a long way to improving how people view the area down here, changing people's mentality," Frank said.
Even as their neighborhood and industry change around them, Frank and Franco don't plan any drastic updates at Marco's. They said the simplicity and unchanging style are what keep the customers coming back.
"We have customers come in and tell us, 'Man, you guys better not change a thing,'" Frank said. "It's nostalgic."
Roussel agreed that the restaurant's consistency is part of its charm.
"You walk into that dining area, and it hasn't changed since Mom and Dad were there in 1961," she said. "Same atmosphere, same good food and same good people."

Texto completo: CHILD CARE
Au pair agency leaving Massachusetts in wake of minimum wage ruling A California-based au pair agency is pulling out of Massachusetts on the heels of a December federal court ruling that foreign childcare providers must be paid the state minimum wage, raising families' weekly costs by as much as $333 a week. EurAupair matches au pairs with about 30 families in Massachusetts every year, 20 of whom have decided to continue until their contract is up. But the agency, which has been placing caregivers here since it started in 1989, won't send any new au pairs to Massachusetts due to the court ruling, said President Bill Gustafson. Go Au Pair, in Utah, said that more than a third of its host families in Massachusetts have left the program due to the cost increase but doesn't anticipate ending operations in the state until families stop seeking out au pairs. About 1,500 au pairs are placed in Massachusetts a year by 13 agencies around the country, according to the State Department, which runs the program. No other departures have been announced, but the newly formed advocacy group Au Pair Families of Massachusetts expects other agencies to end operations here, too. The court ruling technically applies to every state with minimum wages above the federal rate and could affect the entire program. — KATIE JOHNSTON
ENERGY
Federal lawmakers ask GAO to investigate slow approval of renewable energy projects Frustrated by permitting delays, members of the Massachusetts congressional delegation have asked the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office to investigate the Trump administration's review and approval of fossil fuel and renewable energy projects. Their Feb. 5 letter to the GAO raises the concern that the Trump administration is using a double standard: expediting fossil fuel projects while slowing down renewable energy projects. The letter doesn't mention Vineyard Wind by name but that Massachusetts project, planned by Avangrid and Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners, would be the first major offshore wind farm built in the United States. It has been beset by permitting delays at the federal level. The letter was drafted by Senator Elizabeth Warren's office. Signatories included Warren, Senator Edward Markey, and Representatives Joseph Kennedy, Richard Neal, William Keating, James McGovern, Katherine Clark, Seth Moulton, and Lori Trahan, all Democrats. — JON CHESTO
SOCIAL MEDIA
Twitter gains daily users Twitter topped analysts' projections for fourth-quarter revenue and added more new daily users than expected, citing product improvements and more personalized content on its social network. The shares rose the most in almost a year. Revenue rose 11 percent to $1.01 billion, slightly higher than the $994.5 million predicted in a Bloomberg analyst survey. The company added 7 million daily active users in the period, and now has 152 million people logging in daily on average, up 21 percent from the same period a year earlier. — BLOOMBERG NEWS
ECONOMY
Productivity growth at record level in 2019 US productivity rebounded in the final three months of last year, helping to boost productivity growth for the year to the best showing in nearly a decade. The Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics said Thursday that productivity grew at an annual rate of 1.4 percent in the October-December quarter, reversing the direction of a 0.2 percent drop during the third quarter. For the year, productivity increased 1.7 percent, up from 1.3 percent advances in both 2017 and 2018. While a 1.7 percent rise in productivity is considered modest, it was the best annual showing since a 3.4 percent advance in 2010. — ASSOCIATED PRESS
MEDIA
New York Times dismisses notion of 'Trump bump' The New York Times doesn't want to hear about the “Trump bump" anymore. The publisher said a broad array of news coverage helped to power a continued rise in digital subscriptions last quarter, with earnings and revenue beating analysts' expectations. The results caused Times Company shares to jump more than 12 percent and reach their highest point in 15 years. Industry analysts have often linked the Times' dramatic growth in digital subscribers to President Trump's unique ability to create a never-ending news cycle that attracts more readers. On an earnings call Thursday, Times Company chief executive Mark Thompson sought to put that notion to rest, calling it a “faulty analysis" and saying the Times doesn't rely on a single story anymore to attract customers. He cited the paper's breadth of journalism, including recent coverage of the coronavirus, fires in Australia, the death of Kobe Bryant, and Prince Harry and Meghan Markle giving up their royal titles. — BLOOMBERG NEWS
HIGHER EDUCATION
Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, UMass Lowell team up A Maine naval shipyard and the University of Massachusetts Lowell have entered into an educational partnership to share technology and enhance student education. The five-year agreement between Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, located in Kittery, Maine, and UMass was signed at a ceremony Tuesday, the Portsmouth Herald reported. It will allow the Navy to make its scientific, engineering, and technology assets and subject matter experts available to university faculty. In turn, the Navy is able to involve UMass Lowell faculty and students in innovative projects underway at the shipyard. — ASSOCIATED PRESS
RETAIL
Coach parent company beats expectations but offers a warning The luxury brand Tapestry handily beat quarterly profit expectations but warned that the virus outbreak in China is “significantly impacting" its business. The owner of Coach and Kate Spade said Thursday that the majority of its stores in China are now closed. Meanwhile, Tapestry announced Thursday that Liz Fraser has been named CEO and brand president of Kate Spade. The Kate Spade label has been the weaker spot within the Tapestry portfolio. — ASSOCIATED PRESS
MORTGAGES
Rates keep going down Mortgage rates continued to decline, giving homebuyers a crack at the lowest borrowing costs in more than three years. The average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage was 3.45 percent, down from 3.51 percent last week and the lowest since July 2016, Freddie Mac data showed Thursday. The 15-year average slipped to 2.97 percent from 3 percent. — BLOOMBERG NEWS
FAST FOOD
Pizza Hut continues to struggle Yum! Brands Inc. fell after its Pizza Hut chain weighed on fourth quarter results and the company said the virus outbreak in China will be a headwind this year. Pizza Hut's same-stores sales, a key measure for retailers, dropped by a more-than-estimated 2 percent in the fourth quarter, according to a statement. Yum! Brands chief executive David Gibbs said that the deadly coronavirus may impact the company — which still generates revenue from Asia — and that it was closely monitoring the situation. — BLOOMBERG NEWS
TRANSPORTATION
Senators criticize slow progress on rail tunnel Fifteen Democratic Senators admonished the Trump administration for the sluggish progress on a new rail tunnel between New York and New Jersey, centerpiece of the so-called Gateway program of major infrastructure projects in the critical transit artery. In a letter Thursday, the Democrats, including minority leader Chuck Schumer of New York, Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, urged Federal Railroad Administration Administrator Ronald Batory to say when the department will complete an environmental review needed to advance the new Hudson River tunnel, estimated to cost $11.3 billion. — BLOOMBERG NEWS

China’s health crisis as a leadership crisis

Información de publicación: The Christian Science Monitor ; Boston, Mass. [Boston, Mass]. 06 Feb 2020.

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/china-s-health-crisis-as-leadership/docview/2351680830/se-2?accountid=14708

Resumen: Both the Chinese people and their leaders are debating the failings of top-down governance in dealing with the virus outbreak. That alone is a refreshing shift in leadership.

Texto completo: Every year hundreds of books are written about leadership, reflecting not only a rising desire to understand it but also evolving ideas about what it is. Yet there is nothing like watching a country actively debate it. And not just any country.
China, with a fifth of the world’s population, seems to be in serious introspection about its top-down, one-man rule following widespread anger at the government’s response to the coronavirus outbreak. The introspection is even evident at the top.
On Monday, the head of the ruling Communist Party, Xi Jinping, met with other leaders and admitted there had been “shortcomings and deficiencies” in the response. The public health crisis, they said, is “a major test of China’s system and capacity for governance.” They also cited a need for a systematic review of “areas of weakness” in government.
For a party that regards both itself and its vision for Chinese society as infallible, this is a rare expression of humility, a character trait highly recommended in current books on leadership. Yet in another key trait – listening – the party has only stepped up censorship of any online criticism of officials. One prominent intellectual, Xu ­Zhiyong, wrote on social media that Mr. Xi should resign for his “inability to handle major crises.” Another, Xu Zhangrun, a law professor at Tsinghua University in Beijing, wrote that the party’s restriction of freedoms only hindered the people’s ability to raise concerns during the early days of the outbreak. And instead of assigning party members by merit to serve the people, as the party did in the past, the leadership now deems loyalty to the party to be more important. 
“The political system has ­collapsed under the tyranny, and a governance system [made up] of bureaucrats, which has taken [the party] more than 30 years to build has foundered,” he said.
Many Chinese are trying to help their leaders be better leaders. As a prominent novelist, Xu Kaizhen, told The New York Times, “If they can rearrange the order in their hearts, we’ll see a very different governance style.” For China this is a healthy debate, made possible by a health crisis that is truly a test of leadership

Texto completo: A Chinese doctor who was reprimanded by security police for warning fellow doctors about the initial coronavirus outbreak has died of the illness, according to Wuhan Central Hospital.
Li Wenliang, 34, an ophthalmologist at Wuhan Central Hospital, was “unfortunately infected during the fight against the pneumonia epidemic of the new coronavirus infection,” the hospital said on its social media account. “We deeply regret and mourn this. ”
He died early Friday despite an "all-effort rescue" after contracting the virus Jan. 30, according to The People's Daily, the newspaper of China's Communist Party.
The World Health Organization tweeted, “We are deeply saddened by the passing of Dr Li Wenliang. We all need to celebrate work that he did” on the virus.
In a posting on social media, Li alerted fellow doctors Dec. 30 about the emergence of a SARS-like illness, warning them to wear protective clothing to avoid infection, the newspaper said. Wuhan is the epicenter of the coronavirus that has claimed 636 lives among more than 30,877 cases. The fatality rate is 2. 1 percent; that compares to 9. 6 percent for the SARS virus that created similar concern around the globe in 2002.
Four days later, Li was summoned by security police and forced to sign a
letter that accused him of "making false comments" that had "severely disturbed the social order," according to the BBC. Police said he was one of eight people under investigation for "spreading rumors," the BBC reported.
Authorities later apologized to Li, who became a national hero as a whistleblower as the illness spread.
The chief epidemiologist at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention told the editor of the state-owned Global Times that China should praise the eight Wuhan whistleblowers.
"They were wise before the outbreak," though any judgment needs to be backed by scientific evidence, Zeng Guang said.
From his hospital bed, Li broke his police-imposed silence in late January, telling The New York Times in an interview by text message, “If the officials had disclosed information about the epidemic earlier, I think it would have been a lot better. There should be more openness and transparency. ”
Commentary on the social media account of the Supreme People's Court criticized the police for their actions, saying that although the initial reports by Li and others about a possible SARS outbreak were wrong, they were a useful alert that should have been allowed: "If the public listened to this 'rumor' at that time and adopted measures such as wearing a mask, strict disinfection and avoiding going to the wildlife market based on the panic about SARS, this may be a better way for us to prevent and control new pneumonia today.

Texto completo: Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi pulled no punches in a press conference Thursday morning, the day after President Donald Trump was acquitted of all impeachment charges.
When asked how she felt about the president appearing to snub her proffered handshake at the State of the Union, she had a stunning read on the situation.
"It was also an act of kindness, because he looked to me like he was a little sedated," Pelosi said. "He looked that way last year too. But he didn't want to shake hands, that was that. It meant nothing to me."
"That was not a State of the Union," Pelosi added. "That was his state of mind."

Pelosi, who appeared at the National Prayer Breakfast with Trump earlier in the morning, also criticized his demeanor at the bipartisan event, calling it "without class" for the president to bring up Sen. Mitt Romney. Romney was the only Republican who voted "guilty" on one of the impeachment charges Wednesday.

"[It was] so inappropriate at a prayer breakfast," Pelosi said. The New York Times reported during Pelosi's prayer breakfast speech, Trump "seemed to glower and stared straight ahead, not looking at her."
Pelosi also took issue with Trump's questioning of her Catholic faith. In December he tweeted, "She says she 'prays for the President.' I don’t believe her, not even close."
"He really needs our prayers," she said. "So he can say whatever he wants. He can say whatever he wants. But I do pray for him, and I do so sincerely and without anguish."
Early Thursday afternoon, Trump held a press conference, his first since the impeachment acquittal. During his remarks, he said, "Nancy Pelosi is a horrible person... I doubt she prays at all."

Another American Hiring Surge; The NFIB January report says the jobs boom is still going strong.

Texto completo: The great American jobs boom continued at small companies in January, with more hiring and rising wages. That's according to the latest employment survey from the National Federation of Independent Business, due out later today.
NFIB Chief Economist William Dunkelberg shares the good news via email: "Job creation jumped in January, with an average addition of 0.49 workers per firm, the highest level since March 2019, rebounding back into strong territory."
Finding qualified workers remains the biggest business problem for 26% of the small-business owners surveyed. This reading is just one percentage point below the record high set in August.
Proving once again that markets work, proprietors of small firms are rationally responding to a labor shortage by raising pay. According to Mr. Dunkelberg:
Attempting to fill open positions, historically high percentages of owners plan to raise worker compensation. Seasonally adjusted, a net 36 percent reported raising compensation (up 7 points) and a net 24 percent plan to do so in the coming months, unchanged.
Across the economy, companies are trying to hold on to the workers they already have. Looking now at firms of all sizes, firings and layoffs have been hovering around the lowest levels in decades. Jeffry Bartash at MarketWatch reports :
The number of Americans who applied for unemployment benefits at the end of January fell close to a postrecession low, signaling the U.S. labor market is still rock solid despite stiffer economic headwinds...
New unemployment applications are seen as a rough measure of how many people are losing their jobs. They touched a 50-year low of 193,000 in April 2019 and have hovered in the low 200,000s since then.
Still, even though American workers are enjoying an outstanding job market, unfortunately there are bound to be some involuntary separations as particular firms face challenging business conditions. For example, the New York Times reports :
The faulty smartphone app behind the chaotic aftermath of Iowa's Democratic caucuses was the work of a little-known company called Shadow Inc. that was founded by veterans of Hillary Clinton's unsuccessful presidential campaign, and whose previous work was marked by a string of failures, including a near bankruptcy.
The good news for job seekers—including former app developers—is that recession is nowhere in sight. And as the NFIB data show, demand for labor is so strong that the significant constraint on economic growth is a lack of workers.
Can U.S. job creation get any better? Natixis economist Joe Lavorgna says yes. In a note to clients, Mr. Lavorgna previews Friday's employment report from the U.S. Department of Labor:
... investors are expecting a healthy gain in nonfarm payrolls. Inevitably, this will cause some analysts to argue the job market will soon slow because of hiring constraints associated with a tight labor market. This misses a key point related to untapped labor availability: the employment to population ratio and the labor force participation rate are above their cyclical lows and trending higher... there is still potential labor supply that can enter the market...
The employment to population ratio simply divides the number of workers by the total size of the civilian population. The ratio bottomed in late 2011 at 58.3% and has been trending higher ever since. However, at 61.0% in December, the series is still below its previous cyclical peak of 63.3% set in December 2006. The current difference translates into nearly 6 million jobs given the present size of the population. The labor force participation rate has more room for improvement.
... In December, the participation rate was steady at 63.2%, which was the close to a 6-year high. We can see the series is still massively below where it was prior to the 2008-2009 recession. Thus, there is potential for significant improvement going forward.
There's good reason to believe the "blue-collar boom" hailed by President Trump can continue. And regardless of occupation U.S. workers continue to enjoy an outstanding job market.

Democrats' carnival of unintended consequences

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- The progressive party's Iowa caucuses were a hilarious parody of progressive governance -- ambitious, complex, subtle and a carnival of unintended consequences. The party that promises to fine-tune everything, from the production of wealth to the allocation of health care to the administration of education, produced a fittingly absurd climax to what surely was Iowa's final strut as a national distraction.
Like a toddler trailing a security blanket across Iowa, Elizabeth Warren clung to identity politics with a fervor that suggested desperation and defied caricature. Eventual autopsies of her campaign, and perhaps of the Democrats' presidential hopes, should ponder this promise to Iowans: For the purpose of "restoring integrity and competence to government," she will have "at least 50% of Cabinet positions filled by women and nonbinary people," and a "young trans person" will vet her secretary of education candidates. In the Democrats' ideological auction, Warren bested Pete Buttigieg who, in what counts in today's Democratic Party as Solomonic centrism, promised only that half the members of his Cabinet will have two X chromosomes.
Four days before Iowa Democrats stumbled into futility, Bernie Sanders revealed to The New York Times the genesis of his socialism. Never mind the gulags, famines, Venezuelas and other wreckages, socialism is justified because the Dodgers decamped from Brooklyn to Los Angeles after the 1957 season when Sanders was 16. The Times says "perhaps no single event has proved more enduring in Mr. Sanders' consciousness -- more viscerally felt in his signature fury toward the 1%." Well.
In 1955, the Dodgers, with six future Hall of Famers, won the World Series but had an average attendance of just 13,423, barely better than MLB's worst-drawing 2019 team (Miami, 10,016). In 1950, St. Louis, the western-most major-league city, had two teams and Los Angeles had none. In Sanders' cartoonish understanding of reality, his explanation of everything he finds objectionable -- other people's "greed" -- explains the loss of what he still considers his eternal entitlement to the Dodgers being in Brooklyn. Never mind that many of the Dodgers' fans left Brooklyn, as did today's senator from Vermont who, by the way, when playing a like-minded rabbi for a film said that he despises "free agency crap" -- the unionized players' hard-won right to negotiate terms of employment with teams of their choice.
Substituting indignation for information, Sanders' baseball nostalgia is akin to his claim that the average worker "is not making a nickel more" than 45 years ago. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office says that from 1990 to 2016 the average household's inflation-adjusted income after taxes and government transfers increased 46%, and 66% for households in the bottom quintile.
Fortunately, there is something comparatively serious in America's political future. Super Tuesday, aka March 3, will allocate 1,357 delegates, 68% of the total needed to nominate. They will come mostly from (never mind American Samoa and Democrats abroad) 14 states that include five that the nominee will lose in November (Alabama, Tennessee, Arkansas, Oklahoma, Utah), three that he or she will win (California, Massachusetts, Vermont), five competitive ones (Maine, Minnesota, North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado) and one (Texas) that might be competitive if the nominee is neither Warren nor Sanders.
If a few early states must initiate the nomination process, they should be unlike Iowa, which has a population just 14% larger than in 1960, compared with North Carolina (130% larger), Georgia (169%), Texas (203%), Colorado (228%) and Florida (334%). Michael Bloomberg, however, is giving a glimpse of another alternative -- a national primary, or several regional primaries. His spending -- $250 million on television and internet ads in two months; approximately what Anheuser-Busch has spent advertising beer in the same period -- will demonstrate either the steeply declining utility of political dollars or the manageable challenge for ordinary candidates to raise large sums from small donors in a nation that spends $8 billion a year on potato chips.
Meanwhile, like startled pheasants flushed from an Iowa cornfield, the surviving Democratic aspirants have fluttered away. The silliest candidates have disappeared (remember Beto O'Rourke? didn't think so) and Iowa has at least clarified the Democrats' clashing theories: Americans are angry and hankering for more turmoil (Warren, Sanders), or Americans are embarrassed and exhausted by today's politics of obnoxious noise (everyone but Warren and Sanders).
Sanders and Warren find billionaires distasteful, and neither they nor their woker-than-thou supporters will graciously accept a rising Bloomberg, so Iowa was just a sample of the Democrats' coming self-inflicted wounds. Donald Trump's smiles usually look strained, like grimaces out of context, but perhaps not today.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Rep. Adam Schiff, who served as the lead House impeachment manager in the trial of President Donald Trump, said former national security adviser John Bolton declined to sign an affidavit about what he knew after the Senate voted against calling more witnesses.
"After they voted to be the first impeachment trial in history without witnesses, we did approach John Bolton's counsel, asked if Mr. Bolton would be willing to submit an affidavit under oath describing what he observed in terms of the president's Ukraine misconduct, and he refused," Schiff told MSNBC Wednesday night on "The Rachel Maddow Show. "
"For whatever reason, he apparently was willing to testify before the Senate, but apart from that, seems intent on saving it for his book," said Schiff, D-Calif. "He'll have to answer for that. "
Attorney Charles Cooper, who represents Bolton, did not immediately respond to USA TODAY's request for comment on Schiff's claim.
'People should pay': Trump appears poised to slam Democrats in White House speech after impeachment acquittal
Calls for Bolton to testify about what he knew began during the House impeachment inquiry into allegations Trump used military aid to pressure Ukraine into announcing investigations for his personal political benefit.
The pleas for his testimony increased after Fiona Hill, a former National Security Council official, testified that Bolton wanted no part of the Ukraine pressure campaign, which he derided as a "drug deal" cooked up by acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and U. S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland.

But Bolton refused to come before the investigating House committees without a court order and the Democrats leading the investigation declined to subpoena him, claiming a lengthy court battle would delay the impeachment process so long that it would make it pointless.
After the House approved two articles of impeachment against Trump on Dec. 18, Cooper said Trump's former national security adviser was "prepared to testify" in the Senate trial if subpoenaed.
A New York Times report about Bolton's book rocked the proceedings while the trial was under way. Bolton's reported claim that Trump told him he wouldn't release the aid without the investigations, led Democrats, and even a couple Republicans, to argue a fair trial required his testimony.
Despite the uproar, the Senate voted against motions to call additional witnesses.
Following Trump's acquittal, House Democrats are returning to their multiple investigations of the Trump administration, the president and his finances. Some have suggested Bolton should still be subpoenaed despite Trump's acquittal on both articles of impeachment.
After the vote to acquit Trump, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N. Y. , said it was "likely" Bolton would be issued a subpoena.
But Schiff said there had been "absolutely no decision made about whether to subpoena John Bolton or not subpoena John Bolton. "
He said committee leaders would be meeting with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. , to discuss "what next steps we should take. "
On Thursday, Pelosi told reporters House Democrats would "continue to do our oversight" but had "no plans at this time" to subpoena Bolton.
Bolton's book, "The Room Where It Happened: A White House Memoir," is set for publication March 17, according to Amazon. But its fate is uncertain after National Security Council staff at the White House determined it contained classified material.

For health workers, copper key to safety

Texto completo: Keeping hospitals and health workers healthy is key to fighting diseases. With new and more deadly viruses, the job is more challenging.
Although the coronavirus has captured the world's attention, it is important to note the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 80,000 Americans died of flu and flu complications in winter 2017-18 - the highest flu-related death toll in at least four decades.
The coronavirus outbreak is very serious. According to the New York Times, China's Health Commission reported 361 deaths nationwide as of Feb. 2. During the 2002-03 SARS outbreak, 349 people died in mainland China.
The coronavirus is not just a China problem. It is showing up in other countries, prompting the Chinese government to quarantine Wuhan, a city of 11 million people. Foreign airlines and passenger railroads have curtailed service to China, which is the world's largest manufacturing economy and exporter of goods.
There is growing concern about the safety of doctors, nurses and health care workers. That worry is not new, but in Hong Kong, for example, some nurses are now striking, demanding better protection. One promising answer is microbial copper textiles.
In 2014, during the Ebola outbreak, British clinical researcher Rory Donnelly told the Khaleej Times that copper-impregnated clothing is the most viable and immediate answer.
"With staff becoming exposed to the virus through lack of appropriate protective equipment, including masks, gowns and gloves, copper clothing is another form of prevention. Several clinical and laboratory studies have been carried out showing copper ions destroy bacteria and the benefits to humans have recently come to light," Donnelly said.
The coronavirus has sparked new interest in copper clothing - not copper-coated armored suits, but textiles impregnated with copper that kill bacteria and odor on contact and show promising results in rejecting viruses.
"The interest in antimicrobials, especially antiviral coating, is very, very high," A. Blanton Godfrey, dean of the College of Textiles at North Carolina State University, told the Associated Press in 2006. "Whoever gets it right will have a very nice business."
An Israeli company, Cupron, started making copper-laced socks nearly 20 years ago and has expanded into the U.S. Its Richmond, Virginia, operation successfully tested its copper-infused linens and hard surfaces in Virginia and North Carolina hospitals in 2018. Since then, the company has developed a process to incorporate anti-microbial copper formulations into soft materials such as towels, gowns and masks.
In November the American Society of Microbiology released a new study that discovered copper hospital beds in intensive care units had 95% fewer bacteria than conventional beds.
That's important because "hospital-acquired infections sicken approximately 2 million Americans annually, and kill nearly 100,000," according to Dr. Michael G. Schmidt of the University of South Carolina. They are the eighth-leading cause of U.S. deaths.
Copper and its alloys are important tools in fighting diseases and infections. While government officials are correct to worry about ingestion of any heavy metal into the human body, testing shows that microbial copper textiles are safe and, when used in health care, have significant impact on preventing doctors and health care workers from contracting illnesses.
Copper is the only metal that is deadly to viruses and bacterial and fungal infections. The International Journal of Infection Control reports copper is effective in fighting diseases that develop drug-resistant mutations.
Medical experts correctly fear a repeat of the last influenza pandemic that swept our planet in 1918. The Spanish flu killed an estimated 50 million people - 3% of the world's population. One-fifth of the world's population was attacked by the deadly virus.
The bottom line is healthy health workers are key to helping us recover from common illnesses and epidemics. Copper will likely help improve their safety.

Texto completo: Heartland Animal Shelter is selected by The Jackson Galaxy Project (JGP), a Signature Program of GreaterGood.org, to participate in the 2020 class of Cat Pawsitive Pro, a life-saving initiative that introduces advanced, positive-reinforcement-based behavior training and enrichment to shelter cats. Supported by the Petco Foundation, this innovative training program aims to increase feline adoption rates as well as empower shelter staff and volunteers to maintain and improve cat "mojo."
Jackson Galaxy (star of the television show My Cat from Hell on Animal Planet, and founder of JGP) developed Cat Pawsitive Pro with a team of feline behavior experts. Highlights of the program include: * Improving cat "adoptability" and feline social skills, particularly for shy or fearful cats and long-term residents * Enriching day-to-day life for cats in shelters with physical and mental activity * Promoting the human-cat bond * Teaching and empowering animal shelter staff and volunteers Cats who are exposed to the reward-based training methods of Cat Pawsitive Pro gain confidence, experience reduced stress level and build connections with staff, volunteers and potential adopters. The program can help a shy cat learn to feel comfortable coming up to the front of her cage to meet an adopter, a feisty cat learn to play nice, and an outgoing kitty learn to give an endearing "high five" to his visitors to seal an adoption deal.
"As a shelter worker in the early 90s, I found myself frustrated by the lack of resources and know-how afforded to the cats in my care. Unsocialized cats, traumatized cats, adoptable cats whose spirits were dwindling from lack of stimulation - were all being euthanized. Dogs, however, were being saved thanks in part to burgeoning enrichment programs geared towards physical exercise, confidence-building and the bond created with the humans participating in these programs," said Galaxy. "With the help of a dog trainer, I adapted these clicker-based programs to cats - and the results were immediate and, at least in my eyes, profound. My overwhelming desire at the time was to bring the liberating effects of this approach to as many other shelters and rescues as I could, and in just 4 years we have already helped well over 1,200 cats in 174 shelters find their forever homes, with hundreds more receiving enriching training every day."
A JGP feline behavior expert will lead the program for the shelter beginning February 2nd. Throughout the Spring, staff and volunteers from the animal welfare organization will participate in weekly seminars with their expert and will have direct access to the entire training team for specialized consultations about the cats in their care.
Since 2016, more than 1,200 cats have been adopted during Cat Pawsitive semesters, with hundreds of more cats benefitting from being in the program and continuing their training on the road to adoption. To date, a total of 174 animal welfare organizations have participated in Cat Pawsitive programs and conducted over 20,000 training sessions, with over 1,100 staff members and volunteers taking part in the training of thousands of cats.
Galaxy will be sharing highlights of the program on The Jackson Galaxy Project Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram pages.

New York Times Posts Strong Subscription Growth but Sees Further Ad Declines; Revenue rose, driven by increases in subscription revenue and from new TV program 'The Weekly,' licensing revenue from Facebook News

Texto completo: New York Times Co. reported another quarter of strong digital-subscription growth in the fourth quarter but suffered continuing declines in advertising revenue, which the company said would continue in the following quarter.
The publisher reported net income of $68.2 million, or 41 cents a share, for the quarter, up 24% from $55.2 million, or 33 cents a share, in the same period a year earlier. This was partly helped by a lower effective tax rate that drove tax costs down to $7.7 million for the quarter from $23.3 million a year earlier.
Revenue rose 1.1% to $508.4 million, driven by a 4.5% increase in subscription revenue and a 30% rise in other revenue, mostly coming from the Times's new television program, "The Weekly," and licensing revenue from Facebook News.
The Times reported adjusted earnings from continuing operations—which exclude severance costs, nonoperating retirement costs and special items—of 43 cents a share. Analysts polled by FactSet had forecast adjusted earnings of 35 cents a share on revenue of $502 million.
The company announced that it would increase its dividend to 6 cents per share from 5 cents starting in April.
Digital-subscription growth continued with 342,000 additional customers in the quarter. Of those, 232,000 signed up to the paper's core news offering and 110,000 for its lower-cost cooking and crossword apps.
The Times said it ended the quarter with 4.4 million paid digital subscribers—3.4 million for core news and 966,000 for the cooking and crossword apps. Including print subscribers, the Times had 5.3 million paying customers at the end of the quarter.
"We are seeing continued, real acceleration in our digital transformation," Chief Executive Mark Thompson said in a call with analysts. "Last year was another big year for news and that was no doubt part of the explanation."
The company announced earlier this week that it was raising baseline digital subscription prices to $17 a month from $15, as it tries to offset low-cost offers that have dragged down average revenue per user.
Mr. Thompson noted that the company had ended 2019 with $801 million in digital revenue, surpassing its target of $800 million a year early.
Overall advertising revenue fell 11% to $171.3 million. Revenue from digital advertising declined 11% to $92.2 million. The decline was partially offset by growth in podcast advertising, the company said. Print advertising revenue fell 11% to $79.1 million.
The company forecast that both total advertising revenue and digital advertising revenue would fall in the first quarter by about 10% from the year-earlier period, with digital ad revenue falling in the mid-single digits in percentage terms.
Operating costs for the quarter rose just under 1% to $430.4 million, driven by the cost of an expanding newsroom and product-development team—and increased costs related to the paper's new television series, "The Weekly." Those costs were offset by lower costs in print production and distribution, advertising and marketing.
Marketing expenses, which had been rising in recent quarters as part of an effort to boost digital subscriptions, declined to $45.4 million from $48.6 million a year earlier.
Subscription revenue rose to $275.3 million from $263.6 million a year earlier. That was driven by an increase in revenue from digital subscriptions, which rose 16% to $122.1 million.
Mr. Thompson noted that the company had seen similar retention rates for its $1 a week introductory offer customers as for its other customers.
The company forecast mid-single-digit growth in subscription revenue for the first quarter with digital-only subscription revenue rising by the high teens in percentage terms.
Other revenue rose to $61.8 million in the quarter from $47.5 million and was expected to increase by 15% in the next quarter.

Texto completo: More than 100 models have signed a letter to Victoria's Secret CEO John Mehas demanding that the lingerie company increase efforts to "protect the people they profit from. "
The Model Alliance's call to action comes less than a week after a damning report by The New York Times detailed accusations of "misogyny, bullying and harassment" within Victoria's Secret.
The letter demands "meaningful action" from Victoria's Secret and asks that the company joins the Alliance's RESPECT program to help prevent future abuse. The program, according to the letter, is the "only existing accountability program designed by and for models" that requires "employees, agents, vendors, photographers and other contractors to follow a code of conduct that protects everyone’s safety on the job. "
The letter indicates that Victoria's Secret and its parent company L Brands have refused to join the RESPECT program, which the Alliance has called for since December 2018, and requested again "five months ago. "
Victoria's Secret culture: Bella Hadid, other models endured sexual harassment by executives, report says
In a statement to USA TODAY, L Brands spokesperson Tammy Roberts Myers said the company "absolutely" shares a "common goal with Model Alliance to ensure the safety and well-being of models. "
Myers noted the company's photo shoot procedures, which were implemented last May and updated in August and require an independent party present at photo shoots, a third-party hotline and increased screenings and trainings.
"We’re proud of the progress we’ve made and remain committed to continuous improvement," the statement added. "We’re always open to engage with those looking to make improvements in the industry. "
She also directed USA TODAY to a statement from L Brands’ Independent Board of Directors in response to The Times report.
"We can assure you that the company is intensely focused on the corporate governance, workplace, and compliance practices that directly impact our 80,000 associates around the world, nearly 90% of whom are female," the statement read. "With the adoption in recent years of even more robust anti-harassment policies, hotline reporting, and training, we have made significant strides in ensuring that the company provides a safe, welcoming, and empowering workplace for every associate. We regret any instance where we did not achieve this objective and are fully committed to continuous improvement and complete accountability. "
Model Alliance's letter includes signatures from models Iskra Lawrence and Amber Valletta.
The letter ends by saying that the Alliance stands with the "courageous women who have come forward and shared their stories, despite fears of retaliation or harm to their careers. "
On Saturday, The Times uncovered several accusations of inappropriate conduct toward models, including supermodel Bella Hadid.
More: Victoria's Secret Fashion Show officially canceled for 2019
The complaints were made against Ed Razek, who recently stepped down as president and chief marketing officer of Victoria's Secret parent company L Brands. The allegations include bullying, lewd comments and sexual harassment.
Leslie Wexner, founder and chief executive of L Brands, was alerted to Razek's behavior, the report says. But some women who came forward lost their Victoria's Secret modeling jobs as a result.
The report comes amid turmoil for the brand: The annual Victoria's Secret Fashion Show was canceled in November after the company announced in May it was going to "re-think" the show.
In a statement sent to the company's associates at the time and obtained by USA TODAY, Wexner said the show would be going in a different direction.
"Fashion is a business of change. We must evolve and change to grow. With that in mind, we have decided to re-think the traditional Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show," the statement read. "Going forward we don’t believe network television is the right fit. "
The show in recent years had been buffeted by bad publicity, bad reviews and bad numbers. The 2018 show's audience of 3. 27 million viewers was the smallest since it became a holiday season TV event in 2001, with Nielsen saying the show has lost more than half its television audience in two years.
The Times report also includes accusations that Razek made inappropriate comments to supermodel Hadid at a 2018 fashion show fitting. Citing three people present and a fourth who was later told about it, the report said Razek sat on a couch, watching while Hadid was being fitted for underwear to make sure the look would be appropriate for television.
"Forget the panties," he said, according to the report. He also made a lewd comment about Hadid having "perfect" breasts. USA TODAY has reached out to Hadid's representative for comment.
Three people also told The Times that Razek touched another model's crotch through her underwear at the same fitting.
In November, Hadid opened up about lacking confidence while modeling lingerie for Victoria's Secret, a relationship that dissolved after she joined Rihannah's Savage X Fenty lingerie brand.
"Rihanna’s amazing. For me, that was the first time on a runway that I felt really sexy," Hadid said. "When I first did Fenty, I was doing other lingerie shows and I never felt powerful on a runway, like, in underwear. "
The younger sister of supermodel sister Gigi Hadid modeled in Victoria Secret's fashion show three times, most recently in November 2018, where she donned multiple looks.
The difference? "With Rihanna's show, she was like, 'Walk whatever way you want to walk,'" Hadid said.

Texto completo: Q: We've been watching old episodes of "Dog the Bounty Hunter" on Justice Network. Beth, his wife, was so pretty. Let us know about her death. And is Dog ill now?
A: Beth Chapman, the wife of Duane "Dog" Chapman, died in June 2019 after a recurrence of throat cancer. Her final days were chronicled on "Dog's Most Wanted." A profile of Chapman in the New York Times said that after Beth's death, Dog suffered a pulmonary embolism. Since then he has worked at losing weight and cutting back his smoking. "But sunblock and quitting tanning salons aren't happening," the Times said of the man with "beet-red tanned skin." He still has trouble sleeping and eating well and has gout. But the Times reported Chapman has plans for another TV show and wants to write a book about Beth. As for the scandal around his use of a racial slur, he is still apologizing, saying "I was wrong."

Q: I know the actress Bridget Hanley played a role in the TV series "Here Come the Brides" in the late 1960s. I'm wondering what other TV shows she was in.
A: "Here Come the Brides" aired on ABC in 1968-70 and was inspired by the movie "Seven Brides for Seven Brothers." In the series, the operator of a logging camp arranged for 100 women to come to Seattle so the men there would keep working. The cast was noteworthy for a couple of rising stars, David Soul and Bobby Sherman. Hanley played Candy Pruitt, the "straw boss" of the women, according to "The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable Shows."
Before that show, Hanley had been a regular on "The Second Hundred Years," a 1967-68 comedy about a prospector (Monte Markham) who thawed out after being frozen since 1900. She would be back in a series a decade later, co-starring with Barbara Eden in "Harper Valley P.T.A.," a comedy inspired by Jeannie C. Riley's hit song of the same name. She also guest-starred on an abundance of comedies and dramas according to the Internet Movie Database, up to 1996, as well as working in theater.

Q: We have been enjoying the Netflix series "Anne With an E," loosely based on the story "Anne of Green Gables." We read that the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. and Netflix were unable to agree on continuing the series. What information do you have?
A: There's always a chance of a show getting revived these days; the fans of "Anne With an E" are certainly lobbying for its continuation. But the issue here goes beyond one show into one of who will make and profit from shows. Before breaking up with Netflix, the CBC became concerned that working with the international giant was hurting its own operations in Canada: "A number of countries have done deals, as we did, with Netflix," a top executive told the Content Canada podcast, "and over time we start to see that we're feeding the growth of Netflix, or we're feeding the growth of Amazon, rather than feeding our own domestic business and industry."

Q: I enjoyed "Virgin River" so much, but the ending so left you hanging. Will they do another series? I did buy some of the sequel books titled "Virgin River" but I want shows!
A: Netflix has ordered a second season of the show based on the books by Robyn Carr. Look for it later this year.

Aging population finds needs aren't being met There's a rising demand for geriatricians, but few doctors are attracted to specialty

Texto completo: Linda Poskanzer was having a tough time in her late 60s.
"I was not doing well emotionally," she recalled. "Physically, I didn't have any stamina. I was sleeping a lot. I wasn't getting to work."
A therapist in Hackensack, New Jersey, Poskanzer was severely overweight and grew short of breath after walking even short distances. Her house had become disorganized, buried in unsorted paperwork. The antidepressant she was taking didn't seem to help.
Her son, visiting from Florida, called his sisters and said, "Mommy needs an intervention."
One of her daughters made an appointment with a geriatrician - a physician who specializes in the care of older adults. Dr. Manisha Parulekar, now chief of geriatrics at Hackensack University Medical Center, suggested her new patient take action on several fronts. She arranged for a sleep study, which found that Poskanzer suffered from apnea. She prescribed a different antidepressant and physical therapy in a pool to help rebuild her stamina.
And weight loss. Eventually, the geriatrician agreed that bariatric surgery made sense. Over nine months, Poskanzer lost 75 pounds; she has shed another 15 since.
Now about to turn 80, Poskanzer is still receiving therapy, 30 hours each week, feels "full of spirit" and continues to see her geriatrician every four months. "She sits and talks, which a lot of doctors don't do anymore," Poskanzer said. "And she knows me. I feel very well taken care of."
Testimonials like this spotlight the rising need for geriatricians. These doctors not only monitor and coordinate treatment for the many ailments, disabilities and medications their patients contend with, but also help them determine what's most important for their well-being and quality of life.
Patients like Poskanzer often can't easily find geriatricians like Parulekar, however. As the nation's older population surges, the gap between need and supply has steadily widened, and a persistent shortage of geriatricians has troubled the medical profession for years.
Geriatrics became a board-certified medical specialty only in 1988. An analysis published in 2018 showed that over 16 years, through the academic year 2017-18, the number of graduate fellowship programs that train geriatricians, underwritten by Medicare, increased to 210 from 182. That represents virtually no growth when adjusted for the rising U.S. population. "It's basically stagnation," said Aldis Petriceks, the study's lead author, now a medical student at Harvard.
Moreover, geriatrics fails to attract enough young doctors to the graduate fellowships it does offer. Leaving aside geriatric psychiatry, more than a third of 384 slots went unfilled last year, the American Geriatrics Society reports.
If one geriatrician can care for 700 patients with complex medical needs, as a federal model estimates, the nation will need 33,200 such doctors in 2025. It has about 7,000, only half of them practicing full time.
Why do so few residents choose to specialize in geriatrics? Though salaries are rising, total compensation (wages along with certain benefits) for geriatricians in 2018 averaged $233,564, according to the Medical Group Management Association. Anesthesiologists earned twice as much; radiologists and cardiologists topped $500,000.
"These are smart people looking at economic reality," said Dr. Mark Supiano, a geriatrician and researcher at VA Salt Lake City Health Care System. Treating patients covered by Medicare, which pays less than commercial insurance, is a slow way to repay medical school loans.
Nor does the field offer much glamour or the prospect of medical heroics. "Having patience, having good communication skills, it's a different personality than being a surgeon," Supiano acknowledged. Yet a much-cited 2009 survey of 42 medical specialties found that geriatricians reported higher career satisfaction than most.
Not every older person needs a geriatrician, but the federal model estimates that 30% of the over-65 population does. This is especially true "when someone has three or more chronic conditions and is over 85," said Nancy Lundebjerg, chief executive of the American Geriatrics Society.
That describes Dorothy Lakin, 93, whose recent medical history includes heart failure, macular degeneration, falls, colon cancer and heart valve surgeries, and a stroke.
"She's had a zillion trips to the ER, one after another," said her daughter Mary Ellen Lakin, 70, who lives in Newton, Massachusetts. "I thought, 'Let's see if there's a way to make her life easier.' "
Mary Ellen Lakin found her way to Dr. Laura Nelson Frain, a geriatrician at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, who has gently steered mother and daughter through the past year. She reduced the number of medications Dorothy Lakin took and the specialists she saw, stayed in touch with Mary Ellen and sent a geriatric nurse-practitioner to make house calls.
"It's less of 'Let's order this med, let's order that procedure,' more of a holistic approach," Mary Ellen Lakin said. Her mother recently entered hospice care.
Still, given the numbers, "we're not going to address this growing older population through some miraculous influx of specialized geriatricians," Petriceks said.
Leaders in geriatrics agree, and while they continue working to bolster their numbers, they're also adopting other strategies. Dr. Mary Tinetti, chief of geriatrics at the Yale School of Medicine, has called for geriatricians to serve as "a small, elite workforce" who help train whole institutions in the specifics of care for older adults.
"The most important thing geriatricians can do is make sure all their other colleagues" understand these patients' needs, she said, including nurse-practitioners, physician assistants and pharmacists.

Impeachment vote shows Sinema isn't so independent

Información de publicación: Arizona Republic ; Phoenix, Ariz. [Phoenix, Ariz]. 06 Feb 2020: A.1.

Texto completo: In 2018, then-U.S. Senate candidate Kyrsten Sinema was portrayed by the media and her campaign as an "independent voice" for Arizona. Through carefully cultivated TV ads, superficial mailers, and occasionally in her own words, Sinema intended to make crystal clear to voters that the term "Democrat" barely existed in her vernacular.
The question is, was this version of Sinema reality or make-believe?
Sinema promised she would be a different kind of politician; one who would reject her Party in the name of principle. In an October 2018 interview with KTAR, when asked if she was a "proud Democrat," Sinema responded, "Gosh, it's hard to say proud." She echoed as much on the campaign trail, speaking often about her desire to work across the aisle and lead bipartisan efforts to secure a better future for our state.
As Arizonans enjoy the benefits of a president who is keeping his promises, it's easy to see how this confidence could have translated into a belief that Sinema might also do the same. Or maybe Arizona voters believed the "Blue Dog" Democrat brand that Sinema was selling was for real.
Either way, it's clear that this "independent" caricature of Sinema is nothing more than an elaborate facade.
By voting to convict, Sinema caved to the Democrats' false impeachment narrative and proved that Sen. Chuck Schumer's convincing was enough to outweigh her conviction (if she had any in the first place).
In Sinema, Arizonans elected someone who they thought would listen, be objective, and serve independent of political parties and special interests. Instead, we were dealt another radical Democrat in sheep's clothing.
If she cared at all about being an independent voice in the Senate, Sinema would have rejected her party's impeachment sham. If Sinema truly represented independent voices in Arizona, voting to convict the president would've been out of the question. In poll after poll after poll, Arizonans made abundantly clear that they opposed impeachment and want to see Congress get back to work.
The results of an October 2019 New York Times-Siena College Poll found between 51% and 53% opposed impeachment in the battleground states of Arizona, Florida, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.
Another poll of Arizona voters conducted one month later bore out similar results, showing independents disapproved of impeachment by 7-plus points. Again, in the most recent state poll, 52% of Arizonans opposed impeachment of President Trump from office while only 43% supported.
Sinema loves to constantly criticize party politics and toxicity in Washington. It certainly makes for a good sound-bite,
And yet, from the beginning, the Democrats' impeachment charade has been completely partisan. Democrats are on record voicing their desire to impeach President Trump since before he was even sworn into office. With her latest vote, Sinema has proven she's the rule, not the exception.
In her victory speech in 2018, Sinema urged unity over division, saying, "We must be willing to put down our sticks sharpened for battle." No doubt a refreshing sentiment.
But when it came time to vote on impeachment, she couldn't help herself. In the end, Sinema betrayed the trust of Arizonans and put party politics above unifying the country.

Texto completo: Sen. Martha McSally has tucked herself under the wing of President Donald Trump, and Arizona voters need to ask themselves if the reason, simply, is fear.
It's not just a question for McSally, of course. It's a question that should be asked – needs to be asked – of every Republican in Congress: How terrified are you of Donald Trump?
Because they are.
Back in 2016, during the presidential campaign, Trump told Bob Woodward and Robert Costa of The Washington Post that, "Real power is – I don't even want to use the word – fear."
Woodward later called it "an almost Shakespearean moment," illustrating "that great ambivalence of the politician speaking a dangerous truth."
We'd like to believe that the individuals we send to Washington do their best to represent our interests. But we know in our heart of hearts that the priority for many (if not most) of them is simply keeping their jobs.
Trump knows this, and uses it to keep Republicans in line.
The New York Times put it this way in a recent article:
Interviews with current and former Republican lawmakers as well as party strategists, many of whom requested anonymity so as not to publicly cross the president, suggest that many elected officials are effectively faced with two choices. They can vote with their feet by retiring ... or they can mute their criticism of him. All the incentives that shape political behavior – with voters, donors and the news media – compel Republicans to bow to Mr. Trump if they want to survive.
We saw evidence of it here when Sen. Jeff Flake retired rather than bow to Trump.
McSally, on the other hand, genuflects.
A large number of Republicans who criticized Trump during his campaign have meekly acquiesced. As Trump knew they would. During that same interview with Woodward and Costa in 2016, Trump was asked if he could mend fences with his primary rivals, whom he'd derided. He wasn't worried about that.
He figured they would surrender.
He said: "Don't forget, I've been hit hard. I went in one of 17 and they hit me harder than anybody. And I hit back very hard. Harder than they hit me. Jeb: low energy. Little Marco. Names that were devastating ... I hit back very hard. I am telling you, almost all of these people that you would never think would ever — will want to come on board."
And they did. Marco Rubio. Ted Cruz. Rand Paul. (Who called Trump an "orange-faced windbag.") Lindsey Graham. (Who said, "If we nominate Trump, we will get destroyed ... and we will deserve it.") So many others who were critical of Trump during the campaign now bow to him.
Already there are reports of Trump's plans to go after his perceived enemies with the impeachment is over. (Watch out John Bolton, and Democrats such as Reps. Jerry Nadler and Adam Schiff, and Republican Sen. Mitt Romney, who did not kowtow.)
In his book "The Art of the Comeback," Trump talked about seeking revenge against those he believes to have wronged him.
He wrote, "I believe in an eye for an eye ... I'm screwing them against the wall ... And I'm having so much fun ... If you do not get even, you are just a schmuck!"
He said once in a speech, and has repeated many times, "When somebody screws you, screw them back in spades ... Go for the jugular so that people watching will not want to mess with you."
This aspect of Trump is well known to McSally and Arizona's Republican members in the House, all of whom dip, curtsy and cower before the president. They probably would tell you it is out of political and philosophical agreement.
Or conviction.
Or loyalty.
Or respect.
Anything but the real reason ... fear.

Texto completo: DETROIT -- Phoenix talked about wanting to end this three-game road trip with a win after consecutive losses by 20-plus points at Milwaukee and at Brooklyn.
Detroit had other ideas.
Andre Drummond posted a massive double-double (31 points, 19 rebounds) in powering the Pistons past the Suns, 116-108, at Little Caesars Arena.
Reggie Jackson added 25 as Detroit (19-34) attempted 18 more shots than Phoenix (20-31) and scored 66 points in the paint.
Kelly Oubre Jr. led Phoenix with 39 as the Suns are reportedly in the middle of trade talks for the talented wing playergoing into Thursday's trade deadline. New York Times' NBA insider Mark Stein tweeted Phoenix was "fielding calls" for Oubre, who is having a career year.
A source close to the situation has informed The Republic that Oubre isn't on the trading block, but a lot can happen between now and the trade deadline at 1 p.m. Phoenix time.
"Just got to go out there and do my job," Oubre said. "Just play basketball. I just ask that I don't get (the news where) somebody tells me while I'm on the bench or something. You know how that goes or I'm in the locker room with my guys. There's nothing you can do about it. We're players in this game and at the end of the day, I can just play and control what I can control. The higher ups are going to do what they do to help organizations get better and you just got to deal with what comes with it."
The Suns have also been in talks with Detroit with a trade centered around Luke Kennard and Phoenix's first-round pick. The pick seems, as I wrote earlier this afternoon, to be holding it up for now.
Jevon Carter and Elie Okobo were part of the trade talk as well.
"Man, I just go hoop," Carter said. "Wherever they call me to play, that's where I'll go."
The Suns are still not healthy as Tyler Johnson (knee), Ty Jerome (calf), Dario Saric (ankle), Aron Baynes (hip), Cam Johnson (quad) and Frank Kaminsky (patella stress fracture) sat Wednesday night.
Then again, Detroit was without Blake Griffin (left knee surgery), Derrick Rose (hip), Luke Kennard (knee tendinitis), Markieff Morris (illness), Svi Mykhailiuk (hip) and Khyri Thomas (foot surgery).
Deandre Ayton added 26 points with 11 points in the first quarter and 12 rebounds while Devin Booker chipped in 22 points and seven assists.
Key moments Fourth quarter: Oubre gave Phoenix an 94-93 advantage on a 3, but Detroit once again answered with a 17-8 run to take a 110-102 lead with 3:41 left.
The Pistons capped that run with a 7-0 spurt as Reggie Jackson hit his fifth 3 of the night, forcing Monty Williams to call a timeout with 3:40 left
Third quarter: Detroit took an 89-86 lead going into the fourth after Phoenix took a 74-71 lead on a Booker 3 midway through the quarter
Langston Galloway answered with a 3 tie the game and start a 9-0 spurt to put Detroit ahead, 80-74, with four minutes left in the third.
First half: Suns trailed 64-61 despite shooting 61.5% from the field. The Pistons lead by as many as 12 in the first half as they took 13 more shots from the field.
Drummond posted 20 points and 11 rebounds as part of Detroit's dominant 36 points in the paint.
Phoenix went on a 12-0 run to tie the game at 48-48 with 4:51 left in the half as Oubre scored the first seven points of the run, but fell back behind by as much as seven.
Drummond scored the final four points of an 8-1 spurt that put Detroit back up, 56-49, with 2:32 left in the half.
What we learned about the Suns tonight? Both teams were walking wounded. Detroit and Phoenix both had six players out, but clearly the Suns need their players back more than the Pistons.
The Suns not only are missing quality depth, but they're putting lineups out there with players who haven't played much together.
This seems to be impacting Ricky Rubio's offense and defense. He's giving the Suns the assists. Had double figures in that department, but he's not putting pressure on the rim, isn't hitting the 3 and has been a liability on the defensive end.
As good as Ayton's offense was, his defense was equally as bad, particularly on either his coverage of Drummond 1-on-1 or in space. He can score, but his man can't do the same or the two just offset each other.
By the numbers
12 Total players (6 Suns, 6 Pistons) who missed the game with injuries
61.5 The Suns trailed 64-61 despite shooting 61.5% from the field.
The Suns' Kelly Oubre Jr. is fouled by the Pistons' Tony Snell in the second half at Little Caesars Arena in Detroit on Wednesday night.

Jigsaw unveils tool to help journalists spot fake images

Texto completo: A doctored, phony image of President Barack Obama shaking hands with President Hassan Rouhani of Iran. A real photograph of a Muslim girl at a desk doing her homework with President Donald Trump looming in the background on television.
It is not always easy to tell the difference between real and fake photographs.
But the pressure to get it right has never been more urgent as the amount of false political content online continues to rise.
This week, Jigsaw, a company that develops cutting-edge tech and is owned by Google's parent, unveiled a free tool that researchers said could help journalists spot doctored photographs -- even ones created with the help of artificial intelligence.
Jigsaw, known as Google Ideas when it was founded, said it was testing the tool, called Assembler, with more than a dozen news and fact-checking organizations around the world. They include Animal Politico in Mexico, Rappler in the Philippines and Agence France-Presse. It does not plan to offer the tool to the public.
"We observed an evolution in how disinformation was being used to manipulate elections, wage war and disrupt civil society," Jared Cohen, Jigsaw's chief executive, wrote in a blog post about Assembler. "But as the tactics of disinformation were evolving, so too were the technologies used to detect and ultimately stop disinformation."
The tool is meant to verify the authenticity of images -- or show where they may have been altered.
Reporters can feed images into Assembler, which has seven "detectors," each one built to spot a specific type of photo-manipulation technique.
When an image has been manipulated -- for instance, two images were merged together or something was deleted from the background -- traces of the changes may be left behind.
With a computer program that has been trained to learn from being shown example after example of what it should detect, Assembler can analyze an image and highlight where it thinks those traces are.
Five of the Assembler's image detectors were developed by research teams at universities, including the University of California, Berkeley; the University of Naples Federico II in Italy; and the University of Maryland. The models can detect things like color pattern anomalies, areas of an image that have been copied and pasted several times over and whether more than one camera model was used to create an image.
"These detectors cannot completely solve the problem, but they represent an important tool to fight disinformation," said Luisa Verdoliva, a professor at the Naples university and a visiting scholar at Google AI.
The other two detectors were developed by Jigsaw. One was designed to identify "deepfakes," realistic images that have been heavily manipulated by artificial intelligence in ways meant to mislead an audience.
Santiago Andrigo, a Jigsaw product manager, said Assembler might be "most helpful in a situation where a journalist from a large news organization receives a scandalous image and is under pressure to break the news."
It could also be used to verify an image that has gone viral, he said.
Jigsaw also announced an interactive platform showing coordinated disinformation campaigns from around the world over the past decade.
They include Ukrainian soldiers receiving targeted disinformation encouraging them to defect during the 2014 Russian annexation of Crimea; associates of President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines hiring "click armies" to write pro-Duterte comments and stories online; and a small-town California hospital hiring a private firm, Psy-Group, to influence public opinion about a contested seat on the hospital board.
The database described the players involved in influence operations, common tactics used and how the falsehoods were spread on social media platforms.
Jigsaw worked with the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab to organize the set of around 60 disinformation cases, culled from over 700 investigations, articles and reports the lab published over the last five years.

Texto completo: Want to catch something on the big screen this weekend? Here's what's in theaters from blockbusters to independent films.
Ratings key: **** excellent; *** good; ** fair; * poor.
"Bad Boys For Life" **
R, 2:04, action-comedy
A lot goes on in between the natural life cycle of a two-movie phenomenon from another time, and an attempt to tack on a third and get it going again. This film is that attempt. Aside from the bit about Martin Lawrence being able to beat Will Smith in a foot race, the movie has very few unintentional laughs. It boasts a handful of cheap intentional ones, lots and lots of automatic gunfire and bleeding, and a nutty pileup of influences, from late-period "Fast & Furious" to "Mission: Impossible" to "21 Jump Street." It may be a frantic visual blur, but it's razor-sharp thematically. Its mission, should you choose to accept it, is to make a jaded 2020 audience glad to see these guys again. The movie's not the point. The boys are the point. -- Michael Phillips, Chicago Tribune
"A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood" ***
PG, 1:48, drama
This film is not primarily about Fred Rogers, or "Mister Rogers' Neighborhood," and it isn't a traditional biopic. You should know these things going into this eccentric, often moving ruminative mixed bag – which is worth seeing -- and debating. It focuses on the moral character development of cynical magazine writer Lloyd Vogel (Matthew Rhys), assigned by Esquire magazine to interview his temperamental polar opposite, the famously gentle, reassuring and resoundingly kind public TV children's show host. With subtle but clearly well-researched care, Tom Hanks makes Rogers his own, neither sending him up or saint-ing it up. The new movie has the unavoidable misfortune of following in the footsteps of last year's documentary "Won't You Be My Neighbor?" -- a gratifying crossover commercial success. This one is the odder, riskier and potentially bait-and-switch-ier of the two. But Hanks keeps the trolley on the rails, and everything comes together in a remarkable final shot. -- Michael Phillips, Chicago Tribune
"Bombshell" ** 1/2
R, 1:48, drama
Like "Richard Jewell," this film dramatizes a radioactive chunk of the very recent past. It's set in 2015-16, taking us behind the slick, panicky façade of Fox News. Trump's presidential bid looms large in the background. CEO Roger Ailes, former Republican political operative, reigns as king of the hill, surrounded by his hand-picked cadre of trim, blonde, loyal on-air talent. That loyalty came at a price: sexual harassment. The cast is strong and wily enough to paper over every flaw, overstatement and simplification in this story based on true events. Charlize Theron captures the demeanor, vocal timbre and unblinking intensity of Megyn Kelly like a boss. Nicole Kidman's Gretchen Carlson is more of a stealth performance, clean and effective in her technique, dropping the mask, memorably, when no one's around to see her rage. As Kayla (a fictional character), Margot Robbie enjoys the freedom of playing the film's liveliest character -- and she has a very fine scene partner in Kate McKinnon. -- Michael Phillips, Chicago Tribune
"Chinese Portrait" ** 1/2
No MPAA rating, 1:19, documentary
In its title and its panoramic scope, "Chinese Portrait" promises a snapshot of modern China, with scenes that show life in settings urban and rural, industrial and agrarian, scenic and seedy. This documentary's human subjects are young and old. But in intriguing, sometimes unsatisfying ways, it leaves the synthesis to the viewer. It is an experimental film more than it is a state-of-the-nation address. Many scenes consist of a single shot, and the vignettes are generally separated by brief bits of visible film leader. The pieces of dialogue that can be heard go unsubtitled. And while the film depicts a diverse cross-section of Chinese life -- from horses grazing in the countryside to a man in a respiratory mask in a smoggy cityscape; from Muslims in prayer to a dimly lit celebration -- its primary interest lies in the tension between candid moments and shots that appear artfully composed. -- Ben Kenigsberg, The New York Times
"Color Out of Space" ** 1/2
No MPAA rating, 1:50, horror
Richard Stanley's first big-screen narrative feature since 1992 is based on a much-adapted H.P. Lovecraft story, and like most prior versions, takes considerable liberties with the original material. Entertaining but uneven, the result is a deliberately over-the-top sci-fi horror exercise that loses some focus as the action grows more psychedelically unhinged -- its oscillating tone not necessarily helped by Nicolas Cage growing likewise, in one of his less inspired gonzo-style performances. -- Dennis Harvey, Variety
"Created Equal: Clarence Thomas in His Own Words" *
PG-13, 1:56, documentary
The most obvious selling point here also happens to be its most conspicuous deficiency. Justice Clarence Thomas has distinguished himself with his silence on the Supreme Court; in 2016, he asked his first question from the bench in a decade. (Three years later, he asked another.) Speaking directly to the camera in "Created Equal," Thomas is veritably chatty, reminiscing about his childhood, extolling the work of Ayn Rand, smiling wryly at his own quips. The producers spent more than 30 hours interviewing Thomas and his wife, Virginia. Simply getting to watch Thomas expound on his thoughts for an extended length of time constitutes its own kind of novelty -- a surprise that begins to wear off when it becomes clear that Thomas will mostly be rehashing the life story he already recounted in his 2007 memoir. The only talking heads are Thomas' and Virginia's; no other perspectives are offered. -- Jennifer Szalai, The New York Times
"Dolittle" * 1/2
PG, 1:46, family
In what feels like a corporate panic, co-writer and director Stephen Gaghan's franchise hopeful trades charm for noise, and wit for a climactic dragon colonoscopy. This film, like its predecessors, owes its inspiration to Hugh Lofting, whose fanciful letters home during World War I formed the genesis of the first Dolittle book published in 1920, about a doctor who can "talk" to animals. In the title role, Robert Downey Jr. favors a blase, throw-it-away delivery and demeanor that can easily lapse into a form of subtle heckling. The problems begin and end with the script, which turns its title character into an eccentric and wearying blur of tics, tacked onto a character who comports himself like a bullying, egocentric A-lister rather than someone who, you know, actually enjoys the company of animals. The banter enjoys the benefit of genuine comic pros doing the voices of the animals, but the zingers remain low on zing, bordering on total zinglessness. So where's the ... oh, what's the word ... fun? -- Michael Phillips, Chicago Tribune
"Ford v Ferrari" ***
PG-13, 2:32, action-drama
This film works as a stylish, enjoyable mash note to its era and the need for speed. Matt Damon plays Texas race car designer Carroll Shelby, hired by the Ford Motor Company to dream up and execute a competitive vehicle. Mission, should car and driver choose to accept it: to win the grueling marathon known as 24 Hours of Le Mans. In the time span laid out by screenwriters, the previous six Le Mans endurance feats, 1960-1966, have been won by Ferrari. Christian Bale co-stars with Damon, portraying the English racer, engineer and mechanic Ken Miles. Emotionally the story belongs to Miles, not Shelby, and Bale brings an outsize energy to the proceedings. Irish actress Caitriona Balfe plays Mollie, Miles' wife and rock and not-fully characterized conscience. Tracy Letts essentially steals the movie as Henry Ford II, who has a spectacularly funny and then unexpectedly moving meltdown during and after a GT40 test drive at extremely high speed. -- Michael Phillips, Chicago Tribune
"Frozen 2" ***
PG, 1:43, animation
This sequel pulls Elsa the Snow Queen (voiced by Idina Menzel) and her less magical but nonetheless charismatic younger sister, Anna (Kristen Bell), into a murky web of Shakespearean political intrigue, with a large dose of Scandinavian pagan mythology; late-'80s/early-'90s-style power ballads from songwriters Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez; and just enough Olaf (snowman) and Sven (reindeer) to please younger viewers who, for years, after the first "Frozen" conquered the world in 2013, went to bed and then woke up signing "Let It Go."-- Michael Phillips, Chicago Tribune
"The Gentlemen" ** 1/2
R, 1:53, action
Director Guy Ritchie expands his horizons to England's upper crust (the "toffs," if you will). The lords and ladies are a means to an end for the protagonist, Mickey Pearson (Matthew McConaughey), an American Rhodes scholar-turned-weed dealer who has worked out a deal with the landed gentry. They have the land he needs for his grow operation; he has the money they need to sustain their titled lifestyles. Now Mickey wants to get out of the game, and he's trying to sell his organization to the highest bidder. Will it be the fey Jewish billionaire Matthew Berger (Jeremy Strong), or the aggressive young Chinese upstart Dry Eye (Henry Golding)? It's not just the tale of a simple sale, though. It's recounted by an opportunistic private eye, Fletcher (Hugh Grant), who has turned up on the doorstep of Mickey's right hand man, Ray (Charlie Hunnam). It can be easy to be swept away by all the beautiful people, classic rock needle drops, wild costumes and regional accents. But kick the tires and you'll start to realize the story's a lemon. It's fairly simple underneath the layers of unreliable narrators and unnecessarily extraneous plot twists, which end up having all the intrigue of a potato. -- Katie Walsh, Tribune News Service
"Gretel & Hansel" **
PG-13, 1:27, horror
In director Osgood Perkins' gorgeous third horror film, flipping the names in the traditional title to "Gretel & Hansel" is no coincidence, and there's little question of who is deserving of more prominence. The older sister Gretel (Sophia Lillis) isn't just given the larger role of the two siblings; instead, this retelling of the fairy tale elevates the concept of female power to one of its primary themes, illuminating the abilities of not only the witch but also a girl on the cusp of womanhood. Those who know the classic by heart will find a few surprises here; unfortunately, its themes are muddled. While the film offers a stunning feast for the eyes, the substance is likely to leave viewers still hungry. -- Kimber Myers, Los Angeles Times
"The Grudge" ** 1/2
R, 1:33, horror
Writer-director Nicolas Pesce's new American version of "The Grudge" doesn't reinvent the formula. Andrea Riseborough plays Detective Muldoon, a newly widowed cop investigating the violent history of a house in the small town she's recently moved to with her young son. As she discovers the house is cursed, Muldoon begins experiencing the effects of that curse herself. Muldoon's investigation leads to stories within stories -- all about hauntings and murders -- which Pesce weaves together with the help of an impressive cast that includes John Cho, Betty Gilpin, Lin Shaye, Jackie Weaver, and Frankie Faison. But fans of Pesce's idiosyncratic indie horror films "The Eyes of My Mother" and "Piercing" may be disappointed by how he toes the line here. His "Grudge" is truer to the original franchise than it is to his own more disturbing visions. -- Noel Murray, Tribune News Service
"The Irishman" *** 1/2
R, 3:30, drama
The story of Teamsters lifer and murder-for-hire hitman Frank Sheeran rests on a 1975 road trip two couples, the Sheerans and the Bufalinos of the Bufalino Pennsylvania crime family, once took together, driving west to Detroit for a politically obligatory wedding, with some business to be conducted along the way. The movie is about that business, and how it haunts a man to the end of his days. Martin Scorsese's latest film clocks in at three and a half hours. But many years have passed since a Scorsese movie found so much life in such small moments: at a bowling alley, around a dinner table, at a telephone in the room next to the dining room, where a killer stumbles through a sympathy call to the wife of Jimmy Hoffa, missing presumed dead. Robert De Niro as Sheeran does some of his cleanest, most affecting work in a long time here, and working with Joe Pesci again, particularly, has brought out a new instinct for minimalism in what must feel, for De Niro, like mighty familiar territory. -- Michael Phillips, Chicago Tribune
"Jojo Rabbit" **
PG-13, 1:48, comedy
Young Jojo, short for Johannes, is an eager Hitler Youth participant who sets off excitedly for a training weekend led by the eccentric one-eyed Captain K (Sam Rockwell) and his assistants (Alfie Allen and Rebel Wilson). Despite his enthusiasm and motivational affirmations supplied by his fantastical chats with Der Fuhrer, Jojo learns the hard way about the cruelty of older kids, earning the titular nickname when he's unable to kill a bunny. In director Taika Waititi's film, billed as an "anti-hate satire," Waititi himself plays Adolf Hitler. But that seems to be both the beginning and the end of the joke. This Hitler is an imaginary friend to Jojo (Roman Griffin Davis), and Waititi's silly, irreverent performance declaws the towering 20th century figure of hate. However, in doing so, he declaws his own satire, too. "Jojo Rabbit" has plenty of bark, but no bite to back it up. It's not quite a satire because it's trying hard to be heartwarming at the same time, all against the backdrop of the waning days of World War II. -- Katie Walsh, Tribune News Service
"Joker" * 1/2
R, 2:02, drama
As Arthur Fleck, a perpetually humiliated, bullied and marginalized Gotham City clown for hire dreaming of a career in stand-up comedy, Joaquin Phoenix regards himself in a makeup mirror until a tear rolls down his whiteface cheek: "I haven't been happy one minute of my entire f-----g life." The movie, directed by and co-written by Todd Phillips, honors his pain by being one. For a while "Joker" (an origin story for the "Batman" villain) gets by on sheer morbidity, saving its most explicit bursts of violence for the final third. The first big kill sets up the rules for the rest of the movie: On a train, Arthur is bullied and beaten by three "Wall Street guys" who work for Wayne Investments. Arthur's revenge takes a page from the Bernhard Goetz subway shooter playbook. Except for one murder committed off-screen in the epilogue, everybody this proto-Joker kills has it coming. His killings are emotionally and even morally justified in the filmmaker's eyes. You'd be an idiot to bring kids to this. -- Michael Phillips, Chicago Tribune
"Jumanji: The Next Level" ** 1/2
PG, 2:03, family
Director Jake Kasdan's 2017 film "Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle" took the mysterious board game introduced in Chris Van Allsburg's splendid picture book and upgraded it into a Nintendo-style console entertainment. Said game then proceeded to suck four teenagers into its virtual safari-themed world, recasting them as fantasy avatars played, in nimbly elastic comic performances, by Dwayne Johnson, Kevin Hart, Jack Black and Karen Gillan. It was a body-swap comedy at heart, a movie of gratifyingly analog pleasures beneath the obligatory CGI razzle-dazzle. Kasdan's sequel is an amiable retread passing itself off as an upgrade. It reunites the original cast and adds some welcome new faces, a couple of fresh conceptual wrinkles, two hair-raising action scenes and some unearned lump-in-the-throat sentimentality. It's not bad for an hour's entertainment; too bad it runs for two. -- Justin Chang, Los Angeles Times
"Just Mercy" ** 1/2
PG-13, 2:16, drama
The movie comes from a 2014 memoir by civil rights activist Bryan Stevenson, a passionate advocate for Death Row inmates. The Harvard-educated Stevenson, played by Michael B. Jordan, takes a case in Monroeville, Alabama: Walter McMillian (Jamie Foxx), an African-American business owner is sentenced to death for killing an 18-year-old white woman. Soon enough, Stevenson realizes how faulty and selective the evidence against McMillian really was. The activist gradually convinces the prisoner's family, and then McMillian himself, that he has a shot at redemption. This film is solid, meat-and-potatoes docudrama filmmaking, if you don't mind a first-rate story of systemic injustice undercut by second-rate dialogue. What's missing is a sense of human complication within an inhuman judicial sphere. While Foxx works wonders, especially in his scenes with Jordan, "Just Mercy" rarely gets under the skin or behind the eyes of McMillian. -- Michael Phillips, Chicago Tribune
"Knives Out" *** 1/2
PG-13, 2:10, mystery
Writer-director Rian Johnson's fizzy Agatha Christie riff succeeds as a throwback with more than mere nostalgia on its mind. The film begins with the corpse of famously reclusive mystery novelist Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer), and backs up to the night of his 85th birthday party. The extended family has its left and right flanks, politically, and the knives are out, metaphorically, early and often. The cast, including Toni Collette and Jamie Lee Curtis, could sell "Knives Out" even if it were "Spoons Out," or "Sporks Out." Michael Shannon plays Walt, who runs dad's publishing empire with an ambiguous set of business skills. Don Johnson plays the MAGA-loving conservative married to Linda. These and others make up the Thrombey socio-economic bubble. And the drawling Southern detective on the prowl -- who goes by the color-coded name Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig) -- is the rock-solid center this confection needs. -- Michael Phillips, Chicago Tribune
"The Last Full Measure" ** 1/2
R, 1:50, drama
Todd Robinson's film depicts the long quest to award Air Force medic William Pitsenbarger the Medal of Honor 34 years after he perished in the Vietnam War. It's so important to his surviving Air Force buddies and the Army soldiers he rescued that Pitsenbarger receive the medal that they spend three decades in pursuit of the distinction. By 1999, they eventually get the file on the desk of D.C. bureaucrat Scott Huffman (Sebastian Stan), who is saddled with the task of pushing through the request before Pitsenbarger's father (Christopher Plummer) dies. What at first seems like an onerous task to the ambitious Scott soon becomes a cathartic emotional exploration and bonding experience for the veterans who remain prisoners to their own painful memories of war. What one walks away with from isn't necessarily the heroism of Pitsenbarger, though his personal sacrifice was immense. What the film reveals is the deep shame and trauma vets contend with, as survivors who made it out alive, as men who are fallible and flawed who did their best under extreme violence and duress and have to live with those choices for the rest of their lives. -- Katie Walsh, Tribune News Service
"Les Miserables" ***
R, 1:44, drama
French director Ladj Ly's choice of film title is a brash, audacious one, but its invocation of Victor Hugo's 1862 opus is no empty gesture. As a statement of new-generation intent, symbolically reclaiming a national-treasure text to reflect the more diverse reality of contemporary France, it makes its point. The screenplay, takes a rookie's-first-day structure familiar from "Training Day and countless others of its ilk, introducing a mediating conscience of sorts in the form of Stephane (Damien Bonnard), a level-headed, by-the-book policeman newly transferred to Les Bosquets from a less fraught precinct. Occasionally recalling the more urgent, ragged work of Spike Lee its feverish, on-the-ground formal energy, "Les Miserables" is aptly galling as a study of everyday power structures tested and exploited to breaking point; its best scenes are combative in the discomfort they raise, prodding viewers to ask if, when and how they would intervene in various ugly displays of unchecked authority. -- Guy Lodge, Variety
"Like a Boss" * 1/2
R, 1:23, comedy
Besties since middle school and housemates for years, Mia (Tiffany Haddish) and Mel (Rose Byrne) run an Atlanta beauty boutique, staffed by makeup wizard Barrett (Billy Porter) and their colleague Sydney (Jennifer Coolidge). The salon is half-a-million in debt, and a lifeline appears with cosmetics conglomerate honcho and conniving shark Claire Luna (Salma Hayek). Somewhere between the screenwriters' pitch and the film's release, this movie sprang a leak and dribbled away all its comic possibilities. It's frankly depressing to watch Haddish and her able co-stars bang their heads against a story calculated to celebrate sisterhood but playing into every possible stereotype. Mainly what "Like a Boss" sells is raunch, with much foundation, and certainly no concealer. It's a mechanical series of witless yeast infection jokes, or thereabouts. -- Michael Phillips, Chicago Tribune
"Little Women" ****
PG, 2:15, drama
Writer-director Greta Gerwig's screen version of Louisa May Alcott's novel begins with a title card featuring Alcott's own words: "I had lots of troubles, so I write jolly tales." With an established and frequently adapted classic, it's useful to tip your hand and let the audience know what it's in for straightaway. The new film's pacing and rhythm reveals Gerwig's full-gallop approach to the four March sisters (Saoirse Ronan, Emma Watson, Florence Pugh and Eliza Scanlen), their mother (Laura Dern) and their intertwining private lives during and after the Civil War. The way Gerwig handles them, the March family's stories are treated as a disarming comedy of manners under serious, cloudy skies. She doesn't stop there: By the end of Gerwig's "Little Women," Alcott's story and Jo March's story dovetail into a third, hybrid tale of one woman's freedom from want. -- Michael Phillips, Chicago Tribune
"Marriage Story" ****
R, 2:16, drama
Writer-director Noah Baumbach, who for a time was married to actress Jennifer Jason-Leigh, has made a plainly but not entirely autobiographical account of the end of a marriage. Specifically his film -- beautiful, witty, sad and hopeful -- concerns the two or three dog years (i.e., they feel like 14 or 21, not two or three) that come after the end. The story also involves an 8-year-old boy growing up, trying to learn two new languages: the Divorced Mother tongue and Divorced Dadspeak. To those who may think they're in no mood for this one because they've been there-done that, all I can say is this movie is terrific. And The casting -- Scarlett Johansson, Adam Driver, Laura Dern, Julie Hagerty, Alan Alda, Ray Liotta, etc. -- defies improvement. -- Michael Phillips, Chicago Tribune
"1917" *** 1/2
R, 1:58, drama
Designed as two long, unbroken shots, Sam Mendes' film is astonishing -- a feat of cinematography, production design and performance moving seamlessly as one piece. But the most incredible thing about "1917" is how often you forget about the trick of it all, absorbed in character and story rather than any "gimmick." Two young lance corporals, Blake (Dean-Charles Chapman) and Schofield (George MacKay), are given the order to deliver a message by morning to a battalion of British soldiers who are walking into a trap. Chapman gives one of the most heartbreaking performances of the year, while McKay's physicality, both explosive and intimate, is astounding. -- Katie Walsh, Tribune News Service
"Parasite" ****
R, 2:11, comedy-thriller
The Kim family lives in a tiny apartment in Seoul, where the clever forger daughter Ki-jung (Park So-dam) and her mild-mannered brother Ki-woo (Choi Woo-shik) brandish their cellphones, seeking out some stray neighborhood Wi-Fi in various corners of the flat. The family gets by folding cardboard pizza boxes for a living. Father Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho) and mother Chung-sook (Jang Hye-jin) wonder if that's all there is. In short order all the Kims find employment by deceptive means in the home of the wealthy Park family. It's a pleasure watching this con click into place. When the Parks go away on a camping trip, the drunken revels and smashed glassware lead the Kim clan to a discovery that leads to increasingly sinister and bloody doings. The screenplay stays clearly, even doggedly on point in its themes of class resentment and economic warfare. The shift into varying suspense thriller guises, and finally into disarming depths of feeling, works like magic, both inevitable and unpredictable. -- Michael Phillips, Chicago Tribune
"Queen & Slim" ***
R, 2:12, drama
A man (Daniel Kaluuya) whose real name we never learn is a devout Christian who works at Costco. He meets a woman (Jodie Turner-Smith), likewise nameless, who has made her career as a criminal defense attorney and has just lost a murder trial. Her client, we learn, will be executed. After dinner, the man is driving the woman home as they suss out their conflicting hopes for the rest of the evening. After a momentary swerve behind the wheel, the man is pulled over at a squad car's request. The cop is white. Three minutes later, two shots have been fired, there's a dash-cam video destined to go viral, the officer has expired on the pavement and the man and the woman decide to run. Each new vignette brings the couple closer to their escape to Florida, and then Cuba. Along the way the fugitives become ever more famous, and one character refers to them as "Bonnie and Clyde," though plenty of other films and characters exert more direct influences on this one2. Death hangs heavily over "Queen & Slim." So does love, and a fierce, reckless embrace of life -- black lives, specifically, but as with any vital film, the specifics point to more than one story or set of circumstances. -- Michael Phillips, Chicago Tribune
"The Rhythm Section" **
R, 1:49, drama, mystery
Blake Lively, as bullet-for-hire and perpetual wig-changer Stephanie Patrick, discusses possible employment opportunities with Sterling K. Brown, who plays a shadowy fixer with international connections. Our heroine's ultimate target: a radical Islamic terrorist who may be responsible for killing her entire family. In all their scenes, Lively and Brown talk like they're in a spy movie – in comically low tones, so questions sound like statements. Statements that sound like two people trying to fool the polygraph. It's a battle of the deadpan mutterers, and the actors are highly trained in the art of portraying chameleons with plenty to hide. The film doesn't have much to say; it's more about non-verbal suffering and atmosphere, and it certainly has a distinctive, ashen-toned look to show for itself. The material, equal parts Mata Hari and Jason Bourne, is another story. You could call it tried and true, or you could call it tired and false. The movie is made well, if you're buying what it's selling, and if you don't consider a story or a script crucial to the quality of a thriller. -- Michael Phillips, Chicago Tribune
"The Song of Names" ** 1/2
PG-13, 1:53, drama
Music is merely the impetus and the frame for a densely interwoven detective story that stretches across multiple timelines. In 1951 London, a young Polish Jew named Dovidl Rapoport is set to electrify an audience of critics, dignitaries and other members of the city's upper crust, but he never shows and isn't heard from again. Cut to 35 years later, when Dovidl's childhood best friend Martin (Tim Roth), follows a trail all the way to Eastern Europe in an effort to find his old buddy and get some answers. In the late '30s, Martin's father agreed to take the preternaturally gifted Dovidl into his home to help develop his talent, and the two boys became roommates and inseparable chums in short order. In the '80s timeline, Martin searches doggedly for Dovidl, but when he turns up in the bedraggled form of Clive Owen, it becomes clear that he never wanted to be found. Though Roth and Owen give fine performances, as do the two pairs of children who play their characters at different ages, the soundtrack is the biggest star of the film. But while it makes sense for the film to withhold the musical wallop suggested by the title, much of the film is tangled up in a plodding period mystery that emphasizes handsome production values over hot-blooded emotion. -- Scott Tobias, Variety
"Spies in Disguise" ** 1/2
PG, 1:41, family
This insubstantial but lightly entertaining animated spy feature is a strange tonal mashup that turns the hypermasculine and hyperviolent world of glamorous spies, in the vein of James Bond or "Mission: Impossible," and turns it into kid-friendly family entertainment. It's a film that wonders if conflict could be cuddlier, and if lone wolves can work as a team, or perhaps, a flock. Will Smith voices the smooth Lance Sterling, super spy and the star of his agency, headed up by a tough talking Southern-twanged boss, Joy Jenkins (Reba McEntire). There's a warm message of companionship and teamwork at the center of the film, but what makes it subversive is its emphasis on gentler methods of conflict resolution, or at least less bloody ones. It's refreshing to see bubbles, bubblegum and lots of kitty glitter defeat murderous robots. -- Katie Walsh, Tribune News Service
"Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker" ***
PG-13, 2:21, action-adventure
This final film does the job. It wraps up the trio of trilogies begun in 1977 in a confident, soothingly predictable way, doing all that is cinematically possible to avoid poking the bear otherwise known as tradition-minded quadrants of the "Star Wars" fan base. The first three words of the title crawl are: "The dead speak!" Somehow, somewhere, a phantom version of Emperor Palpatine, ruler of the First Galactic Empire, is sending a signal that he's back in business. The Resistance now must face an adversary known as the Final Order. Daisy Ridley anchors a busy yet simple narrative as Rey, the "last hope of the Jedi," who remains in psychic deadlock with Supreme Leader and bad boy Kylo Ren. Thanks to Ridley, primarily, director and co-writer J.J. Abrams' safety-first approach to rounding out this portion of Disney's crucial income stream retains something like a human pulse. -- Michael Phillips, Chicago Tribune
"The Turning" ***
PG-13, 1:34, mystery
This take on Henry James' 1898 novella "The Turn of the Screw" joins a century's worth of questioners who have puzzled over the story of a young governess bedeviled by ghosts at her new job. Are these ghosts real, or is she just crazy? This version is updated to a more modern era, all the moody gothic vibes enhanced by the film's grunge-era Washington state setting. Mackenzie Davis stars as the young governess, Kate, who leaves behind her life in Seattle out of a desire to help a wealthy young girl, orphaned and abandoned by her last teacher. Flora (Brooklynn Prince) is indeed a charming and delightful child, though the stern British housekeeper Mrs. Grose (Barbara Marten) is anything but, and Flora's older brother, Miles (Fin Wolfhard) is entering his teen years angrily and violently. The crisp Kate intends to shape the privileged "thoroughbreds" right up, if only she can get through the night in this sprawling, creepy manor, packed with huge old paintings of dead ancestors, overstuffed Baroque furniture, a forbidden East Wing, terrifying mannequins and the journal of Miss Jessel, the prior governess who just up and vanished. -- Katie Walsh, Tribune News Service
"Uncut Gems" ***
R, 2:13, drama
We're in the diamond district of Manhattan. The year is 2012. Howard Ratner (Adam Sandler), a compulsive gambler whose entire existence is a six-way parlay in one way or another, feels his luck is about to change. Inside the guts of a large fish packed in ice, a precious raw black opal embedded in rock is making its way to Howard. He hopes to get $300,000 at auction for uncut stones of the title. But his debts and obligations make smooth sailing impossible. This latest nerve-shredder from Josh and Benny Safdie is worth seeing, even if it's not their finest two hours, and even if half of any given audience will resent the hell out of it. Adam Sandler is excellent; even his fans would agree those words don't apply to much of what he does for a living. -- Michael Phillips, Chicago Tribune
"Underwater" ** 1/2
PG-13, 1:35, thriller
Norah (Kristen Stewart) is a mechanical engineer aboard a large structure surrounding the Kepler ocean drill. When the structure is rocked by several massive jolts, she's forced to sacrifice a couple of colleagues while sealing off a passageway to save the whole ship. Soon it's just a small group of survivors, hoping to make their way down to the ocean floor and across to another drilling station. The specter of "Alien" haunts this film -- a damp riff off and tribute to the 1979 extraterrestrial horror thriller. One can imagine the pitch meeting: "It's 'Alien' on the ocean floor!" But it hews so closely one can easily predict each story beat, each reveal, each jump scare. Director William Eubank distinguishes the formulaic film with a jittery artfulness rendered in shades of gray and green, but what elevates the B-movie is the presence of Stewart, who is both a movie star and a great actress. -- Katie Walsh, Tribune News Service
"Weathering With You" **
PG-13, 1:54, animation
In this inventive romantic fantasy from director Makoto Shinkai, a young couple desperate to stay together find themselves contending with all manner of meteorological freakery, with spectacular, if somewhat difficult to follow, results. Hokoda (Kotaro Daigo), a 16-year-old runaway, falls for Hina (Nana Mori), a so-called Sunshine Girl, an exceptionally rare specimen with the power to pray away the gray skies. Her gift comes at a cost, however, and both teens realize that eventually, her ability to tame the weather will reach its limit, and she'll levitate up into the clouds to be vaporized. Or something. The point is, by the movie's own mythology, Sunshine Girls aren't long for this earth. "Weathering With You" blends the emotional concerns of 21st-century teens with elaborate supernatural elements, making for a visually dazzling, narratively convoluted adventure that speaks to the younger generation, but not necessarily the world at large. There's a great deal that simply doesn't translate to American audiences, who may have trouble swallowing the film's outrageous ending and its J-poppy Radwimps score. -- Peter Debruge, Variety<

Nancy Drew is dead? Sleuth's fans push back

Texto completo: The Hardy Boys stand over Nancy Drew's grave. The beloved teen detective, who has survived countless scrapes, cliffhangers and close calls, is dead -- or so it seems -- killed while pursuing a high-stakes investigation of organized crime. And it's up to the Hardy Boys to solve the mystery of her murder.
What a way to celebrate the 90th anniversary of an unstoppable female hero.
The forthcoming comic book series "Nancy Drew & the Hardy Boys: The Death of Nancy Drew!" was intended to commemorate the publication in April 1930 of the first Nancy Drew book by putting a noirish spin on the classic tale of the roadster-driving, truth-seeking sleuth from River Heights.
But the possibility that Nancy -- whose pluck and valor have helped her triumph over villains since the Great Depression -- was murdered infuriated some of her passionate fans. It also sent her name trending on Twitter.
"I'm very surprised" by the blowback, said Anthony Del Col, who wrote the series, which is to be published by Dynamite Entertainment in April.
Del Col said he had envisioned the story as a continuation of a previous series he wrote for Dynamite in which Nancy and the Hardy Boys team up to solve the murder of the boys' father, Fenton, a crime that the boys themselves stand accused of committing.
As in that series, he said, the gritty settings and dark themes in "The Death of Nancy Drew!" were inspired by the conventions of film noir.
"What we tried to do is create one of the ultimate mysteries of Nancy Drew," he said. "How did she die? Who killed Nancy Drew?"
Perhaps the bigger question on the minds of fans: Is she really dead? Del Col refused to say, adding only that readers of the series would find "more than meets the eye."
Some Nancy Drew readers said the possibility that Nancy had been killed, even if she turns up alive in the end, smacked of crass marketing, particularly for a character who has been embraced as a feminist role model.
Hillary Clinton, Nancy Pelosi, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sandra Day O'Connor are among the women who have cited Nancy as an early influence.
"The idea of killing her really flies in the face of her appeal as a character -- if they have killed her, which we don't actually know," said Melanie Rehak, the author of "Girl Sleuth: Nancy Drew and the Women Who Created Her."
"As an idea, it goes against something really fundamental about her -- which is that she's able to get herself out of situations because she's resourceful and clever," Rehak said.
Some Nancy Drew fans also complained that killing Nancy and having the Hardy Boys work to crack the case played into antiquated gender stereotypes, just the kind Nancy herself tried to upend in her books, which have sold more than 80 million copies.
"I doubt Nancy Drew is really dead," Karen Jensen, a librarian and the creator of a website for teen librarians, wrote on Twitter. However, Jensen added, "Taking the lead female out of her anniversary story so boys can investigate her death is an odd & probably misogynistic way to celebrate a profoundly important female character in literature."
Nancy has captivated readers since she first sprang to life as the brainchild of Edward Stratemeyer, the head of a children's literature syndicate who created the Hardy Boys in 1927.
Stratemeyer gave the plotlines for the first Nancy Drew stories to Mildred Wirt, a young newspaperwoman, who fleshed out the books, which were published under the pseudonym Carolyn Keene. Wirt, later Mildred Wirt Benson, wrote Nancy Drew books off and on for two decades.
Rehak said the intense reaction to Del Col's comic book series showed the enduring power of Nancy Drew, even as she has been reimagined over the decades in books, movies, television shows and video games.
"She's still so powerful as a character that it creates an immediate firestorm," Rehak said. "I think that's very significant. There are other characters who would not provoke such outrage."

Texto completo: Full of funky used furniture and irresistible kitsch, Big Al's Superstore was hard to pass without planning to pop in one day. Most of us in Indianapolis probably just wished the striking storefront at College Avenue and 46th Street could be something more interesting.
Enter new Root & Bone restaurant.
When the little shopping center housing Root & Bone was completed in 1927, the Indianapolis Star thought it was about time ordinary folks were treated to attractive architecture. Our "everyday haunts are needlessly too ugly and commonplace," the reporter declared. Not even early tenant Kroger would dare apply gaudy colors that might spoil the facade.
Over time, others were less kind. They covered grand windows with boards the color of key lime pie filling. Big Al's Superstore was known for selling used furniture on the sidewalk.
Since Root & Bone opened Jan. 15, the building's patchwork of Indiana limestone blocks has perhaps never been more captivating. At twilight, under a deep-azure sky, lanterns and backlights illuminate buff stonework framing the golden bustle of diners inside. It's a place you want to stop even after you discover the Southern food menu's signature fried chicken isn't all that.
The famous owners Root & Bone is from Bravo TV "Top Chef" alums Janine Booth, an Australian, and Jeff McInnis, a Florida native. The couple met while cooking together at restaurants in Miami, including McInnis' Yardbird Southern Table & Bar, which has won a semifinalist nod from the James Beard Awards, made a 50 best new restaurants list by Bon Appetit magazine and was billed a top fried chicken spot by Southern Living magazine.
McInnis landed on "Top Chef" Season 5 in 2008, competing against chefs that included Carla Hall, who would go on to become a host of ABC show "The Chew." During a 2018 episode of "The Chew," McInnis proposed to Booth, who appeared on "Top Chef" Season 11 in 2013.
The following year, the Booth and McInnis launched the first Root & Bone in New York. Eater.com said it served the city's "best new fried chicken." But the chefs' romance was not all hearts and accolades. McInnis' ex-wife in 2013 gave the Miami Herald a blistering account of her and McInnis' split.
Life went on. Booth and McInnis have opened and operated restaurants in Miami and Puerto Rico, including Stiltsville Fish Bar, the brand they originally slated for Indianapolis. McInnis told IndyStar in December that plans changed because Root & Bone's Southern bent was a better fit for a Midwest market in love with comfort food. McInnis grew up on his family's farms where he learned country cooking like pickling, frying and making preserves.
The chefs partnered with owner/operator Luke Family of Brands, which briefly brought Tim Horton's to Indianapolis, and IndyCar driver James Hinchcliffe to launch Root & Bone to Indianapolis, according to information from Root & Bone.
The scene Root & Bone, 4601 N.College Ave., is everything countryside chic you want your home to be, right down to gracious, attentive staff.
Booth is the designer. She chose cut-glass spirits decanters to serve as drop lights over the 15-seat bar. Antlers and horns are tap handles. The cocktail list serves Southern charm like bacon-infused scotch and the spicy honey Beekeeper blending mead, habanero and chamomile-infused vodka.
Perfectly folded cotton napkins lay on candlelit blondwood tabletops. Blue willow plates and wooden cutting boards cluster on walls just below exposed-beam ceilings. Grandma china sits between vintage suitcases on a shelf. Some vintage pieces were sourced from surrounding homes in Meridian-Kessler and other areas.
A big-screen window broadcasts a full kitchen view. The restaurant is open for dinner, but weekend brunch is coming soon.
That fried chicken It takes guts to showcase fried chicken on a menu in Indiana. The state is home to a fried chicken trail. In 2019, well-known food writer Michael Ruhlman dedicated an entire New York Times article to the simple salt-and-pepper fried chicken Hoosiers worship.
The two times I tried Root & Bone's sweet-tea-brined chicken dusted in dehydrated lemon powder, it lacked that fresh-from-the fryer crackle Indiana demands. The crust was soft, more like picnic basket fried chicken. I wouldn't order it again, on the bone (half bird, $19; whole bird, $32) or boneless with pickles sandwiched in hefty buttermilk biscuits ($14 a pair).
More appealing are little cast-iron skillets brimming with custardy bread pudding under warm "buttermilk cream" ($8) and mac and cheese ($7) that's sharp and saucy enough to spoon onto Root & Bone's admirable biscuits (2 for $7), McInnis' grandmother's recipe.
Even better are the things you can't find elsewhere in Indianapolis, like finely diced beets and carrots in a "root tartare" boldly seasoned with horseradish, salty capers and black garlic to scoop on thin, crunchy fried root chips ($12). That I'll stop for again and again.

Texto completo: As always, there is so much happening at the Baxter County Library. Here is just a few of the great programs, events and updates from the Library:
Apron Chronicles Apron Chronicles: A Patchwork of American Recollections will be on display at the Baxter County Library from Valentine's Day, Feb. 14 to Mother's Day, May 10.

Apron Chronicles: A Patchwork of American Recollections is America's most nostalgic, thought provoking and generational-friendly traveling exhibition. Touring since 2004, Apron Chronicles presents the American experience through 21 photographs by Kristina Loggia, accompanying text in story form and 50 vintage aprons. Utilizing the apron as a symbol immediately recognized by everyone, Apron Chronicles explores the people behind the aprons and is ultimately more about life than fabric. The exhibit's diverse storytellers include an 111-year
old mother and her only child and more.
Best-selling author EllynAnne Geisel's stories and vintage apron collection give voice to the exhibit, with Loggia preserving the storytellers' images in an environmental style that complements the unadorned honesty of their recollections. Apron Chronicles national recognition includes Time magazine, the New York Times, CBS Sunday Morning and NPR's Weekend Edition.

Texto completo: When Livingston-based The Briad Group, heard of the Taverney family of Edison's need for a handicap accessible door for their wheelchair-bound daughter, Julianna Taverney, 16, who was diagnosed with Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, a rare disease that weakens connective tissues, they jumped at the chance to help. Briad Construction Services, a division of Briad, quickly took action and pulled together plans for not only a handicap accessible door, but also an ADA compliant wheelchair ramp. Chuck Pagnotta, Briad Group's Senior VP of Construction said that Julianna and her family struggled with something so basic in terms of needing to enter the house. He said it's rewarding for Briad's entire team to help the family establish some normalcy and to give Julianna greater independence. According to Taverney's father, the family is really grateful for the support of the community and The Briad Group.

On Feb. 2 the Target store, 1515 Route 22 West reported a man in his early 20s wearing blue jeans and pink sweatshirt removed electronics from the store worth $130 before running toward Route 22. On Jan. 26 the BJ's store, 1601 Route 22 West reported two separate shoplifting incidents by the same suspect, described as a woman wearing a red and black jacket who allegedly removed $261 in candy and gum from the store on Jan. 23 and $298 worth of candy and gum from the store on Jan. 26. On Jan. 25 the Walmart store, 1515 Route 22 West reported a man wearing blue jeans, black hooded sweatshirt, black gloves and mask covering half his face and carrying a tan backpack removed electronics worth $226 and fled on a bicycle.

The man abandoned the merchandise and fled toward Route 22 in a white Ford van. On Jan. 31 Jorge Batz, 24, of North Plainfield was placed under arrest in connection with allegedly driving while intoxicated after he was spotted driving erratically in the parking lot of the Buffalo Wild Wings, stopping the vehicle, exiting and urinating on the ground.

On Jan. 31 Laura Salton, 34, of Watchung was arrested in connection with allegedly shoplifting $275.53 worth of merchandise from Kohl's 1701 Route 22 West.
Bill introduced The New Jersey Attorney General recently prohibited law enforcement in all 21 counties from using Clearview AI's facial recognition software after a New York Times article revealed the start-up had built its database by scrubbing billions of photos from online social media platforms. In light of many concerns regarding the implications of this new technology, Assembly Democrats Andrew Zwicker and Herb Conaway introduced a measure (A-1210) to require the Attorney General or governing body of a county or municipality, as appropriate, to host a public hearing prior to the implementation of any facial recognition technology by a State or local law enforcement agency.

Texto completo: MIDDLETOWN – Australia is on the other side of the world, but the wildfires that have ravaged the country's southeastern coast hit close to home for Finley Elias.
The fourth-grader at Lincroft Elementary School has been there to visit her grandmother and two uncles, both of whom are Australian firefighters, so she decided to take action.
"I saw a bunch of stories and videos about it, and I felt sad about it," Finley said of the fires. "I wanted to do something."
She drew up an eye-catching logo to put on T-shirts, hooded sweatshirts and tote bags with the hope of raising money to help injured and suddenly homeless koalas.
"We thought raising a couple of hundred dollars would be really cool," her father, Scott Elias, said.
The final number: $17,200, all of which will be donated to Port Macquarie Koala Hospital in New South Wales. It happened over the course of just three weeks. Finley's initiative really struck a chord.
"When she came to me with the idea, my heart wanted to burst with pride," said mom Katy Elias, who hails from Australia. "We've met koalas and the native animals, so to see the destruction and for Finley to step up as a little kid, we're all really proud."
The 10-year-old's logo design features the word "Love" with a koala hugging a tree as the "L." More than a thousand items sold thanks to fervent participation by three schools: Lincroft Elementary, Bayshore Middle, where her sister Briella attends, and Monroe Township Middle, where Katy Elias teaches physical education. Diane Brustowicz and Monroe-based B.E. Unique Design handled the custom screen printing and embroidery.
"Finley got on the announcements every morning and shared a little bit about the country and the culture," Lincroft Elementary School Principal Dan Imbimbo said. "She came up with a fantastic design, and it really caught on. The kids are excited to support one another."
Imbimbo said he's had "quite a few students" raise large sums for charities over the past few years.
"Finley's story is unique because she raised so much money, but we have a culture of students here who are really passionate about helping their community," he said. "Kids come into my office at least once a week to pitch an idea. It's been an eye-opening experience and a real blessing to see these kids do this."
The $17,000 will convert to approximately $25,000 in Australian dollars.
"It's helping the hospital fix the koalas and buy stuff for them to help them have a happy life," Finley said. "They live in trees. A lot of the trees are burning. They're not really fast, so it's hard for them to run away if their habitat burns."
It's estimated that tens of thousands of koalas have perished. The New York Times reported that "at least a quarter of the population" may have been lost in New South Wales, which is Australia's most populous state.
Katy Elias said the Port Macquarie Koala Hospital, which typically treats a dozen or so koalas at any one time, is packed with more than 60 right now.

Texto completo: MEERUT, India - Under the shade of a banyan tree, a group of worshippers recite Sanskrit mantras. A couple of men step forward and light a fire. Then they start walking, hands folded, as if in a trance, toward a statue.
Some drape flowers over it. Others sing songs of valor to the statue. It is of Nathuram Vinayak Godse, who assassinated Mohandas K. Gandhi, the revered father of Indian independence and a symbol of nonviolent resistance the world over.
Indians consider Gandhi one of the fathers of their nation. But the rise of a Hindu nationalist government, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has uncorked many extremist beliefs, and admiration for Gandhi's killer, among some, has become more open. It is a sign of how much India has changed in the 5 1/2 years since Modi took power.
"Gandhi was a traitor," said Pooja Shakun Pandey, who blames Gandhi for partition and who participated in a recent ceremony worshipping Godse on the anniversary of Gandhi's assassination. "He deserved to be shot in the head."
Prominent Hindu nationalists still invoke Gandhi, but in many cases they are trying to co-opt his legacy - presenting their policies, however divisive, as congruent with his beliefs. One example: a recent citizenship law pushed by Modi's government that, critics say, discriminates against Muslims and threatens the secular state that Gandhi had envisioned.
Other Hindu nationalists, though, continue to vilify the man admired worldwide as an apostle of peace.
The ceremony at the statue venerating his killer, in Meerut, in the north of the country, is not the only sign of respect for Godse in India these days.
Across the country, more than a dozen statues of Gandhi's killer have been erected. Several Hindu temples are being converted into Godse temples.
Last year the government of Uttar Pradesh state, which is led by a firebrand Hindu monk, Yogi Adityanath, proposed changing the name of Meerut to Godse City. One of the first Godse statues was unveiled there about three years ago. Officials now say they have been overwhelmed by demands for more Godse memorials.
Ramachandra Guha, a preeminent biographer of Gandhi, said that fans of Gandhi's killer were no longer a fringe group. Instead, he said, Godse admiration has found a place among what he considers a worryingly large segment of the population.
"It is foul, despicable, but it is real and widespread," Guha said.
In recent months, vandals with links to right-wing groups have defaced pictures of Gandhi, attacked his memorials and scrawled the word traitor on his picture. In June last year, a statue of Gandhi was decapitated in eastern India.
The growing cult around Godse seems rooted in the same militant brand of Hindu nationalism that inspired Gandhi's killer to shoot him one January evening in 1948.
That day, Gandhi walked slowly across a stately lawn in New Delhi, India's capital, leaning on the shoulders of two young women. Godse stepped out from a crowd, greeted him and touched his feet. He then pulled out a Beretta and shot the frail 78-year-old three times in the upper body.
Godse was born in a small village in central India to an upper-caste family. Three of their older sons died from an unknown illness. Thinking it would protect their new child to treat him as a girl, they pierced the young Godse's nose and made him wear a nose ring until they had another son.
For wearing the nose ring, Godse was called Nathuram, meaning a man with pierced nose.
When he was a young man, Godse joined the RSS, a Hindu nationalist group that many members of India's governing party, including Modi, have been part of.
Godse believed Gandhi had betrayed Hindus by being too conciliatory to Muslims and by allowing Pakistan to break off during the partition of India in 1947. That line is still echoed by many Hindu nationalists who see Godse as a national hero and Gandhi as a traitor.
Technology has helped spread the revisionist attitude toward Godse.
The availability of cheap data in much of the countryside has helped create an ecosystem of disinformation in which it is difficult to sift fact from fiction. WhatsApp messages shared widely in rural areas say that if Godse had not killed Gandhi, India would have fallen apart as the Soviet Union did. Other messages call Gandhi a womanizer.
Public meetings eulogizing Gandhi's killer are also used to spread lies and justify the murder.
Amit Jaiswal Jain, an advertising professional in the town of Agra, believes Godse is a hero because he tried to stop Gandhi's push for India to help the newly formed Pakistan.
"Gandhi should be respected," Jain, 38, said. "But the new India should not tolerate the castigation of Godse."
Jain, along with some of his Hindu nationalist friends, are urging the Uttar Pradesh government to insert a special chapter in school textbooks on Godse. The idea is to present Godse as a visionary for Hindu nationalism and one of the drivers behind the creation of a Hindu nation.
Hindu nationalism - an ideology that animates Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party - is premised on the idea that India is a Hindu nation and that minorities, especially Muslims, must subscribe to Hindu primacy.
Pandey, who was visiting Godse's statue in Meerut recently, is one of the most educated people in her village in northwestern India, earning a doctorate in mathematics and teaching at a local university. She is also a leader of Hindu Mahasabha, a group formed more than 100 years ago that espouses militant Hindu nationalism.
Last year, she was arrested at the scene of Gandhi's killing. In a video that brought her national fame, she is seen shooting Gandhi's effigy.
Pandey runs the Meerut chapter of Hindu Mahasabha with Ashok Sharma. They hold prayer meetings in temples across Uttar Pradesh and exhort people on why this is the time, under Modi, to turn India into a Hindu nation.
On a recent morning in Meerut, Sharma sat for a ritual petitioning Lord Hanuman, the monkey God of Hindu mythology, to ward off Gandhi's spirit.
"Hey, son of the wind," Sharma prayed toward the fire, referring to Lord Hanuman, "remove Gandhi's filthy soul from this pure land."
Pandey said that if Godse were alive she would drink the water used to wash his feet.
"Our hero stopped Gandhi's poison from spreading in this pure land," she said. "If I was born before Godse, I would have shot Gandhi myself."

Bernie Sanders can beat Trump in November Guest columnist

Texto completo: In one way or another, every single Democratic candidate for president has proclaimed that they are the best person to beat Trump in November.
To understand which candidate is correct, voters should ask themselves not who is the best person to beat Trump, but rather what does it take to beat an incumbent president with almost limitless campaign funds and an energized base?
I would say that it takes a massive coalition of working people and the largest voter turnout in American history.
When I think about a successful coalition, what comes to mind is the 1981 mayoral election in the small New England town of Burlington, Vermont. The four-term incumbent Democratic mayor was up against two independents, a businessman and a democratic socialist activist named Bernie Sanders.
Sanders had previously run for office four times, for governor and U.S. Senate. Though his previous attempts had been unsuccessful, what was noticeable was which demographics he was appealing to and where he had garnered the most support.
In a 1981 article, the New York Times wrote: "Mr. Sanders put together an unlikely coalition that included poor people's and tenants' rights organizations, students and faculty members at the University of Vermont here and members of the Burlington Patrolmen's Association and other city workers groups upset over pay and working conditions." You read that correctly, a self-described socialist earned the support of the conservative men in blue.
Bernie Sanders won that election and was re-elected to three more terms.
In 1987, U.S. News and World Report named him one of the nation's 20 top mayors, crediting him "with preserving affordable housing, holding the line on property taxes and making a serious push for home rule in a state where cities had little autonomy." Bernie also made good on his promise to increase the pay of police officers.
Yes, Burlington is a small town. Yes, that was nearly 40 years ago. But when you look at the approach and strategy of that election you see similarities to what Sen. Sanders is doing right now on a national scale (to great success). The major difference is before he had no name recognition and no political power - now he has both, along with the support of national labor unions, elected officials, celebrities, and one of the most effective social media followings of any public figure.
The Democratic party establishment says their nominee needs to be someone who can appeal to Republicans, someone who can get things done, and someone who is not Bernie Sanders.
While caucusing with Democrats in Congress, Bernie has maintained considerable support among conservative voters and no-political-affiliation voters; and he's also actually got things done with Republicans.
In 1990, he beat an incumbent Republican for Vermont's lone seat in the House of Representatives. Winning 56% of the vote, he became the first independent elected to Congress in decades. In reference to his tenure in the House, Bernie is often referred to as the "Amendment King." From 1995 to 2007, he passed 17 roll call amendments which is more than any other member during that time; all of this in a Republican-controlled Congress.
In 2014, Bernie worked with the late Sen. John McCain on legislation to reform the Department of Veteran Affairs. The bill expanded veterans' access to healthcare. Bernie has also worked with Republican Sen. Mike Lee to push legislation asserting congressional oversight of military issues. The two led a bipartisan effort on a war powers resolution to end U.S. support for the military conflict in Yemen. Their bill passed both the House and Senate.
Sen. Sanders is now the longest serving independent and consistently surveyed as the popular politician in Congress. Almost every poll since 2016 has shown that Bernie would beat Trump by the largest margin of any candidate.
The reality is Bernie Sanders has what it takes to beat Trump. The Sanders campaign has more individual campaign contributors and more money in the bank than any Democratic candidate. What he's been able to accomplish is a direct result of being a lifelong organizer, committed to the needs of working class people.
In a time of massive wealth and income inequality, we need a president who understands the economic anxiety felt by so many American citizens, including those who voted for President Trump. Bernie Sanders will lead not just as commander-in-chief but also as organizer-in-chief; and with the help of a massive coalition, build a government that works for all of us.
The author is the organizer and host of Nerd Nite Orlando and the founder of Orlando for Revolution, a chapter of Our Revolution, which was spun out of Sanders' 2016 campaign to continue his work.

Texto completo: A traveler who arrived at Newark Airport from China on Tuesday has been quarantined, although the person did not present any symptoms of coronavirus, officials said.
Officials were notified that the traveler had been in China's Hubei Province, where the city of Wuhan – which is pointed to as the center of the coronavirus outbreak – is located, the state Department of Health said in a statement.
The person, who is not a New Jersey resident, was given a mandatory 14-day quarantine order, and any symptoms will be monitored at "a location in Essex County," the statement said.
"The risk of novel coronavirus transmission in New Jersey residents remains low," the statement said.
The Health Department did not provide additional details on the quarantined person.
Two U.S. State Department-arranged evacuation flights from Wuhan arrived Wednesday in California, where the hundreds of evacuees were expected to be quarantined at military bases. The passengers, Americans who were in Wuhan as the outbreak unfolded, included a 30-year-old New Jersey woman, according to a New York Times report.
There are currently over 24,600 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the world, resulting in 494 deaths, according to official data collected by Johns Hopkins University.
According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, there have been 11 confirmed cases of the virus in the United States, in Washington, Arizona, Illinois, California and Massachusetts.
Health officials cleared two individuals in New Jersey who were tested for the virus in late January.
To be tested, the Health Department said, the patient must have a fever of 100.4 degrees or more and symptoms of lower respiratory illness such as a cough and shortness of breath, and must have traveled from Wuhan, China, within the previous two weeks or had close contact with a person under investigation for infection with the virus while that person was ill.

Texto completo: PIERRE – South Dakota's economy can't be at its peak performance while it has an English-only driver's license test as a barrier for hiring, Rapid City Mayor Steve Allender told senators.
Community leaders, business managers and Latinos from across South Dakota joined in making the case for Senate Bill 70, which would allow the state to offer a Spanish-language written driver's license test, for nearly an hour before the Senate Transportation Committee, which will vote on the bill on Friday. The committee's room was standing room only, with supporters wearing stickers stating, "Let's get to work!"
The bill reconciles South Dakota leaders' statements about supporting businesses with their actions, Allender said. He asked the senators to support local communities, which in turn support the state, national and global economy, by passing SB 70.
"It's not a matter of foreign workers coming here and taking jobs away from Americans. This is about helping the country as a whole fulfill its work obligations, creating those jobs, creating productivity," he said.
The committee heard testimony and asked questions of the testifiers on Wednesday, but didn't discuss or vote on the bill due to the absence of Sen. Deb Soholt, R-Sioux Falls, on Wednesday. Republican Sen. Ernie Otten, the committee's chairman from Tea, said it's an important vote and he wanted a full committee for it.
The bill doesn't change South Dakota's official language and the driving skills portion of the test will still be administered in English. South Dakota, Utah and Wyoming are the only states that don't offer a Spanish-language driver's license test.
No one testified in opposition to SB 70 on Wednesday. The state Department of Public Safety opposed the bill last year, but no one from the state testified either in support or opposition on Wednesday.
New immigrants Bill sponsor Sen. V.J. Smith, R-Brookings, read a letter he had received from South Dakotan telling him that the bill was "ridiculous" because they're in America, where people speak in English.
In 1889, the South Dakota Constitution was printed in four languages so all residents could understand what they were voting on, he said. He regularly heard German spoken between adults when he was growing up in Eureka because that was the language of choice.
It takes time to learn a new language and new immigrants in South Dakota are learning English, but in the meantime, they need to be able to get their driver's license to go to work, Smith said.
"This new wave of immigrants, much like the homesteaders of more than a century ago, simply want a better life for themselves and their families. ... The same as our ancestors did," Smith said.
Sidney Zanin, a business owner in Pierre, came to the United States 34 years ago and said he still struggles sometimes to understand the meaning in written English. His first three years in the country was spent working and being a good resident to keep his green card, he said.
"I didn't have time to do anything else, go to school, learn English. I had to support myself," he said.
Sioux Falls resident Luz Selene Zamorano became an interpreter as an adult because of her experience as a child. When women have to depend on others to drive because they can't pass the English-only driver's license test, it leaves them open to being exploited, she said.
Her mother would drive her to school without a driver's license because she couldn't pass the test, but would then be pulled over and she would have to walk to school instead in their neighborhood that wasn't safe.
Her mother asked a male neighbor to drive her school instead and he would behave inappropriately with her, according to Zamorano.
She didn't feel like she could tell her mother or anyone at school because she felt ashamed. She started coming up with excuses to not go to school, but then the school starting asking her mother where she was. Zamorano said she felt like she had to continue to get rides with the man to school.
"I do not want the same thing to happen to other kids, to other mothers that cannot take their driver's license test in English," she said.
Farming and business The South Dakota Farm Bureau is supporting the bill because it's important in the livestock industry, particularly dairies that hire Spanish-speaking workers, according to its lobbyist, Michael Held. In most instances, the workers live in housing in the small rural towns and it's important to make a driver's test as accessible as possible, he said.
Sister Lynn Marie Welbig of the Presentation Sisters pointed out that immigrants are good enough to do Americans' "grunt work," but they're not good enough to have driver's licenses.
"Is this exploitation? Or what is it? I think we need to really consider our value system here," she said.
The New York Times found last year that Huron has the highest rate of net international migration and that Brookings had the sixth highest rate in 2017-18.
Huron has two processing plants that employ more than 2,000 people and a majority of the workers doing that manual labor are new Americans, Huron's Republican Sen. Jim White said. A majority of students and residents in Huron are new Americans, and Huron embraces those families because new Americans are needed to grow the economy, he said.
The Chambers of Commerce in Sioux Falls, Rapid City, Huron and Brookings spoke in support of SB 70 on Wednesday. Avera and Sanford spoke in support of SB 70, as well as the South Dakota professional organizations representing human resource managers and the homebuilders, auto and trucking, hotel and construction industries.
The Senate Chamber door is open on Jan. 14 at the State Capitol in Pierre.

Texto completo: Linda Poskanzer was having a tough time in her late 60s.
"I was not doing well emotionally," she recalled. "Physically, I didn't have any stamina. I was sleeping a lot. I wasn't getting to work."
A therapist in Hackensack, New Jersey, Poskanzer was severely overweight and grew short of breath after walking even short distances. Her house had become disorganized, buried in unsorted paperwork. The antidepressant she was taking didn't seem to help.
Her son, visiting from Florida, called his sisters and said, "Mommy needs an intervention."
One of her daughters made an appointment with a geriatrician - a physician who specializes in the care of older adults. Dr. Manisha Parulekar, now chief of geriatrics at Hackensack University Medical Center, suggested her new patient take action on several fronts. She arranged for a sleep study, which found that Poskanzer suffered from apnea. She prescribed a different antidepressant and physical therapy in a pool to help rebuild her stamina.
And weight loss. Eventually, the geriatrician agreed that bariatric surgery made sense. Over nine months, Poskanzer lost 75 pounds; she has shed another 15 since.
Now about to turn 80, Poskanzer is still receiving therapy, 30 hours each week, feels "full of spirit" and continues to see her geriatrician every four months. "She sits and talks, which a lot of doctors don't do anymore," Poskanzer said. "And she knows me. I feel very well taken care of."
Testimonials like this spotlight the rising need for geriatricians. These doctors not only monitor and coordinate treatment for the many ailments, disabilities and medications their patients contend with, but also help them determine what's most important for their well-being and quality of life.
Patients like Poskanzer often can't easily find geriatricians like Parulekar, however. As the nation's older population surges, the gap between need and supply has steadily widened, and a persistent shortage of geriatricians has troubled the medical profession for years.
Geriatrics became a board-certified medical specialty only in 1988. An analysis published in 2018 showed that over 16 years, through the academic year 2017-18, the number of graduate fellowship programs that train geriatricians, underwritten by Medicare, increased to 210 from 182. That represents virtually no growth when adjusted for the rising U.S. population. "It's basically stagnation," said Aldis Petriceks, the study's lead author, now a medical student at Harvard.
Moreover, geriatrics fails to attract enough young doctors to the graduate fellowships it does offer. Leaving aside geriatric psychiatry, more than a third of 384 slots went unfilled last year, the American Geriatrics Society reports.
If one geriatrician can care for 700 patients with complex medical needs, as a federal model estimates, the nation will need 33,200 such doctors in 2025. It has about 7,000, only half of them practicing full time.
Why do so few residents choose to specialize in geriatrics? Though salaries are rising, total compensation (wages along with certain benefits) for geriatricians in 2018 averaged $233,564, according to the Medical Group Management Association. Anesthesiologists earned twice as much; radiologists and cardiologists topped $500,000.
"These are smart people looking at economic reality," said Dr. Mark Supiano, a geriatrician and researcher at VA Salt Lake City Health Care System. Treating patients covered by Medicare, which pays less than commercial insurance, is a slow way to repay medical school loans.
Nor does the field offer much glamour or the prospect of medical heroics. "Having patience, having good communication skills, it's a different personality than being a surgeon," Supiano acknowledged. Yet a much-cited 2009 survey of 42 medical specialties found that geriatricians reported higher career satisfaction than most.
Not every older person needs a geriatrician, but the federal model estimates that 30% of the over-65 population does. This is especially true "when someone has three or more chronic conditions and is over 85," said Nancy Lundebjerg, chief executive of the American Geriatrics Society.
That describes Dorothy Lakin, 93, whose recent medical history includes heart failure, macular degeneration, falls, colon cancer and heart valve surgeries, and a stroke.
"She's had a zillion trips to the ER, one after another," said her daughter Mary Ellen Lakin, 70, who lives in Newton, Massachusetts. "I thought, 'Let's see if there's a way to make her life easier.' "
Mary Ellen Lakin found her way to Dr. Laura Nelson Frain, a geriatrician at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, who has gently steered mother and daughter through the past year. She reduced the number of medications Dorothy Lakin took and the specialists she saw, stayed in touch with Mary Ellen and sent a geriatric nurse-practitioner to make house calls.
"It's less of 'Let's order this med, let's order that procedure,' more of a holistic approach," Mary Ellen Lakin said. Her mother recently entered hospice care.
Still, given the numbers, "we're not going to address this growing older population through some miraculous influx of specialized geriatricians," Petriceks said.
Leaders in geriatrics agree, and while they continue working to bolster their numbers, they're also adopting other strategies. Dr. Mary Tinetti, chief of geriatrics at the Yale School of Medicine, has called for geriatricians to serve as "a small, elite workforce" who help train whole institutions in the specifics of care for older adults.
"The most important thing geriatricians can do is make sure all their other colleagues" understand these patients' needs, she said, including nurse-practitioners, physician assistants and pharmacists.

Texto completo: MEERUT, India - Under the shade of a banyan tree, a group of worshippers recite Sanskrit mantras. A couple of men step forward and light a fire. Then they start walking, hands folded, as if in a trance, toward a statue.
Some drape flowers over it. Others sing songs of valor to the statue. It is of Nathuram Vinayak Godse, who assassinated Mohandas K. Gandhi, the revered father of Indian independence and a symbol of nonviolent resistance the world over.
Indians consider Gandhi one of the fathers of their nation. But the rise of a Hindu nationalist government, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has uncorked many extremist beliefs, and admiration for Gandhi's killer, among some, has become more open. It is a sign of how much India has changed in the 5 1/2 years since Modi took power.
"Gandhi was a traitor," said Pooja Shakun Pandey, who blames Gandhi for partition and who participated in a recent ceremony worshipping Godse on the anniversary of Gandhi's assassination. "He deserved to be shot in the head."
Prominent Hindu nationalists still invoke Gandhi, but in many cases they are trying to co-opt his legacy - presenting their policies, however divisive, as congruent with his beliefs. One example: a recent citizenship law pushed by Modi's government that, critics say, discriminates against Muslims and threatens the secular state that Gandhi had envisioned.
Other Hindu nationalists, though, continue to vilify the man admired worldwide as an apostle of peace.
The ceremony at the statue venerating his killer, in Meerut, in the north of the country, is not the only sign of respect for Godse in India these days.
Across the country, more than a dozen statues of Gandhi's killer have been erected. Several Hindu temples are being converted into Godse temples.
Last year the government of Uttar Pradesh state, which is led by a firebrand Hindu monk, Yogi Adityanath, proposed changing the name of Meerut to Godse City. One of the first Godse statues was unveiled there about three years ago. Officials now say they have been overwhelmed by demands for more Godse memorials.
Ramachandra Guha, a preeminent biographer of Gandhi, said that fans of Gandhi's killer were no longer a fringe group. Instead, he said, Godse admiration has found a place among what he considers a worryingly large segment of the population.
"It is foul, despicable, but it is real and widespread," Guha said.
In recent months, vandals with links to right-wing groups have defaced pictures of Gandhi, attacked his memorials and scrawled the word traitor on his picture. In June last year, a statue of Gandhi was decapitated in eastern India.
The growing cult around Godse seems rooted in the same militant brand of Hindu nationalism that inspired Gandhi's killer to shoot him one January evening in 1948.
That day, Gandhi walked slowly across a stately lawn in New Delhi, India's capital, leaning on the shoulders of two young women. Godse stepped out from a crowd, greeted him and touched his feet. He then pulled out a Beretta and shot the frail 78-year-old three times in the upper body.
Godse was born in a small village in central India to an upper-caste family. Three of their older sons died from an unknown illness. Thinking it would protect their new child to treat him as a girl, they pierced the young Godse's nose and made him wear a nose ring until they had another son.
For wearing the nose ring, Godse was called Nathuram, meaning a man with pierced nose.
When he was a young man, Godse joined the RSS, a Hindu nationalist group that many members of India's governing party, including Modi, have been part of.
Godse believed Gandhi had betrayed Hindus by being too conciliatory to Muslims and by allowing Pakistan to break off during the partition of India in 1947. That line is still echoed by many Hindu nationalists who see Godse as a national hero and Gandhi as a traitor.
Technology has helped spread the revisionist attitude toward Godse.
The availability of cheap data in much of the countryside has helped create an ecosystem of disinformation in which it is difficult to sift fact from fiction. WhatsApp messages shared widely in rural areas say that if Godse had not killed Gandhi, India would have fallen apart as the Soviet Union did. Other messages call Gandhi a womanizer.
Public meetings eulogizing Gandhi's killer are also used to spread lies and justify the murder.
Amit Jaiswal Jain, an advertising professional in the town of Agra, believes Godse is a hero because he tried to stop Gandhi's push for India to help the newly formed Pakistan.
"Gandhi should be respected," Jain, 38, said. "But the new India should not tolerate the castigation of Godse."
Jain, along with some of his Hindu nationalist friends, are urging the Uttar Pradesh government to insert a special chapter in school textbooks on Godse. The idea is to present Godse as a visionary for Hindu nationalism and one of the drivers behind the creation of a Hindu nation.
Hindu nationalism - an ideology that animates Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party - is premised on the idea that India is a Hindu nation and that minorities, especially Muslims, must subscribe to Hindu primacy.
Pandey, who was visiting Godse's statue in Meerut recently, is one of the most educated people in her village in northwestern India, earning a doctorate in mathematics and teaching at a local university. She is also a leader of Hindu Mahasabha, a group formed more than 100 years ago that espouses militant Hindu nationalism.
Last year, she was arrested at the scene of Gandhi's killing. In a video that brought her national fame, she is seen shooting Gandhi's effigy.
Pandey runs the Meerut chapter of Hindu Mahasabha with Ashok Sharma. They hold prayer meetings in temples across Uttar Pradesh and exhort people on why this is the time, under Modi, to turn India into a Hindu nation.
On a recent morning in Meerut, Sharma sat for a ritual petitioning Lord Hanuman, the monkey God of Hindu mythology, to ward off Gandhi's spirit.
"Hey, son of the wind," Sharma prayed toward the fire, referring to Lord Hanuman, "remove Gandhi's filthy soul from this pure land."
Pandey said that if Godse were alive she would drink the water used to wash his feet.
"Our hero stopped Gandhi's poison from spreading in this pure land," she said. "If I was born before Godse, I would have shot Gandhi myself."

The world of mezcal evolves and grows

Texto completo: From the consumer's view, the world of mezcal in 2020 is radically different from that of 10 years ago. Del Maguey, which 25 years ago pioneered the discovery and marketing in the United States of small-production, geographically specific bottles, is still going strong, though its visionary founder, Ron Cooper, sold a controlling interest in the brand to the beverage giant Pernod Ricard in 2017.
Rather than packaging his discoveries as a luxury brand or with celebrity tie-ins in the fashion of tequila, mezcal's agave cousin, Cooper emphasized the cultural significance of mezcal, highlighting its ability - through traditional, laborious methods of production - to transmit the character of a place and a people.
But where 10 years ago, Del Maguey alone seemed to be shining a light on the enormous potential and complexity of mezcal, now more than a few entrepreneurs, no doubt inspired by Cooper's example, have entered the artisanal mezcal business.
While "artisanal" has become a marketing buzzword, it seems to mean something more with mezcal. Entrepreneurs with dollar signs in their eyes have gotten into the act, no surprise, but the best and most interesting bottles are still the most rustic and distinctive, rather than the most polished.
Nowadays, dozens of small-production bottles are available, each highlighting the styles of small mezcaleros, or mezcal makers, local production techniques and the various sorts of agaves that are permitted to be used in mezcal production.
Unlike tequila, which can be produced only from the blue agave in the state of Jalisco and a few surrounding areas, mezcal can legally be made in 10 Mexican states with any sort of agave.
Practically speaking, though, most mezcal comes from Oaxaca, and most of the time it's made from the espadín agave. Yet it's not rare to find mezcals made of other sorts of agaves with names like barril, jabalí, cuishe, tepeztate and tobalá.
To get a sense of the evolved world of mezcal today, the spirits panel recently tasted 20 bottles. For the tasting, Florence Fabricant of The New York Times and I were joined by two drinks writers and historians, David Wondrich and Robert Simonson.
Mezcal, like tequila, often comes with an age statement: joven, or young; reposado, which is aged in oak for up to a year, and añejo, which is aged one to three years. I love the purity of agave spirits undistorted by oak, so for this tasting we stuck to joven.
As usual, we bought all the bottles retail, and we capped the selections at $100 a bottle, which ruled out quite a few. Even without the most expensive choices, we all marveled at the high level of quality in the tasting. We were floored by the wide variety of flavors, complex and strange in the best possible way.
In the past I had come to think of smokiness as the defining feature of mezcal. In this tasting, smokiness, which comes from roasting the agaves in rock-lined pits before fermentation, was just one of many components.
We found aromas and flavors of herbs, vegetables, jalapeños, flowers and a lot more, often in combinations that seemed to vary widely from bottle to bottle.
What accounts for such variety? Partly, it's a reflection of the diversity of raw materials. Agaves take a long time to grow, and can vary in age. Some are harvested after five years, others after many more.
It's also a function of production techniques - copper pot stills are most common, for example, but some mezcaleros still use clay stills.
Local traditions differ as well. Sometimes mezcals are redistilled with grains or nuts to add flavor.
It's often said by mezcal enthusiasts that the spirit needs to be at least 45% alcohol to show its true character. Perhaps that's true. Seven bottles in our tasting had alcohol levels under 45%, and only two of those made our top 10.
Our top bottle was the Rezpiral Abel Martínez Series Four, named after the mezcalero who produced it. It was briny, deep and complex with a pronounced saline quality.
No. 2 was the subtle, complex, lightly smoky Agave de Cortés Espadín, the sort of spirit in which you seem to taste something different with every sip. By contrast, the No. 3 Sombra was rich, deep and assertive, though not as complex. At $35, it was also our best value.
I recognize that many of these mezcals may be difficult to find. The good news is that even if you cannot find the precise bottles that we tasted, many of these brands offer a variety of different bottlings, made by other mezcaleros in different villages using their own techniques and sometimes other sorts of agaves.
They are all worth trying. No doubt, you will find favorites that we did not taste. With mezcal circa 2020, discovery is part of the thrill.

Texto completo: Linda Poskanzer was having a tough time in her late 60s.
"I was not doing well emotionally," she recalled. "Physically, I didn't have any stamina. I was sleeping a lot. I wasn't getting to work."
A therapist in Hackensack, New Jersey, Poskanzer was severely overweight and grew short of breath after walking even short distances. Her house had become disorganized, buried in unsorted paperwork. The antidepressant she was taking didn't seem to help.
Her son, visiting from Florida, called his sisters and said, "Mommy needs an intervention."
One of her daughters made an appointment with a geriatrician - a physician who specializes in the care of older adults. Dr. Manisha Parulekar, now chief of geriatrics at Hackensack University Medical Center, suggested her new patient take action on several fronts. She arranged for a sleep study, which found that Poskanzer suffered from apnea. She prescribed a different antidepressant and physical therapy in a pool to help rebuild her stamina.
And weight loss. Eventually, the geriatrician agreed that bariatric surgery made sense. Over nine months, Poskanzer lost 75 pounds; she has shed another 15 since.
Now about to turn 80, Poskanzer is still receiving therapy, 30 hours each week, feels "full of spirit" and continues to see her geriatrician every four months. "She sits and talks, which a lot of doctors don't do anymore," Poskanzer said. "And she knows me. I feel very well taken care of."
Testimonials like this spotlight the rising need for geriatricians. These doctors not only monitor and coordinate treatment for the many ailments, disabilities and medications their patients contend with, but also help them determine what's most important for their well-being and quality of life.
Patients like Poskanzer often can't easily find geriatricians like Parulekar, however. As the nation's older population surges, the gap between need and supply has steadily widened, and a persistent shortage of geriatricians has troubled the medical profession for years.
Geriatrics became a board-certified medical specialty only in 1988. An analysis published in 2018 showed that over 16 years, through the academic year 2017-18, the number of graduate fellowship programs that train geriatricians, underwritten by Medicare, increased to 210 from 182. That represents virtually no growth when adjusted for the rising U.S. population. "It's basically stagnation," said Aldis Petriceks, the study's lead author, now a medical student at Harvard.
Moreover, geriatrics fails to attract enough young doctors to the graduate fellowships it does offer. Leaving aside geriatric psychiatry, more than a third of 384 slots went unfilled last year, the American Geriatrics Society reports.
If one geriatrician can care for 700 patients with complex medical needs, as a federal model estimates, the nation will need 33,200 such doctors in 2025. It has about 7,000, only half of them practicing full time.
Why do so few residents choose to specialize in geriatrics? Though salaries are rising, total compensation (wages along with certain benefits) for geriatricians in 2018 averaged $233,564, according to the Medical Group Management Association. Anesthesiologists earned twice as much; radiologists and cardiologists topped $500,000.
"These are smart people looking at economic reality," said Dr. Mark Supiano, a geriatrician and researcher at VA Salt Lake City Health Care System. Treating patients covered by Medicare, which pays less than commercial insurance, is a slow way to repay medical school loans.
Nor does the field offer much glamour or the prospect of medical heroics. "Having patience, having good communication skills, it's a different personality than being a surgeon," Supiano acknowledged. Yet a much-cited 2009 survey of 42 medical specialties found that geriatricians reported higher career satisfaction than most.
Not every older person needs a geriatrician, but the federal model estimates that 30% of the over-65 population does. This is especially true "when someone has three or more chronic conditions and is over 85," said Nancy Lundebjerg, chief executive of the American Geriatrics Society.
That describes Dorothy Lakin, 93, whose recent medical history includes heart failure, macular degeneration, falls, colon cancer and heart valve surgeries, and a stroke.
"She's had a zillion trips to the ER, one after another," said her daughter Mary Ellen Lakin, 70, who lives in Newton, Massachusetts. "I thought, 'Let's see if there's a way to make her life easier.' "
Mary Ellen Lakin found her way to Dr. Laura Nelson Frain, a geriatrician at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, who has gently steered mother and daughter through the past year. She reduced the number of medications Dorothy Lakin took and the specialists she saw, stayed in touch with Mary Ellen and sent a geriatric nurse-practitioner to make house calls.
"It's less of 'Let's order this med, let's order that procedure,' more of a holistic approach," Mary Ellen Lakin said. Her mother recently entered hospice care.
Still, given the numbers, "we're not going to address this growing older population through some miraculous influx of specialized geriatricians," Petriceks said.
Leaders in geriatrics agree, and while they continue working to bolster their numbers, they're also adopting other strategies. Dr. Mary Tinetti, chief of geriatrics at the Yale School of Medicine, has called for geriatricians to serve as "a small, elite workforce" who help train whole institutions in the specifics of care for older adults.
"The most important thing geriatricians can do is make sure all their other colleagues" understand these patients' needs, she said, including nurse-practitioners, physician assistants and pharmacists.

The world of mezcal evolves and grows

Texto completo: From the consumer's view, the world of mezcal in 2020 is radically different from that of 10 years ago. Del Maguey, which 25 years ago pioneered the discovery and marketing in the United States of small-production, geographically specific bottles, is still going strong, though its visionary founder, Ron Cooper, sold a controlling interest in the brand to the beverage giant Pernod Ricard in 2017.
Rather than packaging his discoveries as a luxury brand or with celebrity tie-ins in the fashion of tequila, mezcal's agave cousin, Cooper emphasized the cultural significance of mezcal, highlighting its ability - through traditional, laborious methods of production - to transmit the character of a place and a people.
But where 10 years ago, Del Maguey alone seemed to be shining a light on the enormous potential and complexity of mezcal, now more than a few entrepreneurs, no doubt inspired by Cooper's example, have entered the artisanal mezcal business.
While "artisanal" has become a marketing buzzword, it seems to mean something more with mezcal. Entrepreneurs with dollar signs in their eyes have gotten into the act, no surprise, but the best and most interesting bottles are still the most rustic and distinctive, rather than the most polished.
Nowadays, dozens of small-production bottles are available, each highlighting the styles of small mezcaleros, or mezcal makers, local production techniques and the various sorts of agaves that are permitted to be used in mezcal production.
Unlike tequila, which can be produced only from the blue agave in the state of Jalisco and a few surrounding areas, mezcal can legally be made in 10 Mexican states with any sort of agave.
Practically speaking, though, most mezcal comes from Oaxaca, and most of the time it's made from the espadín agave. Yet it's not rare to find mezcals made of other sorts of agaves with names like barril, jabalí, cuishe, tepeztate and tobalá.
To get a sense of the evolved world of mezcal today, the spirits panel recently tasted 20 bottles. For the tasting, Florence Fabricant of The New York Times and I were joined by two drinks writers and historians, David Wondrich and Robert Simonson.
Mezcal, like tequila, often comes with an age statement: joven, or young; reposado, which is aged in oak for up to a year, and añejo, which is aged one to three years. I love the purity of agave spirits undistorted by oak, so for this tasting we stuck to joven.
As usual, we bought all the bottles retail, and we capped the selections at $100 a bottle, which ruled out quite a few. Even without the most expensive choices, we all marveled at the high level of quality in the tasting. We were floored by the wide variety of flavors, complex and strange in the best possible way.
In the past I had come to think of smokiness as the defining feature of mezcal. In this tasting, smokiness, which comes from roasting the agaves in rock-lined pits before fermentation, was just one of many components.
We found aromas and flavors of herbs, vegetables, jalapeños, flowers and a lot more, often in combinations that seemed to vary widely from bottle to bottle.
What accounts for such variety? Partly, it's a reflection of the diversity of raw materials. Agaves take a long time to grow, and can vary in age. Some are harvested after five years, others after many more.
It's also a function of production techniques - copper pot stills are most common, for example, but some mezcaleros still use clay stills.
Local traditions differ as well. Sometimes mezcals are redistilled with grains or nuts to add flavor.
It's often said by mezcal enthusiasts that the spirit needs to be at least 45% alcohol to show its true character. Perhaps that's true. Seven bottles in our tasting had alcohol levels under 45%, and only two of those made our top 10.
Our top bottle was the Rezpiral Abel Martínez Series Four, named after the mezcalero who produced it. It was briny, deep and complex with a pronounced saline quality.
No. 2 was the subtle, complex, lightly smoky Agave de Cortés Espadín, the sort of spirit in which you seem to taste something different with every sip. By contrast, the No. 3 Sombra was rich, deep and assertive, though not as complex. At $35, it was also our best value.
I recognize that many of these mezcals may be difficult to find. The good news is that even if you cannot find the precise bottles that we tasted, many of these brands offer a variety of different bottlings, made by other mezcaleros in different villages using their own techniques and sometimes other sorts of agaves.
They are all worth trying. No doubt, you will find favorites that we did not taste. With mezcal circa 2020, discovery is part of the thrill.

Texto completo: President Donald Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell shared a moment during the State of the Union address on Tuesday.
Just shy of the one-hour mark in Trump's speech, the president gave a shoutout to the Kentucky Republican: "Working with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and his colleagues in the Senate, we have confirmed a record number of 187 new federal judges to uphold our Constitution as written."
"Thank you, Mitch," Trump added.
McConnell, who is typically stoic, cracked a toothless grin and waved as Trump paused for cheers.
Though Trump was singling out McConnell's ushering of federal judge confirmations, the president had reason to thank the majority leader on Wednesday.
The Senate voted Wednesday to acquit Trump on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. This vote, to strike down the House of Representatives' two articles of impeachment, came in no small part due to McConnell's Senate maneuvering.
Here's how it unfolded:
'Total coordination' with White House Five days before the House even approved the articles of impeachment on Dec. 18, McConnell took to television to say he would be in "total coordination with the White House counsel" as the impeachment process moved forward.
During an interview with Sean Hannity on Fox News, McConnell said that "everything" he does "during this, I'm coordinating with the White House counsel. There will be no difference between the president's position and our position as to how to handle this, to the extent that we can."
McConnell stayed true to his word. The day before the House passed the articles of impeachment, the Senate leader planted the seeds for an argument he would continue making: Democrats led a "slapdash" and unfair investigation, and Trump should not be impeached in the first place.
The longtime senator said "I'm not an impartial juror" that same day when discussing the looming impeachment trial, adding that it is "a political process."
And from the moment the House passed the articles of impeachment, McConnell played hardball with his lower chamber counterpart, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.
Pelosi, D-Calif., initially held on to the impeachment articles, saying she wanted to hear more about how McConnell would conduct the trial. The Senate leader was not phased by Pelosi's threat, saying he was "not anxious to have this trial."
No witnesses — even after Bolton revelations At the heart of the impasse between the two leaders was the calling of additional witnesses. Pelosi wanted an agreement that would arrange for specific witnesses to testify, whereas McConnell insisted that no decision would be made on witnesses until after opening statements from House managers and White House defense lawyers as well as the submission of written questions from senators.
Pelosi blinked first and sent the articles to the Senate on Jan. 15. The following day, almost a month after saying he was not an impartial juror, McConnell and his Senate colleagues each took the following oath that is stated in the chamber's rules on impeachment:
"I solemnly swear (or affirm, as the case may be) that in all things appertaining to the trial of the impeachment of Donald John Trump, now pending, I will do impartial justice according to the Constitution and laws: So help me God."
The week following the oath, McConnell passed rules that delayed the witness vote despite some protests from Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, and minor tweaks to the leader's original guidelines.
As the witness vote approached in the second week of the trial, the proverbial storm hit. The New York Times reported on Jan. 26 that former national security adviser John Bolton says in his upcoming book that Trump told him he did not want to release military aid to Ukraine until that country helped with investigations that could damage Democrats, including former Vice President Joe Biden.
Bolton was already on the Democrats' list of desired witnesses — and the pressure cranked up on McConnell, who "did not have any advance notice" that the National Security Council reportedly had a copy of Bolton's manuscript for weeks, according to a spokesperson.
Democrats needed four GOP defectors from the 53-member Republican caucus to call witnesses. After the Bolton revelations, Republican Sens. Mitt Romney and Susan Collins, of Utah and Maine, respectively, indicated they would listen to 75% of Americans and vote to subpoena additional witnesses.
Two days after The Times report, on Jan. 28, McConnell told his Republican caucus in a private meeting that he did not yet have the votes to block witnesses. But just as it looked like McConnell's house of cards could fall, the master strategist reigned in the troops.
On Jan. 29, McConnell held a private meeting with Sen. Lisa Murkowski, a potential GOP swing vote from Alaska who had previously criticized McConnell for his "total coordination" comments.
Two days later, on Jan. 31, Murkowski announced she was a "no" vote on calling additional witnesses. Later that afternoon, the Senate voted 51-49 to strike down the measure — all but guaranteeing Trump's acquittal.
'Reject the House's abuse of power' On Tuesday, McConnell made some of his final remarks of the impeachment trial: a plea to his colleagues to acquit Trump and to "reject the House's abuse of power."
"We have done our duty," McConnell said Tuesday. "We have considered all arguments. We have studied the 'mountain of evidence.' And tomorrow, we will vote.
"We must vote to reject the House's abuse of power. Vote to protect our institutions. Vote to reject new precedents that would reduce the Framers' design to rubble," he continued.
McConnell concluded by urging his colleagues to "cast the vote that the facts in evidence, the Constitution and the common good clearly require: Vote to acquit the president of these charges."
Right before the impeachment vote took place Wednesday afternoon, McConnell took the floor one last time.
"We will reject this incoherent case that comes nowhere near — nowhere near — justifying the first presidential removal in history," McConnell said. "This partisan impeachment will end today."
McConnell got his wish, finishing the trial with the ultimate victory: Trump's acquittal.

Google Investigation Focuses on Ad Tools

Texto completo: The Justice Department has contacted more than a dozen companies in its antitrust probe of Google, including publishers, advertising technology firms and advertising agencies, as the company's online ad tools become a major focus of the investigation, according to people familiar with the matter.
In recent months, the department has been posing increasingly detailed questions -- to Google's rivals and executives inside the company itself -- about how Google's third-party advertising business interacts with publishers and advertisers, the people said. That digital business was built largely on the company's 2008 acquisition of the ad-technology firm DoubleClick.
Many of the questions center on two moves that Google has made in recent years that publishers and rivals say have helped consolidate its power. The first was Google's integration of its ad server, the leading tool for websites to put ad space up for sale, with its ad exchange, the industry's largest digital ad marketplace. The second was its decision to require advertisers to use its own tools to buy ad space on YouTube.
"They are zooming in on the right topics, and that's a good thing," said Michael Nevins, chief marketing officer of Smart AdServer, the maker of a rival ad technology to Google's.
Google's ad-tech business consists of software used to buy and sell ads on sites across the web. The company owns the dominant tool at every link in the complex chain between online publishers and advertisers, giving it unique power over the monetization of digital content. Many publishers and advertising rivals have charged that it has tied these tools together and to its owned-and-operated properties such as search and YouTube in anticompetitive ways.
Google, a unit of Alphabet Inc., has argued that the ad-tech industry is competitive and that moves it made to merge products were aimed at creating a better experience for customers.
The probe's increasing emphasis on ad tech is one reason the department's antitrust chief, Makan Delrahim, recused himself last week, people familiar with the investigation said. In 2007, Mr. Delrahim advised Google in its efforts to get approval from the Federal Trade Commission to buy DoubleClick.
In addition to probing digital advertising, Justice Department officials are examining other aspects of Google's business. Some of the companies that have been interviewed are rivals hurt by the dominance of its search and mobile businesses, such as Yelp, DuckDuckGo and Oracle Corp., according to some of the people familiar with the matter.
Wall Street Journal publisher News Corp, a longtime Google critic, was among the publishers contacted by antitrust investigators, along with New York Times Co., Gannett Co., Nexstar Media Group Inc. and Conde Nast, some of the people said. Bloomberg earlier reported on contacts with some of the publishers.
State attorneys general who are pursuing their own Google investigation met Tuesday with Justice Department officials, a potential step toward closer coordination of the two probes.
The state officials sent out a subpoena to Google in the fall that was dominated by questions on the inner workings of its ad-tech products.
Much of the Justice Department's questioning has focused on the "sell side" of Google's technology -- that is, products like DoubleClick for Publishers, which connects online publishers to Google's advertising exchange. Virtually all major news publishers use that Google software. DoubleClick for Publishers and the exchange, commonly known as AdX, were rebranded as a single product called Google Ad Manager in 2018.
In the past two months, the department's outreach to advertising agencies indicates it is also interested in the "buy side," the people familiar with the matter said. The investigation puts the agencies in a delicate spot because many of them use Google's tools and rely on Google as a major advertising client.
The growing regulatory scrutiny has prompted some Google executives to discuss informally whether the company should consider divesting itself of its third-party ad-tech business, according to people familiar with the situation. People close to Google said the company is still responding to informational requests from the Justice Department and hasn't begun to discuss any potential changes to its business with the department.
Those who want to explore divesting the business note that it has steadily declined in importance to Google overall since the DoubleClick purchase, while units like search and YouTube have soared.
In part, this is because the legacy DoubleClick business is focused on display advertising on desktop websites, and desktop web traffic has stopped growing as web users have shifted their time and attention toward mobile devices, the people familiar with the situation said.
"We have no plans to sell or exit this business," Google spokeswoman Julie Tarallo McAlister said.
Google's parent, Alphabet, doesn't break out financial results for its third-party ad-tech business specifically. The unit is part of Google's business of servicing its network of website partners, which accounted for $21.5 billion in 2019, about 13% of the company's overall revenue. That is down from 31% in 2008, the year the DoubleClick deal closed.
Google says it passes about 70% of this revenue on to its network partners. Google's third-party ad business represents a fraction of the revenue of its reported Google Network Members unit, and has weighed on the profits of that segment, according to people familiar with the business.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - The U.S. Senate voted Wednesday to acquit President Donald Trump on abuse of power and obstruction of Congress charges and allow him to remain in office, ending the third impeachment trial in American history.
The Senate acquitted Mr. Trump by a 52-48 vote on the abuse of power charge and by a 53-47 vote on the obstruction of Congress charge.
Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, was the only Republican who broke with his party to join all 45 Democrats and two independents in voting "guilty" on the abuse of power charge. He became the first senator in U.S. history to vote to remove a president in his own party.
"The president is guilty of an appalling abuse of public trust," Mr. Romney said in a Senate floor speech before the vote. "Corrupting an election to keep oneself in office is perhaps the most abusive and destructive violation of one's oath of office that I can imagine."
Pennsylvania's senators were split on the verdict, with Democrat Bob Casey voting to convict and Republican Pat Toomey voting to acquit on both charges.
The result of Wednesday's verdict was not a surprise: From the outset, it was highly unlikely the Republican-controlled Senate would get to the 67 votes required for Mr. Trump's removal. The previous two presidential impeachment trials resulted in acquittals for Andrew Johnson in 1868 and Bill Clinton in 1999.
The acquittal, coming hours after Mr. Trump delivered a defiant State of the Union address, brings to a close a four-month investigation and trial that paralyzed much of Capitol Hill and exposed deep partisan divides.
Several moderate Democrats, hailing from states that voted overwhelmingly for Mr. Trump, decided to vote "guilty."
Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., who earlier in the week proposed the Senate censure the president instead of removing him from office, ultimately voted to convict on both charges. West Virginia voted for Mr. Trump in 2016 by 42 percentage points.
Sen. Doug Jones, D-Ala., voted to convict as he faces a difficult re-election fight in a deep-red state. Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz., did the same.
In its verdict, the Senate ultimately sided with White House defense lawyers who argued that Mr. Trump's actions to pressure Ukraine into announcing an investigation into a political rival did not meet the constitutional standard for removing a president from office.
The chamber rejected the arguments and evidence presented by a team of six House Democrats who prosecuted the case against Mr. Trump.
The House Democrats accused Mr. Trump of abusing his power by freezing nearly $400 million in military aid to Ukraine and delaying a White House meeting with its new president to extort the American ally into helping his prospects in this November's election.
Mr. Trump, the Democrats asserted, demanded that Ukraine announce a probe into a Ukrainian energy firm, Burisma, on whose board sat Hunter Biden, son of former Vice President Joe Biden.
In December, the House voted 228-187 to impeach Mr. Trump, setting the stage for the trial.
Much of Mr. Trump's trial was consumed in a furious debate, mostly behind the scenes, over whether to call witnesses who refused to testify or issue subpoenas for documents the White House refused to turn over.
Senators voted at the start of the trial to reject calling witnesses and documents. And, on Friday, after hearing 36 hours of arguments and questioning the prosecution and defense, senators voted again to reject the move. That vote effectively brought the trial to a close.
The rejection of witnesses was unprecedented in Senate impeachment trials of both presidents and federal judges. The Senate called 41 witnesses in Andrew Johnson's trial and called three witnesses for private depositions in Mr. Clinton's trial.
But Mr. Trump's acquittal, coming about nine months before the 2020 presidential election, is unlikely to put to rest the underlying accusations of the case.
New revelations are expected to leak out from witnesses that the Senate declined to call and, eventually, from documents the White House refused to provide.
John Bolton, Mr. Trump's former national security adviser, plans to publish an explosive book in March that reportedly details direct conversations with the president about the hold on Ukraine aid. The Senate voted to reject Democrats' efforts to call Mr. Bolton as a witness.
Mr. Bolton, whose book is called "The Room Where It Happened: A White House Memoir," resigned in September days before the impeachment inquiry started.
Mr. Romney, in his floor speech Wednesday, said he wanted to hear from Mr. Bolton "not only because I believed he could add context to the charges, but also because I hoped that what he might say could raise reasonable doubt and thus remove from me the awful obligation to vote for impeachment."
The House's next steps to get more answers from Mr. Bolton are unclear.
Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., chair of the House Intelligence Committee, said on "Meet The Press" on Sunday that "the truth will come out" whether "it's in testimony before the House or it's in his book."
On Monday, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., another House impeachment manager, promised that "whatever happens in this impeachment trial, we will remain vigilant in the House."
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., criticized the Senate proceeding as a sham. "You cannot be acquitted if you don't have a trial," she told reporters last Thursday.
Meanwhile, two Republican senators filed a request for travel records for the Bidens.
Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, and Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., sent a letter to Secret Service Director James Murray as part of a probe into "potential conflicts of interest posed by the business activities of Hunter Biden and his associates during the Obama administration."
Mr. McConnell, in his floor speech Wednesday, acknowledged the political fighting over Mr. Trump's case will continue.
"This episode is one of a symptom of something much deeper," he said. "One side has decided that defeat simply means the whole system is broken."
"There is no sign the attacks on our institution will end here," Mr. McConnell added. He criticized Ms. Pelosi's remarks that she would not recognize the verdict.
"Perhaps she'll tear up the verdict like she tore up the State of the Union address," Mr. McConnell said, referring to Ms. Pelosi's act of ripping Mr. Trump's speech in half on national television. "Is this really where you want to go?"
Through it all, American public opinion has been split almost exactly down the middle on impeachment.
A Pew Research Center survey published Jan. 22 found 51% of Americans believe Mr. Trump should be removed from office. The research organization conducted that survey among 12,638 U.S. adults over two weeks ending Jan. 19.
The verdict also marked the final moments for John Roberts, chief justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, to preside in the Senate chamber. He directed a clerk to read the full text of the two articles and then asked senators, "how say you?" in response to the charges.
One by one, senators rose from their desks and issued their verdict - shouting "guilty" or "not guilty" - as the clerk called on them to respond.
After the votes were tallied, Mr. Roberts declared the president "is hereby acquitted of said charges."

Texto completo: As the European Union considers a five-year ban on facial recognition technology, affording lawmakers the opportunity to conduct research and craft meaningful regulation, revelations regarding the practices of an American facial recognition company should motivate Congress to consider its own temporary ban on the technology.
Facial recognition software has been controversial for some time now. The technology has the ability to compare photos taken by, say, a surveillance camera with a larger pool of photos - driver's license pictures, mug shots, etc. The software then connects the images, thus giving the user the identity of the person captured on surveillance image.
Law enforcement and government officials have celebrated the technology's ability to identify criminals, while civil liberty and privacy advocates fear facial recognition could infringe upon the rights of every citizen whose image is captured and examined.
To this point, facial recognition has relied upon pre-existing photo databases, curated by law enforcement or the government. But Clearview AI, a relatively new facial recognition company founded by Australian entrepreneur Hoan Ton-That, has pushed the technology into disturbing new territory.
According to an investigative report published by The New York Times, Clearview's software is groundbreaking in its scope. A user can upload a picture of a person, which is then cross-referenced with Clearview's photo database - a database that has been constructed by scraping more than 3 billion images from social media sites like Facebook, YouTube, Venmo and more.
Clearview's "innovation" has sparked a lot of interest in the U.S. law enforcement community. The company has partnered with more than 600 state and federal agencies throughout the country. Officials claim that Clearview has been used to solve crimes ranging from theft to fraud to murder. The Indiana State Police say Clearview helped solve a shooting within 20 minutes of the incident.
Despite the excitement the software has created among law enforcement, Clearview's business model is rife with concerns related to civil liberties, criminal justice and privacy.
Even the most rigorously tested facial recognition systems are not 100% accurate. In fact, they are inaccurate an alarming amount of the time, particularly when identifying people of color. But Clearview's system has not been scrutinized by independent third parties or industry experts. And because large databases increase the risk of misidentification, Clearview's system could be even more likely to provide false positives, which could lead to wrongful arrests.
There are also many concerns about the data Clearview has accumulated, who may have access to it and how the software could be used. Any person who appears in a photo that has been posted on social media - in other words, most Americans - could be identified by Clearview. From there, the opportunities for abuse are myriad.
Congress should see the current conversation around Clearview and facial recognition as reason to take action. Clearview's decision to transgress the unofficial rules of facial recognition have made it clear that real rules must be created, to protect citizens from unlawful intrusion by private companies, law enforcement and the government.
U.S. lawmakers should take a cue from the EU and impose their own temporary ban on facial recognition technology. The suspension would give researchers time to study facial recognition's accuracy, its effects in other countries (facial recognition is already commonplace in China) and create recommendations for future regulations.
The dangers of facial recognition are too numerous to allow its spread to continue unabated. The U.S. is on a slippery slope to accepting a surveillance state. We need more research, evidence and debate before facial recognition can become the norm.

Lewinsky works to rewrite her story

Texto completo: It was 22 years to the day since the last president to be impeached uttered the unforgettable words — “I did not have sexual relations with that woman, Miss Lewinsky" — and “that woman" was still trying to clear her name.
Monica Lewinsky was on Twitter, reminding journalists that there are names besides hers that could be used to invoke the last impeachment. Why not cite the year (1998) or the name of the president who was actually being impeached (Bill Clinton) rather than relying on that old familiar “Lewinsky Scandal"?
“Let's not frame it by the woman + youngest, least powerful person involved," Lewinsky wrote amid the current impeachment trial, prompting immediate apologies from some journalists.
Then came the haters. How about referring to “the consenting adult who knowingly seduced a married man?" one proposed. Another posted a cartoon sketch of a very recognizable Lewinsky, nearly naked. Another offered a Taylor Swift video GIF: “Oh there she goes, playing the victim ... again."
This is what it still is to be Monica Lewinsky in 2020.
The world's most reviled intern, blamed for nearly bringing down a presidency with a beret and a blue dress, faces humiliation and ridicule every time she stands up against online humiliation and ridicule. Now 46, she has impressed many on social media with her wit, self-awareness, and canny ability to seize the opportunity of the #MeToo movement. Reporters and feminists who dismissed her in the 1990s as just another bimbo are newly cognizant that many other women have been branded as bimbos, attention-seekers, and liars to serve a predator's purpose. They are looking at Lewinsky from a new sheepish perspective.
Yet to many Americans, Monica will always be Monica — someone whose narrative they helped write. She will never be viewed sympathetically by many who see her downfall as unforgivably consensual, a train wreck she gleefully engineered.
“Lewinsky is complicated because there's not really public consensus on whether she's a victim or an agent or some combination of the two," said Nancy Whittier, a professor of sociology at Smith College whose studies include women's movements, social change, and sexuality. “She has to walk a really fine line because she was a participant in this really politically charged moment, and she's trying to talk about her own experience and cyberbullying in a way that isn't politically aligned."
After a decade of self-imposed exile and earning a master's degree in social psychology from the London School of Economics, Lewinsky emerged six years ago as a social activist. She spoke at Forbes magazine's 30 Under 30 Summit, wrote a Vanity Fair essay about her experience, and delivered a 2015 TED talk called “The Price of Shame," in which she declared it was time to “take back my narrative."
This wasn't just about saving herself, she said. This was about all of us, the way we caricature and badmouth and bully one another online. Her talk addressed not just her own painful experience, but those of people like Tyler Clementi, the Rutgers University student who killed himself in 2010 after his roommate secretly recorded and circulated video of him kissing another man.
Dubbing herself “Patient Zero" in a global epidemic of online shaming, Lewinsky began speaking for all those put in the virtual public stockade — and these days, that could be anyone, she made clear. You no longer need to have an affair with a president to warrant worldwide humiliation. You could make a stupid quip on Twitter.
“When this happened to me, 17 years ago, there was no name for it. Now we call it cyberbullying," Lewinsky said in her TED talk.
That made Lewinsky's irreplicable experience relatable, her willingness to speak out about it.
“Talking about the emotional effects of that experience, talking about how that affected her personally, is really pretty savvy," said Whittier, noting that activists against domestic violence and rape have been most effective when focused on the personal impact.
Lewinsky also spearheaded public antibullying campaigns, including one that was nominated for an Emmy and a powerful new public service announcement — called “The Epidemic" — that forces viewers to confront the unseen impact of online bullying in real life.
And last week, she stepped into the partisan fray over President Trump's impeachment trial, chiding Republican senators for their unwillingness to demand witnesses and noting that she'd been compelled to testify on video.
Not everyone can hear that message from Lewinsky, though. A recent announcement that Lewinsky will be hosting “A Conversation on Shame and Survival" this spring at the New Bedford Lyceum, which markets itself as a community forum for open-minded intellectual debate, elicited online criticism that bordered on shaming.
“People feel quite strongly. Twenty years later to feel that strongly — I have to say, I'm a little surprised by that," said Patti Rego, director of marketing and communications for the Marion Institute, one of the organizers.
She, too, was dismayed by the whole torrid affair in 1998, finding it “stupid," she admits. And when she first heard that Lewsinsky was remaking herself as an activist, she thought, “Oh, Monica."
But Rego was floored by Lewinsky's TED talk and began reconsidering her own role in an early public shaming.
“We did her wrong. I did her wrong," said Rego. “They've made rap songs about her. She's almost like a verb."
Organizers renamed the May 15 talk — “A Conversation with Monica Lewinsky on Cyberbullying and the Culture of Humiliation" — to “give people one more chance to put aside their preconceptions," said Rego.
“She's got a personal story and she's using it to connect with people," said Rego. "But she's not asking us to forgive her. This is not the Monica Lewinsky apology tour."
Lewinsky has already apologized for her affair, and she acknowledges regret in her talks. Clinton, who was impeached but not removed from office for perjuring himself by denying their affair in sworn testimony, has apologized publicly but not directly to Lewinsky.
He reportedly expresses more remorse about her treatment in the upcoming Hulu documentary, “Hillary," which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival last month. “I feel terrible about the fact that Monica Lewinsky's life was defined by it, unfairly I think," Clinton is quoted as saying.
Hillary Clinton was also further defined by the episode, faulted for demonizing another woman and enabling her husband, who had been accused of seducing, harassing, and even raping women over the years. In the 2016 presidential campaign, Donald Trump brought those accusers to face Hillary Clinton at a televised debate. In the #MeToo era, Democrats and feminists have been reexamining their willingness to discount the testimony of women who accused a man they wanted to believe in.
In 1998, even feminist icon Gloria Steinem stuck up for Clinton, writing a controversial New York Times op-ed that argued some of his alleged passes at women didn't constitute harassment and that distinguished his relationship with Lewinsky as consensual.
In hindsight, even Steinem has high praise for Lewinsky. “How she has endured her unfair treatment is incredible to me," Steinem told the Globe last week. “And she has emerged smart and wise and kind and sane."
For her second act, Lewinsky is holding herself out as a symbol of resilience, telling other bullying survivors, “You can insist on a different ending to your story."
It's a very American construct. But families and cultures also play a role in shaping and reinforcing personal narratives, noted Kate McLean, a Western Washington University professor who studies them.
"We don't get to only tell our own stories," McLean said. “You can't say, 'Here's who I am now,' if no one believes you. Self and identity change is dependent upon the person wanting to change and other people hearing the new story."

Texto completo: Stress may indeed be responsible for those pesky gray hairs you've been noticing that are making you look so — ahem — distinguished, scientists at Harvard say.
The scientists, in a study of mice, found that nerves activated by stress cause permanent damage to cells in hair follicles that generate pigment, the university said in a statement.
The study was published last month in the journal Nature.
“When we started to study this, I expected that stress was bad for the body — but the detrimental impact of stress that we discovered was beyond what I imagined," senior author Ya-Chieh Hsu, the Alvin and Esta Star associate professor of stem cell and regenerative biology, said in the statement.
Nerves from the sympathetic nerve system, which governs the “fight or flight" response, branch out to each hair follicle. Stress causes the nerves to release the chemical norepinephrine. That chemical causes excessive activation of stem cells that convert into pigment-producing cells that color the hair — and prematurely eliminates the supply of those cells.
The “acute stress leads to hair graying through the fast depletion of melanocyte stem cells," the study said.
And there's no turning back. If you're gray, it's going to stay.
“After just a few days, all of the pigment-regenerating stem cells were lost. Once they're gone, you can't regenerate pigments anymore. The damage is permanent," Hsu said.
Bing Zhang, lead author of the study, said in the statement that it was a result of a collaboration with many scientists across a wide range of disciplines, and used a combination of approaches.
“Stress is a normal part of life, but there are situations where stress is helpful and situations where it is detrimental," Subroto Chatterjee, a biologist at Johns Hopkins University who studies the effects of stress on the cells in blood vessels, told The New York Times.
Other studies have shown that stress is just one factor affecting how quickly hair goes gray, Dr. Chatterjee said. Genes and diet play a big role as well.
In a 2018 study, Dr. Chatterjee and his colleagues found that mice placed on the equivalent of a Western diet — high in fat and cholesterol — not only developed inflamed arteries, they also started going gray and experiencing hair loss.
(The team also found a way to halt the process.)
The Harvard scientists said their discovery wasn't just about hair. It meant that they had taken steps toward understanding the impact of stress on other tissues and organs in the body.
They raised the prospect that their discovery could one day pave the way for a cure to gray hair — or other stress-related ills.
“Understanding how our tissues change under stress is the first critical step toward eventual treatment that can halt or revert the detrimental impact of stress. We still have a lot to learn in this area," Hsu said.
Professor Christopher Deppman, a biologist at the University of Virginia, told the Guardian, “I believe that we have only scratched the surface of whether and how stress and fight-or-flight mechanisms deplete other stem cell populations. Whether or not this is the cause of premature aging remains to be determined, but I wouldn't bet against it."
“Like any good study, it opens up at least as many questions as it answers, but it may represent an important stepping-stone toward rationalizing and developing pharmaceutical fountains of youth," he said.

Texto completo: Readers discuss what it means for the president ("he can get away with anything"), and for the country. One says in jest that if democracy is over, he has a monarch to offer.
To the Editor:
Re "Trump Acquitted" (nytimes.com, Feb. 5):
The Senate can no longer fairly be called the "world's greatest deliberative body." Last week the Senate's Republican majority abandoned even a pretense of having a fair and open impeachment trial by voting down a proposal to call for witnesses or even allowing new documentary evidence to be introduced.
Now, after faux deliberations, the Republicans have concluded the proceeding with a vote to acquit President Trump (except for a solitary beacon of decency, Mitt Romney). This was the antithesis of deliberation; it was a sham trial and a swift follow-through to a foregone conclusion seemingly reached before the trial even began.
Make no mistake, this acquittal will be seen by many of our citizens not as a legitimate exoneration of the president, but rather as a blatant cover-up. Of course, President Trump and Republican Party leaders will continue to deny that he committed unconstitutional acts. But, in the end, the truth usually prevails and lying always has consequences.
The result, however unexpected it may seem at this moment, may be that in November a "blue wave" will wash away the Republican majority in the Senate, and we will find that the Democrats have been swept back into the White House.

To the Editor:
Re "Why I'm Voting to Acquit President Trump," by Rob Portman (Op-Ed, nytimes.com, Feb. 5):
Senator Portman, you and your party have made three arguments. First, that soliciting foreign interference in an American election does not "rise to the level" of an impeachable offense. I'm sure you're aware that many constitutional scholars say that this is exactly what the framers worried about. I suspect you'd see it differently if a Democratic president did exactly the same thing. By ignoring this blatant attempt at manipulating an American election, you're opening a floodgate that will not easily be closed.
Second, you argue that the Democratic investigation was slapdash. If you were sincere you could have made it less so by voting to call witnesses. Moreover, Republicans also argue that this impeachment is too close to an election. You can't have it both ways -- every additional day that Democrats spend investigating is an additional day closer to the election.
Finally, you argue that the Senate should be addressing America's problems. You will have ample opportunity to show that you are sincere by urging your Republican colleagues to take up some of the many bills that the House of Representatives has passed. As a voter in your state, I hope you do this, but I will also be surprised.

To the Editor:
Re "Collins Will Not Support Removal of the President" (news article, Feb. 5):
Senator Susan Collins said President Trump has learned a great deal from impeachment. She is absolutely right. He has learned that his fundamental working assumption -- that he can get away with anything -- is correct.
He has learned that the Republicans will sacrifice the norms of liberal democracy to get re-elected. He has learned to use the White House and his presidential powers to enforce protection racket politics at home and abroad. And he has learned that the Democratic Party doesn't have a clue how to stop him.
If he were my student, I'd give Trump an A+ in political learning.

To the Editor:
Now that the Senate has acquitted a president on plausible charges of abusing his power -- declining even to hear from witnesses -- I think we must regretfully declare the American experiment with democracy over.
We had a good run and can rightfully be proud of our rise from colonial backwater to world power. But it is now time to return to a more established form of governance with a far longer track record.
As it happens, we have a rare opportunity to reverse the decision made in 1776 by installing a member of the British royal family who happens to be out of a job and is currently house-hunting on this side of the Atlantic. He even has an American wife. Clearly the stars are aligning.
Long live King Harry of America and his gracious Queen Meghan!

Texto completo: Diminished in scope but not ambition, the men's shows prove that even the malling of Manhattan can't dampen designers' spirit.
"I don't think there really is a right time to start a business," Carter Altman said Monday before his presentation at the kickoff of New York Fashion Week: Men's, an event that nowadays barely merits the grandiose name. For a start, it covers little more than three days, features fewer designers than in any recent season (under two dozen) and has a single headline designer in Todd Snyder.
Mr. Snyder, whatever his considerable chops, is hardly the household name Tom Ford is. And Mr. Ford, who is as of Jan. 1 the chairman of the Council of Fashion Designers of America, the group that schedules and oversees the twice yearly gathering, will hold his fashion show on Friday in Los Angeles.
Mr. Altman has a point, though. The time is never optimal for a fashion start-up in a town like New York, with its astronomical rents, dwindling ranks of wholesale suppliers and a garment district that big tech swallowed whole. Seen through that lens, that independent designers would still elect to show here says as much perhaps about native pluck as skill, and maybe also a kind of indomitable naïveté.
Mr. Altman, whose label is called Carter Young, is 21 and newly graduated from New York University. Though he has no retail clients yet (his work sells online at carteryoung.shop), what he does have is talent and a precociously developed viewpoint. For his presentation at New York Men's Day, he edited his ideas down to a tight grouping of deceptively simple and durable stuff: a cropped and boxy patch-pocket sports coat, a slightly off-kilter denim barn jacket, some letter carrier trousers, a coat upcycled from the same fabric used to make uniforms for the California Highway Patrol.
There was a so-called vegan suit, rough cowhide belts intended to shred over time and get gnarly, and an Eisenhower jacket and shirting embroidered with silhouettes drawn from the artist Kristin Beaver's "Sidekick Portraits."
Ms. Beaver's images were first created in the decaying, yeasty and intensely creative city that was the ruined Detroit of the early aughts. The loft building where New York Fashion Week: Men's takes place is the kind of rough industrial holdout that abounded in Manhattan in the 1970s, when areas of this city looked an awful lot like the ruin Detroit would soon become. That loft building is now hemmed on all sides by glass-walled skyscrapers that form the Hudson Yards development. Although the gleaming cynical hulk of that mall was just across 10th Avenue from the loft building, it felt light years away from the raw aspirations on view during New York Men's Day.
In reality, there may be few commercial prospects available in a landscape dominated by malls and mass chain retailers for independent designers like Pablo Leon, a young Mexican-American designer whose family members worked as undocumented field hands in California's Central Valley.
"As Mexicans we had to be invisible there," Mr. Leon said before a show that, as in the work of Willy Chavarria, a powerful Mexican-American designer also from Fresno, fused hothouse theatricality, ruffs and surplices and other ecclesiastical elements with some sartorial markers of gang culture. "I was invisible being brown and being gay. The problem is how to be seen."
The customary mobs turned out for New York Men's Day in their usual wonderful glad rags -- and following them, the predictable packs of street style photographers. Often it is hard to say which is more compelling, what's on the runway and what drifts in off the street. Just as challenging is imagining what will become of the mountains of images captured of people like Paris Warren, who walked eastward on Monday from 10th Avenue into a throng of professional shutterbugs and at least one reporter wielding his iPhone camera.
What was it we were each so eager to document? For me, it was the droll way Mr. Warren, a creative director and stylist, both updated and queered the look of macho '70s blaxploitation film stars -- the leather jacket with floppy lapels stitched in white, the snuggly mock turtleneck and the snugly knotted durag made from an Hermès scarf.
Moments like that generate their own brand of ephemeral magic. You want to bottle it just as you hope someone may find a way to harness the reverberant energy of labels like Official Rebrand, whose collection was so rife with wacko references -- graffiti, sloganeering, kiddie sketches and femme-butch dualities -- that if the designer, MI Leggett, omitted the kitchen sink it must have been an oversight.
You hope that the Timo Weiland, Donna Kang and Alan Eckstein, the talents behind the label Timo Weiland, can finally make a paying career out of plumbing the depths of their youthful nerdiness. ("I played piano and had my hair permed into an Asian Afro when I was a kid," Ms. Kang explained.) You want their assortment of separates in Necco wafer colors and fireplug red suits to wear for shocking the judge at your pretrial hearing to find their way into the wider world.
You wish for someone like Aaron Potts, who started APOTTS to "fill my life with beauty, creativity, passion, direction and people I love and who inspire me" after being laid off from a job he loathed, he said, to connect with backers able to support a vision for a fashion future in which people dress, if they care to, like a cross between a Mormon Elder and a roadie for Sun Ra's Arkestra.
In a recent Instagram post promoting an evening discussion on "The Search for Signs of Intelligence in Men's Fashion" (held at the CORE Club, that YMCA for the 1 percent), the Airmail columnist Richard David Story decried what he judged to be the sorry state of men's fashion and the sheer madness of what he sees on the runways of New York, Milan, Paris and also the pages of The New York Times.
Conundrums and outrages of the sort that fuss Mr. Story are at the heart of events, however uncommercial, like New York Fashion Week: Men's, and of what remains of fashion creativity in this town. In reality, there is no shortage of opportunities for men to drag up in three-piece suits or stuffy French-cuff shirts or the general attire of "Businessman Realness."
But why bother? For all that ails it, New York fashion, including that for men, could use a healthy a dose of "Funny Face" medicine. "Banish the black!" as Kay Thompson famously intoned in that 1957 cinema classic. "Think pink!"

Texto completo: FACIAL RECOGNITION
Venmo Demands End To Harvesting of Images
The payment service Venmo has joined YouTube and Twitter in demanding that Clearview AI, a facial recognition company, stop harvesting user images to identify the people in them.
The start-up has drawn scrutiny following investigative reports in January by The New York Times and Buzzfeed detailing its work with law enforcement agencies and its practice of scraping social media and other internet platforms for images.
"Scraping Venmo is a violation of our terms of service and we actively work to limit and block activity that violates these policies," Justin Higgs, a company spokesman, said on Wednesday. He said the company was in the process of sending a cease-and-desist letter.
Clearview's chief, Hoan TonThat told CBS that it has a First Amendment right to the three billion images it has collected. He also said the technology was used only by law enforcement to identify potential criminals. ASSOCIATED PRESS
MEDIA
Spotify to Buy The Ringer, A Website and Podcaster
The website and podcasting network The Ringer will soon become the property of Spotify, the companies said on Wednesday. The terms of the deal, which is expected to close by the end of the first quarter, were not disclosed.
Bill Simmons, a writer, sports commentator, podcaster and internet entrepreneur, started The Ringer in 2016 after he left ESPN in a bitter dispute. As an employee of the sports media giant, he founded the sports and culture website Grantland.
ESPN did not renew his contract in 2015 and closed Grantland months later.
The site has a lineup of more than 30 podcasts, including "The Bill Simmons Podcast" and "The Rewatchables." It publishes original articles daily and houses a video network, a film production division and a book imprint.
Last year, Mr. Simmons told The Wall Street Journal that the site was profitable. In a statement on Wednesday, he said he believed that "Spotify can take us to another level." KATIE ROBERTSON AND NOAM SCHEIBER
NETWORKING
LinkedIn's Chief Is Set To Leave After 11 Years
Jeff Weiner is stepping down as chief executive of LinkedIn, the professional networking service, after 11 years. Ryan Roslansky, senior vice president of product, will become the new chief executive beginning on June 1.
Mr. Weiner, who will become executive chairman, said the timing felt right personally and professionally, with a ready successor.
LinkedIn, which is owned by Microsoft, is a social network for workers and job seekers. Recruiters use it to find new hires. Users can share their résumés, search for jobs and catch up on career advice and the latest news.
The service has about 675 million members, compared with 33 million when Mr. Weiner joined LinkedIn as chief executive in 2008.
Microsoft bought the company for $ 26 billion in 2016. LinkedIn's annual revenue was $ 6.8 billion in the fiscal year that ended in June, up 28 percent from the previous fiscal year. ASSOCIATED PRESS

Texto completo: The proposed order, called "Making Federal Buildings Beautiful Again," favors classical design for buildings in Washington. It has drawn opposition from architects.
WASHINGTON -- Should every new government building in the nation's capital be created in the same style as the White House?
A draft of an executive order called "Making Federal Buildings Beautiful Again" would establish a classical style, inspired by Greek and Roman architecture, as the default for federal buildings in Washington and many throughout the country, discouraging modern design.
The order, spearheaded by the National Civic Art Society, a nonprofit group that believes contemporary architecture has "created a built environment that is degraded and dehumanizing," would rewrite the current rules that govern the design of office buildings, headquarters, and courthouses, or any federal building project contracted through the General Services Administration that costs over $ 50 million.
"For too long architectural elites and bureaucrats have derided the idea of beauty, blatantly ignored public opinions on style, and have quietly spent taxpayer money constructing ugly, expensive, and inefficient buildings," Marion Smith, the group's chairman, wrote in a text message. "This executive order gives voice to the 99 percent -- the ordinary American people who do not like what our government has been building."
But the proposed executive order has already drawn fierce opposition from architects who say it would have a dampening effect on architectural thought and give President Trump broad power to make aesthetic appraisals, something critics say he knows nothing about.
"At the most fundamental level it's a complete constraint on freedom of expression," said Roger K. Lewis, an architect and a professor emeritus of architecture at the University of Maryland who has written extensively about design and planning in Washington. "This notion that the White House has expertise or knowledge or understanding of architecture and design sufficient to allow them to mandate that all federal buildings be classically styled is absurd."
The hope among the order's authors could be to put it in front of President Trump sometime within the next month, according to one person familiar with its development. It would explicitly discourage some modern forms of architecture -- including the Brutalist-influenced Federal Bureau of Investigation headquarters on Pennsylvania Avenue whose appearance Mr. Trump has criticized -- in favor of classical design.
If a style other than classical is proposed for a project, the order establishes a high bar for getting approval: it would establish a presidential "re-beautification" committee to review designs and would still give the White House final say. Benjamin Forgey, the former architecture critic for The Washington Post, called the order "profoundly mischievous," and said it would eliminate the ability of architects to consider contemporary design and context when creating new government spaces.
He held up the National Gallery of Art as a model of the "conversation" between modernist and classic structures. The West building, designed by the architect John Russell Pope and finished in 1940, was modeled after the Roman Pantheon. The East building, designed by the Chinese-American architect I.M. Pei and completed in 1978, is a triangular design influenced by modernist thought.
Though the order would only apply design rules to federal public buildings and some memorials whose designs are developed through the General Services Administration, not Smithsonian-funded museums, Mr. Forgey described the museum as a civic and architectural medley that would be less common if the order is successful.
"It's an example of why we need contemporary thought in architecture," Mr. Forgey said. "It's what makes contemplating and experiencing cities enjoyable."
The order also accuses the G.S.A.'s Design Excellence Program, which directs the federal government's multibillion-dollar building program, of encouraging the proliferation of modern styles, arguing that "the federal government has largely stopped building beautiful buildings the American people want to look at or work in."
In an email, Amale Andraos, the dean of the Columbia Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation, said the G.S.A. program had encouraged a proliferation of different architectural styles and ideas.
"There was a time when the United States' leadership could be seen through the cultural sophistication of its government building programs where architecture was asked to exude power but did so often with complexity and sensitivity to the wealth that comes from diversity," Ms. Andraos wrote. "While this tradition has been upheld through the G.S.A.'s Design Excellence program up until recently, clearly this period might be coming to an end."
The effort to rewrite the Guiding Principles for Federal Architecture is considered among the most egregious features of the order. The principles, part of 1962 document by Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the New York senator, who as a Kennedy administration official was heavily involved in design issues in the capital, have endured for over half a century, in part because they discouraged promoting an official style: "The design must flow from the architectural profession to the government. And not vice versa."
The administration's draft order, which was obtained by The New York Times, suggests an abrupt reversal of that ethos: "Classical and traditional architectural styles have proven their ability to inspire such respect for our system of self-government. Their use should be encouraged."
The proposed mandate has triggered protests from architects and critics of the administration who say the president should not have the ability to issue a top-down mandate on how government buildings should look. News of the draft first appeared in the Architectural Record.
Asked about the possibility of an executive order, Judd Deere, a White House spokesman, declined to comment.
Architects have regarded Mr. Trump, a former real estate developer who keeps close watch over his family's portfolio of luxury properties, with a certain degree of wariness since he took office. His design style at his personal properties favors gilded furniture, marble flooring, and Louis XIV-style flourishes. But two of his higher-profile business projects, including the Trump Towers at Columbus Circle in New York City and The Trump Tower in Chicago, were built with modernist influences.
"At one level, it's aspirational, meant to project the wealth so many citizens can only dream of," the author Peter York wrote in 2017 of Mr. Trump's style. "The best aesthetic descriptor of Trump's look, I'd argue, is dictator style."
Shortly after Mr. Trump's election, the American Institute of Architects pledged to work with him on proposed infrastructure projects, before abruptly withdrawing that pledge after encountering a backlash.
This week, Sarah Dodge, the group's senior vice president of advocacy and relationships, sent a message to group members urging them to sign a petition that would discourage Mr. Trump from signing the order.
"All architectural styles have value and all communities have the right to weigh in on the government buildings meant to serve them," she wrote. The group also issued a statement that "opposes uniform style mandates" for federal architecture.
"Architecture should be designed for the specific communities that it serves," the statement read, "reflecting our rich nation's diverse places, thought, culture and climates."
But Mr. Smith, the chairman of the National Civic Art Society, believes contemporary architecture has "created a built environment that is degraded and dehumanizing." He defended the order by saying Americans are in support of classical style, and that it wasn't calling for a "rigid neo-Classical program."
The group crafted the order a year ago and then spent months prodding several senior administration officials, including Joe Grogan, the White House head of the Domestic Policy Council, people involved in the planning said.
The organization is stocked with experts who believe it is their mission to restore classical design style as the default in American architecture. Justin Shubow, the group's president, was appointed to the United States Commission of Fine Arts, which bills itself as the aesthetic guardian of Washington, D.C., in 2018.
As the order works its way closer to the president's desk, the prevailing thought among architects is that Mr. Trump's approval of one school of architectural thought over another would create a dangerous and even cynical precedent for architects contemplating the aesthetic future of the capitol.
"We are a society that is linked to openness of thought, to looking forward with optimism and confidence at a world that is always in the process of becoming," Thom Mayne, a California architect and Pritzker Prize winner whose Santa Monica firm has designed a number of buildings for the G.S.A., said in an email. "Architecture's obligation is to maintain this forward thinking stance."

Texto completo: Regulators unexpectedly banned broker fees for renters, which in the city have long amounted to as much as 15 percent of the annual lease.
In New York City's intensely competitive rental market, tenants usually deal with middlemen known as brokers, who have near absolute control over apartment listings, viewing appointments and leases.
In return, brokers collect fees that can be as much as 15 percent of the annual lease, typically paid in one lump sum by tenants before they can move in.
But late on Tuesday, New York State effectively eliminated them.
In an unexpected addendum to last year's rent laws, state regulators said renters can no longer be charged broker fees, potentially upending the market and delivering the latest blow to an industry already reeling from new regulations and sweeping tenant protections.
New York is one of the few cities in the country with a broker industry that has such financial leverage over how people rent apartments.
And the elimination of broker fees, in addition to the laws passed last year, pushes New York further as a national leader in creating rules favorable toward renters.
Brokers can still collect a fee, the state said in the revised rules, but it must be paid by the landlord unless a prospective tenant hired them to help find an apartment.
The new rule, buried in a legal guidance on last year's rent laws, caught lawmakers, many landlords and brokers off guard. The Real Estate Board of New York, the influential trade group, immediately threatened to challenge the rule in court and urged its members to protest.
"This is a dire issue with our members, so we are literally going through every single avenue," said Reggie Thomas, the board's senior vice president for government affairs. "It's an all-hands on deck thing because this came out of left field."
Brokers warned that the new rules would simply increase what tenants pay in monthly rent, since many landlords will likely pass on the cost of a broker's fee to their residents in higher rent.
"What was the intended purpose of this?" said Jared Antin, director of sales at Elegran. "If it's to minimize the cost to the tenant, it just changes when the cost is due. Instead of upfront, they will pay it monthly."
But state laws limit how much rents can be raised in New York City's roughly 1 million rent-regulated apartments. There are more than 900,000 market-rate apartments that are not regulated.
Tenant advocates cheered the new broker fee rule, saying it helps tilt an uneven real estate playing field.
"These are important tenant protections and it's about time we had them," said Michael McKee, treasurer of the Tenants PAC. "Real estate brokers have been able to get away with a lot for a long time so it's about time they got reined in."
Newcomers to New York City have long been mystified and frustrated about having to pay a broker's fee even when they found an apartment online. But unlike most cities in the United States, landlords often choose not to work directly with renters or market their units on their own. Instead, they hire a broker.
For months, real estate insiders had privately feared this particular interpretation of the new rent laws, which emboldened Democratic lawmakers passed last year after regaining control of the Legislature for the first time in a decade.
The new laws, aimed at protecting tenants and strengthening rent regulations, said that tenants could be charged no more than $ 20 in fees when applying for an apartment, including background and credit checks. The rent laws passed in June also capped security deposits at one-month's rent, further diminishing the lump sum amount renters typically must pay before being given keys to an apartment.
It was unclear from the language, however, whether that $ 20 cap also applied to broker fees or whether it was lawmakers' intent to abolish the practice of tenants paying broker fees. For a $ 2,500 per month apartment, a broker could collect up to $ 4,500 in a one-time payment based on a 15 percent fee.
In its most recent guidance, however, state regulators clarified that the cap did indeed apply to broker fees, effectively banning the practice.
Now, the burden falls on landlords to pay brokers their fees or they can choose to list, market and lease their units on their own. The changes could effectively turn New York's rental market into a no-fee market if renters choose to hunt for an apartment without hiring a broker themselves.
It was the latest in a long string of recent defeats for New York's real estate industry, which has seen its power diminished after years of allying itself with Republicans when they were in control in Albany.
"This one is just like salt in the wounds," said Jay Martin, the executive director of the Community Housing Improvement Program, a trade association representing about 4,000 building owners. "It's going to decimate the brokerage industry."
Mr. Martin said the prohibition would disproportionately affect small building owners, who typically outsource the work of showing apartments and finding tenants to real estate brokers.
Given New York City's exorbitant rents, broker fees have become the target of progressive lawmakers seeking to curb housing costs. Last year, for example, Councilman Keith Powers introduced a bill to cap broker fees at one-month's rent.
Some tenant activists rejoiced the new guidance, saying it would help reduce the barriers for housing for many tenants and potentially reduce New York's growing homeless population.
"It's about rehousing 92,000 homeless people," said Cea Weaver, the campaign coordinator of Housing Justice for All, a statewide coalition of tenants that pushed for the new rent laws. "Hopefully, it'll make it easier for people being pushed from substandard housing to substandard housing."
Still, Ms. Weaver said that she was skeptical the real estate industry would abide by the new guidance, which is subject to change. The best way to protect tenants, she said, was if state lawmakers passed a good cause eviction bill that would make it even harder for landlords to raise rents and evict tenants.
For market-rate apartments, the cost of broker fees could still trickle down, but it might be impossible to pass on the costs to tenants of rent-regulated units. Increases on those rents are set by the government.
About 2.4 million people live in rent-regulated apartments in New York City.
Most significantly Mr. Martin said, the changes could lead thousands of real estate brokers to lose their jobs.
"I don't think it's hyperbole to say that," Mr. Martin said.
There were more than 25,000 licensed real estate brokers in New York City as of early 2019, according to New York's Department of State.
Eric Benaim, the chief executive of Modern Spaces, a brokerage firm with about 100 employees, said that the changes hurt agents, who make a living based on collecting broker's fees.
"They are just on this high," Mr. Benaim said, "of just punishing real estate and those in the business."

Texto completo: The dispute over the outcome of September's presidential race is playing out while sensitive peace talks take place between the U.S. and the Taliban.
KABUL, Afghanistan -- More than four months after Afghans cast their votes for a new president amid a raging war, the crisis over the election's results deepened as officials on Wednesday ordered a partial audit of a decisive share of ballots.
Despite cries from opposition candidates of irregularities in the September vote, the country's election commission in December declared the incumbent president Ashraf Ghani in the lead, with a margin of less than 1 percent over the minimum 50 percent required for victory.
The opposition tickets, disputing roughly 15 percent of the total vote count, appealed to the Independent Electoral Complaints Commission, which adjudicates candidate objections before a final result is announced.
After weeks of sifting through more than 20,000 complaints, the panel on Wednesday ordered a partial audit of nearly 240,000 votes from the roughly 1.8 million votes cast, essentially keeping the final results hanging in the balance.
Many analysts fear that the crisis over the vote could stretch for weeks, because the audit will be carried out by the same election commission that opposition candidates had accused of mismanagement and of favoring Mr. Ghani.
Mr. Ghani's supporters, in return, accuse the opposition of playing an obstruction game, challenging his victory so they can get a share in the government.
The political crisis continues amid sensitive peace negotiations to end the long war in Afghanistan. Taliban officials and American negotiators have been meeting for weeks trying to finalize a peace deal that was torpedoed by President Trump last September just as the two sides were ready to sign.
The United States is demanding that the Taliban significantly reduce its attacks before the two sides make their agreement final. A deal between Washington and the Taliban, which would also involve the gradual withdrawal of the remaining American troops, would open the way for negotiations between the insurgents and other Afghans, including Mr. Ghani's government, over power sharing.
President Trump has made no secret of his desire to significantly reduce the American troop presence in Afghanistan -- whether there is a peace deal or not. In his State of the Union speech, he said peace talks were continuing and reiterated his desire to end the war.
"We are working to finally end America's longest war and bring our troops back home," Mr. Trump said.
Sayed Qutbuddin Roydar, a member of the election complaints commission, said the panel decided to partially audit disputed categories that add up to about 240,000 votes after a long period of deliberation.
"The election commission says the votes are legitimate, and the complainers are saying no -- the votes are not legitimate," Mr. Roydar said. "We have doubts about the election commission's decisions -- and to consider those votes valid, we have imposed these conditions and ordered the audit so we can convince the complainers and assure ourselves."
While some analysts welcomed the panel's diligence in requiring more information before making a decision on a slice of votes that could decide the election, others said the process had dragged so long it was becoming a joke.
"Nowhere have we seen results take this long," said Mohammad Naeem Ayubzada, head of the Transparent Election Foundation of Afghanistan, a civil society organization. "In Afghanistan, unfortunately, the technical aspects of the election have also become tools for political agendas -- and that means people no longer have faith."

Texto completo: Soldiers, village guards, firefighters and civilians were among those looking for survivors of one avalanche when they were buried by a second.
As rescuers searched for survivors of a deadly avalanche in eastern Turkey, a second avalanche swept down the same slope on Wednesday, killing more than 30 people and injuring many more.
The confirmed toll from the two slides in a mountainous area of Van Province climbed sharply through the day, reaching 38 dead, including 33 rescuers, and 53 injured, according to the national disaster management agency. Officials estimated that two people were still trapped under an earth digger.
The Turkish interior minister, Suleyman Soylu, said officials had called off the rescue work because of intense snowfall and the risk of another avalanche.
The first avalanche, on Tuesday, barreled into a passenger van, knocking it off a road and down a steep slope, killing at least five of the 14 people inside, local news reports said.
Officials estimated that 200 to 300 people were searching on Wednesday morning for victims still buried under the snow when the other avalanche struck. The victims included soldiers, village guards, firefighters and civilians who had joined the rescue efforts, said Mehmet Emin Bilmez, the governor of Van Province.
"I heard a noise, and then half of my body was under the snow," Osman Ucar, the head of the emergency management agency for Van province, told reporters from his hospital bed. "Another earth digger was working up there and it dragged us."
Mr. Ucar was one of about 30 survivors pulled from the snow, as was Gulsen Orhan, an adviser to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and a former lawmaker. Mr. Ucar said organizers had told civilian volunteers to stay higher up the slope, while he and professional emergency workers clambered downhill to the van.
"If the civilians were down there, the consequences might be worse," he said.
Some of those found alive were under as much as 16 feet of snow, said Mr. Soylu. Television broadcasts showed survivors, some struggling to walk, in the arms of their rescuers, along with overturned vehicles, including a snow plow.
The footage showed rescue teams scrambling over the snow and debris amid heavy snowfall and high winds, prodding and digging with sticks and shovels -- the only tools that could be used safely, Mr. Soylu said.
He added that it was not clear how many people were missing because officials did not know how many civilians had joined the rescue effort.
More than 150 rescue workers and temporary cellular phone towers were deployed on Wednesday to the region, which is known for rough winter conditions, the emergency management agency said, in addition to the resources already there.
The weather forecast predicted continued heavy snow, increasing the risk of more avalanches.

Texto completo: Solid economic reports and corporate earnings bolstered equity and commodity markets.
A third straight day of gains on Wall Street on Wednesday raised stocks to a record, as investors took comfort in signs that the American economy was on solid footing despite risks tied to the spread of the coronavirus both inside and outside China.
The new high is the latest show of resilience from a market that over the last month has shrugged-off the threat of war with Iran, the impeachment trial of President Trump and, most recently, the outbreak of a fast-spreading virus that has upended one of the world's largest economies.
Worried that efforts to contain the virus would dampen growth in China and elsewhere, traders had battered stock prices last week. But this week, some of the panic seems to have dissipated and shares in the United States and overseas have mostly rallied.
"It's fear versus greed," said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers in Greenwich, Conn. "Last week was fear, and this week is greed."
The S&P 500 rose 1.1 percent on Wednesday, led by a surge in the shares of energy stocks. Oil prices, which had fallen by more than 20 percent in less than a month, rebounded with prices for a barrel of West Texas Intermediate, a benchmark in oil pricing, rising more than 2 percent.
Prices for copper and iron ore -- key raw materials for the Chinese industrial economy -- also jumped, suggesting growing optimism for the outlook on the global economy.
Some attributed the rosy outlook among investors to unconfirmed reports of promising research at a Chinese university, in which some drugs had appeared to limit the spread of the virus in some experiments.
The World Health Organization played down those reports, but shares rose in Asia anyway. The CSI 300 in China rose 1.1 percent on Wednesday. In Japan, the Nikkei 225 climbed 1 percent. And the Hang Seng in Hong Kong rose 0.4 percent.
One factor behind this week's rally is the effort made by the People's Bank of China to bolster the country's economy by pouring billions into financial markets. The expectation among investors that central bankers outside Beijing will take similar steps could also be fueling the rebound.
Such actions -- which are typically viewed as supportive of risky assets such as stocks -- are commonly referred to as a "put" from central banks, and they have been a key driver in the nearly 11-year-old bull market for stocks.

The Federal Reserve's three rate cuts and the expansion of the central bank's balance sheet -- a byproduct of efforts to raise the level of bank reserves -- were widely seen as a reason for a 28.9 percent rise in the stock market in 2019.
Investors seem to be betting that even if the coronavirus weighs on growth, central banks will prop markets up with further rate cuts and capital injections.
"There seems to be a belief that you have this global central banking put, and it is just stronger than it has been over the past few years," said Yousef Abbasi, global market strategist at INTL FCStone, a financial services and brokerage firm. "Otherwise, this sharp bounce back we've experienced in stocks, essentially to all-time highs, is tough to wrap your head around."
Some analysts have suggested that the market's rebound may reflect increased expectations that Mr. Trump -- who is likely to be acquitted of impeachment charges in the Senate on Wednesday -- will win re-election, after the Democratic caucuses in Iowa on Monday spiraled into an inconclusive debacle.
"Basically Iowa turned out to be a nonevent except for being a black eye for the Democratic Party," Mr. Sosnick said. "The market generally is positive about that."
China's economy has likely stalled in the face of the outbreak, but recent reports have shown -- at least before the outbreak -- the American economy was relatively healthy.
On Wednesday, a key reading on the large American service sector showed it continued to grow in January. A separate report on private sector job growth also showed a bigger-than-expected increase. The report, from payroll processor ADP, is a precursor to the monthly release of employment data -- due out on Friday -- but is not considered to be strongly correlated with that data.
Many companies have hinted about potential disruptions related to the coronavirus, but the actual profit numbers for the fourth quarter have been solid. Roughly 70 percent of the S&P 500 companies that have reported quarterly results so far have beaten expectations from Wall Street analysts.
The smell of profits has whet the appetite for stocks among investors, after markets dropped in late January. From Jan. 20 to the end of the month, a sell-off stemming from the coronavirus wiped out the 3 percent gain the market had notched through the first few weeks of 2020.
Now the market has recouped all of those losses, with the S&P 500 more than 3 percent higher in 2020. The Nasdaq composite has produced even stronger gains, with the tech-heavy index up more than 5 percent so far this year.
The trading day was not a winner for all investors. Shares of Tesla plummeted 17 percent, reversing much of a remarkable rally that sent the stock soaring in recent days.

Texto completo: After the State of the Union address, it's fair to say that the traditions of Washington are over.
This Town is busted.
That's my main thought after last night's State of the Union address.
Traditionally, the State of the Union was a time for a president to address the nation, lay out a policy agenda and maybe even offer a bipartisan olive branch -- payroll tax cuts or infrastructure spending or some kind of legislation that both parties can work together to accomplish.
Instead, on Tuesday evening, Americans witnessed an event that was half MAGA rally and half #Resistance protest, wrapped in a reality TV drama.
Presidents often use their address in a campaign year to make the case for their re-election. And I'm certainly not one who believes that a "bourbon summit" would cure a divided Capitol, ushering an era of interparty cooperation.
But after last night, I think it's fair to say that the traditions of Washington -- musty things like respect, shame and yes, governing -- are over.
Rather than being chastened by impeachment proceedings, Mr. Trump was emboldened. The speech took on the air of a political rally. As Mr. Trump entered, Republicans in the chamber chanted "four more years." When he awarded the conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh the Presidential Medal of Freedom -- on the spot! -- they stood up and cheered, "Thank you, Rush!"
Mr. Trump's critics also made their feelings clear. Fred Guttenberg, the father of a victim of the 2018 Parkland, Fla., high school shooting who came as one of Speaker Nancy Pelosi's guests, was escorted out of the chamber after shouting at the president during a section of the speech on gun rights. As Mr. Trump spoke, some Democratic lawmakers -- those who didn't boycott the speech to begin with -- walked out.
This was a Base First speech for Mr. Trump. Yes, he made attempts to shave down Democratic margins among black voters and suburban women, like when he awarded a young black girl a scholarship. But mostly Mr. Trump focused on rallying his dyed-in-the-wool supporters -- much as he is likely to do in his general election campaign.
The president made sure all parts of the Republican Party got their due. A discussion of the strong economy for fiscal conservatives. Talk of prayer and abortion for social conservatives. And a reminder of the killing of a top Iranian military commander for the hawks who appreciate his aggressive foreign policy.
He opened with some strong economic statistics, praising the "great American comeback" and claiming to have "shattered the mentality of American decline." That framing isn't accurate: Mr. Trump is building on an economic rebound started under his predecessor, President Barack Obama. But it's clear the narrative of Mr. Trump's campaign will be that of saving the country from imminent economic collapse.
And then, there were the references to the "S word" -- socialism -- in a rallying cry for Republicans, who would be delighted if Mr. Trump ran against Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, a self-described democratic socialist, and a Democratic Party that has shifted to the left.
"Socialism destroys nations," Mr. Trump said, after introducing Juan Guaidó, the Venezuelan opposition leader who was one of his guests. "But always remember: Freedom unifies the soul."
Partisan rage, meanwhile, divided the Capitol.
Before his remarks, Mr. Trump declined to shake Ms. Pelosi's hand. When he was done speaking, Ms. Pelosi ostentatiously ripped up her copy of his speech. "It was the courteous thing to do, considering the alternative," she told reporters.
Voters take cues from their leaders. Let's hope that come November, this country isn't left in tatters, too.

The week in impeachment: Trump acquitted
Nearly five months after it began, the impeachment of President Trump came to an end this afternoon. For one last time, my colleagues from The Times's Impeachment Briefing newsletter have volunteered to catch us up on what happened this week.
Mr. Trump was acquitted of both articles of impeachment. In the end, the Senate vote fell far short of the two-thirds majority needed to remove the president from office. The first charge, abuse of power, failed on a vote of 48 to 52, with Senator Mitt Romney, a Republican, crossing party lines to support Mr. Trump's removal. On the second charge, obstruction of Congress, the vote was 47 to 53. No Democrats voted to acquit Mr. Trump.
Mr. Romney predicted he would face "enormous consequences." With his pronouncement of "guilty" on the Senate floor this afternoon, Mr. Romney became the first senator in American history to vote to convict a president from his own party. "I believe that attempting to corrupt an election to maintain power is about as egregious an assault on the Constitution as can be made," he said in an interview with The New York Times this morning. But he expected his vote to come at a cost, and indeed, shortly after the decision was made public, Donald Trump Jr. called for Mr. Romney to be "expelled" from the Republican Party.
So that's it? Impeachment is over? Yes, more or less. Representative Jerrold Nadler, the Democratic chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, said he would still "likely" subpoena testimony from John Bolton, the former national security adviser, though it could provoke an extended legal fight with the White House. And while some senators had discussed the possibility of censuring Mr. Trump, the idea has faded.
... Seriously
Tim Murtaugh, the Trump campaign's communications director, tweeted a photo of Trump surrogates flying back from campaigning in Iowa (click to see the full shot). Now that's coordination.

Texto completo: Readers both praise and criticize the president's speech and the speaker's action when it was over.
To the Editor:
Re "Emboldened Trump Makes 2020 Case" (front page, Feb. 5):
The state of our union is divided. Half the country believes, as the founders did, that virtue and character matter profoundly in the office of the president and that Donald Trump's pressuring a foreign government to dig up dirt on his political opponent was an egregious abuse of power. The other half shrugs their shoulders and wants to move on.
In this vein, the president's State of the Union address did nothing to bridge the divide. It resembled a political rally, with Mr. Trump lying about the economic recovery he was handed by President Obama and lying about wanting to protect the health care of Americans with pre-existing conditions when his administration is in court trying to take those protections away by dismantling Obamacare.
The president's supporters cheered him on. But that wasn't enough. Mr. Trump went so far as to award the Presidential Medal of Freedom to a divisive figure -- Rush Limbaugh -- who has spent his career encouraging hate of the "other." The State of the Union address is an improper venue for such a controversial act.
But this is where we are. Sadly, the state of our union cannot be strong and hopelessly divided at the same time. Surely we can do better.

To the Editor:
In tearing up her copy of the State of the Union speech before the cameras, Nancy Pelosi embarrassed us all by sinking to President Trump's level of childish, vindictive behavior. The speech was, indeed, full of half truths and outright lies. Mr. Trump has damaged the nation's DNA with regard to truth and honor, like a virus gone amok. But let's not descend to even quietly controlled tantrums; rather, let's vote this tyrant out of office in November.

To the Editor:
Nancy Pelosi tore up President Trump's State of the Union speech just as Mr. Trump is tearing up our Constitution.
Good for her!
Susan Wellek

To the Editor:
After spending three angry years attempting to tear down the Trump presidency, the Democratic Party had to settle for tearing up his written words by the petty and fuming Nancy Pelosi.
From the Mueller report hitting the floor with a thud through the litany of impeachable offenses they struggled to come up with, the Democratic Party exhibited its growing incompetency to offer anything other than rage and indignation.
While the president recited his formidable successes for all America in his State of the Union address, the Democrats have their Iowa caucuses to offer in rebuttal.
Larry Volkening

To the Editor:
More and more, in talking with my friends, I hear the constant refrain, "I don't want to live like this anymore!" In short, we are suffering collectively from deep bouts of depression.
The most recent State of the Union by a deeply disturbed person only adds to the feelings of hopelessness and despair. One cannot stand the constant, never-ending bombardment of lies, and the bizarre antics of the president and his Republican cronies. It's too much to bear.
Having lived through Watergate, the Clinton impeachment, Vietnam, the McCarthy hearings, etc., I can say without any hesitation that this is the worst in my nearly 82 years. I fear for this country as never before. It doesn't help in the slightest to say that we've survived bad times before when one feels that this is worse than anything that's happened, at least in my lifetime.
Is there any hope that we can recover from this never-ending nightmare? The prospect of four more years sends me deeper and deeper into further depression.
Ian I. Mitroff
Berkeley, Calif.
To the Editor:
As a native of Venezuela, I saw two things when Juan Guaidó, the leader of the opposition against President Nicolás Maduro, was recognized by President Trump with a bipartisan standing ovation:
Venezuelan democracy has a chance. There are now many Venezuelans who can have hope for clean, democratic elections, not rigged elections with the taste of narco-terrorism. It made me feel great.
However, the second thing I saw was creepy. Venezuela and Juan Guaidó were mere re-election campaign tools for Mr. Trump. He implied ("Socialism destroys nations") that the Democratic Party and Mr. Maduro are the same.
Mr. Trump's support for Venezuela's democracy is just a campaign strategy to fight Democrats and to get the South Florida Venezuelan-American vote. Well, he failed to get mine.
I will grant that Mr. Trump may have a genuine interest in Venezuela: the oil. I do believe in his love for oil.

WrestleMania Drama, 'Survivor'-Level Twists And a Rip for the Ages

Texto completo: The president's speech was jammed with engineered moments and sweeps stunts -- and then came a cable-drama rip.
It's no secret that Donald Trump, just months before he ran for the job of most powerful man in the world, was hosting Season 7 of "The Celebrity Apprentice." But not all his TV appearances as president have been as reality-fied as one might have expected, especially his sedate, from-the-TelePrompTer State of the Union speeches.
The TV president made up for that Tuesday night with a dumbfounding, stunt-laden spectacle, less a presidential address than an "Apprentice" finale wrapped in an Oprah episode stuffed inside a viral YouTube video and dropped into the middle of a WrestleMania match.
The speech was jammed with more twists and giveaways than a two-hour "Survivor" finale. President Trump awarded a young girl in the audience a scholarship. He had his wife, Melania, drape a Presidential Medal of Freedom around the paleoconservative shock jock Rush Limbaugh. He arranged a reunion between a deployed soldier and his wife, just like the surprise-military-return videos that TV morning shows love.
And all these planned moments may have been overshadowed by a drama-filled, two-part installment of "The Real Politicians of D.C.," co-starring his antagonist Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the House. Before he began his speech, he appeared to refuse her offer of a handshake; after he finished, she ripped up her copy of it on camera.
Neither of them, it seems, came there to make friends.
For the president, the address had obvious political goals, coming amid the impeachment trial and at the beginning of an election year. But it also seemed built to make noise and get lasting attention amid a crazy-busy political news week.
A State of the Union address, even in calmer times, is an evanescent thing. A president strikes a temporary tone, rattles off some aspirational proposals that will probably never materialize and the press polishes it off by noon the next day.
This time, unusually, President Trump found himself sandwiched, like a network public-service announcement, into the space between two bigger political stories.
Since Monday night, network news crews had been searching the haunted cornfield into which the results of the Iowa Democratic caucus had vanished. Hours before the speech, when cable analysts would normally be predigesting State of the Union nuggets, CNN's John King and MSNBC's Steve Kornacki were speed-swiping through a belated dump of caucus data.
And the day after his address, the president had an appointment with predestination, as the Senate was scheduled for a Wednesday vote that would, barring shocking news or mass hypnosis, acquit him on impeachment charges.
Indeed, if you've been following the impeachment saga, the State of the Union was like Washington's most ambitious crossover event, with not only the senator-jurors present but also Chief Justice John Roberts (whom Mr. Trump chatted up on his way down the aisle) and figures mentioned in the testimony, like Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.
The president, however tempted, never mentioned impeachment. Instead, he began with a long string of economic statistics and boasts. Congressional Republicans rose and clapped, sat, rose and clapped again, sentence after sentence, a P90X workout of election-year fealty. (They set a raucous tone early, chanting "Four more years!" in case you weren't clear on the subtext.)
For well over an hour, Mr. Trump offered a preview of his re-election argument, a long list of superlatives followed by an effort to soften his image for swing voters, followed by rehardening it for his base.
Several times, he spotlighted Americans of color as his guests -- the scholarship winner, an elderly former Tuskegee Airman whom he had promoted to brigadier general -- continuing an effort to broaden his appeal to minorities, or at least reassure white voters turned off by the demonizing of Mexicans, the insults of Haiti and Africa and the caging of Latin American children at the border.
All this followed a Super Bowl campaign ad featuring an African-American woman that focused on criminal justice reform instead of appealing to his base -- which not long ago he stoked with attacks on black football players who knelt in protest during the national anthem.
The speech also took sharp turns from sentimental to ominous, like the negative part of a campaign ad where the music turns scary and the screen shades to black and white. The president continued a long-running theme of connecting immigrants and violent crime, deploring sanctuary city policies for releasing "dangerous criminal aliens." (Studies in fact show that immigrants commit crime at a lower rate than native-born Americans.)
Over all, this was oddly both the most and the least traditional State of the Union President Trump has given, a comfortable, familiar list of campaign arguments that then veered into sweeps-month theatrics. It took the decades-long tradition of presidential guest stars, which began when Ronald Reagan invited the hero of a plane crash in 1982, and amped it up for the age of reality TV.
The production seemed designed in part to remind Americans of the munificent Donald Trump persona molded by Mark Burnett on "The Apprentice" for a decade. On that show, he was not just the tough-talking "you're fired" guy, but a dispenser of treats, rewards and mercy, who presided over celebrity challenges for charity and swept contestants off for trips to Mar-a-Lago and rides in his personal helicopter, like a pinstriped Santa.
We can wonder what Mr. Trump's presidency would have been like if he had leaned into that side of his TV character from the beginning, rather than the shark from the "Apprentice" boardroom who fomented conflict, browbeat losers and relished fights. He certainly seemed more comfortable Tuesday in the mode of expansive, backslapping master of ceremonies than he ever has reciting his staffers' text from the prompter.
But now, every stage-managed segment arrives in a context. His overtures to minority Americans come with his presidential history on race. Mr. Trump knows how this works; once upon a time, "The Apprentice" had a higher Q Score popularity rating with Hispanic and African-American than white audiences -- until he embraced the birther conspiracy against Barack Obama, whose legacy his address also worked hard to undermine.
In a way, the structure of this State of the Union was a battle against context. It didn't construct a sweeping arc so much as try to generate clips to use online, in ads, on Fox News. Like much of President Trump's rhetoric, it was more movie trailer than movie, a series of blowups each of which sought to Etch-a-Sketch the memory of the last.
But it may have itself been Etch-a-Sketched. It's possible that nothing in the speech will get more attention than the Great Pelosi Rip, custom-made to be transmuted into memes and draw cheers and jeers from partisans and inspire arguments among the agonizing-over-civility class.
This is America's political style now, a product of the Trump administration as visible as a segment of border wall. Donald Trump argued that he has delivered America a lot of things -- and one of them, as the speech ratified, was the transformation of the presidency and public life into a 24-hour reality show.
Tuesday night, he asked the country whether it wanted to renew this production for four more seasons.

Texto completo: About 37 million Americans tuned in on Tuesday, the smallest audience of President Trump's tenure.
President Trump put a "Celebrity Apprentice" spin on his State of the Union address on Tuesday, seeding the 78-minute broadcast with surprise reveals and viral moments: a tear-stained reunion of a military family, a snubbed handshake and an impromptu bestowing of the Presidential Medal of Freedom to a guest star, the radio host Rush Limbaugh.
It was the kind of camera-ready spectacle that can translate into big ratings for afternoon talk-show hosts and prime-time reality shows.
This time, though, the Nielsen numbers did not come through.
Roughly 37.2 million Americans tuned in for Mr. Trump's speech, Nielsen said on Wednesday, the smallest live-TV audience for a presidential address to Congress since Barack Obama's valedictory State of the Union in 2016.
The viewership on Tuesday was a 20 percent decline from Mr. Trump's State of the Union last year, and well below the audience for his speeches in 2017 and 2018.
Why the dip? For one thing, viewers may be feeling a bit overwhelmed.
A Pew survey last fall found that 66 percent of Americans said they were "worn out by the amount of news these days." And those numbers predated Mr. Trump's impeachment, American military conflict in Iran, the president's trial in the Senate and this week's Iowa caucuses -- the outcome of which, as of Wednesday evening, was still in limbo.
Fox News was by far the most-watched network for the speech, drawing 11.5 million viewers, a slight increase from its audience a year ago. MSNBC, which is popular with liberals, fell to last place among the major channels airing the speech, a sign that Mr. Trump's critics may have decided to tune out.
NBC had the largest audience among the Big Three broadcast networks, with 4.8 million viewers. The Nielsen data did not include C-SPAN viewers or those who watched the speech online or via streaming video, meaning that many more Americans likely saw some portion of the address.
During a week of intense political TV, Wednesday brought another dramatic episode: the Senate's afternoon vote on the articles of impeachment.
In a riveting roll call -- imbued with the incantations and solemnity of a church service -- 100 senators, one by one, announced "guilty" or "not guilty" before a national audience.
"It's a pretty dramatic and grave moment, and as far as the political impact, I think you'd have to say that Donald Trump is better off now than he was when this impeachment process began," the anchor Chris Wallace said on Fox News afterward.
On MSNBC, post-acquittal, the mood was melancholic.
"The stain will always be on this presidency," said Eugene Robinson, a political analyst and Washington Post columnist. Claire McCaskill, the former Democratic Missouri senator, commended politically vulnerable Democrats who voted guilty for their "courageous stand," adding, "I'm very proud of them all."
The final vote was preceded by another dose of TV drama, when Senator Mitt Romney, Republican of Utah, revealed that he would vote to convict Mr. Trump on both counts.
Mr. Romney, it emerged, had taped a sit-down with Mr. Wallace on Fox News earlier on Wednesday morning and granted advance interviews about his decision to The Atlantic and The New York Times, among a handful of news outlets. It was a deft public-relations move by Mr. Romney, the former Republican presidential nominee, that apparently caught the White House off guard.
The static, lo-fi images of the Senate floor vote were in stark contrast to the high production values of Mr. Trump's State of the Union, where cameras swooped above the audience and zoomed in on the facial reactions of politicians.
That was because the Republican Senate leadership restricted television coverage of their proceedings to in-house, government-controlled cameras, rather than allowing independent news outlets like C-SPAN to cover the trial.
As for the State of the Union, Nielsen said that social media engagement with the speech peaked just after its conclusion, at 10:31 p.m., when House Speaker Nancy Pelosi tore up her copy of the president's speech in full view of the cameras -- her own contribution to the evening's series of meme-worthy moments.

Texto completo: A murder-mystery series with Rosario Dawson debuts on USA Network. And Edie Falco stars in a new drama series on CBS.
What's on TV
BRIARPATCH 10 p.m. on USA Network. "The thing about homicides, well, most of them are damn simple," a lawman says in the first episode of this new murder-mystery series. "But every now and then, you'll get one that's tricky. Like this one right here." He's talking to Allegra Dill (Rosario Dawson), a powerful government staffer who has returned to her fictional, very surreal Texas hometown to investigate her sister's death. (The sister was blown up by a car bomb.) The killing is at the center of the series, but its heart may lie elsewhere: Andy Greenwald, a former TV critic who wrote the show (it's based on the Ross Thomas novel of the same name), said in an interview with The New York Times last year that he was influenced by shows like "Twin Peaks" and "Lost." "They all had a community of characters who you wanted to spend time with and who you'd get excited about whenever they appeared onscreen," he said. "'Who did it?' is kind of the most boring question you can ask. It seems like the most important question, but it's really just the engine that fuels the deeper dive into the weirder, richer emotional lives of the characters and the community."
KATY KEENE 8 p.m. on the CW. The Archie Comics character Katy Keene ditches the fictional town of Riverdale for the stranger-than-fiction New York City in this new, fashion-forward musical series. A spinoff of "Riverdale," the show reimagines Katy (Lucy Hale) and a few other Archie Comics characters as young New Yorkers chasing their dreams, which include Broadway stardom and fashion-business success.
TOMMY 10 p.m. on CBS. Edie Falco plays a high-ranking New York Police Department officer who ditches New York for Los Angeles in this drama series. Tommy (Falco) has good professional reasons to leave: In the first episode, debuting Thursday, she starts a new gig as Los Angeles's first female chief of police. Given the stakes of the new job -- an early challenge sees her navigating a conflict between the L.A.P.D. and Immigration and Customs Enforcement -- she probably isn't going to have much time to enjoy the weather.
What's Streaming
MISS AMERICANA (2020) Stream on Netflix. Taylor Swift offers a controlled look at her life and creative process in this new documentary, which highlights the loneliness of being one of the biggest pop stars on the planet. "Miss Americana" shows Swift's professional life to be filled with pressure and battles with the patriarchy; it tells the story of an artist maturing both as a creator and as a person. "What's bracing about this film, which Lana Wilson directed, is the way it weds Swift's loneliness and her arrival at empowerment," Wesley Morris wrote in his review for The Times. Morris called it "85 minutes of translucence with Taylor Swift."

Inquiries Into 2020 Candidates Require Barr's Approval

Texto completo: The move is intended to help avoid upending the election as the F.B.I. inadvertently did in 2016 when its campaign inquiries shaped the outcome of the race.
WASHINGTON -- Attorney General William P. Barr issued new restrictions on Wednesday over the opening of politically sensitive investigations, an effort meant to avoid upending the presidential election as the F.B.I. inadvertently did in 2016 when its campaign inquiries shaped the outcome of the race.
The order by Mr. Barr, announced in a memo reviewed by The New York Times, comes after a scathing report by the inspector general that showed how F.B.I. agents did not follow protocols and falsified information in their bid to investigate Carter Page, a former Trump campaign associate.
The memo, which said the Justice Department had a duty to ensure that elections are "free from improper activity or influences," was issued on the same day that President Trump was acquitted on charges that he had abused his office to push a foreign power to publicly announce investigations into his political rivals. The memo said that the F.B.I. and all other divisions under the department's purview must get Mr. Barr's approval before investigating any of the 2020 presidential candidates.
The attorney general has long expressed skepticism about the F.B.I.'s decision to investigate the Trump campaign's ties to Russia in 2016, and he has tapped a top prosecutor to begin a criminal investigation into the origins of that inquiry. He has also criticized the former F.B.I. director James B. Comey for publicly discussing the investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server without approval from Justice Department officials.
"In certain cases, the existence of a federal criminal or counterintelligence investigation, if it becomes known to the public, may have unintended effects on our elections," Mr. Barr wrote.
Those concerns, combined with the inspector general's findings, seemed to underpin Mr. Barr's memo to top Justice Department officials.
While the department must respond "swiftly and decisively" to credible threats to the electoral process, "we also must be sensitive to safeguarding the department's reputation for fairness, neutrality and nonpartisanship," he wrote.
He previewed the new policy at a news conference in January, when he said his approval would be required in future investigations involving presidential candidates or campaigns.
In the memo, Mr. Barr established a series of requirements governing whether investigators could open preliminary or full "politically sensitive" criminal and counterintelligence investigations into candidates or their donors.
No investigation into a presidential or vice-presidential candidate -- or their senior campaign staff or advisers -- can begin without written notification to the Justice Department and the written approval of Mr. Barr.
The F.B.I. must also notify and consult with the relevant leaders at the department -- like the heads of the criminal division, the national security division or a United States attorney's office -- before investigating Senate or House candidates or their campaigns, or opening an inquiry related to "illegal contributions, donations or expenditures by foreign nationals to a presidential or congressional campaign."
Past attorneys general have said that the department must take extra care with politically sensitive campaign-related investigations in an election year. But Mr. Barr is the first to require that the F.B.I. consult with the Justice Department before opening politically charged investigations.
Since he took office, he has handled a seemingly endless series of politically charged investigations and their aftermaths, and he has drawn rebukes for how he has done so.
Mr. Barr faced withering criticism over his delivery of the Mueller report to Congress. While he allowed the report to be made available to the public with only light redactions, Democrats and some centrist Republicans accused him of playing down the severity of the findings.
The attorney general is also overseeing a criminal inquiry into the decision to open the investigation into Mr. Trump's campaign.
Under Mr. Barr's watch, federal prosecutors in Manhattan charged two Soviet-born businessmen -- who were also associates of Mr. Trump's personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani -- with violating campaign finance laws multiple times. And prosecutors in Manhattan are investigating Mr. Giuliani himself for potentially violating foreign influence laws.
In December, Michael E. Horowitz, the Justice Department inspector general, issued a 400-plus page report that found F.B.I. officials engaged in a dysfunctional and error-ridden process as they sought to obtain and renew warrants from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to wiretap Mr. Page.
Those errors -- including material omissions and false or misleading statements in application materials that went to the court -- gave fuel to both Democrats and Republicans who have accused the F.B.I. of overreach or abuse of its authority when it has investigated citizens. Justice Department officials pointed to that report to support worries that Mr. Barr expressed last year that the Trump campaign had been unlawfully or improperly "spied upon."
In his memo, Mr. Barr said that "it is often good practice" to notify the deputy attorney general of any delicate or high-profile investigation and provide that office with regular updates. He also said that the memo should be "broadly construed" to ensure that department leaders knew of any matters that could potentially disrupt the election.
Mr. Barr directed all department divisions and law enforcement agencies to review their existing policies regarding how they work with top Justice Department officials on politically sensitive investigations, and to submit a report by April to the deputy attorney general.
The requirements in the memo are to remain in effect through the 2020 elections. After that, the department will study whether the changes were necessary.

Texto completo: Headnote Learning Black History Year Round
Dorothy Lee Bolden's first experience with domestic work was at the age of 9 where she earned $1.25 per week.
Alabama-bom Bolden (1923-2005), alongside her mother, washed soiled diapers for a white employer. Little did anyone know that this profession would spur Bolden to spearhead the movement for basic dignity and respect for generations of domestic workers.
Domestic work followed Bolden beyond high school. According to sources from the New York Times, Bolden said she would wake "at 4 a.m. to leave home by 6:00 a.m., and be on the job by 8:00 a.m., perform all those duties necessary to the proper management of a household for eight hours, leave there by 4:00 p.m. to be home by 6:00 p.m. where I would do the same things I've done all over again for my own family."
It was Bolden's experiences working as a domestic in 1940s Atlanta that inspired her civil rights activism. A white female employer demanded that Bolden remain beyond her shift and wash dishes. Bolden refused. She was arrested and held in the county jail because "she was crazy." There was no other reason for disobeying an order from a white person.
Bolden was never sentenced or institutionalized, but this event was the seed that grew into an organization that would protect domestic workers across the United States: the National Domestic Workers Union of America.
Rosa Parks had made public transportation a major breeding ground for civil rights activism, so Bolden began organizing during the long bus rides her peers made to wealthy neighborhoods. Many were fed up, working long hours for little pay, with little to no worker protections.
This organization of women would go on to fight for worker's rights, create training programs, and teach workers to advocate for themselves. It was also important to Bolden to teach communication skills.
In the book "Household Workers Unite," Bolden is quoted as saying: "You have to teach each maid how to negotiate. .. And this is the most important thing-communication. I would tell them it was up to them to communicate."
But respect for Bolden's activism was not shared by everyone. Although she consulted presidents Ford, Reagan and Carter, she received several death threats from the Ku Klux Klan.
The New York Times reported that during the makings of an oral history project, Bolden said that "??? claiming to be members of the KKK called her house and spoke about "whipping my behind," but in coarser terms. "I told them any time they wanted to, come on over and grab it," Bolden said during the interview. "It didn't scare me, didn't bother me. It made me angry, it made me determined to do what I had to do."
U.S. Rep. John Lewis of Georgia said that Bolden "spoke up, and she spoke out, and when she saw something that wasn't fair, or just, or right, she would say something."
The NDWU of America lasted until the mid-1990s, but(ProQuest: ... denotes text stops here in original.)

Texto completo: In a most unusual endorsement, the New York Times has endorsed both Senators Elizabeth Warren (MA) and Amy Klobuchar (MN) for the Democratic nomination for President. Apparently, the Editorial Board of the Times disagrees with Senator Ber-nie Sanders (VT), who allegedly told Warren that a woman could not win the Presidency. I'd love to see the right woman in the White House, but I've been among the many who have wondered openly if, in a polarized and sexist United States, a woman can win both the nomination and the Presidency.
Though polls are not a definitive measure of who will win an election, Warren and Klobuchar tend to poll more weakly than the men in the race - Vice President Biden, Sanders, and former Mayor Pete Buttigieg. Have we come such a long way since 2016 that a woman is electable? Can so-called progressive men who want to get 45 out of the White House overcome their gender bias to vote for a woman?
Clearly, the Times not only thinks a woman can win, but in endorsing two women for the Democratic nomination, they are saying that women are the best of the Democrats in the race. And, in the past two years, we've seen signs that women are gaining politically. The women's sweep of the 2018 elections certainly bodes well for women. At the same time, is gender a sufficient qualification for the Presidency? Three years after the first flawed but overwhelmingly successful Women's March in 2017, the realignment of the March "movement" has illustrated cracks in the foundations of feminism.
These flaws perhaps go back to the scuffle over who should get the vote first between our nation's first feminists like Elizabeth Cady Stanton and civil rights activists like Frederick Douglass. In resenting the fact that Black men got the vote before white women, those early feminists used extremely disparaging language against Black men, using terms like "savage" to suggest these men did not deserve to vote.
Can anybody say "intersectionality"? Or to make it more clear, use the words of Sojourner Truth and say, "Ain't I A Woman." The women's march movement fell apart because women were not on the same page. Accusations against Ta-mika Mallory and Linda Sarsour, two of the co-chairs of the March caused much discussion and rancor, so much so that the second Women's March attracted a fraction of the people who showed up to the first one. And the third March was operated on s different model. It did not equal the excitement or momentum of the first March, although there were many more local marches and other activities associated with the marches.
Women can't "come together" unless they acknowledge our differences, as well as our similarities. Thanks to Tarana Burke and folks like Professor Kimberly Crenshaw, some Black women are openly addressing issues of race and class in feminism. But I've heard few white women, either politicians or intellectuals, deal with issues of racism in the women's movement. Is there really "a women's movement"? There are women's issues, and women's marches, and an exhilarating display of anti-Trump sentiment three years ago (don't forget that 53 percent of white women voted for that man), but when do women come together?
In other words, gender is not a qualification for higher office. And if the women endorsed by the New York Times do not fully explore the concept of intersectionality and speak on it, they will likely sideline some votes, even though many others would vote for Bubba the Fool to get rid of 45. Both Warren and Klobuchar are exciting candidates. Warren's progressive ideas endear her to the left, and Klobuchar's more moderate approach to social and economic challenges appeals to others. The Times did a good job of contrasting the two women.
But can either win the Presidency? When then one-term Senator Barack Obama ran for President, 1 liked him very much but didn't think a Black man could succeed in this racist nation. Thankfully, I was wrong. Can a woman win in 2020? I'm hoping the best candidate will win, and the best candidate may well be a woman.

Texto completo: Black women are some of the most amazing females on the planet. There are many fraudulent images and concepts about black women in American culture, where they are considered angry, hard to talk to and unintelligent. The image of black women as a B, gives everyone in the country, the impression that the majority of our women will curse you out, and are always ready to fight.
These inaccurate descriptions of black women give young black girls a negative impression of themselves, their culture and race, especially when they are constantly being bombarded with foolishness on the radio or with reality television, it makes black women appear silly.
But for decades black women have achieved phenomenal accomplishments and achieving the goal of sharing this information requires black media to lead the way, by exposing the truth to America and the world.
Shonda Rhimes, the most powerful show-maker in Hollywood says, "What we are is truth tellers, change agents, and troublemakers - in the best way. We're agitating. And advocating. Standing on the shoulders of a long line of resourceful, and resilient black women. And preparing the next generation to take on the mantle, with their own kind of activism."
Black women have always understood that there was racial discrimination, but they also were discriminated against because of their gender. Black women, and women in general, knew they had to fight and still nurture and take care of their children, and their man. Black women are magicians; they were always working. And today, more women are graduating from college than ever before.
The essence of black women is that they are survivors, with purpose as their common denominator. They take care of business, and they get the job done. "There are also countless women beyond the headlines doing the work every day without any of the fanfare," says Amber Scott of Black Enterprise.
There are always black women like Oprah Winfrey and Michelle Obama, whose contributions are too numerous to count, and who are using their influence to promote other black women. "There is DJ Beverly Bond, who's gathered up the sprinkles of black girl magic to show the world how much black girls do indeed rock," says Amber Scott.
Not only are black women some of the smartest on the planet, they are also the prettiest. In December 2019, black women held five of the biggest beauty pageant titles in the United States and the world. "When Miss Jamaica, Toni-Ann Singh, was crowned Miss World in London, she joined an impressive roster of Black women who hold some of the world's most prestigious pageant titles," says Tara Law of the New York Times.
The prestigious pageant titles were: Toni-Ann Singh as Miss World, Cheslie Kryst as Miss USA, Kaliegh Garris as Miss Teen USA, Zozibi-ni Tunzi as Miss Universe and Nia Franklin as Miss America (who has since crowned her successor on December 19). It is the first time that black women have held all five of these titles at once.
Black women have a troubled history with race, especially when it comes to beauty pageants in America. The wins were very difficult for blacks to get, because racism played a major part in every judge's decision. But black women never gave up, and many of the contestants considered themselves freedom fighters.
In almost every field black women have achieved - and have never stopped fighting. Truth tellers, change agents, and troublemakers, Black women were advocating, agitating to break down the walls. Black women are the most beautiful women on the planet, they are queens, and we must shower them with our love.

It's Buttigieg over Sanders — for now

Texto completo: DES MOINES — Pete Buttigieg had a narrow lead over Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders in the Iowa caucuses in partial results released Tuesday by the state Democratic Party after a chaotic night that put the presidential race in a frustrating limbo while endangering the future of the first-in-the-nation contest.
With data released from 62 percent of the state's precincts, Buttigieg had 26.9 percent of the state delegates awarded by the caucuses. The former mayor of South Bend, Ind., led Sanders, who won 25.1 percent. Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren was third with 18.3 percent and former vice president Joe Biden next at 15.6 percent.
A second batch of results released late Tuesday solidified Buttigieg's lead. With 71 percent of precincts reporting, Sanders was a close second.
The release of only partial figures a day after the full results had been expected led Iowa Democratic Party Chairman Troy Price to “apologize deeply" even as he defended the delay as necessary to make sure that “unacceptable" reporting problems didn't mar the data.
“My number one priority has been on ensuring the accuracy and the integrity of the results and we have been working all night to be in the best position to report results," he told reporters. “The bottom line is we hit a stumbling block on the back end of the reporting of the data but . . . we know this data is accurate."
Party leaders blamed Monday night's problems on glitches with a mobile app developed to make it easier to report results from the nearly 1,700 caucus precincts. People running those caucuses in school gyms, community centers, and places of worship across Iowa said the app failed or forced them to repeatedly log back in.
Calls made to a state Democratic Party caucus hot line Monday night wouldn't go through, with some put on hold for an hour or more.
“Anybody could have foreseen logistical problems in the execution of running the caucuses [this year]," said Chris Liebig, a precinct secretary in Iowa City who has been advocating against the byzantine caucus system since 2004.
He said his experience Monday night proved his point. The app failed before he even had a chance to submit the results from his caucus, which was attended by 875 people. The precinct chair tried calling in the results and was placed on hold for at least 30 minutes before deciding to try again later.
By the time Liebig went home, after 11 p.m., the results still couldn't be submitted.
The app is called Shadow and its website says it was designed by a group of “campaign and technology veterans" who have developed tech for Hillary for America, Obama for America, and Google. It was hastily assembled over the past two months, The New York Times reported, citing people who were briefed on the technology by the state party.
State party officials engaged in heated calls with campaign representatives late into Monday night to explain the delay as some candidates declared success even though official results hadn't been released. The candidates then headed to New Hampshire to campaign for that state's primary on Feb. 11.
Unlike primaries, which are run by state government elections officials, the Iowa caucuses are a private affair run by the state's Democratic and Republican parties.
On Tuesday morning, the Iowa Democratic Party released a statement saying officials had determined the underlying data collected through the app “was sound" and recorded accurately but that the app “was reporting out only partial data" because of a coding error that had been fixed. State party officials said they had the paper-trail to fully corroborate and release partial results later in the day.
Monday night had started out so hopeful as Iowans took their quadrennial turn in the political spotlight. A large field of Democratic candidates had trekked to Iowa for months to stump for votes at such time-honored rituals as the Polk County Steak Fry and the Iowa State Fair, and Democrats around the country were eager for the caucus to deliver the first stamp of “electability" in the search for a nominee to take on President Trump.
Precinct leaders and caucusgoers described an exciting night of the usual one-on-one politicking and debate at sites as voters aligned themselves into groups in support of candidates. Some caucus chairs said Tuesday that caucusgoers had praised them for running well-organized operations. And this year, the party had made serious attempts to open up the process to new and underserved voters, hosting festive caucuses at bilingual sites and mosques in historic firsts.
But the problems started soon after the tallies were counted and many participants had gone home. Precinct leaders said they had trouble toggling through the app and were encountering errors when they tried to upload their results. Several said they could not tell whether a photo of their caucus math sheet had been accepted and believed the issues stemmed mostly from the large volume of submissions, not a flaw in the app.
Others didn't think twice about the issues — until, as Des Moines County Democratic Chair Tom Courtney and other caucus leaders put it — “the mess" unfolded into delays and confusion.
“I thought it was not a big deal, and later I found out it was a very big deal," said Steve Drahozal, a Democratic Party chairman in Dubuque County who met with several precinct leaders Monday night and swapped stories of trying to report their troubles to the state party hot line. “The main thing I was hearing was that people were on the phone anywhere from 30 minutes to 40 to 45 to 50, and at an hour the call would drop."
Precinct leaders on Tuesday marveled at the irony of how an app meant to make their life easier did just the opposite.
Danielle Benford, a precinct captain in Coralville, said she was able to submit her precinct's results on the app but not without some technical difficulties. The app also made her log back in every time she toggled out of it to use her phone timer or access a different app, which slowed the process.
“It made it a little more difficult, but I understand the reason for it, just trying to be extra secure," said Benford, who oversaw a caucus of 228 people. “I think when you're trying to be more transparent in your process, it's going to take more time to go through things as well."
This year's process might have taken longer than in years past because precincts were required to keep more detailed paper trails under new rules that were meant to speed up the caucusing, increase its transparency, and make it more inclusive. Iowa's Democratic Party implemented the changes this year after complaints by supporters of Sanders of irregularities in the 2016 caucuses, which he narrowly lost.
Iowans are defensive about their first-in-the-nation caucuses and take the responsibility seriously, so seriously that this year Democrats felt anxious over their weighty decision in a volatile contest with so many candidates and no clear front-runner, as well as an urgency to beat Trump.
But Monday's problems once more ignited debate about whether the state should hold such a coveted slot on the election calendar. Even before the problems, the Iowa caucuses had been heavily criticized as too rural, too white, and too long for many to participate.
“Voting should not be a three-hour-long ordeal for people," Liebig, the precinct chair in Iowa City. “They wanted to report the actual vote counts, which is nice, but as a result, the system basically required a couple thousand precinct chairs to follow very detailed instructions while they're trying to herd dozens or hundreds of people."
Greg Shill, a first-time caucusgoer and law professor at the University of Iowa, didn't personally witness any problems, but he said he was disappointed in how the night seemed to devolve into chaos.
“If [the results] end up being 24 hours later than expected, I don't think it's the end of the world, and I don't think it should shake up the race," said Shill, who joined a caucus of more than 500 people at the University of Iowa in Iowa City. “But there has been a lot of valid criticism of the caucus for some time, and I don't think this is helping Iowa's case for going first in the future."

Avalanche in Turkey kills dozens of rescuers responding to earlier slide

Texto completo: NEW YORK — As rescuers searched for survivors of a deadly avalanche in eastern Turkey, a second avalanche swept down the same slope Wednesday, killing more than 30 people and injuring many more.
The confirmed toll from the two slides in a mountainous area of Van province climbed sharply through the day, reaching 38 dead, including 33 rescuers, and 53 injured, according to the national disaster management agency. Officials estimated that 10 to 15 people were still unaccounted for.
The first avalanche, on Tuesday, barreled into a passenger van, knocking it off a road and down a steep slope, killing at least five of the 14 people inside, local news reports said.
Officials estimated that 200 to 300 people were searching Wednesday morning for victims still buried under the snow when the other avalanche struck. The victims included soldiers, village guards, firefighters, and civilians who had joined the rescue efforts, said Mehmet Emin Bilmez, governor of Van province.
“I heard a noise, and then half of my body was under the snow," Osman Ucar, head of the emergency management agency for Van province, told reporters from his hospital bed. “Another earth digger was working up there and it dragged us."
Ucar was one of about 30 survivors pulled from the snow, as was Gulsen Orhan, an adviser to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and a former lawmaker. Ucar said organizers had told civilian volunteers to stay higher up the slope, while he and professional emergency workers clambered downhill to the van.
“If the civilians were down there, the consequences might be worse," he said.
Some of those found alive were under as much as 16 feet of snow, said Turkish interior minister Suleyman Soylu. Television broadcasts showed survivors, some struggling to walk, in the arms of their rescuers, along with overturned vehicles, including a snow plow.
The footage showed rescue teams scrambling over the snow and debris amid heavy snowfall and high winds, prodding and digging with sticks and shovels — the only tools that could be used safely, Soylu said.
He added that it was not clear how many people were missing because officials did not know how many civilians had joined the rescue effort.
More than 150 rescue workers and temporary cellular phone towers were deployed Wednesday to the region — which is known for rough winter conditions — in addition to the resources already there, the emergency management agency said.
The weather forecast predicted continued heavy snow, increasing the risk of more avalanches.

Party leaders blamed Monday night's problems on glitches with a mobile app developed to make it easier to report results from the nearly 1,700 caucus precincts. People running those caucuses in school gyms, community centers, and places of worship across Iowa said the app failed or forced them to repeatedly log back in.
Calls made to a state Democratic Party caucus hot line Monday night wouldn't go through, with some put on hold for an hour or more.
“Anybody could have foreseen logistical problems in the execution of running the caucuses [this year]," said Chris Liebig, a precinct secretary in Iowa City who has been advocating against the byzantine caucus system since 2004.
He said his experience Monday night proved his point. The app failed before he even had a chance to submit the results from his caucus, which was attended by 875 people. The precinct chair tried calling in the results and was placed on hold for at least 30 minutes before deciding to try again later.
By the time Liebig went home, after 11 p.m., the results still couldn't be submitted.
The app is called Shadow and its website says it was designed by a group of “campaign and technology veterans" who have developed tech for Hillary for America, Obama for America, and Google. It was hastily assembled over the past two months, The New York Times reported, citing people who were briefed on the technology by the state party.
State party officials engaged in heated calls with campaign representatives late into Monday night to explain the delay as some candidates declared success even though official results hadn't been released. The candidates then headed to New Hampshire to campaign for that state's primary on Feb. 11.
Unlike primaries, which are run by state government elections officials, the Iowa caucuses are a private affair run by the state's Democratic and Republican parties.
On Tuesday morning, the Iowa Democratic Party released a statement saying officials had determined the underlying data collected through the app “was sound" and recorded accurately but that the app “was reporting out only partial data" because of a coding error that had been fixed. State party officials said they had the paper-trail to fully corroborate and release partial results later in the day.
Monday night had started out so hopeful as Iowans took their quadrennial turn in the political spotlight. A large field of Democratic candidates had trekked to Iowa for months to stump for votes at such time-honored rituals as the Polk County Steak Fry and the Iowa State Fair, and Democrats around the country were eager for the caucus to deliver the first stamp of “electability" in the search for a nominee to take on President Trump.
Precinct leaders and caucusgoers described an exciting night of the usual one-on-one politicking and debate at caucus sites as voters aligned themselves into groups in support of candidates. Some caucus chairs said Tuesday that caucusgoers had praised them for running well-organized operations. And this year, the party had made serious attempts to open up the process to new and underserved voters, hosting festive caucuses at bilingual sites and mosques in historic firsts.
But the problems started soon after the tallies were counted and many participants had gone home. Precinct leaders said they had trouble toggling through the app and were encountering errors when they tried to upload their results. Several said they could not tell whether a photo of their caucus math sheet had been accepted and believed the issues stemmed mostly from the large volume of submissions, not a flaw in the app.
Others didn't think twice about the issues — until, as Des Moines County Democratic Chair Tom Courtney and other caucus leaders put it — “the mess" unfolded into delays and confusion.
“I thought it was not a big deal, and later I found out it was a very big deal," said Steve Drahozal, a Democratic Party chairman in Dubuque County who met with several precinct leaders Monday night and swapped stories of trying to report their troubles to the state party hot line. “The main thing I was hearing was that people were on the phone anywhere from 30 minutes to 40 to 45 to 50, and at an hour the call would drop."
Precinct leaders on Tuesday marveled at the irony of how an app meant to make their life easier did just the opposite.
Danielle Benford, a precinct captain in Coralville, said she was able to submit her precinct's results on the app but not without some technical difficulties. The app also made her log back in every time she toggled out of it to use her phone timer or access a different app, which slowed the process.
“It made it a little more difficult, but I understand the reason for it, just trying to be extra secure," said Benford, who oversaw a caucus of 228 people. “I think when you're trying to be more transparent in your process, it's going to take more time to go through things as well."
This year's process might have taken longer than in years past because precincts were required to keep more detailed paper trails under new rules that were meant to speed up the caucusing, increase its transparency, and make it more inclusive. Iowa's Democratic Party implemented the changes this year after complaints by supporters of Sanders of irregularities in the 2016 caucuses, which he narrowly lost.
Iowans are defensive about their first-in-the-nation caucuses and take the responsibility seriously, so seriously that this year Democrats felt anxious over their weighty decision in a volatile contest with so many candidates and no clear front-runner, as well as an urgency to beat Trump.
But Monday's problems once more ignited debate about whether the state should hold such a coveted slot on the election calendar. Even before the problems, the Iowa caucuses had been heavily criticized as too rural, too white, and too long for many to participate.
“Voting should not be a three-hour-long ordeal for people," Liebig, the precinct chair in Iowa City. “They wanted to report the actual vote counts, which is nice, but as a result, the system basically required a couple thousand precinct chairs to follow very detailed instructions while they're trying to herd dozens or hundreds of people."
Greg Shill, a first-time caucusgoer and law professor at the University of Iowa College of Law, didn't personally witness any problems, but he said he was disappointed in how the night seemed to devolve into chaos.
“If [the results] end up being 24 hours later than expected, I don't think it's the end of the world, and I don't think it should shake up the race," said Shill, who joined a caucus of more than 500 people at the University of Iowa in Iowa City. “But there has been a lot of valid criticism of the caucus for some time, and I don't think this is helping Iowa's case for going first in the future."

Texto completo: Oh, Iowa, first in the nation, so unlike the rest of the nation yet so influential on the nominating process for president. Until now, perhaps. The meltdown of the Iowa caucus in full glare of the national spotlight should - we believe - end of the tyranny of this nonrepresentative state over our presidential nominating process.Not that Iowa being first has much to do with the failure of the caucuses to achieve clarity in the Democratic race - an apparent failure of a new app designed to tally results led to no one knowing who actually won the caucus on the Democratic side until late Tuesday.
President Donald Trump won the Republican vote and could be said to be the overall winner of the entire night because attention then turned to him. As president, he got to deliver the State of the Union a day after voting in Iowa had stopped.
Iowa is supposed to be good for a bump going into New Hampshire, the second state to vote - another nonrepresentative place - and without a clear, quick winner, there will be no boost, no anointing of the front-runner. In this age of all media, 24/7, the page turns quickly. The State of the Union will dominate headlines today, not who prevailed in Iowa.
The abject misery of Monday night, with vote counts unavailable and the unraveling of TV pundits, underscores the challenges to overcome in making sure people trust the electoral process.
First, it's important to point out that the fact that Iowa could not be counted quickly does not mean its results are suspect. Iowa, thankfully, had a paper backup. The failure does mean the system used was not tested adequately beforehand. The complexity of the caucus system, combined with the new online app, created disaster. Even weak Wi-Fi signals in high school gymnasiums - a sign of poor infrastructure that plagues much of the nation - helped cause delays.
We in New Mexico can sympathize with the mess. In February 2008, our state's attempt to matter in the presidential nominating process ended badly when the final tally between Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton could not be completed for weeks. It was a black eye for New Mexico, just as Iowa is being shamed nationally right now.
Don't forget that in Iowa, caucus gatherings are put together by the respective political parties and a host of volunteers. They have been criticized - rightly, we believe - for their undemocratic nature, but we respect the work that goes into assembling the process.
Iowa caucusing means hours spent debating the various candidates, something that heavily favors the retired, people who can take off from their jobs and others with the freedom to come and go.
Disabled people, folks with small children and no child care and working people who can't take time off are disenfranchised by a system that requires many hours in one physical location. A primary, on the other hand, offers a secret ballot and the ability to vote quickly and return to the business of the day.
Even without the nondemocratic nature of Iowa's system, its population is hardly representative - 91 percent of participants in the Iowa caucuses are white. The state skews older, as well. That makes the electorate unlike both the Democratic Party and the national electorate - the Democratic Party, for example, is 40 percent nonwhite. To give Iowa and New Hampshire, where 93 percent of the voters are white, such influence at the start of the process silences more diverse voices.
Democrats, in particular, need to move to a system of nominating the president that allows more diverse states - think Illinois, Nevada, even New Mexico - to weigh in on the nomination earlier in the process.
If party leaders can't make Iowa and New Hampshire change dates, just ignore them. Writing in the New York Times, Michael Tomasky offered this solution: "Let Iowa and New Hampshire hold their caucus and primary, but don't participate. Make all the candidates agree that they won't seek a spot on the ballot."
A system of regional primaries, with states voting several weeks apart, could even keep Iowa and New Hampshire in the first group while adding a Nevada or a South Carolina to the mix, for example. A Rust Belt state such as Michigan could be worked in the first series of primaries, showing the Democratic Party how the front-runners appeal to blue-collar voters. Heck, put Ohio first. It's a state Democrats usually must win.
Folding Iowa and New Hampshire into earlier primaries - but diversifying the field - could satisfy tradition while recognizing the changing electorate. Bringing in diverse voices early would help Democrats choose a nominee better equipped to appeal to all factions of its big-tent party while demonstrating a clear alternative to an increasingly xenophobic Republican Party. The changing America is something to celebrate, not fear.
Meanwhile, who won Iowa? Who cares?

Glitchy app linked to Clinton campaign vets

Texto completo: The smartphone application blamed in part for the ongoing delay in reporting results of the Monday Iowa caucuses is linked with key Iowa and national Democrats associated with Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign.
The revelation came as the Nevada Democratic Party announced Tuesday it would not be using the same app in its Feb. 22 caucuses, despite earlier reports to the contrary.
The app was issued by Jimmy Hickey of Shadow Inc., metadata of the program that the Des Moines Register analyzed Tuesday shows. Gerard Niemira and Krista Davis, who worked for Clinton's 2016 campaign, co-founded Shadow.
Company officials did not respond Tuesday to a request for comment. But a short time after the Des Moines Register published a story revealing the link, the company tweeted an apology.
"We sincerely regret the delay in the reporting of the results of last night's Iowa caucuses and the uncertainty it has caused to the candidates, their campaigns, and Democratic caucus-goers," Shadow's message said.
Iowa Democratic Party Chairman Troy Price worked as Clinton's 2016 Iowa political director. He did not immediately respond to requests for comment Tuesday about the relationship between the party and Shadow, which it paid $63,184 for website development and travel expenses, according to reports filed with the Iowa Ethics & Campaign Disclosure Board.
The Nevada party paid Shadow $50,143 for "monetary expenses," filings with the Nevada secretary of state show. The filings provided no further details.
It was unclear whether the Iowa Democratic Party had chosen the app on its own, or had received guidance from the national party. Shadow's website indicates close ties to the National Democratic Party.
Security watchdogs had called on Iowa Democrats to be more transparent about the development and testing of the app prior to Monday's caucuses. But Democrats declined to name the developer or provide testing details, saying top cybersecurity experts advised against releasing too much information because the vendor being targeted.
Shadow collected $153,768 in 2019 from seven different Democratic or advocacy campaigns, mostly for technology, software and subscription services such as text messaging, according to Federal Election Commission data. Among them were the presidential campaigns of former Vice President Joe Biden and former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, as well as the Democratic Party of Wisconsin, according to the federal reports.
Price on Tuesday issued a statement saying that because of a coding problem, the app reported only partial data.
"We have determined that this was due to a coding issue in the reporting system," Price said. "This issue was identified and fixed. The application's reporting issue did not impact the ability of precinct chairs to report data accurately."
There were numerous complaints Tuesday from county- and precinct-level Democratic chairs that the app had been troublesome in the lead-up to the caucuses, and again on caucus night. Many said they had attempted to report their results by phone instead of using it, but encountered long hold times and dropped calls.
Deb Copeland, a Des Moines precinct chair, said her team chose to report results via phone.
"I didn't even bother" to download the app "because we had an informal Facebook group and people were saying they couldn't get it to do anything and had so many questions," Copeland said.
Nevada Democratic party chair William McCurdy II said in a statement Tuesday morning that Nevada will not be employing the same app or vendor.
The party had previously announced plans to use an app to tabulate results at caucuses, as Iowa did, along with a second app pre-loaded onto tablets available for voters to use at caucus sites during four days of early voting.
McCurdy said Nevada Democrats had already developed "a series of backups and redundant reporting systems and are currently evaluating the best path forward."
The Iowa caucus app did not appear to have anything programmed into it that "was malicious or necessarily noteworthy," but there were multiple security concerns associated with its use, said Tim LeMaster, director of systems engineering at Lookout, a cybersecurity company based in San Francisco.
LeMaster said the program was "sideloaded" onto phones, a term used to describe apps that do not come from a source like Google Play Store that generally vets programs for cyber security. That means the rigor of the caucus app's testing remains unknown, he said.
In addition, the program required users to turn off some security controls in order for their phones to accept the application, LeMaster noted.
The Iowa app was not vetted or evaluated by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Christopher Krebs, the department's cybersecurity agency director, told the New York Times on Monday night.
Kiersten Todt, managing director of the Cyber Readiness Institute, an organization started by the CEOs of businesses like Microsoft to reduce hacking risks, had expressed cautions about the app prior to Monday's caucus. On Tuesday, she called for political parties and the federal government to do a better job of working together on elections, which she said could have helped Iowa avoid the reporting problems.

What's ahead for the Orioles?

Texto completo: Mike Elias isn't saying much about the Houston Astros' sign-stealing scandal that rocked Major League Baseball, despite being a part of the organization when the incident occurred.
"I'm not going to give an in-depth comment on the topic, but we're going to do things the right way with the Orioles," he said.
Instead, Elias is focused on his second season as general manager of the Baltimore Orioles, acting as a guest speaker at the Delmarva Shorebirds' annual hot stove banquet on Jan. 23.
The event serves as an opportunity for fans and officials to come together to talk baseball.
The Shorebirds are just four months removed from their historic 2019 season that saw the club win 90 games and advance to the postseason for the first time since 2005. The squad was led by a strong group of pitchers, highlighted by Grayson Rodriguez and Drew Rom, and solid position players, such as infielder Adam Hall and outfielder Robert Neustrom.
Delmarva also hosted 2019 No. 1 overall selection Adley Rutschman toward the end of the season. Elias said he would like to see the catcher start the upcoming season with the Frederick Keys, however it will depend on his performance in spring training.
But Thursday night was about 2020 and how the Shorebirds, and Orioles, would find ways to succeed.
Baltimore was the second worst team in the MLB last season, finishing the year with a 54-108 overall record. However, with a young core expected to make the big-league club, the Orioles' general manger is confident the organization's rebuild is going as planned.
"Some of the names we've been reading about are going to start to arrive in Camden Yards," Elias said. "It's still about player development and those individual performances and not necessarily the team's win and loss record. Those guys are taking steps forward, graduating to the big leagues and adjusting to big-league life."
Elias also expressed his satisfaction with Baltimore's minor-league system.
The Bowie Baysox — the Orioles' Double-A affiliate — also advanced to the postseason, while the Aberdeen Ironbirds — the short-season club — finished with some of their best numbers in history.
After leading the club in 2019, Shorebirds' manager Kyle Moore was promoted to Frederick, replacing longtime skipper Ryan Minor who was let go from the organization. Dave Anderson, who has been with the Orioles the last six years, most recently as a minor-league infield coordinator, will take over on Delmarva.
"It's exactly what you want to see, especially when you're in a rebuild," he said. "We're focused on that type of success. The success of teams like the Shorebirds is really going to dictate what we do the next couple of years in Baltimore."
In November, news broke that several minor-league teams throughout the country were on the chopping block as part of a new MLB plan to streamline its minor league system for efficiency and to improve conditions for players, according to a New York Times report. The Frederick Keys was one of 42 clubs on the list.
While nothing is official, minor-league officials have said they'll do everything in their power to prevent the loss of any team. Elias provided little information on the status of Frederick or how the Orioles will respond should they lose any club.
"All I know is that this is being handled at the league level," he said. "I think Major League Baseball wants to see a healthier player development environment, and minor-league baseball has a lot of interest as well, and I'm sure both sides will come up with a solution."
Though he couldn't say much, Elias did respond to questions about the recent situation regarding the Astros.
Recently, The Athletic reported the Astros had used technology to steal opposing teams' signs that allowed Houston batters to know what type of pitch was coming. The Astros would go on to win the 2017 World Series.
Once news of the scandal broke, Houston was fined $5 million by the MLB and forced to forfeit draft picks in the 2020 and 2021 MLB Draft. General manager Jeff Luhnow and field manager A.J. Hinch were fired following a suspension sent down by the league.
Elias served as Houston's assistant general manager and oversaw player development and minor-league operations before coming to Baltimore in 2018.
Elias said his primary duties in Houston were dealing with the minor leagues and scouting, noting the scandal doesn't detract from the work he and his staff did in those areas.
"I think there's a history of things happening in our sport and other sports, and that's why we have good people in the sport to get it fixed and be better," Elias said.
While one general manager spoke of the future, the other highlighted the success of 2019 and discussed some notable events taking place at Arthur W. Perdue Stadium next season.
Coming off a 90-win season, Shorebirds' general manager Chris Bitters is excited to have fans back at the ballfield watching some of the Orioles' top prospects.
"We're kicking off baseball for bird land right here in Salisbury," he said. "Last year was the cherry on top. We had all these great things going on and then boom, we catapult to best team record in team history.
"We had exciting baseball every night."
The Shorebirds also unveiled their promotional schedule for 2020, which includes several giveaways and theme nights.
A Trey Mancini Jedi bobblehead will be given away on May 8, while a Hawaiian shirt giveaway will take place on June 26. Theme nights include Harry Potter (May 22) and Nickelodeon Night (July 17).
"There's going to be great opportunities throughout the year for the fans to come out and enjoy a giveaway, fireworks night or a value night," Bitters said.
Delmarva kicks off its season April 8 at home against the Asheville Tourists. Team rosters will be announced following spring training.

Texto completo: A writer since childhood, Jack Burns told the Globe in 1973 that he had finished his first novel at age 11. But it was comedy sketches, rather than books, that brought him fame.
After serving in the Marines, and stints at radio stations in Brockton and Athol, Mr. Burns was working at WEZE-AM in Boston when he met George Carlin.
“We got into the habit of clowning around together when off the air," Mr. Burns said in 1973. “Carlin left to go to Fort Worth, Texas, in 1959, and the following year I decided to make the break, too."
Mr. Burns, whose early comedy performances with Carlin led to a more memorable engagement as the hilariously pompous half of the comedy duo Burns and Schreiber, died on Jan. 27 in Toluca Lake, Calif. He was 86.
Burns and Schreiber became one of the best-known comedy teams of the 1960s and '70s. Afterward, Mr. Burns found further success writing for television. The New York Times reported that Patti Lawhon, the executor of his estate, announced the death of Mr. Burns, who learned in 2017 that he had pancreatic cancer.
Mr. Burns was a popular comic presence for nearly 40 years, beginning with a brief, successful stint as Carlin's partner. After his long and fruitful partnership with Avery Schreiber ended, Mr. Burns went on to produce “The Muppet Show," writing about two dozen episodes.
He also wrote for such variety shows as “Hee Haw" and comedy specials starring Flip Wilson and Paul Lynde. And he lent his brash, booming voice to such animated series as “Animaniacs" and “Wait Till Your Father Gets Home," as well as to an ad campaign promoting the use of safety belts. He was the voice of a crash-test dummy.
But it was Burns and Schreiber that cemented his fame. The two comics became known for routines that were flecked with social satire, exquisite timing, and rapid-fire repartee, exemplified by their signature “yeah/huh?/yeah/huh?" bantering.
Mr. Burns's loud know-it-all persona played well off Schreiber's warm, low-key one, particularly when Schreiber, as he so often did, punctured Mr. Burn's pomposity. That was never more vividly on display than in their best-known sketch, in which a blithely bigoted passenger (Mr. Burns) blathers to a world-weary taxicab driver (Schreiber).
In one version of the sketch, Mr. Burns recognizes Schreiber from a previous ride and tells him that he sells tinsel for a living.
Burns: Tinsel, like you put on your Christmas tree.
Schreiber: Like you put on your Christmas tree.
Burns: Oh, I remember now, you told me. You're not of the Christian persuasion.
Schreiber: I'm not persuaded.
Burns: You're what we call your Judaic.
Schreiber: If it makes you uncomfortable, you know you can get another cab.
Burns: Are you kidding? I don't care what a man is. Besides, I couldn't get another cab this time of night anyway.
When they performed the sketch as part of a Second City revue in Manhattan in 1964, New York Times critic Brian O'Doherty praised Mr. Burns as a “connoisseur of vulgarity who apparently can sweat at will," and Schreiber as “an underplaying comic master attached to a Stalinesque mustache."
The duo spent parts of a dozen years together and had their own series on ABC-TV.
Their breakthrough occurred when they performed at a fund-raiser to benefit a Los Angeles School where Schreiber's wife taught.
“I was glad to help out," Mr. Burns told the Globe in 1973. “We were only supposed to do 20 minutes, but it stretched to an hour, went over fabulously well, and then the offers started pouring in."
Referring to the hosts of that era's TV shows, he added: “We wound up doing three Flip Wilsons, three Johnny Carsons, one 'Midnight Special,' all NBC, and two David Frosts."
John Francis Burns was born in Boston on Nov. 15, 1933, and grew up in Newton and Brookline. His father, Garrette, was a military officer; his mother was Mary (Hogan) Burns.
Mr. Burns served in the Marines in Korea in the early 1950s, and upon returning home, “I used the GI Bill to get two years of training at the Leland Powers School," he recalled in 1973.
When he and Carlin were working at WEZE, they became friends and realized each had developed a comedic Irish character.
“Jack's guy had more of an edge," Carlin said of his banter with Mr. Burns in his autobiography, “Last Words" (2009, with Tony Hendra). “These two guys would talk together for hours. They were great characters for saying things you weren't quite willing to say yourself."
Upon both leaving Boston, they became a team and found success in Los Angeles. “Lenny Bruce spotted us at a coffee house, where we worked for no pay, and got us a booking in Chicago," Mr. Burns later recalled.
Burns and Carlin, as the act was known, were booked at top nightclubs around the country, appeared on Jack Paar's “Tonight" show and recorded an album at the Hollywood nightclub Cosmo Alley — although it was released in 1963 (a year after they broke up) as “Burns and Carlin at the Playboy Club Tonight."
After the split, Mr. Burns joined the Compass Players, an improvisational troupe, and then moved to its successor, The Second City, where he met Schreiber and developed the taxicab sketch.
“It's a give-and-take thing," Mr. Burns said in 1973 of how they created their routines. “Usually I write a sketchy outline, then we bat ideas around in our old improvisational way, then I do the final polish."
During their run as a comedy team, Mr. Burns was cast in 1965 on “The Andy Griffith Show" as Deputy Sheriff Warren Ferguson, replacing Don Knotts, who had played Deputy Sheriff Barney Fife since the series began in 1960. Mr. Burns had hoped that he would be able to adapt his onstage style to the character and not remind viewers of the beloved Knotts.
But it did not work out, and Mr. Burns lost the role after 11 episodes. Griffith blamed himself, telling the Times, “We tried to force Jack to do those wild, peculiar things that Knotts did — and he was willing to try — but we made a mistake."
In 1973, Mr. Burns told the Globe that he had married Violet Bardo in 1965. He retired nearly 20 years ago and leaves no immediate survivors, the Times reported. Schreiber died in 2002.
He was a guest star on various TV shows from the late 1960s until the late '90s. He also had established a successful second career off camera.
For a decade he was integral to the Muppet empire. In addition to his association with “The Muppet Show," which began in 1976 and earned him two Emmy nominations, he collaborated with Jerry Juhl to write “The Muppet Movie" (1979) and was a writer on two straight-to-video Muppet productions, both released in 1985.

Texto completo: Now that the Senate has brought the lower House impeachment effort to closure, obviously the winner here is President Trump. He will probably serve a second term in part due to voter backlash generated by this feeble attempt at removing him from office. The American people will also benefit, assuming the future Congresses take note of the negative aspects of initiating a purely political based impeachment effort.
The U.S. House of Representatives now has egg on its face for mounting this doomed from the start effort. But there are some other losers that we should recognize that were also involved here. As with the Trump/Russia collusion hoax they gleefully promoted, ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN, The New York Times, The Washington Post, and other biased liberal news reporting agencies are again taking a hit.
Their hour-by-hour, minute-by-minute news coverage cheering on the event, which included descriptors such as momentous, historic, bombshell, dramatic, stunning, explosive and dazzling have failed to ring true. These networks constantly reported in a wishful thinking mode throughout the process, and have obviously diminished their journalistic credibility.
I predict that these news outlets will be taken less seriously by Americans going forward. Like me, folks are seeing through the liberal bias and poorly reported stories coming from these organizations, and tuning out. Should their ratings, and/ or print sales tank, they have only themselves to blame. Theres an old adage, "What goes around, comes around." And that definitely applies here.

Impeachment result leaves Trump unrepentant and unleashed

Texto completo: During a meeting with Donald Trump at Trump Tower in June 2016, with the opéra bouffe builder improbably heading toward the nomination, I asked when he would pivot.
We all assumed he would have to pivot, that he would have to stop his belittling Twitter rants, that he would have to cease attacking fellow Republicans like John McCain, that he would have to get more in line with the traditional stances of his party, that he would have to be less of a barbarian at the gates of D.C.
He crossed his arms, pursed his lips and shook his head — a child refusing vegetables.
How naive he was, I thought to myself. But I was the naive one. Trump has forced the world to pivot to him.
The state of the union is upside down and inside out. Trump has changed literally everything in the last three years, transforming and coarsening the game.
On Friday night, he became, arguably, the most brutishly powerful Republican of all time. Never has a leader had such a stranglehold on his party, subsuming it with one gulp.
As the Senate voted 51-49 to smother the impeachment inquiry, guided by the dark hand of Mitch McConnell, it felt like the world’s greatest deliberative body had been hollowed out, diminished.
The impeachment trial amounted to one side being earnest and one pretending to be. It was exactly what Nancy Pelosi feared would happen before she was reluctantly drawn into the show trial.
Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., dismissed Republicans as “a cult of personality” around Trump.
“This trial in so many ways crystallized the completely diametrically opposed threats that Democrats and Republicans see to the country,” Murphy told Nicholas Fandos of The New York Times. “We perceive Donald Trump and his corruption to be an existential threat to the country. They perceive the deep state and the liberal media to be an existential threat to the country.”
I feel like I have spent my career watching the same depressing dynamic that unspooled Friday night: Democrats trying, sometimes ineptly, to play fair, and Republicans ruthlessly trying to win.
I watched it with the Anita Hill-Clarence Thomas hearings. I watched it in the 2000 recount with Bush versus Gore. I watched it with the push by W., Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld to go to war in Iraq. I watched it with the pantomime of Merrick Garland.
Democrats are warning Republicans that they will be judged harshly by history. But in the meantime, the triumphant Republicans get to make history. And a lot of the history that Republicans have made is frightening: the endless, futile wars, the obliviousness to climate change, the stamp on the judiciary.
As he voted against witnesses and documents, Lamar Alexander, McConnell’s pal, said Trump did something inappropriate but they just did not accept that it was impeachable, and they did not want to tear up ballots and “pour gasoline on cultural fires that are burning out there.”
So why not shut it down and cover it up? The books were cooked from the start.
As with so many other pivotal moments in modern history, Republicans wanted to win, not look for the truth. And history, God help us, is written by the winners.
Maureen Dowd is a columnist for The New York Times.

Texto completo: A man with ties to Lancaster County was killed last week in New York City.
Kenneth Savinski was found strangled with his throat slit Wednesday in his Manhattan apartment, according to the New York Times.
The 64-year-old owned a home in the 100 block of North Concord Street in Lancaster city from 2004 to 2017. Savinski was an antiques dealer who frequently traveled to Lancaster to visit relatives, the New York Times reported.
Police charged 24-year-old Alex Ray Scott, of Oklahoma, with murder. He pleaded not guilty.
The New York Times reported Scott walked into a Manhattan police station with cuts on his hands Thursday and said he may have killed someone. It also reported his court-appointed lawyer said he doesn’t remember much of the last few days, and suggested that he might have been deliberately drugged.
Scott is wanted in Oklahoma on charges he molested a 5-year-old boy, according to the New York Times. A bench warrant was issued for his arrest on Jan. 22, according to Oklahoma court records.

Trump is right to call them 'government schools'

Texto completo: In his State of the Union address on Tuesday night, President Trump said, “no parent should be forced to send their child to a failing government school." Although reporters at the New York Times and the Washington Post have already taken issue with the terminology, Trump is absolutely right to call them “government schools” instead of "public schools." Here’s why.
Trump was referring to schools that are run by the government. Although the federal government does not directly operate individual schools, they are controlled by school districts, which are local government entities. These schools are also funded by a mix of federal, state, and local tax dollars that come with large amounts of regulations from various government agencies.
Calling these schools “public” is inaccurate for a few reasons. For one, these schools are not open to all members of the public. Because children are generally assigned to schools in the United States by residence, government-run schools regularly exclude students based on their ZIP codes.
In fact, several parents have been fined and even sent to jail for trying to get their children into better government schools by lying about their residences. Government-run magnet schools often use selective admissions processes. The government also compels us to attend schools and pay for their services regardless of how satisfied we are with the product.
Furthermore, government-run schooling is not a “public good,” according to the economic definition. A “public good” is both nonexcludable and nonrivalrous, and government-run schools fail both conditions. Schools can (and do) exclude people, and there are only a limited number of seats in each classroom.
It’s also not clear that government schools are even providing a meaningful “public benefit” since many of them consistently underperform despite getting more money year after year.
Using the term “government school” is also beneficial because it provides clarity to discussions about the education system. Because privately run charter schools are considered “public schools” by the Department of Education and many other government and nongovernment entities, using the term “public school” in conversations requires unnecessary clarification.
“Government school” is the most accurate term to use. The schools are government-run and government-funded. This fact makes people who defend the government-run school system very uncomfortable. But instead of trying to hide the fact that the government runs our schools, defenders of the status quo should think about why the truth about our education system makes them feel so uncomfortable.

‘A simple business decision’: VA secretary says sacking of James Byrne not related to handling of sexual misconduct case

Texto completo: Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert Wilkie said today that the abrupt firing of Deputy Secretary James Byrne was “a simple business decision” and that reports of any connection to mishandling a sexual harassment case were “categorically not true.”
Byrne’s firing was announced on Monday in a two-line statement that explained the removal was “due to loss of confidence” in his “ability to carry out his duties.” Wilkie hoped to satisfy public and congressional calls for an explanation by addressing the issue before a planned talk on veteran suicide prevention at the National Press Club in Washington.
“It was in the best interest of the organization and in the best interest of carrying on the reforms that have taken place,” Wilkie said. The secretary praised Byrne’s military service as a Marine Corps veteran and said, “Some people in the organization just don’t gel with the rest of the team.”
Wilkie said the firing was an exercise in accountability at all levels of the 370,000-employee federal agency, the second-largest in the nation.
Byrne served just under five months as deputy secretary and was confirmed by the Senate on Sept. 11 by a bipartisan vote of 81-11. Before Byrne was named acting deputy in August, the position was vacant for 10 months.
Reports surfaced this week that Byrne was fired over the mishandling of a sexual harassment charge raised in September by Navy intelligence veteran Andrea Goldstein, who told the New York Times that she was slammed into a wall at a VA Medical Center in Washington by a man who pressed his body up against hers.
After Byrne was fired, Goldstein posted a story saying that her sexual assault claim was closed by the VA two weeks ago for “insufficient evidence,” and that Wilkie had written to House Veterans' Affairs Committee Chairman Mark Takano, a California Democrat, saying that VA facilities were safe and warning that the “unsubstantiated claims” of those such as Goldstein could deter veterans from seeking the care they need.
Wilkie appeared to backtrack from the spirit of the letter to Takano when he said he wanted answers to the case for Goldstein, the VA, and all female veterans.
“I’m not satisfied with the resolution of the Goldstein case,” he said in response to a reporter’s question. “Our women veterans have to know if our facilities are safe.” The secretary said he promised Takano in a Tuesday meeting that he would make a “renewed push to get answers” to help the VA and female veterans feel safe and welcome.
On Wednesday, Wilkie sought to underscore the importance of creating a safe space for female veterans and increase “parity” in their use of VA services, which stands at 41%, or 780,000 female veterans. By comparison, men use VA services at a rate of 48%.
The secretary said when he took office two years ago, only 25% of female veterans used VA services.
To further distance Byrne’s firing from the Goldstein case, Wilkie said the firing “just happened to occur when the story reemerged again.”
The three days of silence concerning the rationale for the firing made some members of Congress uneasy and concerned about veterans’ care.
“We need an explanation of his departure,” Rep. Greg Steube, a Florida Republican and member of the VA House Committee, told the Washington Examiner in an email.
“The Department of Veterans Affairs has long been plagued with poor service and unacceptable conduct that is frankly inexcusable,” he wrote. “It is my hope that this latest staffing issue does not add to those problems.”
Wilkie said on Wednesday that “not an appointment has been missed, not an operation canceled,” as a result of the departure of the VA’s fourth deputy secretary in three years. However, the secretary also gave no timeline for filling the post.
The VA said on Tuesday that under President Trump, the agency has seen “more patients than ever before, more quickly than ever before.” The department said that in fiscal year 2019, the VA completed more than 59.9 million internal appointments, about 1.7 million more than the year before.
“James Byrne’s dismissal will not affect this unprecedented progress,” VA spokesperson Christina Mandreucci told the Washington Examiner by email on Tuesday.
Mandreucci added that the VA “compares favorably to the private sector” for access and quality of care. Wilkie said today that the VA made 6.8 million private-sector referrals last year.

Daily on Energy: Trump won’t meet Democrats halfway on climate change

TRUMP WON’T MEET DEMOCRATS HALFWAY: Democrats and Republicans are divided on many issues, and President Trump outlined his approach to some of them during his State of the Union last night: healthcare, immigration, and so on.
But climate change stands alone as an issue that Trump doesn't rate worth mentioning at all, while Democrats are making it a top area of focus.
Trump’s speech, a sales pitch for re-election, suggested he won’t be making the pivot urged by some of his advisers to take climate change seriously.
That means climate change could be the most split-screen issue of any in 2020.
Democrats dinged Trump for not mentioning climate change, although he did tout his recent announcement to join the Trillion Trees Initiative (without connecting it to global warming).
“In the year 2020, how can a president of the United States give a State of the Union speech and not mention climate change?” Bernie Sanders said in remarks in New Hampshire directly following Trump’s speech.
Pete Buttigieg, battling Sanders for the top spot in the contested Iowa caucuses, also took aim at Trump on Wednesday.
“The presidency is not just a policy job. The presidency also sets the tone for what the country considers important,” Buttigieg said during an appearance at a climate change town hall in New Hampshire. “That’s why there is such damage being done from just the fact of the president sending the message it's okay to treat climate change as a hoax.”

BUTTIGIEG MOVES TO CLARIFY NUCLEAR STANCE: At the New Hampshire town hall, Buttigieg somewhat clarified his views on nuclear energy, one of the few climate issues that has divided Democrats.
"I don't think nuclear as we know it is the future," he said, not explicitly ruling out small nuclear reactors that are being developed. He would not invest in new nuclear unless safety concerns are addressed, he said — which is the problem small reactor developers hope to solve.
Buttigieg is more direct about his support for keeping existing nuclear plants online.
"This is not a time to be dogmatic," he said, subtly contrasting his position with Sanders, who has vowed to not renew operating licenses for existing plants. “Nuclear does have a place in the short and medium mix.”
MAJOR UNION BACKS BIDEN FOR ‘ALL OF THE ABOVE’ ENERGY APPROACH: The nation’s largest union of electrical workers endorsed Joe Biden on Wednesday because of his support for an “all of the above” approach to energy policy.
Eighty-five percent of the members of the union, the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, which boasts 750,000 members, work in the energy industry, many in fossil fuel jobs.
“It’s not typical for the IBEW to endorse this early in the primary process, but this year, there’s an urgency we haven’t seen in a very long time,” said Lonnie Stephenson, the union's international president. “Energy policies made today will reverberate for decades, and it’s paramount we have a candidate for president who supports IBEW jobs and values.”
The IBEW, along with other unions, has been skeptical of the liberal "Green New Deal" because of its vision for mandating the elimination of fossil fuels in favor of clean energy.
The Green New Deal resolution calls for “a fair and just transition for all communities and workers," as fossil fuel jobs are eliminated.
Read more from Josh’s story this morning.
TRUMP BACKS CLEAN TRANSPORTATION: The bipartisan Senate transportation bill Trump endorsed in his State of the Union remarks is the first highway bill to have a full-fledged climate section.
That includes allocating millions from the Highway Trust Fund to help fund a buildout of electric vehicle charging infrastructure and offer grants to states to slash transportation emissions, according to a section-by-section of the legislation.
The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee has already unanimously approved the bill, from Chairman John Barrasso and ranking member Tom Carper — though only Barrasso received recognition from Trump when he called on Congress to pass the bill.
‘LIKE ROBBING PETER TO PAY PAUL’: Gina McCarthy, who led the Environmental Protection Agency during Obama’s second term, isn’t sure carbon capture is worth the public health risks, especially if the technology is linked to more oil production.
“I know there’s a lot of creative thinking about CCS, but the thing we’re not looking at is the fact that you extract the fossil fuels itself,” said McCarthy, now head of the Natural Resources Defense Council, Wednesday during a hearing before the House Select Committee on the Climate Crisis. That extraction is a “decision point” that emits “significant amounts” of pollutants like the potent greenhouse gas methane, she added.
Abby has McCarthy’s full comments here.
SPEAKING OF CARBON CAPTURE: Everyone wants to know what’s taking the Treasury Department so long to issue rules to implement key bipartisan tax credits for the technology, signed into law nearly two years ago.
“There is no legitimate excuse for this regulation having taken two full years,” said Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, a Rhode Island Democrat who helped shepherd the expanded carbon capture incentives through Congress. Whitehouse, speaking Tuesday at an event at the Atlantic Council, encouraged carbon capture developers and others to give the Treasury Department a “swift kick in the rear.”
Pent-up frustration has been building among carbon capture advocates and even within the administration as the Internal Revenue Service has moved slowly on determining how to implement the tax credits. The Energy Department’s top fossil energy official, Steve Winberg, said recently the hold-up had “billions of dollars” of potential projects on the line.
Whitehouse, though, doesn’t think the Treasury Department is slow-walking the guidance with ill intent or out of unwillingness to back carbon capture.
“My sense at this point is some combination of incompetence and disinterest,” Whitehouse told Abby. “Because there’s really not much here not to like. So it’s a little bit of a mystery why they haven’t made more progress on it.”
ENERGY DEPARTMENT DOLES OUT MONEY TO SOLAR: The Department of Energy announced Wednesday is it providing $125.5 million in new funding for advanced solar research.
“The research and development supported by this investment will build on the technological foundations necessary to continue the solar industry’s growth and preserve American energy choice, independence, and security,” said Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette.
The money will go to research extending the lifetimes of solar PV systems, along with projects enabling solar and storage, enhancing cybersecurity, developing solar-powered microgrids, and siting solar with agriculture, among other things.

Dropped by Oprah, film on Simmons is picked up

Texto completo: A documentary about the women who have accused Russell Simmons of sexual misconduct has found itself a new home after its original backers, Oprah Winfrey and Apple’s streaming service, dropped the film last month amid a pressure campaign by the hip-hop mogul.
The film, “On the Record,” will appear on HBO Max, the new streaming service from Warner Media set to launch in May, the company said in a news release Monday.
The announcement comes just more than a week after the film debuted to glowing early reviews at the Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah, in January, and close to a month after Winfrey removed herself as executive producer of the film and took her distribution partner, Apple TV Plus, with her.
“On the Record” tells the story of music executive Drew Dixon and her decision, in the early weeks of the #MeToo movement, to publicly accuse Simmons of raping her. (Her account of the 1995 encounter was first reported in The New York Times in 2017.)
Kirby Dick and Amy Ziering, two documentarians whose previous work has focused on sexual assault in the military (“The Invisible War”) and on college campuses (“The Hunting Ground”), tracked Dixon’s journey along with those of other women who accused Simmons of sexual misconduct, including Sil Lai Abrams, Sheri Hines, Jenny Lumet and Alexia Norton Jones. The film also addresses the various cultural forces that have prevented black women from reporting sex crimes. Simmons, who has not been charged with a crime, has maintained that he did not sexually assault anyone.

“The fierce determination of Drew Dixon and all of the women who bravely chose to share their stories in ‘On The Record ’ moved us profoundly,” Sarah Aubrey, head of original content at HBO Max, said in a statement. “I’ve been impressed with Amy and Kirby’s work over the years covering this complex subject matter, and look forward to this film finding the widest possible audience.”
“On the Record” will receive at least a one-week theatrical release to qualify it for Oscar consideration, but the date of its opening in theaters or on HBO Max has not yet been determined.
Accepted into Sundance at the beginning of December, “On the Record” was one of the most anticipated documentaries at the festival. But its future became muddied when Winfrey announced her exit from the project at the beginning of the year, citing “creative differences” with the filmmakers. She later revealed, in an interview with The New York Times, that she had been pressured by Simmons to withdraw.
Winfrey said that Simmons had no role in her exit. “I told him directly in a phone call that I will not be pressured either into, or out of, backing this film,” she said. “I am only going to do what I believe to be the right thing.”
Rather, she said that she believed the film had not adequately addressed inconsistencies in Dixon’s account, although Winfrey said she still believed Dixon. She also said the documentary had not done enough to tackle the misogyny within the broader hip-hop culture at the time Dixon was active in the industry.
The filmmakers said they had addressed all of Winfrey’s concerns.
“Kirby and I are so proud to be teaming with HBO Max to give this film the outstanding platform it deserves and can’t wait for the public to see and hear the voices of these courageous women,” Ziering said in a statement.

Texto completo: Late last year, the Crystal Mountain Resort announced it would no longer sell ski-lift tickets at its windows on weekends, a startling move in an industry that has historically sought volume and the high margin returns from single-day lift ticket sales.
The resort, in the shadow of Washington’s Mount Rainier, has been plagued this season with overfilled parking lots, long lift lines and mountain roads choked with skier vehicles. The crowds were brought on by a cycle of big storms, yes, but also the crush of skiers who hold Ikon Passes, which grant riding privileges at Crystal all season long.
“It’s a very imperfect science, pairing demand with snow and terrain,” said Rusty Gregory, chief executive of Denver-based Alterra Mountain Co., which owns Crystal. “Each resort has to do what’s right for its conditions and its skiers.”
Crystal, which will continue honoring Ikon passes and lift tickets that have been purchased in advance, is not an outlier. The recent introduction of multiresort passes have pushed more skiers to more places, making once-sleepy mountains more crowded. Resorts that are within driving distance of major metropolitan areas, in particular, are coping with powder day throngs not seen before.
Private-equity-backed Alterra kindled an intense round of consolidation among ski resorts when it was formed in 2018 as a rival to Vail Resorts, a public company that owns Vail, Whistler-Blackcomb and Park City, among others. Vail was already selling several forms of its Epic Pass when Alterra introduced the Ikon Pass soon after its formation. The dueling passes, both backed by large balance sheets and aggressive marketing, ushered in a new age for skiers. The two passes now cover every major ski resort in North America in some form.

Skiers who once may have taken a single trip to Colorado or Utah, plus a weekend or two at a mountain within driving distance, all via single-day lift passes, now find value in multiresort passes that can be fairly comprehensive for as little as $700.
As single lift ticket prices at many resorts now approach $200, passes continue to grow more popular. Vail announced in December it had sold more than 1.2 million passes for this winter, an increase of 22%. Alterra doesn’t make its numbers public, but the company said it sold more than 250,000 passes for last winter, and sales for this season, Gregory says, “were up markedly.”
The number of pass holders comprises new ground for the ski industry, which must learn how to deal with crowds popping up in unlikely spots. Eldora Mountain, which was once a quiet local mountain 40 minutes from Boulder, Colorado, has been dealing with hordes of skiers since joining the Ikon Pass. The mountain regularly advises carloads of skiers to turn around on weekend days when the parking lots fill up before noon.
Utah’s Alterra-owned Deer Valley halted lift ticket sales five days this winter to keep skier numbers below its target maximum. At the end of last season, Colorado’s Arapahoe Basin, independently owned but then aligned with Vail’s Epic Pass, announced it would depart the alliance because of crowding issues that ranged from overloaded parking lots to cafeterias where open tables had become rare commodities. A-Basin is now aligned with the Ikon Pass, but with more restrictions.
Many skiers plan trips far ahead of time, but there’s a growing number who embrace the freedom of Epic and Ikon and take a wait-and-see approach, sometimes booking lodging just a few days out.
“These passes facilitate the snow chaser,” said Mary Kate Buckley, president of Jackson Hole Mountain Resort.
Independently owned Jackson saw record amounts of snow last winter, which, combined with the new Ikon Pass (which made up 15% of skiers that year), caused volume to “get out ahead of us,” Buckley said. Jackson has since added a ski lift, increasing its uphill capacity, and brought on line more parking options to decrease crowding on the roads and around the ski area’s base.
In some resort communities new to the Ikon Pass, local gripes last winter grew sharp. Frustrations were so vocal in Jackson and Big Sky, Montana, that resort executives published open letters to their communities, pledging to do better in handling the crowds. In Big Sky’s case, the resort implored locals to welcome out-of-town guests, lamenting a bumper sticker being sold in the area with a play on words: “IKON [not] wait for you to leave.”
Rob Katz, Vail Resorts’ chief executive, said that season pass sales have allowed the industry to better plan ahead and offer better stability to its communities and employees.
“We’re not on as much of a yo-yo anymore,” he said, but managing the additional crowds “requires a tremendous amount of thought.”

Thomas L. Friedman: Mother Nature scoffs at Trump’s middle east peace plan

Texto completo: Tel Aviv, Israel • To get a different perspective on the Trump-Kushner peace plan, I decided to call the best Middle East analyst I know. Her name is Mother Nature.
So, Mother Nature, what did you think of the Deal of the Century?
Well, Tom, not a lot. For starters, it mentioned me in only a few short sentences. Let me take you on a tour of the neighborhood, as I see it. Warning: My maps have no boundary lines, no walls — and no Areas A, B and C in the West Bank.
You can be sure that President Donald Trump, who has declared climate change a hoax, has no idea that the Eastern Mediterranean has experienced drought conditions for 15 of the last 20 years, which is unparalleled in the modern historical record. A recent study by Tel Aviv University predicts that the Eastern Mediterranean will get steadily hotter and drier and gradually lose two months of winter — i.e., rainfall months — within the next 25 years. Meanwhile, in 1948 Israel’s population was 800,000. It’s now 8.7 million. Jordan’s was 450,000. It’s now 10 million. Syria’s was 3 million, and it’s now 17.5 million. So, the future is steadily more people and less water.
What are the implications?
Israel used to pump up to 500 million cubic meters of water a year out of the Sea of Galilee, a freshwater lake, to meet domestic needs, including for agricultural fields in the south of Israel, to turn the desert green. In 2018, Israel could pump out only 30 million cubic meters!
In the summer of 2018, the Sea of Galilee was so low from droughts and water withdrawals for rising populations that it was threatening to become another saline lake, like the Dead Sea. You remember that Jesus walked on water in the Sea of Galilee? Well, you could have done that, too, because it was so low that two islands were visible in the middle of the lake.
How does that affect the Jordan River and all those dependent on it?
Sadly, in the last 50 years, the Jordan River’s annual flow has dropped to a trickle. With Israel, Jordan and Syria each grabbing as much clean water as they can, it’s actually mostly sewage that is keeping the river flowing today . But since a lot of the river is a closed military zone, most people don’t know it’s drying up.
The only guaranteed water for Israel’s big urban centers and farms on its coastal plain is desalinated water and treated wastewater, which have chemical issues. And now, in order to adapt to climate change, Israel is having to reverse the direction of its national water-transportation system — to take desalinated water from its coastal water plants up north to the Sea of Galilee, which, until sustained rainfall this winter began to replenish it, was so diminished it could not serve as Israel’s national water tower.
At the same time, Gaza does not have sufficient sewage treatment facilities, so roughly 100 million liters of raw sewage flows from Gaza every day into the Mediterranean. The prevailing current takes it right up the coast, where Gaza’s waste gets into the filters of Israel’s big Ashkelon desalination plant, which intermittently has had to be shut down to be unclogged.
What about Gaza, Jordan and the West Bank?
Well, Amman recently cut municipal water service from two days a week to eight hours a week for its residents. They have to buy the rest of their water from private vendors. Jordan has had to absorb 1.5 million refugees from Syria’s civil war, which itself was partly prompted by drought. The Jordanian people should get the Nobel Peace Prize for how they have peacefully absorbed so many refugees.
Jordan has 600,000 people living on its side of the Jordan Valley. With markets to Iraq and Syria both disrupted, and a decrease in water supply as a result of drought, youth unemployment on the Jordanian side of the valley is at 40%. The water-intensive crops they, and the Israelis, grow in the valley — tropical and subtropical fruits, like bananas and citrus, and fruits and vegetables for export — are not sustainable. The conditions have left most of these communities impoverished.
How has this affected the war on terrorism?
Jordan was the third-largest contributor of youth recruits to the Islamic State in the Arab world. You can be sure plenty of these recruits were from the Jordan Valley, which is full of frustrated young men who can’t get jobs and so can’t marry. It’s a trifecta of ecological demise, poverty and radicalization.
What about Gaza under Hamas?
Both Israel and Gaza traditionally drew most of their water from the coastal aquifer. The Gaza portion has totally collapsed under Hamas mismanagement, Israeli blockades and overuse. Some 97% of the Gaza aquifer is no longer potable. People there live by filling jerrycans with water from small desalination plants run by private vendors and international organizations. About a quarter of the disease in Gaza today is associated with unhealthy drinking water.
The mountain aquifer running down the spine of the West Bank and Israel is also being rapidly depleted and polluted. The Jewish settlers in the West Bank are connected to the Israeli water system through a sophisticated network that runs 24/7, but the Palestinian cities are not. So, in hot summer months in Bethlehem, for instance, residents get municipal water only episodically.
You also have many West Bank Palestinian villages and towns without sewage treatment facilities. Their raw sewage is tossed into cesspits — unlined holes in the ground — that let the liquid seep into the groundwater and the solids collect, to then be dumped into wadis. Sewage in the greater Hebron area, with over 300,000 people, flows via the Hebron Stream to the Israeli town of Beersheba, where it becomes the Beersheba Stream! As I said, I recognize no borders.
So what would be Mother Nature’s peace principles?
To begin, any plan that carves up the West Bank into siloed political spaces, walls and roads — driven by a Trump-Kushner desire to embrace the “reality” of where Jewish settlers have haphazardly settled around the West Bank — makes no sense to me. This is a single ecosystem, and there will be no physical security for one if there is not human security for all. More than once my flash floods have knocked down Israel’s security barrier around Tulkarm and Jerusalem.
You have to start with the right question: How do we bring peace to this region in an era of rapid population growth and climate change? Not: How do we bring peace to this region in a way that gives primacy to the demands of Israeli, Palestinian or evangelical Christian zealots?
What would your map look like?
Peace and prosperity came to Europe after World War II via the creation of the Common Market. The Common Market was built on trading last century’s main energy source and industrial product — coal and steel. Peace between Israelis and Jordanians and Palestinians will come through a confederation of their sovereign entities based on sea and sun. The only way Israelis, Palestinians and Jordanians will all have water and energy security is through large-scale desalination, and the only way they can get that — and not worsen climate change — is through massive solar-power generation.
How might that work?
Israel and Gaza have vast capacity to tap the Mediterranean Sea for manufactured water, and Jordan has great capacity to tap its vast empty deserts for manufactured solar power. They all should be networked into a confederation, harnessing the sea and sun — with joint commissions to manage water, energy and food security — that would create healthy interdependencies. Then they could all rise economically together. Rather than the siloed, unhealthy interdependency or unilateralism that they are now creating — where they compete for water, energy and food and pollute one another, and fall together.
For more on all of this, look at the work of the organization EcoPeace Middle East and particularly its feasibility study. That group understands me like nobody else.
If you build on my formula, any peace will have to involve mutual respect and respect for my ecosystems — in contrast to the zero-sum thinking of the political extremists now driving this story and messing with Mother Nature. It’s not smart to mess with Mother Nature. Ask the Australians.

Ross Douthat: Who won and who lost the fiasco in Iowa?

Texto completo: The disaster in Iowa on Monday night exemplified so much about the American situation at the moment — the failure of our parties, the self-sabotage of our institutions, the disastrous interaction between creaking political systems and the flimflam “improvements” of the tech economy — that it’s tempting not to attempt political analysis at all and just let the thing stand as a kind of outrageous art installation, a fiasco that speaks for itself so completely that all commentary is superfluous.
But the Democratic primary campaign will continue, and so punditry of some sort is required. So let’s try, in the shadow of absurdity, to figure out what was won and lost Monday night (at least based on the returns we have right now).
Let’s start with one of the de facto co-winners, Pete Buttigieg. Strip away the tabulation problems, and he had a great night: not only outperforming expectations slightly to battle with Bernie Sanders for the top, but also watching Joe Biden sink dramatically, leaving the way clear for the erstwhile mayor to claim to be the viable moderate alternative to Sanders and socialism.
As the biggest winner from the reported results, Buttigieg is therefore the biggest loser from the botched count. He’s deprived of headlines and momentum that both his own vote totals and Biden’s plunge should have earned him, and his decision to serenely claim victory in the midst of a massive technological “upgrade”-turned-meltdown, I’m afraid, played as a bit of an obnoxious McKinsey move. Even if Biden melts down, Buttigieg’s window to become the moderate choice could be a narrow one, lasting only until Mike Bloomberg’s money comes to bear — in which case every day we’re litigating outcomes is a lost one for his campaign.
By contrast, for Buttigieg’s co-winner, Sanders, the botched count actually balances his apparent failure to win decisively, making him a winner in the voting and the fiasco both. Yes, it’s not as good an outcome for Sanders as a thumping 10-point win or a big delegate edge, but the solidity and national spread of his support means that he has the clearest path to the nomination in a permanently divided field, and if one of the main effects of the Iowa disaster will be to delay any winnowing, that’s almost certainly good news for him.
And the fact that it’s Buttigieg rather than Biden sharing the win is also probably good news for Sanders, given that Mayor Pete has negligible support in many national polls and little traction with minority voters. A race where Biden collapses and Buttigieg and Bloomberg scramble to fill that space is almost certainly better for Sanders than a quick consolidation into a Sanders-Biden battle of the septuagenarians — and the first scenario just became a lot more likely.
But less likely than it would have been without the fiasco, which is why Biden, the big loser of the actual voting, is probably the biggest winner of the tabulation debacle: It obscures just how much he slipped beneath his polling, lets Iowa be swallowed up by other stories (the State of the Union, impeachment, coronavirus and then … New Hampshire!), and makes it modestly more likely that he can limp through to South Carolina with a chance to make a stand.
That effect is only modest because voters aren’t momentum-obsessed pundits, and if Biden’s support is as fundamentally weak elsewhere as it proved in Iowa, that will manifest itself going forward regardless of the caucus headlines. But at the very least we can say that Biden is the only candidate competing in Iowa for whom the delayed announcement of the victor is unqualified good news.
For Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar, the disaster’s effect is somewhat less significant. Warren’s apparent third-place performance keeps her in the running, but if she can’t beat either Buttigieg or Sanders in the early states, then her campaign’s only purpose will be to accumulate delegates for a hypothetical brokered convention. In which case maybe the meltdown helps her a little, by making such a marathon more likely — but it might also just obscure her weaknesses relative to the top finishers, giving her a reason to burn donor cash a little longer than she reasonably should.
That’s definitely the case for Klobuchar, whose failure to even come close to catching Buttigieg or Warren in her own Midwestern-High Plains territory should probably finish her campaign: The tabulation meltdown may be a useful excuse to keep her campaign going through New Hampshire and even all the way to South Carolina, but she doesn’t actually have a good reason to stay in.
Finally, for Iowa’s non-competitor, the other mayor in the race, the whole night went beautifully: A wounded Biden and a Buttigieg deprived of the full benefits of victory is pretty much all that Bloomberg could have hoped for in his apparent plan to be the last non-Sanders option standing when Super Tuesday rolls around in March.
And if this also brings us closer to a scenario where Bloomberg succeeds only in pushing the Democrats into a brokered convention that fatally divides the party, helps reelect the incumbent and makes the free-spending billionaire one of history’s goats?
Well, that’s a risk Bloomberg is apparently willing to take — and one reason among many why the biggest winner last night was the man who has been profiting from folly and chaos and stupidity among his rivals since 2015, the president of the United States.

WHY DEMOCRATS NEED THE CENTER AND THE GOP DOESN'T

Texto completo: Polarization in American politics is often framed as two mirror-image parties - increasingly disdainful of one another - employing similar scorched-earth tactics.
But author Ezra Klein, in a recent New York Times essay, explains that polarization in America takes vastly different forms depending on the party. His main thesis? Democrats still need the center. Republicans don't.
"In recent decades, the two parties have been changing, and fast," Klein wrote in his essay, which is based on his book on the subject: "Why We're Polarized."
"Those changes are ideological - the Democratic Party has moved left, and the Republican Party has moved right. But more fundamentally, those changes are compositional: Democrats have become more diverse, urban, young and secular, and the Republican Party has turned itself into a vehicle for whiter, older, more Christian and more rural voters."
The key difference, he wrote, is that the GOP is helped by the arcane Electoral College that makes presidential elections hinge on a handful of tossup states, so that solidly liberal New York and California hardly matter despite their vast populations. Republicans also enjoy outsized influence in the U.S. Senate because deeply conservative but sparsely populated Wyoming, for example, gets the same two senators as does New York.
Such factors enable the GOP to turn even more conservative and focus on its hard-core base. Democrats cannot afford to move to the far left in the same way.
"Democrats can't win running the kinds of campaigns and deploying the kinds of tactics that succeed for Republicans," Klein wrote. "They can move to the left - and they are - but they can't abandon the center or, given the geography of American politics, the center-right, and still hold power. Democrats are modestly, but importantly, restrained by diversity and democracy. Republicans are not.
"To win power, Democrats don't just need to appeal to the voter in the middle. They need to appeal to voters to the right of the middle," he wrote.
So let's consider this reality through the approaches of two politicians - Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, a Wisconsin Republican, and U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, who is running for president as a Democrat.
First there is Vos. In the year-plus since Tony Evers was elected governor, Vos has obstructed and - comically at times - portrayed himself as a sort of a necessary co-governor because, God forbid, Wisconsin elected a Democrat.
Before Evers was inaugurated, Vos pushed legislation to handicap Evers, then spent all of 2019 extinguishing any hint of bipartisanship in the statehouse. Vos apparently cribbed from the playbook of U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who said his top goal was to prevent a second Barack Obama term.
Vos added staff, he said, to keep tabs on Evers, as if that is part of his job, as detailed in a recent story by the Cap Times' Briana Reilly. Such oversight is apparently necessary because Evers is one of those radical Democrats pushing crazy ideas like adequate funding for public education, roads and health care.
Worth noting is that even though Vos seems to see himself as equal to Evers in stature, Evers received more than 1.3 million votes in the last election while Vos got 16,775 in an overwhelmingly GOP district.
Anyway, there was Vos again after Evers' recent State of the State speech, attacking the governor's effort to create a nonpartisan commission to draw new political boundaries in Wisconsin as a "fake, phony, partisan process," which actually describes what the GOP did through its current maps.
The tactics by Vos exemplify how Republicans act when they know that they cannot win fair fights as our state grows more diverse.
They cheat. They also suppress votes, as highlighted by the current court fight about removing from Wisconsin voter rolls the names of those who have changed residences.
Republicans smear people of color and so-called urban elites. The politics of resentment become, in a way, their best and only option.
Still, what Vos and allies do makes perfect sense, if you accept Klein's analysis.
And if you buy Klein's view that Democrats must appeal to the center and even the center-right to win, Evers' approach also makes sense. Much has been written, including by me, about how Evers' practicality and earnestness helped him unseat former GOP Gov. Scott Walker.
And then you have Sanders, whose campaign for president is gaining momentum of late on far-left policies almost certain to scare and demotivate those in the political center and center right. And unlike every other serious Democratic presidential candidate, Sanders shows little interest in pulling the party together if he is not the eventual nominee.
Yes, I know, many here in Madison are smitten by Sanders, and our local congressman, Mark Pocan, is a big Bernie guy.
If you don't like Sanders and say so, his online backers may come after you, which The New York Times explored in a recent news story: "Some progressive activists who declined to back Mr. Sanders have begun traveling with private security after incurring online harassment. Several well-known feminist writers said they had received death threats. A state party chairwoman changed her phone number."
The Sanders campaign apparently believes there are a zillion new voters who will come out like the disaffected on the other side did for Trump. But if you believe Klein, that is sheer fantasy.
As Washington Post columnist Jennifer Rubin wrote recently: "A nominee who insists on personally attacking all doubters and the media might be a model for the Republican Party, but Democrats are not going to win with their own Donald Trump, especially one who has burned bridges and stirred resentment in his own party."
Commentator David Frum chimed in: "The Sanders campaign is a bet that the 2020 race can be won by mobilizing the Americans least committed to the political process while alienating and even offending the Americans most committed to it. It's a hell of a gamble, and for what? To elect to the presidency a person with a proven record of accomplishing little for the causes he espouses, despite almost 32 years in the House and Senate?"
A crabby, holier-than-thou socialist who attacks actual Democrats while huffily rejecting questions about the staggering costs of his agenda is, well, not exactly what Klein prescribes.

Texto completo: Payment service Venmo joined YouTube and Twitter on Wednesday in demanding that a facial recognition company stop harvesting user images to identify the people in them, which the startup does as part of its work with police.
Venmo said Wednesday it is sending a cease-and-desist letter to New York-based Clearview AI. The small firm has drawn scrutiny following investigative reports in January by the New York Times and Buzzfeed detailing its work with law enforcement agencies and its practice of scraping social media and other internet platforms for images.
"Scraping Venmo is a violation of our terms of service and we actively work to limit and block activity that violates these policies," said Venmo spokesman Justin Higgs, who said the Paypal-owned mobile payment service is in the process of sending the letter.
Google-owned video service YouTube sent a similar letter to Clearview on Tuesday.
"YouTube's Terms of Service explicitly forbid collecting data that can be used to identify a person," YouTube spokesman Alex Joseph said in a statement Wednesday. "Clearview has publicly admitted to doing exactly that, and in response we sent them a cease and desist letter."
Clearview CEO Hoan Ton-That told CBS in an interview that it has a First Amendment right to the roughly 3 billion images it has collected.
"The way we have built our system is to only take publicly available information and index it that way," he told CBS.
CBS this morning
He also said the technology is only used by law enforcement to identify potential criminals.
CBS was first to report the YouTube letter Wednesday. Twitter sent a similar letter in January and ordered Clearview to delete all the data it has collected from Twitter, including anything already shared with third parties. Microsoft-owned LinkedIn said Wednesday it is also looking into it and will take "appropriate action" if Clearview violated its terms.
Clearview attorney Tor Ekeland said in a statement Wednesday that the company's technology "operates much in the same way as Google's search engine."

Ascenso de Pete Buttigieg descarrila la campaña de Joe Biden

Texto completo: Los resultados del caucus en Iowa dejaron la primera gran conclusión de las elecciones primarias demócratas: la campaña de Joe Biden no es tan fuerte como se creía.
El exvicepresidente se ubicó en el cuarto lugar de la contienda con 15.6% del conteo. Es cierto que apenas se han reportado 75% de los resultados, pero es difícil que la tendencia cambie. Queda claro que Biden salió de Iowa con cero de los 41 delegados en disputa .
Los ganadores fueron el exalcalde de South Bend, Indiana, Pete Buttigieg , representante del ala centro del partido, con 26.9%, y el senador Bernie Sanders , único socialista en contienda, con 25.2%. La senadora Elizabeth Warren , de centro-izquierda, terminó en tercer lugar con 18.2%.
Los números indican que Buttigieg ganó terreno entre los votantes más alineados con el establecimiento demócrata que se supone son la base de Biden. El joven político se ha distanciado de la agenda progresista de Sanders y Warren a lo largo de la campaña, y ha sido beligerante con las propuestas de seguro médico universal durante los debates.
“No voy a endulzarlo”, dijo Biden el miércoles en declaraciones recogidas por el New York Times. “Recibimos un golpe en las entrañas en Iowa”.
El exvicepresidente no contaba con una victoria en Iowa, pero no puede darse el lujo de repetir un cuarto lugar en New Hampshire (11 de febrero) y Nevada (22 de febrero) antes de llegar a South Carolina (29 de febrero). En este último se espera la primera victoria de Biden ya que los afroamericanos representan una gran fracción de su electorado. Sin embargo, el triunfo en ese estado tendrá que ser abrumador para volver a pisar fuerte. El candidato de 77 años debe evitar a toda costa una tendencia negativa antes de llegar a los territorios que lo favorecen.
Relacionado: Mujer se arrepiente de votar por Pete Buttigieg al enterarse de que es gay
De acuerdo con el Times, el mal rendimiento de Biden en Iowa se debió a su entrada tardía en la contienda (abril de 2019) ya que los rivales llevaba meses visitando el estado. El candidato no dedicó tiempo a hablar con el electorado de manera más íntima, que es uno de sus fuertes.
La controversia por los negocios de su hijo en Ucrania, y que terminaron con el juicio político al presidente Donald Trump, también fue una distracción fatal para la campaña de Biden, que ahora vive una carrera contra el tiempo en busca de un repunte.

Coronavirus fears shadow US visitors returning from China

Texto completo: Marc Herman and Lauren Helm of Cotati underwent no special screening at San Francisco International Airport when the couple returned from a trip to China last week. They had spent most of their time in Nanjing, a metropolis larger than New York City and about 500 miles from Hubei province, where the novel coronavirus had stricken tens of thousands of people.
Herman said he has no symptoms of any illness, but was still asked by his boss at a Sonoma winery to stay home for two weeks just in case. And a contractor refused to continue working on a bathroom repair if they were there, so they stayed at a hotel for a night so he could finish the job. Friends uninvited the couple to a Super Bowl party.
The reaction provides a glimpse of how quickly fear of the new virus is spreading in the United States, even faster than the virus itself.
“It puts things in perspective,” said Herman, 35, who witnessed significant disruption to daily life in China during the nearly three-week trip with his fiancée.
The novel coronavirus has infected more than 24,000  people in China, about half of confirmed cases in Hubei province where the disease was first detected in Wuhan city, according to official reports from the Chinese government. The New York Times reported the virus has resulted in 490 deaths.
To compare, common influenza viruses have infected an estimated 19 million cases in the United States and killed 10,000 people since October, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Because the novel coronavirus is a newly detected virus, health officials don’t know how fast it might spread and how badly people will fall ill.
Outside China, there are another 159 confirmed cases and one death of a man from Wuhan who had traveled to the Philippines, the World Health Organization reported.
Six of 11 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the United States have been in California, and all but one person had recently traveled from Wuhan, according to the CDC. Tests are pending for another 82 people with flu-like symptoms in the country.
Public health officials in the United States have repeatedly said there is only a small risk the novel coronavirus will spread broadly in this country. Travel warnings, quarantines, screenings and the mobilization of public health workers across the globe is meant to stem the spread of a new virus strain with unknown potential.
Local infectious disease specialist Dr. Gary Green compared it to preparing for the possibility of a tsunami after a major earthquake.
“If you plan for the worst-case scenario, you’re prepared. It’s reasonable from a leadership perspective,” said Green, an infectious disease specialist at Sutter Medical Group of the Redwoods.
Part of Green’s job is to track what’s known about the coronavirus, plus the guidance of state and federal health officials, in order to ensure Sutter clinicians have the best information and protocols when treating their patients, he said.
“We want them to have appropriate concern,” said Green, who added that influenza remains a greater priority in Sonoma County. “I have concern for the elderly during the flu season because the elderly are very frail and sometimes it’s very hard for them to survive flu.”
Sonoma County Public Health Officer Dr. Celeste Philip said she’s participating in four to five conference calls each day with state and federal experts on the virus to make sure local policies and procedures are aligned with recommendations and keep pace with the evolving situation.
The best advice remains the same: Wash hands, cough into the elbow and stay home from work if sick. Also, it’s still not too late to get a flu shot, Philip said.
“The overall risk to everyone is low,” Philip said. “It wouldn’t be surprising to have additional cases in California, but what we want is to prevent the virus from being spread from person to person, circulating and being able to infect more people.”
Herman and Helm traveled to China Jan. 13 to visit Hermon’s brother and his family in Nanjing, an ancient city of more than 8  million people that centuries ago was the seat of the Ming dynasty.
They explored the city, which today is filled with endless skyscrapers “as far as the eye can see” and cloaked in smog, Herman said. They traveled to see the renowned Longjing Tea Plantation in Hangzhou and famous classical gardens in Suzhou.
Then the novel coronavirus afflicting thousands of people in Wuhan city more than 500 miles away — the distance between Santa Rosa and San Diego — became a global concern.
Streets once teeming with cars, scooters and people were empty. Restaurants and businesses closed, tourist sites were barricaded. Security guards checked patrons’ temperature before allowing entrance into malls. Herman said his brother was accosted by a stranger at a grocery store and followed home because he wasn’t wearing a face mask.
Nanjing officials canceled public festivities in advance of the Jan. 25 lunar New Year.
“Think about if the central government here canceled Christmas — it’s a big thing,” said Helm, who studied Mandarin in college.
“Think about a city the size of New York — if not bigger — and the streets just being desolate,” Herman said.
They spent about a week and a half holed up in Herman’s brother’s apartment, watching episodes of “The Office” and finding ways to entertain nieces and a nephew. When they went out, security guards at the apartment complex checked their temperatures.
They returned home Jan. 31 with minimal problems, apart from having to find a new flight from Nanjing to Beijing after virus fears disrupted travel within the country. They said they have no symptoms of any illness and a clear opinion that what global public health officials have said could become a pandemic is a remote concern in Sonoma County.
“It’s hypocritical talk when people are afraid of this but they’re not willing to get a flu shot,” Herman said.

De acuerdo con el Times, el mal rendimiento de Biden en Iowa se debió a su entrada tardía en la contienda (abril de 2019) ya que los rivales llevaba meses visitando el estado. El candidato no dedicó tiempo a hablar con el electorado de manera más íntima, que es uno de sus fuertes.
La controversia por los negocios de su hijo en Ucrania, y que terminaron con el juicio político al presidente Donald Trump, también fue una distracción fatal para la campaña de Biden, que ahora vive una carrera contra el tiempo en busca de un repunte.

Texto completo: Is Iowa a metaphor? A harbinger?
Either way it’s a mess — and not the way any Democrat wanted the party’s voting to begin in an election year with stratospheric stakes.
To excite the most Americans possible and have its best chance of toppling President Donald Trump, the Democratic Party needs a sorting of candidates that’s coherent, a system that inspires faith, a process that makes participants feel respected and heard.
Iowa provided none of that Monday night. Instead it staged a baffling spectacle resistant to any timely, definitive verdict. More than 12 hours after the actual, physical caucusing at hundreds of locations across the state had finished, there were still no official results, just resentments, recriminations and reports that a newly intricate manner of counting had proven laborious, a newly developed app for it hadn’t worked as planned, a backup phone line had jammed, and the campaigns had been asked to join a pair of emergency conference calls with state Democratic officials.
Maybe there’s a moral here about dreaming too big and reaching too high. Maybe there’s just a terrifying repeat of the party’s awful luck in 2016.
The candidates were stunned. Their aides were livid. And Democrats nationwide, so hungry for the first signs of resolution in a primary with so many competitive candidates, waited and waited late into the night Monday, and surely, in most cases, gave up and went to bed. Not me. I was too aghast, agitated and curious to see how soon Trump and his enablers would exploit this turn of events.
The inevitable answer: right away. Brad Parscale, the president’s campaign manager, sent a tweet out before midnight Monday Eastern time.
“Democrat party meltdown,” he wrote. “They can’t even run a caucus and they want to run the government. No thank you.”
Lovely — and not the last of it. Trump quickly amplified the gloating and taunting, which, after golf, are his favorite sports. On Tuesday morning he tweeted: “The Democrat Caucus is an unmitigated disaster. Nothing works, just like they ran the Country.” Donald Trump Jr. used his own Twitter account to spread a conspiracy theory about a fraudulent outcome and sniped that “there’s no question anymore that the greatest threat to US Elections is in fact Democrat incompetence.”
The Trumps, Parscale and the rest of their wretched gang will fold what happened in Iowa into their persistent narrative: Democrats are hapless, and the traditions and institutions that Americans are asked to trust don’t deserve that deference.
Iowa is a prompt for cynicism. Cynicism is Trump’s lifeblood.
As predictable as Parscale’s tweet were formal complaints about the credibility of the vote count from Democrats worried about their showing in the caucuses. One came from Joe Biden’s campaign, which argued that “considerable flaws” should be examined and addressed before any results were accepted.
And so the victor in Iowa may be denied his or her full measure of credit and exultation, the losers may be spared some of the usual damage, and one or more of the candidates and his or her supporters may question the fairness and legitimacy of how the entire Democratic primary plays out. It’s 2016 all over again. Wasn’t the party supposed to learn from its mistakes?
There’s no excuse for this, not given how long the Iowa Democratic Party had to prepare, not given the privilege of the state’s first-in-the-nation status, not given how deeply invested tens of millions of distraught Americans are in the effort to get rid of an unfit, amoral president. That effort can’t start like this.
The debacle was a specific betrayal of Iowa’s voters. I spent most of the past week in Iowa, where I was wowed and moved by how much thought Iowans were putting into which candidate they’d caucus for. They made clear that they saw Trump as an existential threat. So they weren’t merely deciding on a favorite candidate. They were anointing a savior and anxiously unsure about who represented the surest and best hope.
I’d never seen voters so twisted into knots. I’d never seen pundits so perplexed by the tea leaves in front of them and so hesitant to play fortuneteller. I’d never been so stymied for insight, so barren of instinct. This wasn’t a political contest; it was a kidney stone.
And by late Tuesday morning, it still hadn’t passed.
The candidates, too, were betrayed, cruelly and destructively so. They tried to work around the crazy ambiguity, delivering remarks to their supporters that neither declared victory nor conceded defeat, because no one was yet victorious and no one yet defeated — not officially.
“Somehow, some way, I’m going to get on a plane tonight to New Hampshire,” Amy Klobuchar told the crowd at her election-night party, and that “somehow, some way” was a nod to the surreal limbo in which the candidates languished.
“We’re going to walk out of here with our share of delegates,” Biden told the crowd at his election-night party. It was a safe statement because it was an utterly and necessarily vacuous one.
Bernie Sanders matched it: “I have a strong feeling that at some point, the results will be announced.”
As the hours ticked by, the Iowa Democratic Party released a statement saying that the delay was attributable to their diligence in resolving inconsistencies and that there was “not a hack or an intrusion” that should stoke doubts about the eventual vote tally.
But doubts had already been stoked. They’ll probably never go fully away. And in an era when “rigged” and “hoax” are the actual mantras of the American president, they’re devastating. They’re unaffordable.
Pete Buttigieg spoke later than other candidates and seemed to have information that convinced him that he’d finished at or near the top.
“An improbable hope became an undeniable reality,” he said, referring to the long odds against a 38-year-old, openly gay man rising this high in the Democratic primary. He gave a shoutout to “the love of my life,” his husband, Chasten.
That moment was historic. But would it be remembered instead as premature and overconfident? Thanks, Iowa, for the clarity on that. Way to get the ball rolling.

Texto completo: First, he was convicted of killing his wife.
Now, Jonathan Nyce, a 70-year-old former pharmaceuticals executive, faces charges of scamming money off the owners of dying dogs.
In an indictment unsealed Tuesday, federal prosecutors accused Nyce, of Collegeville, of bilking desperate pet owners online by selling unapproved drugs he claimed were capable of curing canine cancer.
The new charges come 16 years after he was convicted of beating his wife to death in the garage of their Hopewell Township, N.J., home - a 2004 case that became a true-crime tabloid sensation.
Investigators believe Nyce began his alleged pet-meds scam shortly after his release from an eight-year prison sentence. Marketing his product under the names "Tumexal" and "Naturasone," he allegedly bilked pet owners out of hundreds of thousands of dollars by claiming his medicines could treat "a wide variety of cancers" and restore the ailing pets' "appetite, spirit and energy."
In reality, prosecutors said, the drugs Nyce peddled had not been FDA-approved and were nothing more than a collection of bulk ingredients he mixed at a facility in Collegeville.
Nyce allegedly charged others for access to clinical trials he claimed he was running for other promising treatments. One woman from Illinois, referenced in the indictment, handed Nyce more than $5,000.
U.S. Attorney William M. McSwain called the new accusations against Nyce "shameful" and accused him of taking advantage of nurturing pet owners "doing everything they [could] to keep their beloved pets alive and well."
"That is both cruel and illegal, and now the defendant will face the consequences," he said in a statement.
Nyce is expected to surrender to authorities in the next several days on charges including wire fraud and selling misbranded drugs, a spokesperson for the U.S. Attorney's Office said. Nyce could not be reached for comment Tuesday and it was unclear whether he had retained an attorney.
But Nyce has repeatedly maintained his innocence in the case that first drew him into the public spotlight - including in his 2012 book titled Under Color of Law, which he describes on the dust jacket as a "fact-driven account of an innocent man's nightmare journey through the American criminal justice system."
The 2004 murder of Michelle Rivera Nyce drew national headlines as much for where it took place - a 21-room, 5,600-square-foot McMansion in a tony section of Hopewell Township - as for the high profile of the accused killer.
Nyce, a Temple University graduate and an East Carolina University professor, founded the pharmaceutical firm EpiGenesis and had attracted millions of investor dollars in the '90s for an asthma drug he was developing
He was introduced to Michelle in 1989 after responding to a newspaper ad offering to connect American men with women from the Philippines. She eventually immigrated to the United States, married Nyce, and took a job at the Chanel counter at the Quaker Bridge Mall.
But when Nyce learned she was having an affair with their landscaper in 2004, he confronted her as she returned home one night from one of their trysts. He slammed her head into the floor of their garage, killing her and leaving their home covered in blood.
Nyce panicked after the slaying, investigators testified at his trial. He stuffed his wife behind the wheel of a Land Rover and somehow drove it through their upscale neighborhood using an 18-inch ice pick to press the pedals from the passenger's seat. Eventually, he drove the car off a six-foot drop and into an icy creek bank.
Superior Court found Nyce guilty of passion/provocation manslaughter, a lesser crime than the original charge of murder, and sentenced him to eight years in prison.
Despite the notoriety his case drew, Nyce and his then-attorney, Robin Lord, always maintained that prosecutors had it all wrong.
"If he really wanted to kill his wife," she said in a 2005 interview with the New York Times, "he could have designed a drug to do it."

A modern-day Poe mystery.

Texto completo: Pattye Stringer sent us on a treasure hunt.
Stringer is a guide at East Falls' historic Laurel Hill Cemetery. She leads people past the graves of the famous and the forgotten, including the cemetery's "Millionaires Row," where the bodies of Philly's former moguls and industrialists rest in their own ornately decorated miniature mansions. Her favorite resident of the row: 19th-century newspaperman George W. Childs.
"What happened to the many things collected by George W. Childs, 19th century millionaire newspaperman? His collection included a handwritten manuscript by Edgar Allan Poe. He had no siblings or children," Stringer asked our Curious Philly portal.
Curious Philly is where readers ask us questions, and our reporters track down the answers.
Solving the mystery
A bit of Googling and a visit to The Inquirer's archives on Newspapers.com yielded the locations of two of Childs' prized possessions - the original, handwritten manuscript of Edgar Allan Poe's 1841 short story "The Murders in the Rue Morgue," and that of Charles Dickens' novel Our Mutual Friend.
Tracking them down now is a worthy modern mystery. "Rue Morgue" is considered the first modern detective story. It can now be found in the Rare Book Department of the Free Library of Philadelphia, the city in which Poe wrote it. Our Mutual Friend, also handwritten and autographed by Dickens, is in the Morgan Library & Museum in New York.
How they got there, though, is one those stories that reminds us not only that we can't take it with us, but that our stuff may not stay exactly where we leave it after we're gone.
Who was George W. Childs?
If Childs (1829-1894) was more of a modern-day hero, Tom Hanks might be playing him in a movie.
Though little seems to be known of Childs' early years - one reference describes him as "born in Baltimore, the illegitimate child of a prominent father" - he grew up fast, becoming someone known for his business savvy, his friendships, and his generosity.
Stringer has done her share of the detective work on Childs. "He joined the Navy when he was 12. ... When he was 14, he decided he'd had enough of the Navy. So his commanding officer at the time arranged for him to have a job as a clerk in a bookstore in Philadelphia," she said during a recent visit to Childs' mausoleum.
He saved his money and "went into a partnership with a gentleman by the name of Robert Peterson, who happens to be married to a woman whose father was a prominent judge. So they got into the business of publishing law books," Stringer said.
The publishing house was in the same building as the Public Ledger, one of a number of daily newspapers in Philadelphia at the time, and George, she said, made no secret of the fact that he hoped to own the paper someday.
The opportunity came in 1864, when the Ledger, the only paper in Philadelphia not to take the Union's side in the Civil War, was struggling. Childs bought the Ledger with his partners, brothers Anthony and Francis Drexel, and they "turned it around in two years," she said.
"He would run the presses. He would write stories if needed be, he would sweep the floors, wash the windows, anything - he just wanted the place to run smoothly. And he gave his people benefits. Stuff like this was just not happening in the 1860s. But they got insurance and pensions and paid vacations. And my favorite thing, he paid the women at the same rate as the men."
The Inquirer, which competed with the Ledger until absorbing its Sunday and morning editions in 1934, wrote frequently about Childs. It was front-page news when he entertained a Spanish duke and duchess at his Radnor "country residence," Wootton, and when he traveled west on a visit to Denver. When he suffered an attack of "vertigo" - the stroke that would eventually kill him - The Inquirer, as well as the New York Times, posted prominent updates on his condition. Even Childs' 64th birthday rated a Page One mention.
Where did his collection go?
He hobnobbed with presidents and former presidents, including Ulysses S. Grant, but his closest friend appears to have been Anthony Drexel, who named one of his sons George W. Childs Drexel.
And after the older Drexel founded the Drexel Institute - now Drexel University - in 1891, Childs or his widow donated much of his collection to the school, including the Poe and Dickens manuscripts and David Rittenhouse's Astronomical Musical Clock.
With Drexel they would remain until the 1940s, when the school began to look into liquidating some of its collections, triggering an outcry from alumni, teachers, and students.
In January 1944, Drexel's president, George P. Rea, demanded to see the school's student newspaper's story on the proposed sale "for censorship," reported The Inquirer. A few months later, Rea resigned, and the paper quoted his denial that it was tied to "the attempt to dispose of such institute treasures as the Rittenhouse clock and the original manuscript of Poe's 'Murders in the Rue Morgue.' "
Sometimes called "the most important clock in America," the Rittenhouse timepiece remains at Drexel today. The manuscripts, however, were put on the block, with "Rue Morgue" fetching $34,000. Sold to Charles Sessler, a Philadelphia collector and dealer, it became part of the collection of Richard Gimbel.
Gimbel, the grandson of the founder of the old Gimbels department stores, was a fan of Poe's and had bought the writer's former home on Seventh Street. (It's now operated by the National Park Service as the Edgar Allan Poe National Historic Site.) After Gimbel died in 1970, his Poe collection, along with the house, went to the Free Library.
So that's where Poe ended up.
"It's definitely a point of pride because there is not a lot of Poe material like the manuscript out there," said Janine Pollock, chief of the Free Library's special collections division. The title page, which shows that the writer crossed out part of the original title, changing "Rue Trianon-Bas" to the spookier "Rue Morgue," is somewhat faded, so it's not on permanent display. But you can still see it: Reservations to see the manuscript can be made through the library's Rare Book Department: 215-686-5416 or erefrbd@freelibrary.org.
What about the Dickens?
Dickens' manuscript, whose $17,000 sale was hailed by The Inquirer as " 'Our Mutual Friend' Comes Back to City," did not remain long in Philadelphia after its reported purchase by Philadelphia art dealer and book collector A.S.W. Rosenbach.
But Rosenbach was only the intermediary, said Elizabeth E. Fuller, librarian at the Rosenbach, which houses the collections of Rosenbach and his brother, Philip. The real buyer was New York's Morgan Library.
"Rosenbach got the headlines for the record prices he set by skillful bidding regardless of whose money he was doing it with, and reporters sought him out because [they] knew they'd get good copy from him whether or not he talked about the purchaser, because he was also good at explaining the objects themselves - why they were interesting and important enough to be worth such prices."
His possessions may have scattered, but the late Mr. Childs is easy enough to find. Laurel Hill Cemetery is open 365 days a year, from 7 a.m.-5 p.m. between Nov. 1 and April 30, and from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. the rest of the year. Free maps are available, as are free mobile apps for Apple and Android. Private tours may be arranged through the cemetery's website: thelaurehillcemetery.org.

Texto completo: We should have guessed that something was wrong when Warren Beatty strolled out just before midnight, with Faye Dunaway on his arm, and announced to the world that La La Land was the winner of the Democrats' 2020 Iowa caucus.
OK, that was obviously a lame joke. The reality is that if you tuned into the overcaffeinated TV coverage of Iowa in the middle of the night, absolutely nothing was happening - a jaw-dropping political disaster that was probably a relief to Howard Dean, whose 2004 scream will never again be cited as the worst political thing to ever happen in the Hawkeye State.
The Iowa Democrats' epic fail - as I write this, 16 hours after the caucus doors closed, no official results have been reported, in a contest that consumed tens of millions of dollars and many hours of TV airtime - feels both unprecedented and yet weirdly inevitable. Already in this first and supposedly most important contest in the choosing of a Democrat to challenge President Donald Trump in November, the New York Times had endorsed not one but two candidates, the major preelection poll was canceled because of one complaining Pete Buttigieg voter, and the electorate seemed paralyzed by fear of picking a candidate who would become prey for America's bully-in-chief. A night with tens of thousands of voters and no results seems fitting.
One could make the case that what happened in Iowa on Monday was embarrassing but almost funny, and no big deal - soon to be forgotten by a nation where the 24-hour news cycle's been condensed to about 51 minutes. The results will be posted any day now - any day now - and the candidates have given their bizarre 1 a.m. victory-no-really speeches and moved to New Hampshire, where the votes may actually be counted.
But Monday night was no laughing matter. Iowa's Indecision 2020 happened to occur right in the middle of the biggest legitimacy crisis for American democracy since the Civil War. Just three days earlier in Washington, a majority of 51 Republican senators voted to shut down Trump's impeachment trial and boost the notion that it's no big deal when a U.S. president abuses the power of his office, even when it's to cheat in his own election. Now comes Iowa to pour ethanol-based gasoline on America's fire.
We have lost all faith in the very foundation of the American Experiment - our elections. That has made it easy and, frankly, understandable for conspiracy theories to flourish online, which is exactly what happened this calamitous February night. Even the Trump family had the nerve to claim the caucuses were "rigged." Russia, are you listening to this nonsense?
I don't know what's going to happen in a so-far dreadful 2020, but if we start now, we can start to bring back government by the people in time for 2024. Here's how:
Kill the Iowa caucuses. Iowa is a wonderful state (some of my ancestors farmed there) with many Midwestern Nice folks who take their democracy seriously, but it's time for its half-century in the political sun to end. A caucus system does lend an aura of Our Town participatory democracy, but the reality is that - even in such a politicized era - turnout is dismal, typically less than a third of New Hampshire's primary voting rate a week later.
And as frustrated ex-candidate Julin Castro and many others have also stressed, Iowa's current status gives too much weight to a state where 90% of Democrats are white and thus not reflective of the party's diversity.
Overhaul the primary system. The death of the Iowa caucus as a first-in-the-nation endurance test is the perfect excuse for some tough love in radically overhauling a crazy, patchwork system that has become too messy, too expensive, and way too long. A series of weekly regional primaries, rotated in their order every election cycle, would give a bigger say to more, and more diverse, voters.
Fix election security. The unconscionable ability of freedom-crushing Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to thwart any and all election-security bills coming out of the Democratic-controlled House needs to become a four-alarm fire, with the media and voters screaming for something to be done. What happened in Iowa should be the death knell for any voting system that relies on vulnerable technology and doesn't have a paper backup.
Starting from scratch in 2020, would a majority of the American people support an ancient idea like the Electoral College or a Senate, where the vote of a citizen from Wyoming counts 67 times as much as that of a citizen from California? I don't think so. Nor does it make sense for two mostly white states, Iowa and now New Hampshire, to winnow the Democratic field and force out good candidates like Castro and Sens. Kamala Harris and Cory Booker before voting even starts.
This week, let's count every vote from Monday night's Iowa caucus, and then quickly kill it, for good, so it can never hurt our democracy again.

Texto completo: FIRST, HE WAS convicted of killing his wife.
Now, Jonathan Nyce, a 70-year-old former pharmaceuticals executive, faces charges of scamming money off the owners of dying dogs.
In an indictment unsealed Tuesday, federal prosecutors accused Nyce, of Collegeville, of bilking desperate pet owners online by selling unapproved drugs he claimed were capable of curing canine cancer.
The new charges come 16 years after he was convicted of beating his wife to death in the garage of their Hopewell Township, N.J., home - a 2004 case that became a true-crime tabloid sensation.
Investigators believe Nyce began his alleged pet-meds scam shortly after his release from an eight-year prison sentence. Marketing his product under the names "Tumexal" and "Naturasone," he allegedly bilked pet owners out of hundreds of thousands of dollars by claiming his medicines could treat "a wide variety of cancers" and restore the ailing pets' "appetite, spirit and energy."
In reality, prosecutors said, the drugs Nyce peddled had not been FDA-approved and were nothing more than a collection of bulk ingredients he mixed at a facility in Collegeville.
Nyce allegedly charged others for access to clinical trials he claimed he was running for other promising treatments. One woman from Illinois, referenced in the indictment, handed Nyce more than $5,000.
U.S. Attorney William M. McSwain called the new accusations against Nyce "shameful" and accused him of taking advantage of nurturing pet owners "doing everything they [could] to keep their beloved pets alive and well."
"That is both cruel and illegal, and now the defendant will face the consequences," he said in a statement.
Nyce is expected to surrender to authorities in the next several days on charges including wire fraud and selling misbranded drugs, a spokesperson for the U.S. Attorney's Office said. Nyce could not be reached for comment Tuesday and it was unclear whether he had retained an attorney.
But Nyce has repeatedly maintained his innocence in the case that first drew him into the public spotlight - including in his 2012 book titled Under Color of Law, which he describes on the dust jacket as a "fact-driven account of an innocent man's nightmare journey through the American criminal justice system."
The 2004 murder of Michelle Rivera Nyce drew national headlines as much for where it took place - a 21-room, 5,600-square-foot McMansion in a tony section of Hopewell Township - as for the high profile of the accused killer.
Nyce, a Temple University graduate and an East Carolina University professor, founded the pharmaceutical firm EpiGenesis and had attracted millions of investor dollars in the '90s for an asthma drug he was developing
He was introduced to Michelle in 1989 after responding to a newspaper ad offering to connect American men with women from the Philippines. She eventually immigrated to the United States, married Nyce, and took a job at the Chanel counter at the Quaker Bridge Mall.
But when Nyce learned she was having an affair with their landscaper in 2004, he confronted her as she returned home one night from one of their trysts. He slammed her head into the floor of their garage, killing her and leaving their home covered in blood.
Nyce panicked after the slaying, investigators testified at his trial. He stuffed his wife behind the wheel of a Land Rover and somehow drove it through their upscale neighborhood using an 18-inch ice pick to press the pedals from the passenger's seat. Eventually, he drove the car off a six-foot drop and into an icy creek bank.
Superior Court found Nyce guilty of passion/provocation manslaughter, a lesser crime than the original charge of murder, and sentenced him to eight years in prison.
Despite the notoriety his case drew, Nyce and his then-attorney, Robin Lord, always maintained that prosecutors had it all wrong.
"If he really wanted to kill his wife," she said in a 2005 interview with the New York Times, "he could have designed a drug to do it."

EPIC FAIL IN IOWA

Texto completo: WE SHOULD HAVE guessed that something was wrong when Warren Beatty strolled out just before midnight, with Faye Dunaway on his arm, and announced to the world that La La Land was the winner of the Democrats' 2020 Iowa Caucus.
OK, that was obviously a lame joke. The reality is that if you tuned into the overcaffeinated TV coverage of Iowa in the middle of the night, absolutely nothing was happening - in a jaw-dropping political disaster that was probably a relief to Howard Dean, whose 2004 scream will never again be cited as the worst political thing to ever happen in the Hawkeye State.
The Iowa Democrats' epic fail - as I write this, 16 hours after the caucus doors closed, no official results have been reported, in a contest that consumed tens of millions of dollars and many hours of TV airtime - feels both unprecedented and yet weirdly inevitable. Already in this first and supposedly most important contest in the choosing of a Democrat to challenge President Trump in November, the New York Times had endorsed not one but two candidates, the major preelection poll was canceled because of one complaining Pete Buttigieg voter, and the electorate seemed paralyzed by fear of picking a candidate who'd become prey for America's bully-in-chief. A night with tens of thousands of voters and no results seems fitting.
One could make the case that what happened in Iowa on Monday was embarrassing but almost funny, and no big deal - soon to be forgotten by a nation where the 24-hour news cycle's been condensed to about 51 minutes. The results will be posted any day now - any day now - and the candidates have given their bizarre 1 a.m. victory-no-really speeches and moved into New Hampshire, where the votes may actually be counted.
But Monday night was no laughing matter. Iowa's Indecision 2020 happened to occur right in the middle of the biggest legitimacy crisis for American democracy since the Civil War. Just three days earlier in Washington, a majority of 51 Republican senators voted to shut down Trump's impeachment trial and boost the notion that it's no big deal when a U.S. president abuses the power of his office, even when it's to cheat in his own election. Now comes Iowa to pour ethanol-based gasoline on America's fire.
We have lost all faith in the very foundation of the American Experiment - our elections. That has made it easy and, frankly, understandable for conspiracy theories to flourish online, which is exactly what happened this calamitous February night. Even the Trump family had the nerve to claim the caucuses were "rigged." Russia, are you listening to this nonsense?
I don't know what's going to happen in a so-far dreadful 2020, but if we start now, we can start to bring back government by the people in time for 2024. Here's how:

Texto completo: Victor Gregory Laties, Ph.D.
Victor Gregory Laties, Ph.D., died on February 3, 2020, the day after his palindromic 94th birthday of 02/02/2020. He was an important figure in the development of behavioral pharmacology and behavioral toxicology over the final four decades of the 20th century. Victor's contributions to these fields is reflected in his nearly 100 publications - journal articles, book chapters, collections of essays, etc. published between 1958 and 2011.
Born in Racine, Wisconsin, and raised in Peabody, Massachusetts, Victor received his undergraduate degree from Tufts University (1949), and his Ph.D. in psychology from the University of Rochester (1954). He spent a post-doctoral year (1954/55) as a Ford Foundation teaching intern at Brown University, where he developed his life-long interest in behavior analysis. In 1955 Victor joined the faculty at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine and in 1965 moved to the University of Rochester School of Medicine & Dentistry in Rochester, N.Y. He formally retired as professor of environmental medicine, psychology and pharmacology in 1993, though he remained active in behavioral analysis and in scientific publishing.
Victor was very active in the Society for the Experimental Analysis of Behavior, serving several terms on its board and editing and publishing the Society's two periodicals. He was on the board of editors of the Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior (JEAB) from 1962 to 1966, served as executive editor from 1966, and edited the journal from 1973 to 1976. He was also executive editor of the Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis (JABA) from 1966 to 2014.
Victor also served on the editorial boards of the Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics (1965-71), Psychopharmacology (1968-78, 1981-89), The Behavior Analyst (1980-82), and Experimental and Clinical Psychopharmacology (1992-98). He was a member of advisory and research review committees for the National Institutes of Health, the National Academy of Sciences, the National Library of Medicine, the American Public Health Association, the Environmental Protection Agency, and other organizations. He was a fellow of the American Psychological Association from 1953 and served the association in several leadership roles.
Victor had an active, witty intellect and a roving curiosity. He could not pass a bookstore without going in and coming out with an armload of books. He was fascinated with 20th Century printmaking and collected etchings, woodcuts and lithographs. He listened to and read from a wide variety of news sources and felt naked without a New York Times under his arm. He loved big band and piano jazz. London was his favorite place, and he loved to prowl used bookstores there searching for antique maps and guidebooks.
A loving husband, father of three, and grandfather of eight, Victor took great joy in his family and delighted in finding previously unknown relatives. Whenever he traveled he visited whatever distant relations lived nearby and once went so far as to crash a cousin's wedding. He and his brothers facilitated the immigration of many cousins from Russia to the United States.
Victor loved taking photographs, especially of family, friends and colleagues. His most distinctive personal trait was the joy he took in everyday life and in his companions. He sang, hummed, be-bopped and danced, both alone and with family and friends.
Victor is survived by his wife, Martha Fisher Laties, three children: Nancy Feresten (Tim), Andy Laties (Rebecca) and Claire Davis (Ty), his brothers Alan Laties (Deena) and David Laties, as well as by 7 grandchildren: Dashiell Davis (Stacy), Abigail Feresten (Adrian), Sarah Laties, Duncan Davis (Jackclyn), Douglas Davis, Becklin Davis, and Darcy Davis. Brother George Laties and grandson Samuel Laties predeceased him.

Texto completo: Perhaps they shouldn't have risked driving to the Canadian border in such a dilapidated vehicle, but there they were -- stuck in the woods with a truck that wouldn't start.
Jim Wynne knew they were too remote for a tow. And as he struggled under the hood with a series of fixes that didn't work, the anger and the cursing surged.
"You just give it too much energy, man," advised Wynne's traveling companion, Takashi Yoshino, who was serenely watching from atop a nearby boulder.
The feedback struck a nerve.
"Now, I want to kill him," Wynne recalled. "I'm throwing things all over. I had to walk away from him because I was so frustrated. And as I walked away to collect myself, I realized: He was so right. … I calmed down, and I did what I needed to do, and I got the vehicle running."
"He always had that peace of mind about him -- if you stay calm and you stay relaxed, you can find your way through anything."
Yoshino led hundreds of clients toward recovery through decades of work at chemical dependency treatment centers in the Twin Cities.
He died on Jan. 11 from complications of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. He was 71. Colleagues and former clients recalled Yoshino's equanimity as he peacefully guided people through the rigors of recovery while also facing significant personal challenges. A cancer diagnosis more than a decade ago brought help from the late New York Times media critic David Carr.
"He was a beacon and a role model for people seeking and achieving early recovery," said Dan Cain, the longtime president of RS Eden, a social services group that includes a treatment center in Minneapolis called Eden House.
Yoshino was born in Minneapolis and attended high school here, after spending some of his childhood in Hawaii. Wynne, his longtime friend and colleague, said they both got into counseling after having been addicts who found sobriety and wanted to help others.
Yoshino found help at Eden House, a center that focuses on clients who often have a history with the criminal justice system and life on the streets. He went on to become a counselor at Eden House for more than a decade, before moving to other treatment centers.
"It's so critical to be able to be empathetic for [the clients], because they don't feel very good about themselves," said Wynne, who currently works at Eden House. "No addict does, but the kind of addict that we work with -- it's being reinforced at a societal level, that we're not worthwhile and that we are the problems of society. …
"That was one thing that Tak was so skillful at," Wynne said. "He could make anybody sitting with him feel important. He could make anyone sitting with him feel love."
Carr, who was a longtime journalist in the Twin Cities before working in New York, met Yoshino at Eden House. In his 2008 memoir "The Night of the Gun," Carr wrote about a fishing trip that clients and staff took to the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness.
"A very rough, remarkably urban crowd was loaded into vans for the long trip from Minneapolis, along with axes, filet knives and handsaws," Carr wrote. " 'What could go wrong?' said Tak, one of the clients who organized the trip, as he surveyed all the lethal hardware."
Carr related a conversation years later when he asked Yoshino whether clients "were just gimped in some fundamental way, or if the drugs created a kind of temporary mania that was now behind us?" Yoshino replied: "We did what we did, and we each brought something to the table when we got involved with chemicals."
Yoshino is survived by his wife, seven children, a sister and a brother. Services have been held.

Texto completo: Celebrated poet and public intellectual Claudia Rankine did not intend to write "The White Card," her unflinching exploration of white supremacy and privilege in a liberal art world family.
The catalyst for the play, which opens Thursday at Penumbra Theatre in St. Paul, was a well-meaning but loaded question the MacArthur Foundation "genius" was asked a couple of years ago after reading from her critically acclaimed multigenre collection, "Citizen: An American Lyric."
A white man stood up and asked, "What can I do for you?" turning the traumatic bigotry she had written so lucidly about into a personal problem that he may be able to solve. Rankine turned the question back on him, asking, "What can you do for you?"
"[James] Baldwin said white people tried to civilize black people before civilizing themselves," said Rankine, a Yale University professor whose works are published by Minneapolis-based Graywolf Press. "When somebody who has just told you that they love your work and felt impelled to leave their house to come hear you talk, then turns and asks, 'What can I do for you?' you see that this idea of a white savior remains in his psyche."
The question "presumes not just superiority but innocence," Rankine said. "I think, on a certain level, he had a desire to make something better. We are who we are, despite our best intentions."
Rankine dealt with the incident the way she processes many of her experiences -- by turning them into art. "The White Card" uses the format of a dinner
party to vent issues that have been raised only fitfully in a nation that has not yet reconciled with its history.
Wealthy white Manhattan art collectors Charles and Virginia Spencer host the shindig in honor of rising black artist Charlotte. The Spencers' undergraduate son, Alex, and their art dealer, Eric, also are present. After good food and bon mots, things get real.
Rankine sees the play as an opportunity for stand-ins for herself and her questioner to try again.
"The dinner conversation as a form allows people to be in the same reality," she said. "One of the things that's striking to me is I could have gone to the same college with someone, spent an amazing amount of time with them in grad school, yet my knowledge of American history is very different from theirs. When we try to speak to each other, we are working from different ideas. What if we are in agreement about the facts?"
Critical race thinker
Rankine is taking critical race theory, the area of study that examines how racial categories are constructed and maintained as part of societal power structures, out into the world. In addition to writings, readings and plays, she collaborates with other artists, including her husband, filmmaker John Lucas, who is white, on documentaries on the subject. And she has used some of the $625,000 of her 2016 MacArthur award to fund the Racial Imaginary Institute, a roving think tank.
"Claudia's vision is transformative as she deals with cultural issues that have been with us since the country's inception," said Graywolf Executive Editor Jeff Shotts. "The crisis we're in with nationalism, tribalism and white supremacy didn't start with the 2016 election. Sometimes the volcano is dormant. But Claudia's work helps us to see the whole picture with clarity."
That clarity includes surfacing things that we carry as a nation in our subconscious and seem to be far removed from a rarefied, pristine realm such as the art world. Slavery, a dominant feature of American society for centuries, arises in "White Card" in conversations about commerce, black bodies and Christianity.
"The idea of Christian sacrifice and capitalism go hand in hand," Rankine said. She pointed out that slavery gave way to Jim Crow to mass incarceration. "The structure is inhumane and barbaric, but it remains the structure we're in."
Silent witnessing
The audience sat on both sides of the action at the 2018 premiere of "The White Card" in Boston. That setup is not possible at Penumbra, which has a shallow thrust stage.
"But what we've done is to remove some rows of seats," said director Talvin Wilks, known for his palpable, intelligent shows. Wilks has been wrestling with how to make some of the archetypal characters human. "You want to avoid stereotypes or too many ideas, which lead to audience shutdown."
"White Card" has one black character onstage surrounded by four white ones. That's not something one expects from a theater that Lou Bellamy and August Wilson built, said Jay Eisenberg, who plays Alex.
"For Penumbra, this is a little insane," Eisenberg said. "But you can't talk about blackness, a construct, without talking about whiteness."
The play is especially important for Minnesotans to see because while the state is progressive and forward-looking, it has some of the largest racial equity gaps in the country, according to a Star Tribune analysis of U.S. Census Bureau data.
The first transgender actor to play the role of Alex, Eisenberg is bringing a different element to the young, "woke" firebrand who sees himself as the ultimate ally of black causes.
"At Penumbra, we believe that the body matters, and I wanted to bring my whole self to the process," Eisenberg said. "For any white activist, especially one on the margins, you might feel that you can understand. But being able to show up in a realm is not the same as having unpacked privilege and power."
Playwright Rankine flies to the Twin Cities this week to see her show at Penumbra and will again hold talkbacks. Who knows what questions she may be asked?
Last year, Rankine wrote an essay for the New York Times Magazine called, "I wanted to know what white men thought about their privilege. So I asked."
That essay, which drew scads of comments, is included in "Just Us: An American Conversation," Rankine's newest book that will be published by Graywolf in September. It also sparked another Rankine work, "Help," which premieres March 10 in New York directed by Taibi Magar, who staged the production of "Noura" that's up at the Guthrie.
The show continues conversations from "The White Card."
"One of the things I learned is that these white men were upset that I think they have privilege," Rankine said. "Their idea of privilege was economic -- having a job at Goldman Sachs and driving a Maserati. And they're like, 'You're a professor at Yale who flies around in first class.' But my understanding of privilege has to do with being able to walk out the door without surveillance or fear, with being able to just live."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – It’s not over.
Though President Donald Trump was acquitted on two articles of impeachment Wednesday, a blizzard of criminal investigations, civil litigation and congressional inquiries still shadow him, his administration and his family business.
As House managers and the president’s lawyers clashed during the Senate impeachment trial last week, attorneys for a woman who accused Trump of raping her more than 20 years ago announced they seek a sample of Trump’s DNA.
The unusual request, tied to a defamation lawsuit filed by author and advice columnist E. Jean Carroll, is one of many battles awaiting Trump as he embarks on what promises to be one of the most contentious political contests in U. S. history.
"I don't think we've seen any politician, let alone a president, operate in this way," said David Weinstein, a former federal prosecutor in Miami. "I don't think we know where all of this goes. "
Republican strategists predicted the stain of impeachment would fade after Trump's acquittal.
"This has been like surviving an attempt on your political life," said Scott Jennings, a former aide to President George W. Bush. "It makes everything else, all of the remaining investigations and lawsuits, look relatively minor – like small paper cuts. "
The investigations and lawsuits, playing out against the backdrop of the 2020 presidential race, predate the issue at the heart of the impeachment trial – whether the president abused his power by withholding military aid to Ukraine to pressure the country to announce investigations into a political rival.
They could have far-reaching consequences for the balance of power between the executive and legislative branches.
Key moments: The Trump impeachment trial was historic. Here are some moments that made it memorable.
What's next: The trial is over; Trump won. Now get ready for the fallout.
Analysis: Tougher than Teflon? Trump shows he is the most resilient politician in modern US history
Fight over Trump’s finances reaches Supreme Court
Trump, who broke with decades of tradition by not releasing his tax returns when he ran for president, has taken the fight to keep them private all the way to the Supreme Court. It will hear arguments March 31, setting the stage for rulings in June.
The House Oversight and Reform Committee seeks eight years of Trump’s tax returns and other documents from Mazars USA, Trump’s longtime accounting firm. Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance seeks Trump’s financial records as part of a criminal investigation into hush money payments to two women who claimed they had affairs with Trump before he became president. Trump denied their allegations.
Tax returns: Supreme Court agrees to review Trump's efforts to keep his financial records secret
Two other Democrat-led House committees, Financial Services and Intelligence, subpoenaed Deutsche Bank and Capital One Financial for documents on Trump, his company and his three oldest children.
District and appeals judges ruled against Trump in those cases.
Reviewing the trial: What we learned (and still don't know) after the Trump impeachment saga
'We're not going anywhere'
Remnants of the 2016 presidential election linger as federal prosecutors in California and New York examine the fundraising of Trump's inaugural committee.
As part of that far-flung inquiry, California-based venture capitalist Imaad Zuberi was charged in January with obstructing an investigation into the source of a $900,000 contribution to the committee.
In a separate action, District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine sued the inaugural committee, alleging the organization overpaid for space at Trump's hotel in Washington, resulting in a benefit to the Trump family business. The committee paid the hotel more than $1 million for event space and food during a four-day period.
Racine said he has no intention of abandoning his effort to recoup the money.
"We're going to stick it out, man," Racine said in an interview with USA TODAY. "We're not going anywhere. "

Battle over Mueller investigation continues
The House Judiciary Committee has not given up its fight to hear from Donald McGahn, a witness in special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russia’s interference in the 2016 election, and to see grand jury evidence from that probe.
Mueller’s report described multiple instances in which Trump sought to thwart the investigation. McGahn told investigators Trump ordered him to remove Mueller.
McGahn defied the committee's subpoena to testify, claiming he could not be forced to appear because he was a close presidential adviser.
A federal appeals court in the District of Columbia has been weighing whether McGahn can be forced to testify. During a hearing in January, House lawyers said the president faced the prospect of new articles of impeachment if the administration continues to block McGahn's testimony.
The Justice Department argued the courts should not compel McGahn to testify and to force the administration to disclose secret testimony. The Trump administration's objections were met with deep skepticism from some members of the court.
“Has there ever been an instance of such a broad scale of defiance of Congress?” Judge Thomas Griffith asked Justice Department lawyer Hashim Mooppan last month, referring to the Trump administration's refusal to cooperate with the House impeachment inquiry.
The D. C. appeals court is likely to render separate decisions on McGahn's testimony and the grand jury evidence.
'Food fight' or congressional oversight? Appeals court weighs whether to enforce subpoenas issued in impeachment inquiry
Rudy Giuliani, Trump's personal attorney, was the president's most aggressive advocate during the Mueller probe. He is the subject of a criminal investigation by federal prosecutors – the same office Giuliani headed as the Manhattan U. S. attorney before he became New York City mayor in 1993.
The investigation focuses in part on Giuliani's work with Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman. The Soviet-born business associates worked with Giuliani to seek information in Ukraine that could damage Joe Biden, the former U. S. vice president vying to challenge Trump in the 2020 presidential election.
Trump opponents: Protests planned nationwide after expected impeachment acquittal
Questions on Trump’s financial entanglements linger
Questions remain about whether Trump violated a once-obscure constitutional provision that prohibits presidents from accepting money from foreign governments.
Lawsuits over the Emoluments Clause, which Trump derided as "phony," made their way through federal courts in Washington and two states.
The question is whether Trump's financial stake in hotels and restaurants, which cater to foreign and domestic customers with interests in the government Trump leads, violate the Constitution. After he became president, Trump turned over day-to-day control of the Trump Organization to his eldest sons, but he still owns the business.
Trump's family business has drawn the scrutiny of New York's attorney general. Investigators subpoenaed records related to the financing of four major Trump Organization projects, The New York Times reported.
The investigation was prompted by congressional testimony from Michael Cohen, Trump's former personal attorney, who said Trump inflated his assets in financial statements.
Emoluments: Trump's profits from private businesses to get hard look from federal appeals courts
“There’s still going to be lingering questions about what the president’s financial entanglements are and whether he’s motivated by financial connections and business interests around the world,” said Deepak Gupta, a Washington lawyer handling two Emoluments cases against Trump.
“We know that foreign governments are patronizing his businesses," he said, "and that is an easy way for foreign officials to line the president’s pockets. ”
Upsetting the balance of power
Republican strategist Ron Bonjean suggested Trump's acquittal could deprive Democrats of political momentum to continue congressional investigations.
"We're likely going to see the White House saying that the House investigations are continuing to be an extremely political vendetta organized by the Democratic leadership to affect the 2020 elections, instead of getting the real work done for the American people," Bonjean said.
The impeachment proceedings haven't made a dent in Trump's political base, Bonjean said, and his supporters will continue to see the investigations as a waste of time.
"They'll say, 'Here we go again,' " Bonjean said. "By and large, (Trump's supporters) really buy into the fact that this is a political process. "
Democratic strategist Simon Rosenberg, who runs the National Democrat Network think tank, said walking away from the pending investigations isn't an option.
"I don't think there's going to be any let-up on accountability. The House has a constitutional responsibility to check the executive" branch, said Rosenberg, a senior adviser to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in 2018.
The White House repeatedly defied congressional subpoenas during various investigations and the impeachment inquiry, which could expand the power of the executive branch and weaken Congress.
"How does the government function if the balance of power between the executive and the legislative has been altered? How do we move forward?" Rosenberg said.
As divisions between the two parties are deeper than ever, he said he doesn't have an answer.

Physicians Are Using A Wildly Popular Short-form Video App To Battle Medical Misinformation

Texto completo: For decades, sex education in the classroom could be pretty cringey. For some adolescents, it meant a pitch for abstinence; others watched their teachers put condoms on bananas and attempt sketches of fallopian tubes that looked more like modern art.
On TikTok, sex ed is being flipped on its head. Teenagers who load the app might find guidance set to the pulsing beat of “Sex Talk” by Megan Thee Stallion.
A doctor, sporting scrubs and grinning into her camera, instructs them on how to respond if a condom breaks during sex: The pill Plan B can be 95% effective, the video explains.
The video is the work of Dr. Danielle Jones, a gynecologist in College Station, Texas, and so far has racked up over 11 million views. Comments range from effusive (“this slaps”) to eye-rolling (“thanks for the advice mom” and “ma’am, I’m 14 years old”).
“My TikTok presence is like if you had a friend who just happens to be an OB-GYN,” Jones said. “It’s a good way to give information to people who need it and meet them where they are.”
Jones is one of many medical professionals working their way through the rapidly expanding territory of TikTok, the Chinese-owned short-form video app, to counter medical misinformation to a surging audience. The app has been downloaded 1.5 billion times as of November, according to SensorTower, with an audience that skews young: 40% of its users are ages 16 to 24.
Adapting to change
Although medical professionals have long taken to social media to share healthy messages or promote their work, TikTok poses a new set of challenges, even for the internet adept. Popular posts on the app tend to be short, musical and humorous, complicating the task of physicians hoping to share nuanced lessons on health issues like vaping, coronavirus, nutrition and things you shouldn’t dip in soy sauce. And some physicians who are using the platform to spread credible information have found themselves the targets of harassment.
Dr. Rose Marie Leslie, a family medicine resident physician at the University of Minnesota Medical School, said TikTok provided an enormous platform for medical public service announcements.
“It has this incredible viewership potential that goes beyond just your own following,” she said.
Leslie’s TikToks on vaping-associated lung diseases drew over 3 million views, and posts on the flu and HPV vaccines also reached broad audiences beyond her hospital.
Striking a chord on TikTok, Leslie said, means tailoring medical messaging to the app’s often goofy form. In one post, she advised viewers to burn calories by practicing a viral TikTok dance. She takes her cues from teen users, who often use the app to offer irreverent, even slapstick commentary on public health conversations. She noted one trend in which young TikTokers brainstormed creative ways to destroy your e-cigarette, like running it over with a car.
TikTok’s executives have welcomed the platform’s uses for medical professionals. “It’s been inspiring to see doctors and nurses take to TikTok in their scrubs to demystify the medical profession,” said Gregory Justice, TikTok’s head of content programming.
Jones, the gynecologist, said she was hopeful the platform could help young people develop trust in medical practitioners and view them as more accessible. “Back in the old days, there was a town doctor and everyone knew where he lived, and you traded milk and eggs for health care,” Jones said. “You had trust in your doctor because you trusted them as a person first.” TikTok, she said, can help to humanize doctors - she’s seen that some of her own patients feel more comfortable with her because they have seen her playful social media posts.
Unexpected results
But some doctors are also encountering responses to their videos that they did not expect.
Earlier this month, Dr. Nicole Baldwin, a pediatrician in Cincinnati, posted a TikTok listing the diseases that are preventable with vaccines and countering the notion that vaccines cause autism.
Her accounts on TikTok, Twitter, Facebook and Yelp were flooded with threatening comments, including one that labeled her “Public Enemy #1” and another that read, “Dead doctors don’t lie.”
A team of volunteers that is helping Baldwin monitor her social media has banned more than 5,200 users from her Facebook in recent weeks.
Baldwin said she started out feeling enthusiastic about the opportunity TikTok provides to educate adolescents, but her experience with harassment gave her some pause.
“There’s a fine line physicians are walking between trying to get a message out that will appeal to this younger generation without being inappropriate or unprofessional,” Baldwin said. “Because of the short content and musical aspect of TikTok, what adolescents are latching onto is not the professional persona we typically put out there.”
A spate of recent TikToks have further stirred questions about the potential for the app’s abuse. One recent TikTok post featured a medical professional speculating - as she lip synced to the Rex Orange County lyric “How Could I Ignore You?” - that her patient’s chest pain could have been caused by cocaine. Another showed an emergency room doctor mocking patients who sought treatment in the ER rather than from a primary care physician.
Sarah Mojarad, a lecturer who teaches a course on social media for scientists at the University of Southern California, said she has seen physicians either “bashing their patients” on the app or “whitecoat marketing,” a term that refers to the use of medical prestige to market inappropriate products like unauthorized supplements.
The youth of TikTok’s audience also raises the stakes when medical professionals misuse the platform.
“With a young audience, it’s really important to make sure that the content getting out is professional and accurate,” Mojarad said. “People may think some of it is medical humor, but it impacts care.”
TikTok’s community guidelines state that the platform does not permit “misinformation that may cause harm to an individual’s health, such as misleading information about medical treatments.” The company expanded its rules of conduct last month, as its user base has grown.
Some physicians worry that TikTok’s brief, playful clips can blur the line between general education and patient-specific medical advice.
Dr. Austin Chiang, a gastroenterologist and chief medical social media officer at Jefferson Health in Philadelphia, said he has been asked about specific symptoms on TikTok and has to refer users to established medical sources or directly to their doctors.
Dr. Christian Assad, a cardiologist in McAllen, Texas, said he sometimes scripts his TikToks, given the potential for confusion when he compresses a 60-minute talk on low-carbohydrate dieting into a 60-second musical clip.
Ignoring the platform isn’t an option, especially given the prevalence of disinformation on the app, Chiang said. Two of his more popular posts have countered the use of essential oils to cure diseases and exposed the failings of the celery juice fad diet.
“If we’re not there to be a voice for evidence-based medicine, who’s going to do that for us?” Chiang said. “Anti-vaxxers are already using social media to their advantage. By putting doctors on social media, we’re able to be a source of more accurate information.”
Cause for concern
Still, for doctors turned influencers, the TikTok learning curve can be steep. Dr. Matthew Schulman, a plastic surgeon in New York, said the slightly older users of Instagram and Snapchat have been vital to his private practice, helping to drive roughly 80% of consultations. He often streams live from the operating room. “Buttock augmentation is really popular on social media,” he said.
But TikTok has presented him with cause for additional concern. The virality upside is massive: A post he made earlier this month discussing celebrity clients drew more than 6.8 million views. But as he has watched his 10-year-old daughter use the app, he realized that he must exercise more caution in producing content.
“The demographic of TikTok is very young, and as a plastic surgeon I don’t feel comfortable marketing my services to children,” Schulman said. Simultaneously, he knows the app is growing fast. “I don’t want to be caught playing catch-up. In two or three years the platform could change, and if I already have an established account I’m ahead of the game.”
In the meantime, he said, he relies on top-notch TikTok editors - his kids.

Texto completo: “You fall pretty far on the progressive spectrum, right?” a New York Times reporter recently asked Pennsylvania Lt. Gov. John Fetterman.
“I don’t know,” Fetterman replied. “I fall on what I think is the fair spectrum on issues.”
That sound bite made me wonder why the fair spectrum is so controversial and why so many people are falling on the unfair spectrum.
“Fair” hasn’t yet become a dirty word, but all too often, right-wingers say it’s naïve and whiney to advocate for fairness.
“Who says life is fair?” they proclaim, mainly to justify unfairness.
The notable exception is when the rich and powerful cast themselves as victims who just need more money and power to improve the world. And when others on the right inexplicably agree with them.
I doubt anyone says they support bullying - hurting people through unfair use of power. But many people cheer when President Donald Trump does it.
“One citizen, one vote” sounds fair, but many politicians, including Pennsylvania Republicans, use gerrymandering to make their party’s votes count more than others. Meanwhile, GOP politicians in other states have disenfranchised voters to keep themselves in power.
We all say we want level playing fields. Still, there is a lot of union-bashing, even though collective bargaining gives workers a better shot at fair compensation and working conditions.
Fairness is a subject that could and has filled shelf after shelf of books, but here are other questions to consider:
Is it fair for children to grow up hungry and in dangerous neighborhoods because of their parents’ bad choices or, all too often, bad luck?
Is it fair to separate undocumented children from their parents and confine them in conditions far worse than what convicted killers face in prison?
Should politicians placate gun lobbyists rather than strengthen laws to protect innocent people from mass shooters?
Should rich businesses pay their workers so little that some of them must rely on government aid?
Should well-paid politicians give themselves raises while balking at increasing the minimum wage?
Should mega-corporations be able to pay little or no taxes while benefiting from taxpayer-supported infrastructure and services?
Is it fair that Pennsylvania taxes frackers by the number of wells they drill, not the massive amounts of natural gas they take out of the ground? Especially with the pollution, contamination and other environmental risks of fracking?
Should we let drug companies drive patients into bankruptcy because of the outrageous prices they charge, including for products with long-expired patents?
Should a religious group be able to force its views on everyone else, as in companies denying birth control coverage to employees or discriminating against gays and transgenders?
Is it fair that current and proposed laws would put abortion out of reach for financially strapped women but not those who could afford to go to another state?
Should the Trump administration and Republican congressmen and senators have blown up the national debt and deficit with tax cuts that mainly benefit the wealthy and big corporations?
Should the Trump administration have rolled back environmental regulations, allowing companies to pollute our air, water and soil?
Should any president be above the law? And should the senators in charge of his impeachment trial work hand-in-hand with that president for an acquittal, without even calling witnesses?
Or course, fairness is in the eye of the beholder. Slavery was widely tolerated 200 years ago. For decades after the Civil War, lynching was seen as an acceptable way to keep black people in line. Women fought for decades before finally getting the right to vote in 1920.
So OK, life has become fairer. But we still can and should do better.
P.S. - After my last column, someone speculated that John O’Hara might have liked Donald Trump if they’d been contemporaries. But which O’Hara? Which Trump?
O’Hara the Socialite might have enjoyed the antics of Trump the Celebrity. O’Hara the Outsider might have cheered Trump the Presidential Candidate’s surprise victories over GOP and Democratic establishment rivals.
But I doubt O’Hara the Clear-eyed Author would have refrained from depicting the arrogance, corruption and willful ignorance of President Trump - or his Senate enablers’ hypocrisy and lack of moral spine. It would’ve made a great novel.

Physicians Are Using A Wildly Popular Short-form Video App To Battle Medical Misinformation

Texto completo: For decades, sex education in the classroom could be pretty cringey. For some adolescents, it meant a pitch for abstinence; others watched their teachers put condoms on bananas and attempt sketches of fallopian tubes that looked more like modern art.
On TikTok, sex ed is being flipped on its head. Teenagers who load the app might find guidance set to the pulsing beat of “Sex Talk” by Megan Thee Stallion.
A doctor, sporting scrubs and grinning into her camera, instructs them on how to respond if a condom breaks during sex: The pill Plan B can be 95% effective, the video explains.
The video is the work of Dr. Danielle Jones, a gynecologist in College Station, Texas, and so far has racked up over 11 million views. Comments range from effusive (“this slaps”) to eye-rolling (“thanks for the advice mom” and “ma’am, I’m 14 years old”).
“My TikTok presence is like if you had a friend who just happens to be an OB-GYN,” Jones said. “It’s a good way to give information to people who need it and meet them where they are.”
Jones is one of many medical professionals working their way through the rapidly expanding territory of TikTok, the Chinese-owned short-form video app, to counter medical misinformation to a surging audience. The app has been downloaded 1.5 billion times as of November, according to SensorTower, with an audience that skews young: 40% of its users are ages 16 to 24.
Adapting to change
Although medical professionals have long taken to social media to share healthy messages or promote their work, TikTok poses a new set of challenges, even for the internet adept. Popular posts on the app tend to be short, musical and humorous, complicating the task of physicians hoping to share nuanced lessons on health issues like vaping, coronavirus, nutrition and things you shouldn’t dip in soy sauce. And some physicians who are using the platform to spread credible information have found themselves the targets of harassment.
Dr. Rose Marie Leslie, a family medicine resident physician at the University of Minnesota Medical School, said TikTok provided an enormous platform for medical public service announcements.
“It has this incredible viewership potential that goes beyond just your own following,” she said.
Leslie’s TikToks on vaping-associated lung diseases drew over 3 million views, and posts on the flu and HPV vaccines also reached broad audiences beyond her hospital.
Striking a chord on TikTok, Leslie said, means tailoring medical messaging to the app’s often goofy form. In one post, she advised viewers to burn calories by practicing a viral TikTok dance. She takes her cues from teen users, who often use the app to offer irreverent, even slapstick commentary on public health conversations. She noted one trend in which young TikTokers brainstormed creative ways to destroy your e-cigarette, like running it over with a car.
TikTok’s executives have welcomed the platform’s uses for medical professionals. “It’s been inspiring to see doctors and nurses take to TikTok in their scrubs to demystify the medical profession,” said Gregory Justice, TikTok’s head of content programming.
Jones, the gynecologist, said she was hopeful the platform could help young people develop trust in medical practitioners and view them as more accessible. “Back in the old days, there was a town doctor and everyone knew where he lived, and you traded milk and eggs for health care,” Jones said. “You had trust in your doctor because you trusted them as a person first.” TikTok, she said, can help to humanize doctors - she’s seen that some of her own patients feel more comfortable with her because they have seen her playful social media posts.
Unexpected results
But some doctors are also encountering responses to their videos that they did not expect.
Earlier this month, Dr. Nicole Baldwin, a pediatrician in Cincinnati, posted a TikTok listing the diseases that are preventable with vaccines and countering the notion that vaccines cause autism.
Her accounts on TikTok, Twitter, Facebook and Yelp were flooded with threatening comments, including one that labeled her “Public Enemy #1” and another that read, “Dead doctors don’t lie.”
A team of volunteers that is helping Baldwin monitor her social media has banned more than 5,200 users from her Facebook in recent weeks.
Baldwin said she started out feeling enthusiastic about the opportunity TikTok provides to educate adolescents, but her experience with harassment gave her some pause.
“There’s a fine line physicians are walking between trying to get a message out that will appeal to this younger generation without being inappropriate or unprofessional,” Baldwin said. “Because of the short content and musical aspect of TikTok, what adolescents are latching onto is not the professional persona we typically put out there.”
A spate of recent TikToks have further stirred questions about the potential for the app’s abuse. One recent TikTok post featured a medical professional speculating - as she lip synced to the Rex Orange County lyric “How Could I Ignore You?” - that her patient’s chest pain could have been caused by cocaine. Another showed an emergency room doctor mocking patients who sought treatment in the ER rather than from a primary care physician.
Sarah Mojarad, a lecturer who teaches a course on social media for scientists at the University of Southern California, said she has seen physicians either “bashing their patients” on the app or “whitecoat marketing,” a term that refers to the use of medical prestige to market inappropriate products like unauthorized supplements.
The youth of TikTok’s audience also raises the stakes when medical professionals misuse the platform.
“With a young audience, it’s really important to make sure that the content getting out is professional and accurate,” Mojarad said. “People may think some of it is medical humor, but it impacts care.”
TikTok’s community guidelines state that the platform does not permit “misinformation that may cause harm to an individual’s health, such as misleading information about medical treatments.” The company expanded its rules of conduct last month, as its user base has grown.
Some physicians worry that TikTok’s brief, playful clips can blur the line between general education and patient-specific medical advice.
Dr. Austin Chiang, a gastroenterologist and chief medical social media officer at Jefferson Health in Philadelphia, said he has been asked about specific symptoms on TikTok and has to refer users to established medical sources or directly to their doctors.
Dr. Christian Assad, a cardiologist in McAllen, Texas, said he sometimes scripts his TikToks, given the potential for confusion when he compresses a 60-minute talk on low-carbohydrate dieting into a 60-second musical clip.
Ignoring the platform isn’t an option, especially given the prevalence of disinformation on the app, Chiang said. Two of his more popular posts have countered the use of essential oils to cure diseases and exposed the failings of the celery juice fad diet.
“If we’re not there to be a voice for evidence-based medicine, who’s going to do that for us?” Chiang said. “Anti-vaxxers are already using social media to their advantage. By putting doctors on social media, we’re able to be a source of more accurate information.”
Cause for concern
Still, for doctors turned influencers, the TikTok learning curve can be steep. Dr. Matthew Schulman, a plastic surgeon in New York, said the slightly older users of Instagram and Snapchat have been vital to his private practice, helping to drive roughly 80% of consultations. He often streams live from the operating room. “Buttock augmentation is really popular on social media,” he said.
But TikTok has presented him with cause for additional concern. The virality upside is massive: A post he made earlier this month discussing celebrity clients drew more than 6.8 million views. But as he has watched his 10-year-old daughter use the app, he realized that he must exercise more caution in producing content.
“The demographic of TikTok is very young, and as a plastic surgeon I don’t feel comfortable marketing my services to children,” Schulman said. Simultaneously, he knows the app is growing fast. “I don’t want to be caught playing catch-up. In two or three years the platform could change, and if I already have an established account I’m ahead of the game.”
In the meantime, he said, he relies on top-notch TikTok editors - his kids.

Trump’s fate now in voters’ hands

Texto completo: A Times editorial

The U.S. Senate is poised to let voters decide the fate of a president who was elected with Russias help and then brazenly abused his power by seeking Ukraines assistance to win a second term. President Donald Trumps impeachment trial is expected to end today in acquittal, with Senate Republicans concluding his extortion scheme does not merit his removal from office. That gives an unrepentant Trump free rein to keep straining the ties that bind this democracy, and the November election will determine whether the president can put his interest ahead of the nations without fear of being held accountable.

One clear benefit of Trumps impeachment is that voters have greater knowledge of his willful manipulation of foreign policy to further his political fortunes at the expense of national security. House Democrats built a credible case in the impeachment trial, and while Senate Republicans closed their minds the impeachment should help voters decide whether Trump should serve a second term.

The facts are not in dispute. Trump withheld $391 million in military assistance to Ukraine and a White House meeting with its president in an attempt to force that country to announce an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden and his son. An anonymous whistleblowers account that triggered the Houses impeachment inquiry turned out to be on the mark, and the current and former members of the Trump administration who had the courage to defy the president and testify before the House were compelling.

Of course, it would have been more enlightening if Senate Republicans had allowed witnesses such as former national security adviser John Bolton to testify during the trial. But Sens. Marco Rubio, Rick Scott and the rest were not interested in conducting a fair trial, which will be the first impeachment trial in history not to include any witnesses. Voters will see a more complete picture.

Already, there are plenty of revelations outside the Senate trial to digest. Boltons unpublished book manuscript says Trump told him directly that he wanted to keep freezing the financial aid to Ukraine until officials there announced investigations into the Bidens. As Senate Republicans prepared last week to vote against hearing testimony from Bolton and others, the New York Times also reported Boltons book says Trump directed him to call the Ukraine president in May and encourage him to meet with the presidents personal lawyer, Rudolph Giuliani, who was pushing for the investigation into the Bidens. And hours after the Senate rejected hearing new evidence, the Justice Department acknowledged the existence of two dozen emails that could reveal Trumps views on blocking the aid to Ukraine and argued they should not be publicly released.

The facts that Republican senators refused to pursue will continue to come out. And while the Senate impeachment trial is expected to end today with Trumps acquittal, he will not be exonerated. He will forever be the third president in the nations history to be impeached and the first impeached president to be nominated for re-election. Unlike the Senate, voters will have an opportunity to evaluate all of the facts and determine whether he is fit to remain in office.

Resumen: The paper learned that, according to a yet-to-be-published tell-all book by President Donald Trump’s third national security adviser, John Bolton, Trump told Bolton to withhold military aid from Ukraine until the Eastern European nation helped dig up dirt on the Bidens. While some cable networks were breathless to report a development that they were sure would put more pressure on the GOP Senate to call witnesses in the Trump impeachment trial, others shrugged. The Senate confirmation hearings for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh offered a view of how the endless war of personal smears could defy common sense and still continue.

Texto completo: In the midst of the impeachment trial in the Senate, The New York Times had a big scoop. The paper learned that, according to a yet-to-be-published tell-all book by President Donald Trump’s third national security adviser, John Bolton, Trump told Bolton to withhold military aid from Ukraine until the Eastern European nation helped dig up dirt on the Bidens.
While some cable networks were breathless to report a development that they were sure would put more pressure on the GOP Senate to call witnesses in the Trump impeachment trial, others shrugged.
We already knew, after all, about the president’s July 25 phone call to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Trump later claimed it was a "perfect" call — which is absurd. It was wrong to delay aid to a vulnerable ally at war with Russia — and, worse, that Trump did so because he wanted Kyiv to do his campaign’s opposition research.
I am in the news business, and I’ve become immune to the drip, drip, drip of spoon-fed revelations. The Times reporters were reporting on what people who saw the manuscript told them what was in the manuscript. It’s like hearsay squared, and some of the more salacious details are likely to crumble.
Before Trump released a transcript of the July call, The Wall Street Journal had a scoop that Trump urged Zelenskiy to work with Trump’s private attorney Rudy Giuliani to find information damaging to the Bidens "about eight times" during the July call.
The transcript later revealed that Trump leaned on Zelenskiy, as Fox News’ Bret Baier figured, maybe three times "tangentially." But the inflated account — "eight times," cable pundits repeated — had fueled calls for impeachment.
The Senate confirmation hearings for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh offered a view of how the endless war of personal smears could defy common sense and still continue. Just as Kavanaugh was about to be confirmed, The Washington Post reported on a California woman who said Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her when they were both in high school.
She was so wounded; she didn’t want to be identified. But then, when she was needed as a witness to destroy his reputation, she reluctantly came forward. As did other women who claimed to be victims — and no matter how unsubstantiated or unbelievable their accusations were, these smears nonetheless found purchase in the campaign to destroy Kavanaugh’s reputation.
House managers have been indignant that Trump used vulnerable Ukraine for his own ends. In the next breath, they take umbrage at the very idea of asking Hunter Biden, who cashed in handsomely thanks to Ukraine’s entrenched cronyism, to tell his story. Sure, Hunter Biden has no information about the July 25 call. But he is living billboard for the Democrats’ double standard.
And really, D.C. Democrats always knew they wouldn’t have the 67 votes needed to remove Trump. But they did see an opportunity to take down the rare moderate Republican senator. Think Maine’s Susan Collins.
My prediction is that they damage their own brand in the process, just as Republicans paid a price for impeaching President Bill Clinton in 1998. At the end of the day, both efforts were wastes of time as well as bald exercises of partisan power to overturn the will of voters.
As a candidate, Trump promised to put a halt to "endless wars" that have mired U.S. troops in foreign hot spots. But as a president, he has stoked the "endless wars" of Beltway politics.
I remember the moment I read the transcript of the July 25 call. I was covering Trump at the U.N. General Assembly, where he finally sat down with Zelenskiy. I was appalled that Trump actually tried to get another country’s president to do his opposition research for him. And gobsmacked to realize that Trump did so during a conversation on which maybe 20 operatives — some who would not mind bringing him down — were listening in.
I don’t think for a minute that Senate Republicans didn’t find Trump’s recklessness appalling when Trump released the loose transcript. I say reckless not because the conversation could sink the country I love, but because it shows a leader who rarely considers how what he says can hurt the very people he needs to get things done.
Trump cannot claim that he won the impeachment battle, because, really, there are only losers in this saga.

Resumen: The paper learned that, according to a yet-to-be-published tell-all book by President Donald Trump’s third national security adviser, John Bolton, Trump told Bolton to withhold military aid from Ukraine until the Eastern European nation helped dig up dirt on the Bidens. While some cable networks were breathless to report a development that they were sure would put more pressure on the GOP Senate to call witnesses in the Trump impeachment trial, others shrugged. The Senate confirmation hearings for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh offered a view of how the endless war of personal smears could defy common sense and still continue.

Texto completo: In the midst of the impeachment trial in the Senate, The New York Times had a big scoop. The paper learned that, according to a yet-to-be-published tell-all book by President Donald Trump’s third national security adviser, John Bolton, Trump told Bolton to withhold military aid from Ukraine until the Eastern European nation helped dig up dirt on the Bidens.
While some cable networks were breathless to report a development that they were sure would put more pressure on the GOP Senate to call witnesses in the Trump impeachment trial, others shrugged.
We already knew, after all, about the president’s July 25 phone call to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Trump later claimed it was a "perfect" call — which is absurd. It was wrong to delay aid to a vulnerable ally at war with Russia — and, worse, that Trump did so because he wanted Kyiv to do his campaign’s opposition research.
I am in the news business, and I’ve become immune to the drip, drip, drip of spoon-fed revelations. The Times reporters were reporting on what people who saw the manuscript told them what was in the manuscript. It’s like hearsay squared, and some of the more salacious details are likely to crumble.
Before Trump released a transcript of the July call, The Wall Street Journal had a scoop that Trump urged Zelenskiy to work with Trump’s private attorney Rudy Giuliani to find information damaging to the Bidens "about eight times" during the July call.
The transcript later revealed that Trump leaned on Zelenskiy, as Fox News’ Bret Baier figured, maybe three times "tangentially." But the inflated account — "eight times," cable pundits repeated — had fueled calls for impeachment.
The Senate confirmation hearings for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh offered a view of how the endless war of personal smears could defy common sense and still continue. Just as Kavanaugh was about to be confirmed, The Washington Post reported on a California woman who said Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her when they were both in high school.
She was so wounded; she didn’t want to be identified. But then, when she was needed as a witness to destroy his reputation, she reluctantly came forward. As did other women who claimed to be victims — and no matter how unsubstantiated or unbelievable their accusations were, these smears nonetheless found purchase in the campaign to destroy Kavanaugh’s reputation.
House managers have been indignant that Trump used vulnerable Ukraine for his own ends. In the next breath, they take umbrage at the very idea of asking Hunter Biden, who cashed in handsomely thanks to Ukraine’s entrenched cronyism, to tell his story. Sure, Hunter Biden has no information about the July 25 call. But he is living billboard for the Democrats’ double standard.
And really, D.C. Democrats always knew they wouldn’t have the 67 votes needed to remove Trump. But they did see an opportunity to take down the rare moderate Republican senator. Think Maine’s Susan Collins.
My prediction is that they damage their own brand in the process, just as Republicans paid a price for impeaching President Bill Clinton in 1998. At the end of the day, both efforts were wastes of time as well as bald exercises of partisan power to overturn the will of voters.
As a candidate, Trump promised to put a halt to "endless wars" that have mired U.S. troops in foreign hot spots. But as a president, he has stoked the "endless wars" of Beltway politics.
I remember the moment I read the transcript of the July 25 call. I was covering Trump at the U.N. General Assembly, where he finally sat down with Zelenskiy. I was appalled that Trump actually tried to get another country’s president to do his opposition research for him. And gobsmacked to realize that Trump did so during a conversation on which maybe 20 operatives — some who would not mind bringing him down — were listening in.
I don’t think for a minute that Senate Republicans didn’t find Trump’s recklessness appalling when Trump released the loose transcript. I say reckless not because the conversation could sink the country I love, but because it shows a leader who rarely considers how what he says can hurt the very people he needs to get things done.
Trump cannot claim that he won the impeachment battle, because, really, there are only losers in this saga.

Resumen: In other words, the U.S. should retaliate against Canada’s harming its citizens by forcing them to pay higher dairy product prices, by forcing Americans through tariffs to pay higher prices for wood and thereby raising the cost of building homes. Dr. Larry Summers, top economic adviser to President Obama, said about the Kobe, Japan, earthquake: "(The disaster) may lead to some temporary increments ironically to GDP as a process of rebuilding takes place. After devastating Floridian hurricanes, it’s not uncommon to read newspaper headlines such as "Storms create lucrative times," or "Economic growth from hurricanes could outweigh costs," or "It’s a perverse thing ... there’s real pain, but from an economic point of view, it is a plus."

Texto completo: I have been teaching economics since 1967 — 40 years of it at George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia. During that interval, economic reality has not changed. Just as Galileo’s law about the independent influence of gravity on falling objects has not changed, neither have the fundamental principles of economics. Economics is fun and simple. It’s made complicated by some economics professors — fortunately, not by my colleagues at George Mason University. Let’s apply some simple tools of economics to reveal outright myths, lies and tricks.
Who is punished by tariffs on imported goods? Let’s go through the steps. The Canadian government imposes high tariffs on American dairy imports. That forces Canadians to pay higher prices for dairy products and protects Canada’s dairy producers from American competition. What should be the U.S. government’s response to Canada’s hurting its citizens? If you were in the Trump administration, you might retaliate by imposing stiff tariffs on softwood products built from pine, spruce and fir trees used by U.S. homebuilders. In other words, the U.S. should retaliate against Canada’s harming its citizens by forcing them to pay higher dairy product prices, by forcing Americans through tariffs to pay higher prices for wood and thereby raising the cost of building homes.
Here’s a question: Are natural or man-made disasters good for the economy? Dr. Larry Summers, top economic adviser to President Obama, said about the Kobe, Japan, earthquake: "(The disaster) may lead to some temporary increments ironically to GDP as a process of rebuilding takes place. In the wake of the earlier Kobe earthquake, Japan actually gained some economic strength." After devastating Floridian hurricanes, it’s not uncommon to read newspaper headlines such as "Storms create lucrative times," or "Economic growth from hurricanes could outweigh costs," or "It’s a perverse thing ... there’s real pain, but from an economic point of view, it is a plus." Then there’s Nobel Laureate Paul Krugman who wrote in his New York Times column "After the Horror," after the 9/11 attack, "Ghastly as it may seem to say this, the terror attack — like the original day of infamy, which brought an end to the Great Depression — could do some economic good." He went on to explain that rebuilding the destruction would stimulate the economy through business investment and job creation.
One would never hear my colleagues in George Mason University’s economics department spouting such insanities. Just ask yourself whether the Japanese economy would have faced even greater opportunities for economic growth had the earthquake also struck Tokyo, Hiroshima, Yokohama and other major cities? Would the 9/11 terrorists have made a greater contribution to our economy had they also destroyed lives and buildings in Chicago, St. Louis, Los Angeles and Atlanta?
French economist Frederic Bastiat (1801-1850) explained it in his pamphlet "What is Seen and What is Not Seen." He said, "There is only one difference between a bad economist and a good one: the bad economist confines himself to the visible effect; the good economist takes into account both the effect that can be seen and those effects that must be foreseen." That’s why my George Mason University colleagues are good economists.

Many politicians, pundits and some economists would have us believe that corporations pay taxes, but do they? Economists distinguish between entities who ultimately bear the tax burden and those upon whom tax is initially levied. Just because a tax is levied on a corporation doesn’t mean that the corporation bears its burden. Faced with a tax, a corporation can shift the tax burden by raising its product prices, lowering dividends or laying off workers. The lesson here is that only people pay taxes, not legal fictions like corporations. Corporations are simply tax collectors for the government. Similarly, no one would fall for a politician telling a homeowner, "I’m not going to tax you; I’m going to tax your property." I guarantee that it will be a person, not the property, writing out the check to the taxing authority. Again, only people pay taxes.
Here’s a question: Are natural or man-made disasters good for the economy? Dr. Larry Summers, top economic adviser to President Obama, said about the Kobe, Japan, earthquake: "(The disaster) may lead to some temporary increments ironically to GDP as a process of rebuilding takes place.

Would the 9/11 terrorists have made a greater contribution to our economy had they also destroyed lives and buildings in Chicago, St. Louis, Los Angeles and Atlanta? The belief that a society benefits from destruction is sheer lunacy.
French economist Frederic Bastiat (1801-1850) explained it in his pamphlet "What is Seen and What is Not Seen." He said, "There is only one difference between a bad economist and a good one: the bad economist confines himself to the visible effect; the good economist takes into account both the effect that can be seen and those effects that must be foreseen." That’s why my George Mason University colleagues are good economists.

Resumen: In other words, the U.S. should retaliate against Canada’s harming its citizens by forcing them to pay higher dairy product prices, by forcing Americans through tariffs to pay higher prices for wood and thereby raising the cost of building homes. Dr. Larry Summers, top economic adviser to President Obama, said about the Kobe, Japan, earthquake: "(The disaster) may lead to some temporary increments ironically to GDP as a process of rebuilding takes place. After devastating Floridian hurricanes, it’s not uncommon to read newspaper headlines such as "Storms create lucrative times," or "Economic growth from hurricanes could outweigh costs," or "It’s a perverse thing ... there’s real pain, but from an economic point of view, it is a plus."

Texto completo: I have been teaching economics since 1967 — 40 years of it at George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia. During that interval, economic reality has not changed. Just as Galileo’s law about the independent influence of gravity on falling objects has not changed, neither have the fundamental principles of economics. Economics is fun and simple. It’s made complicated by some economics professors — fortunately, not by my colleagues at George Mason University. Let’s apply some simple tools of economics to reveal outright myths, lies and tricks.
Who is punished by tariffs on imported goods? Let’s go through the steps. The Canadian government imposes high tariffs on American dairy imports. That forces Canadians to pay higher prices for dairy products and protects Canada’s dairy producers from American competition. What should be the U.S. government’s response to Canada’s hurting its citizens? If you were in the Trump administration, you might retaliate by imposing stiff tariffs on softwood products built from pine, spruce and fir trees used by U.S. homebuilders. In other words, the U.S. should retaliate against Canada’s harming its citizens by forcing them to pay higher dairy product prices, by forcing Americans through tariffs to pay higher prices for wood and thereby raising the cost of building homes.
Here’s a question: Are natural or man-made disasters good for the economy? Dr. Larry Summers, top economic adviser to President Obama, said about the Kobe, Japan, earthquake: "(The disaster) may lead to some temporary increments ironically to GDP as a process of rebuilding takes place. In the wake of the earlier Kobe earthquake, Japan actually gained some economic strength." After devastating Floridian hurricanes, it’s not uncommon to read newspaper headlines such as "Storms create lucrative times," or "Economic growth from hurricanes could outweigh costs," or "It’s a perverse thing ... there’s real pain, but from an economic point of view, it is a plus." Then there’s Nobel Laureate Paul Krugman who wrote in his New York Times column "After the Horror," after the 9/11 attack, "Ghastly as it may seem to say this, the terror attack — like the original day of infamy, which brought an end to the Great Depression — could do some economic good." He went on to explain that rebuilding the destruction would stimulate the economy through business investment and job creation.
One would never hear my colleagues in George Mason University’s economics department spouting such insanities. Just ask yourself whether the Japanese economy would have faced even greater opportunities for economic growth had the earthquake also struck Tokyo, Hiroshima, Yokohama and other major cities? Would the 9/11 terrorists have made a greater contribution to our economy had they also destroyed lives and buildings in Chicago, St. Louis, Los Angeles and Atlanta?
French economist Frederic Bastiat (1801-1850) explained it in his pamphlet "What is Seen and What is Not Seen." He said, "There is only one difference between a bad economist and a good one: the bad economist confines himself to the visible effect; the good economist takes into account both the effect that can be seen and those effects that must be foreseen." That’s why my George Mason University colleagues are good economists.

There are only losers in this endless war of personal smears

Resumen: The paper learned that, according to a yet-to-be-published tell-all book by President Donald Trump’s third national security adviser, John Bolton, Trump told Bolton to withhold military aid from Ukraine until the Eastern European nation helped dig up dirt on the Bidens. While some cable networks were breathless to report a development that they were sure would put more pressure on the GOP Senate to call witnesses in the Trump impeachment trial, others shrugged. The Senate confirmation hearings for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh offered a view of how the endless war of personal smears could defy common sense and still continue.

Texto completo: In the midst of the impeachment trial in the Senate, The New York Times had a big scoop. The paper learned that, according to a yet-to-be-published tell-all book by President Donald Trump’s third national security adviser, John Bolton, Trump told Bolton to withhold military aid from Ukraine until the Eastern European nation helped dig up dirt on the Bidens.
While some cable networks were breathless to report a development that they were sure would put more pressure on the GOP Senate to call witnesses in the Trump impeachment trial, others shrugged.
We already knew, after all, about the president’s July 25 phone call to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Trump later claimed it was a "perfect" call — which is absurd. It was wrong to delay aid to a vulnerable ally at war with Russia — and, worse, that Trump did so because he wanted Kyiv to do his campaign’s opposition research.
I am in the news business, and I’ve become immune to the drip, drip, drip of spoon-fed revelations. The Times reporters were reporting on what people who saw the manuscript told them what was in the manuscript. It’s like hearsay squared, and some of the more salacious details are likely to crumble.
Before Trump released a transcript of the July call, The Wall Street Journal had a scoop that Trump urged Zelenskiy to work with Trump’s private attorney Rudy Giuliani to find information damaging to the Bidens "about eight times" during the July call.
The transcript later revealed that Trump leaned on Zelenskiy, as Fox News’ Bret Baier figured, maybe three times "tangentially." But the inflated account — "eight times," cable pundits repeated — had fueled calls for impeachment.
The Senate confirmation hearings for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh offered a view of how the endless war of personal smears could defy common sense and still continue. Just as Kavanaugh was about to be confirmed, The Washington Post reported on a California woman who said Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her when they were both in high school.
She was so wounded; she didn’t want to be identified. But then, when she was needed as a witness to destroy his reputation, she reluctantly came forward. As did other women who claimed to be victims — and no matter how unsubstantiated or unbelievable their accusations were, these smears nonetheless found purchase in the campaign to destroy Kavanaugh’s reputation.
House managers have been indignant that Trump used vulnerable Ukraine for his own ends. In the next breath, they take umbrage at the very idea of asking Hunter Biden, who cashed in handsomely thanks to Ukraine’s entrenched cronyism, to tell his story. Sure, Hunter Biden has no information about the July 25 call. But he is living billboard for the Democrats’ double standard.
And really, D.C. Democrats always knew they wouldn’t have the 67 votes needed to remove Trump. But they did see an opportunity to take down the rare moderate Republican senator. Think Maine’s Susan Collins.
My prediction is that they damage their own brand in the process, just as Republicans paid a price for impeaching President Bill Clinton in 1998. At the end of the day, both efforts were wastes of time as well as bald exercises of partisan power to overturn the will of voters.
As a candidate, Trump promised to put a halt to "endless wars" that have mired U.S. troops in foreign hot spots. But as a president, he has stoked the "endless wars" of Beltway politics.
I remember the moment I read the transcript of the July 25 call. I was covering Trump at the U.N. General Assembly, where he finally sat down with Zelenskiy. I was appalled that Trump actually tried to get another country’s president to do his opposition research for him. And gobsmacked to realize that Trump did so during a conversation on which maybe 20 operatives — some who would not mind bringing him down — were listening in.
I don’t think for a minute that Senate Republicans didn’t find Trump’s recklessness appalling when Trump released the loose transcript. I say reckless not because the conversation could sink the country I love, but because it shows a leader who rarely considers how what he says can hurt the very people he needs to get things done.
Trump cannot claim that he won the impeachment battle, because, really, there are only losers in this saga.

As did other women who claimed to be victims — and no matter how unsubstantiated or unbelievable their accusations were, these smears nonetheless found purchase in the campaign to destroy Kavanaugh’s reputation.
Somehow, as the Senate impeachment trial droned on, news organizations went to pains to report that Trump’s accusations about the Bidens were "debunked" or "discredited."
Yes, Trump was wrong to assert Vice President Joe Biden pushed Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor in 2015 to help his son, who was on the payroll of the Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma. The prosecutor wasn’t looking into Burisma at the time, and Biden was acting in concert with the international community and U.S. policy.
Biden frequently asserts that his son Hunter "did nothing wrong at all." OK. Then the former veep was wrong not to end the part of his job that was supposed to focus on curbing corruption in Ukraine.
And that’s the other problem with the Senate trial. House managers have been indignant that Trump used vulnerable Ukraine for his own ends. In the next breath, they take umbrage at the very idea of asking Hunter Biden, who cashed in handsomely thanks to Ukraine’s entrenched cronyism, to tell his story.
Head impeachment manager Adam Schiff has railed about the need for a "fair trial." Sadly, his idea of fair is a trial in which only the prosecutors choose the witnesses.
Sure, Hunter Biden has no information about the July 25 call. But he is living billboard for the Democrats’ double standard.
And really, D.C. Democrats always knew they wouldn’t have the 67 votes needed to remove Trump. But they did see an opportunity to take down the rare moderate Republican senator. Think Maine’s Susan Collins.
My prediction is that they damage their own brand in the process, just as Republicans paid a price for impeaching President Bill Clinton in 1998. At the end of the day, both efforts were wastes of time as well as bald exercises of partisan power to overturn the will of voters.

Tariffs and economic realities

Resumen: In other words, the U.S. should retaliate against Canada’s harming its citizens by forcing them to pay higher dairy product prices, by forcing Americans through tariffs to pay higher prices for wood and thereby raising the cost of building homes. Dr. Larry Summers, top economic adviser to President Obama, said about the Kobe, Japan, earthquake: "(The disaster) may lead to some temporary increments ironically to GDP as a process of rebuilding takes place. After devastating Floridian hurricanes, it’s not uncommon to read newspaper headlines such as "Storms create lucrative times," or "Economic growth from hurricanes could outweigh costs," or "It’s a perverse thing ... there’s real pain, but from an economic point of view, it is a plus."

Texto completo: I have been teaching economics since 1967 — 40 years of it at George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia. During that interval, economic reality has not changed. Just as Galileo’s law about the independent influence of gravity on falling objects has not changed, neither have the fundamental principles of economics. Economics is fun and simple. It’s made complicated by some economics professors — fortunately, not by my colleagues at George Mason University. Let’s apply some simple tools of economics to reveal outright myths, lies and tricks.
Who is punished by tariffs on imported goods? Let’s go through the steps. The Canadian government imposes high tariffs on American dairy imports. That forces Canadians to pay higher prices for dairy products and protects Canada’s dairy producers from American competition. What should be the U.S. government’s response to Canada’s hurting its citizens? If you were in the Trump administration, you might retaliate by imposing stiff tariffs on softwood products built from pine, spruce and fir trees used by U.S. homebuilders. In other words, the U.S. should retaliate against Canada’s harming its citizens by forcing them to pay higher dairy product prices, by forcing Americans through tariffs to pay higher prices for wood and thereby raising the cost of building homes.
Here’s a question: Are natural or man-made disasters good for the economy? Dr. Larry Summers, top economic adviser to President Obama, said about the Kobe, Japan, earthquake: "(The disaster) may lead to some temporary increments ironically to GDP as a process of rebuilding takes place. In the wake of the earlier Kobe earthquake, Japan actually gained some economic strength." After devastating Floridian hurricanes, it’s not uncommon to read newspaper headlines such as "Storms create lucrative times," or "Economic growth from hurricanes could outweigh costs," or "It’s a perverse thing ... there’s real pain, but from an economic point of view, it is a plus." Then there’s Nobel Laureate Paul Krugman who wrote in his New York Times column "After the Horror," after the 9/11 attack, "Ghastly as it may seem to say this, the terror attack — like the original day of infamy, which brought an end to the Great Depression — could do some economic good." He went on to explain that rebuilding the destruction would stimulate the economy through business investment and job creation.
One would never hear my colleagues in George Mason University’s economics department spouting such insanities. Just ask yourself whether the Japanese economy would have faced even greater opportunities for economic growth had the earthquake also struck Tokyo, Hiroshima, Yokohama and other major cities? Would the 9/11 terrorists have made a greater contribution to our economy had they also destroyed lives and buildings in Chicago, St. Louis, Los Angeles and Atlanta?
French economist Frederic Bastiat (1801-1850) explained it in his pamphlet "What is Seen and What is Not Seen." He said, "There is only one difference between a bad economist and a good one: the bad economist confines himself to the visible effect; the good economist takes into account both the effect that can be seen and those effects that must be foreseen." That’s why my George Mason University colleagues are good economists.

Texto completo: In the midst of the impeachment trial in the Senate, The New York Times had a big scoop. The paper learned that, according to a yet-to-be-published tell-all book by President Donald Trump’s third national security adviser, John Bolton, Trump told Bolton to withhold military aid from Ukraine until the Eastern European nation helped dig up dirt on the Bidens.
While some cable networks were breathless to report a development that they were sure would put more pressure on the GOP Senate to call witnesses in the Trump impeachment trial, others shrugged.
We already knew, after all, about the president’s July 25 phone call to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Trump later claimed it was a "perfect" call — which is absurd. It was wrong to delay aid to a vulnerable ally at war with Russia — and, worse, that Trump did so because he wanted Kyiv to do his campaign’s opposition research.
I am in the news business, and I’ve become immune to the drip, drip, drip of spoon-fed revelations. The Times reporters were reporting on what people who saw the manuscript told them what was in the manuscript. It’s like hearsay squared, and some of the more salacious details are likely to crumble.
Before Trump released a transcript of the July call, The Wall Street Journal had a scoop that Trump urged Zelenskiy to work with Trump’s private attorney Rudy Giuliani to find information damaging to the Bidens "about eight times" during the July call.
The transcript later revealed that Trump leaned on Zelenskiy, as Fox News’ Bret Baier figured, maybe three times "tangentially." But the inflated account — "eight times," cable pundits repeated — had fueled calls for impeachment.
The Senate confirmation hearings for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh offered a view of how the endless war of personal smears could defy common sense and still continue. Just as Kavanaugh was about to be confirmed, The Washington Post reported on a California woman who said Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her when they were both in high school.
She was so wounded; she didn’t want to be identified. But then, when she was needed as a witness to destroy his reputation, she reluctantly came forward. As did other women who claimed to be victims — and no matter how unsubstantiated or unbelievable their accusations were, these smears nonetheless found purchase in the campaign to destroy Kavanaugh’s reputation.
House managers have been indignant that Trump used vulnerable Ukraine for his own ends. In the next breath, they take umbrage at the very idea of asking Hunter Biden, who cashed in handsomely thanks to Ukraine’s entrenched cronyism, to tell his story. Sure, Hunter Biden has no information about the July 25 call. But he is living billboard for the Democrats’ double standard.
And really, D.C. Democrats always knew they wouldn’t have the 67 votes needed to remove Trump. But they did see an opportunity to take down the rare moderate Republican senator. Think Maine’s Susan Collins.
My prediction is that they damage their own brand in the process, just as Republicans paid a price for impeaching President Bill Clinton in 1998. At the end of the day, both efforts were wastes of time as well as bald exercises of partisan power to overturn the will of voters.
As a candidate, Trump promised to put a halt to "endless wars" that have mired U.S. troops in foreign hot spots. But as a president, he has stoked the "endless wars" of Beltway politics.
I remember the moment I read the transcript of the July 25 call. I was covering Trump at the U.N. General Assembly, where he finally sat down with Zelenskiy. I was appalled that Trump actually tried to get another country’s president to do his opposition research for him. And gobsmacked to realize that Trump did so during a conversation on which maybe 20 operatives — some who would not mind bringing him down — were listening in.
I don’t think for a minute that Senate Republicans didn’t find Trump’s recklessness appalling when Trump released the loose transcript. I say reckless not because the conversation could sink the country I love, but because it shows a leader who rarely considers how what he says can hurt the very people he needs to get things done.
Trump cannot claim that he won the impeachment battle, because, really, there are only losers in this saga.

Hunter Biden at center of it all

Texto completo: It's all Hunter Biden's fault. And by all, I mean everything.
Just imagine how the last few months would have played out had Biden not taken a seat on the board of the Ukrainian energy company Burisma while his father, then-Vice President Joe Biden, was leading the Obama administration's push for a less corrupt government in Ukraine. Look at each key event in the process that led to President Trump's impeachment in the House and likely acquittal in the Senate.
By the fall of 2015, a number of U.S. and European officials were calling for Ukraine to remove its top prosecutor, Victor Shokin, because he was not pursuing corruption cases aggressively enough. The complaints included Shokin's handling of the allegations against Burisma and the Ukrainian oligarch who founded it, Mykola Zlochevsky.
That pressure campaign intensified in early 2016, culminating when Joe Biden - per U.S. policy, with Congress in the loop- insisted Shokin be fired if Ukraine wanted to receive $1 billion in U.S. loan guarantees. (The International Monetary Fund was also pushing for a more aggressive anti-corruption effort.) The Ukrainian government eventually complied.
End of story, right? Nothing to see here.
For his part, Trump may still have done some bizarre things with Ukraine policy. After all, his former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, had been forced to resign under a cloud because of his dealings in that country - the New York Times triggered his departure by reporting that Ukraine had found evidence that Manafort had received millions of dollars in off-the-books payments from a pro-Russian political party there.
As Reuters' Andy Sullivan lays out, Trump's personal attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani and other supporters of the president viewed Manafort's downfall as the work of Ukrainians trying to meddle in the U.S. election. So there's a good chance Trump, bitter that his 2016 victory was stigmatized by Russia's interference on his behalf, would have pressured the new Ukrainian administration to pursue his bizarre and nonsensical theory about Ukrainians hacking the Democratic National Committee server or his belief that Ukrainian government officials improperly aided Hillary Clinton's campaign.
(And by the way, writing an opinion piece laying out Ukraine's concern about candidate Trump's comments on Russia's takeover of Crimea is hardly improper. If it were, Trump has crossed that line multiple times with his tweets supporting foreign candidates such as Boris Johnson.)
Trump may even have gone so far as to withhold the aid to Ukraine that Congress approved, in violation of the Impoundment Control Act. And that might even have led to a tell-all book by an irritated John Bolton after he was fired as Trump's national security adviser.
But violating the ICA is hardly earth-shattering. What kicked things into impeachment territory was Trump's call for an investigation of Biden. And even someone as credulous and factual-gravity-defying as Trump wouldn't have demanded an investigation of Biden if there had been no conflict-of-interest hook to hang it on.
Enter Hunter Biden, who made the jaw-droppingly stupid decision to accept a post on the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company founded and tainted by an oligarch widely labeled as corrupt, while his father was the leading Obama administration point person on Ukraine. Even if Hunter Biden's sole interest had been to help Burisma adopt better governance practices and mend its ways - I'm offering that just for the sake of argument, not because there's any evidence to support that idea - he should have known better than to lend his name to a company under investigation for money laundering.
That decision allowed Giuliani and his Ukrainian sources to cast Joe Biden's actions in a sinister light, despite the overwhelming evidence that the elder Biden was doing exactly what he was supposed to be doing. (I remain puzzled why so many Trump supporters are indifferent to the fact that removing Shokin was not just the U.S. government's goal, but that of many of its Western allies.) It also allowed Shokin to claim, contrary to what other Ukrainian prosecutors and anti-corruption activists have told reporters, that he was investigating Burisma and set to interview the younger Biden at the time he was fired.
That set the stage for Trump to ask a vulnerable foreign leader to investigate one of the president's top political rivals. This request triggered enough concern among people listening in on the call that it prompted a whistleblower complaint, resulting eventually in Trump's impeachment in the House for abuse of power and obstructing Congress.
Granted, Trump may well have avoided that fate had he acknowledged that his July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy was less than "perfect," and that he should have taken his case against Biden straight to the court of public opinion rather than trying to get Ukrainian prosecutors to do his dirty work. That version of Trump doesn't exist in our universe.
But just as Hunter Biden was the tripwire that triggered Trump's impeachment, so too was he the shadowy presence infusing the GOP defense of the president in the Senate. Time and again, Trump's attorneys and allies in the upper chamber pointed to the apparent Biden conflict of interest as a legitimate source of concern for the president. Trump wasn't demanding an investigation of a political rival; he was demanding an investigation into potentially corrupt activity by someone who, three years later, joined the presidential race.
To be clear, I don't buy that argument for a moment. Presidents legitimately concerned about corruption by U.S. citizens seek action by federal law enforcement agencies rather than trying to persuade foreign governments to announce their own investigations. But Hunter Biden's cash grab at Burisma gave Republicans enough material to cover the president's actions in a layer of legitimacy.
One of the numerous ironies here is that Hunter Biden may also have damaged his father's presidential bid beyond repair. But we won't find that out for sure until long after the Senate has acquitted Trump.

Texto completo: Francis Lucian Bagli Jr. passed away on January 31, 2020 from complications related to late stage Alzheimer's. Frank was born in Baltimore, MD, September 10, 1937 to Dr. Francis Lucian and Elizabeth O'Connor Bagli. The youngest of 4 children, Vincent, Josephine and Margaret, Frank was the tall one, a gentleman with the easy smile, precocious nature, and quiet deep faith.
He took great joy in serving others at St. Bedes Church, Faith in Action and Meals on Wheels, where he took the time to get to know and listen to all the people on his route personally. He was often late coming back home because, "folks just wanted to chat". He relaxed by working on his HO gauge train layouts and enjoyed sharing it with his family and the neighborhood kids over the years. A voracious reader, Frank enjoyed his regimen of the Wall Street Journal, Daily Press, New York Times Sunday, and just about any, "properly footnoted", non-fiction.
Frank left Baltimore in 1963 with a degree from Loyola University Maryland, his devoted wife Lynn Helen DeLalio, a new child, and toward a career in banking. He and Lynn raised their three sons in Farmingdale and Huntington New York. During his banking career he earned a Master's Degree from Stonier School of Banking from Rutgers University, and later retired from Bank Leumi. He and Lynn have spent the last 30 years as part of the Williamsburg, Virginia Community.
Whether it was driving to Baltimore or hosting friends at their home in Williamsburg, Frank loved and took great pride in his family and the friendships he and Lynn built along the way. He leaves behind his loving wife of 58 years, sons Frank, Paul and Deris, their wives Lori, Amy, and Sue in addition to 6 treasured grandchildren, Andrew, Megan, Devin, Hannah, Jack and Brennan.
A visitation will take place from 5-8pm on Friday, February 7th, at Nelsen Funeral Home, 3785 Strawberry Plains Road, Williamsburg. A funeral service will be held at 11:30am on Saturday, February 8th, at St. Bede Catholic Church, 3686 Ironbound Road, Williamsburg.

Justice Department Ramps Up Google Probe, With Heavy Focus on Ad Tools; Antitrust enforcers have contacted more than a dozen publishers, ad tech rivals and ad agencies

Texto completo: The Justice Department has reached out to more than a dozen companies in its antitrust probe of Google, including publishers, advertising technology firms and advertising agencies, as the company's online ad tools become a major focus of the investigation, according to people familiar with the matter.
In recent months, the department has been posing increasingly detailed questions—to Google's rivals and executives inside the company itself—about how Google's third-party advertising business interacts with publishers and advertisers, the people said. That digital business was built largely on the company's 2008 acquisition of the ad-technology firm DoubleClick.
Many of the questions center around two moves that Google has made in recent years that publishers and rivals say have helped consolidate its power. The first was Google's integration of its ad server, the leading tool for websites to put ad space up for sale, with its ad exchange, the industry's largest digital ad marketplace. The second move was its decision to require advertisers to use its own tools to buy ad space on YouTube.
"They are zooming in on the right topics, and that's a good thing," said Michael Nevins, chief marketing officer of Smart AdServer, maker of a rival ad technology to Google's.
Google's ad-tech business consists of software used to buy and sell ads on sites across the web. The company owns the dominant tool at every link in the complex chain between online publishers and advertisers , giving it unique power over the monetization of digital content. Many publishers and advertising rivals have charged that it has tied these tools together and to its owned-and-operated properties such as search and YouTube in anticompetitive ways.
Google, a unit of Alphabet Inc., has argued that the ad-tech industry is
competitive and that moves it made to merge products were aimed at creating a better experience for customers.
The probe's increasing emphasis on ad tech is one reason the department's antitrust chief, Makan Delrahim, recused himself last week, people familiar with the investigation said. In 2007, Mr. Delrahim advised Google in its efforts to get approval from the Federal Trade Commission to buy DoubleClick.
In addition to probing digital advertising, Justice Department officials are examining other aspects of Google's business. Some of the companies that have been interviewed are rivals hurt by the dominance of its search and mobile businesses, such as Yelp, DuckDuckGo and Oracle Corp., according to some of the people familiar with the matter.

Wall Street Journal publisher News Corp, a longtime Google critic, was among the publishers contacted by antitrust investigators, along with New York Times Co., Gannett Co., Nexstar Media Group Inc. and Condé Nast, some of the people said. Bloomberg earlier reported on contacts with some of the publishers.
State attorneys general who are pursuing their own Google investigation met Tuesday with Justice Department officials, a potential step toward closer coordination of the two probes.
The state officials sent out a subpoena to Google in the fall that was dominated by questions on the inner workings of its ad-tech products.
Much of the Justice Department's questioning has focused on the "sell side" of Google's technology—that is, products like DoubleClick for Publishers, which connects online publishers to Google's advertising exchange. Virtually all major news publishers use that Google software. DoubleClick for Publishers and the exchange, commonly known as AdX, were rebranded as a single product called Google Ad Manager in 2018.
In the past two months, the department's outreach to advertising agencies indicates it is also interested in the "buy side," the people familiar with the matter said. The investigation puts ad agencies in a delicate spot because many of them use Google's tools and rely on Google as a major advertising client.

The growing regulatory scrutiny has prompted some Google executives to discuss informally whether the company should consider divesting its third-party ad-tech business, according to people familiar with the situation. People close to Google said the company is still responding to informational requests from the Justice Department and hasn't begun to discuss any potential changes to its business with the department.
Those who want to explore divesting the business note that it has steadily declined in importance to Google overall since the DoubleClick purchase, while units like search and YouTube have soared.
In part, this is because the legacy DoubleClick business is focused on display advertising on desktop websites, and desktop web traffic has stopped growing as web users have shifted their time and attention toward mobile devices, the people familiar with the situation said.
"We have no plans to sell or exit this business," Google spokeswoman Julie Tarallo McAlister said. "We're deeply committed to providing value to a wide array of publisher and advertiser partners in a highly competitive sector."
Google's parent, Alphabet, doesn't break out financial results for its third-party ad-tech business specifically. The unit is part of Google's business of servicing its network of website partners, which accounted for $21.5 billion in 2019, about 13% of the company's overall revenue. That is down from 31% in 2008, the year the DoubleClick deal closed. Google says it passes about 70% of this revenue on to its network partners. Google's third-party ad business represents a fraction of the revenue of its reported Google Network Members unit, and has weighed on the profits of that segment, according to people familiar with the business.
One difficulty in separating the business is that third-party ad products are closely integrated with other Google technology, said another person familiar with the situation
Attorney General William Barr said in an interview at The Wall Street Journal's CEO Council in December that he wanted the Justice Department to "fish or cut bait" on its investigation into Google and other large technology companies by the end of this year.

Texto completo: From the consumer's view, the world of mezcal in 2020 is radically different from that of 10 years ago. Del Maguey, which 25 years ago pioneered the discovery and marketing in the United States of small-production, geographically specific bottles, is still going strong, though its visionary founder, Ron Cooper, sold a controlling interest in the brand to the beverage giant Pernod Ricard in 2017.
Rather than packaging his discoveries as a luxury brand or with celebrity tie-ins in the fashion of tequila, mezcal's agave cousin, Cooper emphasized the cultural significance of mezcal, highlighting its ability - through traditional, laborious methods of production - to transmit the character of a place and a people.
But where 10 years ago, Del Maguey alone seemed to be shining a light on the enormous potential and complexity of mezcal, now more than a few entrepreneurs, no doubt inspired by Cooper's example, have entered the artisanal mezcal business.
While "artisanal" has become a marketing buzzword, it seems to mean something more with mezcal. Entrepreneurs with dollar signs in their eyes have gotten into the act, no surprise, but the best and most interesting bottles are still the most rustic and distinctive, rather than the most polished.
Nowadays, dozens of small-production bottles are available, each highlighting the styles of small mezcaleros, or mezcal makers, local production techniques and the various sorts of agaves that are permitted to be used in mezcal production.
Unlike tequila, which can be produced only from the blue agave in the state of Jalisco and a few surrounding areas, mezcal can legally be made in 10 Mexican states with any sort of agave.
Practically speaking, though, most mezcal comes from Oaxaca, and most of the time it's made from the espadín agave. Yet it's not rare to find mezcals made of other sorts of agaves with names like barril, jabalí, cuishe, tepeztate and tobalá.
To get a sense of the evolved world of mezcal today, the spirits panel recently tasted 20 bottles. For the tasting, Florence Fabricant of The New York Times and I were joined by two drinks writers and historians, David Wondrich and Robert Simonson.
Mezcal, like tequila, often comes with an age statement: joven, or young; reposado, which is aged in oak for up to a year, and añejo, which is aged one to three years. I love the purity of agave spirits undistorted by oak, so for this tasting we stuck to joven.
As usual, we bought all the bottles retail, and we capped the selections at $100 a bottle, which ruled out quite a few. Even without the most expensive choices, we all marveled at the high level of quality in the tasting. We were floored by the wide variety of flavors, complex and strange in the best possible way.
In the past I had come to think of smokiness as the defining feature of mezcal. In this tasting, smokiness, which comes from roasting the agaves in rock-lined pits before fermentation, was just one of many components.
We found aromas and flavors of herbs, vegetables, jalapeños, flowers and a lot more, often in combinations that seemed to vary widely from bottle to bottle.
What accounts for such variety? Partly, it's a reflection of the diversity of raw materials. Agaves take a long time to grow, and can vary in age. Some are harvested after five years, others after many more.
It's also a function of production techniques - copper pot stills are most common, for example, but some mezcaleros still use clay stills.
Local traditions differ as well. Sometimes mezcals are redistilled with grains or nuts to add flavor.
It's often said by mezcal enthusiasts that the spirit needs to be at least 45% alcohol to show its true character. Perhaps that's true. Seven bottles in our tasting had alcohol levels under 45%, and only two of those made our top 10.
Our top bottle was the Rezpiral Abel Martínez Series Four, named after the mezcalero who produced it. It was briny, deep and complex with a pronounced saline quality.
No. 2 was the subtle, complex, lightly smoky Agave de Cortés Espadín, the sort of spirit in which you seem to taste something different with every sip. By contrast, the No. 3 Sombra was rich, deep and assertive, though not as complex. At $35, it was also our best value.
I recognize that many of these mezcals may be difficult to find. The good news is that even if you cannot find the precise bottles that we tasted, many of these brands offer a variety of different bottlings, made by other mezcaleros in different villages using their own techniques and sometimes other sorts of agaves.
They are all worth trying. No doubt, you will find favorites that we did not taste. With mezcal circa 2020, discovery is part of the thrill.

Hall of Fame Packers safety Wood dies at 83

Texto completo: Willie Wood was a fiercely athletic safety for the Green Bay Packers whose interception in Super Bowl I remains a cherished highlight for the organization.
Wood died Monday at an assisted living facility in his hometown of Washington, D.C., the Packers announced. He was 83.
Wood had been suffering from advanced dementia for years.
"The Green Bay Packers Family lost a legend today with the passing of Willie Wood," Packers President/CEO Mark Murphy said. "Willie's success story, rising from an undrafted rookie free agent to the Pro Football Hall of Fame, is an inspiration to generations of football fans. While his health challenges kept him from returning to Lambeau Field in recent years, his alumni weekend visits were cherished by both Willie and our fans. We extend our deepest condolences to Willie's family and friends."
The dynamic Wood was regarded as one of the best defensive backs in NFL history, a player whose vicious hits and plentiful interceptions dominated an entire decade in the 1960s. He played 12 seasons from 1960-71 — all with the Packers — and ranks second in franchise history with 48 career interceptions (trailing only Bobby Dillon's 52). Wood is the Packers' career leader in punt-return yardage with 1,391.
Wood was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1989.
"The game has lost a true legend with the passing of Willie Wood," Hall of Fame President & CEO David Baker said. "He had an unbelievable football career which helped transform Green Bay, Wisconsin into Titletown U.S.A. Willie was a rare player who always fought to be a great teammate and achieve success. He entered the league as an undrafted free agent and became one of the greatest to ever play the game. The Hall of Fame will forever keep his legacy alive to serve as inspiration to future generations."
Wood's streak of 166 consecutive games played ranks fourth behind quarterback Brett Favre (255), offensive lineman Forrest Gregg (167) and long snapper Rob Davis (167), a testament to the durability and attitude Wood hoped would define his game.
"Determination probably was my trademark," Wood said. "I was talented but so were a lot of people. I'd like people to tell you I was the toughest guy they ever played against."
Wood, who began his career as a quarterback, followed a circuitous route to Green Bay. A year of junior college in California gave way to a three-year career at Southern California with modest numbers and little national buzz. Wood went undrafted as an undersized black quarterback and relied instead on Bill Butler, his coach at the Washington, D.C., Boys Club, to write letters to pro teams campaigning on his behalf.
"Mr. Lombardi, if you could see this kid unshackled you would really agree with me," Butler said in a letter to coach Vince Lombardi in December of 1959. "If you hadn't contemplated giving him a chance, just try him one time and I'll guarantee you'll be glad you did."
Wood switched to defense and went through training camp with the Packers in 1960. He made the team as a rookie free agent and contributed immediately as a punt returner on special teams.
One year later, however, the legend of Wood was born. He replaced injured starter Jess Whittenton at safety late in the 1961 season and entrenched himself as one of the premier defensive backs in the league.
Wood made the Pro Bowl eight times in the next 11 seasons and led the Packers in interceptions five times. He earned AP All-Pro honors six times and was a unanimous selection in 1965 and 1966.
Wood retired after the 1971 season and took a job as an assistant coach for the San Diego Chargers. He went on to become the first black head coach in professional football by taking over the Philadelphia Bell of the World Football League in 1975. Five years later he became the first black head coach of the Canadian Football League as well.
"The thing is, my dad never wanted to leave football," Andre Wood, a son of Willie's, told The New York Times in an article published in 2016. "He needed a stable way to make a living. But I know he would have stayed in the NFL coaching track had he been asked to. But he wasn't."
Perhaps his finest moment came in Super Bowl I when the Packers played the Kansas City Chiefs. Wood undercut an ugly throw by Chiefs quarterback Len Dawson for an easy interception that, after a 50-yard return, set up a touchdown in what finished as a blowout win for the Packers.
"My dad was so proud of his Super Bowl moment, but I used to tease him about being tackled from behind on the play," Willie Wood Jr. told the Times.
"And his response would be, 'Yes, but I was there.'"
Wood, however, had no recollection of that play and hardly remembered his playing career at all. As detailed by the Times, the aging Wood spent the last decade in an assisted living facility in Washington. While he originally entered for chronic pain in his neck, hip and knee, Wood eventually developed dementia that sapped his memory and limited his cognitive functions.
He sometimes went days without speaking, according to the article.
"It's difficult to not be able to talk to him," Willie Wood Jr. told the Times. "He was a great father. As good an athlete as he was, he was 10 times that as a father."
Wood often wore a Packers hat during his time at the assisted living facility, even though he could not describe the exact connection between himself and the organization. But Wood knew he loved football, and when a reporter from the Times asked if he would play the sport again if given the chance, Wood's answer was simple.
"Without waiting even a beat," the article said, "Wood firmly nodded."
"You liked it that much?"
"He nodded again."
Wood is survived by his two sons and a daughter. Funeral arrangements are pending.

Orioles general manager headlines Shorebirds' banquet

Texto completo: Mike Elias isn't saying much about the Houston Astros' sign-stealing scandal that rocked Major League Baseball, despite being a part of the organization when the incident occurred.
"I'm not going to give an in-depth comment on the topic, but we're going to do things the right way with the Orioles," he said.
Instead, Elias is focused on his second season as general manager of the Baltimore Orioles, acting as a guest speaker at the Delmarva Shorebirds' annual hot stove banquet on Jan. 23.
The event serves as an opportunity for fans and officials to come together to talk baseball.
The Shorebirds are just four months removed from their historic 2019 season that saw the club win 90 games and advance to the postseason for the first time since 2005. The squad was led by a strong group of pitchers, highlighted by Grayson Rodriguez and Drew Rom, and solid position players, such as infielder Adam Hall and outfielder Robert Neustrom.
Delmarva also hosted 2019 No. 1 overall selection Adley Rutschman toward the end of the season. Elias said he would like to see the catcher start the upcoming season with the Frederick Keys, however it will depend on his performance in spring training.
But Thursday night was about 2020 and how the Shorebirds, and Orioles, would find ways to succeed.
Baltimore was the second worst team in the MLB last season, finishing the year with a 54-108 overall record. However, with a young core expected to make the big-league club, the Orioles' general manger is confident the organization's rebuild is going as planned.
"Some of the names we've been reading about are going to start to arrive in Camden Yards," Elias said. "It's still about player development and those individual performances and not necessarily the team's win and loss record. Those guys are taking steps forward, graduating to the big leagues and adjusting to big-league life."
Elias also expressed his satisfaction with Baltimore's minor-league system.
The Bowie Baysox — the Orioles' Double-A affiliate — also advanced to the postseason, while the Aberdeen Ironbirds — the short-season club — finished with some of their best numbers in history.
After leading the club in 2019, Shorebirds' manager Kyle Moore was promoted to Frederick, replacing longtime skipper Ryan Minor who was let go from the organization. Dave Anderson, who has been with the Orioles the last six years, most recently as a minor-league infield coordinator, will take over on Delmarva.
"It's exactly what you want to see, especially when you're in a rebuild," he said. "We're focused on that type of success. The success of teams like the Shorebirds is really going to dictate what we do the next couple of years in Baltimore."
In November, news broke that several minor-league teams throughout the country were on the chopping block as part of a new MLB plan to streamline its minor league system for efficiency and to improve conditions for players, according to a New York Times report. The Frederick Keys was one of 42 clubs on the list.
While nothing is official, minor-league officials have said they'll do everything in their power to prevent the loss of any team. Elias provided little information on the status of Frederick or how the Orioles will respond should they lose any club.
"All I know is that this is being handled at the league level," he said. "I think Major League Baseball wants to see a healthier player development environment, and minor-league baseball has a lot of interest as well, and I'm sure both sides will come up with a solution."
Though he couldn't say much, Elias did respond to questions about the recent situation regarding the Astros.
Recently, The Athletic reported the Astros had used technology to steal opposing teams' signs that allowed Houston batters to know what type of pitch was coming. The Astros would go on to win the 2017 World Series.
Once news of the scandal broke, Houston was fined $5 million by the MLB and forced to forfeit draft picks in the 2020 and 2021 MLB Draft. General manager Jeff Luhnow and field manager A.J. Hinch were fired following a suspension sent down by the league.
Elias served as Houston's assistant general manager and oversaw player development and minor-league operations before coming to Baltimore in 2018.
Elias said his primary duties in Houston were dealing with the minor leagues and scouting, noting the scandal doesn't detract from the work he and his staff did in those areas.
"I think there's a history of things happening in our sport and other sports, and that's why we have good people in the sport to get it fixed and be better," Elias said.
While one general manager spoke of the future, the other highlighted the success of 2019 and discussed some notable events taking place at Arthur W. Perdue Stadium next season.
Coming off a 90-win season, Shorebirds' general manager Chris Bitters is excited to have fans back at the ballfield watching some of the Orioles' top prospects.
"We're kicking off baseball for bird land right here in Salisbury," he said. "Last year was the cherry on top. We had all these great things going on and then boom, we catapult to best team record in team history.
"We had exciting baseball every night."
The Shorebirds also unveiled their promotional schedule for 2020, which includes several giveaways and theme nights.
A Trey Mancini Jedi bobblehead will be given away on May 8, while a Hawaiian shirt giveaway will take place on June 26. Theme nights include Harry Potter (May 22) and Nickelodeon Night (July 17).
"There's going to be great opportunities throughout the year for the fans to come out and enjoy a giveaway, fireworks night or a value night," Bitters said.
Delmarva kicks off its season April 8 at home against the Asheville Tourists. Team rosters will be announced following spring training.

Texto completo: Willie Wood was a fiercely athletic safety for the Green Bay Packers whose interception in Super Bowl I remains a cherished highlight for the organization.
Wood died Monday at an assisted living facility in his hometown of Washington, D.C., the Packers announced. He was 83.
Wood had been suffering from advanced dementia for years.
"The Green Bay Packers Family lost a legend today with the passing of Willie Wood," Packers President/CEO Mark Murphy said. "Willie's success story, rising from an undrafted rookie free agent to the Pro Football Hall of Fame, is an inspiration to generations of football fans. While his health challenges kept him from returning to Lambeau Field in recent years, his alumni weekend visits were cherished by both Willie and our fans. We extend our deepest condolences to Willie's family and friends."
The dynamic Wood was regarded as one of the best defensive backs in NFL history, a player whose vicious hits and plentiful interceptions dominated an entire decade in the 1960s. He played 12 seasons from 1960-71 — all with the Packers — and ranks second in franchise history with 48 career interceptions (trailing only Bobby Dillon's 52). Wood is the Packers' career leader in punt-return yardage with 1,391.
Wood was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1989.
"The game has lost a true legend with the passing of Willie Wood," Hall of Fame President & CEO David Baker said. "He had an unbelievable football career which helped transform Green Bay, Wisconsin into Titletown U.S.A. Willie was a rare player who always fought to be a great teammate and achieve success. He entered the league as an undrafted free agent and became one of the greatest to ever play the game. The Hall of Fame will forever keep his legacy alive to serve as inspiration to future generations."
Wood's streak of 166 consecutive games played ranks fourth behind quarterback Brett Favre (255), offensive lineman Forrest Gregg (167) and long snapper Rob Davis (167), a testament to the durability and attitude Wood hoped would define his game.
"Determination probably was my trademark," Wood said. "I was talented but so were a lot of people. I'd like people to tell you I was the toughest guy they ever played against."
Wood, who began his career as a quarterback, followed a circuitous route to Green Bay. A year of junior college in California gave way to a three-year career at Southern California with modest numbers and little national buzz. Wood went undrafted as an undersized black quarterback and relied instead on Bill Butler, his coach at the Washington, D.C., Boys Club, to write letters to pro teams campaigning on his behalf.
"Mr. Lombardi, if you could see this kid unshackled you would really agree with me," Butler said in a letter to coach Vince Lombardi in December of 1959. "If you hadn't contemplated giving him a chance, just try him one time and I'll guarantee you'll be glad you did."
Wood switched to defense and went through training camp with the Packers in 1960. He made the team as a rookie free agent and contributed immediately as a punt returner on special teams.
One year later, however, the legend of Wood was born. He replaced injured starter Jess Whittenton at safety late in the 1961 season and entrenched himself as one of the premier defensive backs in the league.
Wood made the Pro Bowl eight times in the next 11 seasons and led the Packers in interceptions five times. He earned AP All-Pro honors six times and was a unanimous selection in 1965 and 1966.
Wood retired after the 1971 season and took a job as an assistant coach for the San Diego Chargers. He went on to become the first black head coach in professional football by taking over the Philadelphia Bell of the World Football League in 1975. Five years later he became the first black head coach of the Canadian Football League as well.
"The thing is, my dad never wanted to leave football," Andre Wood, a son of Willie's, told The New York Times in an article published in 2016. "He needed a stable way to make a living. But I know he would have stayed in the NFL coaching track had he been asked to. But he wasn't."
Perhaps his finest moment came in Super Bowl I when the Packers played the Kansas City Chiefs. Wood undercut an ugly throw by Chiefs quarterback Len Dawson for an easy interception that, after a 50-yard return, set up a touchdown in what finished as a blowout win for the Packers.
"My dad was so proud of his Super Bowl moment, but I used to tease him about being tackled from behind on the play," Willie Wood Jr. told the Times.
"And his response would be, 'Yes, but I was there.'"
Wood, however, had no recollection of that play and hardly remembered his playing career at all. As detailed by the Times, the aging Wood spent the last decade in an assisted living facility in Washington. While he originally entered for chronic pain in his neck, hip and knee, Wood eventually developed dementia that sapped his memory and limited his cognitive functions.
He sometimes went days without speaking, according to the article.
"It's difficult to not be able to talk to him," Willie Wood Jr. told the Times. "He was a great father. As good an athlete as he was, he was 10 times that as a father."
Wood often wore a Packers hat during his time at the assisted living facility, even though he could not describe the exact connection between himself and the organization. But Wood knew he loved football, and when a reporter from the Times asked if he would play the sport again if given the chance, Wood's answer was simple.
"Without waiting even a beat," the article said, "Wood firmly nodded."
"You liked it that much?"
"He nodded again."
Wood is survived by his two sons and a daughter. Funeral arrangements are pending.

Japan races to build more coal-burning power plants

Texto completo: Just beyond the windows of Satsuki Kanno's apartment overlooking Tokyo Bay, a behemoth from a bygone era will soon rise: a coal-burning power plant, part of a buildup of coal power that is unheard-of for an advanced economy.
It is one unintended consequence of the Fukushima nuclear disaster almost a decade ago, which forced Japan to all but close its nuclear power program. Japan now plans to build as many as 22 new coal-burning power plants - one of the dirtiest sources of electricity - at 17 different sites in the next five years, just at a time when the world needs to slash carbon dioxide emissions to fight global warming.
"Why coal, why now?" said Kanno, a homemaker in Yokosuka, the site for two of the coal-burning units that will be built just several hundred feet from her home. "It's the worst possible thing they could build."
Together the 22 power plants would emit almost as much carbon dioxide annually as all the passenger cars sold each year in the United States. The construction stands in contrast with Japan's effort to portray this summer's Olympic Games in Tokyo as one of the greenest ever.
The Yokosuka project has prompted unusual pushback in Japan, where environmental groups more typically focus their objections on nuclear power. But some local residents are suing the government over its approval of the new coal-burning plant in what supporters hope will jump-start opposition to coal in Japan.
The Japanese government, the plaintiffs say, rubber-stamped the project without a proper environmental assessment. The complaint is noteworthy because it argues that the plant will not only degrade local air quality, but will also endanger communities by contributing to climate change.
Carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere is the major driver of global warming, because it traps the sun's heat. Coal burning is one of the biggest single sources of carbon dioxide emissions.
Japan is already experiencing severe effects from climate change. Scientists have said that a heat wave in 2018 that killed more than 1,000 people could not have happened without climate change. Because of heat concerns, the International Olympic Committee was compelled to move the Tokyo Olympics' marathon events to a cooler city almost 700 miles north.
Japan's policy sets it apart from other developed economies. Britain, the birthplace of the industrial revolution, is set to phase out coal power by 2025, and France has said it will shut down its coal power plants even earlier, by 2022. In the U.S., utilities are rapidly retiring coal power and no new plants are actively under development.
But Japan relies on coal for more than a third of its power generation needs. And while older coal plants will start retiring, eventually reducing overall coal dependency, the country still expects to meet more than a quarter of its electricity needs from coal in 2030.

Texto completo: Willie Wood was a fiercely athletic safety for the Green Bay Packers whose interception in Super Bowl I remains a cherished highlight for the organization.
Wood died Monday at an assisted living facility in his hometown of Washington, D.C., the Packers announced. He was 83.
Wood had been suffering from advanced dementia for years.
"The Green Bay Packers Family lost a legend today with the passing of Willie Wood," Packers President/CEO Mark Murphy said. "Willie's success story, rising from an undrafted rookie free agent to the Pro Football Hall of Fame, is an inspiration to generations of football fans. While his health challenges kept him from returning to Lambeau Field in recent years, his alumni weekend visits were cherished by both Willie and our fans. We extend our deepest condolences to Willie's family and friends."
The dynamic Wood was regarded as one of the best defensive backs in NFL history, a player whose vicious hits and plentiful interceptions dominated an entire decade in the 1960s. He played 12 seasons from 1960-71 — all with the Packers — and ranks second in franchise history with 48 career interceptions (trailing only Bobby Dillon's 52). Wood is the Packers' career leader in punt-return yardage with 1,391.
Wood was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1989.
"The game has lost a true legend with the passing of Willie Wood," Hall of Fame President & CEO David Baker said. "He had an unbelievable football career which helped transform Green Bay, Wisconsin into Titletown U.S.A. Willie was a rare player who always fought to be a great teammate and achieve success. He entered the league as an undrafted free agent and became one of the greatest to ever play the game. The Hall of Fame will forever keep his legacy alive to serve as inspiration to future generations."
Wood's streak of 166 consecutive games played ranks fourth behind quarterback Brett Favre (255), offensive lineman Forrest Gregg (167) and long snapper Rob Davis (167), a testament to the durability and attitude Wood hoped would define his game.
"Determination probably was my trademark," Wood said. "I was talented but so were a lot of people. I'd like people to tell you I was the toughest guy they ever played against."
Wood, who began his career as a quarterback, followed a circuitous route to Green Bay. A year of junior college in California gave way to a three-year career at Southern California with modest numbers and little national buzz. Wood went undrafted as an undersized black quarterback and relied instead on Bill Butler, his coach at the Washington, D.C., Boys Club, to write letters to pro teams campaigning on his behalf.
"Mr. Lombardi, if you could see this kid unshackled you would really agree with me," Butler said in a letter to coach Vince Lombardi in December of 1959. "If you hadn't contemplated giving him a chance, just try him one time and I'll guarantee you'll be glad you did."
Wood switched to defense and went through training camp with the Packers in 1960. He made the team as a rookie free agent and contributed immediately as a punt returner on special teams.
One year later, however, the legend of Wood was born. He replaced injured starter Jess Whittenton at safety late in the 1961 season and entrenched himself as one of the premier defensive backs in the league.
Wood made the Pro Bowl eight times in the next 11 seasons and led the Packers in interceptions five times. He earned AP All-Pro honors six times and was a unanimous selection in 1965 and 1966.
Wood retired after the 1971 season and took a job as an assistant coach for the San Diego Chargers. He went on to become the first black head coach in professional football by taking over the Philadelphia Bell of the World Football League in 1975. Five years later he became the first black head coach of the Canadian Football League as well.
"The thing is, my dad never wanted to leave football," Andre Wood, a son of Willie's, told The New York Times in an article published in 2016. "He needed a stable way to make a living. But I know he would have stayed in the NFL coaching track had he been asked to. But he wasn't."
Perhaps his finest moment came in Super Bowl I when the Packers played the Kansas City Chiefs. Wood undercut an ugly throw by Chiefs quarterback Len Dawson for an easy interception that, after a 50-yard return, set up a touchdown in what finished as a blowout win for the Packers.
"My dad was so proud of his Super Bowl moment, but I used to tease him about being tackled from behind on the play," Willie Wood Jr. told the Times.
"And his response would be, 'Yes, but I was there.'"
Wood, however, had no recollection of that play and hardly remembered his playing career at all. As detailed by the Times, the aging Wood spent the last decade in an assisted living facility in Washington. While he originally entered for chronic pain in his neck, hip and knee, Wood eventually developed dementia that sapped his memory and limited his cognitive functions.
He sometimes went days without speaking, according to the article.
"It's difficult to not be able to talk to him," Willie Wood Jr. told the Times. "He was a great father. As good an athlete as he was, he was 10 times that as a father."
Wood often wore a Packers hat during his time at the assisted living facility, even though he could not describe the exact connection between himself and the organization. But Wood knew he loved football, and when a reporter from the Times asked if he would play the sport again if given the chance, Wood's answer was simple.
"Without waiting even a beat," the article said, "Wood firmly nodded."
"You liked it that much?"
"He nodded again."
Wood is survived by his two sons and a daughter. Funeral arrangements are pending.

Texto completo: The wait for my rental car at Montreal-Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport last February was slow, but the talk was breakaway fast. I joined the line with a National Hockey League scout for the New Jersey Devils on his way to a tournament to look at promising teenage skaters.
"Skating is a way of life up here," the native Quebecois said, as my sturdy Nissan SUV pulled up, poised to plow through the snowy roads of southern Quebec where I'd come simply to skate.
As a winter lover who once traveled to Winnipeg to skate that city's sculpture-dotted frozen river in below-zero temperatures, I was intrigued by the icy fount of adventurous possibilities in Quebec, Canada's largest province, where it's possible to escape the oval confines of what we normally think of as ice rinks and skate for long, sinuous stretches on frozen trails through forests and snowy landscapes.
Skating trails can be found across Canada. They embrace the landscape when little is growing but frost and hark back to the origins of skating as a means of travel.
In Quebec, many parks and villages host skating areas that take a variety of forms, from ribbons plowed on rivers to forests that are flooded to create skating mazes.
Several of these ice innovations lie in Mauricie and Lanaudière, two of the 17 administrative regions that make up Quebec province, roughly midway between Montreal and Quebec City.
In terms of tourism, winter is among the busiest seasons here. Snowmobilers come to sled inn-to-inn; "glissades," or sledding runs, abound, from public parks to private resorts; and ice-fishing shanties create pop-up villages of down-padded anglers.
With ice skates in my carry-on, I laced up to explore Quebec's long, winding skating trails in a three-day ice quest.
Island
skating trail
At Trois-Rivières, a two-hour drive from Montreal, the broad and swift St. Lawrence doesn't freeze except in some sheltered bays. A pair of islands in the intersecting St.-Maurice River creates three channels where they meet the larger waterway, giving Trois-Rivières or Three Rivers, the second oldest Francophone city in North America, its name.
On one of those islands, Île St.-Quentin, park managers seasonally flood an ice-skating path that's about 1¼ miles. The frozen maze skirts the seaway, flowing with jagged cells of ice, and weaves into the hardwood forest behind it. Following the contours of the land, it had enough gradual downhills to persuade several skaters to wear helmets.
I laced my skates inside the park's generous field house, which offered fat-tire bike rentals for rides on another trail, shared by snowshoers, that runs for about 2 miles around the periphery of the island.
With just a few skaters sharing the ice on a sunny and windy weekday, I had the "sentier de patin," or ice path, largely to myself, allowing me to skate the route in all directions without fear of collisions. After an exploratory foray, slow and curious, I thrilled to make each iteration different, taking the first alley right away from the river and the second left toward it, circling a warming tent one way, then the other, and edging back on the inland route, taking occasional spurs in unanticipated directions in the exhilarating labyrinth that held me safe in its geometry.
Although the ice trail was quiet, it didn't take long to find Mauricie's winter pilgrims. About 30 miles northeast of town, I checked into Le Baluchon Eco-Resort behind a dozen exhilarated French snowmobilers who were sledding inn to inn.
On the Rivière du Loup, or Wolf River, Le Baluchon offers 89 rooms in a mix of inns and chalets on 1,000 acres featuring about 25 miles of cross-country ski and snowshoe trails, a tubing run and an ice rink with supplied equipment for broomball - a hockey-like game played with brooms and without skates. The sledders headed straight for the Nordic spa to steep in a series of hydrotherapy pools indoors and out.
Later that evening, a full moon lit the riverside trail to the inn's restaurant - acclaimed for its menu using local ingredients in dishes like walleye with Quebec seaweed butter - and waterfalls stilled by ice.
Agritourism
on ice
One winter, when Jean-Pierre Binette and Madeleine Courchesne, beekeepers in rural Notre-Dame-du-Mont-Carmel, about an hour north of Trois-Rivières, had three children under age 9, they flooded a small section of woods on their property. Excited by the frozen forest playground, their children invited their friends, who invited their friends. In 1997, the seasonal diversion became a secondary business as Le Domaine de la Forêt Perdue, or the Lost Forest, opened to the public, keeping a form of agritourism alive in winter (in summer, they offer a high-ropes course).
"We were the first skating path in Quebec, and now we are training people who are opening trails around the province," Thérèse Deslauriers, the managing director of the Forêt Perdue, said, as she worked the rustic entry house that doubles as a retail shop for honey products.
Outside, beyond the skate rental tent, more than 9 miles of iceways wove through pine and hardwood forests dotted with farm pens occupied by goats, sheep, ducks, deer and more exotic animals, including an ostrich. Next to the alpaca enclosure, a repurposed phone booth dispensed handfuls of animal feed for a Canadian quarter.
Many skaters brought their lunches. For the less prepared, Forêt Perdue offers a heated snack bar in a tent and a maple candy cabin in the woods.
Inviting though it was, I skipped the snack bar, threw my skates in the car and drove roughly 40 miles east to another of the grand lodges that draw winter fans to Mauricie. Like a castle-size version of a log cabin, Hôtel Sacacomie sits high above frozen Sacacomie Lake, offering wintry panoramas from its pine-hewn dining room with a roaring fire in the fieldstone fireplace - the perfect place to warm up over local smoked trout and duck confit poutine.
A frozen river
After an overnight snowfall of 4 inches, the 5.6-mile skating path on the L'Assomption River at Parc Louis-Querbes in Joliette, about midway between Le Baluchon and Montreal, was already open and plowed by 9 a.m., serving a smattering of speedskaters and slower gliders.
I skated hard for an hour, covering the entire route, and was not alone. Like runners in warmer cities, the earliest Joliette skaters came out to exercise in the light morning traffic. By the time I circled back to the park field house just after 10 a.m., a food shack next to the ice had opened, serving beignets and tea to the growing collection of families teaching their under-10s to skate by holding onto loaner sleds and sharing the wonder of skating on a seasonally stilled river.
I intended to leave the river and head straight to the airport in Montreal but couldn't resist another skating stop so close to it. Diverting 30 minutes north to Bois de Belle-Rivière, I took a final 1.5-mile spin on yet another frozen forest path. In this age of vanishing ice, I skated with a profound appreciation for the transformation of winter and the spirit of ice makers to delight those who love the season.

Texto completo: Warren knows what she’s fighting for
As state representatives, we work hard to find solutions and pass bills that benefit New Hampshire’s families. Everyone we represent knows that delivering results is what really counts.
We know that Sen. Elizabeth Warren can deliver, and that’s why we’re supporting her for president.
We all know Warren has plans — detailed ones at that. Her plans to empower workers, make a historic investment in affordable housing, and make early childhood education and college available to all will make a huge difference in the lives of people in the Upper Valley and all across New Hampshire.
It takes hard work and determination to find the right solutions. And then, the hard part really starts — building consensus, fighting big money groups trying to buy influence and getting other lawmakers on board.
Warren has big dreams and big plans. And she knows how to make those plans a reality because she has a proven record of passing legislation and creating actual change, not just talking about it.
Even before she was elected to office, Warren saw a problem — American families being ripped off by corporations — and came up with a solution. She created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, even in the face of opposition from the financial industry. Thanks to her determination, the agency has returned more than $12 billion to families who were ripped off.
In the Senate, she has worked across the aisle to make hearing aids available over the counter, increase access to care for our veterans, fight the opioid epidemic and more. And, not for nothing, she’s gotten more than a dozen of her proposals signed into law even with Majority Leader Mitch McConnell leading the Senate and President Donald Trump in the White House.
The key to Warren’s success is she understands you don’t go to the bargaining table with half a loaf. You need to be clear about what you’re fighting for — and we know that Elizabeth Warren is ready to fight for all of us. We need her in office fighting for an economy — and a government — that works for everyone.

Biden and Klobuchar might be just the ticket
I have been having a recurring “nightmare” that history will repeat itself. In the 1972 presidential campaign, Sen. Edmund Muskie from Maine was a solid candidate and the front-runner going into the Iowa caucuses. Sen. George McGovern from South Dakota, initially a dark-horse candidate, made a strong showing, which gave his more left-leaning campaign national attention and some momentum. Muskie won the caucuses and the New Hampshire primary by small margins. However, his campaign was damaged when the Manchester Union Leader accused Muskie’s wife of being a drunkard and racist and published the so-called “Canuck letter,” which reportedly disparaged French Canadians. Later, during the Watergate investigation, the FBI revealed evidence that the letter was forged and part of President Richard Nixon’s “dirty tricks” campaign against Democrats. However, the damage was done and Muskie dropped out of the campaign.
The very liberal, antiwar McGovern went on to become the Democratic Party’s standard bearer and Democrats enthusiastically united behind him. As a young Democrat at the time, I was thrilled and worked for his election against Nixon. Sadly, McGovern lost 49 states.
I hope the Democrats in this campaign recognize the similarities with 1972 when choosing a candidate to defeat the current president, who is proving to be more powerful than Richard Nixon and even more dangerous to our system of government. Our country is large, with a very diverse population. We need an intelligent government, led by a proven team that can appeal to the varied constituencies that make up our nation and is flexible enough to lead and solve problems and is capable of uniting us to forge that more perfect union.
To that end, I encourage Democrats to consider a ticket of former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Amy Klobuchar.

Inspired by Buttigieg
I first saw former Mayor Pete Buttigieg at his August town hall in Hanover. As I left, I said to myself, “I’m going to work on his campaign.” It seemed like a big decision based on the fact that a few months ago, I had not heard of him. I knew I wanted to campaign for him because I had never felt so calm and safe in front of a politician. When I talked with my friends and family about how Buttigieg made me feel, I noticed a pattern: He made us all feel safe. We all trust him.
Recently, I wondered where this sense of comfort came from. The last candidate I trusted and felt inspired by was Jack Kennedy. They both have a certain indescribable pizazz. While Buttigieg’s policy preferences are excellent, it is his relaxed and self-confident behavior that won my support.
Why does Buttigieg stand out to me more than other candidates? Years ago, I was interested in how politicians’ facial expressions and body language influence voters. As a Dartmouth professor of government (emeritus), I’m trained to distinguish genuine, relaxed leaders from tense people trying to act like leaders. Buttigieg caught my trained eye with his genuine, gentle interactions with voters.
Scientific studies show the effects of politicians’ nonverbal behavior on viewers are far stronger than usually realized. Whether conscious or not, viewers tend to have emotional responses parallel to the facial expressions they’re watching. When combined with agreement on policies, positive emotions increase likelihood of commitment.
I can see this theory in Mayor Pete’s interactions with other people. When Buttigieg is in the middle of a crowd, he elicits comfort and respect among his supporters. It’s obvious that he loves face-to-face contact with voters (unlike other politicians, who are happier on a podium). In a crowd, Buttigieg is relaxed and evidently interested in personally meeting others. He wants to convince others, and is enjoying himself. I respect his calming rhetoric and comforting tone. That’s why I trust Pete Buttigieg.
ROGER MASTERS

Gabbard soldiers on
In response to Taz Sibley’s Forum letter (“Tulsi Gabbard’s campaign has given me new hope,” Jan. 30): Hallelujah, brother. I couldn’t agree more. Gabbard has been minimized by the media, ignored by the Democratic National Committee, harassed by Hillary Clinton and still soldiers on. She polls as high or higher than Andrew Yang, Deval Patrick or Mike Bloomberg and yet CNN won’t even return her phone calls. This coming election is all about the people picking the candidate who is best for the position of president of the United States. This election is not about who the media thinks should be elected.
I ask all New Hampshire voters to do their homework and investigate all the candidates. In the end, I think they will agree that Gabbard is the right candidate. If you would like to meet Gabbard, hear what she has to offer, ask her direct questions and receive a direct answer, I urge you to go to the Fireside Inn on Thursday, at 6 p.m., and experience what I, Sibley and thousands of other New Hampshire residents have experienced: Tulsi Gabbard, the next president of the United States.

It all leads to McConnell
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is showing his true colors during the impeachment trial. He’s working desperately to ensure that President Donald Trump’s interests are protected. He has acted to block access to witnesses and documents. He has said there will be “no difference between the president’s position and our position,” and prejudged the trial’s outcome, saying there was “no chance” the Senate would vote to convict. Despite taking an oath to uphold “impartial justice,” McConnell undermines the core principle behind the rule of law that justice is blind and partisan identity should not influence a trial’s outcome.
McConnell’s actions should be no surprise. He has been called “the gravedigger of democracy.” McConnell expanded Newt Gingrich’s notion of tribal politics, announcing that his goal was to ensure that Barack Obama would be a one-term president. McConnell and his colleagues embarked on a strategy of obstruction. He refused to consider any Obama nominee for the Supreme Court vacancy after Antonin Scalia’s death. He flouted Senate norms with the secretive effort to repeal Obamacare. He refuses to take up the gun safety legislation passed by the House. Though the House passed more than 400 bills last year, about 80 percent of them are gathering dust in the Senate.
What to do? All roads lead to Mitch McConnell. In the words of New York Times columnist Gail Collins, the country’s been Mitchified. Let’s hope he’ll be defeated in Kentucky’s 2020 election. Let’s urge our senators to support their Republican colleagues in pressing McConnell to act on the stalled bills.

U.S. News: Antitrust Chief Recused in Google Probe

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- The Justice Department's chief antitrust enforcement official recused himself from the department's investigation into whether Alphabet Inc.'s Google is unlawfully suppressing competition.
The department said that as the probe progressed, Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim came to realize that he needed to recuse himself because of his past work in private practice.
Google was a onetime client. In 2007, Mr. Delrahim advised the search giant as it sought approval from the Federal Trade Commission to buy internet ad firm DoubleClick, an acquisition that helped make Google a dominant force in the digital-advertising ecosystem.
The recusal is the latest sign that the department regards Google's ad business as a top issue of concern. The company's digital-advertising practices have become an increasingly prominent focus of the investigation, and Mr. Delrahim and the department wanted to remove any appearance of a conflict of interest as the probe progresses further, people familiar with the matter said.
In addition to digital advertising, the department is continuing to examine Google's search and Android businesses as part of the probe, the people said.
Mr. Delrahim previously received ethics clearance to work on the Google probe, but the reversal came last week, after he and ethics officials took stock of recent advances in the Justice Department's investigation, the people said.
Mr. Delrahim "revisited potential conflicts with previous work with the Department of Justice's ethics office. He and the ethics office have decided that he should now recuse himself from a matter within the tech review in an abundance of caution," a department spokesman said.
The New York Times earlier reported Mr. Delrahim's recusal.
The department for months has been investigating Google, as well as conducting a broader probe into whether other tech giants, including Facebook Inc., are using their dominance in ways that violate U.S. antitrust law. The reviews are expected to last for much of 2020.
Mr. Delrahim isn't sidelined on all Big Tech matters, but his Google recusal brought immediate changes, including on Tuesday, when Mr. Delrahim didn't participate in a scheduled meeting between department officials and state attorneys general about their respective Google investigations.
Even before the recusal, Mr. Delrahim already had been ceding turf within the Justice Department on Big Tech, as top leadership has taken an unusually strong interest in antitrust enforcement against online platforms. Both Attorney General William Barr and Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen are playing an active role in the probes, and each has added antitrust lawyers to their offices.

Texto completo: NORFOLK - Democratic presidential candidate Mike Bloomberg will return to Norfolk Friday, according to a news release from his campaign.
He'll speak at Nauticus Friday morning about "presidential leadership and support for veterans and military families," according to the release.
This will be Bloomberg's second visit to Hampton Roads in recent months. He met with Del. Nancy Guy at D'Egg Diner in November in his first public appearance after announcing his run for president.
Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York City, recently opened campaign offices across Virginia and has plans for more, including Hampton Roads, according to his campaign.
Virginia voters will head to the polls March 3 for the presidential primary as one of 14 states holding primaries that day.
Bloomberg has largely avoided campaigning in the early caucus and primary states to focus on a national campaign and Super Tuesday states. He aired a campaign ad during the Super Bowl and has vowed to self-fund his campaign. The New York Times reported Tuesday that Bloomberg was doubling his ad spending following the Iowa caucuses.
Doors for the event open at 9:45 a.m. and the event is expected to start 30 minutes later. It is open to the public.

Hall of Fame Packers safety Wood dies at 83

Texto completo: Willie Wood was a fiercely athletic safety for the Green Bay Packers whose interception in Super Bowl I remains a cherished highlight for the organization.
Wood died Monday at an assisted living facility in his hometown of Washington, D.C., the Packers announced. He was 83.
Wood had been suffering from advanced dementia for years.
"The Green Bay Packers Family lost a legend today with the passing of Willie Wood," Packers President/CEO Mark Murphy said. "Willie's success story, rising from an undrafted rookie free agent to the Pro Football Hall of Fame, is an inspiration to generations of football fans. While his health challenges kept him from returning to Lambeau Field in recent years, his alumni weekend visits were cherished by both Willie and our fans. We extend our deepest condolences to Willie's family and friends."
The dynamic Wood was regarded as one of the best defensive backs in NFL history, a player whose vicious hits and plentiful interceptions dominated an entire decade in the 1960s. He played 12 seasons from 1960-71 — all with the Packers — and ranks second in franchise history with 48 career interceptions (trailing only Bobby Dillon's 52). Wood is the Packers' career leader in punt-return yardage with 1,391.
Wood was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1989.
"The game has lost a true legend with the passing of Willie Wood," Hall of Fame President & CEO David Baker said. "He had an unbelievable football career which helped transform Green Bay, Wisconsin into Titletown U.S.A. Willie was a rare player who always fought to be a great teammate and achieve success. He entered the league as an undrafted free agent and became one of the greatest to ever play the game. The Hall of Fame will forever keep his legacy alive to serve as inspiration to future generations."
Wood's streak of 166 consecutive games played ranks fourth behind quarterback Brett Favre (255), offensive lineman Forrest Gregg (167) and long snapper Rob Davis (167), a testament to the durability and attitude Wood hoped would define his game.
"Determination probably was my trademark," Wood said. "I was talented but so were a lot of people. I'd like people to tell you I was the toughest guy they ever played against."
Wood, who began his career as a quarterback, followed a circuitous route to Green Bay. A year of junior college in California gave way to a three-year career at Southern California with modest numbers and little national buzz. Wood went undrafted as an undersized black quarterback and relied instead on Bill Butler, his coach at the Washington, D.C., Boys Club, to write letters to pro teams campaigning on his behalf.
"Mr. Lombardi, if you could see this kid unshackled you would really agree with me," Butler said in a letter to coach Vince Lombardi in December of 1959. "If you hadn't contemplated giving him a chance, just try him one time and I'll guarantee you'll be glad you did."
Wood switched to defense and went through training camp with the Packers in 1960. He made the team as a rookie free agent and contributed immediately as a punt returner on special teams.
One year later, however, the legend of Wood was born. He replaced injured starter Jess Whittenton at safety late in the 1961 season and entrenched himself as one of the premier defensive backs in the league.
Wood made the Pro Bowl eight times in the next 11 seasons and led the Packers in interceptions five times. He earned AP All-Pro honors six times and was a unanimous selection in 1965 and 1966.
Wood retired after the 1971 season and took a job as an assistant coach for the San Diego Chargers. He went on to become the first black head coach in professional football by taking over the Philadelphia Bell of the World Football League in 1975. Five years later he became the first black head coach of the Canadian Football League as well.
"The thing is, my dad never wanted to leave football," Andre Wood, a son of Willie's, told The New York Times in an article published in 2016. "He needed a stable way to make a living. But I know he would have stayed in the NFL coaching track had he been asked to. But he wasn't."
Perhaps his finest moment came in Super Bowl I when the Packers played the Kansas City Chiefs. Wood undercut an ugly throw by Chiefs quarterback Len Dawson for an easy interception that, after a 50-yard return, set up a touchdown in what finished as a blowout win for the Packers.
"My dad was so proud of his Super Bowl moment, but I used to tease him about being tackled from behind on the play," Willie Wood Jr. told the Times.
"And his response would be, 'Yes, but I was there.'"
Wood, however, had no recollection of that play and hardly remembered his playing career at all. As detailed by the Times, the aging Wood spent the last decade in an assisted living facility in Washington. While he originally entered for chronic pain in his neck, hip and knee, Wood eventually developed dementia that sapped his memory and limited his cognitive functions.
He sometimes went days without speaking, according to the article.
"It's difficult to not be able to talk to him," Willie Wood Jr. told the Times. "He was a great father. As good an athlete as he was, he was 10 times that as a father."
Wood often wore a Packers hat during his time at the assisted living facility, even though he could not describe the exact connection between himself and the organization. But Wood knew he loved football, and when a reporter from the Times asked if he would play the sport again if given the chance, Wood's answer was simple.

Texto completo: Hollow-cheeked and shivering slightly in jeans he had outgrown, Abdullah stood in an unfinished parking garage, transfixed in front of a mural whose meaning he was eager to decode for a visitor.
"See, the man in the middle, he is asking the security forces, 'Please don't shoot us, we have nothing, nothing.' " Abdullah said the final word twice for emphasis as he earnestly studied the black-and-white image on the wall.
Drawn in charcoal in a socialist realist style, the mural, more than 12 feet long, showed a group of men walking forward and carrying their fallen friends in their arms. The men depicted were unmistakably Everyman laborers, with rough clothes and strained faces.
Abdullah, 18 -- a former cleaner in a hospital who asked that his surname not be used because he feared retribution for his involvement in anti-government protests -- is now an unofficial art guide to one of the most unlikely galleries imaginable: a 15-story shell of a structure, known locally by all as the Turkish Restaurant building, that looks over the Tigris River. It is the self-declared stronghold of Iraqis who oppose the country's leadership.
Covered on all sides by banners with messages to the government, to the security forces and to the world, the building looks like a ship about to set sail, with the slogans written on white cloth ballooning in the wind.
The first five floors have become one of the half-dozen major art venues that have sprung up in Baghdad around the protests as painters -- trained and untrained -- have turned walls, stairwells and littered parks into a vast canvas.
Where did all this art come from? How is it that a city where beauty and color has been largely suppressed for decades by poverty, and by the oppression or indifference of successive governments, suddenly came to be so alive?
"You know, we have many thoughts about Iraq, but no one from the government ever asked us," said Riad Rahim, 45, an art teacher.
The city's creative hub is Tahrir Square. Art covers the underpasses that run below it, the green space behind it, and the streets leading into it
The paintings, sculptures, photographs and shrines to killed protesters are political art of a kind rarely seen in Iraq, where art has been made for at least 10,000 years. It is as if an entire society is awakening to the sound of its own voice, and to the shape, size and sway of its creative force.
"In the beginning this was an uprising, but now it is a revolution," said Bassim al-Shadhir, an Iraqi-German who goes back and forth between the two countries and has participated in the protests. "There is art, there is theater, people are giving lectures and distributing books -- giving them away for free."
The artistic subjects and styles on view show how much a younger generation of Iraqis has been influenced by the internet, discovering there images that resonate with them and then drawing them with Iraqi touches.
Rosie the Riveter has an Iraqi flag on her check; Vincent Van Gogh's "Starry Night" has the Turkish Restaurant building in place of a cypress tree. Some paintings feature comic book characters, but wrapped in the Iraqi flag, the uniform of the protesters.
There are echoes of 1960s Pop Art in a painting of the Turkish Restaurant building with a red tuk-tuk flying out of the roof. The tuk-tuk is the protesters' mascot, a diesel-fueled, three-wheeled vehicle that requires no license to drive and has become the unofficial front-line ambulance, bearing the wounded to the first aid tents.
More than 500 protesters have been killed and thousands more have been injured.
Trees are another common subject, with painters in different locations in the Turkish Restaurant building drawing images of falling leaves.
"This tree is Iraq and I am going to write on each leaf the name of one of those martyred by the security forces," said Diana al-Qaisi, 32, who trained as an information systems engineer but now works in public relations.
"Its leaves are dropping because it is autumn and those who are trying to kill the tree are trying to kill the revolution," she said. "Even if they try, some leaves stay in the tree waiting to be born."
The country is witnessing an expressive flowering in more than the visual arts.
More than a dozen songs have been written for the protests and circulate nonstop on social media. Luminaries of the Iraqi arts -- actors and actresses, as well as musicians, painters and sculptors -- came together to record a tribute to the fallen protesters.
Recently, Rahim, the art teacher, was working with his friend, Hussein Shenshul, 41, who runs a clothing store, on a low-budget, high-concept sculpture project. They were painstakingly carving archaeologically accurate maquettes of six famous Iraqi sites, three ancient and three modern.
They had finished three -- the Al Hadba minaret in Mosul, which was destroyed in the fight with the Islamic State group; the ziggurat of Samarra; and the Turkish Restaurant building. They were working now on the Ishtar Gate, which once stood in ancient Babylon.
Their tools were foam, toothpicks, box cutters and spray paint for the background color, paintbrushes for the calligraphy.
"We want to express what the Iraqi civilization means," Rahim said. "We want to send a message to the world that this is our culture, we are educated, we are painters and poets, musicians and sculptors, this is what it means to be Iraqi."
"Everyone thinks Iraq is all wars and fighting," he added.
Outside the still unfinished Turkish Restaurant building -- so named because some 25 years ago it housed a Turkish restaurant on the ground floor -- Hussein Abdul Mufsin, 25, was finishing a mural on Sadoun Street. He had already painted four others -- a far cry from his usual work as a house painter.
Two murals depicted silhouettes of protesters trying to scale the barriers that divide them from the security forces. But today his primary painting goal was not art, but life. He was painting the lines that delineate the street's edges to keep cars from veering onto the curb.
"I brought my reflecting paint today from home because at night the government turns off all the electricity and the tuk-tuks carrying the injured cannot see the edge of the road and could crash," he said.
Why was he doing this?
"You could call it self-financing," he said, looking down shyly.
"Or maybe this is patriotism."

Many contenders but only one Golden Moutza winner

Texto completo: Was Bernie Sanders robbed once again of a clear victory speech in Iowa -- this time by that colossal counting fail at the Democratic caucuses on Tuesday, which allowed Joe Biden to pretend, at least for a few desperate hours, that he is still somewhat viable?
Yeah. Sure looks like absolute chaos going into New Hampshire.
And you know what billionaire Mike Bloomberg must be thinking:
Chaos is a ladder.
You don't need a box to climb it.
And chaos brings the moutza.
I wondered what CNN's Don Lemon would say, but he's too probably too busy unwittingly working to reelect President Donald Trump. Lemon is carrying on an idiotic trend in American journalism:
Ridiculing voters (and viewers and readers) if they don't agree with your politics.
As to the failure at the caucuses, blaming all Iowans is unfair. The caucuses are all about the grassroots, and about neighbors engaged in civic life. It is something to value. The people of Iowa didn't fail. The state Democratic Party failed them.
But we're not awarding the Golden Moutza of February, because today, The Golden Moutza of January is at hand.
Likewise, that J-Lo business at the Super Bowl halftime show.
Was J-Lo touching herself appropriate? Inappropriate? Empowering? Objectifying? Would Bill Clinton and the late Ted Kennedy have loved it?
"Don't go there," said a woman of J-Lo's age. OK, I won't.
Except to defend J-Lo's touching herself as absolutely appropriate -- if she were working in a strip club in Harvey.
Were those little girls with her up on stage, dressed all in white, empowered? By putting on the show, the NFL tells us there's nothing as empowering for young women as the sight of a 50-year old on a stripper pole.
But that's February. What of January?
"It's time to build a moutza machine that can work at 3,000 RPM," whined reader Bob Kit on social media, where the Golden Moutza nominations are made. "We just don't have the time to NAH! all those who truly deserve it."
The only man who could invent such a machine is the drunken scientific genius and space traveler Rick Sanchez of Rick and Morty cartoon fame. But he's trapped in a Pringles commercial.
"Too many possibilities," complained reader Kathleen Sawicki. "Can't you put all of them on a big wheel and we can spin? Spin is big these days!"
No spin, no wheels, no moutza machine. Just extend your naked palm at some moron worthy of contempt, spread your fingers wide and in the way of my ancient Greek ancestors, say Nah! (Here) or Feesah etho! (Blow on this.)
You can give a single, double, even a quadruple if you take your shoes and socks off.
"I challenge you to find a person who doesn't reside on party lines," said Leanne Edwards. "Someone whose conduct betrays common sense, but not blue nor red."
Nonpartisan? Like the hearing-impaired fellow who sued Pornhub for not including closed captioning of fake moans? Or the dentist who did a root canal while standing on a hoverboard?
"My head is spinning," complained Linda Feddor Cappozzo. "Each month it becomes more difficult to choose a worthy candidate!"
She settled giving a double to Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa, who wanted a contest to find a girlfriend he could take to the moon.
The 44-year-old fashion retail tycoon was searching for a "life partner" to join him on the moon in 2023, when he's scheduled to blast off in an Elon Musk rocket.
Maezawa insisted the woman must be female, single and over 20, and be ready to compete with other young women in a TV documentary. No word yet on any pole dancing.
He's since canceled his plan. But the moutza is valid. As Omar Khayyam might have written, if he thought of it, "The Moutza hand, having Moutzaed, moves on: nor all thy Piety nor Wit, nor all thy Tears wash out a Palm of it."
"He labeled his contest 'Full Moon Lovers," said Cappozzo. "Nah and Nah!"
"Jussie Smollett yet again, for going after (former Chicago police Superintendent) Eddie Johnson," said Lynda Vitale Turner. "He needs to slither away. Nah!"
But not before he endorses Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx.
"The royal McCaskey family for passing on (Super Bowl winning quarterback) Patrick Mahomes for Trubisky," writes an embittered Peter V. Bella. "Off with their heads! Nah!"
Peter, family matriarch Virginia McCaskey is not eligible. She's much too nice.
The reader known as Beer Girl demands an anti-moutza.
"I'm giving the Golden Beer Girl Award to members of the Australian Navy who delivered 800 gallons of beer to a fire-ravaged town during the wildfires," says Beer Girl. "Good job mates!"
Nice.
I tried to interest the judges in nonpolitical candidates, such as the deaf porn addict or the hoverboard dentist,. BUT many insisted on only one: Don Lemon.
In a recent CNN video clip that went viral, Lemon and two guests, a New York Times writer and a Never Trump Republican, mocked Trump voters as "credulous boomer rubes." They laughed and laughed, calling such voters ignorant, illiterate and dumb, and using fake Southern accents to put them in Hillary Clinton's basket of working class deplorables.
It was a stupid thing to do, but Lemon isn't alone. Americans see similar attitudes across journalism: If they disagree with a journalists' political beliefs, they're subject to public ridicule.
Politicians are always fair game for ridicule. But voters? No. That's bad journalism, bad politics and bad business.
"Does anyone remember when CNN used to be a real news station?" said Jim Arvites.
I do. There are exceptional journalists at CNN, such as Jake Tapper. But theatrical bozos in pursuit of personal glory can ruin their news operation's brand. The Trump campaign has made Lemon the star of a powerful commercial.
"I'm going with Don Lemon and crew," said Lori Trentanelli. "Nah! Feesah!"
"It has to be Don Lemon," said Joanne Makris Roloff. "Cackling like a hyena. Nah!"
This practice of ridiculing viewers (and readers) for their politics must end.
Lift your foolish face, Don Lemon. Behold, the Golden Moutza of January is at hand.
Laugh. Go ahead. Laugh.
Now blow on it.

BERNARD EBBERS: 1941-2020

Texto completo: Bernard J. Ebbers, who built a modest Mississippi phone company into a telecommunications giant, WorldCom, but later went to jail after its collapse in one of the nation's largest corporate scandals, died Sunday at his home in Brookhaven, Mississippi. He was 78.
His health had sharply deteriorated in recent months, his family said in a statement provided by his lawyer, Graham P. Carner, who confirmed the death. One of his daughters, Joy Ebbers Bourne, said in a court filing in October that Ebbers was "now experiencing full-blown dementia."
Ebbers, who in 2005 was sentenced to 25 years in prison, was freed from a federal prison in Texas in December, having been granted compassionate release by a federal judge to spend his final months at home.
In what was once considered a great entrepreneurial success story, Ebbers turned his small company in Mississippi, Long Distance Discount Service, into a telecommunications juggernaut, earning him the sobriquet "the telecom cowboy."
The company, renamed WorldCom, grew through an astonishing string of more than 40 mergers and acquisitions, including the $37 billion takeover in 1998 of MCI Communications, which was twice the size of WorldCom. At its peak in 1999, WorldCom employed 80,000 people and had a market capitalization of about $180 billion.
The company's sudden growth presented it with an array of new challenges, including placating federal regulators, courting multinational corporate customers and serving millions of residential customers.
But Ebbers minimized the immensity of his task.
"You know, it's not as complicated as people make it out to be," he told The New York Times in 1998 as he sat in the wood-paneled dining room of his 130-foot yacht, Countach, while it was berthed at Hilton Head, South Carolina.
He said he would succeed by relying on experts. "I'm not an engineer by training; I'm not an accountant by training," he said. "I'm the coach. I'm not the point guard who shoots the ball."
But the company's apparent growth turned out to be largely illusory, facilitated by accounting trickery. At his 2005 trial, held in Manhattan, former employees testified that Ebbers had urged them to inflate WorldCom's financial results to make the company appear more profitable than it was.
The jury convicted him of securities fraud, conspiracy and filing false reports, despite his argument that he had been misled by subordinates and in the dark about any wrongdoing.
His case was one of a slew notable corporate scandals in the first half of the last decade that caught up high-ranking executives, including Jeffrey Skilling at Enron, John Rigas at Adelphia Communications and Dennis Kozlowski at Tyco International.
But Ebbers' 25-year sentence was among the harshest ever imposed on a corporate executive.
"The problem is that Bernard Ebbers was transformed into a symbol of corporate corruption," Reid Weingarten, one of his lawyers, said after he was sentenced.
WorldCom had $107 billion in assets when it applied for bankruptcy protection in July 2002 -- the largest bankruptcy filing in United States corporate history at the time -- and its rapid fall reverberated throughout the industry. Thousands of WorldCom employees lost their jobs, insurance and pensions as well as their 401(k) retirement savings when the price of the company's stock plummeted.
Rival AT&T had laid off tens of thousands of its people in the late 1990s as it tried to chase WorldCom's phantom profits.
In 2005, Ebbers, who was once worth $1 billion on paper, surrendered nearly all of his remaining $40 million fortune to investors who had lost billions in the bankruptcy
The WorldCom scandal was the largest accounting scandal in American history until Bernie Madoff's Ponzi scheme, involving billions of dollars and thousands of victims, was revealed in 2008.
Bernard John Ebbers was born on Aug. 27, 1941, in Edmonton, Alberta, to John T. and Kathleen Mary (Ellen) Ebbers. His father was a traveling salesman and a mechanic, and her mother was a homemaker.
The family moved to California in the 1940s. Later, Bernie, as he was called, attended boarding school on a Navajo reservation. He ended up receiving a basketball scholarship -- he was 6-foot-4 tall -- to Mississippi College, a private Baptist institution in Clinton, Miss. He graduated in 1967 with a degree in physical education.
Ebbers married Linda Pigott in 1968, and they divorced in 1997. He and his second wife, Kristie Ebbers, who were married in 1999, divorced in 2008.
He is survived by four daughters, Ave Easley, Treasure Ebbers Beeson, Joy Ebbers Bourne and Faith Ebbers Gates; three brothers, John, James and Stephen; a sister, Marion Olthuis; 12 grandchildren; and one great-grandson.
Ebbers had been scheduled to be released from prison on July 4, 2028, but after more than 13 years of incarceration he was granted compassionate release on Dec. 21.
In a statement Monday, Bourne, one of his daughters, said the family understood that many of the victims of her father's scheme had opposed his early release. But, she said, she was grateful for Judge Valerie Caproni's judgment that keeping him in prison would not bring back anyone's investments.
She added that the Ebbers family would join a movement of people who are pressing for the compassionate release of ailing prisoners.

Texto completo: At a time when fear-of-the-other is stoked for votes, profits, laughs, you name it, it's refreshing to see a company double down on diversity in its bid for our hearts, minds and dollars.
Mattel released a new line of Barbie dolls last week. One doll has vitiligo, a condition that causes patches of skin and skin tissue to lose pigment.
"I think this is the best thing that could happen for children," Stella Pavlides, president and chief executive of the American Vitiligo Research Foundation, told The New York Times.
Another doll in the new lineup uses a wheelchair, and another has a prosthetic leg. The male doll has long, flowing hair, and one of the female dolls has no hair. It's a collection that reflects what America -- and American kids -- actually look like. (Except for the body type, which remains painfully, unrealistically Barbie-thin. But more on that later.)
The new lineup comes on the heels of Mattel's September release of Creatable World, a line of gender-neutral dolls that come in a range of skin colors. (Tagline: "a doll line designed to keep labels out and invite everyone in.")
For International Women's Day in 2018, Mattel released Frida Kahlo, Amelia Earhart and Katherine Johnson Barbies, expanding the role models that are placed in kids' hands when they play.
Do I wish the dolls' midsections were wide enough to house their vital organs? I do. Do I wish they had wrists that wouldn't fracture under the weight of a chunky bracelet, let alone a briefcase? I really do. Will I die on this particular hill? I probably will.
But praise where praise is due. If you're a brand, this has to be an incredibly tricky time to determine what you want to be known for, what you want to stand for, what you'll stick out your neck for.
Gillette rolled out its toxic masculinity commercial and watched as folks flushed their razors down the toilet.
Nike announced a Colin Kaepernick sponsorship and people started cutting the swooshes off their Nike socks.
The Hallmark Channel aired a commercial featuring a same-sex wedding and angry viewers threatened to boycott.
It's no time to stay silent on issues of justice and inclusion, but it's also not an easy time to be loud. Blowback and outrage are swift, and they've never had more platforms on which to thrive: Twitter. Facebook. Online petition sites. Email campaigns. Blogs.
In and among all that, it's a lovely ray of hope -- and maybe a guiding light -- to watch a toy company try to win by reaching kids who might be transgender, might have a misunderstood skin condition, might use a wheelchair, might not have hair on their heads, might not look how dolls and commercials and magazines and TV shows and movies and billboards have always told them they should look. Even if they catch flak from people who want their Barbies to remain in their traditional Barbie mold.
Now, if we could just work on getting a little more (thermoplastic polymer) meat on their bones.

Texto completo: BAGHDAD - Hollow-cheeked and shivering slightly in jeans he had outgrown, Abdullah stood in an unfinished parking garage, transfixed in front of a mural whose meaning he was eager to decode for a visitor.
"See, the man in the middle, he is asking the security forces, 'Please don't shoot us, we have nothing, nothing.' " Abdullah said the final word twice for emphasis as he earnestly studied the black-and-white image on the wall.
Drawn in charcoal in a socialist realist style, the mural, more than 12 feet long, showed a group of men walking forward and carrying their fallen friends in their arms. The men depicted were unmistakably Everyman laborers, with rough clothes and strained faces.
Abdullah, 18 - a former cleaner in a hospital who asked that his surname not be used because he feared retribution for his involvement in anti-government protests - is now an unofficial art guide to one of the most unlikely galleries imaginable: a 15-story shell of a structure, known locally by all as the Turkish Restaurant building, that looks over the Tigris River. It is the self-declared stronghold of Iraqis who oppose the country's leadership.
Covered on all sides by banners with messages to the government, to the security forces and to the world, the building looks like a ship about to set sail, with the slogans written on white cloth ballooning in the wind.
The first five floors have become one of the half-dozen major art venues that have sprung up in Baghdad around the protests as painters - trained and untrained - have turned walls, stairwells and littered parks into a vast canvas.
Where did all this art come from? How is it that a city where beauty and color has been largely suppressed for decades by poverty, and by the oppression or indifference of successive governments, suddenly came to be so alive?
"You know, we have many thoughts about Iraq, but no one from the government ever asked us," said Riad Rahim, 45, an art teacher.
The city's creative hub is Tahrir Square. Art covers the underpasses that run below it, the green space behind it, and the streets leading into it
The paintings, sculptures, photographs and shrines to killed protesters are political art of a kind rarely seen in Iraq, where art has been made for at least 10,000 years. It is as if an entire society is awakening to the sound of its own voice, and to the shape, size and sway of its creative force.
"In the beginning this was an uprising, but now it is a revolution," said Bassim al-Shadhir, an Iraqi-German who goes back and forth between the two countries and has participated in the protests. "There is art, there is theater, people are giving lectures and distributing books - giving them away for free."
The artistic subjects and styles on view show how much a younger generation of Iraqis has been influenced by the internet, discovering there images that resonate with them and then drawing them with Iraqi touches.
Rosie the Riveter has an Iraqi flag on her check; Vincent Van Gogh's "Starry Night" has the Turkish Restaurant building in place of a cypress tree. Some paintings feature comic book characters, but wrapped in the Iraqi flag, the uniform of the protesters.
There are echoes of 1960s Pop Art in a painting of the Turkish Restaurant building with a red tuk-tuk flying out of the roof. The tuk-tuk is the protesters' mascot, a diesel-fueled, three-wheeled vehicle that requires no license to drive and has become the unofficial front-line ambulance, bearing the wounded to the first aid tents.
More than 500 protesters have been killed and thousands more have been injured.
Trees are another common subject, with painters in different locations in the Turkish Restaurant building drawing images of falling leaves.
"This tree is Iraq and I am going to write on each leaf the name of one of those martyred by the security forces," said Diana al-Qaisi, 32, who trained as an information systems engineer but now works in public relations.
"Its leaves are dropping because it is autumn and those who are trying to kill the tree are trying to kill the revolution," she said. "Even if they try, some leaves stay in the tree waiting to be born."
The country is witnessing an expressive flowering in more than the visual arts.
More than a dozen songs have been written for the protests and circulate nonstop on social media. Luminaries of the Iraqi arts - actors and actresses, as well as musicians, painters and sculptors - came together to record a tribute to the fallen protesters.
Recently, Rahim, the art teacher, was working with his friend, Hussein Shenshul, 41, who runs a clothing store, on a low-budget, high-concept sculpture project. They were painstakingly carving archaeologically accurate maquettes of six famous Iraqi sites, three ancient and three modern.
They had finished three - the Al Hadba minaret in Mosul, which was destroyed in the fight with the Islamic State group; the ziggurat of Samarra; and the Turkish Restaurant building. They were working now on the Ishtar Gate, which once stood in ancient Babylon.
Their tools were foam, toothpicks, box cutters and spray paint for the background color, paintbrushes for the calligraphy.
"We want to express what the Iraqi civilization means," Rahim said. "We want to send a message to the world that this is our culture, we are educated, we are painters and poets, musicians and sculptors, this is what it means to be Iraqi."
"Everyone thinks Iraq is all wars and fighting," he added.
Outside the still unfinished Turkish Restaurant building - so named because some 25 years ago it housed a Turkish restaurant on the ground floor - Hussein Abdul Mufsin, 25, was finishing a mural on Sadoun Street. He had already painted four others - a far cry from his usual work as a house painter.
Two murals depicted silhouettes of protesters trying to scale the barriers that divide them from the security forces. But today his primary painting goal was not art, but life. He was painting the lines that delineate the street's edges to keep cars from veering onto the curb.
"I brought my reflecting paint today from home because at night the government turns off all the electricity and the tuk-tuks carrying the injured cannot see the edge of the road and could crash," he said.
Why was he doing this?
"You could call it self-financing," he said, looking down shyly.
"Or maybe this is patriotism."

The world of mezcal evolves and grows

Texto completo: From the consumer's view, the world of mezcal in 2020 is radically different from that of 10 years ago. Del Maguey, which 25 years ago pioneered the discovery and marketing in the United States of small-production, geographically specific bottles, is still going strong, though its visionary founder, Ron Cooper, sold a controlling interest in the brand to the beverage giant Pernod Ricard in 2017.
Rather than packaging his discoveries as a luxury brand or with celebrity tie-ins in the fashion of tequila, mezcal's agave cousin, Cooper emphasized the cultural significance of mezcal, highlighting its ability - through traditional, laborious methods of production - to transmit the character of a place and a people.
But where 10 years ago, Del Maguey alone seemed to be shining a light on the enormous potential and complexity of mezcal, now more than a few entrepreneurs, no doubt inspired by Cooper's example, have entered the artisanal mezcal business.
While "artisanal" has become a marketing buzzword, it seems to mean something more with mezcal. Entrepreneurs with dollar signs in their eyes have gotten into the act, no surprise, but the best and most interesting bottles are still the most rustic and distinctive, rather than the most polished.
Nowadays, dozens of small-production bottles are available, each highlighting the styles of small mezcaleros, or mezcal makers, local production techniques and the various sorts of agaves that are permitted to be used in mezcal production.
Unlike tequila, which can be produced only from the blue agave in the state of Jalisco and a few surrounding areas, mezcal can legally be made in 10 Mexican states with any sort of agave.
Practically speaking, though, most mezcal comes from Oaxaca, and most of the time it's made from the espadín agave. Yet it's not rare to find mezcals made of other sorts of agaves with names like barril, jabalí, cuishe, tepeztate and tobalá.
To get a sense of the evolved world of mezcal today, the spirits panel recently tasted 20 bottles. For the tasting, Florence Fabricant of The New York Times and I were joined by two drinks writers and historians, David Wondrich and Robert Simonson.
Mezcal, like tequila, often comes with an age statement: joven, or young; reposado, which is aged in oak for up to a year, and añejo, which is aged one to three years. I love the purity of agave spirits undistorted by oak, so for this tasting we stuck to joven.
As usual, we bought all the bottles retail, and we capped the selections at $100 a bottle, which ruled out quite a few. Even without the most expensive choices, we all marveled at the high level of quality in the tasting. We were floored by the wide variety of flavors, complex and strange in the best possible way.
In the past I had come to think of smokiness as the defining feature of mezcal. In this tasting, smokiness, which comes from roasting the agaves in rock-lined pits before fermentation, was just one of many components.
We found aromas and flavors of herbs, vegetables, jalapeños, flowers and a lot more, often in combinations that seemed to vary widely from bottle to bottle.
What accounts for such variety? Partly, it's a reflection of the diversity of raw materials. Agaves take a long time to grow, and can vary in age. Some are harvested after five years, others after many more.
It's also a function of production techniques - copper pot stills are most common, for example, but some mezcaleros still use clay stills.
Local traditions differ as well. Sometimes mezcals are redistilled with grains or nuts to add flavor.
It's often said by mezcal enthusiasts that the spirit needs to be at least 45% alcohol to show its true character. Perhaps that's true. Seven bottles in our tasting had alcohol levels under 45%, and only two of those made our top 10.
Our top bottle was the Rezpiral Abel Martínez Series Four, named after the mezcalero who produced it. It was briny, deep and complex with a pronounced saline quality.
No. 2 was the subtle, complex, lightly smoky Agave de Cortés Espadín, the sort of spirit in which you seem to taste something different with every sip. By contrast, the No. 3 Sombra was rich, deep and assertive, though not as complex. At $35, it was also our best value.
I recognize that many of these mezcals may be difficult to find. The good news is that even if you cannot find the precise bottles that we tasted, many of these brands offer a variety of different bottlings, made by other mezcaleros in different villages using their own techniques and sometimes other sorts of agaves.
They are all worth trying. No doubt, you will find favorites that we did not taste. With mezcal circa 2020, discovery is part of the thrill.

Texto completo: "Can Democrats Win Back Trump Voters -- Without Compromising Their Soul?" That's the question asked by the left-progressive weekly The Nation. But I have a better one: Can Bernie Sanders win Joe Rogan's audience without losing his dignity?
As you may have heard by now, the presidential hopeful and democratic socialist senator from Vermont has won the widely coveted -- and also widely reviled -- endorsement of Joe Rogan, the actor-comedian who also ranks No. 1 on Forbes' inaugural list of the highest-earning podcasters.
Rogan, the former host of "Fear Factor" -- a TV contest show in which he coaxed contestants to eat bugs, among other stunts, for money -- made $30 million last year. Yes, there is life after television.
Rogan voiced support for Sanders during a Jan. 21 podcast episode featuring New York Times opinion columnist Bari Weiss after interviewing Sanders on an earlier episode: "I think I'll probably vote for Bernie. ... I believe in him, I like him a lot."
And the news of Rogan's endorsement came just before a new NBC/Wall Street Journal poll released last week that, for the first time, found Sanders had inched ahead of the pack to be the top choice of Democratic voters nationally. His 27% essentially tied Joe Biden, who scored 26% after weeks of having occupied the top spot in previous Journal/NBC polls by himself.
But after the Sanders campaign happily shared the video of Rogan's comments on social media, the progressive-wing candidate was bombarded with, of all things, complaints from a high-class assortment of the left-progressive voices who did not approve.
MoveOn.org, for example, said Sanders should apologize for highlighting Rogan's endorsement. The Human Rights Campaign, a major LGBTQ rights organization, said it was "disappointing" that Sanders had "accepted and promoted the endorsement."
Writer Donna Minkowitz spoke for many, I'm sure, in an essay in The Nation, headlined, "Bernie Broke My Heart When He Embraced Rogan's Endorsement" and "I've been a lifelong socialist and a supporter of Sanders since the 1980s. I expected better from the senator."
I understand. On his freewheeling talkathon, Rogan has used the N-word, if only to chastise someone else for using it. He infamously described how visiting a black neighborhood to see "Planet of the Apes" made him feel like he, too, was visiting the "planet of the apes."
He also occasionally has given a platform to far-out conspiracy theorists such as Alex Jones and provocateurs such as Milo Yiannopoulos. Although, as my son -- who stays in tune with the morning-zoo sectors of the internet better than I do -- pointed out, Rogan did the world a favor. He was the interviewer who drew out the pedophile-tolerant quotes of former Breitbart editor Yiannopoulos that sunk his invitation to speak at the Conservative Political Action Conference, or CPAC, among other lucrative speaking gigs.
Rogan was accused in 2013 of making transphobic comments about UFC fighter Fallon Fox, a trans woman, who was criticized for beating two women in matches before announcing that she used to be a man. Rogan was hardly the only voice to criticize the shaky ethics of Fox's move.
But, before we roll out the tumbrels to cart Sanders off to cancel-culture jail, consider the provocative question raised later in The Nation by Chicago-based podcaster Edward Burmila: "Beating Trump Is the Goal. What if Joe Rogan Fans Will Help?"
Burmila, described as working on a book about "why the Democrats are so bad at politics," says much of value, but to me this line stuck out: "Elections and politics are about winning power, and it requires selective memory to pretend that winning the White House in 2008 and 2012, or the House in 2018, did not require swallowing hard on a lot of compromises aimed at courting conservatives."
True that. I'm not the world's biggest Sanders fan. His insistence on eliminating private insurance companies in his "Medicare for All" vision is too far left for me. But politics should be a game of addition, not subtraction. Before Donald Trump came along, it usually was.
By focusing so narrowly, Trump offers Democrats a gift: a vast multitude of swing voters and disaffected nonvoters who are looking to be persuaded by a reasonable alternative. At least, Sanders is trying to fill that gap. He shouldn't be alone.

Texto completo: From the consumer's view, the world of mezcal in 2020 is radically different from that of 10 years ago. Del Maguey, which 25 years ago pioneered the discovery and marketing in the United States of small-production, geographically specific bottles, is still going strong, though its visionary founder, Ron Cooper, sold a controlling interest in the brand to the beverage giant Pernod Ricard in 2017.
Rather than packaging his discoveries as a luxury brand or with celebrity tie-ins in the fashion of tequila, mezcal's agave cousin, Cooper emphasized the cultural significance of mezcal, highlighting its ability -- through traditional, laborious methods of production -- to transmit the character of a place and a people.
But where 10 years ago, Del Maguey alone seemed to be shining a light on the enormous potential and complexity of mezcal, now more than a few entrepreneurs, no doubt inspired by Cooper's example, have entered the artisanal mezcal business.
While "artisanal" has become a marketing buzzword, it seems to mean something more with mezcal. Entrepreneurs with dollar signs in their eyes have gotten into the act, no surprise, but the best and most interesting bottles are still the most rustic and distinctive, rather than the most polished.
Nowadays, dozens of small-production bottles are available, each highlighting the styles of small mezcaleros, or mezcal makers, local production techniques and the various sorts of agaves that are permitted to be used in mezcal production.
Unlike tequila, which can be produced only from the blue agave in the state of Jalisco and a few surrounding areas, mezcal can legally be made in 10 Mexican states with any sort of agave.
Practically speaking, though, most mezcal comes from Oaxaca, and most of the time it's made from the espadín agave. Yet it's not rare to find mezcals made of other sorts of agaves with names like barril, jabalí, cuishe, tepeztate and tobalá.
To get a sense of the evolved world of mezcal today, the spirits panel recently tasted 20 bottles. For the tasting, Florence Fabricant of The New York Times and I were joined by two drinks writers and historians, David Wondrich and Robert Simonson.
Mezcal, like tequila, often comes with an age statement: joven, or young; reposado, which is aged in oak for up to a year, and añejo, which is aged one to three years. I love the purity of agave spirits undistorted by oak, so for this tasting we stuck to joven.
As usual, we bought all the bottles retail, and we capped the selections at $100 a bottle, which ruled out quite a few. Even without the most expensive choices, we all marveled at the high level of quality in the tasting. We were floored by the wide variety of flavors, complex and strange in the best possible way.
In the past I had come to think of smokiness as the defining feature of mezcal. In this tasting, smokiness, which comes from roasting the agaves in rock-lined pits before fermentation, was just one of many components.
We found aromas and flavors of herbs, vegetables, jalapeños, flowers and a lot more, often in combinations that seemed to vary widely from bottle to bottle.
What accounts for such variety? Partly, it's a reflection of the diversity of raw materials. Agaves take a long time to grow, and can vary in age. Some are harvested after five years, others after many more.
It's also a function of production techniques -- copper pot stills are most common, for example, but some mezcaleros still use clay stills.
Local traditions differ as well. Sometimes mezcals are redistilled with grains or nuts to add flavor.
It's often said by mezcal enthusiasts that the spirit needs to be at least 45% alcohol to show its true character. Perhaps that's true. Seven bottles in our tasting had alcohol levels under 45%, and only two of those made our top 10.
Our top bottle was the Rezpiral Abel Martínez Series Four, named after the mezcalero who produced it. It was briny, deep and complex with a pronounced saline quality.
No. 2 was the subtle, complex, lightly smoky Agave de Cortes Espadín, the sort of spirit in which you seem to taste something different with every sip. By contrast, the No. 3 Sombra was rich, deep and assertive, though not as complex. At $35, it was also our best value.
I recognize that many of these mezcals may be difficult to find. The good news is that even if you cannot find the precise bottles that we tasted, many of these brands offer a variety of different bottlings, made by other mezcaleros in different villages using their own techniques and sometimes other sorts of agaves.
They are all worth trying. No doubt, you will find favorites that we did not taste. With mezcal circa 2020, discovery is part of the thrill.

Texto completo: Picked-up pieces while waiting endlessly for Tom Brady to tell us where he's playing next season . . . for the Red Sox to hire a manager . . . for Rob Manfred to tell us whether the 2018 Red Sox were cheating . . . for Danny Ainge to acquire a big man before Thursday's NBA trading deadline . . .
■ Imagine my surprise when I heard a guy from San Francisco talking about his region as a home of sports champions. Doesn't everybody know that Boston is Titletown, USA? Twelve duck boat parades in this century?
It turns out that the Bay area has been our equal over the last decade, and if the 49ers had prevailed Sunday, that region would have more championships than Boston since 2010. Instead, we are tied with six crowns and 11 appearances in finals over the last decade.
Since 2010, the Bay area has won three World Series (Giants in 2010, 2012, 2014) and three NBA crowns (Warriors 2015, 2017, 2018). In addition, its teams have been in five other championship rounds (2012 Niners, 2016 Sharks and Warriors, 2019 Warriors, and 2019 49ers). Boston since 2010 has six championships in 11 finals (Celtics 0-1, Bruins 1-2, Patriots 3-2, Red Sox 2-0).
■ I remain dazzled at Brady's obsession with all things TB12. He's worse than Gwyneth Paltrow with Goop. Now we're hearing that “incorporating" TB12 into a franchise could be part of Brady's next contract negotiation.
Does Brady really think his high-end, unconventional workout/product corporation is going to become a thriving, global, money-making entity? Call me a small thinker, but I am dubious.
We're all glad it works for Tom, but I see it as unlikely that TB12 will have much impact once Brady is through playing professional football. (At least Brady is not asking to take a bath with taxpayer money, in the fashion of 38 Studios.)
■ Hats off to Bruins captain Zdeno Chara, who'll be honored for reaching the 1,500-game plateau — more than 1,000 with the Bruins — before Saturday's Bruins-Coyotes game at the Garden. The only men who've played more games for the Bruins are Ray Bourque, Johnny Bucyk, Patrice Bergeron, Don Sweeney, and Wayne Cashman.
■ Manfred should hire Ed Davis to crack the case in the Red Sox alleged cheating investigation.
■ Sorry, but David Ortiz shilling for Sox management regarding the “need" to trade Betts is the height of hypocrisy. No big league star complained more about his own contract than Ortiz. Now Big Papi is a company man, delivering the party line for Sox owners.
■ Red Sox mystery man Michael Gordon is quoted in the new Sports Illustrated talking about Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp. Gordon, president of Fenway Sports Group, is described by the magazine as “intensely private." He's also the man who was listed above Larry Lucchino on the club website a few months before Lucchino was bumped from power in the summer of 2015.
■ Every time I see the “new," shrinking Rob Gronkowski, he looks more like the late David Bowie.
■ Quiz: Name five pitchers who started a World Series game for the Red Sox in this century and also won a World Series with another team. (Answer below.)
■ I know it's a topic, but I have spent zero seconds wondering or caring whether Eli Manning will be a Hall of Famer. Eli won one more Super Bowl MVP than his brother Peyton, but threw a whopping 244 interceptions to go with his 366 touchdown passes.
■ The Sports Hub's Marc Bertrand has a good idea to address NBA tanking. “Beetle" suggests that the NBA take all non-playoff teams and put them in a postseason tournament to determine the order at the top of the next draft. The team that wins the tournament of losers gets the No. 1 pick.
■ UMass athletic director Ryan Bamford last month penned a lengthy football manifesto titled “A Strategic Vision for Massachusetts Football." The AD wrote, “One myth that has been cited by the public is the supposed negative financial impact football at UMass has on the taxpayers of the Commonwealth. The belief that football is a drain on state funds is wholly inaccurate."
I had trouble following the math, but evidently the 1-11 team that draws few fans and operates on a $4.225 million budget is hardly costing taxpayers anything at all.
Bamford concluded, “We have reimagined important programmatic areas over this past year, something that was needed to achieve ultimate success. Our progress in these areas has me extremely bullish about our future."
The 2019 Minutemen set a record for defensive futility, giving up a whopping 52.7 points per game. Good seats are available for this year's home opener, Sept. 12 vs. Troy. UMass's Nov. 14 game at Auburn should be a barn-burner.
■ The New York Post ranked the top radio/television sports calls of all time and came up with Al Michaels's “Do you believe in miracles? Yes!" as No. 1. Russ Hodges's “The Giants win the pennant!" was second, and Howard Cosell's “Down goes Frazier!" was third.
Boston was represented by Vin Scully's “Gets through Buckner" (No. 5) and Johnny Most's “Havlicek stole the ball!" (No. 6).
■ New Giants head coach Joe Judge lived next door to the late Aaron Hernandez in North Attleborough when the two both worked for the Patriots. Judge's uncle, Jerry Judge, was a boxer who was KO'd by George Foreman in an exhibition bout.
■ Jim Calhoun, who put Northeastern basketball on the map, doesn't get much love at the Huskies' home gym. Calhoun is represented on a historical timeline display in the men's locker room, but there's no trace of his accomplishments for fans attending games at Matthews Arena.
■ Talented author Jeff Pearlman will be out in September with “Three-Ring Circus: Shaq, Kobe, Phil, and the Crazy Years of the Lakers Dynasty" (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt). The book was completed before Kobe Bryant's sudden death, but will include a prologue addressing it.
■ Speaking of Kobe, all Celtics fans know that the great Sam Jones — winner of 10 championship rings — retired No. 24 for the Green.
■ Boston anesthesiologist Antje Barreveld was voted Most Likely To Succeed along with Bryant when the two were seniors at Lower Merion High School in Ardmore, Pa., in 1996.
■ It's official: Tony Eason is still the only Super Bowl starting quarterback who failed to complete a pass in the game. Eason went 0 for 6 for the Patriots vs. the Bears before he was mercifully replaced by Steve Grogan.
■ This weekend is the 20th anniversary of Hot Stove Cool Music, and the show will be at the Paradise Rock Club Saturday night at 7:30. All for the benefit of the Foundation To Be Named Later. For information, go to FTBNL.org.
■ I needed to watch six hours of Super Bowl pregame to learn that Alex Rodriguez wore No. 13 as an homage to Dan Marino.
■ Good luck to the Massachusetts Coalition to Preserve Girls Field Hockey in its quest to stop the nonsense of a handful of boys playing and dominating a sport with rosters that have been traditionally 100 percent female. It's a joke and a litigious nightmare. The MIAA needs to figure it out.
■ Thought you should know that from 1954-58, the Cincinnati Reds changed their team name to “Redlegs" to avoid being associated with Communism.
■ Jackie Bradley Jr. turns 30 April 19. Just sayin'.
■ Quiz answer: Curt Schilling, John Lackey, Jon Lester, Josh Beckett, and Jake Peavy (thanks, Tyler Kepner of the New York Times).

26.2-mile fountain of youth?

Texto completo: Complete a first marathon and rejuvenate a major artery. That is the message of an inspiring new study of novice runners and their aortas.
The study finds that training for and finishing a marathon can spruce up arteries, leaving them more flexible, healthy and biologically younger than before, even if runners are older or slow.
But the study also raises some pointed questions about whether a lone marathon is the ideal goal for people hoping to improve their arterial health over the long term.
Inside most of us who are middle-aged or older, arteries are hardening. Our arteries, of course, carry oxygenated blood from our hearts and, when healthy and pliable, expand and contract like bellows as blood pulses through them, keeping the flow smooth and steady.
But with age, our arteries' elasticity declines and they stiffen. Blood begins to jostle and crowd against the vessels' inflexible walls, blood pressure rises, and organs that require an even, gentle stream of blood, like the kidneys and brain, can be affected.
Helpfully, some past research hints that exercise might alter this age-related arterial stiffening. Longtime older athletes, for instance, tend to have relatively supple, responsive arteries.
But most people are not longtime, competitive athletes, and it has not been clear if sedentary people can start to exercise and still improve the state of their arteries.
So, for the new study, which was published in January in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, researchers at University College London and other institutions decided to track the arteries of a group of people who were new to exercise, targeting first-time entrants in an upcoming London Marathon.
The researchers zeroed in on race participants who had reported on entry forms that they were newcomers to the sport and to exercise in general, rarely working out before signing up. The scientists found more than 200 of these men and women, most of them middle-aged and all sedentary, and contacted them six months before race time.
These soon-to-be marathoners agreed to visit the university's lab, completing health and fitness tests and a sophisticated scan of their aorta, designed to measure its flexibility. None of the group showed signs of heart disease or other serious health problems.
Each runner then began his or her preferred marathon-training program, with most jogging a few times a week. This training continued for six months, although some developed injuries or other concerns and dropped out. Ultimately, 136 men and women completed the race, in an average finishing time of 4.5 hours for the men and 5.5 hours for the women. A week or two later, they returned to the lab to repeat the tests.
Their aortas proved to be more flexible now. In fact, their arteries seemed to have shed the equivalent of about four years, in functional terms. The aorta of a 60-year-old marathoner in the study now expanded and contracted about as lithely as that of a 56-year-old participant did at the study's start, and the 56-year-old's arteries worked like those of a prerace 52-year-old, and so on.
These improvements were most marked in older male runners and those whose finishing times had been slowest. They did not depend on changes in runners' fitness or weight, which, in most cases, had been negligible. All that had mattered was that people had kept up with their training and raced.
These findings gratified the researchers, said Dr. Charlotte Manisty, a consulting cardiologist at University College London and the Barts Heart Center, who oversaw the new study. "We had not really known" whether the arteries of sedentary people "could or would benefit" from exercise training, she said, especially if the people were older or notably out of shape. "We just didn't know how much plasticity their arteries still had."
The answer seems to have been plenty, however, she said. "Almost everyone benefited," Manisty said, "and those people whose arteries needed the most help benefited the most."
But these results do not consider the large number of would-be marathon racers in the study who did not make it to the start line. It is also unknown whether the rejuvenation of runners' aortas is likely to last or if the benefits will be lost if they do not continue to run.
"Exercise is great for the entire body, including the arteries," said Dr. Julio Chirinos, an associate professor at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, who wrote an editorial accompanying the new study.
It's also uncertain whether someone must go the full 26.2 miles to improve arterial health, Chirinos said. "Is this the best dose" of exercise to produce healthier, more-youthful arteries, he asked. Perhaps less training would be sufficient, or different exercises of varying intensities, or any routine people will continue for the long haul.
Manisty agreed. "We really do not know the threshold amount of exercise needed" to gain the benefits seen in her study, she said.
But she and her colleagues expect in the future to study the effects of training for other, shorter events and also include people who have existing heart disease, high blood pressure and other health concerns.

What we know about Nevada's caucus app

Texto completo: The Nevada State Democratic Party says it will not host a repeat of the democratic debacle still playing out in Iowa.
The Silver State's third-in-the-nation nominating contest is, like Iowa's, a party-run, app-based process seemingly susceptible to the type of widespread technical difficulties that wreaked havoc on Monday's voting results out of the Midwest.
That's prompted party bigwigs to try to ease concerns about their own technology with a Tuesday statement that predicts Nevada caucusgoers will have a much smoother experience.
"NV Dems can confidently say that what happened in the Iowa caucus last night will not happen in Nevada on February 22," said Party Chair William McCurdy. "We will not be employing the same app or vendor used in the Iowa caucus.
"We had already developed a series of backups and redundant reporting systems, and are currently evaluating the best path forward."
Hours later, ex-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid sought to buttress those claims with brief statement of his own.
"In Nevada, we have built the best state party operation in the country," Reid tweeted. "I am 100% confident that what happened in Iowa will not happen in Nevada."
Party officials have not volunteered further details on their backup vote-reporting plan, nor any specifics on the contractors hired to help implement a raft of voter-friendly changes expected during the state's upcoming caucus.
Neither state party — Iowa's or Nevada's — has disclosed the companies contracted to develop their Caucus Day apps, though reports filed with the Federal Election Commission show both paid roughly five-figure sums for technology services provided by a firm called Shadow Inc.
That company has since been identified by several news outlets as the developer behind Iowa's glitchy software. Company officials on Tuesday tweeted an apology directed to the candidates, campaigns and caucusgoers affected by Monday's severe vote-tallying delays.
McCurdy did not immediately return requests for comment on Nevada Democrats relationship with the company.
A party spokeswoman did not respond to the Reno Gazette Journal's questions about the technology on Monday night or Tuesday morning. Alana Mounce, the party's executive director, also could not be reached.
Here's what we know about what happened in Iowa and what it means for Nevada:
What's this about an app used in the caucuses? Democrats in Iowa and Nevada had hoped to host pioneering virtual caucuses this month, only to see that idea shot down by Democratic National Committee members worried about a host of "unresolved security concerns."
Instead, officials opted to develop smartphone apps meant to boost turnout and help caucus managers quickly transmit voting results to party headquarters and the public.
The Iowa Democratic Party has said its app was tested by an independent third party, but did not release too much information about it, the Des Moines Register reported. That's because top cybersecurity experts said revealing too many details could result in the developer being targeted.
Nevada Democrats have been slightly less tight-lipped about their app's rollout, revealing some specifics that could bode well, or poorly, for caucusgoers on Feb. 22.
Nevadans, for example, will use two different apps to pick their preferred Democratic presidential candidate — one for crunching numbers on Caucus Day, and another for caucusgoers who turn out during the state's expanded, four-day early voting period.
The latter app will be downloaded to thousands of party-purchased iPads that will also help caucus workers register new voters at the polls. The former app will be used to tally up a candidate's supporters and translate the results into a delegate count later used to determine a winner.
But if something goes wrong along the way, Nevada caucus workers may find themselves in much the same position as Iowans were on Monday: Stuck on the phone while overwhelmed party officials scramble to manually log results that were supposed to be relayed by the app.
It's unclear how many staffers Nevada party officials plan to have manning the phones in the event of such a malfunction.
What's known is that Nevada, like Iowa, will retain a paper copy of caucusgoers preferences as a failsafe agaisnt technological meltdowns. That means everyone's vote will count, even if it takes some time.
So what was the issue in Iowa? Early in the evening, party officials began reporting that some precinct officials could not log into the app. One issue apparently was confusion with PIN numbers, reported KCRG, a Cedar Rapids, Iowa, ABC television station.
Precinct chairwoman Ruth Thompson told KCRG that organizers had problems trying to download and test the app. "We came to a consensus not to use it," said Thompson, who chaired a precinct at Lincoln High School in Des Moines.
Emily Duff, who volunteered as a captain for Bernie Sanders' campaign Monday night, expressed concerns about the app before her caucus, she told the Des Moines Register. Duff's precinct in the gym at Hoover High School in Des Moines wound up reporting results manually, she said.
"People were having issues, so they ditched the app," she said.
Precinct chairs did not have to use the app but could also tabulate results manually – a paper trail is included as a planned redundancy in the system – and call them into a hotline. But telephones were jammed, too.
"We understand that caucus chairs are attempting to – and, in many cases, failing to –report results telephonically to the party. These acute failures are occurring statewide," wrote Dana Remus, general counsel for Biden for President, in a letter to the Iowa Democratic Party executive director Kevin Geiken and chairman Troy Price late Monday, saying the party's new app and its backup phone hotline failed, the Register reported.
So did the app work or not? Apparently, when the app was used to report results, not all of the data came through, a discrepancy officials noted Monday night, but could not explain at the time.
""As part of our investigation, we determined with certainty that the underlying data collected via the app was sound. While the app was recording data accurately, it was reporting out only partial data," Iowa Democratic Party Chair Troy Price said in a statement Tuesday morning. "We have determined that this was due to a coding issue in the reporting system. This issue was identified and fixed. The application's reporting issue did not impact the ability of precinct chairs to report data accurately."
The system's redundant paper trail is being used to verify and calculate the results, he said. "While our plan is to release results as soon as possible today, our ultimate goal is to ensure that the integrity and accuracy of the process continues to be upheld."
What's this about Shadow and where did the app come from? The New York Times has reported that the app's developer reportedly is Shadow, an affiliate of ACRONYM, which is a Democratic nonprofit founded in 2017 "to educate, inspire, register, and mobilize voters," its website says. ACRONYM's founder and CEO is Tara McGowan, a former journalist and digital producer with President Obama's 2012 presidential campaign, The Los Angeles Times reported.
Krista Davis, who worked for the tech team on Clinton's 2016 nomination campaign, co-founded Groundbase, Shadow's predecessor, with Gerard Niemira, The Los Angeles Times reported. Niemira spent eight years as an engineer at Google before moving to kiva.org, a nonprofit focused on loans for developing countries.
The Iowa Democratic and Republican parties had worked with Harvard's Defending Digital Democracy Project to develop strategies and systems to protect results and deal with any misinformation that's reported on caucus night. These questions about the creation of the app, its usability and a plan – CNN has reported – by the state of Nevada to use the app in its caucuses on Feb. 22 means it's a topic that won't soon go away.

Texto completo: Just because the Senate is about to acquit President Trump of charges Republicans believed never rose to the level of "high crimes and misdemeanors," don't think Democrats will raise the white flag of surrender. They (and their media allies) have only just begun.
Next is a campaign to defeat enough of the 23 Republican senators up for reelection and, if possible (it doesn't look possible, but this is February), keep President Trump from winning reelection.
Democrats have virtually no issues on which to run, except the promise of free stuff - from Elizabeth Warren's student loan forgiveness plan, which does nothing for those who struggled to pay off their student loans without assistance, to Bernie Sanders' free "Medicare for All."
A new Gallup poll released last week shows how difficult it will be for Democrats.
According to Gallup, 41% of Americans "are satisfied with the way things are going in the U.S." That's the highest satisfaction level in 15 years. Seventy-two % of Republicans are satisfied, a number likely to grow if the economy remains strong and there is stability in international affairs. Only 14% of Democrats are satisfied. That is likely, in part, because President Trump is racking up success after success without any cooperation from the other party. If Democrats had cooperated on at least some issues (other than the new trade agreement between the U.S., Canada and Mexico) they might have been able to legitimately claim some credit, but their opposition to all things Trump and their attempts to undo the results of the 2016 election leaves them out in the political cold.
What is most remarkable about this Gallup poll is that it was taken in the middle of the Senate impeachment trial and in the face of some of the most hostile media coverage any president has ever had to endure in modern times.
According to the conservative Media Research Center, which monitors the broadcast network's evening news programs, "...evening news coverage of the opening arguments of both sides, found ABC, CBS and NBC did not live up to the standard they demanded of Republicans. They gave Democrats double the airtime and showered their arguments with mostly praise, while expressing only criticism of the President's legal team."
The New York Times and Washington Post have cast aside any cloak of fairness by going anti-Trump nonstop. Their news coverage, editorials and virtually all of their columnists are constantly looking for new ways to express opposition to and hatred of the president. One advantage for readers is that it is easier to get through those papers because they have become predictable and tiresome.
Democrats may feel good about this as they keep company with their media fellow travelers, but President Trump is newly empowered to take his case for four more years of prosperity and relative peace to the public. Every Democrat running for president would raise taxes, giving more money to Washington, which cannot constrain its spending lust under either party. As taxes rise, so would unemployment because many businesses would no longer be able to afford workers they hired during the economic boom.
Look for more investigations - perhaps additional allegations and articles of impeachment - and more "leaks" from former Trump staffers between now and the election. The only way to stop this is for Republicans to regain a House majority and maintain their majority in the Senate.
Barring an unforeseeable disaster (always a possibility), Trump is positioned to win reelection, perhaps in a landslide, which will send the left and most of the media into another deep depression.

Hall of Fame Packers safety Wood dies at 83

Texto completo: Willie Wood was a fiercely athletic safety for the Green Bay Packers whose interception in Super Bowl I remains a cherished highlight for the organization.
Wood died Monday at an assisted living facility in his hometown of Washington, D.C., the Packers announced. He was 83.
Wood had been suffering from advanced dementia for years.
"The Green Bay Packers Family lost a legend today with the passing of Willie Wood," Packers President/CEO Mark Murphy said. "Willie's success story, rising from an undrafted rookie free agent to the Pro Football Hall of Fame, is an inspiration to generations of football fans. While his health challenges kept him from returning to Lambeau Field in recent years, his alumni weekend visits were cherished by both Willie and our fans. We extend our deepest condolences to Willie's family and friends."
The dynamic Wood was regarded as one of the best defensive backs in NFL history, a player whose vicious hits and plentiful interceptions dominated an entire decade in the 1960s. He played 12 seasons from 1960-71 — all with the Packers — and ranks second in franchise history with 48 career interceptions (trailing only Bobby Dillon's 52). Wood is the Packers' career leader in punt-return yardage with 1,391.
Wood was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1989.
"The game has lost a true legend with the passing of Willie Wood," Hall of Fame President & CEO David Baker said. "He had an unbelievable football career which helped transform Green Bay, Wisconsin into Titletown U.S.A. Willie was a rare player who always fought to be a great teammate and achieve success. He entered the league as an undrafted free agent and became one of the greatest to ever play the game. The Hall of Fame will forever keep his legacy alive to serve as inspiration to future generations."
Wood's streak of 166 consecutive games played ranks fourth behind quarterback Brett Favre (255), offensive lineman Forrest Gregg (167) and long snapper Rob Davis (167), a testament to the durability and attitude Wood hoped would define his game.
"Determination probably was my trademark," Wood said. "I was talented but so were a lot of people. I'd like people to tell you I was the toughest guy they ever played against."
Wood, who began his career as a quarterback, followed a circuitous route to Green Bay. A year of junior college in California gave way to a three-year career at Southern California with modest numbers and little national buzz. Wood went undrafted as an undersized black quarterback and relied instead on Bill Butler, his coach at the Washington, D.C., Boys Club, to write letters to pro teams campaigning on his behalf.
"Mr. Lombardi, if you could see this kid unshackled you would really agree with me," Butler said in a letter to coach Vince Lombardi in December of 1959. "If you hadn't contemplated giving him a chance, just try him one time and I'll guarantee you'll be glad you did."
Wood switched to defense and went through training camp with the Packers in 1960. He made the team as a rookie free agent and contributed immediately as a punt returner on special teams.
One year later, however, the legend of Wood was born. He replaced injured starter Jess Whittenton at safety late in the 1961 season and entrenched himself as one of the premier defensive backs in the league.
Wood made the Pro Bowl eight times in the next 11 seasons and led the Packers in interceptions five times. He earned AP All-Pro honors six times and was a unanimous selection in 1965 and 1966.
Wood retired after the 1971 season and took a job as an assistant coach for the San Diego Chargers. He went on to become the first black head coach in professional football by taking over the Philadelphia Bell of the World Football League in 1975. Five years later he became the first black head coach of the Canadian Football League as well.
"The thing is, my dad never wanted to leave football," Andre Wood, a son of Willie's, told The New York Times in an article published in 2016. "He needed a stable way to make a living. But I know he would have stayed in the NFL coaching track had he been asked to. But he wasn't."
Perhaps his finest moment came in Super Bowl I when the Packers played the Kansas City Chiefs. Wood undercut an ugly throw by Chiefs quarterback Len Dawson for an easy interception that, after a 50-yard return, set up a touchdown in what finished as a blowout win for the Packers.
"My dad was so proud of his Super Bowl moment, but I used to tease him about being tackled from behind on the play," Willie Wood Jr. told the Times.
"And his response would be, 'Yes, but I was there.'"
Wood, however, had no recollection of that play and hardly remembered his playing career at all. As detailed by the Times, the aging Wood spent the last decade in an assisted living facility in Washington. While he originally entered for chronic pain in his neck, hip and knee, Wood eventually developed dementia that sapped his memory and limited his cognitive functions.
He sometimes went days without speaking, according to the article.
"It's difficult to not be able to talk to him," Willie Wood Jr. told the Times. "He was a great father. As good an athlete as he was, he was 10 times that as a father."
Wood often wore a Packers hat during his time at the assisted living facility, even though he could not describe the exact connection between himself and the organization. But Wood knew he loved football, and when a reporter from the Times asked if he would play the sport again if given the chance, Wood's answer was simple.
"Without waiting even a beat," the article said, "Wood firmly nodded."
"You liked it that much?"
"He nodded again."
Wood is survived by his two sons and a daughter. Funeral arrangements are pending.

The world of mezcal evolves and grows

Texto completo: From the consumer's view, the world of mezcal in 2020 is radically different from that of 10 years ago. Del Maguey, which 25 years ago pioneered the discovery and marketing in the United States of small-production, geographically specific bottles, is still going strong, though its visionary founder, Ron Cooper, sold a controlling interest in the brand to the beverage giant Pernod Ricard in 2017.
Rather than packaging his discoveries as a luxury brand or with celebrity tie-ins in the fashion of tequila, mezcal's agave cousin, Cooper emphasized the cultural significance of mezcal, highlighting its ability - through traditional, laborious methods of production - to transmit the character of a place and a people.
But where 10 years ago, Del Maguey alone seemed to be shining a light on the enormous potential and complexity of mezcal, now more than a few entrepreneurs, no doubt inspired by Cooper's example, have entered the artisanal mezcal business.
While "artisanal" has become a marketing buzzword, it seems to mean something more with mezcal. Entrepreneurs with dollar signs in their eyes have gotten into the act, no surprise, but the best and most interesting bottles are still the most rustic and distinctive, rather than the most polished.
Nowadays, dozens of small-production bottles are available, each highlighting the styles of small mezcaleros, or mezcal makers, local production techniques and the various sorts of agaves that are permitted to be used in mezcal production.
Unlike tequila, which can be produced only from the blue agave in the state of Jalisco and a few surrounding areas, mezcal can legally be made in 10 Mexican states with any sort of agave.
Practically speaking, though, most mezcal comes from Oaxaca, and most of the time it's made from the espadín agave. Yet it's not rare to find mezcals made of other sorts of agaves with names like barril, jabalí, cuishe, tepeztate and tobalá.
To get a sense of the evolved world of mezcal today, the spirits panel recently tasted 20 bottles. For the tasting, Florence Fabricant of The New York Times and I were joined by two drinks writers and historians, David Wondrich and Robert Simonson.
Mezcal, like tequila, often comes with an age statement: joven, or young; reposado, which is aged in oak for up to a year, and añejo, which is aged one to three years. I love the purity of agave spirits undistorted by oak, so for this tasting we stuck to joven.
As usual, we bought all the bottles retail, and we capped the selections at $100 a bottle, which ruled out quite a few. Even without the most expensive choices, we all marveled at the high level of quality in the tasting. We were floored by the wide variety of flavors, complex and strange in the best possible way.
In the past I had come to think of smokiness as the defining feature of mezcal. In this tasting, smokiness, which comes from roasting the agaves in rock-lined pits before fermentation, was just one of many components.
We found aromas and flavors of herbs, vegetables, jalapeños, flowers and a lot more, often in combinations that seemed to vary widely from bottle to bottle.
What accounts for such variety? Partly, it's a reflection of the diversity of raw materials. Agaves take a long time to grow, and can vary in age. Some are harvested after five years, others after many more.
It's also a function of production techniques - copper pot stills are most common, for example, but some mezcaleros still use clay stills.
Local traditions differ as well. Sometimes mezcals are redistilled with grains or nuts to add flavor.
It's often said by mezcal enthusiasts that the spirit needs to be at least 45% alcohol to show its true character. Perhaps that's true. Seven bottles in our tasting had alcohol levels under 45%, and only two of those made our top 10.
Our top bottle was the Rezpiral Abel Martínez Series Four, named after the mezcalero who produced it. It was briny, deep and complex with a pronounced saline quality.
No. 2 was the subtle, complex, lightly smoky Agave de Cortés Espadín, the sort of spirit in which you seem to taste something different with every sip. By contrast, the No. 3 Sombra was rich, deep and assertive, though not as complex. At $35, it was also our best value.
I recognize that many of these mezcals may be difficult to find. The good news is that even if you cannot find the precise bottles that we tasted, many of these brands offer a variety of different bottlings, made by other mezcaleros in different villages using their own techniques and sometimes other sorts of agaves.
They are all worth trying. No doubt, you will find favorites that we did not taste. With mezcal circa 2020, discovery is part of the thrill.

Texto completo: MIDDLETOWN – Australia is on the other side of the world, but the wildfires that have ravaged the country's southeastern coast hit close to home for Finley Elias.
The fourth-grader at Lincroft Elementary School has been there to visit her grandmother and two uncles, both of whom are Australian firefighters, so she decided to take action.
"I saw a bunch of stories and videos about it, and I felt sad about it," Finley said of the fires. "I wanted to do something."
She drew up an eye-catching logo to put on T-shirts, hooded sweatshirts and tote bags with the hope of raising money to help injured and suddenly homeless koalas.
"We thought raising a couple of hundred dollars would be really cool," her father, Scott Elias, said.
The final number: $17,200, all of which will be donated to Port Macquarie Koala Hospital in New South Wales. It happened over the course of just three weeks. Finley's initiative really struck a chord.
"When she came to me with the idea, my heart wanted to burst with pride," said mom Katy Elias, who hails from Australia. "We've met koalas and the native animals, so to see the destruction and for Finley to step up as a little kid, we're all really proud."
The 10-year-old's logo design features the word "Love" with a koala hugging a tree as the "L." More than a thousand items sold thanks to fervent participation by three schools: Lincroft Elementary, Bayshore Middle, where her sister Briella attends, and Monroe Township Middle, where Katy Elias teaches physical education. Diane Brustowicz and Monroe-based B.E. Unique Design handled the custom screen printing and embroidery.
"Finley got on the announcements every morning and shared a little bit about the country and the culture," Lincroft Elementary School Principal Dan Imbimbo said. "She came up with a fantastic design, and it really caught on. The kids are excited to support one another."
Imbimbo said he's had "quite a few students" raise large sums for charities over the past few years.
"Finley's story is unique because she raised so much money, but we have a culture of students here who are really passionate about helping their community," he said. "Kids come into my office at least once a week to pitch an idea. It's been an eye-opening experience and a real blessing to see these kids do this."
The $17,000 will convert to approximately $25,000 in Australian dollars.
"It's helping the hospital fix the koalas and buy stuff for them to help them have a happy life," Finley said. "They live in trees. A lot of the trees are burning. They're not really fast, so it's hard for them to run away if their habitat burns."
It's estimated that tens of thousands of koalas have perished. The New York Times reported that "at least a quarter of the population" may have been lost in New South Wales, which is Australia's most populous state. Countless more face dehydration or starvation due to the vast habitat destruction.
Katy Elias said the Port Macquarie Koala Hospital, which typically treats a dozen or so koalas at any one time, is packed with more than 60 right now. Finley has visited the hospital in the past and interacted with its friendly inhabitants.
"They're these really cute, fluffy animals and they love to snuggle and cuddle," Finley said.
"They treat you as a tree," Katy Elias said. "They have the softest, thickest fur. Your fingers can sink right into them."
Beyond addressing the triage situation, the Elias family said the hospital is involved in creating "water stations" to help dehydrated koalas survive their displacement. That's another potential use of their donation.
"I'm very thankful and grateful for the amount we've raised," Finley said. "It feels good to do really good things for the koalas."

Texto completo: Willie Wood was a fiercely athletic safety for the Green Bay Packers whose interception in Super Bowl I remains a cherished highlight for the organization.
Wood died Monday at an assisted living facility in his hometown of Washington, D.C., the Packers announced. He was 83.
Wood had been suffering from advanced dementia for years.
"The Green Bay Packers Family lost a legend today with the passing of Willie Wood," Packers President/CEO Mark Murphy said. "Willie's success story, rising from an undrafted rookie free agent to the Pro Football Hall of Fame, is an inspiration to generations of football fans. While his health challenges kept him from returning to Lambeau Field in recent years, his alumni weekend visits were cherished by both Willie and our fans. We extend our deepest condolences to Willie's family and friends."
The dynamic Wood was regarded as one of the best defensive backs in NFL history, a player whose vicious hits and plentiful interceptions dominated an entire decade in the 1960s. He played 12 seasons from 1960-71 — all with the Packers — and ranks second in franchise history with 48 career interceptions (trailing only Bobby Dillon's 52). Wood is the Packers' career leader in punt-return yardage with 1,391.
Wood was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1989.
"The game has lost a true legend with the passing of Willie Wood," Hall of Fame President & CEO David Baker said. "He had an unbelievable football career which helped transform Green Bay, Wisconsin into Titletown U.S.A. Willie was a rare player who always fought to be a great teammate and achieve success. He entered the league as an undrafted free agent and became one of the greatest to ever play the game. The Hall of Fame will forever keep his legacy alive to serve as inspiration to future generations."
Wood's streak of 166 consecutive games played ranks fourth behind quarterback Brett Favre (255), offensive lineman Forrest Gregg (167) and long snapper Rob Davis (167), a testament to the durability and attitude Wood hoped would define his game.
"Determination probably was my trademark," Wood said. "I was talented but so were a lot of people. I'd like people to tell you I was the toughest guy they ever played against."
Wood, who began his career as a quarterback, followed a circuitous route to Green Bay. A year of junior college in California gave way to a three-year career at Southern California with modest numbers and little national buzz. Wood went undrafted as an undersized black quarterback and relied instead on Bill Butler, his coach at the Washington, D.C., Boys Club, to write letters to pro teams campaigning on his behalf.
"Mr. Lombardi, if you could see this kid unshackled you would really agree with me," Butler said in a letter to coach Vince Lombardi in December of 1959. "If you hadn't contemplated giving him a chance, just try him one time and I'll guarantee you'll be glad you did."
Wood switched to defense and went through training camp with the Packers in 1960. He made the team as a rookie free agent and contributed immediately as a punt returner on special teams.
One year later, however, the legend of Wood was born. He replaced injured starter Jess Whittenton at safety late in the 1961 season and entrenched himself as one of the premier defensive backs in the league.
Wood made the Pro Bowl eight times in the next 11 seasons and led the Packers in interceptions five times. He earned AP All-Pro honors six times and was a unanimous selection in 1965 and 1966.
Wood retired after the 1971 season and took a job as an assistant coach for the San Diego Chargers. He went on to become the first black head coach in professional football by taking over the Philadelphia Bell of the World Football League in 1975. Five years later he became the first black head coach of the Canadian Football League as well.
"The thing is, my dad never wanted to leave football," Andre Wood, a son of Willie's, told The New York Times in an article published in 2016. "He needed a stable way to make a living. But I know he would have stayed in the NFL coaching track had he been asked to. But he wasn't."
Perhaps his finest moment came in Super Bowl I when the Packers played the Kansas City Chiefs. Wood undercut an ugly throw by Chiefs quarterback Len Dawson for an easy interception that, after a 50-yard return, set up a touchdown in what finished as a blowout win for the Packers.
"My dad was so proud of his Super Bowl moment, but I used to tease him about being tackled from behind on the play," Willie Wood Jr. told the Times.
"And his response would be, 'Yes, but I was there.'"
Wood, however, had no recollection of that play and hardly remembered his playing career at all. As detailed by the Times, the aging Wood spent the last decade in an assisted living facility in Washington. While he originally entered for chronic pain in his neck, hip and knee, Wood eventually developed dementia that sapped his memory and limited his cognitive functions.
He sometimes went days without speaking, according to the article.
"It's difficult to not be able to talk to him," Willie Wood Jr. told the Times. "He was a great father. As good an athlete as he was, he was 10 times that as a father."
Wood often wore a Packers hat during his time at the assisted living facility, even though he could not describe the exact connection between himself and the organization. But Wood knew he loved football, and when a reporter from the Times asked if he would play the sport again if given the chance, Wood's answer was simple.
"Without waiting even a beat," the article said, "Wood firmly nodded."
"You liked it that much?"
"He nodded again."
Wood is survived by his two sons and a daughter. Funeral arrangements are pending.

Buttigieg leads in partial results

Texto completo: Pete Buttigieg amassed an early lead in the Iowa caucuses as results finally began filtering in from the Iowa Democratic Party late Tuesday afternoon — 21 hours after most precincts started the process. With 62% of precincts reporting, the former South Bend, Indiana mayor led the field, earning 26.9% of the state's delegate equivalents. U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont closely followed at 25.1%. U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren was in third place with 18.3%, former Vice President Joe Biden was in fourth place with 15.6%, and U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar was in fifth place at 12.6%. Results were expected to continue rolling in throughout the evening Tuesday.
Although each Democratic presidential candidate touted a measure of victory, the unprecedented delays undermined whatever momentum they might have claimed going into New Hampshire, which holds its presidential primary on Feb. 11.
Buttigieg had already begun claiming victory in Iowa late Monday, well before results were released, telling supporters at his caucus watch party that the state had "shocked the nation."
After the first batch of results was released Tuesday, he choked up addressing a crowd in New Hampshire.
"It validates the idea that we can expand a coalition not only unified around who it is we're against, but around what it is we're for," he said. "And it validates for a kid somewhere in the community, wondering if he belongs or she belongs or they belong in their own family, that if you believe in yourself and your country there's a lot backing up that belief."
Buttigieg led with the Electoral College-style delegate equivalents which are allocated to precincts based on past Democratic turnout. They're part of a system designed to encourage candidates to campaign across the state and not just in its major population centers.
But, according to the partial results released, Sanders led on the popular vote totals for both the first and second caucus alignments — new metrics that have never before been released.
"We are gratified that in the partial data released so far it's clear that in the first and second round more people voted for Bernie than any other candidate in the field," Jeff Weaver, a senior adviser to Sanders said in a statement.
Klobuchar, too, was claiming success in results tallied.
"What these results make clear is that this is a five-person race," her campaign manager, Justin Buoen, wrote in a tweet. "Some of Amy's strongest counties haven't been fully reported and the current data doesn't tell the full story. We're in a virtual tie with VP Biden and we look forward to making our case in New Hampshire."
Warren, who mounted a caucus campaign based on detailed-oriented organizing, too, said her campaign saw success.
"From the beginning, we've been building a powerful grassroots movement, and I'm so proud of what we've done. We've come out of Iowa in the top three and we are in a strong position heading into New Hampshire, Nevada, South Carolina, and Super Tuesday. Let's go!" she said in a tweet.
'I deeply apologize for this' Although Iowa's caucus results have often come late into the night, Monday's delay was unprecedented. Widespread reporting problems meant that no official results were available to campaigns, the press or the public until 4 p.m. Tuesday, leaving the field in a state of heightened uncertainty.
The delays stemmed from widespread problems with a new cellphone app designed to allow precinct leaders to report results back to the state party more quickly.
But some of those precinct leaders reported Monday morning they were unable to log into the app to report results.
Polk County Democrats Chairman Sean Bagniewski said that as early as Thursday of last week he told his precinct leaders to abandon the app if they couldn't get it to work. He instructed them to rely instead on a telephone hotline system to report results.
But as the app failed, so did the telephone hotline. Precinct leaders reported long hold times as they tried to call in their results.
The Iowa Democratic Party said at about 9:45 p.m. Monday night it was experiencing a delay in results "due to quality checks and the fact that the IDP is reporting out three data sets for the first time." New rules in place this year require the party to release the raw vote totals for the caucus' first alignment, second alignment and the final state delegate equivalents.
By 10:30 p.m., spokeswoman Mandy McClure said the party had discovered "inconsistencies in the reporting of three sets of results." She said the party was working to validate results using the paper preference cards caucusgoers filled out at their precincts.
Iowa Democratic Party Chairman Troy Price provided few answers, telling reporters on a middle-of-the-night press call that results would come at some point Tuesday. The call lasted less than two minutes.
Late Tuesday afternoon, just before the first batch of results was released, Price addressed reporters at a press conference.
"I apologize deeply for this," he said. "We hit a stumbling block on the reporting of the back end of the data, but we know this data is accurate."
Problems shift focus to Iowa's place in nominating calendar In 2012, it was shortly after 1:30 a.m. that Mitt Romney was declared the winner of the Republican caucuses, besting rival Rick Santorum by just eight votes. But two weeks later, the Republican Party of Iowa announced that a recount of results showed Santorum as the winner.
And in 2016, Iowa Democratic Party Chairwoman Andy McGuire announced at 2:30 a.m. local time on caucus night that Hillary Clinton had won by a slim margin. The Associated Press did not officially call the race until midday Tuesday. (As of 6 p.m. Tuesday, the Associated Press had not called a winner in the 2020 Democratic caucus, either.)
But in the years since the 2012 and 2016 contests, the drumbeat of calls to replace Iowa as the lead-off state in the presidential nominating calendar have grown more persistent. Concerns over diversity and inclusion have risen to the forefront this caucus cycle as a presidential field that was at one point the most diverse in history has winnowed to a mostly white pool of candidates.
The problems with Monday's results have shifted the focus back to Iowa's arcane rules and complex process.
"Our credibility is facing a test," said Iowa strategist Jeff Link, who is not affiliated with a campaign. "And it's important that we deliver accurate numbers as quickly as possible. I think it is smarter to wait and deliver credible results, because irreparably harming a candidate — which has been done in the past — is not an acceptable option."
Outside of Iowa, the critiques were sharper on Tuesday.
"I think the Iowa caucuses are dead, dead, dead," David Axelrod, a former senior adviser to President Barack Obama, said on CNN; the New York Post's front page read "Duh Moines"; and New York Times journalist Kurt Eichenwald tweeted, "Enough of Iowa."
But back home, the caucuses — and the long counting process — won praise from political leaders that often have nothing good to say about Democrats: Republicans.
"We want to make sure that the results that we do get are accurate, that we're not circling back from that," Gov. Kim Reynolds said. "So I think that they should take the time and get the numbers right and I have great confidence that we'll be able to provide accurate numbers to not only Iowans but the country."
U.S. Rep. Steve King tweeted Monday night that Democrats should take their time to ensure accurate information: "The Heart of the Heartland has saved America before. Take a deep breath and count to precision-NO matter how long it takes."

One year later, however, the legend of Wood was born. He replaced injured starter Jess Whittenton at safety late in the 1961 season and entrenched himself as one of the premier defensive backs in the league.
Wood made the Pro Bowl eight times in the next 11 seasons and led the Packers in interceptions five times. He earned AP All-Pro honors six times and was a unanimous selection in 1965 and 1966.
Wood retired after the 1971 season and took a job as an assistant coach for the San Diego Chargers. He went on to become the first black head coach in professional football by taking over the Philadelphia Bell of the World Football League in 1975. Five years later he became the first black head coach of the Canadian Football League as well.
"The thing is, my dad never wanted to leave football," Andre Wood, a son of Willie's, told The New York Times in an article published in 2016. "He needed a stable way to make a living. But I know he would have stayed in the NFL coaching track had he been asked to. But he wasn't."
Perhaps his finest moment came in Super Bowl I when the Packers played the Kansas City Chiefs. Wood undercut an ugly throw by Chiefs quarterback Len Dawson for an easy interception that, after a 50-yard return, set up a touchdown in what finished as a blowout win for the Packers.
"My dad was so proud of his Super Bowl moment, but I used to tease him about being tackled from behind on the play," Willie Wood Jr. told the Times.
"And his response would be, 'Yes, but I was there.'"
Wood, however, had no recollection of that play and hardly remembered his playing career at all. As detailed by the Times, the aging Wood spent the last decade in an assisted living facility in Washington. While he originally entered for chronic pain in his neck, hip and knee, Wood eventually developed dementia that sapped his memory and limited his cognitive functions.
He sometimes went days without speaking, according to the article.
"It's difficult to not be able to talk to him," Willie Wood Jr. told the Times. "He was a great father. As good an athlete as he was, he was 10 times that as a father."
Wood often wore a Packers hat during his time at the assisted living facility, even though he could not describe the exact connection between himself and the organization. But Wood knew he loved football, and when a reporter from the Times asked if he would play the sport again if given the chance, Wood's answer was simple.
"Without waiting even a beat," the article said, "Wood firmly nodded."
"You liked it that much?"
"He nodded again."
Wood is survived by his two sons and a daughter. Funeral arrangements are pending.

Texto completo: From the consumer's view, the world of mezcal in 2020 is radically different from that of 10 years ago. Del Maguey, which 25 years ago pioneered the discovery and marketing in the United States of small-production, geographically specific bottles, is still going strong, though its visionary founder, Ron Cooper, sold a controlling interest in the brand to the beverage giant Pernod Ricard in 2017.
Rather than packaging his discoveries as a luxury brand or with celebrity tie-ins in the fashion of tequila, mezcal's agave cousin, Cooper emphasized the cultural significance of mezcal, highlighting its ability - through traditional, laborious methods of production - to transmit the character of a place and a people.
But where 10 years ago, Del Maguey alone seemed to be shining a light on the enormous potential and complexity of mezcal, now more than a few entrepreneurs, no doubt inspired by Cooper's example, have entered the artisanal mezcal business.
While "artisanal" has become a marketing buzzword, it seems to mean something more with mezcal. Entrepreneurs with dollar signs in their eyes have gotten into the act, no surprise, but the best and most interesting bottles are still the most rustic and distinctive, rather than the most polished.
Nowadays, dozens of small-production bottles are available, each highlighting the styles of small mezcaleros, or mezcal makers, local production techniques and the various sorts of agaves that are permitted to be used in mezcal production.
Unlike tequila, which can be produced only from the blue agave in the state of Jalisco and a few surrounding areas, mezcal can legally be made in 10 Mexican states with any sort of agave.
Practically speaking, though, most mezcal comes from Oaxaca, and most of the time it's made from the espadín agave. Yet it's not rare to find mezcals made of other sorts of agaves with names like barril, jabalí, cuishe, tepeztate and tobalá.
To get a sense of the evolved world of mezcal today, the spirits panel recently tasted 20 bottles. For the tasting, Florence Fabricant of The New York Times and I were joined by two drinks writers and historians, David Wondrich and Robert Simonson.
Mezcal, like tequila, often comes with an age statement: joven, or young; reposado, which is aged in oak for up to a year, and añejo, which is aged one to three years. I love the purity of agave spirits undistorted by oak, so for this tasting we stuck to joven.
As usual, we bought all the bottles retail, and we capped the selections at $100 a bottle, which ruled out quite a few. Even without the most expensive choices, we all marveled at the high level of quality in the tasting. We were floored by the wide variety of flavors, complex and strange in the best possible way.
In the past I had come to think of smokiness as the defining feature of mezcal. In this tasting, smokiness, which comes from roasting the agaves in rock-lined pits before fermentation, was just one of many components.
We found aromas and flavors of herbs, vegetables, jalapeños, flowers and a lot more, often in combinations that seemed to vary widely from bottle to bottle.
What accounts for such variety? Partly, it's a reflection of the diversity of raw materials. Agaves take a long time to grow, and can vary in age. Some are harvested after five years, others after many more.
It's also a function of production techniques - copper pot stills are most common, for example, but some mezcaleros still use clay stills.
Local traditions differ as well. Sometimes mezcals are redistilled with grains or nuts to add flavor.
It's often said by mezcal enthusiasts that the spirit needs to be at least 45% alcohol to show its true character. Perhaps that's true. Seven bottles in our tasting had alcohol levels under 45%, and only two of those made our top 10.
Our top bottle was the Rezpiral Abel Martínez Series Four, named after the mezcalero who produced it. It was briny, deep and complex with a pronounced saline quality.
No. 2 was the subtle, complex, lightly smoky Agave de Cortés Espadín, the sort of spirit in which you seem to taste something different with every sip. By contrast, the No. 3 Sombra was rich, deep and assertive, though not as complex. At $35, it was also our best value.
I recognize that many of these mezcals may be difficult to find. The good news is that even if you cannot find the precise bottles that we tasted, many of these brands offer a variety of different bottlings, made by other mezcaleros in different villages using their own techniques and sometimes other sorts of agaves.
They are all worth trying. No doubt, you will find favorites that we did not taste. With mezcal circa 2020, discovery is part of the thrill.

Texto completo: Willie Wood was a fiercely athletic safety for the Green Bay Packers whose interception in Super Bowl I remains a cherished highlight for the organization.
Wood died Monday at an assisted living facility in his hometown of Washington, D.C., the Packers announced. He was 83.
Wood had been suffering from advanced dementia for years.
"The Green Bay Packers Family lost a legend today with the passing of Willie Wood," Packers President/CEO Mark Murphy said. "Willie's success story, rising from an undrafted rookie free agent to the Pro Football Hall of Fame, is an inspiration to generations of football fans. While his health challenges kept him from returning to Lambeau Field in recent years, his alumni weekend visits were cherished by both Willie and our fans. We extend our deepest condolences to Willie's family and friends."
The dynamic Wood was regarded as one of the best defensive backs in NFL history, a player whose vicious hits and plentiful interceptions dominated an entire decade in the 1960s. He played 12 seasons from 1960-71 — all with the Packers — and ranks second in franchise history with 48 career interceptions (trailing only Bobby Dillon's 52). Wood is the Packers' career leader in punt-return yardage with 1,391.
Wood was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1989.
"The game has lost a true legend with the passing of Willie Wood," Hall of Fame President & CEO David Baker said. "He had an unbelievable football career which helped transform Green Bay, Wisconsin into Titletown U.S.A. Willie was a rare player who always fought to be a great teammate and achieve success. He entered the league as an undrafted free agent and became one of the greatest to ever play the game. The Hall of Fame will forever keep his legacy alive to serve as inspiration to future generations."
Wood's streak of 166 consecutive games played ranks fourth behind quarterback Brett Favre (255), offensive lineman Forrest Gregg (167) and long snapper Rob Davis (167), a testament to the durability and attitude Wood hoped would define his game.
"Determination probably was my trademark," Wood said. "I was talented but so were a lot of people. I'd like people to tell you I was the toughest guy they ever played against."
Wood, who began his career as a quarterback, followed a circuitous route to Green Bay. A year of junior college in California gave way to a three-year career at Southern California with modest numbers and little national buzz. Wood went undrafted as an undersized black quarterback and relied instead on Bill Butler, his coach at the Washington, D.C., Boys Club, to write letters to pro teams campaigning on his behalf.
"Mr. Lombardi, if you could see this kid unshackled you would really agree with me," Butler said in a letter to coach Vince Lombardi in December of 1959. "If you hadn't contemplated giving him a chance, just try him one time and I'll guarantee you'll be glad you did."
Wood switched to defense and went through training camp with the Packers in 1960. He made the team as a rookie free agent and contributed immediately as a punt returner on special teams.
One year later, however, the legend of Wood was born. He replaced injured starter Jess Whittenton at safety late in the 1961 season and entrenched himself as one of the premier defensive backs in the league.
Wood made the Pro Bowl eight times in the next 11 seasons and led the Packers in interceptions five times. He earned AP All-Pro honors six times and was a unanimous selection in 1965 and 1966.
Wood retired after the 1971 season and took a job as an assistant coach for the San Diego Chargers. He went on to become the first black head coach in professional football by taking over the Philadelphia Bell of the World Football League in 1975. Five years later he became the first black head coach of the Canadian Football League as well.
"The thing is, my dad never wanted to leave football," Andre Wood, a son of Willie's, told The New York Times in an article published in 2016. "He needed a stable way to make a living. But I know he would have stayed in the NFL coaching track had he been asked to. But he wasn't."
Perhaps his finest moment came in Super Bowl I when the Packers played the Kansas City Chiefs. Wood undercut an ugly throw by Chiefs quarterback Len Dawson for an easy interception that, after a 50-yard return, set up a touchdown in what finished as a blowout win for the Packers.
"My dad was so proud of his Super Bowl moment, but I used to tease him about being tackled from behind on the play," Willie Wood Jr. told the Times.
"And his response would be, 'Yes, but I was there.'"
Wood, however, had no recollection of that play and hardly remembered his playing career at all. As detailed by the Times, the aging Wood spent the last decade in an assisted living facility in Washington. While he originally entered for chronic pain in his neck, hip and knee, Wood eventually developed dementia that sapped his memory and limited his cognitive functions.
He sometimes went days without speaking, according to the article.
"It's difficult to not be able to talk to him," Willie Wood Jr. told the Times. "He was a great father. As good an athlete as he was, he was 10 times that as a father."
Wood often wore a Packers hat during his time at the assisted living facility, even though he could not describe the exact connection between himself and the organization. But Wood knew he loved football, and when a reporter from the Times asked if he would play the sport again if given the chance, Wood's answer was simple.
"Without waiting even a beat," the article said, "Wood firmly nodded."
"You liked it that much?"
"He nodded again."
Wood is survived by his two sons and a daughter. Funeral arrangements are pending.

Texto completo: The New York Times (NYT), an ultra-left wing newspaper, which has endorsed every Democrat Presidential candidate since President Kennedy, entered the Democrat Primary fray for 2020 by endorsing not one but two Presidential candidates: Amy Klobuchar and Elizabeth Warren.
Let's set aside the fact that endorsing two candidates when voters can only vote for one candidate is akin to picking both Kansas City Chiefs and the San Francisco 49ers to win the Superbowl. The move by NYT to endorse two candidates instead of one highlights the quandary for the Democrat party: two different political philosophies going head-to-head in a party that is deeply divided. This division has no end in sight as there are several enabling factors identified below that will likely make the situation only worse.
Candidate funding: Recent Federal Election (FEC) filings show three candidates (Sanders, Warren, Buttigieg) with at least $20 million "Cash on Hand." Biden has $9 million, but he is leading most national polls. That leaves four candidates who can stay viable for a long time. Add to the list the two billionaires with plenty of financial resources and you have six candidates with plenty of runway ahead of them.
Democrat Party rules: To secure any delegates in a state primary/caucus, a candidate must meet the 15% threshold. Delegates are proportionately divided amongst the candidates who meet the 15% threshold. Let's take Iowa as an example to illustrate the downside to these rules. Here's the most recent RealClearPolitics average of polls: Biden 21%, Sanders 17%, Warren 17%, Buttigieg 16%. If the polls are accurate, here's the potential delegate count coming out of Iowa: Biden 12, Sanders 10, Warren 10, Buttigieg 9, rest of the field 0. The difference between first place and fourth place is three delegates and no one is anywhere close to a majority of 21 delegates. Many states in addition to Iowa are in an identical situation. California, with 416 delegates, has Biden at 24%, Sanders at 23% and Warren at 21%. It will take a majority of 1,886 delegates to avoid a contested convention and win the nomination outright.
Contested convention: If no candidate gets a majority of 1,886 delegates in the first ballot, the 764 superdelegates (aka establishment) are eligible to vote in subsequent ballots. Imagine the reaction from Sanders and AOC if the superdelegates end up deciding the nominee and picking someone not named Sanders. Chicago 1968 would pale in comparison to Milwaukee 2020.
Trump lies in wait: When the Democrat party finally picks a nominee, President Trump lies in wait with plenty of cash to go after that nominee. As of December, the President had $83 million and Republican party had $63 million Cash on Hand (Democrat party had $8 million). This situation will be similar to the 2012 Obama-Romney contest with the shoe on the other foot. Romney was in a weak financial position coming out of the primaries and during the summer of 2012. Team Obama obliterated Romney, never letting him rise. Expect Team Trump to do the same in 2020.
One final point: The New York Times' infinite wisdom of endorsing two candidates notwithstanding, the Democrats can only have one nominee. That leaves them with a choice of a Socialist or a "moderate." Nominate a Socialist, and the Independents go with Trump. Nominate a "moderate," and the Socialists stay home. Democrats are a house divided, and for some reason, the name McGovern and the year 1972 comes to mind.

Texto completo: Just beyond the windows of Satsuki Kanno's apartment overlooking Tokyo Bay, a behemoth from a bygone era will soon rise: a coal-burning power plant, part of a buildup of coal power that is unheard-of for an advanced economy.
It is one unintended consequence of the Fukushima nuclear disaster almost a decade ago, which forced Japan to all but close its nuclear power program. Japan now plans to build as many as 22 new coal-burning power plants - one of the dirtiest sources of electricity - at 17 different sites in the next five years, just at a time when the world needs to slash carbon dioxide emissions to fight global warming.
"Why coal, why now?" said Kanno, a homemaker in Yokosuka, the site for two of the coal-burning units that will be built just several hundred feet from her home. "It's the worst possible thing they could build."
Together the 22 power plants would emit almost as much carbon dioxide annually as all the passenger cars sold each year in the United States. The construction stands in contrast with Japan's effort to portray this summer's Olympic Games in Tokyo as one of the greenest ever.
The Yokosuka project has prompted unusual pushback in Japan, where environmental groups more typically focus their objections on nuclear power. But some local residents are suing the government over its approval of the new coal-burning plant in what supporters hope will jump-start opposition to coal in Japan.
The Japanese government, the plaintiffs say, rubber-stamped the project without a proper environmental assessment. The complaint is noteworthy because it argues that the plant will not only degrade local air quality, but will also endanger communities by contributing to climate change.
Carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere is the major driver of global warming, because it traps the sun's heat. Coal burning is one of the biggest single sources of carbon dioxide emissions.
Japan is already experiencing severe effects from climate change. Scientists have said that a heat wave in 2018 that killed more than 1,000 people could not have happened without climate change. Because of heat concerns, the International Olympic Committee was compelled to move the Tokyo Olympics' marathon events to a cooler city almost 700 miles north.
Japan's policy sets it apart from other developed economies. Britain, the birthplace of the industrial revolution, is set to phase out coal power by 2025, and France has said it will shut down its coal power plants even earlier, by 2022. In the U.S., utilities are rapidly retiring coal power and no new plants are actively under development.
But Japan relies on coal for more than a third of its power generation needs. And while older coal plants will start retiring, eventually reducing overall coal dependency, the country still expects to meet more than a quarter of its electricity needs from coal in 2030.

Texto completo: A Lego competition series debuts on Fox. And "Expedition Unknown" returns for another season on Discovery Channel.
What's on TV
LEGO MASTERS 9 p.m. on Fox. Pop quiz: What's the plural of Lego? That question is addressed at the start of this competition series, which has aired in different forms overseas but is now coming to United States audiences. Will Arnett (known in certain circles as the voice of Lego Batman) hosts the United States version of the show, alongside a pair of Lego designers. The competition pits teams from around the country against one another in a variety of brick-building challenges. The contestants' first assignment: to create a model theme park. Their time limit? 15 hours. The prize for winning the competition at large is $ 100,000 -- though surely any contestants who make it through without stepping on a brick can be considered successful.
MONEYBALL (2011) 6:47 p.m. on Starz. The New York Times's co-chief film critic Manohla Dargis recently wrote an article arguing that Brad Pitt has been undervalued as a performer. Pitt was nominated for an acting Oscar this year, but that's a relatively rare thing -- the last time he was up for one was toward the beginning of the 2010s, when he was recognized for his performance in this baseball drama. In it, Pitt plays Billy Beane, the Oakland Athletics manager whose innovative methods helped the A's compete against teams with far higher budgets in the early 2000s.
FENCES (2016) 10 p.m. on BET. Baseball also plays a role in "Fences," August Wilson's Pulitzer Prize-winning play about love and contention in a 1950s Pittsburgh household. This film adaptation stars Denzel Washington as the protagonist, Troy Maxson, a former Negro Leagues player who might have been a Major League star if he'd been born in a different decade. The plot hinges on Troy's struggles to accept the athletic potential of his teenage son, Cory (Jovan Adepo), and the sometimes strained relationship between Troy and his wife, Rose (Viola Davis). "If the sound were to suddenly fail -- or if the dialogue were dubbed into Martian -- the impact of the performances would still be palpable," A.O. Scott wrote in his review for The Times.
EXPEDITION UNKNOWN 8 p.m. on Discovery Channel. Josh Gates has explored many exciting places as the host of this travel series: He's visited an archaeological dig site in Egypt, a sinkhole in Siberia and Australia's Shipwreck Coast in his mission to investigate historical mysteries. In the first episode of the new season, debuting Wednesday, he'll be in Normandy, where he follows historians studying D-Day and tours a newly discovered World War II bunker. Don't expect him to stay there long, though: By the end of the season, he'll be in the Bermuda Triangle.
What's Streaming
McMILLIONS Stream on HBO platforms. The life and death of a scam in six parts, this new documentary series revisits an elaborate real-life scheme that involved a former police officer defrauding McDonald's out of $ 24 million. The first episode aired on HBO on Monday; it's available to stream for those who want to catch up before next week's episode.

LIGHTNING ROD CNN WHITE HOUSE CHIEF CORRESPONDENT JIM ACOSTA VISITS POINT PARK

Texto completo: When CNN chief White House correspondent Jim Acosta speaks at Point Park University's Pittsburgh Playhouse, Downtown, on Thursday, there will be scant middle ground.
"People either love or hate Acosta, but there's no doubt that he has been an outspoken representative for the public's interest in knowing what's going on in the White House and in Washington," said Andrew Conte, director of Point Park's Center for Media Innovation.
"He served this role in the Obama White House, and he's doing it again now with the Trump administration. The biggest difference is that President Trump has taken a much more vocal and aggressive stance against the media, and against CNN and Jim Acosta personally."
Acosta's appearance for the university's Media Innovators Speakers Series "is an opportunity for me to relay to the audience, 'This is what it's like, being a White House correspondent during a Donald Trump presidency,'" he said in a recent phone interview.
The CNN reporter was the early poster boy for the president's rage against the media during the 2016 campaign. He's been called a "rude, terrible" person and had his press credentials revoked - CNN filed suit, and they were eventually restored - and in one memorable incident, he was accused of striking a White House intern after a doctored video went viral.
Acosta's career path to CNN included television and radio before he landed at CBS News. His book, "The Enemy of the People: A Dangerous Time to Tell the Truth in America," outlines any number of big changes to his job of covering the White House.
"We've had some pretty difficult challenges, like I've never seen before as a journalist," he said. Homemade pipe bombs were sent to CNN offices as well as to prominent Democratic figures in 2018 by Cesar Sayoc, who is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence.
During that period, Acosta said, he received "some nine or 10 death threats [directed] at me; one of them was posted on Twitter saying, 'You're the enemy of America, you're next,' with a picture of a decapitated goat's head.
"So I think what the administration and the president have failed to understand, and appreciate, is that words matter. What they say matters."
On a less dramatic scale, the media continues to navigate a new, more hostile climate. CNN's Manu Raju was called a "liberal hack" when he approached Arizona Republican Sen. Martha McSally for a quote earlier this month, and NPR's Michele Kelemen was told she could not be part of the press team traveling with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.
The latter also famously upbraided NPR's Mary Louise Kelly after an interview and demanded she prove she could identify Ukraine on an unmarked map. Kelly, in a New York Times op-ed piece, responded, "For the record, I did. That's not the point."
In Acosta's opinion, attacks on the media have led to even more careful reporting. Many journalists, he said, "are so trapped in what other people want to be a box .. I think we have to err on the side of the truth, even if it is a painful truth."
But Acosta said he has heard encouragement from all sides, including some from the conservative media: "They say, 'Keep doing what you're doing.' So what choice do we have?"
Conte said the speakers series has drawn three kinds of patrons: young people/students (who receive discounted tickets), professionals and the general public. He said he expects this week's appearance by Acosta to attract more people from the public. As part of the series' mission to the public, it can provide "opportunities to understand the role of a free press and to hear directly from newsmakers."
When speaking at institutions of higher learning, Acosta said, his message has changed. "I used to say to college students who wanted to come into the business, 'Don't do it. You're going to miss your weekends and your holidays and your mother's birthday. You won't be home for Christmas. Your parents won't be very happy, your family won't be very happy.
"But now I tell young journalists to stay in the business and keep at it. Because we need reinforcements."
The event begins at 7 p.m. Tickets: $40-$65; www.pittsburghplayhouse.com or 412-392-8000.

WHY IOWA?

Texto completo: At some point we may find out who won the Iowa caucuses.
And then we will see if this information is absorbed and whether it matters.
The only real function of the Iowa caucuses is to create momentum for a candidate - propelling a dark horse from obscurity or cementing the lead of a favored front-runner. In that the chaos and ineptitude there raises the question of why Iowa should be the first contest, and why it should have such influence in the presidential nomination process, we may also be permitted to ask the larger question: Is the creation of momentum a particularly useful function?
Moreover, presumably momentum could come from any state that is first - maybe a state that is more a microcosm of the nation. Why should it not be Pennsylvania or Ohio?
Why should it not be a different state every four years?
If that state were California or New York, or if we began the process with Super Tuesday or a national primary, the underdog and the outsider would never have a shot.
But then again, the penchant for someone or something new can turn into a freakish obsession with novelty. And is that good for democracy?
The incompetence of the Democratic Party in Iowa is obviously incompetence on an epic level. How could it be this difficult to count? Iowa counted voters before there were apps, after all.
But the party's incompetence is also undemocratic because it undermines the work of so many volunteer campaigners, not to mention the candidates themselves and not to mention the results themselves.
The results, if they are ever fully known and fully accepted as legitimate, have been muted and trivialized. The decisions of the caucusgoers - people who set a large block of time aside on a work night - have been diminished, if not negated. If Bernie Sanders or Pete Buttigieg accomplished something Monday night, it has been muddied, if not washed away. If the national party got a wake-up call on Joe Biden, it may well not be heard.
And we may have another compromised and contested election in America.
Not so long ago, New Hampshire was first in the nation in picking presidents. No one cared about Iowa. We will likely go back to that model now. There is nothing magical about New Hampshire, either. But at least we all know what a primary is and that state knows how to run one.
There is also nothing wrong with a slow process or a long count. Democracy, like life, is inherently messy. And, like life, it tends to sort itself out eventually.
But this was something else: This was more like dropping Excalibur than a football. This was failure in a solemn and sacred responsibility. It should cause us to question both the primacy of Iowa and the basic competence of the Democratic Party.

Texto completo: Some readers argue that the tallying delays should lead to a rethinking of the Iowa caucuses, while others wonder, What's the rush?
To the Editor:
Re "Tensions in Iowa Over Long Delays in Caucus Tallies" (front page, Feb. 4):
The Iowa Democratic Party tried something new Monday night. Instead of simply giving the world one winner, the party wanted all of us to know who was the caucusgoers' first pick, their second pick and, ultimately, the candidate who received the most delegates.
That process failed. Was it frustrating? Yes. Was it exhausting? Yes. Was it expensive? Yes. Are people angry? Of course. The new process failed. Is it the end of the world? Not at all.
It was human error. And after the years of lies from President Trump, admitting honest human mistakes is almost a breath of fresh air. No one is trying to cover it up, or make up some lie or give some pathetic line.
Take a deep breath and be reminded of the words of the humorist Will Rogers: "I am not a member of any organized political party. I am a Democrat."
Lee Lumbley
Red Oak, Tex.
To the Editor:
As someone who has developed large-scale applications such as were designed for Iowa's caucuses, I'd like to call all of the developers into a room, slap them on the head and ask, "What were you thinking?" Rule No. 1 of designing systems: "Presume It Will Go Wrong. Plan Accordingly."
The Russians did not have to hack our systems. We did it ourselves.
Stevan Alburty
Liberty Lake, Wash.
To the Editor:
Over the years, we have been repeatedly told that Iowa voters deserve their privileged position as first in the nation because of how seriously they take the voting process. If that were ever true, the debacle of this year's Iowa caucuses should put an end to what is fundamentally an undemocratic process that disenfranchises those who cannot devote several hours to the process of voting.
The caucus method suits a pied piper candidate like Senator Bernie Sanders who can promise free tuition, cancellation of student debt and universal health care to an army of young people who can devote an evening to a party-like event. The senator's campaign complicated an already messy process by demanding changes to the reporting of voting tallies after his defeat in 2016.
Finally, with the choice of a poorly tested application, the local Democratic Party lost any claim to be first to vet the candidates.
Brian Gorman
Santa Barbara, Calif.
To the Editor:
The Iowa caucuses are a blessing. It was so great to be in a room of 800 Democrats working for a brighter future. All Democrats should have that experience. It is worth the wait in hearing the results. The rest of the country needs to just chill out.
Keri Hornbuckle
Iowa City
To the Editor:
The privileged status of Iowa's caucuses leading off the presidential campaign season has long been criticized as unrepresentative of the Democratic electorate: too rural, too white, too old. But they are also inherently discriminatory against working parents, the elderly, the poor, the disabled and others who may be unable to spend a winter night at a caucus. And now we have the counting fiasco.
The Democratic Party should require primaries and do away with caucuses in Iowa and elsewhere.
Steve Nelson
Washington, Mass.
To the Editor:
People were outraged about the fact that the media could not report the outcome of the Iowa caucuses Monday night. The campaigns, too, were angry that their candidates were denied the ability to make prime-time speeches in which they could spin their outcomes in a way that would portray victories of some kind.
But the caucuses were choosing delegates to a convention that is scheduled for mid-July. Why does it matter that the results will be known only on Tuesday rather than Monday night? Why is it better to be able to report, breathlessly, on one-precinct-at-a-time results as they dribble in, and to speculate on what they imply for the state as a whole, than to have the final statewide outcomes all at the same time, with the same details available?

Texto completo: Mr. Morales, the former president of Bolivia, is now living in Argentina and facing an arrest warrant in his homeland. His bid for the Senate could further roil a bitterly divided nation.
CARACAS, Venezuela -- Evo Morales, the former Bolivian president who fled his country in November amid violent protests over his bid to stay in power, will attempt to run for the Senate in the country's upcoming elections.
The announcement is only the most recent sign that Mr. Morales intends to play an active role in Bolivian politics, despite living in exile in Argentina and facing an arrest warrant issued by Bolivia's interim government.
Mr. Morales' plans were made public on Monday when his party registered his candidacy with the country's electoral tribunal. Mr. Morales congratulated his party on Twitter for choosing "the best men and women for the next legislature."
His plan to run is likely to heighten tensions ahead of Bolivia's election on May 3, in which the country will choose its next president.
Three months after Mr. Morales' abrupt exit from office, Bolivia remains bitterly divided between his supporters, many of them from the country's Indigenous majority, and the long-ruling elite of European descent.
Mr. Morales, Bolivia's first Indigenous president, was in power for 14 years, but fled after his attempt to win a fourth term resulted in a disputed election and violent protests.
When Jeanine Añez stepped in as interim president, she first said that she would lead as a caretaker until a new election could be held -- and that she would not run for president. But she has since begun an aggressive effort to reverse many of the leftist policies of Mr. Morales. She has sought closer ties to the United States and sent home Venezuelan diplomats and Cuban doctors.
Ms. Añez, a conservative Catholic, has also reinserted the church into political life, after years in which Mr. Morales put Indigenous culture front and center.
In late January she announced she would run for president. The election is shaping into a battle between the competing visions of Mr. Morales and Ms. Añez for the country's political identity.
Mr. Morales is barred from running for the presidency in this election. And it is unclear if he will actually be able to run for the Senate. He could be disqualified on a technicality.
To run, "he needs to demonstrate continued residency in Bolivia for at least two years," said Santiago Anria, a professor of Latin American politics at Dickinson College. "And over the past few months he's been in Mexico and Argentina."
Ms. Añez has said in the past that Mr. Morales can return to his country "whenever he wants." But her government accuses him of sedition and terrorism, meaning he could be arrested upon arrival.
On Monday, Mr. Morales' political party, Movement Toward Socialism, nominated an economist and former finance minister, Luis Arce, as its presidential candidate.
Seven others also have registered to run for president. They include a former president, Carlos Mesa, a centrist, and several more conservative candidates, like Luis Fernando Camacho, a leader of the protests against Mr. Morales last year, and Chi Hyun-chung, a Korean-born conservative evangelical pastor.
A poll by the firm Mercados y Muestras, released in January, showed that Mr. Arce was supported by 26 percent of voters, more than any other candidate, but not by enough to win outright in a first round.
To win in the first round on May 3, presidential candidates will need either a majority or 40 percent of the vote and a 10 percent lead over the second-place candidate.

Texto completo: At lunch with TV anchors before the State of the Union, the president was jovial about Iowa's voting problems and said John Bolton 'turned on me.'
President Trump told a group of television news anchors at the White House on Tuesday that he would participate in this year's general election debates, despite his misgivings about the commission that oversees them, according to two people with knowledge of his comments.
Mr. Trump also said he hoped that Rush Limbaugh, the right-wing talk radio star who this week announced a diagnosis of advanced lung cancer, would attend Tuesday's State of the Union address. The president said he was interested in awarding Mr. Limbaugh the Presidential Medal of Freedom. On Tuesday evening during his address, Mr. Trump did just that, with the first lady, Melania Trump, presenting the medal to a surprised Mr. Limbaugh in the gallery.
In a jovial mood after Iowa Democrats botched Monday's caucus vote count -- a situation that Mr. Trump happily called a "fiasco" -- the president held court for nearly two hours on Tuesday afternoon over a lunch of sole and soup in the State Dining Room. Vice President Mike Pence and Ivanka Trump also attended.
The conversation, an annual tradition for anchors, is off the record, but as in past years, multiple people described Mr. Trump's remarks after the fact. Journalists from The New York Times were not invited and did not agree to those off-the-record terms.
The White House declined to discuss the president's remarks. "I actually have ethics so I'm not going to comment on an off-the-record lunch," said Stephanie Grisham, the White House press secretary.
The president had tough words for John Bolton, his former national security adviser, complaining that Mr. Bolton wanted to be referred to as "ambassador" and saying that Mr. Bolton "turned on me" by writing a book that includes unflattering portrayals of Mr. Trump's behavior.
As for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who will stand on the dais beside Mr. Pence during the State of the Union, Mr. Trump said the two had not spoken in some time. "There's one person behind me who's going to be friendly and one who's not going to be friendly," the president said, referring to his Tuesday evening address.
With a Diet Coke at his side, Mr. Trump spoke of his regret about Mr. Limbaugh's medical diagnosis, saying that he had recently spoken with the talk-radio host and Mr. Limbaugh had offered no hint of his illness.
Asked about this fall's general election debates, Mr. Trump repeated his recent complaints that "Never Trumpers" sit on the Commission on Presidential Debates, the nonpartisan group that organizes the events. But the president said he had decided to participate, because he believed his debate performances helped him win support from voters in the 2016 campaign.
The annual anchor lunch predates Mr. Trump's administration. On Tuesday, Mr. Trump broke from precedent by declining to invite journalists from CNN, a network that he routinely accuses of bias.
Chuck Todd, the moderator of NBC's "Meet the Press," told Mr. Trump at the lunch that he was asking a question on behalf of the CNN anchor Jake Tapper, according to another person familiar with the exchange. The president responded by saying that journalists from "MSDNC" -- his recently adopted nickname for MSNBC -- were also absent, though Mr. Todd hosts a daily afternoon show for the cable network.
Mr. Trump often castigates news outlets and individual reporters in public, contributing to a hostile environment toward journalists that press freedom groups have called dangerous and encouraging to autocrats who suppress independent media. But the president was described as cordial and easygoing at Tuesday's event.

Texto completo: A woman hospitalized in the city tested negative for the illness, officials said. Results are pending on tests for two other patients.
A woman hospitalized in New York City amid concerns that she could have the new coronavirus has tested negative, city health officials said on Tuesday.
The woman, who had been at Bellevue Medical Center since Friday night, was one of three patients recently hospitalized in the city who doctors thought might have the virus, which emerged in China late last year before spreading to at least two dozen countries.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported the negative results for the woman's samples to city authorities on Tuesday, officials said. Samples from the other two patients who may have the virus have been sent to the C.D.C., and the results are pending, officials said.
"We're relieved to hear that the person in question does not have the novel coronavirus," Mayor Bill de Blasio said in a statement. "I can't say this enough: If you have the symptoms and recent travel history, please see your health provider immediately."
There has yet to be a confirmed case of the new illness in New York City or anywhere in New York State.
As of Monday, 11 people in the United States had been found to have the illness, according to the C.D.C. Of the 11, the only patient on the East Coast to have tested positive was in Massachusetts.
The new virus is believed to have originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan late last year before spreading widely. The Chinese government has reported 20,438 confirmed cases, and the death toll in China had passed 420 deaths as of Tuesday.
For now, local authorities in the United States cannot test for the virus and must send samples to the C.D.C. in Atlanta. It can take several days to get results.
New York City officials have said that the three patients whose samples were sent to the C.D.C. had all traveled recently from China; had a fever and cough or shortness of breath; and had tested negative for influenza and a number of other common illnesses.
The woman who tested negative for the new coronavirus is said to be under 40. She was visiting New York and began to feel ill about two days after arriving in the United States. An ambulance brought her from the hotel where she was staying to Bellevue, the flagship of the city's public hospital system, late on Friday.
"The response and care the patient received reflects how well the systems we have in place are working," said Dr. Oxiris Barbot, the city's health commissioner.
The two other patients whose samples were sent to the C.D.C. have been described as over 60. Both were hospitalized last weekend in Flushing, Queens.
The authorities in New York have said they are ready for the illness, and that sooner or later it is bound to arrive.
"Whatever happens internationally, it winds up at our doorstep relatively quickly," Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, said at a news conference on Sunday.
Coronaviruses have been behind other dangerous outbreaks in recent decades: SARS in 2003 and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, or MERS, which was first reported in 2012.
The new coronavirus appears to be less lethal than SARS or MERS, but it is spreading more quickly. Symptoms can include fever, cough and shortness of breath, according to the C.D.C. While the illness is mild in some patients, others have pneumonia and respiratory failure.

Texto completo: Readers discuss the grief process in the age of social media. Also: A birth control case in the Supreme Court; susceptible to a big lie.
To the Editor:
Re "No Right Way to Mourn," by Sian Beilock, the president of Barnard College (Op-Ed, Feb. 3), about criticism on social media of the different ways that people grieve:
I lost a classmate when Tess Majors, a Barnard freshman, was killed, and a hometown legend when the basketball star Kobe Bryant died.
I'm a first-year Barnard student, and I'm from Los Angeles; I didn't know how to deal with either loss because of the proximity I felt to them. Ms. Beilock's article, as well as her actions on campus since Tess died, have comforted me as I found myself feeling self-conscious about my public grieving process.
I didn't post about Tess, and I didn't post about Kobe. Was I a bad classmate? A bad Angeleno? No. Ms. Beilock's article helped me acknowledge that there was no way I could have grieved incorrectly.
Any way I grieve and mourn is the right way for me, and anything I do or not do doesn't make me less of a Barnard woman or a Los Angeles resident.
Naomi Rubin
New York
To the Editor:
As Sian Beilock points out so eloquently, the downside of social media is possible exposure to vilification by a world of strangers. Everyone just judges you.
When you're grieving, however, you're at your most fragile. Be prepared.

The Supreme Court and Birth Control
To the Editor:
Re "Court to Decide Whether Employers Must Offer Birth Control" (news article, Jan. 18):
When the Supreme Court debates the right of employers to refuse coverage of birth control for their employees, one fact cannot be overlooked: Each form of birth control holds powerful health benefits separate and distinct from preventing pregnancy.
Some are approved for these noncontraceptive indications by the Food and Drug Administration: The hormonal intrauterine device is first-line therapy for heavy menstrual bleeding, and many brands of birth control pills are approved for the treatment of acne and/or premenstrual mood disorders.
The three most common contraception methods (the pill, the hormonal IUD and the copper IUD) have powerful protective effects against uterine cancer, the most common gynecologic cancer. Long-term use of the pill halves the lifetime risk of ovarian cancer, the most lethal of gynecologic cancers.
I often start young women on the pill or a hormonal IUD to improve heavy, painful or irregular periods that otherwise would keep them home from school or work.
The health and financial burdens to women and society of unplanned pregnancy are one reason to ensure access to birth control. The health benefits that birth control provides -- independent from contraception -- are a critical second.

Why We Fall for a Big Lie
To the Editor:
Re "Why Politicians Get a License to Lie," by Charlie Warzel (Opinion, Jan. 8):
There is only one fundamental license to lie: when there's a credulous public. You cannot be insulted (lied to) without your permission. We have glommed super-high-tech glitz and slickness onto a 24/7 media blitz of entertainment and salesmanship that relies almost exclusively on the mass of its readers suspending disbelief. This is the essence of 21st-century "culture" and thus of its politics.
I have never seen one thing on Facebook. I have never seen Twitter or any social media vehicle other than texting. The majority of all those who have ever lived have never done so.
I read The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Los Angeles Times, The Atlantic, The New Yorker and The Economist, among other traditional print news organizations. And from those I get two things: serious, long-trusted sources of legitimate news and a verification or not of that news (they all, too, make mistakes sometimes).
We the people grant the license to lie by submitting ourselves to the simple-minded pleasure of the commercial/entertainment con.
Would someone then retort that well, that's just the world we live in? I'm sure. And my response would be that we used to live in a world where almost no one was educated or could read, then one where a good number were educated; and we used to live in an accepted, entrenched system of legalized slavery.
An old Chinese saying is: the beginning of wisdom is to call things by the right names. I submit that we should always start at the beginning.

Texto completo: In "The Other Latif," the reporter Latif Nasser covers the legal plight of Detainee 244, Abdul Latif Nasser.
"Radiolab," the popular W.N.Y.C. audio program, has long explored big philosophical questions about the world through investigations about everything from eels to the legal foundation for the "war on terror." But for its first serialized story, "The Other Latif," the show will take listeners to the barbed-wire gates of the prison at Guantánamo Bay to explore legal and ethical quandaries about a detainee.
It's a place that has been described as "the legal equivalent of outer space," the show's host, Latif Nasser, said in an interview.
The idea and the title for the show grew from a tweet that Nasser, the director of research at "Radiolab," saw in early 2017. At first glance, he thought it mentioned his name -- he once went by Abdul Latif Nasser (trading one of his middle names for his first name).
The tweet was posted by a human rights law firm, Reprieve. It linked to a letter it had sent to President Barack Obama, requesting help for Abdul Latif Nasser before Obama left office. Abdul Latif Nasser, who had been at the prison since 2002, was still being held, even though a government review board had recommended his release in July 2016. This was all, his lawyers said, because of "nothing more than bureaucratic delay."
Nasser explores who the prisoner is and why he's being held, working with the executive producer Suzie Lechtenberg for the series's six episodes. But without the ability to interview his subject, Nasser had to weigh the government's narrative with the lawyers' version of events.
According to a leaked government document, the detainee has been accused of being one of Osama bin Laden's top military advisers and helping him escape the battle of Tora Bora. His lawyers, however, maintain that he was an aid worker who was in the wrong place at the wrong time. He has not been charged with a crime.
Nasser traces both narratives from his namesake's hometown, Casablanca, Morocco, to the Naval Base at Guantánamo Bay. He also speaks to American intelligence and military officials, the former Guantánamo Bay detainee Mahamedou Salahi and other journalists, including Charlie Savage of The New York Times.
Nasser, who is Muslim American, also reflects on the ways his personal experiences compare to that of his subject's.
"There are parallels besides the name that felt very striking to me," Nasser said. "He is this nerdy suburban kid who is from a moderate Muslim family. He had inclinations toward science, dreams of higher education."
Jad Abumrad, the longtime "Radiolab" host, said in a phone interview that "The Other Latif" "is as much a story of fate as it is anything else."
In recent years "Radiolab" and its team have developed spinoffs like the Supreme Court series "More Perfect" and Abumrad's "Dolly Parton's America." But its first serial comes at a transitional time, with the recent departure of Abumrad's co-pilot, Robert Krulwich.
Nasser says he hopes to reach people who may have forgotten about the 40 detainees who are still being held at Guantánamo Bay.
"It's about this guy, but it's also about all of us," he said. "It's about what's being done in our name."
"The Other Latif" airs weekly on Tuesdays, starting Feb. 4.

Texto completo: Joshua Schulte, a computer engineer, gave reams of confidential documents to WikiLeaks exposing the agency's hacking tools, prosecutors say.
Three years ago, WikiLeaks published thousands of pages of secret documents about how the Central Intelligence Agency hacks into overseas targets, revealing its ability to compromise smartphones and turn certain televisions into listening devices.
The breach, known as the Vault 7 leak, was the largest disclosure of classified C.I.A. information in the spy agency's history and caused "catastrophic" damage to national security, the government said.
This week, Joshua Schulte, a 31-year-old computer engineer who worked at the C.I.A., began trial in federal court in Manhattan to defend against charges that he was the leaker.
When the documents went public in March 2017, WikiLeaks, the anti-secrecy organization, said in a statement that the source of the information wanted to raise "policy questions that need to be debated in public, including whether the C.I.A.'s hacking capabilities exceeded its mandated powers."
Prosecutors, however, say Mr. Schulte was a disgruntled C.I.A. employee who stole the documents as retaliation because he felt management did not take his workplace complaints seriously. He quit the job in 2016, four months before the WikiLeaks disclosures.
"For the C.I.A., it was the ultimate act of betrayal from one of their own," said David W. Denton, Jr., an assistant United States attorney, in the government's opening statement on Tuesday.
The trial will delve into the C.I.A.'s shadowy cyberoperations, as prosecutors seek to retrace the steps that they say Mr. Schulte took to extract the documents. Mr. Schulte worked in the C.I.A.'s Engineering Development Group and designed hacking tools, including malware that targeted the computers of suspected terrorists.
Mr. Schulte and his team, who were considered to be elite programmers, worked in a secret building protected by armed guards, Mr. Denton said.
The trial witnesses will include covert C.I.A. employees who will testify under pseudonyms.
"This prosecution is significant," said David I. Miller, a former federal prosecutor in Manhattan and a former C.I.A. lawyer. "It's not an everyday occurrence that there's a federal criminal trial involving the testimony of multiple current and former C.I.A. employees."
During the testimony of C.I.A. witnesses, reporters will not be allowed to describe their physical appearance. Their identities are so sensitive that prosecutors told Mr. Schulte's lawyers they could not even search for the witnesses on the internet in a way that would link their real names with the C.I.A.
Mr. Schulte faces 11 criminal counts, including stealing classified information from the C.I.A. and lying to the F.B.I. He has pleaded not guilty.
On Tuesday, Mr. Schulte's lawyer, Sabrina Shroff, said in her opening statement that the C.I.A. was under tremendous pressure to hold someone accountable for the embarrassing leak and targeted Mr. Schulte.
She said that the vulnerabilities in the C.I.A.'s computer system were widely known and that hundreds of employees and contractors had access to the same server as Mr. Schulte.
"The prosecution here simply has it wrong," Ms. Shroff told the jurors.
Mr. Schulte became the primary suspect within days of the WikiLeaks disclosure. Investigators obtained a search warrant to enter his New York City apartment, where they found dozens of electronic devices and more than 10,000 images and videos of child pornography, buried under three levels of encryption.
The authorities arrested him in August 2017 on child pornography charges. At the time, he was working as a senior software engineer for Bloomberg L.P., making $ 200,000 a year, according to his lawyer.
Prosecutors did not charge Mr. Schulte with stealing C.I.A. documents until 10 months later, a sign that they most likely struggled early on to build a case against him. He will be tried separately on the child pornography charges. (His former lawyer had argued that Mr. Schulte ran a business hosting a computer server for others and did not know what users were putting on the server.)
After Mr. Schulte's arrest, he was released on the condition he remain at home. He was thrown in jail a few months later after he violated a federal judge's order not to use the internet without the court's permission.
The case then took a bizarre turn. While in jail, he and another inmate smuggled in cellphones, prosecutors said, allowing Mr. Schulte to create a Twitter account under the name Jason Bourne, a fictional movie character who worked as a C.I.A. operative.
On social media, he accused the government of planting child pornography on his computer, according to court filings.
He also called reporters at The New York Times and The Washington Post to share sensitive information about the investigation, prosecutors alleged, and later disclosed classified information to his parents and others.
The Justice Department asked that Mr. Schulte be placed in solitary confinement within the jail unit reserved for the most high-risk, dangerous detainees. Two of the criminal charges against him relate to allegations involving his conduct during incarceration.
At trial, the government intends to show jurors Mr. Schulte's writings from notebooks he kept in jail. In one of them, he wrote that if the government did not pay him $ 50 billion in restitution, he would "visit every country in the world" and try to break up "diplomatic relationships, close embassies and U.S. occupation across the world."
The notebooks could help prosecutors establish a necessary element to convict Mr. Schulte of stealing the C.I.A. documents -- that he acted with the intent of either harming the United States or helping a foreign country.
Mr. Schulte's lawyers fought repeatedly to keep them out of the trial, saying his hundreds of pages of private musings were taken out of context and never disseminated.
A native of Lubbock, Texas, Mr. Schulte graduated from the University of Texas at Austin with a degree in computer engineering. He was always interested in computers and dreamed of working for the C.I.A., his lawyer said.
After interning at the National Security Agency, he worked for six years at the C.I.A., where he had the highest security clearances.
The trial testimony will take jurors inside the office politics of the C.I.A.
Mr. Schulte began feuding with a co-worker in the summer of 2015, a dispute that escalated after the co-worker complained to Mr. Schulte's supervisor about his workplace behavior, prosecutors said. Mr. Schulte responded by telling C.I.A. security officials that the co-worker had made a death threat against him, which prosecutors said was fabricated and without merit.
Mr. Schulte accused his bosses of favoritism, complaining that he got put on the "intern desk" while the other employee got a "prestigious desk with a window," prosecutors said.
Mr. Schulte was also angry that the C.I.A. had hired a contractor to develop a tool similar to one that he was trying to develop.
On Tuesday, Ms. Shroff conceded that Mr. Schulte was a difficult person who antagonized "almost every single person" at the C.I.A., but said that did not make him a traitor.
Some of his colleagues complained about Mr. Schulte using racial slurs at work, according to prosecutors. Mr. Schulte's lawyer responded in a court filing by saying the culture within Mr. Schulte's C.I.A. group "included the frequent use of language that would be considered racist and inappropriate in any other workplace."
As his workplace problems snowballed, prosecutors said, Mr. Schulte downloaded the internal documents on an evening in April 2016, attempted to erase his digital fingerprints and later gave the files to WikiLeaks.
Mr. Schulte's lawyer said in her opening statement that the government will not be able to offer evidence linking him to WikiLeaks. She also questioned why the C.I.A. did not detect the breach until almost a year later, when WikiLeaks published the information.
The founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange, was criminally charged last year by federal prosecutors in Virginia in a separate case for his role in obtaining and publishing secret military and diplomatic documents in 2010.
In an unusual move, Mr. Schulte has already said in court filings that he plans to testify in his own defense.

Texto completo: Only a handful of states and territories will try to pick the Democratic nominee with similar practices as Iowa, where officials faced delays and problems reporting results.
As Iowa grapples with the aftermath of a Democratic caucus that one party leader called a "systemwide disaster," American voters and election officials are already looking ahead at the handful of other states and American territories that will be picking -- or trying to pick -- the Democratic nominee in similar ways.
The number of states that hold caucuses has been dwindling for years, in part at the encouragement of the Democratic National Committee to use a government-run primary. Kansas, Maine and Hawaii are among the latest states to opt for a primary system, which often allows more people to participate than caucuses.
In Iowa and elsewhere, caucuses have been criticized for typically taking place only for a few hours of the day and in venues away from a voter's usual precinct. There were more than 1,600 precincts in Iowa on Monday, at schools, libraries, gymnasiums and other venues. There, Democrats gathered in groups to declare their support for one candidate or another -- and to compete for undecided voters.
But, because state parties decide the rules of each system, not all caucuses work like Iowa's. Some of the states that have kept their caucuses have made major changes to try to make them more inclusive.
Next up, Nevada
On Feb. 22, Nevada Democrats will hold their caucus, capping off four days of early voting that will start on Feb. 15.
Democrats in Iowa have been criticized for holding the caucuses at night, a time that makes it harder for parents or people who work in the evenings to participate. They responded by setting up satellite caucuses.
In Nevada, the Democratic Party has added caucus sites to the back of casinos so casino employees working that day can participate. Republicans canceled their caucus in Nevada this year.
Democrats in the state are also providing caucus materials in Tagalog, in addition to English and Spanish, and are allowing people to vote early instead of having to participate in person.
But there is concern that Nevada, which has 48 delegates, could face some of the same problems Iowa faced Monday night, specifically trouble with an app that was supposed to tally and report results.
Democrats in Iowa used an app built by Shadow Inc., a for-profit technology company that was also used by the party in Nevada. On Tuesday, the state party chairman William McCurdy II said it would not use the app or vendor.
Nevada Democrats, he said, "can confidently say that what happened in the Iowa caucus last night will not happen in Nevada."
American Samoa
American Samoa, a United States territory since 1900, has 11 delegates and will hold its caucus on March 3, which is Super Tuesday -- when more than a dozen states vote in primaries.
A cluster of small islands that sit between Hawaii and New Zealand, American Samoa does not participate in the general election. In 2016, Democrats there picked Hillary Clinton, the eventual party nominee.
Republicans on the islands, who picked Donald Trump in 2016, will hold their caucus on March 24.
North Dakota
The state Democratic Party on March 10 will hold a traditional "firehouse" style of caucus, where voting takes place in an open area rather than in a closed polling booth.
But the party will also offer voters the chance to cast their ballots by mail as long as they are postmarked by March 3. The party picked Senator Bernie Sanders in 2016.
Mr. Trump will be the only presidential candidate on the ballot for Republicans during the party's caucus on March 10.
The state Republican Party chairman, Rick Berg, told The Bismarck Tribune he expects the caucus to be "an evening of getting together with Republicans across the state."
Wyoming
Democrats will hold their caucus in Wyoming on April 4, when, for the first time, voters will be able to rank their choices.
Voters will be allowed to rank up to five candidates instead of having to choose only one.
It is a system being piloted in Alaska, Hawaii and Kansas, and was first tried in Maine in 2018.
Like Nevada Democrats, registered voters do not have to show up to caucus sites to be counted. They can drop off their completed ballot or fill it out on March 28. A total of 18 delegates are up for grabs in the primary.
Nina Sanchez Hebert, a spokeswoman for the Wyoming Democratic Party, said each caucus location would have a secure computer and Wi-Fi connection to transmit encrypted files, like ballots.
Paper ballots would be "securely retained" by county officials in case a hand count became necessary, she said. And officials would not employ the app created by Shadow Inc. to tally or report results.
"We are not using the same, or any, app to tabulate or transmit results," Ms. Hebert said.
The majority of caucus voters picked Mr. Sanders as the Democratic nominee in 2016 and Mr. Trump as the Republican nominee. Republicans will pick their nominee by holding conventions.
Guam
Guam, an American territory in the Pacific Ocean about 128 miles south of the Northern Mariana Islands, will hold its Democratic caucus on May 2.
Democrats in the territory, which has 12 delegates, picked Mrs. Clinton in 2016. Guam also cannot participate in the general election.
Virgin Islands
Democrats in this United States territory will hold their caucus on June 6. The territory has a total of 13 delegates and picked Mrs. Clinton in 2016.
American citizens living on the Virgin Islands cannot vote in the general election.

They Aimed For Fairness, But It Got Complicated

Texto completo: It has to do with the 2016 presidential contest between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, and Democrats' concerns about transparency.
DES MOINES -- You're probably wondering how we ended up in this situation. It's the morning after the Iowa caucuses. We were promised four sets of results, and we didn't even get one.
Blame 2016.
A lot of reasons contributed to the fiasco on Monday, chiefly a breakdown of the process by which caucus leaders were supposed to report results to the Iowa Democratic Party.
But one factor was baked into that process from almost the moment the caucuses ended four years ago.
Historically, the party had focused on highlighting only one caucus result: the number of delegates each candidate had earned for the state convention. The winner of the Iowa caucuses was the person who earned the most state delegates, which translate into national delegates, which determine the nomination. This year, however, the state party chose to release four results from the caucuses.
That's because in 2016, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton edged out Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont in the state delegate count by a quarter of a percentage point, earning roughly 700 to Mr. Sanders's 697. That meant 23 national delegates for Mrs. Clinton and 21 for Mr. Sanders -- an inconsequential difference between the two rivals.
Mr. Sanders's 2016 campaign fought for an audit in Iowa -- comparing the reported results with the papers on which caucus leaders had recorded voters' preferences -- and accused the state Democratic Party of a lack of transparency.
Largely because of Mr. Sanders's objections, the party decided to release additional numbers in 2020 that it had always logged but never made public: the number of supporters each candidate had in the first round of voting and the number he or she had in the second round, after nonviable candidates were eliminated and caucusgoers realigned.
The idea was that all this data would provide a fuller picture of each candidate's strength.
Under the old reporting system, for instance, a candidate who received 14 percent support -- just below the threshold for earning delegates -- would be indistinguishable from a candidate who received 1 percent support. But in the raw vote totals, they could get credit for the support they had in the first round -- and in a state where perceptions of strength and political momentum matter much more than delegates, that sort of credit can be crucial.
So the caucuses go: They have always been more about creating momentum (or the perception of it) for candidates than about the number of delegates they award. Iowa's contribution to a candidate's total number of delegates is trivial. But the state's contribution to popular conceptions of political viability is immense.
What matters most is how voters across the country view the outcome in Iowa. Having four sets of results from the 2020 caucuses, as opposed to one set of results in 2016, was widely seen as possibly providing more opportunities for candidates to cite the most favorable set of data as evidence of political momentum.
Another consideration for Mr. Sanders in 2016 was that, because of the realignment process and the arcane rules by which delegates are allocated, it was possible that he might have actually received more support than Mrs. Clinton in the first round's raw vote. But because only the delegate count was released, there was no way to know.
Once the results from Monday night are confirmed and released, we will indeed have a more complete map of how the candidates did than we have in any previous election cycle. But the need to report four sets of results instead of just one was a major factor in the debacle, as the state party struggled with what it called "inconsistencies" in all that data.

Texto completo: While stopping short of an outright ban, the social media company plans to label or take down material that appears to have been digitally manipulated.
Twitter, bowing to pressure from its users, said on Tuesday that it would more aggressively scrutinize fake or altered photos and videos.
Starting in March, the company said, it will add labels or take down tweets carrying manipulated images and videos. The move, while short of an outright ban, was announced one day after YouTube also said it planned to remove misleading election-related content on its site.
Twitter's new policy highlights a balancing act -- between allowing parody and removing disinformation -- that social media companies face as they try to more aggressively police the content posted to their platforms.
To determine whether a tweet should be removed or labeled, Twitter said in a blog post, it will apply several tests: Is the media included with a tweet significantly altered or fabricated to mislead? Is it shared in a deceptive manner? In those cases, the tweet will probably get a label.
But if a tweet is "likely to impact public safety or cause serious harm," it will be taken down. Twitter said it might also show a warning to people before they engaged with a tweet carrying manipulated content, or limit that tweet's reach.
"Our approach does not focus on the specific technologies used to manipulate or fabricate media," said Yoel Roth, Twitter's head of site integrity. "Whether you're using advanced machine learning tools or just slowing down a video using a 99-cent app on your phone, our focus under this policy is to look at the outcome, not how it was achieved."
The company developed its rules after surveying more than 6,500 users, civil groups and academics, said Del Harvey, Twitter's vice president for trust and safety.
They found that about 70 percent of surveyed Twitter users believed it was unacceptable for the company to take no action against manipulated content. More than 90 percent said such content should be removed or placed behind a warning label saying the video or image had been altered.
"Things that distort or distract from what's happening threaten the integrity of information on Twitter," Ms. Harvey said.
Like other social networks that have tried to crack down on bogus content, Twitter will be under pressure to consistently apply its new rules.
Samantha Bradshaw, a researcher at the Oxford Internet Institute, said that defining harm was not always clear, especially in the context of social media. "And it would be difficult to automate these responses on a global scale," she said.
Last year, an altered video of Speaker Nancy Pelosi that made it appear that she was slurring her words spread across the internet. Another heavily edited clip of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. falsely made it seem as though he had made racist remarks.
Mr. Roth said the manipulated videos of Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Biden would get a label under Twitter's new policy. Depending on what a tweet sharing the video said and if it caused harm, Mr. Roth said, Twitter could take the tweet down.
Last year, Twitter said it would add warning labels to hide messages from major political figures who broke the company's rules for harassment or abuse. Normally, those tweets would be taken down, but the company argued that they would be newsworthy enough to remain on the platform. As of Tuesday, Twitter had not yet used the labels.
In January, Facebook banned "deepfake" videos from its platform. But the company said the videos of Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Biden would not be removed under the policy because they had been edited with video editing software, not artificial intelligence.
YouTube banned misleading political content on Monday as part of a new policy ahead of the presidential election in November.

A Striking Rise in Crime Last Month Intensifies Debate Over Bail Law's Effect

Texto completo: The police commissioner blamed the bail overhaul for the increase, but supporters of the law said he was spreading misinformation.
New York City's police commissioner on Tuesday blamed the state's new bail law for a sharp rise last month in serious crimes, warning again that the law allows violent criminals to go free and risks eroding the city's historic improvements in public safety.
But supporters of the law responded that it was far too early to draw any conclusions about its impact, saying that the data was being framed in politically irresponsible ways.
Precipitous increases in crimes like robberies, shootings and auto thefts drove a 16.9 percent increase in overall crime last month compared with January 2019, according to police data.
At the same time, the number of murders was down from 29 to 23, and the number of rapes was dropped.
Law enforcement experts say crime statistics can rise or fall in any given month for numerous reasons and explain that it is far more important to track trends over longer periods of time.
But the police commissioner, Dermot F. Shea, maintained that the new bail law, which was approved by the Legislature last year and went into effect on Jan. 1, was clearly responsible for the spike.
"I stand by that," Commissioner Shea said at a news conference, referring to an opinion piece that he wrote in The New York Times last week, "New York's New Bail Laws Harm Public Safety."
He said the new law forces judges to release people even if they are believed to pose a risk to others.
"I think that, you know, with the passing of the new law, we saw a pretty, pretty, pretty dramatic increase in the people that were let out of Rikers in accordance with the law and that's something that we will deal with," he said.
Mayor Bill de Blasio acknowledged that the city had seen effects "emanating from this law for months," suggesting that the impact of the bail law started before Jan. 1. The courts began following the new guidelines in November to avoid a last minute crush of people who were released from jail.
Neither the mayor nor the commissioner offered data or analysis to support their contention that the law was behind the increase.
Bail was originally intended as a tool to ensure that defendants showed up for court appointments. But supporters of the changes to New York's law said the system had ended up penalizing people who were unable to afford bail, forcing them to rely on expensive bail bonds or remain behind bars while their cases moved through the courts.
The new law is intended to ensure that most people arrested on criminal charges are free while their cases are pending. Judges are no longer allowed to set bail for most misdemeanors and nonviolent felonies, including stalking, assault without serious injury, burglary, many drug offenses and some kinds of arson and robbery.
Opponents have pointed to a string of crimes committed by people who were released before trial as anecdotal evidence that the law needs to be rolled back. But on Tuesday, supporters of the law, including public defender organizations and civil liberties groups, lashed out at the mayor and police commissioner.
Nicole Triplett, policy counsel of the New York Civil Liberties Union, said the police commissioner and mayor were "manipulating statistics to fit their misguided narrative that giving low-income New Yorkers the same privileges as wealthier people is somehow linked to crime."
"For the past two decades, New York City has reduced both its jail population and the use of cash bail, resulting in some of the lowest crime rates we have ever seen," she said. "We cannot let the distortions, falsehoods and purposeful fear-mongering that has spread over the past few weeks discredit these long-overdue changes."
The police recorded a total of 8,437 serious crimes in January, compared with 7,215 in January 2019.
The Police Department's chief statistician, Chief Michael LiPetri, did not mention the bail law when he discussed the primary drivers behind increases in assaults, shootings, robberies and car thefts in January.
One of the largest increases was in robberies, which rose to 1,290 last month from 943 in January 2019, an increase of nearly 37 percent, according to police records.
Chief LiPetri said the increase was being driven by teenagers who have been robbing other teenagers of electronic devices in greater numbers than before. People younger than 18 committed 26 percent of robberies, he said.
He said 21 of the 67 shootings last month involved people who were recently released from jail or prison and were on probation or parole -- the highest rate recorded since 2003, when the city began recording the data.
In Albany, the Assembly speaker, Carl Heastie, a Bronx Democrat, defended the law against the growing calls from prosecutors and police chiefs to scale it back.
Asked about the city's objections, Mr. Heastie said he did not know "how much data" anyone could have in such a brief time period.
"You've probably had thousands of people who have probably been arrested," he said. "But the only stories that seem to be written are ones that some people blame the bail law."
However, he added that there were instances when "the system could have done a better job in keeping someone who they feel shouldn't have been back out on the streets."
Some lawmakers have suggested that the bail law be revisited as part of negotiations over the state budget, which is due by April 1. But Mr. Heastie said he did not want to commit to that time frame, or any other, for evaluating the new law. He said that the changes in bail law still have the strong support of the Democratic majority.
"When you ask for these type of revisions you have to have concrete data, concrete information, not just sensationalized or leaked stories to the newspapers," he said.
He complained that media is not covering stories about those helped by the law, "people who have gone through the system, been able to go back to work, were able -- while they wait for their day in court -- to not have their family lives disrupted."

Texto completo: To the Editor:
Re "Court to Decide Whether Employers Must Offer Birth Control" (news article, Jan. 18):
When the Supreme Court debates the right of employers to refuse coverage of birth control for their employees, one fact cannot be overlooked: Each form of birth control holds powerful health benefits separate and distinct from preventing pregnancy.
Some are approved for these noncontraceptive indications by the Food and Drug Administration: The hormonal intrauterine device is first-line therapy for heavy menstrual bleeding, and many brands of birth control pills are approved for the treatment of acne and/or premenstrual mood disorders.
The three most common contraception methods (the pill, the hormonal IUD and the copper IUD) have powerful protective effects against uterine cancer, the most common gynecologic cancer. Long-term use of the pill halves the lifetime risk of ovarian cancer, the most lethal of gynecologic cancers.
The health and financial burdens to women and society of unplanned pregnancy are one reason to ensure access to birth control. The health benefits that birth control provides -- independent from contraception -- are a critical second.

A Debacle That Adds To Doubts About It All

Texto completo: "It's hard to look at Washington or look at Iowa and think that our national politics is working."
DES MOINES -- The diagnosis can appear unanimous.
Bipartisanship? "Broken," former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has said.
The criminal justice system? "Broken," Senator Bernie Sanders ruled last year.
The grand American bargain? "I know what's broken," Senator Elizabeth Warren has promised, "and I know how to fix it."
But what if it's all broken? And no one knows how to do anything?
In a political era that can zag instantly from madcap to grave, somber introspection to sure-why-not nihilism, the Iowa caucus fiasco appears to have landed with uncommon force, at once deflating volunteers and voters whose earnest participation in democracy had by Tuesday hurtled quickly into tragicomedy and reviving for some anxious Democrats a persistent pang that this moment can feel beyond repair.
This week, President Trump is expected to win a Senate acquittal on charges that at least one Republican lawmaker has essentially conceded were proved. His approval ratings have never been higher.
His State of the Union address on Tuesday night included a handshake snub of Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a surprise Presidential Medal of Freedom ceremony honoring the conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh and a public speech-tearing coda from Ms. Pelosi before the dais had cleared.
"It's hard to look at Washington or look at Iowa and think that our national politics is working," said Amanda Litman, the executive director of Run for Something, a group that encourages Democrats to seek local office. "If all they absorb is chaos, that further disillusions people."
At its best, Iowa has always required a certain suspension of cynicism -- a belief that, against much anecdotal evidence to the contrary, the republic might just be sustained by a series of semi-chaotic mini-elections in high school gymnasiums. That the system's potential demise came, at least in part, at the hands of technological confusion registered on Tuesday as a particularly cruel turn for a state that has long prized a kind of analog, person-to-person campaigning.
The result, before any actual results, was a muddle of campaign claims and counterclaims about momentum that may or may not exist, with candidates swaggering about their performance before any full data set existed to disprove it and their supporters trading conspiracy theories about the cause of the reporting delay.
"One candidate is calling the results into question because he apparently didn't do well," said Deval Patrick, the former Massachusetts governor and current low-polling presidential hopeful. "Another is declaring victory without any votes being confirmed. The way to beat Donald Trump isn't to act like Donald Trump. Our party and our country deserve better."
The logistical anarchy of Monday evening has already accelerated calls to strip Iowa of its privileged status as the first stop for prospective presidents. The state's top Republicans, including Gov. Kim Reynolds, issued a statement on Tuesday defending Iowa's nominating perch, and Mr. Trump said he would protect the tradition as long as he is president.
But as the state's caucus-counters and national Democratic leaders slogged through a bleary, clarity-free Tuesday morning, the most pervasive emotion may have been defeatism. The angst multiplied for progressives with news that Michael R. Bloomberg, the billionaire former New York mayor, plans to escalate an already ubiquitous advertising campaign for his presidential bid.
Some moderates immediately argued that the messiness of Iowa has only validated Mr. Bloomberg's bet on bypassing the early states to focus on contests in March and beyond. And Republicans suggested that the mishap should disqualify the rival party from executive governance altogether.
"Dems right now can't even stand in a gymnasium and count how many people move under each sign," Senator Ted Cruz, the 2016 winner of the state's Republican caucuses, tweeted on Tuesday. "These are the people who want to be put in charge of our health care & everything else in our lives?"
Straining for analogies, political minds on Tuesday invoked an episode from Mr. Cruz's days as a young lawyer on George W. Bush's 2000 presidential campaign: the Florida recount and its attendant mayhem.
Was the "coding issue" bedeviling Iowa Democrats the new "hanging chad"? Could the Supreme Court be summoned to sort out the holdup?
Some veterans of the Florida affair wondered if the comparison might be unfair. To Florida.
"What's happening out there makes the recount look quite orderly and structured," said Mac Stipanovich, a longtime strategist and lobbyist who played a pivotal role in 2000 advising Katherine Harris, Florida's Republican secretary of state at the time.
Mr. Stipanovich said he was reminded of a scene from the movie "Patton" in which a soldier on the floor who said he was "trying" to get some sleep was complimented for at least knowing what he was trying to do.
"There ain't even a soldier asleep on the floor in Iowa," Mr. Stipanovich said.
Others have been more charitable. Projecting that he would leave Iowa "victorious" as the results remained unresolved, Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., applauded residents for their apparent foresight.
"Tonight, an improbable hope became an undeniable reality," he declared.
Because Iowans, Mr. Buttigieg said, a bit hopefully, had turned back "the broken politics that got us here."

Texto completo: The president emphasized a "blue collar" boom in his speech to Congress. But workers in those industries have seen a slowdown -- or even losses -- in jobs.
WASHINGTON -- President Trump used his State of the Union address on Tuesday to tick off a laundry list of economic gains, citing record low unemployment for women, higher incomes for households and a "blue collar" boom that he said is underway across America.
The speech showcased what will be Mr. Trump's primary message as he heads into a re-election campaign that he hopes will be a referendum on the United States economy. But it also overstated the strength of an economic expansion that has slowed or stalled for parts of his base.
"Jobs are booming. Incomes are soaring. Poverty is plummeting," Mr. Trump said. "America's fortunes are on the rise." He added, "I am thrilled to report to you tonight that our economy is the best it has ever been."
The economic expansion has now reached its 11th year, a record for the modern era of economic statistics in the United States. Unemployment sank to 3.5 percent in December, down from 4.7 percent when Mr. Trump took office. Workers' wages are growing, particularly for those in the jobs that pay the least, like retail clerks and restaurant workers. The stock market, which is one of the president's favorite gauges of economic success, is up about 20 percent from a year ago.
Forty percent of Americans say they are better off financially than they were at the same time last year -- double the number who say they are worse off, according to a survey conducted last month for The New York Times by the online research firm SurveyMonkey. That is the brightest economic outlook respondents have expressed in the three years the survey has been conducted. Independent voters, a particularly crucial electoral bloc, reported a surge in confidence in the latest survey.
And yet the economy grew faster under several of Mr. Trump's predecessors than it has on his watch. When he bragged of the economy's strength on Tuesday, Mr. Trump frequently cited "record" low rates of unemployment and poverty, which are in part attributable to the low and falling rates he inherited from former President Barack Obama.
The economy's improvement has also slowed on several fronts since last year, particularly in the president's favored blue-collar sectors like mining and manufacturing.
Mr. Trump declared in his 2019 State of the Union speech that "an economic miracle is taking place in the United States, and the only thing that can stop it are foolish wars, politics or ridiculous partisan investigations."
Over the last year, the president's economic policies have not delivered anything close to the miracle he had promised to white working-class voters in the industrial Midwest. Combined employment in construction, manufacturing and mining grew more slowly last year than at almost any other point in the current expansion.
Job growth has slowed sharply -- from 2.6 percent at the start of 2019 to 1.3 percent at the end of the year -- in so-called middle-wage sectors that include mining, construction and transportation, according to calculations by Nick Bunker, an economist at the Indeed Hiring Lab. That blue-collar slowdown is driving the deceleration of job growth across the United States economy.
Mr. Trump's policies have also not revived employment in coal mining, as he promised; the sector lost 1,000 jobs nationwide in 2019, according to the Labor Department. Primary metals manufacturing, which includes the steel and aluminum industries that Mr. Trump claimed to have restored with tariffs, shed about 12,000 jobs in 2019.
Employment growth in manufacturing, which Mr. Trump promoted in his speech last year, slowed to fewer than 50,000 jobs in 2019 -- the worst rate of his presidency and the second worst of the long recovery from recession.
Mr. Trump nodded implicitly to that slowdown in his speech on Tuesday night. Last year, he claimed, incorrectly, that the United States had created 600,000 factory jobs during his tenure. On Tuesday, he revised that number down to "half a million," which is the correct figure.
Many economists blame the economy's deceleration on the trade wars Mr. Trump has waged with China and other countries that send steel, aluminum, washing machines and solar panels to the United States.
Economic growth slowed to 2.3 percent last year, according to data released last month by the Commerce Department. That is a percentage point less than what Mr. Trump's advisers predicted for the year. Across Mr. Trump's three years in office, growth has never reached the 3 percent rate that administration forecasters have projected. It has fallen well short of Mr. Trump's campaign promises of 4, 5 or even 6 percent annual rates.
Independent economists expect only modest growth this year from the initial trade deal that Mr. Trump reached with China and the revamped North American trade pact that he signed last week.
And while Mr. Trump signed a large tax cut in 2017, it has failed to produce the sustained investment boom that he and Republicans promised. After surging in 2018 following a cut in the corporate income tax rate, business investment shrank for the final three quarters of 2019.
Investment has now grown more slowly in the quarters after the tax cut than it did in the eight years, including the end of the Great Recession, under Mr. Obama.
Mr. Trump's only mention of business investment was in reference to opportunity zones, a creation of the 2017 tax law that bestowed tax incentives on investors who put money into projects in so-called distressed communities. He did not directly mention the corporate rate cuts that were the centerpiece of the 2017 law, nor the investment decline.
Mr. Trump did not propose a new round of tax cuts, as his advisers had hinted he might. His most substantial economic policy proposal was to call on Congress to pass a bipartisan family leave law that has been championed by his daughter Ivanka Trump.
The president was unequivocal in saying that his policies had fundamentally transformed the economy.
"The days of our country being used, taken advantage of and even scorned by other nations are long behind us," he said. "Gone, too, are the broken promises, jobless recoveries, tired platitudes and constant excuses for the depletion of American wealth, power and prestige."
Other analysts say Mr. Trump has benefited from a historically anomalous economic stimulus while unemployment is low. The Federal Reserve ended a slow march of interest rate increases last year and slashed rates instead, spurring growth and stock gains. Combined with military and other federal spending increases that bipartisan majorities in Congress passed and Mr. Trump signed into law, the tax cuts have helped to swell the federal budget deficit to $ 1 trillion a year.
Mr. Trump did not mention the Fed, a frequent target of his criticism, or the growing deficit in his speech.

Texto completo: For over a year, we've perused the robust field of Democratic presidential candidates, squeezing them like melons in the produce aisle. We've wondered whether some are too old or too young. We've speculated about whether the nation is ready for a female president or, perhaps, a gay one. We've analyzed who would fare best in a debate against Typhoon Trump.
None of this will really matter until Democrats resolve the overarching issue dividing the party. With the Iowa caucuses kicking off the primary season Monday, Democrats must settle on a winning approach to governing.
The issue was drawn into sharp focus recently when the editorial board at The New York Times, despite "more than a dozen hours" questioning the leading Democrats, became paralyzed – not over candidates but over the direction the party should take. The paper broke with its 160-year tradition and gave dual endorsements. to Sens Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota.
What stumped the Times was what it identified as a choice as between "the radical and the realist models." You might think of these positions as "ultra-progressive and center-left," and you might view them as "lanes" rather than "models." Semantics aside, the two wings of the party – which have always been part of modern Democratic posturing – are in a fierce struggle.
Do Democrats want to fix the mess created in President Donald Trump's first term, or blow it up? That's what this primary is really about.
Polling leaders among fixers are former Vice President Joe Biden, former South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Klobuchar, who just Wednesday broke into double digits in Iowa. The duo most in favor of blowing things up are Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren.
The time for picking a lane is at hand. Much as I admire the ultra-progressive agenda, I favor staying closer to the center in this election.
As I see it, the far left represents 90% of what I favor, has a 50% chance of beating Trump and, if elected, can get 40% of what I support through Congress. The center-left represents only 75% of what I favor but has a 60% chance of beating Trump, and it, too has the very same 40% chance in Congress. Bottom line: We wind up in the same place legislatively, but the centrist Democrats have a better chance of winning in November.
In presidential elections, candidates in both parties tend to sketch out somewhat extreme positions during the primaries, and then, out of necessity, move closer to the center for the general election. The problem facing the Warren/Sanders wing this year is that rigidity is part of the appeal – and that approach is reflected among many supporters.
That makes it harder and more time-consuming to temper positions that could be damaging in the general election. And the longer the party takes to establish its governing strategy, the greater the risk that Democrats will not rally enthusiastically around the eventual nominee. We saw that in 2016 when some Sanders supporters remained cool to Hillary Clinton.
It's said that government is so broken that blowing things up is the only option. But if victory in November requires appealing to moderates, some of whom might have voted Republican in 2016, then the sledgehammer approach could be too much.
Also, the ultra-progressives make an easy target for Trump. All he has to do is say "socialist" a dozen times at each campaign rally and he triggers fear – even if unreasonably – among voters who might otherwise abandon him.
Klobuchar and Buttigieg are making the most compelling cases for a center-left approach. Warren, who has an early polling advantage against both of them, who has already softened her approach to dismantling the health care system, could be the Democrats' top choice if she continues to moderate her positions.
She must assure primary voters that her long-term goals do not warrant short-term fears.
The Democrats' best bet will be the candidate who favors progressive policies while acknowledging that in this election the HOV (High Occupancy Voter) lane runs down the center, not the far left.

Japan races to build more coal-burning power plants

Texto completo: Just beyond the windows of Satsuki Kanno's apartment overlooking Tokyo Bay, a behemoth from a bygone era will soon rise: a coal-burning power plant, part of a buildup of coal power that is unheard-of for an advanced economy.
It is one unintended consequence of the Fukushima nuclear disaster almost a decade ago, which forced Japan to all but close its nuclear power program. Japan now plans to build as many as 22 new coal-burning power plants - one of the dirtiest sources of electricity - at 17 different sites in the next five years, just at a time when the world needs to slash carbon dioxide emissions to fight global warming.
"Why coal, why now?" said Kanno, a homemaker in Yokosuka, the site for two of the coal-burning units that will be built just several hundred feet from her home. "It's the worst possible thing they could build."
Together the 22 power plants would emit almost as much carbon dioxide annually as all the passenger cars sold each year in the United States. The construction stands in contrast with Japan's effort to portray this summer's Olympic Games in Tokyo as one of the greenest ever.
The Yokosuka project has prompted unusual pushback in Japan, where environmental groups more typically focus their objections on nuclear power. But some local residents are suing the government over its approval of the new coal-burning plant in what supporters hope will jump-start opposition to coal in Japan.
The Japanese government, the plaintiffs say, rubber-stamped the project without a proper environmental assessment. The complaint is noteworthy because it argues that the plant will not only degrade local air quality, but will also endanger communities by contributing to climate change.
Carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere is the major driver of global warming, because it traps the sun's heat. Coal burning is one of the biggest single sources of carbon dioxide emissions.
Japan is already experiencing severe effects from climate change. Scientists have said that a heat wave in 2018 that killed more than 1,000 people could not have happened without climate change. Because of heat concerns, the International Olympic Committee was compelled to move the Tokyo Olympics' marathon events to a cooler city almost 700 miles north.
Japan's policy sets it apart from other developed economies. Britain, the birthplace of the industrial revolution, is set to phase out coal power by 2025, and France has said it will shut down its coal power plants even earlier, by 2022. In the U.S., utilities are rapidly retiring coal power and no new plants are actively under development.
But Japan relies on coal for more than a third of its power generation needs. And while older coal plants will start retiring, eventually reducing overall coal dependency, the country still expects to meet more than a quarter of its electricity needs from coal in 2030.

Texto completo: Cold Tahini Noodles With Vegetables 6 servings Among the selling points for these noodles as a brown bag lunch: they're at their best when served cold, they keep well, and, depending on how many vegetables you mix in, they can serve as either a hearty meal or a light snack.
The sauce is the key. It combines several pantry staples to create a nutty, bright, creamy, spicy coating for noodles and thinly sliced carrot, cucumber, bell pepper and scallions " or whatever other veggies you have in the fridge.
Many sesame noodle recipes call for fresh or frozen Chinese egg noodles and sesame paste. This adaptation substitutes a couple pantry staples in dried udon noodles and tahini.
Add shredded poached boneless skinless chicken breast or cubed pan-fried tofu if you'd like to bulk the recipe up.
Adjust the heat to your liking by adding or subtracting some of the chili-garlic sauce.
MAKE AHEAD: The assembled dish can be refrigerated for up to 4 days.
Based on a recipe from the New York Times.
Ingredients Kosher salt
1 pound dried udon noodles (may substitute Chinese egg noodles or whole-wheat linguine)
2 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon sesame oil
2 tablespoons unseasoned rice vinegar
2 tablespoons tahini
1 tablespoon smooth peanut butter
3 1/2 teaspoons low-sodium soy sauce
1 tablespoon sugar
1 tablespoon peeled fresh ginger root, finely grated
2 to 3 teaspoons chili garlic sauce
1 large carrot, scrubbed well and cut into 2-inch long matchsticks
1/2 English cucumber, seeded and cut into 2-inch long matchsticks
1 medium red bell pepper, seeded and cut into thin 2-inch-long strips
2 scallions, thinly sliced
1/4 cup chopped roasted unsalted peanuts (or 1 teaspoon toasted sesame seeds)
Steps Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil over high heat. Add the noodles and cook for 8 minutes, or until just tender. Drain the noodles, rinse with cold water, drain again and transfer to a large bowl. Add 1 teaspoon of the sesame oil and toss to coat.
In a medium bowl, whisk the remaining 2 tablespoons sesame oil, the rice vinegar, tahini, peanut butter, soy sauce, sugar, ginger and chili-garlic sauce.
Pour the sauce over the noodles and toss to coat. Add the carrot, cucumber and bell pepper and toss to mix it together.
Sprinkle the scallions and peanuts (or toasted sesame seeds) on top before serving.

Why Iowa’s ‘High-Tech’ Caucus Failed (and Why Other States Are Ditching Election Apps)

Texto completo: Elections are, at their cores, extremely low-tech affairs. Voters vote, and someone else tallies up and reports the results. A caucus, which is how Iowa chooses to select the delegates who then go on to party conventions this summer to choose a candidate, are even more analog: Instead of voters voting, with a pencil and paper or a punch-card, people show up to a meeting and stand around, leaving the use of tools—the pencil-pushing—to someone else.
So how did things go so horribly awry last night in Iowa, where the Iowa Democratic Party chose to dispense with the “old things that work” and instead rolled out to its 1,600 precincts an untested, $70,000 app of questionable necessity that ultimately did not function—to the point that results are still not available by midday Tuesday, and only “partial results” are promised early Tuesday evening, with the candidates already moved on to New Hampshire?
The answer’s not terribly complicated. The Iowa Democratic Party trusted an app, built in secret by a politically connected company called Shadow, Inc. that did not work, and they had no backup plan. And now, other states are already ditching plans to use technology to aid the ancient democratic process and relying on paper trails—which, according to some technology experts, is what they should have been doing anyway in the face of cybersecurity threats.
State party honchos insist, first and foremost, that there was no hacking and that there was “only” “inconsistencies” in the data sets precinct chairs were supposed to report.
NEW statement from @iowademocrats — "While the app was recording data accurately, it was reporting out only partial data. We have determined that this was due to a coding issue in the reporting system." pic.twitter.com/kOXdcvggoe
— Maura Barrett (@MauraBarrettNBC) February 4, 2020
In a statement issued on Twitter on Tuesday afternoon, Shadow said that its app’s collection of precinct-level data was “sound and accurate, but our process to transmit that caucus results data generated via the app” to the state party “was not.”
Unimpressed and fully aware of how using the app might undermine confidence in the process and thus depress turnout, the Nevada State Democratic Party, which paid Shadow $58,000, announced Tuesday that it would not be using the app.
But it wasn’t just that the Iowa Democratic Party chose to use an app that was slapped together in two months and wasn’t “property tested at a statewide scale,” as The New York Times reported. Nor was it that precinct chairs didn’t get training, nor was it just that the app wasn’t even downloaded by every precinct chair, and ultimately didn’t work when the precinct chairs did—getting stuck on various steps of the process, or seeing inconsistent numbers posted when they did get through—even though all of that is true.
It was that nothing worked.
The old method, in which precinct chairs simply phoned in their results to state party headquarters, where someone there would then slide beads along an abacus, also didn’t work. Precinct chairs reported waiting on hold upwards of an hour, or being turned away at state party headquarters after physically driving there to present results.
One precinct chair, who told CNN he was on hold for more than an a hour and a half, had the ignominy of being hung up on, while still on air with the network’s Wolf Blitzer.
“When you have an app that you’re sending out to 1,700 people and many of them might be newer to apps and that kind of stuff, it might have been worth doing a couple months’ worth of testing,” Sean Bagniewski, the chair of the Polk County Democratic Party, told The New York Times.
According to CNN, Democratic insiders are blaming a “major coding error” in the software for the problems. At the same time, it could have been much, much worse: Iowa Democratic Party leadership ditched an earlier plan for individuals to participate in a “virtual caucus,” in which they would “vote by phone,” over serious security concerns.
It’s also not entirely clear why the IDP chose Shadow to build its app—although there are some theories! Founded by Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama campaign veterans who have also worked for the Democratic National Committee, Shadow and its apparent parent company, called ACRONYM, appear to have much more political expertise than they do programming acumen. As CNN reported, only a handful of the team, which was apparently headquartered in a Washington, D.C. WeWork, had any significant software development experience.
We will apply the lessons learned in the future, and have already corrected the underlying technology issue. We take these issues very seriously, and are committed to improving and evolving to support the Democratic Party’s goal of modernizing its election processes.
— Shadow, Inc. (@ShadowIncHQ) February 4, 2020
As the Huffington Post reported, ACRONYM pitched itself to fundraisers, as well as party outposts, as a technique to bridge the supposed “digital divide” between the Democrats and President Donald Trump, who has spent more than $20 million on more than 218,000 Facebook ads. But there is a vast difference between digital advertising and digital election tools. It may be a long time before any outfit dares to experiment with the latter—which, if you are concerned about the integrity of elections, may be a very good thing.
In the meantime: Shadow appears to be hiring.

Texto completo: The apparent failure of the software designed to report votes in the Iowa Democratic caucuses is the kind of scenario that keeps software developers up at night: A new application goes live, but it just doesn't work.
Party officials in Iowa on Tuesday were trying to figure out why the system used by election officials could not deliver complete results Monday night. The confusion illustrates the risks inherent in launching an app.
“Until you deploy something in the actual situation, there's always the possibility that no matter how the designers tested it, there could be something that they didn't anticipate that creates a problem," said Stephen S. Intille, a professor at Northeastern University who teaches about human-computer interactions.
That's why computer science has entire disciplines focused on testing for usability, functionality, and security. And based on the information made public so far, many observers say they doubt Iowa Democratic party officials did enough to ensure their technology would work.
Doron Reuveni, chief executive of Applause, a Framingham company that specializes in user testing for applications, suspects the launch was put on the fast track to have it ready in time for the caucuses. “They had a plan to test, that would be my guess, because everybody does," Reuveni said, "and they probably rushed to release it . . . and someone decided to cut corners on the testing."
Iowa Democratic party officials worked with a company called Shadow Inc. to create an application for reporting results directly to the state party. But party officials said the results received through the app were not complete, so it is collecting paper records from more than 1,600 caucus sites to ensure that its tallies are accurate.
The app was was put together over two months, The New York Times reported, citing people briefed by the state party. Some said the app had not been properly tested on a statewide scale. One person told the Times there were concerns the app would malfunction in areas with poor online connectivity, or because of high bandwidth use, such as when many people tried to use it at the same time.
The Washington Post reported that a breakdown in reporting on the app was among the scenarios used in a role-play exercise in Des Moines last fall by the Defending Digital Democracy Project at Harvard's Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs.
Iowa's geography and the complexity of the caucuses probably made the software more difficult to test, with precincts spread across hundreds of miles — each with dozens of voters.
That could have made some quality-control measures — such as rolling out the software to one group to see how it works on a smaller scale before making it widely available — more difficult. But Reuveni and others said the software could easily have been tested with users on various kinds of devices, on different networks, and in a variety of situations to ensure it functioned properly.
He said software developers must “test in the wild, in environments and configurations that are close to where the app needs to really work and function . . . on real devices that simulate the real-life scenarios."
At a time when trust in public institutions is low, the failure to ensure the app worked properly could have serious implications, observers say.
“If the mistake was simple, the consequences are disastrous, because they go to confidence — the reliability of our democratic processes," said Juliette Kayyem, a former top official in the Obama administration's Department of Homeland Security who teaches at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government.
Kayyem said President Trump's rhetoric about the potential for rigged elections and illegal voting only raises the stakes to ensure that voting infrastructure functions properly.
The inability of the software to carry out its basic purpose has many people wondering what else its developers did not catch. Though the state Democratic party said there are no indications that Monday's problems were caused by a cyberattack, questions have been raised about the software's security.
“Maybe it wasn't the case in this particular incident, but you're starting to think, how easy will it be to impact these primary elections processes — maybe even other state and local election processes that rely on similar systems with similar low levels of assurances," said Israel Barak, chief information security officer at the Boston cybersecurity firm Cybereason.
Barak said he hopes what happened Monday will sound an alarm about the integrity of such systems. While security for the general election has become a top national concern since Russia's interference in the 2016 presidential vote, Barak said he'd like to see the same level of vigilance applied to primaries.
“We need to treat the security of the election process, from top to bottom, as the security of a critical infrastructure," he said. “Without a secure and assured election process top to bottom, that is very likely a direct impact on the ability of our society and economy to function."

Would your wages rise in 'Medicare for All'? Yes

Texto completo: Hidden in the larger debate over "Medicare for All" is a fundamental economic question: Who pays for work-based health insurance?
For the 157 million Americans who get health insurance through their work - or through the job of a spouse or parent - the answer may seem obvious, evident right on pay stubs. Employers pay most of it, and workers pay some.
Last year, work-based coverage per person cost $7,188, with employees directly contributing 18% on average. Family coverage cost $20,576, of which employees paid 30%.
But what seems obvious is not always what is correct. Regardless of what is on your pay stub, many health economists believe that your employer's contribution toward health insurance comes out of your wages.
So will Medicare for All cause wages to rise if employers have to spend less on benefits? Research suggests the answer is "yes," with the caveat that it may not be matched dollar for dollar for everyone. The precise relationship depends on the nature of the labor market, which varies across markets and jobs.
The economic theory that explains why employees foot the bill for health insurance is this: Whether it is in dollars or health insurance, what matters to workers is the total value of their compensation for work. (There are other workplace benefits, but none anywhere near as costly and important as wages and health insurance.)
In a competitive and fluid labor market - where there are many similar employers and workers, and little difficulty in hiring or switching jobs - an employer that tries to undercut the prevailing market rate risks losing workers to competitors. Likewise, a worker who demands more could well be passed over for another who will accept the prevailing rate for total compensation.
"Yes, an individual worker might get a little more or less than market compensation from time to time," said Steven Pizer, a health economist at the Boston University School of Public Health. "But if employment is fluid, there's just no way, according to the theory, for that to happen consistently."
One option under Sen, Bernie Sanders' Medicare for All plan would reduce employer spending on health insurance by $9,000 per employee and raise taxes on the wealthy. Sen. Elizabeth Warren's plan would also raise taxes on the wealthy but would aim to tax employers an amount intended to match what they would have spent on health care anyway.
In a Democratic debate in September, Sanders differed with Joe Biden in saying wages would rise if employers were no longer involved with health benefits. Many Americans are skeptical; in a Kaiser Family Foundation poll, 63% said their wages would stay the same if their employers' health costs fell.
Some studies in economics support the theory that employers trade off health insurance premiums for wages almost dollar for dollar. A study in the Southern Economics Journal examined salary and benefits data from the New York Department of Education in the 1970s. Controlling for confounding factors like teaching experience, education, school budget and other benefits, the study found that a dollar increase in the value of health benefits was associated with an 83-cent reduction in salary on average.
But other studies of public-sector employees find little to no evidence of a comparable tradeoff between wages and health insurance premiums. One, in the Journal of Health Economics and based on data from over 6,000 school districts, found that a dollar increase in benefits was associated with a reduction in wages and salaries of only 15 cents.
Another from the same journal, in which Harvard health economist Michael Chernew is a co-author, used national surveys of public-sector workers and employers' data and produced similar findings.
Why might premium and wage changes not perfectly offset each other in public-sector jobs? One possibility is unionization, which is more likely in the public than in the private sector. Unionized workers are better able to bargain for higher compensation than individual workers, who are more easily let go and replaced with others. Negotiated contracts could end up with health insurance benefits increasing without offsetting reductions in salary.
"One reason unionized public-sector workers may be unwilling to fully pay for premium increases with reduced wages is that the higher premiums reflect things they do not fully value," Chernew said. "For example, workers may not be willing to sacrifice already low wages for higher health care prices that don't reflect better health care."
So much for the public sector; what about the private one? Here, many studies suggest closer to a one-to-one trade-off between workplace health insurance premiums and wages. Some of these studies focus on specific benefits, like maternity care, or on different populations, like those with obesity, finding that their higher costs to employers are offset by lower wages.
The wage issue is just one of the trade-offs involved with Medicare for All. There are also healthy debates about how much taxes would rise and how much costs would fall.
Ultimately, someone would have to pay for Medicare for All, so not everyone would be better off. But to the extent the cost of health insurance is shifted away from employers and to the federal government under Medicare for All, it seems wages would rise, at least for some people.

Texto completo: The 43rd stamp in the Black Heritage series honors Gwen Ifill (1955-2016), one of the nation's most esteemed journalists. The stamp was unveiled Thursday, Jan. 30,2020, at Metropolitan African Methodist Episcopal Church in Washington, D.C. It features a photo of Ifill taken in 2008 by photographer Robert Severi. Among the first African Americans to hold prominent positions in both broadcast and print journalism, Ifill was a trailblazer in the profession. U.S. Postal Service art director Derry Noyes designed the stamp.
Serving as a longtime co-anchor of PBS' NewsHour and moderator and managing editor of "Washington Week with Gwen Ifill," Ifill was an important voice for not only the Black community but for all of America, covering eight presidential campaigns.
She was the first African-American woman to host a prominent political talk show on national television.
"Gwen Kill's contributions to journalism touched not only our members but impacted citizens across the country," said National Association of Black Journalists (NABJ) President Dorothy Tucker. "We are grateful that the USPS is recognizing her influence and has chosen to celebrate her in such a beautiful way."
Ifill joined PBS in 1999, reporting on politics for NewsHour and moderating Washington Week. In 2013, she was named co-anchor of PBS' flagship evening news program along with Judy Woodruff.
She was one of the most successful journalists to make the transition from print to television, including prominent reporting roles at The Washington Post, New York Times and NBC News.
Ifill was inducted into the NABJ Hall of Fame in 2012.
Since 1847, the Postal Service stamp program has celebrated the people, events and cultural milestones unique to the history of the United States. The 2020 stamp subjects continue this rich tradition.
"These miniature works of art offer something for everyone interested in American history and culture," said U.S. Postal Service Stamp Services acting Executive Director William Gicker. "From notable figures such as golf legend Arnold Palmer and esteemed journalist Gwen Ifill to the cultural phenomenon of hip hop to a celebration of the great outdoors, this program is wide-ranging and adds to the history of our great nation as recorded through the U.S. stamp program.

Is coronavirus a greater threat to health of Blacks?

Texto completo: As we watch the frantic efforts to control the spread of the killer coronavirus that's sweeping the world, I couldn't help but wonder what would happen if we were to be hit, hard, by the virus here in the United States. Is there is a possibility we would see it follow the same pattern of racial health disparities as we do in other health conditions and diseases? With the United States as we all know, African Americans are affected disproportionately by every disease and health condition (I'm sure there's no need to elaborate).
Even though we all would like to think of racial segregation as something that is in the past because it was legally outlawed in the U.S. by the Civil Rights Act of 1964, it continues today. African Americans and Latino people are more likely to live among their own racial group than they are among whites.
Even though I knew that what I found would be depressing, I had to look at the statistics from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), just to see what the current data said about how "we" fared, as it relates to infectious diseases, in general, in this country. According to NIAID, "the African Americans account for about 13% of the U.S. population, yet represent almost half of new AIDS diagnoses; 21% of reported ТВ cases in U.S.-born persons; 55.4% of reported gonorrhea cases, 38.1% of reported syphilis cases, and five to seven times the rate among white men and women of reported chlamydia cases; among the highest rates of chronic hepatitis C and hepatitis C-related deaths compared to other ethnic groups."
Just as I thought.
While pharma, governments, private donors and the medical community have focused attention on surveilling and controlling diseases of poverty in the developing world, what often gets lost in that conversation is that the neglected diseases can strike people in any nation where the gap between rich and poor is wide and growing. So, if you're like me; poor, Black or in an urban area in this country, you need to pay attention to the coronavirus.
It is estimated that upwards of 12 million Americans have a disease linked to extreme poverty.
Already, we have a group of chronic and disabling conditions - the "neglected diseases of poverty"- afflict hundreds of thousands of people in the United States. These diseases exist almost exclusively among the poor and communities of color (particularly women and children), and are a major contributor to the vast social and health disparities. They have a devastating impact on childhood development, maternal and child health, and worker productivity, and most concerning, trapping individuals and communities in a continuous cycle of sickness and poverty.
Poverty and disease are stuck in an ongoing, vicious relationship. One goes a long way towards intensifying the other with studies demonstrating that infection rates of certain diseases are highest in regions where poverty is rife.
What does this all mean? Poverty is instrumental in cultivating conditions that allow disease to spread. In turn, infectious diseases exacerbate certain factors that contribute to poverty. In many parts of the world, healthcare is not free nor is it cheap, placing huge financial stress on families who may already live under the poverty line.
We already know, all too well, that social determinants of health, including wealth, followed by good access to medical and healthcare, can tell you everything you need to know to predict health outcomes.
Millions of Americans may be living with a disease linked to extreme poverty, of which hookworm is just one. Those affected are more likely to be people of color В African American, Latino or Native American Kwho live in communities too often ignored by the rest of the nation. They may lack proper sanitation; they could also be exposed to disease-carrying pests or have inadequate health care.
Although neglected tropical diseases are not as common in the United States as HIV/AIDS or asthma, the New York Times has called neglected tropical diseases the "new plague of poverty" because of its disproportionate effect on people already living in poverty, who often lack access to health care and basic infrastructure.
One of the underreported issues in this problem is that much of the data on the prevalence or incidence of infectious disease in poor communities never leaves the emergency room, hospital, or the doctor's office. Since 1961, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention collects and publishes data about such diseases from all over the country. While states voluntarily report such data to the federal government, each state has its own laws requiring the medical community to share information when it encounters certain diseases.
While a study in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) showed that, for the first time since 1980, fewer Americans are dying from infectious disease but not for everyone; the outcome gap for Blacks and the poor has gotten wider.
I will continue my mission work of "shining a light" and bringing attention to the fact that there are people who are supposedly members of an equal society, who suffer needlessly and die sooner and quicker than others in the same society. Sadly, one thing I the evidence has shown us about health disparities: If all of the people impacted were wealthy, the powers that be would have found a solution a long time ago.

Texto completo: MOSCOW - A leaked air-traffic control audiotape captures the frantic minutes after an Iranian Revolutionary Guard unit mistakenly launched a missile that downed a Ukrainian airliner that had just taken off from Tehran's international airport.
After a transcript of the recording was released by a Ukrainian news site Sunday, Iran halted its cooperation with Ukraine's inquiry into the disaster, already described as reluctant, officials said. The Iranians said they expected such evidence would have been kept confidential.
On the tape, an Iranian air traffic controller can be heard talking to a pilot on an arriving Iranian plane, who appears to be the first to warn of trouble.
"Flares on route, as if from a missile," the pilot reported. "Should anything like this be happening there?"
"We were not informed of this," the controller said. "What does this light look like?"
The reply: "That surely is the light from a missile."
When the controller then tried to raise the crew of Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752, there was no response.
The Iranian pilot reports seeing an explosion, then sought reassurance:"Is our course OK?"
"Yes," the controller said. "I don't think there will be any problem for you."
"God forbid!" the pilot responded.
The missile killed all 176 people on the Ukrainian plane at a time of already high tensions as the United States and Iran traded attacks in the region, raising fears of further violence.
Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, verified the audio recording's authenticity and said it had been obtained by Ukrainian crash investigators. The Iranians did not dispute its authenticity.
Its leak to the news site seemed to reflect frustration among Ukrainian government officials over what they said was Iran's lack of cooperation in the inquiry, particularly its refusal to hand over the downed plane's black boxes.
While the Iranian government has admitted that the Guard fired on the place, it did so only after three days of stonewalling. And even then, President Hassan Rouháni insisted that the truth had been concealed from him and ather members of the elected government by the air defense urit of the Guard.
In an interview with Ukrainian media, Zelenskiy claimed that the exchange captured on the tape made clear that Iranian authorities knew almost immediately that a missile had brought down the plane, though the air traffic controller is the only government worker heard on the audio tape. He did not provide any evidence rhat the controller quickly shared that information with government officials.
Zelenskiy did not directly contradict the Iranian government's claim that it had been kept in the dark, but he noted that even the military - which knew what had happened - continued to issue false statements. Those included a claim that the crash had been caused by mechanical problems. That, he said, showed a broad effort to suppress the truth in those first three days.
"We understood that ihe Iranians - we were not sute exactly who - but they wanted to defend themselves in such an unlawful way, by pushing information that it was a technical flaw," Zelenskiy said.
The recording begins a few minutes after Ukrainian Flight 752 took off from Imam Khomeini Airport in Tehran on Jan. f.
At the time, Iran's air defenses were on high alert amid tensions with the United States. An American drone had recently killed a top Iranian security commander, Gen. Qassem Sole.mani, and Iran had retaliated by firing missiles at U.S. forces on bases in Iraq.
Iranian military officials said that an air defense crew - fearing an American counterattack - had fired on the civilian airliner in error, and that it took time to investigate the circumstances. The government said the generals had for days dragged their feet ir. sharing this information witn elected officials.
Iranian officials have said the leadership of the Revolutionary Guard, which is subordinate only to Iran's theocratic leader as well as the regular military knew the crew of a mobile anti-aircraft system had fired missiles, but effectively sidelined the elected government by creating a secret investigative committee.
That committee examined data from the airport, radar networks and witnesses including the missile crew, Iranian officials said. It was not clear if this committee blocked access to the air traffic control recordings.
Zelenskiy, in the interview, said Iran's air traffic controllers did not, in any case, provide the recording to Ukrainian investigators who traveled to Iran. He said Ukraine had obtained it independently, a claim disputed by the director of Iran's Civil Aviation Organization.
The aviation director, Hassan Rezaifar, told Mehr, a semiofficial news agency, that Iran had provided it to the Ukrainians.
The victims of the plane's downing included 82 Iranians, 57 Canadians and 11 Ukrainians. Zelenskiy said the Iranian government had offered $80,000 to the families of each Ukrainian victim, but that he had rejected the offer as insufficient.

Texto completo: Some children lost a stable home when a parent succumbed to opioid addiction. Others were forced to stay in hotels after hurricanes or fires destroyed their homes. Still others fled abuse or neglect.
More than 1.5 million public school students nationwide said they were homeless at some point during the 2017-18 school year, the most recent data available, according to a report from the National Center for Homeless Education released last week.
It was the highest number recorded in more than a dozen years, and experts said it reflected a growing problem that could negatively affect children's academic performance and health.
"The ripple effect here is real," said Dr. Megan Sandel, a director of the Grow Clinic at the Boston Medical Center, who said housing instability was associated with developmental delays in children and children in fair or poor health.
The center, which is based at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro and is funded by the U.S. Department of Education, issued the report on Jan. 29. Its findings came asa housing affordability crisis sweeps the nation and homelessness continues to rise.
The report compared the 2017-18 school year with the 2015-16 school year and found a 15% increase in the number of students nationwide who experienced homelessness.
The 2017-18 number was more than double the nearly 680,000 homeless students reported in 2004-05, the first school year examined by the center, its director, George Hancock, said.
The report also showed a 137% increase, to more than 102,000, in the number of students who while homeless reported staying in "unsheltered" places, such as abandoned buildings and cars.
Tire center compiles figures submitted annually by states to the federal government that include students who said they were homeless for even brief periods during the school year. Homelessness could mean sharing homes with other families during times of economic hardship or spending a night in a homeless shelter.
The numbers influence the distribution of federal and state funds for homeless programs. They capture only what was reported by state or local officials. Numbers from Vermont, for example, were not included for the 2017-18 school year because the state did not provide them in time.
Texas reported the largest increase over the three school years, with the number of homeless students doubling, to more than 231,000 in 201718. Fourteen states reported a decrease.
The report did not offer reasons for the changes but experts pointed to diverse factors that may have helped drive the totals in a troubling upward direction.
"It is complex, depending on where you are in the country," said Barbara Duffield, executive director of SchoolHouse Connection, a nonprofit based in Washington that supports youths who are homeless.
Severe natural disasters could drive the increases, particularly in Texas and Florida, which had a 32% rise, Duffield said. Both states were hit hard by storms that ravaged thousands of homes.
She said a lack of affordable housing, the opioid and methamphetamine addiction crises, and fluctuations in local economic conditions - a factory shutting down, leaving parents unemployed and unable to pay rent, for example - all influence the rise in homeless students.
In many cases, districts have been getting better at identifying which students are homeless.
"We definitely see that when school districts pay more attention, when they invest in training, when they get out into the community, then the numbers also go up," Duffield said.
In Santa Rosa County, Florida, which is on the Gulf Coast, the school district identified more than 1,000 students of a total population of nearly 28,000 as having experienced homelessness in the 2017-18 school year.
The majority live with other families, also known as "doubled up," said Karen Barber, the district's director of federal programs. She said most homeless students also have a single parent.
The numbers have declined in recent years as the local economy has improved and the district has expanded programs to help homeless students, she said. But rising housing costs have kept the figures higher than they should be, she said.
"We're not moving the needle as much as we could because of the lack of affordable housing," she said. "That really is the biggest issue."
She said district staff look for "red flags" that might indicate a student is homeless, such as recurring tardiness or an unpaid meal balance.
Duffield said many students are often "living in fear and shame." Some families do not report homelessness because they think it would constitute child abuse or neglect.
"People don't let their school officials know when they've been homeless," said Marybeth Shinn, a professor at Vanderbilt University who researches homelessness.
The annual numbers in the center's report most likely underestimate the problem. For example, they do not include private school students. An audit by California in November found that public school districts significantly undercounted the number of homeless students.
Shinn said the data also left out children who were not yet in kindergarten and who make up a significant portion of the overall number of homeless children.
The numbers, she said, do not capture the impact homelessness may have on children throughout their lifetimes.
"The question is: What are the long-term effects of homelessness on children, as opposed to the very immediate effects?" she said.

12 DEATHS IN MISSISSIPPI TELL A GRIM STORY THERE IS ONLY ONE WAY TO FIX THE AMERICAN PRISON SYSTEM

Texto completo: Twelve people have died in Mississippi state prisons since the start of the new year. Nine deaths occurred in the Mississippi State Penitentiary at Parchman. At least one was a suicide. Most were a result of violence between inmates: beatings, stabbings and other fatal altercations.
State officials have promised to stop the violence. After news of two of those deaths broke last week, Gov. Tate Reeves, a Republican who took office last month, said he would work "around the clock" with the state Department of Corrections to "respond immediately" and prevent new incidents "going forward."
What's striking about this situation is how little of it is new. The Parchman prison, which dates to 1904, has a long and infamous history of violence and abuse. It also has a history of reform. But no amount of change has been able to break the cycle of brutality. And why would it? The history of Parchman is a prime example of how dehumanization and neglect are intrinsic to separating people from their freedom.
The Mississippi of the late 19th century was a rigid apartheid state, its criminal justice system defined by cruel, gratuitous punishment. Black suspects bore the brunt of state violence. Often arrested for petty crimes like theft, gambling and "vagrancy" - traveling without a work permit or evidence of a job - black Mississippians were given hefty fines and lengthy sentences. They were then leased out to private companies for de facto slave labor on railroads and plantations. Conditions were abysmal.
"The prisoners ate and slept on bare ground, without blankets or mattresses, and often without clothes," writes historian David Oshinsky in "Worse Than Slavery: Parchman Farm and the Ordeal of Jim Crow Justice." "Convicts dropped from exhaustion, pneumonia, malaria, frostbite, consumption, sunstroke, dysentery, gunshot wounds, and 'shackle poisoning' (the constant rubbing of chains and leg irons against bare flesh)." In the 1880s, Mr. Oshinsky notes, the annual mortality rate for Mississippi's convict population ranged from 9% to 16%.
Convict leasing was on the wane by the turn of the last century, but Mississippi's white elite was still obsessed with "Negro crime." Enter Gov. James K. Vardaman. Elected in 1903 on a demagogic platform of rural chauvinism and white supremacy - he promised to tax the planters, give aid to the (white) poor and turn back "social equality" - Vardaman was a kind of reformer.
Under his leadership, the state cleared thousands of acres near the Yazoo-Mississippi Delta in an area called Parchman place, named after the family that had owned it for years. Workers planted crops and constructed prison buildings. The Parchman Penitentiary was born. By the 1910s, it was self-sufficient, operating on the same principles as an antebellum plantation, with black convict laborers supervised by white overseers, although the share of white prisoners would increase with time.
Parchman would, in short order, become notorious for its hard labor and brutality. (Blues musician Bukka White immortalized his experience of the prison in a 1940 song, "Parchman Farm Blues.") Inmates slept on dirt floors. Violence was common. In 1954, officials added a maximum security unit where one prisoner recalled, "They just beat the living crap out of you."
Serious reform would come after the civil rights movement with Gates v. Collier, a class-action lawsuit filed in 1971 on behalf of four inmates but constructed with testimony from hundreds of prisoners. They attested to murders, rapes, beatings and tortures; one inmate, Danny Bennett, died after he was shocked with cattle prods and left unconscious under the sun in 100-degree heat. They also spoke to poor conditions, from open sewage and polluted water supplies to "kitchens overrun with insects, rodents, and the stench of decay." A federal judge would describe the prison as "unfit for human habitation."
Decided for good in 1974, Gates would essentially create minimum standards for incarceration in the United States. At Parchman, this meant desegregation and civilian guards, freedom of worship, minimum living space and an end to forced labor. It also spurred the state of Mississippi to create a Department of Corrections to oversee its penal facilities.
But reform had limits. New facilities and professional staff don't change the fact that prisons are a place of confinement, where society isolates many of its least wanted and most vulnerable members. By the 1990s, according to a report from the American Civil Liberties Union, death row prisoners at Parchman - renamed Mississippi State Penitentiary - reported "profound isolation, unrelieved idleness and monotony, denial of exercise, intolerable stench and pervasive filth, grossly malfunctioning plumbing, and constant exposure to human excrement."
Parchman is hardly alone in its history of violence and neglect. If anything, it's just an extreme example of conditions that occur throughout American prisons. Even so, there's worse. Last year, the Department of Justice released a 56-page report on the Alabama prison system, where guards are few and far between and where prisoners experience high rates of homicide and sexual assault, where - The New York Times reported - "one prisoner had been dead for so long that when he was discovered lying face down, his face was flattened." The nation's jails - local facilities where arrestees are placed pending trial or sentencing - aren't much better. According to the most recent data, a 2015 report from the Bureau of Justice Statistics, 1,053 people died in local jails in 2014. The leading cause, suicide, accounted for 35% of those deaths.
Change, for Parchman and other facilities, will almost certainly come. We should understand, however, that reform is only ever temporary. There's only so much you can do within the paradigm of incarceration. A prison may or may not be humane, but it will always be dehumanizing. The isolation, the lack of liberty - the separation from family and community - are antithetical to human life. In which case, the only way to "fix" a problem like the American prison system is to end it. But for an unequal, racially stratified country like ours, that destination is on the far horizon, if it's on the horizon at all.

Texto completo: It was 22 years to the day since the last president to be impeached uttered the unforgettable words — “I did not have sexual relations with that woman, Miss Lewinsky" — and “that woman" was still trying to clear her name.
Monica Lewinsky was on Twitter, reminding journalists that there are names besides hers that could be used to invoke the last impeachment. Why not cite the year (1998) or the name of the president who was actually being impeached (Bill Clinton) rather than relying on that old familiar “Lewinsky Scandal"?
“Let's not frame it by the woman + youngest, least powerful person involved," Lewinsky wrote amid the current impeachment trial, prompting immediate apologies from some journalists.
Then came the haters. How about referring to “the consenting adult who knowingly seduced a married man?" one proposed. Another posted a cartoon sketch of a very recognizable Lewinsky, nearly naked. Another offered a Taylor Swift video GIF: “Oh there she goes, playing the victim ... again."
This is what it still is to be Monica Lewinsky in 2020.
The world's most reviled intern, blamed for nearly bringing down a presidency with a beret and a blue dress, faces humiliation and ridicule every time she stands up against online humiliation and ridicule. Now 46, she has impressed many on social media with her wit, self-awareness, and canny ability to seize the opportunity of the #MeToo movement. Reporters and feminists who dismissed her in the 1990s as just another bimbo are newly cognizant that many other women have been branded as bimbos, attention-seekers, and liars to serve a predator's purpose. They are looking at Lewinsky from a new sheepish perspective.
Yet to many Americans, Monica will always be Monica — someone whose narrative they helped write. She will never be viewed sympathetically by many who see her downfall as unforgivably consensual, a train wreck she gleefully engineered.
“Lewinsky is complicated because there's not really public consensus on whether she's a victim or an agent or some combination of the two," said Nancy Whittier, a professor of sociology at Smith College whose studies include women's movements, social change, and sexuality. “She has to walk a really fine line because she was a participant in this really politically charged moment, and she's trying to talk about her own experience and cyberbullying in a way that isn't politically aligned."
After a decade of self-imposed exile and earning a master's degree in social psychology from the London School of Economics, Lewinsky emerged six years ago as a social activist. She spoke at Forbes magazine's 30 Under 30 Summit, wrote a Vanity Fair essay about her experience, and delivered a 2015 TED talk called “The Price of Shame," in which she declared it was time to “take back my narrative."
This wasn't just about saving herself, she said. This was about all of us, the way we caricature and badmouth and bully one another online. Her talk addressed not just her own painful experience, but those of people like Tyler Clementi, the Rutgers University student who killed himself in 2010 after his roommate secretly recorded and circulated video of him kissing another man.
Dubbing herself “Patient Zero" in a global epidemic of online shaming, Lewinsky began speaking for all those put in the virtual public stockade — and these days, that could be anyone, she made clear. You no longer need to have an affair with a president to warrant worldwide humiliation. You could make a stupid quip on Twitter.
“When this happened to me, 17 years ago, there was no name for it. Now we call it cyberbullying," Lewinsky said in her TED talk.
That made Lewinsky's irreplicable experience relatable, her willingness to speak out about it.
“Talking about the emotional effects of that experience, talking about how that affected her personally, is really pretty savvy," said Whittier, noting that activists against domestic violence and rape have been most effective when focused on the personal impact.
Lewinsky also spearheaded public antibullying campaigns, including one that was nominated for an Emmy and a powerful new public service announcement — called “The Epidemic" — that forces viewers to confront the unseen impact of online bullying in real life.

And last week, she stepped into the partisan fray over President Trump's impeachment trial, chiding Republican senators for their unwillingness to demand witnesses and noting that she'd been compelled to testify on video.
Not everyone can hear that message from Lewinsky, though. A recent announcement that Lewinsky will be hosting “A Conversation on Shame and Survival" this spring at the New Bedford Lyceum, which markets itself as a community forum for open-minded intellectual debate, elicited online criticism that bordered on shaming.
“People feel quite strongly. Twenty years later to feel that strongly — I have to say, I'm a little surprised by that," said Patti Rego, director of marketing and communications for the Marion Institute, one of the organizers.
She, too, was dismayed by the whole torrid affair in 1998, finding it “stupid," she admits. And when she first heard that Lewsinsky was remaking herself as an activist, she thought, “Oh, Monica."
But Rego was floored by Lewinsky's TED talk and began reconsidering her own role in an early public shaming.
“We did her wrong. I did her wrong," said Rego. “They've made rap songs about her. She's almost like a verb."
Organizers renamed the May 15 talk — “A Conversation with Monica Lewinsky on Cyberbullying and the Culture of Humiliation" — to “give people one more chance to put aside their preconceptions," said Rego.
“She's got a personal story and she's using it to connect with people," said Rego. "But she's not asking us to forgive her. This is not the Monica Lewinsky apology tour."
Lewinsky has already apologized for her affair, and she acknowledges regret in her talks. Clinton, who was impeached but not removed from office for perjuring himself by denying their affair in sworn testimony, has apologized publicly but not directly to Lewinsky.
He reportedly expresses more remorse about her treatment in the upcoming Hulu documentary, “Hillary," which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival last month. “I feel terrible about the fact that Monica Lewinsky's life was defined by it, unfairly I think," Clinton is quoted as saying.
Hillary Clinton was also further defined by the episode, faulted for demonizing another woman and enabling her husband, who had been accused of seducing, harassing, and even raping women over the years. In the 2016 presidential campaign, Donald Trump brought those accusers to face Hillary Clinton at a televised debate. In the #MeToo era, Democrats and feminists have been reexamining their willingness to discount the testimony of women who accused a man they wanted to believe in.
In 1998, even feminist icon Gloria Steinem stuck up for Clinton, writing a controversial New York Times op-ed that argued some of his alleged passes at women didn't constitute harassment and that distinguished his relationship with Lewinsky as consensual.
In hindsight, even Steinem has high praise for Lewinsky. “How she has endured her unfair treatment is incredible to me," Steinem told the Globe last week. “And she has emerged smart and wise and kind and sane."
For her second act, Lewinsky is holding herself out as a symbol of resilience, telling other bullying survivors, “You can insist on a different ending to your story."
It's a very American construct. But families and cultures also play a role in shaping and reinforcing personal narratives, noted Kate McLean, a Western Washington University professor who studies them.
"We don't get to only tell our own stories," McLean said. “You can't say, 'Here's who I am now,' if no one believes you. Self and identity change is dependent upon the person wanting to change and other people hearing the new story."

Texto completo: Yes, “Hamilton” will return, as promised – this time for seven weeks.
But it’s not the only reason to get excited about the 2020-21 “Broadway on Hennepin” season, announced Monday afternoon by Hennepin Theatre Trust.
A few favorites will circle back, but most of the season will be touring productions new to Minnesota. All told, the 10 shows will bring 19 weeks of Broadway to the Orpheum’s stage. Together they have won 29 Tony awards, including three for Best Musical.
Let’s get right to it, in chronological order.
“Hamilton” (Oct. 6-Nov. 22, 2020). To ensure your “Hamilton” tickets, you’ll need to commit to the eight-show season package. For comparison, a pair of third-row seats to “Hamilton” at the Richard Rodgers Theatre in New York City, its Broadway home since Aug. 6, 2015, will set you back $2,261.05. (That was Monday’s surge pricing. It’s probably higher now.) Winner of 11 Tonys.
“To Kill a Mockingbird” (Dec. 15-20). Not a musical. Just “the most successful American play in Broadway history,” per “60 Minutes.” Oscar winner Aaron Sorkin’s adaptation of Harper Lee’s Pulitzer Prize-winning masterwork is another Tony winner.
“Oklahoma!” (Jan. 19-24, 2021). Not your grandparents’ (or great-grandparents’) “Oklahoma.” Stripped down and darker, Daniel Fish’s production tells a story of a community circling its wagons against an outsider. A Best Revival of a Musical Tony winner.
“Ain’t Too Proud – The Life and Times of the Temptations” (Feb. 16-28). The first musical by MacArthur “genius” Dominique Morisseau follows the Motown legends from the streets of Detroit to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Directed by Des McAnuff (“Jersey Boys”), with the Tony-winning choreography of Sergio Trujillo (“Jersey Boys” again).
“Jersey Boys” (March 16-21). The music- and dance-filled story of Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons. In 2018, the last time it was here, “Jersey Boys” was the show of the year.
Four Tony awards.
“Moulin Rouge: The Musical” (April 14-May 2). The musical version of Baz Luhrmann’s film (remember Nicole Kidman on a swing?) has been remixed with new tunes, including songs by Lady Gaga, OutKast and Katy Perry.
“The Prom” (May 18-23). A new musical comedy about big Broadway stars, a small town and love. Critics call it “big hearted,” “full of happiness” and “comic gold.”
“Cats” (June 8-13). “Cats” the musical, not, emphatically, “Cats” the movie. Andrew Lloyd Webber’s much-loved, long-running hit is back in a new production, including new choreography by Andy Blankenbuehler (“Hamilton) and direction by Trevor Nunn (“Les Misérables”).
“Hadestown” (June 22-27). Orpheus and Eurydice meet King Hades and Persephone in the musical that won eight 2019 Tonys (including Best Musical) and the 2020 Grammy for Best Musical Theater Album. Created by singer-songwriter Anaïs Mitchell and director Rachel Chavkin (“Natasha, Pierre & The Great Comet of 1812”).
“Tootsie” (July 27-Aug. 1). A “hilarious, thoroughly modern Tootsie” and New York Times Critics’ Pick, based on the Oscar-nominated film, with a Tony-winning book by Robert Horn and a clever score by Tony winner David Yazbek (“The Band’s Visit”).
The seven-show subscription package (starts at $290) includes “To Kill a Mockingbird,” “Oklahoma,” “Ain’t Too Proud,” “Moulin Rouge,” “The Prom,” “Hadestown” and “Tootsie.” For the eight-show package (starts at $345), add “Hamilton.” All subscribers are guaranteed the same seats for each show. “Jersey Boys” and “Cats” may be added to a package. Call 1-800-859-7469 or stop by the State Theatre box office.
Tickets for individual shows will go on sale to the general public at later dates.
The picks
Now at HGA Gallery in the U’s Rapson Hall: “Elizabeth Scheu Close: A Life in Modern Architecture.” Close was a rarity: a woman practicing architecture in the mid-20th century. With her husband, William Close, she founded the state’s first architecture firm dedicated to modernism, leaving an indelible mark on our built landscape and blazing a trail for future generations. This exhibition precedes a biography of Scheu Close forthcoming from the U of M Press in April 2020 and was curated by its author, Jane King Hession. Gallery hours 9-5 p.m. Monday-Friday, 1-5 p.m. Saturday. Free. Closes April 26. A book signing and closing reception will be held April 20 from 5:30-7:30 p.m.
Tonight at the Ordway Concert Hall: Accordo with Silent Film. You experience silent films differently when they’re accompanied by live, original music. You experience live, original music differently when you’re watching a silent film. In 2016, the chamber group Accordo gave its first concert of music by composer Stephen Prutsman, who joined them on piano as Buster Keaton’s “Sherlock Jr.” and the 1920 silent horror film “The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari” flickered on a screen nearby. Now in its fifth year, this delightful evening has become an annual thing. Tonight’s concert will feature four films (two old, two new) and music by three composers: Prutsman, John Novacek and Schubert Club Composer-in-Residence deVon Russell Gray. 7:30 p.m. FMI and tickets $36/31). If you’re curious about how this all got started, here’s the story.
Tonight at the Playwrights’ Center: “Malvolio .” With the Guthrie’s production of Shakespeare’s “Twelfth Night” just around the corner (previews start Saturday, Feb. 8), Betty Shamieh’s “Malvolio” is perfectly timed. Part of PWC’s 2019-20 Ruth Easton New Play Series, this sequel to Shakespeare’s romantic comedy finds Malvolio, now a famous general, fighting an endless war and encountering Volina, the daughter of Viola and Orsino. Doors at 6:30 p.m., performance at 7. Free, but seating is limited and reservations are required.
Wednesday and Thursday at Icehouse: Voxspex Featuring the Instrument of Hope. Keyboardist Lara Bolton created Voxspex, a fusion of opera tunes and trained voices with soul, jazz and pop performed on drum kit and keyboard, not the usual orchestra. For four performances at Icehouse, she arranged to borrow the Instrument of Hope, a trumpet made of bullet casings by Shine MSD, a nonprofit begun by students of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. For Bolton, the connection with gun violence is personal: her two sons knew Philando Castile. The singers at Icehouse will be soprano Brittany Renee, tenor Dominique Wooten and baritone Nicholas Davis (seen most recently in Minnesota Opera’s “Flight”); Omar Abdulkarim will play the Instrument of Hope. Shows at 6:30 and 9 p.m. both nights. FMI and tickets ($20 advance, $25 door). Here’s a sample of Voxspex, without the trumpet.
Thursday at the Heights Theater: “Moonrise.” To make winter even darker, the Heights is screening a brilliantly titled series called “Cheap, Mean and Deadly: Noir from Poverty Row.” Turns out you don’t need fancy studios, big stars and budgets to make a good film. What you need is a good story. The studios that produced these films were Hollywood’s déclassé cousins, but you’ll be sitting on the edge of your seat. Directed by Frank Borzage, “Moonrise” stars Dane Clark, Gail Russell, and Ethel Barrymore in the tale of Danny Hawkins, who becomes a hunted man, just like his father. 7:30 p.m. FMI and tickets ($12). The series continues for four more Thursdays (through March 5). It’s being co-presented by the Trylon, so you can buy your tickets there if you prefer.

Texto completo: It appears the impeachment process will end Wednesday, with an acquittal. The Democrats and some pundits will say the Senate trial is a sham, and not a true acquittal since no additional witnesses and documents were called or allowed. The Republicans and still other pundits will say the House of Representatives’ impeachment itself was a sham, and that history will show it was partisan with no Republicans voting for it. The bottom line is that President Donald Trump was indeed impeached, and he was indeed acquitted.
I believe that even if former national security adviser John Bolton were to testify, and assuming what The New York Times said is in his manuscript is true, and ignoring cross examination by both sides, that the end result would still be the same: Most Democrats would vote “guilty,” and all Republicans, possibly joined by a few Democrats, would vote “not guilty” on each article. Democrats ask if the American people deserve to know what Bolton has to say? The answer is, yes. And they will in a few weeks when they read his book.
So what do we as a people, and more importantly, our elected officials, learn from all of this? I hope they learn that impeachment should not be brought unless there is bipartisan belief that the charges rise to the level of impeachment. That was not the case at all this time. This process that we were just put through was much too partisan by both sides.
It’s easy to look back and second guess, but I and some others suggested earlier on that the House should have just looked to censure the president for wrongdoing. In my opinion, that would have passed with bipartisan support.
I believe that we need to support moderate candidates who are willing, and pledge, to “reach across the aisle,” and accomplish legislation that benefits Americans.

Memories of impeachment charade will fade

Texto completo: With the end in sight to what can only be called “the impeachment pageant,” we can now expect a flood of “What did we learn?” essays.
There are no “lessons” here other than the abuse of power by members of a partisan majority in the House to raise profiles and profits for themselves. This chapter leaves a constitutional scar. This behavior is not what impeachment was intended for. President Donald Trump’s phone call did not include any offense, much less any impeachable one.
What we can expect to be remembered about this sorry episode is, sadly, “fake history.”
And fake history, it should be noted, just had a big weekend. Amazon ran an ad in the Super Bowl Sunday to promote Alexa. In a very funny commercial featuring Ellen DeGeneres wondering aloud what life was like before Alexa, a series of made-up events in history are amusingly recalled to contrast life today with life before Alexa was around.
The last sequence — funny even to me, the president of the Nixon Foundation — shows a make-believe Richard M. Nixon in the Oval Office telling an assistant to “remind me to delete those tapes.” (The assistant is shown balking at Nixon’s “request.”)
Of course, Nixon never ordered the tapes deleted.
But it would not surprise me if, in the future, when someone asks Alexa, “Alexa, what’s an example of ‘fake history’?” the device answers this way: “A television commercial about Alexa in the 2020 Super Bowl is an example of ‘fake history.’ ”
I raise this possibility as a reminder that our collective memory about an event often turns out very differently than the event itself. Trump is going to be acquitted, but what will the Super Bowl ads of 2070 say? Perhaps the writers of Sunday’s Alexa ad genuinely thought Nixon ordered his tapes deleted, or perhaps they didn’t care and wanted a laugh. The effect, though, will be to promote “fake history.” And “fake history” distorts collective memory.
An example: People today believe that at the time of his confirmation, Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas was guilty of sexual harassment of Anita Hill. That is not what was believed at the time. A New York Times/​CBS News poll taken Oct. 28, 1991, found the opposite: 58 percent of the respondents then believed Thomas’s account; 29 percent believed Hill’s.
We won’t know for 50 years what the impeachment of Trump does to his place in history, and we won’t know how today’s impressions will change tomorrow’s opinions.
My guess? Not much, given his outsize personality and growing list of achievements. These include (and you might want to take a seat here, Trump haters): rebuilding a U.S. military with a current budget of $716 billion (and a new service branch, the Space Force); the appointments of (so far) two Supreme Court justices, 50 appeals court judges and 133 district court judges; a massive tax cut; 3.5 percent unemployment; the country’s exit from the Iran deal and the Paris climate accords; clarity on China as the nation’s chief strategic competitor; a renewed Israeli alliance anchored in the relocation of the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem; the caliphate of the Islamic State destroyed and “most wanted” terrorists Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and Qasem Soleimani eliminated; partial construction of the border wall and significant immigration reform through executive order; a massive regulatory rollback; the passage of the USMCA; Obamacare’s individual mandate repealed; and “right to try” and justice reform legislation passed.
A partisan House’s impeachment is a pebble thrown at the political battleship that is that list. His most significant failing may lie ahead in the slow-out-of-the-gate response to the Wuhan coronavirus, but it surely won’t be his phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.
Trump accomplished all of the above despite the burden of the Mueller investigation, which could not, despite massive investment and effort, prove any collusion whatsoever between Russia and the Trump campaign in Russia’s attack on our 2016 election. That investigation was followed by this impeachment charade.
All that remains are ashes of the left’s hopes and a scar on the Constitution. And perhaps a forced attention on the Beltway when all eyes ought to have been on Wuhan.

American Dirt: When compassion gets canceled

Texto completo: In Ray Bradbury’s Fahrenheit 451, a firefighter finds his passion through book burning. The novel opens with a confession from its protagonist: “It was a pleasure to burn.”
Nearly 70 years ago, Bradbury predicted that book burning could become uncontroversial if people simply stopped reading. He didn’t predict that even book lovers would find their own targets to burn.
Just over one month into 2020, we might have seen the greatest literary controversy of the year. It doesn’t involve book burning, but it does involve Oprah, Salma Hayek, a seven-figure author advance, and an unforgivable thoughtcrime.
When Jeanine Cummins set out to write another book in 2013, she balked at the idea of writing from the perspective of a Latina woman. Cummins has a Puerto Rican grandmother, but “in every practical way, my family is mostly white,” she admitted in the New York Times several years ago.
So far, her stories had stayed fairly close to home. Her first book was a memoir, A Rip in Heaven, published in 2004. It recounted the violent murder of Cummins's two cousins and the aftermath that left her family reeling for years.
After that, Cummins switched to novels; first, The Outside Boy, a story about a young Irish gypsy who is discriminated against for his identity. Next, she wrote The Crooked Branch, a story about the Irish potato famine.
Cummins has Irish heritage, and her husband is an Irish immigrant. So far, she had, as the liberal gatekeepers would put it, “stayed in her lane.”
But with American Dirt, she wanted to do something different. Cummins hoped to write about Mexican immigrants to reveal what their plight looked like from their own perspective. This was back in the early 2010s — during the Obama administration and a few years before the national conversation about immigration became even more frenetic under President Trump.
The moment she began the novel, Cummins anticipated backlash. How would it look for a white author to write a story about Mexicans?
“I worried that, as a nonmigrant and non-Mexican, I had no business writing a book set almost entirely in Mexico, set entirely among migrants,” she writes in the author’s note. “I wished someone slightly browner than me would write it.”
Yet, she said at a recent book talk in Washington, D.C., “I felt I had something of value to contribute to the conversation.”
So she went forward.
“When I interacted with the people whose lives were most deeply affected by the crisis at the border, I saw what real courage looks like,” she explained, “and it made me sort of recognize the cowardice of being afraid to write a book.”
After years of research and two drafts she described as “bad," Cummins wrote American Dirt — this time, from the perspective of immigrants. The story follows Lydia and her son, Luca, as they flee Mexico for the United States after a drug cartel kills their family.
In its focus on innocent victims of a tragedy, Cummins says, American Dirt was a lot like her memoir, A Rip in Heaven. “I really wanted to take the stories away from the violent men who are at their center and give them to the people who suffered and endured that violence on the flip side,” she said.
It sounds as if Cummins had the best of intentions. She also benefited greatly from the novel. Publisher Flatiron Books won a contentious bidding war to claim the book, offering Cummins a seven-figure advance. The film rights were sold, and American Dirt even nabbed a coveted spot in Oprah’s Book Club.
“From the very first sentence,” Oprah gushed on CBS, “I was in.”
American Dirt earned back-cover blurbs from Stephen King, John Grisham, and Mexican-American writer Sandra Cisneros. Don Winslow called it a “Grapes of Wrath for our times.”
Then, as quickly as the book had gathered its name as 2020’s first must-read, it fell from grace. As soon as it came out on Jan. 21, Hispanic reviewers eviscerated the book, calling it insensitive, full of stereotypes, and even racist. Author David Bowles slammed it as a “harmful, appropriating, inaccurate, trauma-porn melodrama.”
Los Angeles Times writer Esmeralda Bermudez said American Dirt owed its success to a “low standard.”
“This is a wonderful, melodramatic telenovela, something I would love watching for cheap entertainment, like a narco-thriller on Netflix,” she said. “But this should not be called by anyone ‘the great immigrant novel, the story of our time, The Grapes of Wrath.’”
Despite Cummins’s supposedly painstaking research, from visiting both sides of the border to enlisting Hispanic readers, she seems to have little knowledge of Mexican culture.
As Bowles writes in his review, the passage where Lydia scoffs that La Lechuza, “the owl,” is an unscary name for a drug lord, makes sense only to non-Hispanic readers.
“A ‘lechuza’ is a screech owl,” he writes. “They have been feared throughout Mexico for literally THOUSANDS OF YEARS, considered harbingers of death, witches in disguise. Lydia’s reaction is that of the White readers, not actual Mexicans. And this is just one of literally dozens of examples.”
Online critics couldn’t stop criticizing the book, from its contents to its accompanying aesthetic: the barbed wire floral decorations at a publishing event and Cummins’s barbed wire manicure, which one critic called a “fetish.”
Mexican author Reyna Grande, who blurbed the book, partially walked back her endorsement, saying, “When the criticism started to be heard, I understood where they were coming from, and I do think the Latino community is making some valid points. After I blurbed the book, I found out about the bidding war and the seven-figure advance, and I felt hurt. I felt undervalued, and I was angry as well.”
Latino authors are told that immigrant stories don’t sell, Grande says, yet suddenly, publishers “fight each other for the privilege” to publish Cummins’s story.
Cisneros, however, has added no such caveat to her support.
“It’s going to be someone who wants to be entertained, and the story is going to enter like a Trojan horse and change minds,” she said in response to the backlash. “And it’s going to change the minds that, perhaps, I can’t change.”
While some critics complained about Cummins's ethnicity, and one New York Times reviewer spent much of her review worrying that she, as a white woman, was not the right one to review the book, others had a much simpler criticism.
“The real failures of the book, however, have little to do with the writer’s identity and everything to do with her abilities as a novelist,” wrote literary critic Parul Sehgal.
The worst you can really say about American Dirt comes from its own pages, in a description Lydia offers about a friend’s poem: “It was both grave and frivolous.”
The truth, as is almost always the case with these sorts of controversies, lies somewhere between the two extremes of condemnation and praise. American Dirt is no great work of literature. And although I will defer to others as regards to the cultural inaccuracies of the book, I can say that the writing is only middling.
In one passage, Cummins oddly compares suppressing a scream to smothering a baby: “She fights at every moment against the scream that pulses inside her like a living thing. It stretches and kicks in her gut like Luca did when he was a baby in there. With tremendous self-control, she strangles and suppresses it.”
This is no Grapes of Wrath. But does it deserve to be called racist? While some critics have turned the American Dirt controversy into “who gets to tell whose stories,” others have offered the simpler and more accurate criticism: Cummins is a white woman writing about Hispanic people, and not doing it well.
The worrisome part of the whole controversy then, is not that Cummins has been so harshly criticized for her work, but that the criticism has pivoted from literary critique to the suppression of thoughtcrimes. Just ask Hayek.
When Oprah sent Hayek a copy of her book, she posted a selfie with it on social media, writing: “Now more than ever we need stories of hope & encouragement, endurance & the beauty of the human spirit.” But then the backlash hit, and she was quick to retract her statement.
“I thank all of you who caught me in the act of not doing my research, and for setting me straight,” she wrote the next day, “because that means you know me and gave me the benefit of the doubt; and I apologize for shouting out something without experiencing it or doing research on it.”
Thank you “for setting me straight” is a particularly chilling phrase to hear. Note that all of this occurred before Hayek even had a chance to read the book.
Hayek, just as Cummins, had been convicted in the court of public opinion for having the wrong ideas. While Hayek was forgiven through immediate and abject surrender to the mob, Cummins is still suffering the repercussions.
After several bookstores independently announced that they’d be pulling book events for American Dirt, Flatiron Books announced last week that it would be canceling all further book tours over concerns for Cummins’s safety.
“Jeanine Cummins spent five years of her life writing this book with the intent to shine a spotlight on tragedies facing immigrants,” Bob Miller, president and publisher of Flatiron Books, said in a statement. “We are saddened that a work of fiction that was well-intentioned has led to such vitriolic rancor.”
He cited safety concerns and “specific threats” as reasons for cancellation.
For her part, Cummins has said in interviews that she has barely followed the backlash, and she maintains that she had good intentions. The publishing industry may be overwhelmingly white — just 3% of those in the industry are Hispanic, according to Publisher’s Weekly — but Cummins insists, fairly, that she can’t change who she is.
“I’m a writer, you know?” she said at one of her final book talks. “I don’t feel like I’m responsible for the problem that exists.”
To NPR, Cummins argued that her critics are “attempting to police my identity.”
“All I can do is write the book that I believe in,” she said. “And I did that.”
The American Dirt controversy has exploded thanks to a turbulent mix of identity politics, supposed cultural appropriation, and cancel culture. The novel has been not just critiqued but, as the saying goes, canceled. It is a byword in liberal literary circles, a symbol not for bad writing, but for white privilege and "white saviorism." Cummins’s seven-figure advance and the overly effusive hype surrounding the book’s release certainly didn’t help.
Reviewers ought to critique the book, but when they turn it into an example of racism simply because Cummins is white, they turn literary criticism into a farce.
This type of blackballing has long plagued young adult literature. Last year, an author who was a “sensitivity reader” for other works of literature was accused of insensitivity for making the villain in his novel, set during the Kosovo war, Muslim. The backlash was so vicious that he ended up pulling his own book before it was published.
In the same year, author Amelie Zhao had to delay the publication of her debut novel, Blood Heir, after critics complained that the depiction of slavery in its fictional universe was offensive to African Americans.
If there’s one positive note in the American Dirt controversy, it’s that Cummins has not yet caved to the woke mob, despite its outraged cries.
“This shouldn’t happen again,” warned author Roxanne Gay, predicting what may become a trend in the publishing industry. If a white woman can be so eviscerated for writing about the Latino community, with failed execution but the best of intentions, she’s going to go back to writing about Irish people. And then, she’ll be criticized for not having diverse characters.
American Dirt should never have become a synonym for cultural appropriation, and it’s impressive, though not surprising, how many people have weighed in without actually reading the novel. Now, the controversy is less about the book itself and more about the liberal ideology pushing back against it.
The biggest problem here is not that so many who read the book criticized it, or even that some people read the book and worried whether they could comment on it because of their race. The most chilling aspect of this convoluted controversy is that those who have never touched a copy of American Dirt were so quick to condemn Cummins simply in order to be on the “right” side of the discussion, which is now not a discussion at all.
Cummins knows she has critics, but she has just one wish: “I hope people will read the book before deciding how they feel.”

Jennifer Lopez deserves body affirmation

Texto completo: Imagine that it was the plus-size Lizzo executing the exact same performance in the exact same outfit as Jennifer Lopez at the Super Bowl this year. Would that have been even remotely controversial?
I suspect we wouldn’t be debating whether the body imagery on display was healthy or appropriate.
New York Times columnist Jennifer Weiner wrote Tuesday that she felt “personally judged” as she watched Lopez, at 50 years old, prancing around in a sequined leotard, slithering up and down a dance pole.
“I’m just a few months younger than J. Lo, and, with every birthday, I have asked: Is this the year it ends?” Weiner wrote. “Surely there’s a finish line; a point we’ll reach when the You Must Be This Hot in Order to Participate sign at the amusement park ride disappears, and we all get a seat on the roller coaster (right alongside the lumpy, balding, graying, potbellied men who’ve been riding the entire time).”
She admitted that Lopez looked “amazing,” but that she struggled with feeling self-conscious about her own body, just as many other women did on social media for the same reason.
Weiner concluded that the best thing for women to do would be to view such a performance “like a man.”
Which is to say: “Women watch a 15-minute show featuring elite entertainers and, in some cases, end up feeling bad about ourselves. Men, meanwhile, watch a three-hour game, played by elite athletes with single-digit body fat, and most won’t feel a single twinge of self-doubt, or miss a single chip from the nacho platter.”
Lizzo, who at 31 is much younger than Lopez, wore a fairly similar outfit during her performance at the Grammy Awards. And although I won’t compare the result, I don’t recall anyone declaring to have felt “personally judged” by it or debating whether it was appropriate imagery for children.
The only real difference between the Lizzo and Lopez performances is that, by default, we’re expected to applaud Lizzo's for its "body positivity" politely. The latter? Well, that’s controversial.
If Lizzo deserves to celebrated by everyone, why doesn’t Lopez?
She’s 50 and looks fantastic. No one need feel affronted by it.

Impeachment courses silently through Trump State of the Union appearance

Texto completo: The scars of the recent impeachment battle were on display in a divided Congress, even as President Trump avoided the subject and stuck to an upbeat State of the Union script.
It began with the president appearing to avoid the outstretched hand of Nancy Pelosi and ended with the House leader apparently ripping up a copy of the text. In between, Republicans stood for multiple ovations, while Democrats, with the women in suffragette white, stayed silent.
Through it all, Trump delivered a rosy assessment of his wins so far and laid out the aspirations that he hopes will land him a second term in office.
“America's enemies are on the run, America's fortunes are on the rise, and America's future is blazing bright," he said, swapping his freewheeling campaign persona out for the more conventional role of a president addressing a joint session of Congress. "In just three short years, we have shattered the mentality of American decline and we have rejected the downsizing of America's destiny. We are moving forward at a pace that was unimaginable just a short time ago, and we are never going back!”
Even by the unique yardstick of this presidency, the first days of February offered an extraordinary news cycle and backdrop for Trump to set out the themes he hopes will propel him to a second term.
A new Gallup poll found that 49% of respondents approved of the job Trump is doing in office, beating his previous high by 3 points. In the meantime, the Democrats’ nomination race descended into a farce in Iowa, and, within 24 hours, Trump is all but certain to be acquitted in a Senate impeachment trial.
It made for striking optics as Trump delivered an upbeat message of progress while the speaker of the House looked over his shoulder.
The tension was evident from the start, when Pelosi changed the traditional wording, avoiding describing the “high honor and distinct pleasure” of introducing the 45th president.
But the president resisted the temptation to take the fight to his accusers in Congress. Instead, he followed President Bill Clinton’s example from 1999, when Clinton made no mention of impeachment.
Supporters applauded the discipline on display. Sam Nunberg, who worked on the 2016 Trump campaign, said: “This was a smart move not to complicate the inevitable and perhaps bipartisan acquittal tomorrow.”
But that did not mean there were not partisan attacks. As Trump talked up his work to reduce medical costs, he attacked what he described as plans for the “socialist takeover of our healthcare system” on the Left.
And there was a more coded message directed at supporters of Bernie Sanders, a socialist who is one of the Democratic presidential primary front-runners, as Trump welcomed Juan Guaido, recognized by the U.S. as the president of Venezuela. It afforded an opportunity for Trump to rail against the damage done by the regime of Nicolas Maduro.
“Socialism destroys nations,” he said. “But always remember, freedom unifies the soul.”
As ever, the presidential guests were carefully selected to accent his message. The guests included immigration officers, victims of violent crime, and military families. There was also one moment when Trump displayed his knack for reality TV-style moments, surprising a mother and two children by flying in Sgt. 1st Class Townsend Williams from Afghanistan for an emotional reunion.
But the night will be remembered for the friction on display between the president and Pelosi.
She recently told the New York Times she had not spoken to Trump since October, and, for his part, the president told Fox News on Super Bowl Sunday that he was not optimistic that Democrats would want to work with him.
"I'm not sure that they can do it, to be honest," he said.
As he left the podium, Pelosi could be seen tearing up her advance copy of the speech. The president might not have mentioned impeachment, but its ripples extended all the way through the House chamber.

Texto completo: One of the news networks President Trump loves to call "fake news" is reportedly barred from the annual pre-State of the Union lunch.
Anchors from CNN are will not be allowed into Tuesday's event, sources told the network.
The off-the-record lunch allows anchors to gain access to the president's state of mind hours before the televised address to the nation. This year's State of the Union comes amid a Senate impeachment trial against Trump that has seen partisan division and resentment grow in both chambers of Congress.
CNN's Anderson Cooper and Wolf Blitzer attended the lunch last year. In fact, Blitzer has appeared at every lunch for the past 20 years.
Trump has a fraught relationship with the media giant. For instance, in late 2018 the White House briefly revoked CNN correspondent Jim Acosta's press pass, which had led to a federal lawsuit. More recently, a viral video showed Ivanka Trump, the president's daughter and adviser, brush past Acosta as he attempted to ask about her father's impeachment trial.
Trump will address the nation a day after the Iowa caucuses and a day before a vote in the Senate on his two impeachment articles of abuse and obstruction.

DHS head claims Iowa Democrats refused to let department test failed caucus app

Texto completo: The Democratic Party in Iowa declined an offer from the Department of Homeland Security to vet the app that failed during the state's caucuses on Monday night.
The results from the Iowa caucuses are still unknown after an app used by Democrats to report the election results failed. The party acknowledged that “inconsistencies” in reporting meant that the results would be significantly delayed.
During a Tuesday morning interview on Fox and Friends, acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf said that Iowa Democrats refused when the department’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency offered to test the app to ensure its security.
“[We] had offered to test that app from a hacking perspective. They declined, and so, we're seeing a couple of issues with it. I would say, right now, we don’t see any malicious cyber activity going on,” Wolf said.
He added, “No one hacked into it, so this is more of a stress or a load issue, as well as a reporting issue that we’re seeing in Iowa. But what I would say is that, given the amount of scrutiny that we have on election security these days, this is a concerning event, and it really goes to the public confidence of our elections.”
Wolf’s remarks contradicted a report in the New York Times that the Iowa Democratic Party said the app had been vetted by the department before the caucuses. Iowa Democratic Party Chairman Troy Price also told the Wall Street Journal that he was “confident in the security systems we have in place.”
As for the general elections, Wolf said the department plans to have people in polling places throughout the country, adding, “We are more secure than we've ever been.”

Jennifer Weiner: I feel personally judged by J-Lo’s body

Texto completo: Most mornings, things are pretty chill on my Facebook feed. There’s the ongoing simmering outrage about the current administration interspersed with posts about kids, about books, about yoga. Someone’s posting a pair of dresses and asking her friends to vote; someone’s sharing a video of their child at the high-school talent show. Typical middle-age mom stuff.
But on Monday morning, I woke up to major mom drama. My Facebook community was convulsed in a take-no-prisoners battle, a war being waged on the tanned, taut terrain of Jennifer Lopez’s body. Yes, she shared the bill with the 43-year-old Shakira, but the most intense debate was all about the seven-years-older Jenny from the Block.
In this corner: the women who found J. Lo’s Super Bowl high-energy hit mash-up unnecessarily salacious, designed to titillate male viewers, performed for the male gaze. “Sponsored by Pornhub,” sniffed one. “Trashy,” said another. Why did there have to be a stripper pole, and why couldn’t she have worn more clothes? Call them the Pearl Clutchers.
In the opposing corner: the women who found the show inspiring, a stirring political statement, a demonstration of Puerto Rican pride and also what a woman’s body can do, given the right combination of genetics, effort, discipline and money. Call them the Ass Shakers.
Whether women singing and dancing in barely-there costumes or otherwise celebrating their bodies is empowering, or an assault on our ability to move through the world as men’s equals, is one of those forever fights that flares up whenever sex workers’ rights or pornography are debated or Emily Ratajkowski posts a topless selfie.
What gave this iteration its special sauce, however, was the age of the woman at its center.
If there was one thing the Shakers and the Clutchers could agree on, it’s that Jennifer Lopez looks amazing. At 50, she is a force of nature, a woman who looks so amazing it’s like evolution took a tiny step forward, just for her. “I can’t believe she’s 50 and looks so good!” women said. Which quickly became, “I can’t believe I’m 50 and I look so bad!” (“Aside from making me feel physically deformed, that half-time show was 100!” wrote the Sports Illustrated editor Sarah Kwak.)
Some members of my social-media community were in awe. Others — myself included — were feeling personally judged by dat ass. I’m just a few months younger than J. Lo, and, with every birthday, I have asked: Is this the year it ends? Surely there’s a finish line; a point we’ll reach when the You Must Be This Hot in Order to Participate sign at the amusement park ride disappears, and we all get a seat on the roller coaster (right alongside the lumpy, balding, graying, potbellied men who’ve been riding the entire time).
That’s what I always imagined. But I also thought that pregnancy would be a nine-month time out from competing in the Looking Good Olympics. Alas, I had my daughters in the heyday of the Hot Mom, an era where billowy maternity garments gave way to bump-hugging body-con styles, where celebrities left the hospitals holding their newborns, wearing their skinny jeans. No respite there. Forty was clearly too soon to surrender, given Halle Berry and Jennifer Aniston, Brooke Shields and Lisa Bonet, not to mention those ubiquitous lists of 10 Celebrities Who Are Unrecognizable Today (You Won’t Believe Number 8!) that popped up every time I went online and told me that gaining weight and aging visibly were a fast road to irrelevance and mockery.
Still, I’d been picturing 50 as the year when I’d be done. I’d quit dying my hair and donate my high heels; I’d greet the occasional chin hair with a Buddhist master’s zen and treat my body like a place I could exist without apology instead of something akin to a seedy apartment complex, a place I needed to constantly manage and improve, with unruly bits to be waxed and plucked, painted and dyed, trussed in Spandex and lifted with underwire.
I have always tried to tell myself that celebrity bodies are a little like art galleries. I can appreciate and be inspired by their beauty. I can acknowledge the time and money that went into their creation. When I’ve finished looking, I can go home, secure in the knowledge that nobody expects my living room to look like that.
Then I saw the meme that made the rounds on Monday. “50 Years Old in 1985,” read one side, with a shot of Rue McClanahan from “Golden Girls,” in period-appropriate feathered hair and a dowdy-looking sweater. “50 Years Old in 2020,” read the other side, with Jennifer Lopez in a silver bodysuit, toned thighs gripping the pole, honeyed locks streaming, and bronzed skin gleaming, looking impossibly … impossible. If Blanche Devereaux is now, through some cruel twist of the worst timeline, on the Not side of Hot or Not, I guess Dorothy Zbornak is completely out of the question. And Dorothy had been my plan all along!
The answer, I think, is to watch these types of performances like a man.
Women watch a 15-minute show featuring elite entertainers and, in some cases, end up feeling bad about ourselves.
Men, meanwhile, watch a three-hour game, played by elite athletes with single-digit body fat, and most won’t feel a single twinge of self-doubt , or miss a single chip from the nacho platter.
Women see inspiration or goals we’ve failed to attain or a pretty stick to beat ourselves up with. We hear a voice (sponsored by Weight Watchers and Revlon and Planet Fitness and Jenny Craig) whispering This can be yours, if you just work hard enough. Men see entertainment, athletes who exist on a different plane than mere mortals. Their inner voice whispers, Are there any more nachos? I don’t even think it would occur to them to feel bad, or try to emulate what they saw.
And so, my fellow Gen-X ladies, if you want to be J. Lo, more power to you. If you want to be Blanche, be Blanche. But if it’s always been about Bea Arthur, come sit back here, with me, in your Eileen Fisher tunic and the newish bifocals you haven’t quite mastered. We’ll wait ’til the crowd goes home, and we’ll dance like nobody’s watching.

Texto completo: Is this the week American democracy dies? Quite possibly.
After all, everyone in Washington understands perfectly well that Donald Trump abused the powers of his office in an attempt to rig this year’s presidential election. But Senate Republicans are nonetheless about to acquit him without even pretending to look at the evidence, thereby encouraging further abuses of power.
[ Read More: Trump suggested impeaching Sen. Mitt Romney. Now Romney gets to vote on Trump’s impeachment. ]
But how did we get to this point? Part of the answer is extreme partisanship and right-wing political correctness (which is far more virulent than anything on the left). But I also blame the zombies.
A zombie idea is a belief or doctrine that has repeatedly been proved false, but refuses to die; instead, it just keeps shambling along, eating people’s brains. The ultimate zombie in American politics is the assertion that tax cuts pay for themselves — a claim that has been proved wrong again and again over the past 40 years. But there are other zombies, like climate change denial, that play an almost equally large role in our political discourse.
And all of the really important zombies these days are on the right. Indeed, they have taken over the Republican Party.
It was not always thus. Back in 1980, George H.W. Bush called Ronald Reagan’s extravagant claims about the effectiveness of tax cuts “voodoo economic policy.” Everything that has happened since has vindicated his original assessment. Deficits ballooned after Reagan cut taxes; they shrank and eventually turned into surpluses after Bill Clinton raised taxes, then ballooned again after George W. Bush’s tax cuts.
Voodoo has also crashed and burned at the state level: The Kansas experiment in radical tax cuts was a dismal failure, while California’s tax hike under Jerry Brown, which conservatives declared a case of “economic suicide,” was followed by a revenue and economic boom.
Yet voodoo economics has become unchallengeable doctrine within the Republican Party. Even fake moderates like Susan Collins justified their support for the 2017 Trump tax cut by claiming that it would reduce the budget deficit. Predictably, the deficit actually exploded, and now exceeds $1 trillion a year.
The politics of climate change have followed a similar trajectory. Global temperature keeps setting records, while climate-related catastrophes like the Australian wildfires are proliferating. Yet a majority of Republicans in Congress are climate deniers — many of them buying into the notion that climate change is a hoax perpetrated by a vast international scientific conspiracy — and even those, like Marco Rubio, who grudgingly admit that global warming is real oppose any significant action to limit emissions.
It’s important to realize that the zombification of the GOP isn’t a recent phenomenon, something that happened only with Trump’s election. On the contrary, zombies have been eating Republican brains for decades. Voodoo economics had completely taken over the party by the early 2000s, when then-House majority leader Tom DeLay declared, “Nothing is more important in the face of war than cutting taxes.” Climate deniers have ruled since at least 2009, when only eight House Republicans supported a bill to limit greenhouse gas emissions.
What recent events make clear, however, is that zombie ideas haven’t eaten just Republicans’ brains. They have also eaten the party’s soul.
Think about what is now required for a Republican politician to be considered a party member in good standing. He or she must pledge allegiance to policy doctrines that are demonstrably false; he or she must, in effect, reject the very idea of paying attention to evidence.
It takes a certain kind of person to play that kind of game — namely, a cynical careerist. There used to be Republican politicians who were more than that, but they were mainly holdovers from an earlier era, and at this point have all left the scene, one way or another. John McCain may well have been the last of his kind.
What’s left now is a party that, as far as I can tell, contains no politicians of principle; anyone who does have principles has been driven out.
Now, the news media, with its constant urge to seem “balanced,” has a hard time coping with this reality; it’s always looking for ways to portray at least some Republicans as admirable figures. This has made it easy prey for charlatans like Paul Ryan, who pretended to be serious about his fiscal principles. But he was always an obvious flimflam man.
Anyway, a result of decades of zombification is a Republican caucus that consists entirely of soulless opportunists (and no, the fact that some of them like to quote Scripture doesn’t change that fact).
I guess you might have hoped that there would be some limits to what these apparatchiks would accept, that even they would draw the line at gross abuses of power and collusion with foreign autocrats. What we’ve learned, however — and perhaps more important, what Trump has learned — is that there is no line. If Trump wants to dismantle democracy and rule of law (which he does), his party will stand with him all the way.

Can the Sundance Film Festival stage an Oscar comeback?

Texto completo: For a while there, you could count on Oscar’s best-picture race to leave at least one slot open for a hit from the Sundance Film Festival. Movies like “Manchester by the Sea,” “Brooklyn,” “Call Me by Your Name,” and “Beasts of the Southern Wild” began their long road to awards season at the festival in Park City, while Sundance classics “Boyhood” and “Get Out” came oh-so-close to winning the best-picture trophy outright.
Over the past two years, though, Sundance and the Oscars have been engaged in a bit of a trial separation. No narrative movie coming out of Sundance has been nominated in the six biggest Oscar categories during that time, despite a surplus of strong contenders, including “Eighth Grade,” “First Reformed” and “The Farewell.”
We won’t know until this time next year whether Oscar and Sundance will kiss and make up, but now that the festival’s 2020 edition has concluded, at least some of the hits provide hope of a rapprochement.
Some of those fit a traditional Oscar rubric, like “The Father,” Florian Zeller’s ruthless drama about a father and daughter (played by Academy Award winners Anthony Hopkins and Olivia Colman) who are navigating the older man’s dementia. Hopkins is a marvel: fleet and funny when he needs to be, and tragic when he starts to lose the thread of his life. Expect all involved to be major players this awards season.
Sara Colangelo’s “Worth” recalls a recent best-picture winner: Like “Spotlight,” it’s a fact-based Michael Keaton drama about sensitive issues, this one casting Keaton as Kenneth Feinberg, the attorney tasked with determining the size of a payout for grieving families in the wake of 9/11. Solidly mounted, it also features two key supporting performances from Amy Ryan as Keaton’s concerned colleague and especially Stanley Tucci as a widower leading the opposition to the payout. Whether the film becomes an Oscar contender may depend on which studio picks it up; as of deadline, “Worth” was still waiting for buyers to come to their own dollar figure.

The hip company A24 has had trouble getting its movies into the Oscar race since “Moonlight” and “Lady Bird,” but Sundance still provides a valuable, high-profile starting point for its buzz titles. At Sundance, the studio premiered the moving “Minari,” with Steven Yeun as a Korean dad trying to start a farm in rural Arkansas to his family’s general consternation, as well as the zippy “Zola,” a dark comedy inspired by a Twitter thread about two exotic dancers on the road trip from hell. The latter film, directed by Janicza Bravo, has a strong quartet of performances — newcomer Taylour Paige and the hilarious Riley Keough are the leads, while Colman Domingo and “Succession” scene-stealer Nicholas Braun play troublemakers — and their inclusion would make the next awards season awfully fun.
Though the Oscars continue to catch flak for snubbing female directors, two of the most talked-about movies at Sundance were made by women. “The 40-Year-Old Version,” directed by and starring Radha Blank as a playwright-turned-rapper, won her the festival’s best-director award, while the scorching comedy “Promising Young Woman,” from writer-director Emerald Fennell, stars Carey Mulligan as an avenging angel with an unconventional method for bringing down men who commit sexual assault. Mulligan hasn’t been Oscar-nominated since her star-making role 10 years ago in “An Education,” but here, she delivers on all that promise and then some.
Beyond all the narrative films, Sundance always provides a robust documentary lineup, and it’s in that category where the festival may have its best shot at catching Oscar’s attention: Already, “Crip Camp” and “Boys State” were singled out for awards at the fest’s closing night. “Crip Camp,” about a New York summer camp that becomes a formative experience for disabled activists, was produced by Barack and Michelle Obama (who also lent their muscle to this year’s best-documentary nominee “American Factory”), while “Boys State” is a galvanizing study of teenage boys engaging in a game of mock-governance that soon feels all too real.
You’ll be hearing more about them soon, and with a little luck, so will Oscar.

David Leonhardt: When you’re president, you can do anything

Texto completo: It wasn’t the most notorious part of the “Access Hollywood” tape, but it was the most revealing: “And when you’re a star, they let you do it. You can do anything.”
Donald Trump was talking in 2005 to Billy Bush, then a host of the celebrity-news program “Access Hollywood.” It was hardly a private moment. They were wearing microphones and surrounded by a camera crew. Before their interview began, Trump explained how he liked to “move” on women, kissing them without their permission and grabbing their genitalia.
In the more than three years since the tape emerged, it’s become clear that the you-can-do-anything line wasn’t only describing Trump’s attitude toward women. It was describing his attitude toward everything : If you’re rich, famous or powerful, you can get away with much more than most people understand. You just do it. You don’t need to worry about ethical niceties or even, sometimes, the law. You use your advantages to bulldoze any obstacles.
For anyone trying to make sense of the impeachment trial, this attitude is central. It’s why Trump pressured Ukraine to conduct a smear campaign in the first place: Because he could. And it’s how Trump organized his defense in the Senate. His lawyers offered a brazenly inconsistent series of arguments, from “He did nothing wrong” to “There was no quid prod quo” to “There were no witnesses to the quid pro quo” to, finally, “If a president does it, it’s OK.”
You could almost hear the echo of the “Access Hollywood” tape in the Senate last week: When you’re president, you can do anything.
In that conversation with Bush, Trump was describing his life’s credo. It is amoral, entitled and opportunistic. It has also been remarkably consistent.
Trump first learned this approach from his father and benefactor, Fred. The Trumps didn’t want black people living in their apartment buildings in the 1960s, so they refused to rent apartments to many black people. It was illegal, but the government did not care enough about racism to impose serious punishment.
The Trumps also wanted to be richer than their business was making them. So they committed financial fraud, evading taxes to increase Trump’s inheritance from his father. Again, they got away with it.
After Donald Trump took over the business, he stiffed workers, contractors and lenders. He claimed to be wealthier than he was. He cheated on his wives and, according to more than a dozen different women, committed sexual assault. With his casino business close to collapse, he used his celebrity to reinvent himself on reality television. When you’re a star, they let you do it.
Trump next brought this approach to politics. It explains the constant lying, the insults and bigotry, the threats of violence and prosecution and the cozying up to foreign enemies. It also explains his perceptive claim that he could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue and not get in trouble. Trump does what he thinks is best for him, often in open defiance of rules or customs that constrain almost everybody else.
The impeachment trial has been a case study. No American president before Trump would have dared to collaborate openly with foreign countries for partisan advantage. Trump has done so repeatedly, starting in the summer of 2016 with Russia and then with China, Ukraine and perhaps unknown others. He had the ability to do it, so he did it.
Obviously, Trump’s credo is only half the impeachment story, because the Senate is supposed to be an independently powerful body, not a political servant to the White House. Yet Trump has understood, consciously or otherwise, that the Senate isn’t what it used to be. It is controlled today by the Republican Party, and that party has changed.
For much of American history, Congress would have reined in a reckless president, even if he were in the same party as congressional leaders. Congress certainly would have insisted on hearing from impeachment witnesses with crucial information. Every single Senate impeachment trial before the current one — all 15, for lower-level officials as well as both Presidents Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton — included witnesses.
But the current Republican Party cares more about holding on to power than anything else. In service of this goal, the party has even fought democracy, be it preventing American citizens from voting, changing the rules for Supreme Court nominations, stripping authority from incoming governors or running an impeachment trial unconcerned with facts.
Why has the Republican Party changed? Political scientist Theda Skocpol offers a useful two-part explanation in a new book, “Upending American Politics.” First, the sharp rise of inequality has empowered conservative donors and activists who want to protect their fortunes by shrinking government. Second, many rank-and-file voters have grown angry about economic stagnation and anxious about immigration and secularization. These voters have become attracted to, or at least tolerant of, a politics tinged with ethno-nationalism and authoritarianism.
The country is left with a president who has spent decades doing whatever he thinks is in his self-interest — and a political party willing to protect that president. Staying in power trumps all.
That, of course, is the ideology of autocracy. And although the United States is not an autocracy, our country is taking steps in that direction that I never imagined we would.

Texto completo: Is Iowa a metaphor? A harbinger?
Either way it’s a mess — and not the way any Democrat wanted the party’s voting to begin in an election year with stratospheric stakes.
To excite the most Americans possible and have its best chance of toppling President Donald Trump, the Democratic Party needs a sorting of candidates that’s coherent, a system that inspires faith, a process that makes participants feel respected and heard.
Iowa provided none of that Monday night. Instead it staged a baffling spectacle resistant to any timely, definitive verdict. More than 12 hours after the actual, physical caucusing at hundreds of locations across the state had finished, there were still no official results, just resentments, recriminations and reports that a newly intricate manner of counting had proven laborious, a newly developed app for it hadn’t worked as planned, a backup phone line had jammed, and the campaigns had been asked to join a pair of emergency conference calls with state Democratic officials.
Maybe there’s a moral here about dreaming too big and reaching too high. Maybe there’s just a terrifying repeat of the party’s awful luck in 2016.
The candidates were stunned. Their aides were livid. And Democrats nationwide, so hungry for the first signs of resolution in a primary with so many competitive candidates, waited and waited late into the night Monday, and surely, in most cases, gave up and went to bed. Not me. I was too aghast, agitated and curious to see how soon Trump and his enablers would exploit this turn of events.
The inevitable answer: right away. Brad Parscale, the president’s campaign manager, sent a tweet out before midnight Monday Eastern time.
“Democrat party meltdown,” he wrote. “They can’t even run a caucus and they want to run the government. No thank you.”
Lovely — and not the last of it. Trump quickly amplified the gloating and taunting, which, after golf, are his favorite sports. On Tuesday morning he tweeted: “The Democrat Caucus is an unmitigated disaster. Nothing works, just like they ran the Country.” Donald Trump Jr. used his own Twitter account to spread a conspiracy theory about a fraudulent outcome and sniped that “there’s no question anymore that the greatest threat to US Elections is in fact Democrat incompetence.”
The Trumps, Parscale and the rest of their wretched gang will fold what happened in Iowa into their persistent narrative: Democrats are hapless, and the traditions and institutions that Americans are asked to trust don’t deserve that deference.
Iowa is a prompt for cynicism. Cynicism is President Trump’s lifeblood.
As predictable as Parscale’s tweet were formal complaints about the credibility of the vote count from Democrats worried about their showing in the caucuses. One came from Joe Biden’s campaign, which argued that “considerable flaws” should be examined and addressed before any results were accepted.
And so the victor in Iowa may be denied his or her full measure of credit and exultation, the losers may be spared some of the usual damage, and one or more of the candidates and his or her supporters may question the fairness and legitimacy of how the entire Democratic primary plays out. It’s 2016 all over again. Wasn’t the party supposed to learn from its mistakes?
There’s no excuse for this, not given how long the Iowa Democratic Party had to prepare, not given the privilege of the state’s first-in-the-nation status, not given how deeply invested tens of millions of distraught Americans are in the effort to get rid of an unfit, amoral president. That effort can’t start like this.
The debacle was a specific betrayal of Iowa’s voters. I spent most of the past week in Iowa, where I was wowed and moved by how much thought Iowans were putting into which candidate they’d caucus for. They made clear that they saw Trump as an existential threat. So they weren’t merely deciding on a favorite candidate. They were anointing a savior and anxiously unsure about who represented the surest and best hope.
I’d never seen voters so twisted into knots. I’d never seen pundits so perplexed by the tea leaves in front of them and so hesitant to play fortuneteller. I’d never been so stymied for insight, so barren of instinct. This wasn’t a political contest; it was a kidney stone.
And by late Tuesday morning, it still hadn’t passed.
The candidates, too, were betrayed, cruelly and destructively so. They tried to work around the crazy ambiguity, delivering remarks to their supporters that neither declared victory nor conceded defeat, because no one was yet victorious and no one yet defeated — not officially.
“Somehow, some way, I’m going to get on a plane tonight to New Hampshire,” Amy Klobuchar told the crowd at her election-night party, and that “somehow, some way” was a nod to the surreal limbo in which the candidates languished.
“We’re going to walk out of here with our share of delegates,” Biden told the crowd at his election-night party. It was a safe statement because it was an utterly and necessarily vacuous one.
Bernie Sanders matched it: “I have a strong feeling that at some point, the results will be announced.”
As the hours ticked by, the Iowa Democratic Party released a statement saying that the delay was attributable to their diligence in resolving inconsistencies and that there was “not a hack or an intrusion” that should stoke doubts about the eventual vote tally.
But doubts had already been stoked. They’ll probably never go fully away. And in an era when “rigged” and “hoax” are the actual mantras of the American president, they’re devastating. They’re unaffordable.
Pete Buttigieg spoke later than other candidates and seemed to have information that convinced him that he’d finished at or near the top.
“An improbable hope became an undeniable reality,” he said, referring to the long odds against a 38-year-old, openly gay man rising this high in the Democratic primary. He gave a shoutout to “the love of my life,” his husband, Chasten.
That moment was historic. But would it be remembered instead as premature and overconfident? Thanks, Iowa, for the clarity on that. Way to get the ball rolling.

Texto completo: Des Moines, Iowa • I’ve heard Joe Biden speak twice in Iowa over recent days. Both times, I walked away barely able to remember a single issue he mentioned. I had to check my notes. Ah, yes, guns: He touched on that. Climate change, too. That flitted by.
But Biden’s closing argument in Iowa, whose caucuses Monday night provide the first meaningful measure of the traction that the various Democratic candidates have found, doesn’t hinge on any of those. That’s because his bid for his party’s presidential nomination doesn’t, either. Maybe more than any campaign I’ve observed over the past quarter century, it’s about character — his and the country’s.
It’s about honesty, decency, empathy, humanity . For reasons we’ll be plumbing for many years to come, America in 2016 elected a president bereft of those traits, and the country ever since has been in a moral free fall. So Biden is waging a “battle for the soul of the nation.” It says so in big letters on the side of the bus that has been carrying him through this state. He’s running to reconnect America with the best of itself.
At a crowded, spirited rally here in Des Moines late Sunday afternoon, he recited and railed against examples of Donald Trump’s cruelty, his voice thick with disgust.
Speaking to hundreds of voters in Waukee, Iowa, on Thursday morning, he asked: “Does it matter if a president has no moral compass?” It was a rhetorical question and the core of his message.
It was also powerful, much more so than I expected.
In debates and television interviews since he formally entered the race for the Democratic nomination last April, Biden, 77, has been unimpressive, his energy palpably diminished, his sentences wobbling toward some destination other than the initially intended one.
On the stump, though, he has vigor. He has something else, too: an aura of overarching goodness that’s a tonic in the context of Donald Trump. I found myself quaffing it greedily, parched from the past few weeks, when Trump’s Senate trial confirmed how unbound the president is and how completely Republican lawmakers have surrendered their integrity to him.
Will Iowans find Biden as consoling as I do? Can “consoling” drive people to the polls?
Recent voter surveys give the edge in the caucuses to Bernie Sanders, who also leads in New Hampshire, could wind up winning the first two Democratic contests and has a profoundly different vibe. He’s about fighting fire with fire. Biden is about dousing the flames with compassion. And for many voters, that’s “a nostalgia act whose well-worn slogans about middle-class uplift and national unity are out of sync in this season of outrage,” as Molly Ball wrote in Time magazine last week. Biden was on the cover.
As I pinged around Iowa and heard speeches by all four leading candidates (Sanders, Biden, Elizabeth Warren and Pete Buttigieg), I realized that there are three R’s of this Democratic primary.
There’s revolution, which is what Sanders expressly urges — “revolution” is his mantra — and which Warren less bluntly promotes, calling for “big structural change” and vowing to “take our government back.”
There’s rejuvenation: Buttigieg, 38, leans on the fact that his three main rivals are all 70 or older to stress the importance of a fresh set of eyes and the need to give a new generation of politicians a chance.
And there’s restoration. That’s Biden, the country’s vice president from January 2009 to January 2017. He weaves many references to President Barack Obama into his remarks, mentioning “ our administration,” and in a 60-second video that he shows at the start of his events, Obama’s face appears before his does and pops up another two times.
What Biden is promising, though, isn’t so much a return of personnel or policies as of propriety. He wants to make America normal again. He told the Waukee crowd that in Trump’s world, “Up is down, lies are the truth, allies are enemies. Everything is through the looking glass.” He’s going to rescue us from that wicked wonderland. And he’s going to do it by being a really nice guy.
Let Sanders go point by point through the virtues of “Medicare for All.” Let Warren illuminate the intricacies of her anti-corruption plan. Biden is fuzzier and gooier than that — by design. You’re supposed to leave a Sanders or Warren rally suffused with righteous anger. You leave a Biden rally sort of misty and choked up.
His event in Waukee was arguably most memorable for remarks by Tom Vilsack, the former governor of Iowa, and his wife, Christie, about how loving and supportive Biden had been to their family three years ago, when their 6-year-old granddaughter died. Biden, they said, knows about loss, having buried two of his own children, along with his first wife. It has humbled him. Seasoned him. He senses sorrow and does what he can to soothe it.
They made him sound like an angel and maybe I’m also making him sound that way. He’s not. His record as a senator for almost four decades is full of questionable judgment calls, messy compromises, expedient affiliations. There’s gunk there, if not in the places where Trump insisted it was.
But there’s also enough merit for him to make his curious and curiously compelling pitch. It’s a mature pitch, too, implicitly acknowledging that none of the grand plans that the Democratic candidates describe are likely to be enacted as is. What voters should choose, then, is someone with values and a temperament they trust.
That’s Nancy Bobo’s thinking. Bobo, 67, showed up to hear Biden in Waukee and said that she’d caucus for him Monday night. “Trump has empowered people to be hateful,” she told me, adding that the answer to that is a leader who’s “decent, kind and loving.” Biden checks those boxes for her. Biden makes her feel good about things.
Does that make him the Democrat most likely to beat Trump, which matters so much more than anything else? Got me. We’re all just lobbing guesses, crossing our fingers and holding our breath.
But I do think that the potency of Biden’s appeal as the smile to Trump’s scowl, the calm to his storm and the rectitude to his dissoluteness may be underrated.
Trump has a cameo in that 60-second video, which shows him in mid-scream. It ends with an image of the Oval Office and these words: “Character matters — maybe here more than anywhere.” Every Democratic candidate would agree with that. Only Biden is putting all of his chips there.

DEMS WARN OF 2020 ELECTION INTERFERENCE CONCERNS ARISE AS LIKELY ACQUITTAL LOOMS

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - Speaking before senators who already had made up their minds, House Democrats on Monday warned of election interference in the 2020 presidential contest and that congressional investigations could continue after President Donald Trump's likely acquittal in the third impeachment trial in U.S. history.
The six House Democrats arguing the case against Mr. Trump came back to the Senate floor after failing to convince the majority of senators to call witnesses in the impeachment trial. The Senate last week voted 51-49 to reject efforts to subpoena witnesses and documents, effectively ending the trial.
With the Republican-controlled chamber ready to acquit Mr. Trump on Wednesday, the Democrats tailored their closing arguments to the implications of leaving the president in office.
"President Trump remains a clear and present danger," Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., told the senators. "He is decimating our global standing as a beacon of democracy while corrupting our free and fair elections here at home."
House Democrats accused Mr. Trump of abusing his power by freezing nearly $400 million in military aid to Ukraine and delaying a White House meeting with its new president to extort the American ally into helping his prospects in this November's election.
Mr. Trump, the Democrats asserted, demanded Ukraine announce a probe into a Ukrainian energy firm, Burisma, on whose board sat Hunter Biden, son of former Vice President Joe Biden. In December, the House impeached Mr. Trump on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.
On Monday, Mr. Jeffries suggested the 2020 presidential election could be in doubt if the Senate were to leave Mr. Trump in office.
"Absent conviction and removal, how can we be assured that this president will not do it again?" Mr. Jeffries asked.
"If we are to rely on the next election to judge the president's efforts to cheat in that election, how can we know that the election will be free and fair? How can we know that every vote will be free from foreign influence, solicited by the president himself?"
Sen. Joe Manchin, a moderate Democrat from West Virginia, proposed a different resolution, asking his colleagues to consider censuring Mr. Trump, a less severe outcome than removal from office.
"What the president did was wrong," Mr. Manchin said in a speech on the Senate floor.
White House lawyers have argued Mr. Trump did nothing wrong and lobbed their own accusations of election interference. They portrayed the impeachment inquiry as a rushed, politically motivated exercise that arose from policy disagreements rather than the "high crimes and misdemeanors" set out in the Constitution.
"This is an effort to overturn the result of one election and to try to interfere in the coming election, which begins today in Iowa," White House Counsel Pat A. Cipollone said Monday.
Jay Sekulow, another attorney for Mr. Trump, played a compilation of video clips showing congressional Democrats talking about their desire to impeach Mr. Trump well before the inquiry began last September.
"There's nothing in the charges that could permit the removal of a duly elected president," he said.
Friday's vote to reject witnesses came after pleas from Democrats to call John Bolton, Mr. Trump's former national security adviser.
Mr. Bolton's upcoming book, called "The Room Where It Happened: A White House Memoir," reportedly details direct conversations with Mr. Trump about the freeze in military aid to Ukraine.
The New York Times reported Friday that an Oval Office conversation occurred in early May and was attended by Mr. Cipollone, who is leading Mr. Trump's defense in the impeachment trial.
On Monday, Mr. Jeffries hinted that there could be further action by House Democrats to pursue the full picture of what happened.
"Whatever the outcome in this trial, we will remain vigilant in the House," he said. "There are dedicated public servants who know the difference between right and wrong."
Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., named the nearly two dozen staff members who helped assemble the House impeachment inquiry. Mr. Schiff, chair of the House Intelligence Committee and leader of the prosecution, portrayed them as dedicated, nonpartisan public servants who have been subjected to "vicious false attacks" for their involvement in the inquiry.
The House staff are "brilliant, hardworking and patriotic, and they deserve better than the attacks they have been forced to suffer," Mr. Schiff said.
Mr. Schiff, in giving the last of the closing remarks, seemed to speak directly to moderate Republicans who swung against voting for witnesses. One of those senators, Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., acknowledged the House had proven its case but believed Mr. Trump's actions did not rise to the level of impeachable crimes.
History will not be kind to Mr. Trump, Mr. Schiff said, and senators should consider their vote as a consequential link to the president.
"If you find that the House has proved its case and still vote to acquit, your name will be tied to his with a cord of steel and for all of history," Mr. Schiff said.
"But if you find the courage to stand up to him, to speak the awful truth to his rank falsehood, your place will be among the Davids who took on Goliath," he said.
He went on, "Every single vote - even a single vote by a single member - can change the course of history. . Is there one among you who will say: 'Enough?' "
The House Democrats used about the full two hours allotted to each side, while the White House used about an hour.
The Senate adjourned and will reconvene to vote on the verdict at 4 p.m. Wednesday.

Health officials battle misinformation, concerns in virus outbreak

Texto completo: The World Health Organization chief has traveled a dozen times to monitor the Ebola response in Congo. But when he planned to visit China’s capital last week over a new viral outbreak emerging from central Hubei province, his daughter got worried.
“Before I left for Beijing, my daughter was saying, ‘Oh, you should not go,’” WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus confided to the U.N. health agency’s executive board in a public session on Monday.
The account exemplifies the fine line health officials are navigating between fear about the new coronavirus and hopes of increasing preparedness over an outbreak that has taken more than 360 lives and infected at least 17,238 people in China since late December — and could become a pandemic.
On Sunday, state and local health officials said two Miami University students tested negative for the deadly coronavirus and added their are no other cases in Ohio.
Even though the two Miami University students tested negative, a state health official said she understands “there’s still a lot of concern” in the Oxford community and around the country.
“What we are doing in Ohio is working,” said Dr. Amy Acton, Ohio Department of Health director.
ODH received results of the three-part test — a blood draw, a nasal swab and a mucus sample — from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta on Sunday afternoon, Acton said. A few hours later, a mass communication went out to the Oxford campus.
Acton called the two students, who had traveled to China and presented flu-like symptoms on Jan. 27, the first day of classes, “victims of circumstances,” and they were released from isolation in their residence on Sunday.
“They are thrilled,” Acton said of the students the university has declined to identify, except to say they traveled to China during Miami’s six-week break between semesters.
Jennifer Bailer, Butler County Health Department commissioner, said she had been “hoping and praying” for negative results. She said the public health agencies benefited from the students’ prompt actions when they reported their illness to Student Health Services.
“They did everything right,” she said. “The system worked.”
The students have been cleared to “conduct normal activities,” Bailer said.
Some Miami students who were in China have not yet completed the 14-day incubation period and are being self-monitored.
Despite the negative test results, Miami University has restricted university-sponsored travel to China for all faculty, staff and students for several weeks. Three summer China programs this year have also been redirected, one Miami student studying abroad in China has returned to the Oxford campus and another student who planned to study in China this semester is staying in Oxford, officials said.
Area hospitals have started asking patients showing flu-like symptoms about their recent travel history, and airlines are restricting flights into China, where the first case of coronavirus was confirmed in December.
Only a handful of American airports are permitted to receive flights from China. The scenes were described as confusing on Monday as the first federally mandated quarantine in more than a half-century took effect.
China’s Health Commission reported on Sunday that there were 475 recoveries and 361 deaths nationwide, according to the New York Times. A total of 349 people died in mainland China.
Acton said the novel disease is evolving and changing “hour by hour.”
Melanie Amato, ODH press secretary, said the coronavirus scare in Oxford was “a great example” on how partnership works between the state, the Hamilton and Middletown city health departments and the communities.
“Ohio will remain prepared and we will continue to closely monitor the situation in conjunction with CDC and are ready to respond if necessary,” she said.
Health and university officials have urged the public to show compassion toward international students. Acton said there was “a huge need” for empathy.
Miami has 17,327 undergraduate and 2,607 graduate students on its Oxford campus. Students from China are the university’s largest population of international students with 2,334 enrolled.
About a dozen Miami University Regional campus students in Hamilton and Middletown list their home residence near the area in Wuhan City where the outbreak began in December, according to school officials. Miami officials said Chinese students on both of those campuses have been checked and no issues have been reported.

It doesn’t matter whether the impeachment trial of President Trump is already over or it drags on for months.
Two-thirds of the U.S. Senate is never going to find the president guilty of the House Democrats’ vague and bogus charges of abuse of power and obstructing Congress.
Everyone’s always known that’s how it will end, even the deranged Democrats.
But Adam Schiff and his supporting cast still wasted several days of the country’s time in the Senate this past week declaring over and over that President Trump must be removed from office.
Among other hysterical things, they charged Trump is a threat to our national security, an archenemy of the Constitution and a corrupt dictator who intends to steal the 2020 election.
Democrats have proved for the last three years now that they can spot a new impeachable crime in every other presidential tweet or executive order.
But as Jay Sekulow of the Trump defense team warned the Senate on Tuesday, in their rage to take down Trump the House Democrats have made a serious mistake.
By drastically lowering the bar of impeachment, he said, Democrats have put the constitutional framework of our republic in “unimaginable” danger.
Sekulow also said he thought the impeachment of President Trump is not based on whether or not he exceeded his constitutional authority but is actually a political fight over “deep policy concerns” and “deep policy differences.”
There’s nothing new about wide policy differences between Congress and the White House and between the White House and the State Department.
One reason for that is because members of Congress and the employees of the State Department usually serve for 20 or 30 years while a president lasts eight years at most.
When a new president comes into office with his new policies — getting tough with the Soviets, expanding government health care, putting tougher economic sanctions on Iran — he often meets resistance from veteran congressmen and career bureaucrats in the state department who have their own long-held policy positions.
We saw exactly that kind of White House-State Department tension on display during the House impeachment hearings into President Trump’s Ukraine policy.
The hard anti-corruption policy the president wanted to pursue in Ukraine was criticized, resisted or subverted by state department officials who had been hired by previous presidents.
Making policy is a complicated process for any president. It’s like making sausage. It’s messy, has lots of ingredients and not pretty to watch being made.
It’s the piece of sausage — Obama’s Iran policy, for example, or Trump’s Ukraine policy — that counts in the end.
When my father had to make important decisions on national security and foreign policy matters he would have the National Security Council write up three different versions of what he could do.
The NSC — which is made up of the vice president, cabinet officials, military leaders and other top advisers — and my father would discuss all three options. Then my father would make his decision and the policy would go forward.
No one at The New York Times ever saw those other policy choices and the arguments that went on in those NSC meetings were never leaked to the media.
If transcripts of those meetings had fallen into the hands of today’s deranged Democrats, Adam Schiff would have impeached my father because he didn’t accept one of the other two choices.
If we start impeaching presidents just because we don’t agree with their policies we’re never going to have another one who can get anything done.

Texto completo: When a Chinese exchange student developed symptoms suggestive of the coronavirus that emerged in December in his native country, Philadelphia's William Penn Charter School did the right thing. It worked with health officials to test and quarantine the teenager.
But reaction to the suspected case turned the esteemed Quaker school - dedicated to principles of "mutual respect, equality, community" - into a microcosm of the growing global panic over the new upper respiratory illness.
Penn Charter students stayed home in droves. Local schools canceled athletic events with Penn Charter teams. A school bus driver tried to deny rides to Penn Charter, while a medical professional canceled an appointment with a student. The 18 Chinese exchange students, meanwhile, felt like outcasts.
"This is not the experience we wanted for them," Penn Charter head Darryl J. Ford wrote in a Jan. 27 email informing parents that the tested student did not have the coronavirus - but the exchange program was being axed anyway.
For social scientists, the latest overreaction is dja vu. The 2002 outbreak of SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) in China tapped into anxieties about globalization, immigration, economic disruption, national security, bioterrorism, and more. Now, digital and social media make the fear and loathing even worse.
"The saturation of a 24/7 news media creates the effect of an impending apocalypse," said Duke University English professor Priscilla Wald, author of the book Contagious: Cultures, Carriers, and the Outbreak Narrative. "The threat of a pandemic should not inspire paralysis. It should be a reminder that access to health care should be a basic human right and a priority."
The World Health Organization on Sunday decried the "massive infodemic" that has bombarded people with information, "some accurate and some not."
The psychology of pandemics - epidemics that circle the planet - has always been a product and shaper of cultural angst.
Consider that the global scourge known as the seasonal flu kills between 12,000 and 60,000 people every year in the United States, according to federal data. In a bad year, 40 million Americans are infected. Yet most Americans don't bother to get a flu shot.
Meanwhile, the official coronavirus toll globally hovered near 15,000 cases on Sunday - only 146 outside China. There have been 304 deaths, all in China save for one in the Philippines. The U.S. has 11 confirmed cases, none in the Philadelphia area, where stores are nonetheless running out of face masks. (Experts say ordinary surgical masks are not very helpful.)
"The flu is something we've had around; more is known about the flu," said Carole Kenner, dean of the College of New Jersey's School of Nursing, explaining the seemingly illogical behavior. "It's partly the fear of the unknown."
To be sure, the unknowns are unnerving. A cluster of coronavirus cases in Germany suggests the infection can occasionally be spread during the incubation period - up to two weeks - even before symptoms appear. China's drastic quarantine and travel restrictions may not snuff out the disease. And developing a vaccine could take more than a year.
Then again, the new virus seems to be much like the flu: moderately contagious, often so mild that people don't get a formal diagnosis, and hardest on the elderly and infirm. The mortality rate is well below 1%, based on a study in the Lancet that estimated the true number of coronavirus infections, including mild ones, at about 75,000 late last month.
Before modern medicine and infection control, pandemics were truly devastating. Bubonic plague, which decimated medieval populations in Europe and Asia, upended international trade, the labor supply, feudal control of peasants, faith in God, and the church's power. A century ago, an especially virulent strain of influenza killed millions across the globe, including 20,000 just in Philadelphia.
These days, it's the fear of pandemics that's truly devastating. Many governments, companies, and airlines have restricted travel and trade with China - even though the WHO says that it's unnecessary. Chinese stocks plunged 8% on Monday, the worst day in years, as the country's markets reopened after an extended holiday break.
In Italy, a cruise ship quarantined thousands of tourists for a day last week until a Chinese passenger with a fever tested negative for the virus.
"This virus thing is becoming a psychosis," an Italian citizen told the New York Times while she waited to board the ship.
Fear often goes hand in hand with persecution and prejudice. The Nazis isolated Jews in ghettos on the pretense that they carried diseases. When syphilis first broke out in Europe in the 1400s, the English and Italians called it the French disease; the French called it the disease of Naples; Poles called it the German disease; Russians called it the Polish disease; and so on.
Now, Chinese nationals are feeling the stink eye. Sam Phan, a master's student at the University of Manchester, wrote in the British newspaper the Guardian: "This week, my ethnicity has made me feel like I was part of a threatening and diseased mass. To see me as someone who carries the virus just because of my race is, well, just racist."
Harvey Rubin, a University of Pennsylvania infectious disease specialist who has helped to review Philadelphia's pandemic preparedness, was unsurprised by the panic. "People use any excuse," he said, "to confirm their own robustly held biases and bigotry."

U.S. Bank reviews rules that led to firing

Texto completo: U.S. Bancorp will review rules that led to the firing of two employees who helped a customer outside normal channels just before Christmas, Chief Executive Andy Cecere told employees on Monday.
The move came after a New York Times columnist over the weekend published a column sharply criticizing the bank's actions and calling the episode one way "to understand how some companies have lost their souls."
The employees, who worked at a U.S. Bank call center in Portland, Ore., helped a customer on Dec. 24 who couldn't get cash because his paycheck from a new employer was held up in a verification process that wouldn't be resolved until after the holiday.
One of the employees drove to a gas station from where the customer was calling and gave him $20 in cash. That action violated a company policy that seeks to limit customer contact to branches and offices, and the two employees were fired on New Year's Eve.
While the firings made news in Oregon and went viral on social media, the column by the Times' Nicholas Kristof put a bigger spotlight on them and elevated the situation to the highest levels of the Minneapolis-based company. After the Times posted the column on Saturday, Cecere called Kristof, who attached a note to the column about the conversation and quoted Cecere as saying, "This is not who we are."
In a statement published on the company's website,
Cecere said: "It is important to acknowledge our mistakes and when we fall short of our own high expectations. I take full responsibility."
He added that the company "will also conduct an immediate review of our policies and make appropriate changes to them that align with our values and our commitment to both customers and employees."
Cecere said he spoke to both of the fired employees and said he would work with them and other executives "to understand how we can do better." It wasn't clear whether the fired employees would be offered their old jobs.
U.S. Bank for several years has touted a rating by the Ethisphere Institute, a business that aims to quantify business ethics and review corporate adherence to them, as one of the world's most ethical companies.
But the situation in Oregon showed how the firm's adherence to rules could conflict with both its customer-service goals and employees' desire to help someone who was caught in a situation beyond their control.
In the column, Kristof said he found the company's explanations for the firings to be "incoherent" and "mean-spirited." He added, "When young Americans say in polls that they react more positively to 'socialism' than to 'capitalism,' it's because of the hypocrisy of institutions like U.S. Bank."
After a reader posted a comment to his column pointing out that many people encounter times in life when they are required to "go above and beyond," Kristof replied that common sense must prevail.
"Look, I understand why companies put holds on checks so that they reduce the risk of fraud losses. I understand why they have policies banning call center employees from meeting customers," Kristof wrote. "But companies also need a bit of common sense, a bit of heart."

Notes on a train wreck

Texto completo: Hi, Yvonne here. You may remember me from such past panic attacks as “The president is destroying our democracy," “America will never elect a woman president," and “The planet is, like, literally on fire."
Today, I bring you “AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!!!!"
What else can one say at this point, given the high-speed yet somehow also slow-motion train wreck that is absolutely everything?
We could talk about the ever-more terrifying coronavirus, or the hijacked impeachment trial, or the Sox actually talking of trading our matchless Mookie away. But let's start with something we all hoped would be behind us by now, but which continues to pursue us like some deathless, landlocked, corn-fed kraken.
It's the good ol' Iowa Caucus, of course, that magnificent quadrennial political tradition to which the whole nation turns for a heart-warming, political tableau and a little direction each presidential cycle. We all wait breathlessly as a tiny sliver of folks in Real America — not to be confused with Actual America — gather in high school gymnasiums to hand down their wisdom as to who should lead us, before our fancies move on to more meaningful contests, like the one right across the border to our north.
But not this year. “Worried about the democratic process and freaked out by the chaos that surrounds you?" Iowa is saying. “Hold our beer. We will give you a God's honest, industrial strength debacle that will start this terrifying presidential campaign off right. Howzabout no election results at all?"
New vote-counting rules and a new precinct reporting app have left us waiting for the much-anticipated, soon-to-be-irrelevant tallies for nearly a day so far. How does this happen in a contest with like, 11 voters? And if it happens there, what the heck can we expect in more unwieldy contests down the line?
And into the numberless void, a couple of candidates stepped, declaring victory (looking at you, mayor Pete Buttigieg!) without an official vote tally of any kind. Way to exploit a crisis!
Also joining this sad-sack parade: baseless allegations and wild conspiracy theories. Because that's what we do now that facts are dead. Rather than just a monumental screw-up, the Iowa debacle is now some scheme, hatched by the DNC or Hillary Clinton or Buttigieg to hide the truth that former vice president Joe Biden tanked in Iowa, and Vermont's Bernie Sanders ran away with it.
Or so say the Twitter sages, including devoted Bernie fans and, interestingly, some prominent Trump cultists, who have been pumping up Sanders for a while now. “What are the odds [the voting system crash] has nothing to do with a Bernie blowout and Biden crash?" Tweeted Senator Lindsey Graham, the Soulless Sycophant of South Carolina.

(By the by, I'm sure there's a perfectly innocent explanation for the fact that Trump and his enablers seem so desperate for Sanders to win the nomination. Carry on!)
Want to shake voters' faith in democracy, thereby depressing turnout? Russian disinformation is so 2016. This time, the call is coming from inside the house. Goosed by a GOP that can't win without cheating, with an assist from serious incompetence in the Hawkeye State, that faith took another hit Monday night.
Elsewhere in America, things are going from worse to worse-er.
As the crisis continued in Iowa, Republicans in Washington kept hurtling down the path of no return, preparing to acquit the president of transgressions to which he openly admitted, liberating him to double down on attempts to cheat in the 2020 election because who the heck is going to stop him? For the few senators left possessed of a modicum of shame, this involved twisting themselves into elaborate, uncomfortable looking knots, as Alaska's Lisa Murkowski did Monday, or desperately attempting to deflect attention, like Kentucky's Rand Paul, who is absolutely desperate to publicly name the whistle-blower he and his colleagues claim is the real traitor here.
Meanwhile, even before a formal impeachment vote is taken, Trump has reportedly made an enemies list and is threatening to criminally prosecute those who dared inform the public that he used taxpayer money to extort a vulnerable foreign country to help in cheat in the election.
LOL, nothing matters!
And the behavior of the guy the GOP is glued to grows more bizarre by the day. The president of the United States thinks the Super Bowl-winning football team from Kansas City hail from “The Great State of Kansas."
And video from the Trump's own Super Bowl party in Florida shows him behaving very oddly indeed during the singing of the national anthem, swaying and pointing and pretending to conduct the music. The president who said those who don't stand proudly for the national anthem maybe “shouldn't be in the country" looks for all the world like some antsy 3-year old in need of a potty break, while everyone around him stands stock-still, hands on hearts.
But at least he isn't a Black player who takes a knee, right? That would be really bad. Anyway, speaking of train wrecks, Tuesday night's State of the Union address is going to be a treat, according to Trump spokesman Hogan Gidley, who totally does not talk like somebody who desperately needs deprogramming.
“The president is a best-selling author and deeply gifted orator who packs arenas and has a meticulous and carefully honed method for writing his speeches," Gidley said.
Ah yes, Trump is a regular Cicero. Have you heard his meticulous and carefully honed orations on low-flow toilets? Surely his State of the Union address will be a paragon of restraint and dignity, a unifying performance that will restore our faith in in our shaken democracy (thanks again, Iowa!).
Yeah, nah.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!

Texto completo: If you've waded into the jungle of online dating, chances are you've been exposed to a graphic image that you never wanted to see – especially if you're a young woman.
Over half of women ages 18 to 29 have received an explicit image they never asked for, according to a 2017 Pew Research Center study. Among all women, 32% have, while 30% of men have.
It's so widespread a problem that one internet user, Kelsey Bressler, working with a friend, developed a filter that would allow women to not see explicit images sent to their messages. Bressler's actions, she wrote in Huffington Post, came after she received a photo on her phone of a man's penis and the message, "Why don't you talk to me?"
Now lawmakers are starting to consider making "cyber flashing," as it's dubbed, a crime:
In January, California state Sen. Ling Ling Chang, a Republican, introduced legislation that would make it illegal to send unsolicited nude images, punishable by a fine.
Just last year, Texas became one of the first states to ban such behavior, instituting fines up to $500.
In 2018, as New York female subway passengers dealt with unwanted sexual images sent via AirDrop to their phones, several city council members introduced legislation to discourage the practice, recommending up to a year in jail, a $1,000 fine or both.
As Joseph Borelli, a Republican council member and a co-sponsor of the legislation, told The New York Times, "Technology has made it significantly easier to be a creep."
The fact that this is a real enough problem to warrant lawmaker attention shows how little #MeToo has made inroads in our culture.
Similarly, the new focus on consent in recent years seems to be a band-aid, not a comprehensive solution. There are contracts for college students to sign to indicate consent to sexual activity, and there are even apps for people to sign a consent contract before sex.
While a renewed attention to consent is welcome, it's also just the most basic human decency when it comes to sexual encounters and sharing explicit images.
Ultimately, the problem in our culture right now seems to be rooted in a me-first mindset of so many – an attitude that prioritizes personal sexual gratification over honoring and respecting the human dignity of others, including would-be sexual partners.
The modern sexual revolution is generally depicted as a welcome liberation, the beginning of a new era of pleasure. But is that interpretation correct?
Undergirding our modern sexual mores is the notion that sexual intimacy can be achieved, and achieved without pain to either partner, without actual personal intimacy – the kind that can only be acquired by communication and companionship over a period of time, not a few hours at a bar.
Curbing the sending of inappropriate sexual images to strangers is a good first step. But when it comes to healing the toxic, often selfish norms of our sexual culture, much more is needed.

Texto completo: BUTLER COUNTY —
Even though two Miami University students tested negative for the deadly coronavirus, a state health official said she understands “there’s still a lot of concern” in the Oxford community and around the country.
Dr. Amy Acton, Ohio Department of Health director, said after the agency announced Sunday night the results of the tests that no people in the state are under investigation for the coronavirus.
“What we are doing in Ohio is working,” Acton said Sunday night at a press conference in Oxford that ended a week of uncertainty around campus.
ODH received results of the three-part test — a blood draw, a nasal swab and a mucus sample — from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta on Sunday afternoon, Acton said. A few hours later, a mass communication went out to the Oxford campus.
Acton called the two students, who had traveled to China and presented flu-like symptoms on Jan. 27, the first day of classes, “victims of circumstances,” and they were released from isolation in their residence on Sunday.
“They are thrilled,” Acton said of the students the university has declined to identify, except to say they traveled to China during Miami’s six-week break between semesters.
Jennifer Bailer, Butler County Health Department commissioner, said she had been “hoping and praying” for negative results. She said the public health agencies benefited from the students’ prompt actions when they reported their illness to Student Health Services.
“They did everything right,” she said. “The system worked.”
The students have been cleared to “conduct normal activities,” Bailer said.
Some Miami students who were in China have not yet completed the 14-day incubation period and are being self-monitored.
Despite the negative test results, Miami University has restricted university-sponsored travel to China for all faculty, staff and students for several weeks. Three summer China programs this year have also been redirected, one Miami student studying abroad in China has returned to the Oxford campus and another student who planned to study in China this semester is staying in Oxford, officials said.
Area hospitals have started asking patients showing flu-like symptoms about their recent travel history, and airlines are restricting flights into China, where the first case of coronavirus was confirmed in December.
Only a handful of American airports are permitted to receive flights from China. The scenes were described as confusing on Monday as the first federally mandated quarantine in more than a half-century took effect.
Americans on some flights from China could be monitored and isolated for up to two weeks on American military bases, according to the New York Times.
China’s Health Commission reported on Sunday that there were 475 recoveries and 361 deaths nationwide, theTimes reported. A total of 349 people died in mainland China during the SARS outbreak, it reported.
Acton said the novel disease is evolving and changing “hour by hour.”
Melanie Amato, ODH press secretary, said the coronavirus scare in Oxford was “a great example” on how partnership works between the state, the Hamilton and Middletown city health departments and the communities.
“Ohio will remain prepared and we will continue to closely monitor the situation in conjunction with CDC and are ready to respond if necessary,” she said.
On Sunday night and they did earlier in the week during another press conference, health and university officials urged the public to show compassion toward international students. Acton said there was “a huge need” for empathy.
Miami has 17,327 undergraduate and 2,607 graduate students on its Oxford campus. Students from China are the university’s largest population of international students with 2,334 enrolled.
About a dozen Miami University Regional campus students in Hamilton and Middletown list their home residence near the area in Wuhan City where the outbreak began in December, according to school officials. Miami officials said Chinese students on both of those campuses have been checked and no issues have been reported.

Texto completo: Attending a meeting near Union Station in Washington, D.C., requires me to park a few blocks away and then walk under a bridge to an office building. People in business attire, like me, step carefully around the homeless men and women who have pitched tents under the bridge. They look filthy and miserable, especially in winter.
The persistence of large numbers of homeless Americans is one of the signal policy failures of the past two generations. A 2015 survey found that more than half a million people are homeless on any given night. According to Mentalillnesspolicy.org, about 45% of them are suffering from mental illness. When they are not on the street, many severely mentally ill people wind up in even worse surroundings. Jane Brody of The New York Times reports that "the country's three largest facilities housing the mentally ill are jails: the Twin Towers in Los Angeles, the Cook County Jail in Chicago and Rikers Island in New York City." More mentally people are in jails and prisons than in hospitals.
Some homeless people are on the streets or in shelters due to misfortunes that no human society ever completely eliminates, but most are afflicted by mental illness or have substance abuse problems or both. According to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, 60% of the chronically homeless have mental health issues.
Governments at every level spend billions on the homeless, yet the numbers sleeping on the streets remain high. In Republican and Democratic administrations, in liberal and conservative regions, thousands of disabled people, some veterans who have served their country, sleep under bridges and in abandoned buildings, and eat out of trash bins.
This is the long tail of the de-institutionalization policy adopted in the 1960s, when America closed down most of its mental hospitals, dumping the mentally ill onto the streets and calling it compassion. Films like "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" cemented the public perception that mental health treatment (especially electroshock therapy) was thinly veiled torture. Since 1955, there has been a 95% reduction in the number of psychiatric beds available. To be sure, there were abuses in asylums, but our experience over the past 50 years has shown that we cannot do without them entirely without paying a price. It costs more to house a mentally ill person in prison than it would in a mental hospital, and prisons are ill-equipped to meet the needs of people whose minds are their worst enemies.
While we certainly need more beds for psychiatric patients, mental hospitals are not the only option for helping these needy people. Programs like Assisted Outpatient Treatment permit judges to supervise patients' compliance with drug and therapy regimens and have been shown to reduce harmful behaviors, arrest rates, homelessness and victimization among the severely mentally ill.
Governments have also failed to prioritize treating the severely mentally ill. Many research and treatment dollars go to the "worried well" rather than to those with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depression. The National Institutes of Mental Health, for example, released a draft of its five-year plan for research in December 2019. It was heavily weighted toward basic brain research at the expense of more pressing research needs.
Dr. E. Fuller Torrey of the Treatment Advocacy Center, while acknowledging that some basic brain research is called for, listed a number of areas that cry out for research. A few examples: 1) Patients complain that when they are prescribed generics, they don't do as well. Study is needed into the efficacy of generic drugs for psychiatric cases. 2) Many drugs prescribed for mental disorders have only been studied for acute effects. More research is needed into their long-term effects. 3) Electroconvulsive therapy is underused in the U.S. compared to other advanced nations (thanks, "Cuckoo's Nest"). Evidence from other nations suggests that it is safe and effective. Controlled, randomized trials are needed. 4) Probiotics have shown promise for the treatment of mental disorders. More study is needed. 5) Four studies have shown a significant connection between cat ownership in childhood and schizophrenia. Studies of toxoplasmosis are needed.
In the 1960s, we persuaded ourselves that closing down mental hospitals was the humane solution to a problem. Today, we are arguably tolerating an even less humane model. The mentally ill, so vulnerable and in need of care, are crowding emergency rooms, languishing in prisons and sleeping under bridges. It's a cliche to say that this should not be the case in the wealthiest country in the world, but it's true.

Thoughts on Titletown, TB12, UMass football, and other sports topics

Texto completo: Picked-up pieces while waiting endlessly for Tom Brady to tell us where he's playing next season . . . for the Red Sox to hire a manager . . . for Rob Manfred to tell us whether the 2018 Red Sox were cheating . . . for Danny Ainge to acquire a big man before Thursday's NBA trading deadline . . .
■ Imagine my surprise when I heard a guy from San Francisco talking about his region as a home of sports champions. Doesn't everybody know that Boston is Titletown, USA? Twelve duck boat parades in this century?
It turns out that the Bay area has been our equal over the last decade, and if the 49ers had prevailed Sunday, that region would have more championships than Boston since 2010. Instead, we are tied with six crowns and 11 appearances in finals over the last decade.
Since 2010, the Bay area has won three World Series (Giants in 2010, 2012, 2014) and three NBA crowns (Warriors 2015, 2017, 2018). In addition, its teams have been in five other championship rounds (2012 Niners, 2016 Sharks and Warriors, 2019 Warriors, and 2019 49ers). Boston since 2010 has six championships in 11 finals (Celtics 0-1, Bruins 1-2, Patriots 3-2, Red Sox 2-0).
■ I remain dazzled at Brady's obsession with all things TB12. He's worse than Gwyneth Paltrow with Goop. Now we're hearing that “incorporating" TB12 into a franchise could be part of Brady's next contract negotiation.
Does Brady really think his high-end, unconventional workout/product corporation is going to become a thriving, global, money-making entity? Call me a small thinker, but I am dubious.
We're all glad it works for Tom, but I see it as unlikely that TB12 will have much impact once Brady is through playing professional football. (At least Brady is not asking to take a bath with taxpayer money, in the fashion of 38 Studios.)
■ Hats off to Bruins captain Zdeno Chara, who'll be honored for reaching the 1,500-game plateau — more than 1,000 with the Bruins — before Saturday's Bruins-Coyotes game at the Garden. The only men who've played more games for the Bruins are Ray Bourque, Johnny Bucyk, Patrice Bergeron, Don Sweeney, and Wayne Cashman.
■ Manfred should hire Ed Davis to crack the case in the Red Sox alleged cheating investigation.
■ Sorry, but David Ortiz shilling for Sox management regarding the “need" to trade Betts is the height of hypocrisy. No big league star complained more about his own contract than Ortiz. Now Big Papi is a company man, delivering the party line for Sox owners.
■ Red Sox mystery man Michael Gordon is quoted in the new Sports Illustrated talking about Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp. Gordon, president of Fenway Sports Group, is described by the magazine as “intensely private." He's also the man who was listed above Larry Lucchino on the club website a few months before Lucchino was bumped from power in the summer of 2015.
■ Every time I see the “new," shrinking Rob Gronkowski, he looks more like the late David Bowie.
■ Quiz: Name five pitchers who started a World Series game for the Red Sox in this century and also won a World Series with another team. (Answer below.)
■ I know it's a topic, but I have spent zero seconds wondering or caring whether Eli Manning will be a Hall of Famer. Eli won one more Super Bowl MVP than his brother Peyton, but threw a whopping 244 interceptions to go with his 366 touchdown passes.
■ The Sports Hub's Marc Bertrand has a good idea to address NBA tanking. “Beetle" suggests that the NBA take all non-playoff teams and put them in a postseason tournament to determine the order at the top of the next draft. The team that wins the tournament of losers gets the No. 1 pick.
■ UMass athletic director Ryan Bamford last month penned a lengthy football manifesto titled “A Strategic Vision for Massachusetts Football." The AD wrote, “One myth that has been cited by the public is the supposed negative financial impact football at UMass has on the taxpayers of the Commonwealth. The belief that football is a drain on state funds is wholly inaccurate."
I had trouble following the math, but evidently the 1-11 team that draws few fans and operates on a $4.225 million budget is hardly costing taxpayers anything at all.
Bamford concluded, “We have reimagined important programmatic areas over this past year, something that was needed to achieve ultimate success. Our progress in these areas has me extremely bullish about our future."
The 2019 Minutemen set a record for defensive futility, giving up a whopping 52.7 points per game. Good seats are available for this year's home opener, Sept. 12 vs. Troy. UMass's Nov. 14 game at Auburn should be a barn-burner.
■ The New York Post ranked the top radio/television sports calls of all time and came up with Al Michaels's “Do you believe in miracles? Yes!" as No. 1. Russ Hodges's “The Giants win the pennant!" was second, and Howard Cosell's “Down goes Frazier!" was third.
Boston was represented by Vin Scully's “Gets through Buckner" (No. 5) and Johnny Most's “Havlicek stole the ball!" (No. 6).
■ New Giants head coach Joe Judge lived next door to the late Aaron Hernandez in North Attleborough when the two both worked for the Patriots. Judge's uncle, Jerry Judge, was a boxer who was KO'd by George Foreman in an exhibition bout.
■ Jim Calhoun, who put Northeastern basketball on the map, doesn't get much love at the Huskies' home gym. Calhoun is represented on a historical timeline display in the men's locker room, but there's no trace of his accomplishments for fans attending games at Matthews Arena.
■ Talented author Jeff Pearlman will be out in September with “Three-Ring Circus: Shaq, Kobe, Phil, and the Crazy Years of the Lakers Dynasty" (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt). The book was completed before Kobe Bryant's sudden death, but will include a prologue addressing it.
■ Speaking of Kobe, all Celtics fans know that the great Sam Jones — winner of 10 championship rings — retired No. 24 for the Green.
■ Boston anesthesiologist Antje Barreveld was voted Most Likely To Succeed along with Bryant when the two were seniors at Lower Merion High School in Ardmore, Pa., in 1996.
■ It's official: Tony Eason is still the only Super Bowl starting quarterback who failed to complete a pass in the game. Eason went 0 for 6 for the Patriots vs. the Bears before he was mercifully replaced by Steve Grogan.
■ This weekend is the 20th anniversary of Hot Stove Cool Music, and the show will be at the Paradise Rock Club Saturday night at 7:30. All for the benefit of the Foundation To Be Named Later. For information, go to FTBNL.org.
■ I needed to watch six hours of Super Bowl pregame to learn that Alex Rodriguez wore No. 13 as an homage to Dan Marino.
■ Good luck to the Massachusetts Coalition to Preserve Girls Field Hockey in its quest to stop the nonsense of a handful of boys playing and dominating a sport with rosters that have been traditionally 100 percent female. It's a joke and a litigious nightmare. The MIAA needs to figure it out.
■ Thought you should know that from 1954-58, the Cincinnati Reds changed their team name to “Redlegs" to avoid being associated with Communism.
■ Jackie Bradley Jr. turns 30 April 19. Just sayin'.
■ Quiz answer: Curt Schilling, John Lackey, Jon Lester, Josh Beckett, and Jake Peavy (thanks, Tyler Kepner of the New York Times).

Resumen: A smartphone app that contributed to the Iowa Democratic caucuses chaos was reportedly created by Shadow, a developer with Democratic ties.

Texto completo: With the threat of election result interference looming, the Iowa Democratic Party took steps to make Monday's caucuses more technologically secure with results that were robust.
Party officials even decided there was an app for that.
Unfortunately, there were issues with the app and instead of Democrats turning their focus toward the New Hampshire primary, to be held Feb. 11, there were still no returns Tuesday morning from Iowa.
The chaos is expected to have repercussions in the short term for the candidates who aren't sure yet how they performed, and in the long term for the Iowa caucus process itself.
"I’d say there is going to be a real movement to change the order of primaries. I really do believe it and I never believed it before," Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia Center for Politics, told the Des Moines Register.
Coronavirus concerns: Hackers are using coronavirus fears to send you a computer virus: How to stop them
Social media misinformation: YouTube says no ‘deepfakes’ or ‘birther’ videos with toughened 2020 election stance
What's this about an app used in the Iowa caucuses?
The Iowa Democratic Party, which had originally considered a virtual caucus, in which voters did not physically have to show up to be counted, opted to create a smartphone app to help caucus managers tabulate and transmit results – the end result being to get results released more quickly to the public.
The decision was set in motion before we learned about a "sweeping and systematic" Russian effort to undermine the presidential election process in 2016.
The Iowa Democratic Party has said the app was tested by an independent third party, but did not release too much information about it. That's because top cybersecurity experts said releasing too much information about the app could result in the developer being targeted.
But that strategy opened the door for potential misuse of misinformation Ashlee Benge, threat researcher for Baltimore-headquartered cybersecurity firm ZeroFox. "This confusion could be exploited by candidates or others with an interest in a particular candidate, in order to perpetuate misinformation about a candidate's success or lack thereof," she told USA TODAY. "This could ultimately be used to influence voter opinion in future votes and potentially sway election results. "
'It was a total mess': Caucusing is long over, but Iowa still doesn't have a winner
Iowa caucuses: We don't know yet who won the Iowa caucuses. But here's what we do know.
So what was the issue?
Early in the evening, party officials began reporting that some precinct officials could not log into the app. One issue apparently was confusion with PIN numbers, reported KCRG, a Cedar Rapids, Iowa, ABC television station.
Precinct chairwoman Ruth Thompson told KCRG that organizers had problems trying to download and test the app. "We came to a consensus not to use it," said Thompson, who chaired a precinct at Lincoln High School in Des Moines.
Emily Duff, who volunteered as a captain for Bernie Sanders' campaign Monday night, expressed concerns about the app before her caucus. Duff's precinct in the gym at Hoover High School in Des Moines wound up reporting results manually, she said.
"People were having issues, so they ditched the app," she said.
Precinct chairs did not have to use the app but could also tabulate results manually – a paper trail is included as a planned redundancy in the system – and call them into a hotline. But telephones were jammed, too.
"We understand that caucus chairs are attempting to – and, in many cases, failing to – report results telephonically to the party. These acute failures are occurring statewide," wrote Dana Remus, general counsel for Biden for President, in a letter to the Iowa Democratic Party executive director Kevin Geiken and chairman Troy Price late Monday, saying the party's new app and its backup phone hotline failed.
So did the app work or not?
Apparently, when the app was used to report results, not all of the data came through, a discrepancy officials noted Monday night, but could not explain at the time.
"“As part of our investigation, we determined with certainty that the underlying data collected via the app was sound. While the app was recording data accurately, it was reporting out only partial data," party chairman Troy Price said in a statement Tuesday morning. "We have determined that this was due to a coding issue in the reporting system. This issue was identified and fixed. The application’s reporting issue did not impact the ability of precinct chairs to report data accurately. "
The system's redundant paper trail is being used to verify and calculate the results, he said. "While our plan is to release results as soon as possible today, our ultimate goal is to ensure that the integrity and accuracy of the process continues to be upheld. ”
Issues could likely be averted with "a digital disaster plan" including stages such as a pilot run and improved field testing and training, says Theresa Payton, who was chief information officer for the White House for President George W. Bush and is founder and CEO of Fortalice Solutions, a cybersecurity consulting firm headquartered in Charlotte, N. C.
"People are pointing at the app, but it’s not just the app. It’s all the processes when the app failed that didn’t work either," said Payton, who has a book due to be published in April entitled "Manipulated: Inside the Cyberwar to Hijack Elections and Distort the Truth. "
Lingering questions about the app's deployment, usability, testing and its creation suggest this is a topic that will soon go away.

Justice Department's Antitrust Chief Recuses Himself From Google Probe; Department cites Makan Delrahim's past work with search giant

Texto completo: WASHINGTON—The Justice Department's chief antitrust enforcement official has recused himself from the department's investigation into whether Alphabet Inc.'s Google is unlawfully suppressing competition.
The department said that as the probe progressed, Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim came to realize that he needed to recuse himself because of his past work in private practice.
Google was a one-time client. In 2007, Mr. Delrahim advised the search giant as it sought approval from the Federal Trade Commission to buy internet ad firm DoubleClick , an acquisition that helped make Google a dominant force in the digital-advertising ecosystem.

* State Attorneys General to Meet With Justice Officials to Coordinate on Google Probe
The recusal is the latest sign that the department regards Google's ad business as a top issue of concern. The company's digital-advertising practices have become an increasingly prominent focus of the investigation, and Mr. Delrahim and the department wanted to remove any appearance of a conflict of interest as the probe progresses further, people familiar with the matter said.
In addition to digital advertising, the department is continuing to examine Google's search and Android businesses as part of the probe, the people said.
Mr. Delrahim previously received ethics clearance to work on the Google probe, but the reversal came last week, after he and ethics officials took stock of recent advances in the Justice Department's investigation, the people said.
Mr. Delrahim "revisited potential conflicts with previous work with the Department of Justice's ethics office. He and the ethics office have decided that he should now recuse himself from a matter within the tech review in an abundance of caution," a department spokesman said.
The New York Times first reported Mr. Delrahim's recusal.
The department for months has been investigating Google, as well as conducting a broader probe into whether other tech giants, including Facebook Inc., are using their dominance in ways that violate U.S. antitrust law . The reviews are expected to last for much of 2020.
Mr. Delrahim isn't sidelined on all Big Tech matters, but his Google recusal brought immediate changes, including on Tuesday, when Mr. Delrahim didn't participate in a scheduled meeting between department officials and state attorneys general about their respective Google investigations.
Even before the recusal, Mr. Delrahim already had been ceding turf within the Justice Department on Big Tech, as top leadership has taken an unusually strong interest in antitrust enforcement against online platforms. Both Attorney General William Barr and Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen are playing an active role in the probes, and each has added antitrust lawyers to their offices.
The internal shifts could make life more difficult—and less predictable—for Google as it may have to deal directly with offices within the Justice Department that don't usually participate in antitrust matters.
Making the situation more complicated, Mr. Delrahim's principal deputy within the Justice Department's antitrust division, Barry Nigro, also recently recused himself in the Google probe, at least for now, according to one of the people familiar with the matter. The reasons for his recusal couldn't immediately be learned.
Antitrust lawyer Ryan Shores, who works in Mr. Rosen's office, is overseeing the department's tech reviews, including the Google probe. The department hired him last fall from Shearman & Sterling LLP, part of its effort to add legal firepower as it considers whether to bring a groundbreaking case against Google or other tech companies.
Mr. Delrahim's recusal had been sought for months by some critics of Google and other Big Tech companies, including Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), a Democratic presidential candidate.

Trump congratulates the wrong state after Super Bowl victory

Texto completo: President Trump did not waste any time Sunday night congratulating the Kansas City Chiefs for defeating the San Francisco 49ers in the Super Bowl.
Except he got their home state wrong.
“Congratulations to the Kansas City Chiefs on a great game, and a fantastic comeback, under immense pressure. You represented the Great State of Kansas" — yikes — “and, in fact, the entire USA, so very well," Trump said in a tweet posted during his Air Force One flight from Palm Beach, Fla., to Washington. “Our country is PROUD OF YOU."
The problem, of course, is that the Chiefs play in the state of Missouri, next door. There is a Kansas City, Kans. a handful of miles away, but it was the kind of mix-up his followers might expect a member of the coastal elite to make, not a president who spends much of his time speaking on behalf of people from that part of the country.
The president's message, as short-lived as it was before it was deleted and replaced with the geographically correct location of the franchise, caught the attention of people on Twitter. One of them was Claire McCaskill, the former Democratic senator from Missouri. And she was not forgiving.
“It's Missouri you stone cold idiot," she wrote.
In the midst of fan celebrations and Twitter arguments over the president's grasp of geography, a new version of the first message suddenly appeared.
“Congratulations to the Kansas City Chiefs on a great game and a fantastic comeback under immense pressure," Trump wrote. “We are proud of you and the Great State of Missouri. You are true Champions!"

Lawmakers fight over S.C. interchange name
“President Donald J. Trump Interchange" or “President and First Lady Barack and Michelle Obama Interchange?" That is the soon-to-be fiercely debated question for state lawmakers in South Carolina whose preferences fall along clear partisan lines.
Each of the resolutions looks to name the junction of Interstate 85 and Interstate 385 near Greenville, where officials recently spent $300 million to build new bridges and untangle traffic. About 200,000 vehicles go through the area every day.
On Jan. 22, two Republicans introduced their resolution to name the interchange the “President Donald J. Trump Interchange."
Six days later, two Democrats introduced their resolution to name the same interchange the “President and First Lady Barack and Michelle Obama Interchange."
Both resolutions are up for a hearing Thursday.

Limbaugh says he's been diagnosed with lung cancer
Conservative radio host and Republican kingmaker Rush Limbaugh said he's been diagnosed with advanced lung cancer.
Addressing listeners on his program Monday, Limbaugh said he will take some days off for further medical tests and to determine treatment.
“I have to tell you something today that I wish I didn't have to tell you," announced Limbaugh, 69. The cancer diagnosis was confirmed by two medical institutions in late January after he experienced his only symptom so far, shortness of breath, on his Jan. 12 birthday weekend, he said.
The hyper-partisan broadcaster has dominated talk radio with a raucous, liberal-bashing style that made him one of the most influential voices of American right-wing politics and inspired other conservative broadcasters including Sean Hannity, Glenn Beck, and Bill O'Reilly.
Limbaugh has frequently been accused of hate-filled speech, including bigotry and blatant racism through his comments and sketches such as "Barack the Magic Negro," a song featured on his show that said Obama "makes guilty whites feel good" and that the politician is “black, but not authentically."

October criminal trial date set for Giuliani associates
An October trial date was set Monday for two associates of Rudy Giuliani who are charged with making illegal campaign contributions.
Lev Parnas was the only defendant among four men facing trial to be at a Manhattan courthouse when US District Judge J. Paul Oetken set the Oct. 5 trial date.
If the trial begins on time, it will occur a month before the presidential election.
Parnas was smiling and wearing an American-flag pin in court. Outside court, he declined to say if he was cooperating. He said he believes the truth will emerge.
Parnas and fellow defendant Igor Fruman had worked with Giuliani to try to convince Ukraine to announce an investigation of former vice president Joe Biden. Biden is seeking the Democratic presidential nomination.
Parnas and Fruman have pleaded not guilty to charges alleging they made illegal campaign contributions to further their business interests and political goals, including the campaign to get the US to replace Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch in Ukraine.
Parnas recently provided congressional investigators with a recording of an April 2018 dinner meeting in which Trump demanded her removal. She was subsequently removed.
Parnas attended the small dinner at his Washington hotel. The recording seemed to contradict the president's statements that he did not know Parnas.

Group hires Amnesty director as new CEO
The executive director of Amnesty International USA will take over as chief executive of the liberal watchdog Southern Poverty Law Center, which is trying to steady itself after months of turmoil that included the firing of its founder.
Margaret Huang, who has led Amnesty International for more than four years, will begin work in April at the Alabama-based nonprofit organization, which announced her hiring Monday.
The announcement came 11 months after the Southern Poverty Law Center fired its founder, Morris Dees, for unspecified reasons and its president, Richard Cohen, resigned. Other staffers also left, and the organization's employees voted to unionize in December.
The organization, which listed $492 million in assets on tax forms for 2018, said it has 350 employees in offices in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, Louisiana, and the District of Columbia.
The announcement about Huang's hiring touted her experience as a leader in the area of human and civil rights.
Karen Baynes-Dunning, a former judge, had served as head of the Southern Poverty Law Center on an interim basis.

Claims that John Bolton's book disclosures are 'top secret' ring hollow

Resumen: What is classified? It all depends on the politicians. Long before Bolton, the Obama White House used classification as a tool of censorship.

Texto completo: Ever since the 9/11 attacks, Republicans and Democrats have conspired to keep Americans increasingly ignorant of what the federal government does. The number of secret federal documents skyrocketed, and any information classified was treated like a political holy relic that could not be exposed without dooming the nation. Ironically, the fate of the Trump presidency may hinge on perpetuating the unjustifiable secrecy now pervading Washington.
John Bolton wrote a book about his experiences as President Donald Trump’s national security adviser that could provide key information regarding Trump’s dealing with the Ukrainian government, and Democratic members of Congress are calling for the manuscript to be made public. Former government officials are obliged to submit their publications for review to ensure that no classified information is revealed. Bolton’s lawyer denies that the book contains classified information, but previous manuscript reviews of other would-be authors have dragged out for months or years.
Obama weaponized classification
Since the 1990s, the number of classified documents annually by federal agencies has increased more than 15 times.
In 2004, then-Rep. Chris Shays, R-Conn. , derided the federal classification system as "incomprehensibly complex" and "so bloated it often does not distinguish between the critically important and the comically irrelevant. "
The New York Times reported in 2005 that federal agencies were “classifying documents at the rate of 125 a minute as they create new categories of semi-secrets bearing vague labels like 'sensitive security information. ' "
Each classified document is tacitly backed by a federal iron fist ready to squash anyone who discloses it without permission. Regardless of whether the Trump White House is conniving to stifle Bolton’s disclosures, it was the Obama White House that weaponized classification. J. William Leonard, former chief of the federal Information Security Oversight Office, complained in 2011 that the Obama administration had "criminally prosecuted more leakers of purportedly classified information than all previous administrations combined. "
Democrats: No super weekend for Democrats with Trump's expected acquittal
For the Obama administration, leaking classified information to the news media was worse than spying for a hostile government. Its Justice Department declared in 2011 that government officials who "elected to disclose the classified information publicly through the mass media" were "posing an even greater threat to society" than do foreign spies.
The Obama administration believed that its classification decrees were so sacrosanct, no federal judge could overturn them. "We don’t think there is a First Amendment right to classified documents," Justice Department lawyer Catherine Dorsey told a federal judge in 2015.
Dorsey agreed that the government’s position was tantamount to claiming that the court "has absolutely no authority" to unseal evidence even if it’s clear the government’s bid to keep it secret is based on "irrationality" or that it’s "hiding something," as The Intercept reported.
Classification is also a literary scourge. Hundreds of thousands of former officials and military personnel with security clearances must allow pre-publication reviews of their books and other writings. Former Justice Department lawyer Jesselyn Radack observed that pre-publication review "has always been a filter to promote fawning memoirs by senior government officials while censoring whistleblowers and critics. "
A 2019 lawsuit claimed that the pre-publication censorship vested excessive power in government officials who, according to The New York Times, "can delay or discriminate against lower-ranking people who criticize government actions, while speedily clearing favorable memoirs and other writings by retired senior officials. "
Jameel Jaffer, executive director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, declared, "This far-reaching censorship system simply can’t be squared with the Constitution. "
Classification: A convenience for politicians to dominate media
Torturers have benefited mightily from censorship. Mark Fallon, a veteran counterintelligence officer and counterterrorism expert, wrote a book entitled "Unjustifiable Means: The Inside Story of How the CIA, Pentagon and U. S. Government Conspired to Torture. " But his account of the torture regime was badly delayed and heavily censored. Fallon charges that books by the architects and apologists for CIA torture — including former CIA Director George Tenet, former acting general counsel John Rizzo and former Counterterrorism Center chief Jose Rodriguez — were treated better in the pre-publication process.
Similarly, when former FBI counterterrorism agent Ali Soufan wrote a book on CIA torture abuses, the CIA demanded that Soufan — who was on-site for brutal interrogations — remove the pronouns "I" and "me" from his narrative. The CIA also deleted quotes in his book that had appeared in congressional hearing transcripts.
Trump will be back: If impeachment-tainted Trump loses in 2020, he'll be back
Classification is often a political flag of convenience that politicians exploit to dominate the media. New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd observed in 2006, "The entire Iraq War was paved by (Bush administration) leaks. Cheney & Co. were so busy trying to prove a mushroom cloud was emanating from (Saddam Hussein’s) direction, they could not leak their cherry-picked stories fast enough. "
Bush administration disclosures of sensitive information were often handed on a silver platter to pliant journalists. Newsweek’s Richard Wolffe explained the Bush White House method: "They declassify when they feel like it. I’ve been with senior administration officials who have just decided to declassify something in front of me because it’s bolstering their argument. "
When federal Judge Amy Berman Jackson sentenced former Trump aide Rick Gates last month, she declared, "If people don't have the facts, democracy doesn't work. "
But Republicans and Democrats in Washington have long since approved denying Americans the facts millions of times a year. Unfortunately, secrecy and lying are often two sides of the same political coin.

Texto completo: Attending a meeting near Union Station in Washington, D.C., requires me to park a few blocks away and then walk under a bridge to an office building. People in business attire, like me, step carefully around the homeless men and women who have pitched tents under the bridge. They look filthy and miserable, especially in winter.
The persistence of large numbers of homeless Americans is one of the signal policy failures of the past two generations. A 2015 survey found that more than half a million people are homeless on any given night. According to Mentalillnesspolicy.org, about 45% of them are suffering from mental illness.
When they are not on the street, many severely mentally ill people wind up in even worse surroundings. Jane Brody of The New York Times reports that "the country's three largest facilities housing the mentally ill are jails: the Twin Towers in Los Angeles, the Cook County Jail in Chicago and Rikers Island in New York City." More mentally people are in jails and prisons than in hospitals.
Some homeless people are on the streets or in shelters due to misfortunes that no human society ever completely eliminates, but most are afflicted by mental illness or have substance abuse problems or both. According to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, 60% of the chronically homeless have mental health issues.
Governments at every level spend billions on the homeless, yet the numbers sleeping on the streets remain high. In Republican and Democratic administrations, in liberal and conservative regions, thousands of disabled people, some veterans who have served their country, sleep under bridges and in abandoned buildings, and eat out of trash bins.
This is the long tail of the de-institutionalization policy adopted in the 1960s, when America closed down most of its mental hospitals, dumping the mentally ill onto the streets and calling it compassion. Films like "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" cemented the public perception that mental health treatment (especially electroshock therapy) was thinly veiled torture. Since 1955, there has been a 95% reduction in the number of psychiatric beds available. To be sure, there were abuses in asylums, but our experience over the past 50 years has shown that we cannot do without them entirely without paying a price. It costs more to house a mentally ill person in prison than it would in a mental hospital, and prisons are ill-equipped to meet the needs of people whose minds are their worst enemies.
While we certainly need more beds for psychiatric patients, mental hospitals are not the only option for helping these needy people. Programs like Assisted Outpatient Treatment permit judges to supervise patients' compliance with drug and therapy regimens and have been shown to reduce harmful behaviors, arrest rates, homelessness and victimization among the severely mentally ill.
Governments have also failed to prioritize treating the severely mentally ill. Many research and treatment dollars go to the "worried well" rather than to those with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depression. The National Institutes of Mental Health, for example, released a draft of its five-year plan for research in December 2019. It was heavily weighted toward basic brain research at the expense of more pressing research needs.
Dr. E. Fuller Torrey of the Treatment Advocacy Center, while acknowledging that some basic brain research is called for, listed a number of areas that cry out for research. A few examples: 1) Patients complain that when they are prescribed generics, they don't do as well. Study is needed into the efficacy of generic drugs for psychiatric cases. 2) Many drugs prescribed for mental disorders have only been studied for acute effects. More research is needed into their long-term effects. 3) Electroconvulsive therapy is underused in the U.S. compared to other advanced nations (thanks, "Cuckoo's Nest"). Evidence from other nations suggests that it is safe and effective. Controlled, randomized trials are needed. 4) Probiotics have shown promise for the treatment of mental disorders. More study is needed. 5) Four studies have shown a significant connection between cat ownership in childhood and schizophrenia. Studies of toxoplasmosis are needed.
In the 1960s, we persuaded ourselves that closing down mental hospitals was the humane solution to a problem. Today, we are arguably tolerating an even less humane model. The mentally ill, so vulnerable and in need of care, are crowding emergency rooms, languishing in prisons and sleeping under bridges. It's a cliche to say that this should not be the case in the wealthiest country in the world, but it's true.

Tribune CEO steps down

Texto completo: Tribune Publishing announced a shake-up of its leadership ranks Monday -- less than three months after hedge fund Alden Global Capital became the company's largest shareholder.
Tim Knight, a longtime company executive who became CEO in January 2019, has been replaced by Terry Jimenez, Tribune Publishing's chief financial officer. Knight will leave the company at the end of the month.
Jimenez will take Knight's seat on the board, the company said in a news release.
Also, board member Philip Franklin has replaced David Dreier as nonexecutive chairman. Dreier will remain on the board.
"These changes are a natural transition as Tribune Publishing works to reduce its corporate and back-office costs and streamline its real estate footprint," Dreier said in the news release.
The change in leadership comes amid an employee buyout program to reduce head count and expenses. At the same time, some journalists at Tribune Publishing newspapers such as the Chicago Tribune and Baltimore Sun have launched independent efforts to find new owners in the face of an increasingly uncertain future under Alden.
Knight, 54, declined to comment Monday. His contract, which paid an annual salary of $600,000 plus up to a 100% cash bonus, was set to expire in January 2022.
Alden, a secretive New York hedge fund with a reputation for dramatic cost-cutting, took a 32% stake in Tribune Publishing in November, mostly by acquiring the stake of former Chairman Michael Ferro. Two Alden representatives subsequently were added to the newspaper company's board, expanding it to eight members. As part of that agreement, Alden is restricted from increasing its stake in the company to more than 33% until June 30.
Launched in 2007, Alden owns about 200 publications through an operating company now known as MediaNews Group, formerly Digital First Media. The chain has come under fire for sweeping layoffs at its newspapers, including major dailies such as the Denver Post, San Jose Mercury News and the St. Paul Pioneer Press, as well as smaller weeklies.
Heath Freeman, Alden's president, did not respond to a request for comment Monday.
Last month, Tribune Publishing offered voluntary buyouts to employees with eight or more years of experience, which based on participation is designed to "avoid turning to company-wide reductions of the workforce as a last resort," Knight said in a January email to employees.
Tribune Publishing had about 4,100 full-time employees at the end of 2019, according to the company.
In addition to the Chicago Tribune, Tribune Publishing owns the Baltimore Sun; Hartford Courant; Orlando Sentinel; South Florida Sun Sentinel; the New York Daily News; the Capital Gazette in Annapolis, Maryland; The Morning Call in Allentown, Pennsylvania; the Daily Press in Newport News, Virginia; and The Virginian-Pilot in Norfolk, Virginia.
The newspaper industry has struggled to compete in the digital media age. Revenue has been cut in half between 2008 and 2018 because of a precipitous decline in print advertising, according to data from Pew Research. During that same time, newsroom employment declined 25%.
On Wednesday, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway announced it will exit the newspaper business, selling its portfolio of mostly smaller and medium-sized dailies to Lee Enterprises for $140 million.
That same day, Alden took a 5.9% stake in Lee Enterprises, buying 3.4 million shares of the publicly traded company for $9.2 million, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
While the newspaper industry struggles with secular revenue declines, initiatives are underway at several Tribune Publishing newspapers to find alternative buyers to preserve local journalism.
Chicago Tribune investigative reporters David Jackson and Gary Marx, who published an op-ed in the New York Times last month warning that Alden's cost-cutting approach could create a "ghost version" of Chicago's oldest and largest daily, have been leading an unusual independent effort to solicit wealthy benefactors to buy and save the newspaper.
Journalists at the Baltimore Sun have been engaged in a similar effort, reaching out to local investors to buy the newspaper before Alden's standstill ends in June.
An attorney, Knight began his media career with the Chicago Tribune's legal department in 1996, and later served as publisher of Newsday, then owned by Tribune Co., the former parent of the Chicago Tribune. In 2011, he became CEO of Wrapports, the Ferro-led former ownership group of the Chicago Sun-Times. Knight rejoined Tribune Publishing as president of digital content in February 2017 and in January 2019 replaced Justin Dearborn as CEO.
Jimenez, 47, has been CFO at Tribune Publishing since 2016. Previously, he was president of Newsday Media Group, a subsidiary of Cablevision Systems in New York. Before that, Jimenez was controller for the Chicago Tribune Media Group from 2003 to 2005.
Jimenez did not respond to a request for comment.
"We will continue working to position the company to navigate the industry-wide challenges while continuing to serve our communities with high-quality journalism," Jimenez said in the news release.

Texto completo: Inside a warehouse on the outskirts of Berlin, a long line of blue crates moved down a conveyor belt, carrying light switches, sockets and other electrical parts. As they came to a stop, five workers picked through the small items, placing each one in a cardboard box.
At Obeta, an electrical parts company that opened in 1901, it is the kind of monotonous task workers have performed for years.
But several months ago, a new worker joined the team. Stationed behind protective glass, a robot using three suction cups at the end of its long arm does the same job, sifting through parts with surprising speed and accuracy.
While it may not seem like much, this component-sorting robot is a major advance in artificial intelligence and the ability of machines to perform human labor.
"I've worked in the logistics industry for more than 16 years and I've never seen anything like this," said Peter Puchwein, vice president of Knapp, an Austrian company that provides automation technology for warehouses.
Standing nearby at the Obeta warehouse, the California engineers who made the robot snapped pictures with their smartphones. They spent more than two years designing the system at a startup called Covariant.AI, building on their research at the University of California, Berkeley.
Their technology is an indication that, in the coming years, few warehouse tasks will be too small or complex for a robot. And as the machines master tasks traditionally handled by humans, their development raises new concerns about warehouse workers losing their jobs to automation.
Because most companies will be slow to adopt the latest robotic technologies, economists believe the advances will not cut into the overall number of logistics jobs anytime soon. But the engineers building these technologies admit that at some point most warehouse tasks will be done by machines.
The engineers at Covariant specialize in a branch of artificial intelligence called reinforcement learning. The machines are wired to learn new tasks on their own through extreme trial and error. And the best place to learn is in the real world.
"If you want to advance artificial intelligence, you don't just do it in a lab," said Peter Chen, Covariant's chief executive and co-founder. "There is a huge gap in bringing it to the real world."
Warehouses are already highly automated. At the facility outside Berlin, other robots have long been used to fetch large boxes from shelves several stories high.
Picking through a bin of random items is different. Shapes vary, as do surfaces. One light switch might be upside down, the other right-side up. The next electrical gadget might be in a plastic bag that reflects light in ways a robot has never seen. A human touch has been needed.
Covariant, which is working with Knapp, built software that could learn through trial and error. First, the system learned from a digital simulation of the task -- a virtual re-creation of a bin filled with random items. Then, when Chen and his colleagues transferred this software to a robot, it could pick up items in the real world.
The robot could continue to learn as it sorted through items it had never seen before. Inside the German warehouse, the robot can pick and sort more than 10,000 different items, and it does this with more than 99% accuracy, according to Covariant.

Texto completo: In the climactic moment in the World War I drama "1917," a British lance corporal dodges explosions and charging soldiers as he runs across a battlefield in an attempt to deliver an order that could save hundreds of lives. When George MacKay, the actor who plays that determined soldier, first read the scene, "I was completely taken by it," he said. "I could see it very clearly in my mind."
Yet he wasn't prepared for the scene's impact when he finally saw this best-picture contender on the big screen after months of rehearsals and two stressful days of shooting on Salisbury Plain in southern England. "To be honest, I cried," MacKay said. "I don't usually get that emotional watching something I've been involved in because I'm more objective, but I found it so moving."
I asked the British actor to break down how he, the director, Sam Mendes, and other crew members put this sequence together. These are edited excerpts from our recent telephone conversation.

The preparation
In the complicated visual conceit of "1917," multiple takes were seamlessly edited together to make the film appear as if it were made up of a single shot. So Mendes and his cast and crew required extensive preproduction. "The first time we rehearsed this scene, Sam gave me a lovely note," MacKay recalled. "He said, as much as there's desperation and it's intense and what he's running to is so serious, there's almost a euphoria to it as well. It's this kind of utter release."
The long run-up to filming also allowed MacKay time to get in shape. "I did a lot of sprint training," he said. "It was about 300 meters, and the first time I ran it, Sam said, 'Don't go too fast or you'll overtake the camera.' I was absolutely busting it, and I had to do everything I could just to keep up. But by the time we shot it, I was quite fit."
It was Mendes' idea that MacKay should begin the scene at a slower pace before breaking into a run. "The first time, I took off," MacKay said. "I'd forgotten what the scene was about. Sam said, 'Why don't you start walking, almost like you can't believe you've done it?' My character is so set on what he's doing, he's almost out of his body."

The filming
The pressure was on when the scene was shot near the end of the production schedule.
"We knew we had only four or five goes at it," said MacKay. "All of the explosions were real, and it took five hours to reset the dynamite for each take."
The filming necessitated complex choreography behind the scenes: Two grips had to transfer the camera midshot from a large crane to a moving vehicle. The crew members were dressed as soldiers since they passed in front of the lens. "It was such a delicate move," MacKay said. "It was like passing a baton in a relay."
The first take wasn't completed because MacKay got tangled up with some of the 500 background actors who were playing the troops. "Suddenly, I thought, 'Oh, this can go wrong,' " MacKay said. "You want to get one in the bank straight away."
Take 2 was more successful, despite two unplanned collisions that made it into the final cut. "The rule throughout the shoot was you don't stop until Sam says so," MacKay said. "As soon as the collisions happened, they felt inevitable. There's a grace to the run, but there's also a reality to the fact that he got knocked about on the way."
MacKay wasn't seriously injured by the mishaps. "I got a couple of bumps and bruises, but I was so warmed up, I didn't feel them at the time," he said. "There may have been a couple of choice words said, but they came out in the edit."

The final result
Following two more takes on a second day of shooting, MacKay knew he had nailed the scene. "It was the biggest high," he said. "It was the cul-mination of months of work. I remember leaping around the field. My heart's pumping just talking about it."
The director acknowledged his company's accomplishment.
"Sam made a little speech afterward, which he didn't do for any other scenes," MacKay said. "He just said thank you, and that this was a shot he'd been dreaming of for a long time. And all of a sudden, hundreds of men started chanting his name. It was a huge celebration."
Still, MacKay wasn't sure what to expect before he saw the scene for the first time at a screening.
"I didn't watch the takes as we did it, so I had no idea what it looked like," MacKay said. "I just knew how special it was for everyone during the making of it."
MacKay felt equally privileged when he viewed the end result.
"In a way, that shot is a reflection of the entire film," MacKay said. "It's a very simple journey through massive difficulty, but there's the notion that it has to get done."
The scene did get done, and MacKay is grateful.
"It's something that will always be with me," MacKay said. "I can feel it in my heart and in my legs."

'Cyber flashing': Tip of toxic sexual culture

Texto completo: If you've waded into the jungle of online dating, chances are you've been exposed to a graphic image that you never wanted to see -- especially if you're a young woman.
Over half of women ages 18-29 have received an explicit image they never asked for, according to a 2017 Pew Research Center study. Among all women, 32% have, while 30% of men have.
It's so widespread a problem that one internet user, Kelsey Bressler, working with a friend, developed a filter that would allow women to not see explicit images sent to their messages. Bressler's actions, she wrote in Huffington Post, came after she received a photo on her phone of a man's penis and the message, "Why don't you talk to me?"
Now lawmakers are starting to consider making "cyber flashing," as it's dubbed, a crime:
In January, California state Sen. Ling Ling Chang, a Republican, introduced legislation that would make it illegal to send unsolicited nude images, punishable by a fine.
Just last year, Texas became one of the first states to ban such behavior, instituting fines up to $500.
In 2018, as New York female subway passengers dealt with unwanted sexual images sent via AirDrop to their phones, several city council members introduced legislation to discourage the practice, recommending up to a year in jail, a $1,000 fine or both.
As Joseph Borelli, a Republican council member and a co-sponsor of the legislation, told The New York Times, "Technology has made it significantly easier to be a creep."
#MeToo is failing
The fact that this is a real enough problem to warrant lawmaker attention shows how little #MeToo has made inroads in our culture.
Similarly, the new focus on consent in recent years seems to be a band-aid, not a comprehensive solution. There are contracts for college students to sign to indicate consent to sexual activity, and there are even apps for people to sign a consent contract before sex.
While a renewed attention to consent is welcome, it's also just the most basic human decency when it comes to sexual encounters and sharing explicit images. Consider resigned Rep. Katie Hill's comments in The Times regarding the sexual images of her that circulated online: "I was overwhelmed by everything -- by how many people had seen my naked body, by the comments, the articles, the millions of opinions, the texts, the calls. I would start shaking, crying, throwing up."
While the California Democrat's case raises interesting questions about transparency, and voters' rights to know about the character of their lawmaker, shouldn't we be able to agree that such measures should be accomplished without exposing private images to the whole internet?
Ultimately, the problem in our culture right now seems to be rooted in a me-first mindset of so many -- an attitude that prioritizes personal sexual gratification over honoring and respecting the human dignity of others, including would-be sexual partners.
Researchers in a July article for the Journal of Sex Research found that "men who reported having sent unsolicited (penis pictures) demonstrated higher levels of narcissism and endorsed greater ambivalent and hostile sexism than their nonsending counterparts."
In other words: Pair focus on self with little respect for women, and you've got the formula for the kind of jerk who think it's a swell idea to send explicit images without consent.
The modern sexual revolution is generally depicted as a welcome liberation, the beginning of a new era of pleasure. But is that interpretation correct?
Reconsider 'Little Women'
Watching "Little Women" -- the hit Oscar-nominated movie from brilliant director Greta Gerwig -- it is easy to be wistful for an era where men sought to improve themselves to win women's hearts, and where a tender gesture of love was secretly holding onto a lady's glove, not sending her a graphic sexual image. Sure, I wouldn't like the dauntingly limited career prospects of the "Little Women" heroines, but are we so confident their romantic lives were more stifling than ours?
Undergirding our modern sexual mores is the notion that sexual intimacy can be achieved, and achieved without pain to either partner, without actual personal intimacy -- the kind that can only be acquired by communication and companionship over a period of time, not a few hours at a bar. In fact, that same Journal of Sex Research article found that "the most frequently reported motivational category for sending genital images was a transactional mindset (i.e., motivated by hopes of receiving images in return), while the most commonly desired reaction from recipients was that of sexual excitement." Sending these pictures may just be a way to cut short the conversation and go straight to the sexual activity.
Curbing the sending of inappropriate sexual images to strangers is a good first step. But when it comes to healing the toxic, often selfish norms of our sexual culture, much more is needed.

Texto completo: What will they see when they look in a mirror for the rest of their lives?
Marco Rubio, Rick Scott and 49 other Republican senators will need rose-colored glasses. Otherwise, they'll see the yellow badge of cowardice. They'll see political opportunists who betrayed our country and our Constitution to continue feasting at the king's table.
Florida's senators helped bring the farce that purports to be the impeachment trial of President Trump to its pre-determined climax Friday. They voted to end it without hearing any witnesses or seeing any documents that might further strengthen the compelling case presented by the House of Representatives.
Don't trouble us with the facts, they said. Above all, keep the facts from the American people.
Every day shines more light on what they're desperate to hide, what John Bolton and Trump's inner circle might reveal under oath. But of course, Bolton, the president's former national security adviser, is already saying it in the pages being leaked from his unpublished manuscript.
Only hours before the Senate's vote, the New York Times reported extremely damaging new details on Trump's campaign to extort Ukraine into smearing his potential Democratic election opponent, Joe Biden.
Bolton's manuscript, according to the New York Times, reveals the president tried to involve him in the scheme. He identifies witnesses: Trump's personal lawyer and fixer, Rudy Giuliani; acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney; and White House counsel Pat Cipollone, Trump's lead defender.
That makes them all indispensable witnesses to Trump's crime.
But by a 51-49 margin, the Senate chose to hear no evil, see no evil.
Friday was a day that will live in infamy.
Though the final vote to acquit Trump was put off until Wednesday, the outcome is not in doubt. It never was.
Only two Republicans, Mitt Romney of Utah and Susan Collins of Maine, voted to make a real trial out of it. Collins alone knows whether she did so out of conviction or for fear of being denied re-election in a Democratic-leaning state. It's believed Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell gave her a pass after Tennessee's Lamar Alexander sealed the deal, making her allegiance unnecessary.
Romney was promptly disinvited to this year's Conservative Political Action Conference. But Romney is the true conservative and he puts that cast of puppets to shame. Almost alone in the radicalized Republican Party, he opposes absolute power because it corrupts absolutely.
Trump recognizes no boundaries. That is the paramount issue for the voters, the ultimate jury for a power-mad president and a craven Senate. It is critical to replace the Senate leadership, as well as Trump himself, so that a wiser Congress can salvage our democracy.
In 1776, the American colonies declared their independence from a kingdom. In 1787, the founders adopted a Constitution meant to forever forbid the trappings and perquisites of monarchy. As Benjamin Franklin described it to an inquisitor, "A republic, madam - if you can keep it."
The answer hangs in the balance in the November election.
McConnell and the Republican Senate caucus have licensed Trump, and his successors, to do whatever suits them to win an election.
Beg more interference from Russia? Check. Manipulate congressional appropriations for personal benefit? Check. Defy Congress' constitutional power to investigate, no matter how outrageous the offense? Check. There is no limit.
The 51 senators will make excuses for voting as they did. The most astonishing, so far, was Alexander's. He said he didn't need any more evidence because the House managers had proved their case. He just didn't think Trump's conduct was bad enough to remove him from office.
Rubio said much the same, with some claptrap about partisanship added on. He fretted that it would worsen the nation's deep divisions. As if emboldening the nation's divider-in-chief won't do just that.
Regardless of how they might try to spin it, the Republican senators failed to repudiate what Alan Dershowitz, Trump's most outlandish advocate, had advised them on Wednesday.
This is what he said:
"Every public official that I know believes that his election is in the public interest. And mostly you're right. Your election is in the public interest. And if a president does something which he believes will help him get elected in the public interest, that cannot be the kind of quid pro quo that results in impeachment."
There has never been a president who did not confuse his election with the public interest.
By such twisted logic, Richard Nixon could have rationalized the Watergate coverup.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi spoke to the Senate's shame during a visit with this editorial board on Friday.
"I don't know how they answer to their children or grandchildren," she said.
In one of William Shakespeare's most popular plays, he imagined King Henry V prowling incognito among his troops on the eve of the battle of Agincourt in 1415. He had broken a truce to invade France. Not knowing to whom he's speaking, one of the soldiers rationalizes that "we know enough, if we know we are the king's subjects. If his cause be wrong, our obedience to the king wipes the crime of it out of us."
The obedience of 51 U.S. Senators to a corrupt American president who craves kingly powers does not wipe the crime of it out of them. They stamped themselves with his offenses as indelibly as the impeachment will forever mark him. It will be the lead line in their obituaries.

Texto completo: Q: We've been watching old episodes of "Dog the Bounty Hunter" on Justice Network. Beth, his wife, was so pretty. Let us know about her death. And is Dog ill now?
A: Beth Chapman, the wife of Duane "Dog" Chapman, died in June 2019 after a recurrence of throat cancer. Her final days were chronicled on "Dog's Most Wanted." A profile of Chapman in the New York Times said that after Beth's death, Dog suffered a pulmonary embolism. Since then he has worked at losing weight and cutting back his smoking. "But sunblock and quitting tanning salons aren't happening," the Times said of the man with "beet-red tanned skin." He still has trouble sleeping and eating well and has gout. But the Times reported Chapman has plans for another TV show and wants to write a book about Beth. As for the scandal around his use of a racial slur, he is still apologizing, saying "I was wrong."

Q: I know the actress Bridget Hanley played a role in the TV series "Here Come the Brides" in the late 1960s. I'm wondering what other TV shows she was in.
A: "Here Come the Brides" aired on ABC in 1968-70 and was inspired by the movie "Seven Brides for Seven Brothers." In the series, the operator of a logging camp arranged for 100 women to come to Seattle so the men there would keep working. The cast was noteworthy for a couple of rising stars, David Soul and Bobby Sherman. Hanley played Candy Pruitt, the "straw boss" of the women, according to "The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable Shows."
Before that show, Hanley had been a regular on "The Second Hundred Years," a 1967-68 comedy about a prospector (Monte Markham) who thawed out after being frozen since 1900. She would be back in a series a decade later, co-starring with Barbara Eden in "Harper Valley P.T.A.," a comedy inspired by Jeannie C. Riley's hit song of the same name. She also guest-starred on an abundance of comedies and dramas according to the Internet Movie Database, up to 1996, as well as working in theater.

Q: We have been enjoying the Netflix series "Anne With an E," loosely based on the story "Anne of Green Gables." We read that the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. and Netflix were unable to agree on continuing the series. What information do you have?
A: There's always a chance of a show getting revived these days; the fans of "Anne With an E" are certainly lobbying for its continuation. But the issue here goes beyond one show into one of who will make and profit from shows. Before breaking up with Netflix, the CBC became concerned that working with the international giant was hurting its own operations in Canada: "A number of countries have done deals, as we did, with Netflix," a top executive told the Content Canada podcast, "and over time we start to see that we're feeding the growth of Netflix, or we're feeding the growth of Amazon, rather than feeding our own domestic business and industry."

Q: I enjoyed "Virgin River" so much, but the ending so left you hanging. Will they do another series? I did buy some of the sequel books titled "Virgin River" but I want shows!.
A: Netflix has ordered a second season of the show based on the books by Robyn Carr. Look for it later this year.

Texto completo: SAN FRANCISCO - It has become common wisdom that too much time spent on smartphones and social media is responsible for a recent spike in anxiety, depression and other mental health problems, especially among teenagers.
But a growing number of academic researchers have produced studies that suggest the common wisdom is wrong.
The latest research, published last month by two psychology professors, combs through about 40 studies that have examined the link between social media use and both depression and anxiety among adolescents. That link, according to the professors, is small and inconsistent.
"There doesn't seem to be an evidence base that would explain the level of panic and consternation around these issues," said Candice L. Odgers, a professor at the University of California at Irvine and the lead author of the paper, which was published in the Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry.
The debate over the harm we - and especially our children - are doing to ourselves by staring into phones is generally predicated on the assumption that the machines we carry in our pockets pose a significant risk to our mental health.
Worries about smartphones have led Congress to pass legislation to examine the impact of heavy smartphone use and pushed investors to pressure big tech companies to change the way they approach young customers.
The World Health Organization said last year that infants under a year old should not be exposed to electronic screens and that children between the ages of 2 and 4 should not have more than an hour of "sedentary screen time" each day.
Even in Silicon Valley, technology executives have made a point of keeping the devices and the software they develop away from their own children.
But some researchers question whether those fears are justified. They are not arguing that intensive use of phones does not matter. Children who are on their phones too much can miss out on other valuable activities, such as exercise. And research has shown that excessive phone use can exacerbate the problems of certain vulnerable groups, such as children with mental health issues.
They are, however, challenging the widespread belief that screens are responsible for broad societal problems like the rising rates of anxiety and sleep deprivation among teenagers. In most cases, they say, the phone is just a mirror that reveals the problems a child would have even without the phone.
The researchers worry that the focus on keeping children away from screens is making it hard to have more productive conversations about topics like how to make phones more useful for low-income people, who tend to use them more, or how to protect the privacy of teenagers who share their lives online.
"Many of the people who are terrifying kids about screens, they have hit a vein of attention from society and they are going to ride that. But that is super bad for society," said Andrew Przybylski, director of research at the Oxford Internet Institute, who has published several studies on the topic.
The new article by Odgers and Michaeline R. Jensen, of the University of North Carolina at Greensboro, comes just a few weeks after the publication of an analysis by Amy Orben, a researcher at the University of Cambridge, and shortly before the planned publication of similar work from Jeff Hancock, the founder of the Stanford Social Media Lab. Both reached similar conclusions.
"The current dominant discourse around phones and well-being is a lot of hype and a lot of fear," Hancock said. "But if you compare the effects of your phone to eating properly or sleeping or smoking, it's not even close."
Hancock's analysis of about 226 studies on the well-being of phone users concluded that "when you look at all these different kinds of well-being, the net effect size is essentially zero."
The debate about screen time and mental health goes back to the early days of the iPhone. In 2011, the American Academy of Pediatrics published a widely cited paper that warned doctors about "Facebook depression."
Concern about the connection between smartphones and mental health has also been fed by high-profile works such as a 2017 article in The Atlantic - and a related book - by psychologist Jean Twenge, who argued that a recent rise in suicide and depression among teenagers was linked to the arrival of smartphones.
In her article, "Have Smartphones Ruined a Generation?," Twenge attributed the sudden rise in reports of anxiety, depression and suicide from teens after 2012 to the spread of smartphones and social media. Twenge's critics argue that her work found a correlation between the appearance of smartphones and a real rise in reports of mental health issues, but that it did not establish that phones were the cause.
It could, researchers argue, just as easily be that the rise in depression led teenagers to excessive phone use at a time when there were many other potential explanations for depression and anxiety. What's more, anxiety and suicide rates appear not to have risen in large parts of Europe, where phones have also become more prevalent.
"Why else might American kids be anxious other than telephones?" Hancock said. "How about climate change? How about income inequality? How about more student debt? There are so many big giant structural issues that have a huge impact on us but are invisible and that we aren't looking at."
Twenge remains committed to her position, and she points to several more recent studies by other academics who have found a specific link between social media use and poor mental health. One paper found that when a group of college students gave up social media for three weeks, their sense of loneliness and depression declined.

The Truth About the 'Public Charge' Immigration Rule

Texto completo: The Supreme Court last week lifted a nationwide injunction against Trump administration regulations imposing tougher standards for aliens attempting to prove that they won't become "public charges." Under the old guidelines, established during the Clinton era, only cash assistance or long-term institutional care could be considered strikes against applicants. Only a few hundred applicants were refused under the public charge provision world-wide each year.
The new rules will allow immigration officials to consider noncash benefits such as food stamps, Medicaid and housing vouchers in evaluating whether an alien would be a public charge in the U.S. Cue the outrage. "Supreme Court Allows Trump's Wealth Test for Green Cards," read the headline of a New York Times news story. "Public charge is racist," tweeted Rep. Mike Pocan (D., Wis.). Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tweeted: "The American dream isn't a private club with a cover charge."
As a foreign-service officer during the George W. Bush administration, I witnessed how lax public-charge standards led to the admission of aliens who were likely to be dependent on government assistance. As for the new rules, they are nowhere near as draconian as critics suggest:
-- Contrary to Mr. Pocan's racism claim, the rules place no special burden on nonwhite migrants. In my first tour, I dealt primarily with poor, white Kosovars; in my second, with mostly black applicants from Trinidad. Both times, I encountered many poorly qualified applicants who were likely to use benefits in the U.S., but we were discouraged from rejecting anyone under the public-charge provision of the law.
-- The new restrictions don't apply to immigrants who already have green cards, or to refugees and asylum seekers. Only applicants who have relied on welfare programs for an aggregate period of at least 12 months in the most recent three-year period will be considered potential public charges. Use of programs before the introduction of the new rules on Oct. 15, 2019, won't count. There are also exemptions for children, pregnant women, those serving in the U.S. military and those who obtained Medicaid while treating a medical emergency.
-- The public-charge rules don't apply only to immigrants, but also to those seeking to extend nonimmigrant visas, such as tourists and students.
-- Homeland Security and State Department officials don't have access to databases that would allow them to check if an applicant has secured food stamps or other benefits, so only applicants honest enough to self-report welfare use will be affected.
-- The new regulations specifically state that aliens won't be declared public charges based on a single strike against them -- such as having received food stamps in the past -- but rather "on the totality of the circumstances presented in an applicant's case," which could include mitigating factors, such as an applicant's new job or improved financial situation.
The risk that legal aliens will become public charges is real. Most immigrants come to the U.S. based on "family preference" immigrant visas and are required to have sponsors, who are, in theory, supposed to ensure their foreign relatives don't become public charges. In my experience, the income requirements for sponsorship are remarkably lenient. A naturalized citizen with a household income of only $21,137 can sponsor another immigrant.
Despite those modest income requirements, most of the thousands of sponsors I encountered didn't make enough to qualify (or at least didn't report enough income on their taxes). In these cases, applicants are allowed to secure a co-sponsor -- anyone willing to sign an affidavit of support that is rarely if ever enforced.
Many of the immigrants I interviewed were poorly prepared, with little English and without the skills and experience American employers would require. Many do find work, but it tends to be low-paying and without benefits. The Migration Policy Institute, which opposes the new rules, estimates "that a majority of future applicants from Latin America and Africa could be denied under the new test." If this is true, it is a powerful case for a merit-based immigration system.
Under the new rule, immigration officials will retain the ability to look at many factors in assessing immigrants' qualifications. Very few of those who enforce U.S. immigration laws want to prevent migrants from coming to the country. I certainly didn't. But the desire to let people in needs to be balanced against an obligation to uphold the law and protect the interests of taxpayers. According to the Census Bureau, about 1 in 8 Americans lives below the poverty line. Until Congress enacts a merit-based immigration system, the tougher public-charge rules are the best tool for ensuring that immigration makes America richer rather than poorer.

Texto completo: The 20th century represented the triumph of mixed economies over central planning. But the 21st century may turn out very differently because of changes in advanced economies.
Communist states, such as the Soviet Union, Mao's China, North Korea and so on suffered various degrees of economic failure amid rigid central control of the economy. Meanwhile, countries that relied on government regulation and fiscal redistribution simply to smooth out capitalism's rough edges - the U.S., France, Germany, Japan, South Korea - experienced political stability and rising living standards. Democratic countries that experimented with extensive nationalization of industry or pervasive regulation, such as India and the U.K., struggled until they implemented market reforms. Meanwhile, the spectacular results of China's own market liberalization are well known.
Now socialists want to give it another try. Although Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party was defeated in the U.K., there is increasing speculation that Bernie Sanders might win the Democratic presidential nomination, if not the presidency.
Mr. Sanders is no middle-of-the-road social democrat, but a true socialist. In addition to wealth taxes much higher than anything Europe has tried, his proposals include giving workers substantial partial ownership and control of all publicly traded corporations, national rent control and a huge build-out of public housing, nationalization of the energy industry and direct federal funding to make all public universities free. He and his supporters also praise the U.K.'s fully nationalized health care system.
Would Mr. Sanders' brand of socialism fail the way 20th-century communism failed? To think about that, it's important to consider why markets tend to work in the first place.
Economists generally think that markets have three big advantages over Soviet-style central planning: information, competition and trade.
All three were all sorely lacking in the insular, centrally planned economies of the communist bloc during the Cold War; collective agriculture led to the starvation of millions, while communist manufacturing was famously inefficient.
But developed economies look little like the industrial economies of the mid-20th century. Private manufacturing is only 11% of the U.S. economy, while farm output is just 1%. Meanwhile, health care has been steadily climbing as a share of gross domestic product:
Most developed countries show a similar pattern. They're also spending more on education. These industries are responsible for a growing share of employment.
It's very possible, therefore, that the future of advanced economies will be a plateau in the output of manufactured goods and food and an increase in the consumption of services. Those in the middle class may simply be more or less satisfied with the amount of physical stuff they have and may be more interested in personal-care services.
And the service industries of the future may not be as subject to the magic of free markets as agriculture and manufacturing. Prices in health care are not very good signals of cost and value because of asymmetric information, uncertainty and other problems; this is why you don't often see people price-shopping for health services.
As for education, its benefits lie in the distant future and are hard to gauge in advance; many people derive great benefit from college, but the economic gains don't seem closely related to the price paid. And when people don't know what they're getting or aren't able to shop around, competition can't work its magic.
It's no coincidence that health insurance and college are two of the main industries Mr. Sanders is targeting for nationalization or quasi-nationalization. Indeed, these services are already nationalized in most advanced countries, and public education is already public. The structural shift to service economies might thus give socialism an advantage it never enjoyed in the 20th century.
But if the new socialists interfere too much with industries where markets work well, they might find themselves repeating old mistakes.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - Speaking before senators who already had made up their minds, House Democrats on Monday warned of election interference in the 2020 presidential contest and that congressional investigations could continue after President Donald Trump's likely acquittal in the third impeachment trial in U.S. history.
The six House Democrats arguing the case against Mr. Trump came back to the Senate floor after failing to convince the majority of senators to call witnesses in the impeachment trial. The Senate last week voted 51-49 to reject efforts to subpoena witnesses and documents, effectively ending the trial.
With the Republican-controlled chamber ready to acquit Mr. Trump on Wednesday, the Democrats tailored their closing arguments to the implications of leaving the president in office.
"President Trump remains a clear and present danger," Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., told the senators. "He is decimating our global standing as a beacon of democracy while corrupting our free and fair elections here at home."
House Democrats accused Mr. Trump of abusing his power by freezing nearly $400 million in military aid to Ukraine and delaying a White House meeting with its new president to extort the American ally into helping his prospects in this November's election.
Mr. Trump, the Democrats asserted, demanded Ukraine announce a probe into a Ukrainian energy firm, Burisma, on whose board sat Hunter Biden, son of former Vice President Joe Biden. In December, the House impeached Mr. Trump on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.
On Monday, Mr. Jeffries suggested the 2020 presidential election could be in doubt if the Senate were to leave Mr. Trump in office.
"Absent conviction and removal, how can we be assured that this president will not do it again?" Mr. Jeffries asked.
"If we are to rely on the next election to judge the president's efforts to cheat in that election, how can we know that the election will be free and fair? How can we know that every vote will be free from foreign influence, solicited by the president himself?"
Sen. Joe Manchin, a moderate Democrat from West Virginia, proposed a different resolution, asking his colleagues to consider censuring Mr. Trump, a less severe outcome than removal from office.
"What the president did was wrong," Mr. Manchin said in a speech on the Senate floor.
White House lawyers have argued Mr. Trump did nothing wrong and lobbed their own accusations of election interference. They portrayed the impeachment inquiry as a rushed, politically motivated exercise that arose from policy disagreements rather than the "high crimes and misdemeanors" set out in the Constitution.
"This is an effort to overturn the result of one election and to try to interfere in the coming election, which begins today in Iowa," White House Counsel Pat A. Cipollone said Monday.
Jay Sekulow, another attorney for Mr. Trump, played a compilation of video clips showing congressional Democrats talking about their desire to impeach Mr. Trump well before the inquiry began last September.
"There's nothing in the charges that could permit the removal of a duly elected president," he said.
Friday's vote to reject witnesses came after pleas from Democrats to call John Bolton, Mr. Trump's former national security adviser.
Mr. Bolton's upcoming book, called "The Room Where It Happened: A White House Memoir," reportedly details direct conversations with Mr. Trump about the freeze in military aid to Ukraine.
The New York Times reported Friday that an Oval Office conversation occurred in early May and was attended by Mr. Cipollone, who is leading Mr. Trump's defense in the impeachment trial.
On Monday, Mr. Jeffries hinted that there could be further action by House Democrats to pursue the full picture of what happened.
"Whatever the outcome in this trial, we will remain vigilant in the House," he said. "There are dedicated public servants who know the difference between right and wrong."
Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., named the nearly two dozen staff members who helped assemble the House impeachment inquiry. Mr. Schiff, chair of the House Intelligence Committee and leader of the prosecution, portrayed them as dedicated, nonpartisan public servants who have been subjected to "vicious false attacks" for their involvement in the inquiry.
The House staff are "brilliant, hardworking and patriotic, and they deserve better than the attacks they have been forced to suffer," Mr. Schiff said.
Mr. Schiff, in giving the last of the closing remarks, seemed to speak directly to moderate Republicans who swung against voting for witnesses. One of those senators, Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., acknowledged the House had proven its case but believed Mr. Trump's actions did not rise to the level of impeachable crimes.
History will not be kind to Mr. Trump, Mr. Schiff said, and senators should consider their vote as a consequential link to the president.
"If you find that the House has proved its case and still vote to acquit, your name will be tied to his with a cord of steel and for all of history," Mr. Schiff said.
"But if you find the courage to stand up to him, to speak the awful truth to his rank falsehood, your place will be among the Davids who took on Goliath," he said.
He went on, "Every single vote - even a single vote by a single member - can change the course of history. . Is there one among you who will say: 'Enough?' "
The House Democrats used about the full two hours allotted to each side, while the White House used about an hour.
The Senate adjourned and will reconvene to vote on the verdict at 4 p.m. Wednesday.

Texto completo: Speculation is that in an upcoming book by John Bolton, the former national security adviser, claims that President Donald Trump told him that he wanted to freeze aid to Ukraine until the country aided investigations into Democrat and former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden.
One of the president's chief defenders, lawyer Alan Dershowitz, responded in the Senate on Jan. 27, that "nothing in the Bolton revelations, even if true, would rise to the level of an abusive power or an impeachable offense." GOP senators responsible for passing judgment on the president's behavior seem to be warming to this notion.
My question is, would any actions of this type ever rise to the level of an impeachable offense? Would there be no limit to the number of foreign leaders the president could ask to announce investigations into political rivals in exchange for release of congressionally mandated foreign aid?
If so, where would it end? How would a candidate from the opposing party have any chance of being elected if the incumbent was free to ask other countries for help in besmirching that candidate - either to benefit his or her re-election or the election of a successor candidate from the same party? With such a corrupt benefit to incumbency, that party could hold on to the White House in perpetuity.
Based on the apparent eagerness to acquit the president, the GOP leadership in the Senate appears close to setting a precedent that such behavior would not be impeachable. It then could become difficult for anyone to claim that U.S. elections are "free and fair."

FLAWED DEFENSE ABUSE OF POWER IS A JUSTIFIABLE CHARGE

Texto completo: Dear Republican senators,
I will not try to convince you how to vote in the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump. I won't even lecture you about the need for witnesses, in part because by the time you see this it will probably be too late. My request is far more humble and possibly far more consequential: When you vote to acquit Mr. Trump of the charges leveled against him, please, please, forthrightly reject the central argument of Trump attorney Alan Dershowitz.
According to Mr. Dershowitz, "abuse of power" is not an impeachable act. Seriously. Any abuse of power that doesn't include a separate violation of criminal law is immune from impeachment, he contends. Indeed, any act - whether you call it abuse of power or corruption - is, for Mr. Dershowitz, fully within the president's constitutional ambit.
So a president who gets fall-down drunk every day and fails to fulfill the barest minimum of his duties cannot be impeached because getting drunk isn't a crime. Do you want to validate that nonsense?
I'm not picking that hypothetical out of the ether. During the Senate's Q&A session Wednesday night, Mr. Dershowitz told you the Senate's impeachment power over federal judges is different than that over presidents. Judges can be removed from the bench for violating the standard of "good behavior." So, Mr. Dershowitz conceded, if a judge gets fall-down drunk on the job, the Senate can remove him.
But, Mr. Dershowitz argued, the president doesn't serve only during "good behavior" because he is answerable to the voters.
It's an interesting distinction. The only problem: There's nothing in the Constitution to back him up. There's also nothing in the Constitution (or the Federalist Papers) to support the idea that so long as the president doesn't violate criminal law, he can't be impeached.
The standard response to this is: "What about the phrase 'High Crimes and Misdemeanors' in the Constitution?" The problem here, as most constitutional scholars will tell you, is that "High Crimes" doesn't just mean "violations of federal law." It would be weird if it did, given that when the Constitution was ratified there were no federal crimes, save for those mentioned in the Constitution (bribery, treason and piracy).
Alexander Hamilton, writing in Federalist 65, explained that High Crimes "are those offenses which proceed from the misconduct of public men, or, in other words, from the abuse or violation of some public trust." Presumably, refusing to attend meetings, sign legislation or conduct foreign policy because you were too busy doing keg stands in the Rose Garden would be a violation of the public trust.
Again, Mr. Dershowitz is almost completely alone among legal scholars alive today in making this argument. But he is not alone historically.
Mr. Dershowitz cites the legal arguments of Benjamin Curtis as a controlling precedent. Curtis was President Andrew Johnson's lawyer during his 1868 impeachment trial. Like Mr. Dershowitz, Curtis argued that mere abuse of power wasn't enough for a president to be impeached. The president needed to seriously violate the law.
Johnson avoided removal by one vote - and Yale law professor Bruce Ackerman persuasively argues that the one vote was secured at the last minute not through the power of Curtis' arguments but by naked bribery.
Regardless, because Johnson survived impeachment, Mr. Dershowitz has a lawyerly point. Curtis "won," so maybe his argument has precedential power after all.
If - and I should probably say "when" - you acquit the president, this precedent will gain even more power. And it is a terrible, dangerous, ridiculous precedent.
The president's strategy of completely stonewalling an impeachment inquiry has damaged congressional authority enough. There's no fixing the damage of that precedent now. But validating Mr. Dershowitz's claims would take a sledgehammer to the checks and balances at the heart of the impeachment power. Lending credence to the idea that presidents can literally do anything they want so long as they don't violate federal law would cover this Senate with shame.
Republican senators, I understand that you think it's necessary to acquit Mr. Trump. Fine. The least you could do is offer a resolution stating that Mr. Dershowitz's argument isn't the reason for your decision.

Texto completo: Event is part of UMF's Visiting Writers Series.
Free event is part of University of Maine at Farmington’s Visiting Writers Series
The University of Maine at Farmington’s Visiting Writers Series will open the new year with a talk by filmmaker and writer Caryn Waechter.
Waechter will discuss her work at 7:30 p.m., Thursday in The Landing in the Olsen Student Center on South Street of the UMF campus. The free event is sponsored by the UMF Bachelor of Fine Arts in Creative Writing program, according to a news release from UMF.
Waechter is a director and photographer based in Los Angeles. She is a graduate of Columbia University’s Master of Fine Arts film program where she concentrated in directing. Her first short film “BEAT,” shot guerilla-style on super 8 film in underground NYC clubs, marked her voice as “bold, mysterious and musically-driven,” according to the release.
Her awards include New Line Cinema Award for Best Director for “God is Good” and Best Female Director from Tangerine Entertainment for her directorial debut feature film “The Sisterhood of Night” (2015), produced by Lydia Dean Pilcher (“The Talented Mr. Ripley”) and starring Kal Penn (Harold & Kumar films), Georgie Henley (Narnia films), Kara Hayward (Moonrise Kingdom) and Olivia DeJonge (“The Visit”) about teenaged girls finding their way through the digital age.
On the day of its theatrical release, The New York Times raved: “Caryn Waechter, the director, is impressive here in her first feature.” Waechter is also a main contributor to Ridley Scott and Kevin Macdonald’s YouTube documentary “Life in a Day” (masterfully cut by Arrival’s editor Joe Walker), where her footage on one specific day was picked from 80,000 submissions and 4,500 hours, according to the release.
It premiered at the 2011 Sundance Film Festival, where she was invited to talk about her shooting process live on YouTube. Her footage was then used in Clint Eastwood’s 2012 Chrysler Super Bowl commercial “It’s Halftime in America.”
Once a trained ballet dancer, Waechter shoots and photographs EDM festivals and New York City’s underground nightlife. Her sophomore feature “DeadCon,” a horror film about the horrors and isolation of being a social media influencer, just came out on Netflix. It was produced by Hyde Park Entertainment and Gunpowder & Sky, according to the release.
Currently, Waechter has five projects in various stages of development.

Texto completo: Event is part of UMF's Visiting Writers Series.
Free event is part of University of Maine at Farmington’s Visiting Writers Series
The University of Maine at Farmington’s Visiting Writers Series will open the new year with a talk by filmmaker and writer Caryn Waechter.
Waechter will discuss her work at 7:30 p.m., Thursday in The Landing in the Olsen Student Center on South Street of the UMF campus. The free event is sponsored by the UMF Bachelor of Fine Arts in Creative Writing program, according to a news release from UMF.
Waechter is a director and photographer based in Los Angeles. She is a graduate of Columbia University’s Master of Fine Arts film program where she concentrated in directing. Her first short film “BEAT,” shot guerilla-style on super 8 film in underground NYC clubs, marked her voice as “bold, mysterious and musically-driven,” according to the release.
Her awards include New Line Cinema Award for Best Director for “God is Good” and Best Female Director from Tangerine Entertainment for her directorial debut feature film “The Sisterhood of Night” (2015), produced by Lydia Dean Pilcher (“The Talented Mr. Ripley”) and starring Kal Penn (Harold & Kumar films), Georgie Henley (Narnia films), Kara Hayward (Moonrise Kingdom) and Olivia DeJonge (“The Visit”) about teenaged girls finding their way through the digital age.
On the day of its theatrical release, The New York Times raved: “Caryn Waechter, the director, is impressive here in her first feature.” Waechter is also a main contributor to Ridley Scott and Kevin Macdonald’s YouTube documentary “Life in a Day” (masterfully cut by Arrival’s editor Joe Walker), where her footage on one specific day was picked from 80,000 submissions and 4,500 hours, according to the release.
It premiered at the 2011 Sundance Film Festival, where she was invited to talk about her shooting process live on YouTube. Her footage was then used in Clint Eastwood’s 2012 Chrysler Super Bowl commercial “It’s Halftime in America.”
Once a trained ballet dancer, Waechter shoots and photographs EDM festivals and New York City’s underground nightlife. Her sophomore feature “DeadCon,” a horror film about the horrors and isolation of being a social media influencer, just came out on Netflix. It was produced by Hyde Park Entertainment and Gunpowder & Sky, according to the release.
Currently, Waechter has five projects in various stages of development.

Texto completo: In a much-discussed New York Times Magazine essay, African American journalist Nikole Hannah-Jones explained the decision she and her husband made to enroll their 4-year-old in a high-poverty school rather than use their privilege to get her into a better-performing public school favored by the white parents gentrifying Brooklyn.
In response to critics who insisted she shouldn't sacrifice her child to a social justice agenda, Hannah-Jones asked a question that's become central to her work: "Whose children should be sacrificed?"
America's been all too willing to sacrifice its black and brown children, said Hannah-Jones, who spoke at a recent Georgia Budget & Policy Institute conference.
She cited the retreat from integrated schools and the rise of a "convenient"
narrative characterizing black Americans as less committed to education. That narrative ignores the African Americans who died for the offenses of learning to read or trying to send their children to public schools that they were supporting through their taxes, said Hannah-Jones, a founder of the Ida B. Wells Society for Investigative Reporting and recipient of a
MacArthur Genius grant. Court-ordered integration became personal for Americans at the schoolhouse door, said Hannah-Jones. "If I don't want to eat at a restaurant with black people, I just don't go. Schools are where civil rights become intimate."
It is easy to call out the racism of the 2017 Charlottesville march, she said. What's harder is decrying the racism in the middle-class white people who rally to stop their children from attending a school like her daughter's or protest new attendance lines that could bring more poor kids to their neighborhood school.
Such middle-class parents often contend minority families seeking to attend their schools "don't belong here because they are taking my tax dollars," said Hannah-Jones. "For the first 200 years of public education in America, black families were funding an education system for white families with nothing in return. Some might say the debt is owed in that way."
As a New York Times reporter focusing on racial injustice, Hannah-Jones created the 1619 Project, which reexamines America's origins and legacy of slavery and is being used as a curriculum now in some schools. She is at work on a book, "The Problem We All Live With," which chronicles the struggles of black Americans for access to equal education.
Her research has convinced her that America's return to segregated schools -- easily confirmed with a quick glance around metro Atlanta -- undermines any hope for an equal and just society.
Because, she said, school integration remains the surest route to academic achievement and social mobility. Under a voluntary desegregation program in her hometown in Iowa, Hannah-Jones traveled an hour across town to attend school in a whiter, richer area starting in second grade. She described the experience as "emotionally and socially fraught, but also as academically stimulating and world-expanding."
In the 2019 book "Children of the Dream: Why School Integration Works," economist Rucker C. Johnson of the University of California, Berkeley, tracked black students who attended integrated schools into adulthood. He found integration significantly increased their educational and career attainments, their college quality and earnings, reduced the probability of incarceration, and improved their health outcomes. And those benefits were passed onto their children.
"We have one tool that we know works and won't use it," Hannah-Jones said. It works far better than charter schools and vouchers, which she contends represent new paths to segregation.
(Hannah-Jones found agreement from Early County Superintendent Bronwyn Ragan-Martin, who, on a panel later with the journalist, said, "Charter schools in South Georgia are basically moving us back to segregation.")
Those who see integration as a failure often do so because test scores didn't surge, but Hannah-Jones calls scores a meaningless gauge. "I am 43 years old. No one gives a damn what I scored on a test in third grade," she said.
Looking beyond test scores to life outcomes, black students who attended integrated schools come out better on most measures, she said.
Why? According to Johnson's research, integrated schools provided black students with such advantages as reduced class sizes and increases in per-pupil spending.
As Justice Thurgood Marshall wrote in his dissent of a 1974 Supreme Court decision, "If the majority is educating its children and making sure every benefit is available, then minority children can also get those benefits if they can attend those schools."
"Show me a place where it is not true that black kids and white kids in separate schools get different resources. ... Segregated schools equal segregated life," said Hannah-Jones.
She shared the story of a teenage girl who was an honor student, athlete and homecoming queen at her segregated Tuscaloosa high school. Like other school districts in the South, Tuscaloosa resegregated once released from court-enforced integration.
"D'Leisha would be considered an all-American girl," said Hannah-Jones, "except we don't call little black girls from the poor side of town with an apostrophe in their names all-American girls."
D'Leisha didn't earn admission into her dream college, the University of Alabama, never scoring the requisite 23 on the ACT. Her high school preparation did not include the expansive advanced classes available in whiter schools. Nor did the school have a student newspaper or yearbook, said Hannah-Jones.

Texto completo: New allegations of sexual misconduct have surfaced at Victoria's Secret as the brand tries to remake its image after years of scandal and slumping sales.
Female models and executives were bullied and harassed for decades at the lingerie chain, evidence of an "entrenched culture of misogyny," according to a New York Times investigation published this weekend.
The revelations come days after reports that L Brands Inc., owner of the troubled retailer as well as Bath & Body Works, was in talks to break up the company and that longtime Chief Executive Les Wexner could step down.

The allegations, coupled with criticism of the brand's marketing and lingering questions around the company's relationship with the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, continue to erode Victoria's Secret's chances to rebound as it faces rising competition.
The culture at Victoria's Secret was presided over by Ed Razek, the company's controversial former chief marketing officer, as well as Wexner, according to interviews the Times conducted with more than 30 current and former executives, models and others, and from documents including court filings.
Razek didn't immediately respond to a voicemail request for comment.
In a statement, independent directors on the L Brands board said the company is making strides in ensuring a safe workplace, and it has in recent years adopted "more robust anti-harassment policies, hotline reporting, and training."
Victoria's Secret has for years been criticized for promoting models of a certain body type, while consumers have demanded more diversity, as well as themes of female empowerment.
Wexner has since expressed regret over his association with Epstein, who in years past had served as his money manager. Epstein killed himself inside his jail cell in August as he was awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges.
"Everyone has to feel enormous regret from the advantage that was taken of so many young women," Wexner said of Epstein at a September investor meeting in Columbus, Ohio. "That's just unexplainable abhorrent behavior and clearly something we all would condemn."
L Brands shares fell as much as 3.2% on Monday in New York.
Last July, L Brands said it hired an external law firm to investigate any ties between the company and Epstein.
Wexner's relationship with him ended 13 years ago, and the company doesn't believe Epstein was ever formally employed by Victoria's Secret.
In August, more than 100 models signed an open letter to Victoria's Secret CEO John Mehas calling for him to protect models against sexual harassment and assault.

Would Your Pay Rise Under 'Medicare for All'? It Depends on the Labor Market

Texto completo: Research suggests the answer is yes, but not in all cases, and with significant differences across jobs and labor markets.
Hidden in the larger debate over "Medicare for all" is a fundamental economic question: Who pays for work-based health insurance?
For the 157 million Americans who get health insurance through their work -- or through the job of a spouse or parent -- the answer may seem obvious, evident right on pay stubs. Employers pay most of it, and workers pay some.
Last year, work-based coverage per person cost $ 7,188, with employees directly contributing 18 percent on average. Family coverage cost $ 20,576, of which employees paid 30 percent.
But what seems obvious isn't always what's correct. Regardless of what's on your pay stub, many health economists believe that your employer's contribution toward health insurance comes out of your wages.
So will Medicare for all cause wages to rise if employers have to spend less on benefits? Research suggests the answer is "yes," with the caveat that it may not be matched dollar for dollar for everyone. The precise relationship depends on the nature of the labor market, which varies across markets and jobs.
The economic theory that explains why employees foot the bill for health insurance is this: Whether it's in dollars or health insurance, what matters to workers is the total value of their compensation for work. (There are other workplace benefits, but none anywhere near as costly and important as wages and health insurance.)
In a competitive and fluid labor market -- where there are many similar employers and workers, and little difficulty in hiring or switching jobs -- an employer that tries to undercut the prevailing market rate risks losing workers to competitors. Likewise, a worker who demands more could well be passed over for another who will accept the prevailing rate for total compensation.
"Yes, an individual worker might get a little more or less than market compensation from time to time," said Steven Pizer, a health economist at the Boston University School of Public Health. "But if employment is fluid, there's just no way, according to the theory, for that to happen consistently."
One option under Senator Bernie Sanders's Medicare for all plan would reduce employer spending on health insurance by $ 9,000 per employee and raise taxes on the wealthy. Senator Elizabeth Warren's plan would also raise taxes on the wealthy, but would aim to tax employers an amount intended to match what they would have spent on health care anyway.
In a Democratic debate in September, Mr. Sanders differed with Joe Biden in saying wages would rise if employers were no longer involved with health benefits. Many Americans are skeptical; in a Kaiser Family Foundation poll, 63 percent said their wages would stay the same if their employers' health costs fell.
Some studies in economics support the theory that employers trade off health insurance premiums for wages almost dollar for dollar. A study in the Southern Economics Journal examined salary and benefits data from the New York Department of Education in the 1970s. Controlling for confounding factors like teaching experience, education, school budget and other benefits, the study found that a dollar increase in the value of health benefits was associated with an 83-cent reduction in salary on average.
But other studies of public-sector employees find little to no evidence of a comparable trade-off between wages and health insurance premiums. One, in the Journal of Health Economics and based on data from over 6,000 school districts, found that a dollar increase in benefits was associated with a reduction in wages and salaries of only 15 cents.
Another from the same journal, in which the Harvard health economist Michael Chernew is a co-author, used national surveys of public-sector workers and employers' data and produced similar findings.
Why might premium and wage changes not perfectly offset each other in public-sector jobs? One possibility is unionization, which is more likely in the public than in the private sector. Unionized workers are better able to bargain for higher compensation than individual workers, who are more easily let go and replaced with others. Negotiated contracts could end up with health insurance benefits increasing without offsetting reductions in salary.
"One reason unionized public-sector workers may be unwilling to fully pay for premium increases with reduced wages is that the higher premiums reflect things they do not fully value," Mr. Chernew said. "For example, workers may not be willing to sacrifice already low wages for higher health care prices that don't reflect better health care."
So much for the public sector; what about the private one? Here, many studies suggest closer to a one-to-one trade-off between workplace health insurance premiums and wages. Some of these studies focus on specific benefits, like maternity care, or on different populations, like those with obesity, finding that their higher costs to employers are offset by lower wages.
Other studies examine broader markets. A study in the Journal of Health Economics looked at what happened in Massachusetts after it enacted an employer health insurance mandate in 2006. It found that the $ 6,100 annual employer cost of coverage was nearly perfectly offset by lower wages. Another study in the Journal of Labor Economics found that married women with workplace health insurance coverage have wages that are lower by about the same amount as their employers pay for that coverage, relative to married women with no such coverage option.
Nevertheless, even in the private sector, there are exceptions, with some studies finding that health care costs for workers are not always perfectly offset by wages. Just as in the public sector, this could happen if the labor market is not perfectly competitive. For instance, to the extent workers cannot find other jobs, they may be forced to pay more for their benefits, either through rising premiums without more pay to compensate for it, or through greater cost sharing.
In other cases, some firms may incur higher health care costs that they cannot pass along to workers without losing them to competitors. Much of the increase in health care costs is due to price growth, perhaps without a commensurate increase in the benefits of care.
"Employees won't value higher prices without increased benefits," said Jeannie Fuglesten Biniek, a health economist and senior researcher at the Health Care Cost Institute. "In such cases, employers will be unable to pass along the full increase in health care costs to workers."
The wage issue is just one of the trade-offs involved with Medicare for all; there are also healthy debates about how much taxes would rise and how much costs would fall.
Ultimately, someone would have to pay for Medicare for all, so not everyone would be better off. But to the extent the cost of health insurance is shifted away from employers and to the federal government under Medicare for all, it seems wages would rise, at least for some people.

DES MOINES -- Across the face of Todd Bratten crept the queasy expression of a person trying to utter a word he does not know how to pronounce.
"Oh, I'll take a stab," he said, moments before boarding a plane in Atlanta. "BUTT-i-judge?"
It has been many months since former Mayor Pete Buttigieg (pronounced BOOT-edge-edge) of South Bend, Ind., announced that he was considering running for president, many months since Chris Wallace called him "Pete BOOT-i-jadge" on Fox News, and many months since the public was introduced to the name's confounding sequence of G's and unusual (unless you are from Malta) configuration of vowels.
You would think that voters would get it by now. But when The New York Times posted an online quiz in December testing respondents' ability to recognize public figures from their photographs, less than one third of those who successfully identified Mr. Buttigieg were able to spell his name correctly.
Although misspellings were not unusual in the survey -- someone wrote "Beonyce" for Beyoncé, for instance -- Buttigieg generated an impressive 167 variations, suggesting that whatever the respondents thought the name was, maybe by reverse-engineering what they thought it sounded like, they were wrong.
Some people appeared to conflate him with the head coach of the New England Patriots ("Bodicheck"); others had perhaps seen the campaign's pronunciation tips and were trying to remember what they were ("Butedgedge") and still others clearly knew that the name was full of vowels, but were unsure which ones, or where to put them ("Boudeguege").
Even those who can't pronounce Buttigieg have mostly kept the name in stride. One exception is President Trump, who has used the name to taunt the mayor at rallies.
"They say EDGE-EDGE," he declared last May in a tone of "Can you believe this?" incredulity, overstressing the syllables as if they were alien concepts. "He's got a great chance, doesn't he? He'll be great."
He returned to the topic in December, before that month's Democratic presidential debate. It is worth pointing out that his own pronunciations were generally successful.
"Who wants to watch BOOT-ed-edge?" he asked rhetorically. "BOOT-ed-jedge. BOOT-edge-edge! You know that you pronounce it, I heard some guy say, no, no, 'cause it's an unpronounceable name. That's why they call him" -- here the president shifted the timbre of his voice, as if he were speaking in italics -- "Mayor Pete. Mayor Pete. Mayor Pete!" He pointed to a place in the middle of his chest. "I've had you up to here, Mayor Pete."
Mr. Buttigieg himself has never seemed to mind that it is hard, without outside help, to get his name right. Instead, he uses it as a way to talk about his Maltese origins -- his father was originally from Malta -- and to convey his folksy accessibility.
"Most people have trouble pronouncing my name, so they just call me Mayor Pete," he wrote in 2016. The campaign has made a virtue of the confusion, printing its go-to phonetic aide-mémoire -- BOOT-edge-edge -- on T-shirts.
Confusingly, Chasten, the candidate's husband, has muddied the waters a bit by offering some alternatives on Twitter ("Buddha-judge," "Boot-a-judge" and "Boot-uh-judge"), suggesting that there is no Platonic ideal of pronunciation.
On Monday, caucusgoers who want to support Mr. Buttigieg will not be required to say his name out loud -- all they have to do is stand in his corner with other like-minded voters -- and thus will not have to risk public pronunciation embarrassment.
Even given what appears to be room to maneuver, many potential voters still grow visibly nervous when required to use the word out loud.
A brief, unscientific survey at Newark and Atlanta airports between legs of a flight to Iowa the other day revealed as many different permutations of Buttigieg as there were travelers willing to answer questions at a boarding gate.
"BOOT-i-gee," Mohammed Irfan, 50, declared confidently. Then he lost his nerve. "I don't know. BOOT-i-jed? BOOT-eh-jed?"
"BUTT-i-gig," said a woman laden with carry-on bags, revealing only her first name (Judy) and her age (75). "BUTT-i-veg," said her husband, who declined to identify himself, for fear of looking foolish.
Last March, Aaron Nemo, an associate producer for CBS's "The Late Show With Stephen Colbert," took it upon himself to make a Buttigieg-pronunciation video.
The video repeatedly uses visual aids -- a boot and two cliff edges -- to illustrate its point.
"It's not Pete Badger-judge," Mr. Nemo raps. "It's not Pete Boat-tea-church. It's not Pete Bowling-Jewish. It's not Pete Bush-toe- (gargling noise)." And: "It's not Pete Davidson. That's a different guy!"
"What I found amusing was the wide variance in the mispronunciations -- how many different ways people were absolutely mutilating his name, sometimes not even getting a single syllable correct," Mr. Nemo said via email.
Back at the Atlanta airport, Mr. Bratten, the man who did his best, said that "Mayor Pete" was a great solution for people rendered nervous by the word Buttigieg.
"It has a warm, cozy feel to it," he said. "Though I think it's going to be a stretch to get from Mayor Pete to President Pete." An Iowa event showed the right pronunciation of Pete Buttigieg's surname. (It's not "BUTT-i-veg," "BOOT-i-gee" or "Badger-judge.") (PHOTOGRAPH BY TAMIR KALIFA FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES)

Texto completo: The new streaming service HBO Max will carry "On the Record" after Oprah Winfrey's decision to back out amid a pressure campaign by the hip-hop impresario.
A documentary about the women who have accused Russell Simmons of sexual misconduct has found itself a new home after its original backers, Oprah Winfrey and Apple's streaming service, dropped the film last month amid a pressure campaign by the hip-hop mogul.
The film, "On the Record," will appear on HBO Max, the new streaming service from Warner Media set to launch in May, the company said in a news release on Monday.
The announcement comes just over a week after the film debuted to glowing early reviews at the Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah, in January, and close to a month after Ms. Winfrey removed herself as executive producer of the film and took her distribution partner, Apple TV Plus, with her.
"On the Record" tells the story of the music executive Drew Dixon and her decision, in the early weeks of the #MeToo movement, to publicly accuse Mr. Simmons of raping her. (Her account of the 1995 encounter was first reported in The New York Times in 2017.)
Kirby Dick and Amy Ziering, two documentarians whose previous work has focused on sexual assault in the military ("The Invisible War") and on college campuses ("The Hunting Ground"), tracked Ms. Dixon's journey along with those of other women who accused Mr. Simmons of sexual misconduct, including Sil Lai Abrams, Sheri Hines, Jenny Lumet and Alexia Norton Jones. The film also addresses the various cultural forces that have prevented black women from reporting sex crimes. Mr. Simmons, who has not been charged with a crime, has maintained that he did not sexually assault anyone.
"The fierce determination of Drew Dixon and all of the women who bravely chose to share their stories in 'On The Record' moved us profoundly," Sarah Aubrey, the head of original content at HBO Max, said in a statement. "I've been impressed with Amy and Kirby's work over the years covering this complex subject matter, and look forward to this film finding the widest possible audience."
"On the Record" will receive at least a one-week theatrical release to qualify it for Oscar consideration, but the date of its opening in theaters or on HBO Max has not yet been determined.
Accepted into Sundance at the beginning of December, "On the Record" was one of the most anticipated documentaries at the festival. But its future became muddied when Winfrey announced her exit from the project at the beginning of the year, citing "creative differences" with the filmmakers. She later revealed, in an interview with The New York Times, that she had been pressured by Mr. Simmons to withdraw.
Ms. Winfrey said that Mr. Simmons had no role in her exit. "I told him directly in a phone call that I will not be pressured either into, or out of, backing this film," she said. "I am only going to do what I believe to be the right thing."
Rather, she said that she believed the film had not adequately addressed inconsistencies in Ms. Dixon's account, although Ms. Winfrey said she still believed Ms. Dixon. She also said the documentary had not done enough to tackle the misogyny within the broader hip-hop culture at the time Ms. Dixon was active in the industry.
The filmmakers said they had addressed all of Ms. Winfrey's concerns.
"Kirby and I are so proud to be teaming with HBO Max to give this film the outstanding platform it deserves and can't wait for the public to see and hear the voices of these courageous women," Ms. Ziering said in a statement.

Texto completo: While the final results of the Iowa caucuses were unclear, there was no shortage of drama inside the Johnston Middle School gymnasium.
JOHNSTON, Iowa -- For weeks undecided Iowans have been saying that they may make their decision based on the last candidate they see in person. On Monday night, that sentiment paid off for Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota at Johnston Middle School.
The senator was a surprise guest at the Johnston 2 precinct, popping in just after the caucus began to make one final pitch to the more than 350 attendees.
"The most important thing is that we win in the general election," she said, adding that if she was the nominee, the party would rebuild the "blue wall" that President Trump had cracked in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin in 2016. "We'll make Donald Trump pay for it," she added.
While the final results were unclear, there was no shortage of drama inside the middle school gymnasium, where each of the campaigns staked out room on the yellow bleachers. A handful of undecided Democrats were swarmed by the precinct captains of the most competitive campaigns, who were charged with lobbying people to back their candidate.
Ms. Klobuchar came here because Johnston is a Des Moines suburb that flipped from Republican to Democratic in 2018. It is filled with the sort of moderate Democrats and Republicans she is banking on to support her. Joseph R. Biden Jr., the former vice president, was also counting on support from those same Democrats, but the results of the first alignment were disappointing for him.
"I wish there was a way to tell who is undecided," said Gregory Davis, a retired Lutheran minister who served as Ms. Klobuchar's precinct captain.
As caucusgoers trickled in, the most organized campaigns scurried to track who was showing up. Rhonda Gooding and Lara McAdams, the precinct captains for Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., combed through their lists and called supporters who they had not seen.
Over in the section reserved for Biden supporters, the precinct captain Penny Schempp began to get nervous. She had far less than 15 percent of the room, meaning that without an infusion of Biden supporters he would not reach viability -- forcing his group to make their second choice.
As Ms. Schempp fretted, a supporter of Andrew Yang, an entrepreneur, came by to lobby her to switch to the rookie candidate.
"I just need to have someone with experience in government," Ms. Schempp said. The Yang supporter replied that Mr. Biden was responsible for the impeachment inquiry into Mr. Trump.
"He shouldn't have gotten his son that job for $ 50,000 per month," the Yang supporter, who declined to give her name, added. But her argument fell flat.
The first alignment results were indeed bad for Mr. Biden here. With 37 supporters, he fell far short of the 54 caucusgoers required to reach the 15 percent threshold.
Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont won the first alignment with 76 supporters, followed by Ms. Klobuchar with 75. Mr. Buttigieg had 70 and Ms. Warren 59.
Mr. Yang, who had 33, and the billionaire Tom Steyer and Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, who had four each, also failed to reach viability.
Then came the realignment, a frenetic 15-minute period that saw the viable candidates' supporters swarm like vultures into the sections reserved for Biden and Yang supporters.
But not everybody picked a second choice. About half of the Yang group walked out. Some Biden backers did, too.
Melanie Weatherall, a 50-year-old nurse who wore a blue sequined dress with BIDEN in sparkly letters across the back, refused to realign to another candidate when he was not viable.
"Nobody else can beat Trump," she said. "They said we should go to Amy, but what is the point? They're going to mess it up when they can't beat Trump."
In the end, Ms. Klobuchar picked up the vast majority of Biden supporters here -- adding 31 to her total in the realignment. Her new supporters included Ms. Schempp, the Biden precinct captain, and Greg McCabe, a 76-year-old retiree who said Ms. Klobuchar was his second choice all along.
"I like Amy's integrity," he said. "I only backed Biden because I thought he would be better at foreign relations."
Ms. Klobuchar's 106 supporters were more than enough to win the precinct. Mr. Sanders, who had the most after the first alignment, placed second with 83, followed by Mr. Buttigieg with 81 and Ms. Warren, who did not win any new supporters in the realignment. She finished with 59.

Operations, Covert and Overt, at the Super Bowl

Texto completo: J. Lo wore a Puerto Rican flag. Children appeared in orbs that looked like cages. Beyoncé and Jay-Z sat during the national anthem. Were they all saying something?
Were Beyoncé and Jay-Z making a political statement when they sat during the national anthem? Was Jennifer Lopez alluding to President Trump's immigration practices by having children sitting in cage-like orbs? What about that Puerto Rican flag?
At the Super Bowl, the most widely viewed television event of the year, political statements from international superstars can be only so overt. And since representatives for the three celebrities didn't respond to questions about the meaning, if any, behind the gestures, viewers rushed in to fill the void with speculation.
Jay-Z and Beyoncé were not part of the televised presentation during Demi Lovato's singing of "The Star-Spangled Banner." The celebrity news website TMZ obtained a video of the two of them, along with their daughter Blue Ivy, seated during the song while most everyone else around them was standing.
The royal couple of hip-hop were not ignoring the song; both appeared to be swaying to it. But given the circumstances of Jay-Z's partnership with the National Football League, many readers wondered whether their attachment to their seats was part of some message. One conservative author and pundit, Nick Adams, called it a "disgusting act of shame" on Twitter; others wondered whether it was all a manufactured fuss.
The N.F.L. entered a partnership with Jay-Z as a way to smooth over the rough edges left by the league's battle with Colin Kaepernick, the former quarterback whose kneeling during the national anthem touched off a nationwide debate over free speech, patriotism and the treatment of black Americans. The deal called for Jay-Z and his company, Roc Nation, to consult on live entertainment, including the halftime show, and for the music impresario to contribute to a league social-justice campaign called "Inspire Change."
Jay-Z had supported Kaepernick's protest, but received some flak from those who saw his cooperation with the N.F.L. as betraying Kaepernick's cause. In a recent interview with The New York Times, Jay-Z said that he "can take a couple rounds of negative press" if it meant the deal could help convince white football fans that they should be concerned with police treatment of African-Americans.
Beyoncé herself used the Super Bowl platform to make a statement even before Kaepernick began kneeling. In 2016, her performance of "Formation" during the halftime show in Santa Clara, Calif., was replete with black pride imagery -- featuring costumes reminiscent of Black Panther attire -- and carried an implicit message about police shootings.
David M. Carter, an associate professor of sports business at the University of Southern California, said that entertainers see the Super Bowl as a platform to communicate -- but any political messages tend to be toned down because of the multitude of corporate interests involved.
But many hard-core football fans have gotten used to the injections of political messaging in the games, he said. Their reactions tend to be "somewhere between fatigue and an eye roll," Carter said.
It would also have been easy to miss the possible political symbolism in J. Lo and Shakira's halftime show with its explosion of hip gyrations, pole dancing and Latin rhythms. But more than 10 minutes into the show, the cameras pulled back to reveal a more tranquil scene: children, dressed in white, sitting beneath lit-up structures that looked a bit like tulips with their petals closed. Some viewers interpreted the structures as representing children in cages, a reference to the Trump's administration's practice of detaining migrant children separately from their parents.
Then, as the music transitioned to a brief sampling from Bruce Springsteen's "Born in the U.S.A.," Lopez reappeared wearing a feathery floor-length jacket bearing the Puerto Rican flag on one side and the American flag on the other. Lopez shouted "Latinos!" before sharing a moment with a young vocalist (who happened to be her daughter, Emme Maribel Muñiz) and breaking out a salsa step.
Lopez, who was born in the Bronx to Puerto Rican parents and has family on the Caribbean island, has been an outspoken advocate for Puerto Ricans since the island was devastated by Hurricanes Irma and Maria in 2017. The pop star donated $ 1 million to the relief effort and visited the island a few months later, saying that Puerto Ricans "just want to be treated equally" as Americans.
The Puerto Rican flag lasted only a few seconds on the Super Bowl stage: J. Lo quickly shed the dual-flag jacket and strutted forward to finish the show in her sparkling silver jumpsuit. A representative for Lopez declined to comment on whether the symbols were intended to be political statements.
Twitter users did not decline to comment.
One moment during the Super Bowl package was more intentional in its messaging. In a commercial from the "Inspire Change" initiative, the retired football player Anquan Boldin recounted the night that his cousin, Corey Jones, who is black, was fatally shot by a plainclothes police officer while awaiting help along a highway in Florida. (The officer was convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to 25 years in prison.) The minute-long commercial touched on some of the causes that "Inspire Change" promotes: economic advancement, police relations with the community and criminal justice reform.

The Democrats knew they would probably never get the Senate votes to oust President Trump. Their goal was to use the impeachment process to expose corruption in the Trump administration. Mission accomplished -- and with an unexpected bonus.
The impeachment hearings showed that the Republican Congress is totally subservient to Donald Trump and willing to stomp on the Constitution. No one will forget that performance. It won't take much to flip the Senate to the Democrats in 2020.
Mr. Trump and his accomplices have shown that they are self-serving, dishonest and unfit for public office. And there is likely even more evidence ahead. The "drip, drip" of new information will continue to leak, including how Republicans rig elections.
So it's "Game On" for the 2020 election. The Democrats have handed Mr. Trump plenty to worry about.
Just as Nancy Pelosi planned.

Let's face reality: After what happened on Friday -- with the Senate abasing itself utterly by refusing to call witnesses -- President Trump's address Tuesday night should be called "The State of the Kingdom."

To the Editor:
When Alan Dershowitz stood before the Senate and said that whatever a president might do in seeking re-election could not be considered impeachable, I would have expected that at least a few senators might have thrown their milk at him before walking out in protest. None did. No Senate Republican dismissed this notion of an unchecked executive as a dangerous, tyrannical idea.
I taught American history and government for 20 years. I always reminded my students that the Constitution, however ingenious its construction, was mere words on paper. Most countries have nice constitutions filled with glorious language. I taught my students that Americans always needed to defend and strengthen the principles and ideals of our system or we could lose them.
Congress is filled with cowardly Republicans, terrified of President Trump and his Twitter fingers, comfortable with the notion of a president who cares for nothing but his personal gain. I had been hoping that Republicans would finally stand up and put country before party. But watching this trial in the Senate has kicked the hope right out of me.

To the Editor:
Re "A Party Now Less Likely to Tell Trump 'Enough"' ("Trump on Trial" series, front page, Feb. 1):
Carl Hulse asks if G.O.P. senators will ever say "enough" when it comes to President Trump and his ostensibly wrongful behavior. Well, it appears that Republican senators have indeed said "enough," not with respect to Mr. Trump's behavior, but rather with the shameful behavior of the Democrats and their handmaidens in the liberal media. They've said "enough" with the endless stunts and manufactured scandals designed to remove Mr. Trump from office. They've said "enough" with the half-baked plots to overturn the results of the 2016 election.
From faithless electors, the emoluments clause, Russian collusion, the 25th Amendment and obstruction of justice to the Ukraine impeachment scam, the left has deployed one cockamamie scheme after another to dislodge Mr. Trump from the presidency. The whole puerile process reminds me of the old Wile E. Coyote/Road Runner cartoon, with Road Runner eluding the coyote at the end of each episode.
At this point, there are a lot of people who are saying "enough." Because enough is enough.

To the Editor:
Assuming an acquittal, I would urge the House managers to propose censuring the president for his actions. It is a fallback, but it is something. If successful, it might serve to address the concerns about "inappropriate behavior" some Republicans, in addition to Senator Lamar Alexander, might harbor. It would also help to caution against future bad behavior regarding both election interference and the balance of power.

Apparently Donald Trump can sit in an office on Pennsylvania Avenue and shoot holes in the Constitution and not lose voters in the Senate.

Texto completo: Liam Scarlett is accused of inappropriate conduct with students at the company's school.
LONDON -- The Royal Ballet has suspended Liam Scarlett, its artist-in-residence, after accusations of sexual misconduct involving students at the Royal Ballet School.
The company was made aware of the accusations against Mr. Scarlett in August, it said in an emailed statement on Thursday. Mr. Scarlett was suspended immediately and an investigation is ongoing, the statement added.
The accusations were first reported by The Times of London on Wednesday night.
Mr. Scarlett, who was heralded as a "choreographic wonder boy of British ballet," has created work for the New York City Ballet, American Ballet Theater and Miami City Ballet, among others.
The impact of the accusations is already spreading beyond Britain. On Thursday, the Queensland Ballet in Australia suspended Mr. Scarlett, an artistic associate of the company, and canceled its planned productions of his ballet "Dangerous Liaisons," The Australian newspaper reported.
According to The Times of London, Mr. Scarlett, 33, is accused of inappropriate behavior with male students at the school, including encouraging them to send him nude photos.
Citing anonymous sources, the newspaper said the Royal Ballet's inquiry heard that dancers who accepted Mr. Scarlett's advances, or didn't complain about them, were given better roles.
The Times of London also said it had spoken with a former student who said Mr. Scarlett shared "sexual messages" with him through Facebook. The student was 18 at the time, two years above the age of consent in Britain, the newspaper said.
"I'm speaking out because he should not be allowed to continue working with students," the dancer, who was not named, said, according to the newspaper.
The Times of London also said the inquiry was also looking at accusations that Mr. Scarlett bullied dancers in the Royal Ballet's main company.
Mr. Scarlett's agent did not respond to requests for a comment on Thursday.
The accusations are the latest sexual misconduct scandal to hit the ballet world. In 2017, Marcelo Gomes resigned from the American Ballet Theater after he was accused of sexual misconduct. Just months later, Peter Martins, the leader of New York City Ballet, retired after accusations of abuse were made against him. (A company investigation did not corroborate the accusations, which Mr. Martins denied.)
Last year, an arbitrator ordered New York City Ballet to reinstate two male dancers it had fired after they were accused of sharing sexually explicit photos of female dancers.
"It's embarrassing that after all these allegations around the world nothing seems to have been done about such behavior," said Jonathan Gray, editor of Dancing Times, in a telephone interview.
The accusations against Mr. Scarlett had been known about in London ballet circles "for several months," Mr. Gray said, but he had not expected the news to become public until the investigation was completed.
The news was embarrassing for the Royal Ballet, he said, but it was also potentially "a really big problem for the Royal Ballet School," he added, if it turns out the school had allowed students to come into contact with someone accused of misbehavior.
"We became aware this week that the investigation into Liam Scarlett may relate to some of our former pupils," the Royal Ballet School said in a statement on Thursday. "We will, of course, be offering our full cooperation to the investigation team, but since the inquiry is still underway we are unable to comment further at this stage."
Mr. Scarlett attended the school from age 11, graduating into the Royal Ballet in 2005. His choreographic breakthrough came just five years later with "Asphodel Meadows," which played on the Royal Opera House's main stage. Reviewing the work in The Guardian, the dance critic Judith Mackrell said that "In Liam Scarlett, the Royal may have found the real deal."
Mr. Scarlett was just 24 at the time; commissions from the Miami City Ballet and other companies soon followed.
He became the Royal Ballet's first artist-in-residence in 2012, allowing him to concentrate full-time on choreography, and he has had a string of hits since, most notably in 2018, when he made a "Swan Lake" for the company.
Last May, the Royal Ballet announced a new work by Mr. Scarlett would receive its world premiere in February 2020. That production was postponed in August, the same month Mr. Scarlett was suspended.
But other works by Mr. Scarlett are scheduled to be performed at the Royal Opera House soon. The Royal Ballet is set to perform his "Swan Lake" -- which Roslyn Sulcas, writing in The New York Times, called "respectful, tasteful" -- from March 5 through May 16. The entire run is sold out. It is also set to perform a triple bill including a work by Mr. Scarlett in June.

Texto completo: The changes come two months after a hedge fund once called "the destroyer of newspapers" bought a 32 percent stake in the company, which owns The Chicago Tribune and other newspapers.
Tribune Publishing, the owner of The Chicago Tribune, announced a management shake-up on Monday, naming Terry Jimenez, its chief financial officer, as the chief executive. He succeeds Timothy P. Knight, who will step down after only a year leading the company.
The changes come two months after Alden Global Capital, a New York hedge fund once called "a destroyer of newspapers," acquired the single largest stake in the company and installed two of eight directors on the board. Tribune Publishing has already been cutting staff, eliminating 118 posts through September. Last month, the company asked journalists at its nine news organizations across the country to volunteer for buyouts.
Tribune Publishing, which also owns The New York Daily News, The Baltimore Sun and The Orlando Sentinel, has been hit hard by elemental changes to the news business as readers embrace screens for their news, and Facebook and Google siphon away the majority of digital ad dollars.
In a memo to staff on Monday, Mr. Knight said the company would have to continue to "realign" its "costs to the current revenue reality," adding: "These efforts will allow the company to focus resources on our employees and the journalism you produce."
Mr. Knight, who had spent several decades in the news business, said he was "looking forward to finding a new adventure."
Employees represented by the union at The Baltimore Sun had sharp words for company executives.
"The cuts being made are only necessary to pad unrealistic profit expectations on Wall Street," the union said on Twitter in a response to the management changes. "We need to see new leadership better explain how a strategy of cutting to the bone to please Wall Street squares with plans 'to invest in quality, local journalism."'
Alden Global owns 32 percent of Tribune Publishing and agreed to steer clear of management or personnel matters for the time being. But insiders are wary. Alden, known for gutting newsrooms to improve profits, could buy more stock as soon as July.
The fear of the hedge fund has so gripped The Chicago Tribune's journalists that two of its reporters last month approached several billionaires to be potential white knights and buy the company to fend off Alden.
"Now, we are bracing for the sight of colleagues with decades of experience walking out with cardboard boxes in their arms and tears streaming down their faces," David Jackson and Gary Marx, reporters at The Chicago Tribune, wrote in an Op-Ed for The New York Times last month.
Mr. Jimenez, who had been finance chief since 2016, has spent several years working at news publishers, including a stint Newsday and several years as publisher of amNewYork, a free daily paper.

Texto completo: A film starring Jodie Foster is airing. And President Trump delivers his third State of the Union Address.
What's on TV
CONTACT (1997) 7 p.m. on Ovation. Based on the 1985 science-fiction novel of the same title by Carl Sagan, "Contact" yearns to bridge the gap between humanity and technological advancement. Jodie Foster plays Ellie Arroway, a scientist devoted to finding extraterrestrial life, who picks up a radio signal from another planet. This garners national attention, and as Ellie decodes the aliens' message, she must protect her work from those trying to steal or discount it. Ellie and a young minister named Palmer Joss (Matthew McConaughey) engage in a debate throughout over science and religion -- and Palmer also becomes a love interest. "But try as it might to convey a humanist, mystical message and to equate the search for extraterrestrial life with religious faith," Stephen Holden wrote in his review for The New York Times, "'Contact' is much more convincing when worshiping at the cold shrine of technology."
STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS 8 p.m. on CNN; 9 p.m. on CBS, ABC, NBC and FOX. President Trump will deliver his third State of the Union Address -- the last of this presidential term. Mr. Trump's first State of the Union Address focused on immigration policy, and his second -- which was rescheduled because of a government shutdown over funding for a border wall -- touched on looming Congressional investigations into his conduct. This year, the speech comes a day ahead of a final vote on his impeachment.
What's Streaming
TOM PAPA: YOU'RE DOING GREAT! Stream on Netflix. The film, TV, radio and podcast comedian Tom Papa makes his Netflix debut with an hourlong routine filmed in his home state, New Jersey. In this special, Papa covers life's simple pleasures: getting married, having two daughters, and living with the notion of being a parent. With asides about pets, climate change, social media and Staten Island, Papa assures viewers that we're all just doing our best.
BRIDGET JONES'S DIARY (2001) Stream on Hulu. Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. If Bridget Jones just loses 20 pounds and cuts down on alcohol, cigarettes and carbs, she'll probably find (and land) the man of her dreams. At least, that's her hope. Luckily, her current suitors -- her charming boss, Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant), and her former childhood friend, the earnest Mark Darcy (Colin Firth) -- assure our heroine that they like her for exactly who she is. Renée Zellweger, who adopts an unassuming British accent to play Bridget, was nominated for an Academy Award for her role. "Ms. Zellweger accomplishes the small miracle of making Bridget both entirely endearing and utterly real," Stephen Holden wrote in his review for The Times. The movie's sequels, BRIDGET JONES: THE EDGE OF REASON (2004) and BRIDGET JONES'S BABY (2016), will also be available for streaming.

Iowa Counties Struggle to Use App to Report Results, Contributing to Long Waits

Texto completo: The state Democratic Party cited "quality control" checks on the data as the reason for delays in reporting the Democratic presidential caucus results.
DES MOINES -- Results from the Iowa caucuses were significantly delayed on Monday night, with campaigns expressing frustration at the lack of results and the state Democratic Party admitting that it was experiencing delays because of "inconsistencies" in the results through "quality control" checks on the data. The party is also releasing three new sets of data as part of the results, instead of the final delegate count, which could have contributed to the long wait times.
Around 10:30 p.m. Eastern time, the state party held a conference call with representatives from each campaign and told them that roughly 35 percent of precincts had reported, but that it would provide no other details about the night's results.
A spokeswoman for the Iowa Democratic Party issued a statement late Monday denying reports that the delays were the result of a failure of a new app that was commissioned to tabulate and report results.
"We found inconsistencies in the reporting of three sets of results," said Mandy McClure, the spokeswoman. "In addition to the tech systems being used to tabulate results, we are also using photos of results and a paper trail to validate that all results match and ensure that we have confidence and accuracy in the numbers we report. This is simply a reporting issue, the app did not go down and this is not a hack or an intrusion. The underlying data and paper trail is sound and will simply take time to further report the results."
But multiple county chairs said that they were struggling to use the new app and were experiencing hold delays of up to an hour when calling into a phone hotline the party has used for decades.
The Floyd County chair said that he had three precincts completely unable to report results, trying both the app and the hotline. The caucus secretary for a precinct in Story County said he had been on hold for over an hour to report the results. The Humboldt County chair said one of its precincts had faced wait times of up to 30 minutes.
Other county chairs, however, said they had no problems with the app or phone lines.
While there were delays in reporting, the issues appear only to have delayed results, not called them into question.
Late Monday night, Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s campaign sent a letter to the Iowa Democratic Party citing "considerable flaws" in the reporting system for the caucuses and seeking information from the party before results were made public.
Dana Remus, the campaign's general counsel, wrote that the app to relay results from the caucuses had "failed" and that the backup telephone reporting system did not work either. "These acute failures are occurring statewide," Ms. Remus wrote.
On Twitter, Kate Bedingfield, a deputy campaign manager for Mr. Biden, said the flaws "should raise serious concerns for voters."
Christopher C. Krebs, the director of the Homeland Security Department's cybersecurity agency, said late Monday evening that the mobile app had not been vetted or evaluated by the agency.
Cybersecurity experts also said that the app had not been properly tested at scale, and that it was hastily put together over the past two months. Iowa Democratic Party officials only decided to use the mobile app to report results after a previous party reporting proposal -- which entailed having caucus participants call in their votes over the phone -- was scrapped, on the advice of Democratic National Committee officials.
J. Alex Halderman, a professor of computer science at the University of Michigan, and David Jefferson, a computer scientist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, said Monday night that they had warned state officials that the mobile reporting app was vulnerable to what is known as a "denial of service attack," in which hackers flood the central servers used to power the app with traffic, stalling them or knocking them offline.
"This app has never been used in any real election or tested at a statewide scale and it's only been contemplated for use for two months now," said Mr. Jefferson, who also serves on the board of Verified Voting, a nonpartisan election integrity organization.
"This is an embarrassment but it shouldn't shake people's confidence in the results," Mr. Halderman said. "If this had been an election conducted by phone, or online, that would have been a major disaster. We might never know the results and would have had to re-run the entire contest."
"This is an urgent reminder," Mr. Halderman said, "of why online voting is not ready for prime time."
Mr. Jefferson warned that Nevada is also currently slated to use a similar mobile app to report its caucus results in a few weeks.
In 2016, Iowa state officials used a Microsoft app to report results. A Microsoft spokesman said the company's involvement in 2016 was a one-off and that it had no involvement in the caucus this year.
The secrecy around the app used this year came from the Iowa Democratic Party, which asked that even its name be withheld from the public. According to a person familiar with the app, its creators had repeatedly questioned the need to keep it secret, especially from the Iowa precincts where it would be used.
That person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he had agreed not to discuss details of the app, said that there were concerns that the app would malfunction in areas with poor connectivity, or because of high bandwidth use, such as when many people tried to use it at the same time.
Matt Blaze, a professor of computer science and law at Georgetown, said that introducing apps in the midst of an election posed many problems. Any type of app or program that relied on using a cellphone network to deliver results was vulnerable to problems both on the app and on the phones being used to run it, he said.
"The consensus of all experts who have been thinking about this is unequivocal. Internet and mobile voting should not be used at this time in civil elections," Mr. Blaze said. Any technology, he added, should be tested and retested by the broader cybersecurity community before being publicly introduced, to test for anything ranging from a small bug to a major vulnerability. "I think the most important rule of thumb in introducing technology into voting is be extremely conservative."
Earlier on Monday, reports that Iowa precinct chairs were struggling to use the app fueled conspiracy theories on social media and raised questions about how smoothly the high-stakes nominating contest would unfold.
Hours before the beginning of the contest, the headquarters of the Iowa Democratic Party received multiple calls from precinct chairs around the state reporting problems with the app.
The state party said at the time that nearly all of the calls were related to user-error problems, such as precincts in areas with bad cellphone service having problems downloading or logging into the app, or others simply asking about the app's functionality. The party said then that it would not ultimately affect the reporting of results.
But Jerry Depew, the Democratic county chair from Pocahontas County, said that the report line and the help line were the same phone number.
"I had not expected it to be busy at 8 p.m.," he said, when he tried to call in results from his precinct. "But if caucus chairs were calling for help at the same time that easy caucuses were trying to report results, the phones could have been overloaded."
Earlier on Monday, state party officials had emphasized that there would be no delays with results because of reported problems with the app.
"The I.D.P. is working with any precinct chairs who want to use the optional tabulation application to make sure they are comfortable with it," Ms. McClure, the Iowa Democratic Party spokeswoman, said in a statement. "We've always been aware that many precinct chairs prefer to call in results via a secure hotline, and have systems in place so they can do so."

Texto completo: The report found that more than 1.5 million public school students experienced homelessness in the 2017-18 school year, the highest in more than a dozen years.
Some children lost a stable home when a parent succumbed to opioid addiction. Others were forced to stay in hotels after hurricanes or fires destroyed their homes. Still others fled abuse or neglect.
More than 1.5 million public school students nationwide said they were homeless at some point during the 2017-18 school year, the most recent data available, according to a report from the National Center for Homeless Education released last week.
It was the highest number recorded in more than a dozen years, and experts said it reflected a growing problem that could negatively affect children's academic performance and health.
"The ripple effect here is real," said Dr. Megan Sandel, a director of the Grow Clinic at the Boston Medical Center, who said housing instability was associated with developmental delays in children and children in fair or poor health.
The center, which is based at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro and is funded by the United States Department of Education, issued the report on Jan. 29. Its findings came as a housing affordability crisis sweeps the nation and homelessness continues to rise.
The report compared the 2017-18 school year with the 2015-16 school year and found a 15 percent increase in the number of students nationwide who experienced homelessness.
The 2017-18 number was more than double the nearly 680,000 homeless students reported in 2004-05, the first school year examined by the center, its director, George Hancock, said.
The report also showed a 137 percent increase, to more than 102,000, in the number of students who while homeless reported staying in "unsheltered" places, such as abandoned buildings and cars.
The center compiles figures submitted annually by states to the federal government that include students who said they were homeless for even brief periods during the school year. Homelessness could mean sharing homes with other families during times of economic hardship or spending a night in a homeless shelter.
The numbers influence the distribution of federal and state funds for homeless programs. They capture only what was reported by state or local officials. Numbers from Vermont, for example, were not included for the 2017-18 school year because the state did not provide them in time.
Texas reported the largest increase over the three school years, with the number of homeless students doubling, to more than 231,000 in 2017-18. Fourteen states reported a decrease.
The report did not offer reasons for the changes but experts pointed to diverse factors that may have helped drive the totals in a troubling upward direction.
"It is complex, depending on where you are in the country," said Barbara Duffield, the executive director of SchoolHouse Connection, a nonprofit based in Washington that supports youths who are homeless.
Severe natural disasters could drive the increases, particularly in Texas and Florida, which had a 32 percent rise, Ms. Duffield said. Both states were hit hard by storms that ravaged thousands of homes.
She said a lack of affordable housing, the opioid and methamphetamine addiction crises, and fluctuations in local economic conditions -- a factory shutting down, leaving parents unemployed and unable to pay rent, for example -- all influence the rise in homeless students.
In many cases, districts have been getting better at identifying which students are homeless.
"We definitely see that when school districts pay more attention, when they invest in training, when they get out into the community, then the numbers also go up," Ms. Duffield said.
In Santa Rosa County, Fla., which is on the Gulf Coast, the school district identified more than 1,000 students of a total population of nearly 28,000 as having experienced homelessness in the 2017-18 school year.
The majority live with other families, also known as "doubled up," said Karen Barber, the district's director of federal programs. She said most homeless students also have a single parent.
The numbers have declined in recent years as the local economy has improved and the district has expanded programs to help homeless students, she said. But rising housing costs have kept the figures higher than they should be, she said.
"We're not moving the needle as much as we could because of the lack of affordable housing," she said. "That really is the biggest issue."
She said district staff look for "red flags" that might indicate a student is homeless, such as recurring tardiness or an unpaid meal balance.
Ms. Duffield said many students are often "living in fear and shame." Some families do not report homelessness because they think it would constitute child abuse or neglect.
"People don't let their school officials know when they've been homeless," said Marybeth Shinn, a professor at Vanderbilt University who researches homelessness.
The annual numbers in the center's report most likely underestimate the problem. For example, they do not include private school students. An audit by California in November found that public school districts significantly undercounted the number of homeless students.
Professor Shinn said the data also left out children who were not yet in kindergarten and who make up a significant portion of the overall number of homeless children.
The numbers, she said, do not capture the impact homelessness may have on children throughout their lifetimes.
"The question is: What are the long-term effects of homelessness on children, as opposed to the very immediate effects?" she said.

Texto completo: Every weekday, we recommend one piece of exceptional writing from across the newsroom. You never know what you'll find. And that's the point.
Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
The Times publishes an astonishing amount of stuff every week, and that's because we know our readers come to us with an astonishing array of interests. All of you want to stay informed about the biggest news of the day, but some of you also want to go deep on specific passions of yours, whether theater or physics, investing or football, pop music or gadgets. We give you recipes to cook, puzzles to solve, advice on what to buy. We don't expect anyone to read every word we publish in print and online -- besides, it's almost impossible -- but our goal is that all our readers can find enough of what they love to keep coming back, day after day.
For me, as a longtime reader -- and now, for the past five years, as an editor here -- I've always come for the great storytelling. But that's not something you find in just one section of The Times. It's true that the part I work on, The New York Times Magazine, devotes itself to publishing a few in-depth pieces of narrative writing every week. But if you read widely throughout The Times, you know that every single department, from the newshounds at National and Metro to the epicures of Dining to the rarefied intellects of Books and beyond, will regularly find a fascinating tale to tell you: some character study, or scenic dispatch, or heartfelt personal essay that you can't help reading all the way to the end.
That's why I'm thrilled to be introducing The Great Read, a new, highly curated digital home for great writing from all around The Times. If you read us online, you may have noticed it already, near the top of the home page every weekday: one feature story that you can read at lunchtime, or on the train after work, or at bedtime, drawn from a wide variety of desks and covering a wide variety of subjects.
What makes a "great read," in my eyes? It's certainly not length -- one of the first Great Reads we picked was just shy of 900 words, a lovely Science dispatch from an observatory in Armenia. Instead, it's about sustained storytelling, about showing readers a person or a place not merely as a jumping-off point for breaking news or explanation but as a destination in itself.
The inaugural Great Read in our project, by Ellen Barry, was a splendid case in point: a report from Old Town, Maine., pop. 7,500, describing what happened when a mysterious Chinese company came to town and bought up the struggling paper mill. Sure, Ms. Barry's story takes place against the backdrop of a host of larger issues: the Trump administration's trade war with China, the political tides of rural America, the convulsions of a postindustrial economy, all of which she nods at in the telling of her tale.
But ultimately, she and her editors had the confidence to let it be a tale, to let it follow the odd twists and turns that only real life can supply: the seven Buddhist monks who come to sanctify the mill, the feng shui consultant ("Feng Shui Eddie") called in to worry about the spirits that might spring forth from the local cemetery. Many news stories use narrative anecdotes on the way to making bigger points, but with Great Reads, it's the opposite: The narrative is the point, and the best lessons that emerge tend to be the ones that are shown rather than told, the unpredictable truths of human experience.
Whatever you look for in The Times each day, I hope you will pause over the coming weeks and months to take a look at The Great Read. Sometimes the story will be fun, like the recent profile of a Chicago chef who wants to chuck it all to start an inn in the wilds of Michigan. Sometimes it will be twisty and complex, like the recent Business story about an enormous tax fraud scheme in Europe. Or heartbreaking and human, like the magazine's recent cover story about a daughter's quest to find her parents after they disappeared into a Uighur re-education camp in China. But I hope that all the stories will take you somewhere you were not expecting to go -- and that you will find the journey to be a worthy one.

Texto completo: Once hailed as an entrepreneurial success story, the "telecom cowboy," he presided over one of the biggest scandals in American corporate history.
Bernard J. Ebbers, who built a modest Mississippi phone company into a telecommunications giant, WorldCom, but later went to jail after its collapse in one of the nation's largest corporate scandals, died on Sunday at his home in Brookhaven, Miss. He was 78.
His health had sharply deteriorated in recent months, his family said in a statement provided by his lawyer, Graham P. Carner, who confirmed the death. One of his daughters, Joy Ebbers Bourne, said in a court filing in October that Mr. Ebbers was "now experiencing full-blown dementia."
Mr. Ebbers, who in 2005 was sentenced to 25 years in prison, was freed from a federal prison in Texas in December, having been granted compassionate release by a federal judge to spend his final months at home.
In what was once considered a great entrepreneurial success story, Mr. Ebbers turned his small company in Mississippi, Long Distance Discount Service, into a telecommunications juggernaut, earning him the sobriquet "the telecom cowboy."
The company, renamed WorldCom, grew through an astonishing string of more than 40 mergers and acquisitions, including the $ 37 billion takeover in 1998 of MCI Communications, which was twice the size of WorldCom. At its peak in 1999, WorldCom employed 80,000 people and had a market capitalization of about $ 180 billion.
The company's sudden growth presented it with an array of new challenges, including placating federal regulators, courting multinational corporate customers and serving millions of residential customers.
But Mr. Ebbers minimized the immensity of his task.
"You know, it's not as complicated as people make it out to be," he told The New York Times in 1998 as he sat in the wood-paneled dining room of his 130-foot yacht, Countach, while it was berthed at Hilton Head, S.C.
He said he would succeed by relying on experts. "I'm not an engineer by training; I'm not an accountant by training," he said. "I'm the coach. I'm not the point guard who shoots the ball."
But the company's apparent growth turned out to be largely illusory, facilitated by accounting trickery. At his 2005 trial, held in Manhattan, former employees testified that Mr. Ebbers had urged them to inflate WorldCom's financial results to make the company appear more profitable than it was.
The jury convicted him of securities fraud, conspiracy and filing false reports, despite his argument that he had been misled by subordinates and in the dark about any wrongdoing.
His case was one of a slew notable corporate scandals in the first half of the last decade that caught up high-ranking executives, including Jeffrey Skilling at Enron, John Rigas at Adelphia Communications and Dennis Kozlowski at Tyco International.
But Mr. Ebbers's 25-year sentence was among the harshest ever imposed on a corporate executive.
"The problem is that Bernard Ebbers was transformed into a symbol of corporate corruption," Reid Weingarten, one of his lawyers, said after he was sentenced.
WorldCom had $ 107 billion in assets when it applied for bankruptcy protection in July 2002 -- the largest bankruptcy filing in United States corporate history at the time -- and its rapid fall reverberated throughout the industry. Thousands of WorldCom employees lost their jobs, insurance and pensions as well as their 401(k) retirement savings when the price of the company's stock plummeted.
The rival AT&T had laid off tens of thousands of its people in the late 1990s as it tried to chase WorldCom's phantom profits.
In 2005, Mr. Ebbers, who was once worth $ 1 billion on paper, surrendered nearly all of his remaining $ 40 million fortune to investors who had lost billions in the bankruptcy
The WorldCom scandal was the largest accounting scandal in American history until Bernie Madoff's Ponzi scheme, involving billions of dollars and thousands of victims, was revealed in 2008.
Bernard John Ebbers was born on Aug. 27, 1941, in Edmonton, Alberta, to John T. and Kathleen Mary (Ellen) Ebbers. His father was a traveling salesman and a mechanic, and his mother was a homemaker.
The family moved to California in the 1940s. Later, Bernie, as he was called, attended boarding school on a Navajo reservation. He ended up receiving a basketball scholarship -- he was 6-foot-4 tall -- to Mississippi College, a private Baptist institution in Clinton, Miss. He graduated in 1967 with a degree in physical education.
Mr. Ebbers married Linda Pigott in 1968, and they divorced in 1997. He and his second wife, Kristie Ebbers, who were married in 1999, divorced in 2008.
He is survived by four daughters, Ave Easley, Treasure Ebbers Beeson, Joy Ebbers Bourne and Faith Ebbers Gates; three brothers, John, James and Stephen; a sister, Marion Olthuis; 12 grandchildren; and one great-grandson.
Fresh out of college, Mr. Ebbers worked as a high school basketball coach and operated motels.
In 1983, the breakup of AT&T enabled thousands of competitors to start reselling long-distance telephone service to individual and business customers. This prompted Mr. Ebbers and a handful of investors to back Long Distance Discount Services, which eventually established its headquarters in Jackson, Miss.
"The only experience Bernie had before operating a long-distance company was he used the phone," Carl J. Aycock, an early investor and WorldCom board member, said in 1997.
Mr. Ebbers became chief executive in 1985 and changed the company name to WorldCom in 1995. The company grew by buying up other companies and taking on debt. Mr. Ebbers began to borrow money from WorldCom in the late 1990s, using loans to buy more company stock.
Over the years the company increasingly took on Mr. Ebbers's debt, and by 2002 he owed WorldCom more than $ 400 million. That led to an inquiry by the Securities and Exchange Commission and to Mr. Ebbers's dismissal.
At his trial in 2005, the government argued that Mr. Ebbers had told "lie after lie after lie" to cover up the company's mounting losses and to stave off his own financial downfall.
His lawyers argued that he had been unaware of what his subordinates were doing and that no chief financial officer at the company had ever told him that there was anything wrong.
Mr. Ebbers took the stand in his own defense, and that turned out to be a blunder. Jurors said later that he had been evasive and defensive.
The jury's reaction was described by the father of a juror on estrong.com, a financial newsletter's website. He said the jury had "concluded that with his personal fortune evaporating and the company he built sinking, it was inconceivable that Ebbers was not paying attention" to the details of his company's finances.
Mr. Ebbers had been scheduled to be released from prison on July 4, 2028, but after more than 13 years of incarceration he was granted compassionate release on Dec. 21.
In a statement on Monday, Ms. Bourne, one of his daughters, said the family understood that many of the victims of her father's scheme had opposed his early release. But, she said, she was grateful for Judge Valerie Caproni's judgment that keeping him in prison would not bring back anyone's investments.
She added that the Ebbers family would join a movement of people who are pressing for the compassionate release of ailing prisoners.

Texto completo: BERLIN - Rental prices on more than 1.5 million Berlin apartments will be frozen or lowered for five years as a result of new legislation aimed at halting a recent spike in rents that is driving out older and lower-income residents.
The measure, which lawmakers approved last week and which is to take effect this month, is an attempt by Berlin's leftist government to slow the gentrification of a city that built a reputation on a creative scene but is being squeezed by real estate investors and infrastructure projects.
"We have created an instrument that will stop the partially absurd price developments for the next five years," Katrin Lompscher, Berlin's senator for city development and living, said at a news conference. "It is up to politicians to create the basic conditions for lower- and middle-class earners to be able to afford to live in Berlin."
Renting is more common in Germany than homeownership, with more than half of the country's residents renting their homes.
In Berlin, a city of 3 million people, only 18% of residents own their homes.
The new law caps most rents in the city at 2019 levels and limits the amount that can be charged based on the apartment's condition and amenities.
Critics say the move will hamper desperately needed growth in the property market and frighten off those willing to build affordable housing in a city, once known for its "poor but sexy" party scene of the 1990s, that has become a rapidly changing capital.
Real estate developers and members of Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservative party have threatened to challenge the law. They argue that it violates the country's constitution, which stipulates that rents are set by the federal government.
"The rent cap is equivalent to an expropriation and is a catastrophe for Berlin's real estate market," said Jürgen Michael Schick, president of Germany's Real Estate Association.
The group has warned about the negative effects the measure could have since the city government proposed it last year.
"Limiting and reducing the income from rents will create uncertainty for investors and will ward off real estate developers from investing," Schick said.
Lompscher said the aim was not to halt growth in the city's housing stock but to ease the strain on renters while private developers and city officials facilitate the construction of more housing.
The city plans to construct more than 60,000 apartments in the coming years, many of them lower-priced properties, she said.
After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, the reunited city found itself with a glut of apartments, many of which were publicly owned.
In an effort to bring in desperately needed cash to pay for the reunification of East and West Berlin, many properties were privatized.
Foreign property investors quickly understood the potential for growth in Berlin - where rents are still notably cheaper than in London, Paris or Rome - and began buying and renovating apartments. They also started charging higher rent.
At the same time, the city's population continued to grow, adding 250,000 new residents from 2012 to 2017, according to official figures.
That combination of factors led to a spike in rental prices, especially in the most desirable areas of the city. In 2017, Berlin ranked internationally as the only major city where property values had increased more than 20% from a year earlier, with rents keeping pace.
"Three million tenants will benefit in the city," said Iris Spranger, housing affairs spokeswoman for the city's Social Democrats, one of the governing parties that approved the law.
"After a long phase of galloping prices, rents will now be stopped," she said, "and that is sorely needed."

Texto completo: Willie Wood died Monday in his hometown of Washington, D. C. , the Green Bay Packers announced. He was 83.
Wood was a fiercely athletic safety for the Green Bay Packers whose interception in Super Bowl I remains a cherished highlight for the organization.
“The Green Bay Packers Family lost a legend today with the passing of Willie Wood,” Packers President/CEO Mark Murphy said in a statement. “Willie’s success story, rising from an undrafted rookie free agent to the Pro Football Hall of Fame, is an inspiration to generations of football fans. While his health challenges kept him from returning to Lambeau Field in recent years, his alumni weekend visits were cherished by both Willie and our fans. We extend our deepest condolences to Willie’s family and friends. ”
The dynamic Wood was regarded as one of the best defensive backs in NFL history, a player whose vicious hits and plentiful interceptions dominated an entire decade in the 1960s. He played 12 seasons from 1960-71 — all with the Packers — and finished second in franchise history with 48 career interceptions.
His streak of 166 consecutive games played ranks fourth behind quarterback Brett Favre (255), offensive lineman Forrest Gregg (167) and long snapper Rob Davis (167), a testament to the durability and attitude Wood hoped would define his game.
“Determination probably was my trademark,” Wood said. “I was talented but so were a lot of people. I’d like people to tell you I was the toughest guy they ever played against. ”

DOUGHERTY: Willie Wood took safety road to Hall of Fame
Wood, who began his career as a quarterback, followed a circuitous route to Green Bay. A year of junior college in California gave way to a three-year career at Southern California with modest numbers and little national buzz. Wood went undrafted as an undersized black quarterback and relied instead on Bill Butler, his coach at the Washington, D. C. , Boys Club, to write letters to pro teams campaigning on his behalf.
“Mr. Lombardi, if you could see this kid unshackled you would really agree with me,” Butler said in a letter to coach Vince Lombardi in December of 1959. “If you hadn't contemplated giving him a chance, just try him one time and I'll guarantee you'll be glad you did. ”
Wood switched to defense and went through training camp with the Packers in 1960. He made the team as a rookie free agent and contributed immediately as a punt returner on special teams.
One year later, however, the legend of Wood was born. He replaced injured starter Jess Whittenton at safety late in the 1961 season and entrenched himself as one of the premier defensive backs in the league.
Wood made the Pro Bowl eight times in the next 11 seasons and led the Packers in interceptions five times. He earned AP All-Pro honors six times and was a unanimous selection in 1965 and 1966.
Wood retired after the 1971 season and took a job as an assistant coach for the San Diego Chargers. He went on to become the first black head coach in professional football by taking over the Philadelphia Bell of the World Football League in 1975. Five years later he became the first black head coach of the Canadian Football League as well.
“The thing is, my dad never wanted to leave football,” Andre Wood, another son of Willie’s, told The New York Times in an article published in 2016. “He needed a stable way to make a living. But I know he would have stayed in the NFL coaching track had he been asked to. But he wasn’t. ”
Perhaps his finest moment came in Super Bowl I when the Packers played the Kansas City Chiefs. Wood undercut an ugly throw by Chiefs quarterback Len Dawson for an easy interception that, after a 50-yard return, set up a touchdown in what finished as a blowout win for the Packers.
“My dad was so proud of his Super Bowl moment, but I used to tease him about being tackled from behind on the play,” Willie Wood Jr. told the Times.
“And his response would be, ‘Yes, but I was there. ’”
Wood, however, had no recollection of that play and hardly remembered his playing career at all. As detailed by the Times, the aging Wood spent the last decade in an assisted living facility in his hometown of Washington. While he originally entered for chronic pain in his neck, hip and knee, Wood eventually developed dementia that sapped his memory and limited his cognitive functions.
He sometimes went days without speaking, according to the article.
“It’s difficult to not be able to talk to him,” Willie Wood Jr. told the Times. “He was a great father. As good an athlete as he was, he was 10 times that as a father. ”
Wood often wore a Packers hat during his time at the assisted living facility, even though he could not describe the exact connection between himself and the organization. But Wood knew he loved football, and when a reporter from the Times asked if he would play the sport again if given the chance, Wood’s answer was simple.
“Without waiting even a beat,” the article said, “Wood firmly nodded. ”
“You liked it that much?”
“He nodded again. ”
Willie Wood file: Facts and figures
Born: Dec. 23, 1936, in Washington, D. C.

Filled in for the injured Jess Whittenton in 1961 and made five interceptions in the second half of the year. Also led the league in punt return average (16. 2 yards) and returned two punts for touchdowns. Wood took off from there and had a career-high nine interceptions in 1962 to earn the first of eight Pro Bowl selections (1962, 1964-70). He earned AP All-Pro honors six times and was a unanimous selection twice, in 1965 and 1966. Best known for his vicious hitting and iconic interception in Super Bowl I that set up a touchdown in a game the Packers won, 35-10. Played 166 consecutive games over the course of his career. Finished with 48 interceptions, two defensive touchdowns and two punt return touchdowns. Tackling statistics were unavailable during Wood’s era. He wore jersey number 24.
Post playing career: Wood retired after the 1971 season and took an assistant coaching position with the San Diego Chargers. Four years later he became the first black head coach in professional football when he ran the Philadelphia Bell of the World Football League. In 1980, Wood became the first black head coach in the Canadian Football League as well. He was in charge of the Toronto Argonauts for two seasons. Wood spent the last decade in an assisted living facility in his hometown of Washington.

Texto completo: The article about present-day Chaparral reflects human nature at its most hopeful and also at its most opportunistic ("Getting a slice of America," Searchlight New Mexico, Jan. 21).
My family and I traveled to Chaparral in 1998 from our home in Santa Fe. We were not looking to buy land. I had been commissioned to design murals for a new public health facility there. The health building had cinderblock construction and no frills; it was run by a nun who had single-handedly raised the funding for the facility and helped to design, outfit and staff the clinic. She was the closest I have ever met to a living saint. She cared deeply for the residents of Chaparral.
I designed and created the murals without visiting the site and corresponded with the sister by phone and postal services. The sister wanted the murals to be uplifting and hopeful, so I designed them for the children, showing the flora and fauna surrounding the clinic. I hope the clinic still exists today. It would be one place that still provides hope and care for the families of Chaparral.

Act responsibly
To make a long story short, to cut down on strays and so many unwanted pets, it's imperative that you act responsibly and spay/neuter your pets.

What's fair
So, there was a trial where Republicans didn't allow any witnesses? Seems fair enough. And while we're at it, maybe in the next election, we don't allow any Republican voters?

No name-calling
Labeling those of us who are concerned about the plight of the Palestinians as anti-Semitic is offensive. Considering how much aid we in the United States send to Israel, they should be thanking us, not calling us names.

Missing testimony
I would have liked to have seen the testimony of Hunter Biden along with John Bolton in President Donald Trump's impeachment trial. We had gone this far. What would that testimony have revealed?

Calmly reporting facts
I am tired of the deregulated, corrupt national media's need to - in childish, sophomoric ways - create villains rather than, as Walter Cronkite did, calmly report the facts. As hero-on-the-Hudson Captain Sully Sullenberger said, media "incite rather than inform." Rather than praise the pilot of the Delta plane for getting 164 passengers safely down after an engine explosion, media, by omissions and nuance, almost implied fuel was deliberately dropped on children ("Why did a Delta Plane Dump Jet Fuel Over Los Angeles Schools?," New York Times, Jan. 15). The pilot had the misfortune of the sensational footage being of fuel falling, not lives being saved.
The same media seem incapable of focusing on critical issues, such as why are there no moderates from either party running for president, what is a lack of campaign finance reform doing to our democracy and has deregulation left us with media incapable of revering the truth or fulfilling their obligation to report it?

Double taxation
Kudos to Connie Coates for her letter ("No taxing Social Security," Letters to the Editor, Jan. 27). I agree that it is double taxation and should be eliminated. Please note that it takes more than a few to make a big change as necessary as this one. Contact the lawmakers now.

'Hustlers' makes waves at Askew Student Life Cinema

Texto completo: "Hustlers" is a film inspired by the story of Roselyn Keo, a stripper made famous by Jessica Pressler's story in the New York Times. "Hustlers" has received mixed reviews since its release in September of last year. The movie features stars like Jennifer Lopez, Keke Palmer, Lili Reinhart, Lizzo and former stripper, now rapper, Cardi B.
The film was played this past week at the Askew Student Life Center (ASLC), where Florida State students came to see what all the discussion was about. This movie was one of a kind because of the fact that this movie was based on the true accounts of Keo and her friends, drugging and robbing their clients blind.
The movie, which has been nominated for over 15 awards, was a big hit when it premiered at the ASLC. While it was not filled, there was quite a large turnout for the film. When asked for their opinion before the film, students were excited to see a film that would be beneficial for women of all ages.
"I think this movie could be beneficial to women who are interested in becoming directors," FSU student, Elizabeth Birch commented. "Women directors in Hollywood don't have the same exposure as men so to have a movie comes out that's a box office success and was directed by a woman is great. I think this movie could also be beneficial to women who work as strippers/ exotic dancers. It gives them more representation than just an occasional side character role because the entire movie focuses around them."
As well as being the beneficial aspect of this film, many students expressed how much they loved the empowerment featured in the film.
"I felt like the writers turned a real life story into a very effective plot," said Miles Feacher, a third year at Florida State, studying International Affairs. "I think it's wonderful how [Jennifer Lopez] was able to learn pole dancing for the movie and how she is 50 and has been able to maintain a great physique... The ending is really great and speaks to motherhood."
According to reviews, most people thought positively about the plot and the story-line, while others truly enjoyed the movie just for the stars or the acting. The group of women featured have not worked on something like this before, most being known for teen drama shows. One thing that a few viewers wanted was a deeper look into being a stripper.
"I really feel like strippers get a bad reputation," MyKayla Edwards, a second year studying Sociology and International Affairs, commented on what she expected from the movie. "I was hoping to get more insight into what it was really like. Cinematically, it was good, but it was not what I was expecting based on the trailer."
The movie did not really focus on what being a stripper was like, without the drugging and robbing. There were parts that showed how they were a giant family and how people would always underestimate them or disregard them because they were strippers.
Overall, the movie received positive feedback from the students. Throughout the film, there were bouts of laughter from the audience and, when it was over, a lot of people were smiling with their group as they left.
"Hustlers," a film about former New York City strippers teaming up to provide for their family by any means possible, premieres at the Askew Student Life Center.

In defense of the Iowa caucuses

Texto completo: Like clockwork every four years, critiques against Iowa’s influence in the presidential election cycle start to pile up: “No state should wield such power.” “Iowa is too old and too white.” “Iowa is not representative of the nation as a whole.” The latest entry in this body of literature is by New York Times columnist David Leonhardt, who begins with a blatantly click-baity headline, “Iowa Should Never Be First Again.” He argues that the state’s prominence is undeserved, that Iowa’s first-in-the-nation role as a winnower of a large field of candidates smacks of white privilege in an increasingly diverse America.
Here’s the thing: Iowa is increasingly diverse. Yes, the 90% white racial demographic is often cited, but that percentage is decreasing steadily as the Hispanic population in the state has dramatically increased in the past 30 years. That demographic is expected to grow by nearly 450,000 in the next three decades, doubling to nearly 13 percent of Iowa’s population. Crawford County is projected to become the first in Iowa to have a Latino majority, 57.9 percent by 2050. An hour to the north sits Storm Lake, Iowa, home of the celebrated Storm Lake Times, which was awarded a Pulitzer in 2017 for editorial writing. In his memoir about Storm Lake, newspaper editor Art Cullen focused on his hometown’s diversity, writing that “immigrants comprise 90% of the elementary school enrollment.”
One of the most visible critics of the Iowa caucuses in this cycle has been former candidate Julián Castro, who dropped out on Jan. 2 and placed at least part of the blame for his failing campaign on the white voters of Iowa. But Castro got only a lukewarm reception to his candidacy as a whole, as his national poll numbers never broke 3 percent. Even voters of color were hesitant to throw their full support to him because of overarching concerns related to electability.
2004: a different, simpler time
Furthermore, Leonhardt cites a 16-year old study, which argues that early states hold an outsized influence on the eventual outcome of presidential elections. But the flaw in that citation is that it focused almost entirely on the 2004 Democratic primary process. Ah, 2004! A simpler, pre-recession time in our country when the fragmentation of the media had not yet accelerated. Facebook had just been founded and social media as we know it today did not exist. It remains to be seen just how influential Iowa will ultimately prove to be in 2020, but there are signs that social media may already be upending the long-held notion (in the words of George H.W. Bush) of “Big Mo” or momentum that top finishers in the state’s caucus have come to expect.
What the caucuses have unequivocally done for Iowa and the Midwest as a whole is provided more media coverage to a region of the country that remains overlooked and underestimated by coastal elites. In recent years, that coverage (especially in the lead up to the caucuses) has fallen into two main categories. Op-eds like Leonhardt’s are mean-spirited and reveal longstanding elitist attitudes and an urban, East Coast bias against the Midwest. Such bloviating contributes significantly to the idea that the coasts are out of touch with the so-called “flyover” folks at a time when our political and cultural divisions are already exacerbated by pronounced online tribalism.
But these attitudes colored by privilege are nothing new. Leonhardt and other East Coast pundits bring to mind an old New Yorker cartoon, Saul Steinberg’s View of the World from 9th Avenue that illustrates New York City in great detail, then looking West, a vast no man’s land just beyond the Hudson River, with cities like Chicago, Las Vegas, and Los Angeles drawn as minor blips on the map. Iowa is not even there. It’s notable, however, that Steinberg’s cartoon appeared in 1976, the year that the Iowa caucuses helped propel Jimmy Carter to the Democratic nomination and eventually to the presidency. Now, the East Coast media establishment had to start paying attention to the voters in Iowa.
Keen insights, respectful stance toward Iowans
The second category of media coverage on Iowa is what I term “deep dive” journalism: thoughtful, important stories that provide nuance and complexity to the Midwest experience and offer an important window into the lives of regular people outside the beltway of D.C. and borders of Manhattan or Los Angeles. The recent piece on Howard County, Iowa, from the Wall Street Journal is an exceptional example of such journalism, but reporters like Trip Gabriel (who while working for the New York Times “embedded” himself inside the state for a year during the 2016 election) also demonstrated keen analytical insights and a respectful stance toward the Iowans he covered. We’ll never know, of course, if national media outlets would pay much attention to Iowa without the caucuses, but I suspect it’s doubtful that they would.
Moreover, there is something to the argument that Iowans take their responsibility as voters seriously. The state is distinguished by the highest rate of literacy in the country, a notable statistic that is indicative of a unique brand of civic engagement that may not necessarily be as replicable in states with much larger voting populations — notably Texas, California, or New York. Iowa caucus supporters emphasize the value of “retail politics” for candidates, and it has proven to be a fascinating laboratory for campaign innovation. As former DNC chairwoman Donna Brazile recently stated of Iowa’s voters, “While it doesn’t look like America, when they take into consideration the qualities and values we’re looking for in a candidate, I believe that they represent what is truly best about our country.” She further added, “They’re smart and they take this seriously.”
The relevance of the Iowa caucuses comes down to this simple truism: There’s value in coming together face-to-face, as Iowans will once again do on Monday night. They will meet in high school cafeterias and gyms, town halls, and civic centers. At a time when many a journalist or cultural critic laments the loss of community in America or decries the outrage machine perpetuated by uncivil dialogues on social media, let Iowa continue to serve as a model of civil, civic engagement in its small towns and in its cities under 250,000.

Texto completo: A joint legislative committee has taken the first small steps toward considering what a handful of cities and states around the country have already done — regulating or banning the use of facial recognition software by business and government.
It was such a small step considered by a subcommittee of the relatively obscure Legislative Coordinating Commission that the chair corrected a witness who called a proposal a “draft of legislation.”
“You made reference to this draft of legislation,” Sen. Warren Limmer said. “I don’t see it as legislation. I see it as a draft. Once it gets authored I would say it’s potential legislation.”
So what was before the subcommittee Thursday? “It is designed for the purpose of our commission to have a discussion, a starting point,” the Maple Grove Republican said. “It is to provoke reaction and discussion by the public as well as our members.” And since the subcommittee has sunsetted, any bill that might emerge would have to start in a standing committee of the Legislature, such as Limmer’s Senate Judiciary and Public Safety Committee or Rep. John Lesch’s House Judiciary and Civil Law subcommittee.
The Thursday draft was brief: Police agencies in Minnesota would have to have written policies on the use of the technology; they couldn’t enter into agreements with private entities to gain facial recognition data; unless it is part of a criminal investigation, people whose facial recognition data is collected have a right to access that data; data collected by agencies is subject to the Data Practices Act; police agencies must prepare reports that show how often such data is used in a criminal investigation, how often it is used for reasons other than a criminal investigation and the number of times a police agency shared data with other police agencies or government entities.
The draft doesn’t do a lot of other things common to other states and cities. Primarily, it doesn’t ban the use of facial recognition technology nor even place a moratorium on its use. Priyanka Premo, a Senate staff attorney assigned to the subcommittee, said the draft also doesn’t discuss whether to restrict the use of the technology by both public and private entities or try to distinguish between allowed uses and disallowed uses.
She said other topics of discussion not included in the draft could be whether a city council or county commission should have to give public approval for use of the technology. And there are also concerns that the technology has higher false identification results for African-Americans and Asian-Americans and potential legislation could try to respond to those. Finally, she said the Legislature could consider prohibiting the incorporation of non-law enforcement databases such as drivers license photos.
The subcommittee met the same week that 40 organizations signed a letter to a federal commission that reviews privacy concerns post 9/11. The letter, signed by civil rights and privacy groups, called for a nationwide ban on use of the technology. It came in the aftermath of a New York Times article about a company called Clearview AI that claims to have scraped 3 billion photos from social media. Its application lets users upload a photo and match it to any of those photos, along with links to where those photos appeared. The founder claims to have provided the app to 600 police agencies, including the FBI and Homeland Security.
As with most privacy and civil liberties issues, support came from both liberals and conservatives, from the ACLU to a member of the House New Republican Caucus.
Rich Neumeister, a privacy and government transparency advocate, suggested that the Legislature at least place a moratorium on the technology until the state had time to review the concerns. He cited three local cases where questions about the technology have come up:
* The Metropolitan Council just contracted with a vendor to provide improved cameras for light rail trains that are capable of real-time monitoring of riders using data bases of photos of potential troublemakers, as well as capture audio of passengers;
* St. Paul just purchased a system that helps it sort through body and surveillance camera footage that could be equipped with facial recognition capabilities; and
* The Minneapolis Police Department has said it doesn’t use the technology but freelance journalist Tony Webster has found in probable cause statements where police officers say it was used.
“The new technologies … enable retroactive and real-time mass surveillance. It changes the balance of power between its people and the government,” Neumeister said. “When it comes to technology like this that compromises civil liberties and privacies, the Legislature — you — need to take the bull by the horns and come out with a comprehensive kind of legislation.”
Julia Decker, policy director of the ACLU-Minnesota, said the technology could “upend the right to be anonymous in public.” She compared it to “wearing a blown-up copy of your driver’s license on your chest with a GPS tracking device attached.”
Said Rep. Eric Lucero, R-Dayton: “In my opinion, increased use of surveillance capabilities by government is a significant threat to both the spirit and letter of the 4th Amendment.” He said it could dissuade citizens from exercising speech and assembly rights.
Limmer said he was sensitive to privacy concerns but said the technology could have benefits to public safety.
“Why would you want a camera on an isolated light rail passenger car?” Limmer asked. “The answer is somewhat obvious. Because there’s a crime taking place in an isolated location like that and usually there are no witnesses, the victim is alone. The public good would be to gather information for prosecution and put the signal out that you will get caught.” That would in turn give passengers more confidence to use the light rail system, Limmer said.
Cass Weiland, a self-described technologist and a member of the Minnesota chapter of Restore the Fourth said he agreed that technology can have a positive impact on society.
“We love technology. We know that it can play a really important role in public safety and prosecuting crimes,” Weiland said. “What we want to emphasize is that when you think about the systems and the technologies that we’re building, the structure of how it is integrated into society, the decisions are largely being made by companies and corporations that don’t have the public interest in mind.
“It’s up to government, it’s up to you guys, to weigh the public interest,” Weiland said.
Metro Transit spokesman Howie Padilla said that the agency has no plans to employ facial recognition on trains and that while the new camera system has such capabilities, the agency did not purchase that application from the vendor.
At the end of the hearing, Rep. Peggy Scott, a backer of the draft proposal, summarized the unease she said she has with the increased use of surveillance.
“Now that we all want to buy a piece of land in the forests of Colorado to evade all this stuff, it’s overwhelming,” the Andover Republican said. “You can see the gravity of what we have to deal with here.”

Christina Ryan Claypool: The ‘Love Story’ lie

Texto completo: It’s hard to believe it’s been 50 years since the classic movie, “Love Story,” first hit the silver screen in 1970. If you’re a boomer or beyond, you are probably familiar with the film’s storyline.
“Oliver Barrett IV (Ryan O’Neal), the heir of an American upper-class East Coast family, is attending Harvard College, where he plays hockey. He meets Jennifer ‘Jenny’ Cavilleri, (Ali McGraw), a quick-witted, working-class Radcliffe College student of classical music. They quickly fall in love despite their differences,” according to Wikepedia.org.
Huge spoiler alert, viewers know from the beginning that the ending will be heartbreaking. This is revealed in the film’s opening, when the audience is presented with the poignant line: “What can you say about a girl who was 25 and died?”
The tragic romantic drama was written by author Erich Segal and based on his best-selling novel, “Love Story.” The American Film Institute lists the movie as No. 9 on its list of most romantic movies and was the highest-grossing film of 1970 taking in $106.4 million at the box office.
But did this seemingly harmless heartbreaker of a movie negatively affect the romantic relationships of the countless then young, impressionable theater-goers who watched it? Sadly, for some individuals, I personally believe that it did.
You see, hosts of impressionable youth might have embraced Jenny Cavilleri’s (McGraw’s) famous line, “Love means never having to say you’re sorry” to Oliver (O’Neal) when he apologizes for an angry outburst. Later, Oliver repeats the famous line to his millionaire father (Ray Milland) after Jenny dies. I’m embarrassed to say, I was among those misguided romantic girls who once found this legendary line credible.
With Valentine’s Day rapidly approaching, some theaters nationwide will host a special viewing of the film during February in celebration of its 50th anniversary. When I saw the advertisements, I wondered if a whole new generation of movie-goers might fall for this faulty philosophy.
“Am I the only one who thinks that ‘Love means never having to say you’re sorry’ is just plain wrong?” one individual asks Quora.com.
Apparently not.
“Erich Segal’s classic is no friend to love,” writes DailyMail.com columnist Amanda Craig in an archived post. “It is, quite possibly, one of the worst philosophical guides by which to conduct your life ever to have been offered… Whatever love means, saying sorry is a huge part of it.”
Unfortunately, it’s not easy to learn the art of apology. Admittedly, after being married for almost two decades, it’s still a challenge to acknowledge when I’m in the wrong. Yet I’m grateful I quickly grew to disbelieve the quotation’s dangerous message that when true love exists between two people in a relationship, it can be unconditional, no explanations necessary for bad behavior and no apologies expected for negative actions or unkind words.
If human beings were perfect, never having to say you’re sorry could work. But we are flawed, and sadly our less-than-perfect natures can result in the unwanted outcome of hurting the ones we love the most.
Dr. Gary Chapman and Dr. Jennifer Thomas believe so strongly that learning to apologize in a meaningful way is necessary to the health of a relationship, they co-wrote the book, “The Five Languages of Apology” in 2006. The book’s theme supports the theory that a sincere request for forgiveness can be an influential tool in mending a relational rift. Chapman is well-known for the New York Times bestseller, “The Five Love Languages.”
In “Love Story,” no apologies are necessary for anything ever, if you love the one you have wounded. The iconic film both won and was nominated for all kinds of 1971 industry awards, winning one Oscar for Best Music, the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture (Drama) along with another eight wins and 16 nominations in various awards and categories. Ryan O’Neal was nominated for an Oscar for Best Actor in a Leading Role. He was a young, handsome heartthrob who undoubtedly sold us a bill of goods with his infamous line.
Ironically in the last scene of his 1972 film “What’s Up, Doc,” co-starring Barbara Streisand. Streisand’s character (Judy) tells love interest Howard, played by Ryan O’Neal, “Let me tell you something, love means never having to say you’re sorry.”
“That’s the dumbest thing I ever heard,” replies Howard (O’Neal).
Truthfully, I couldn’t agree more.

Cost of closing mental hospitals is seen on streets

Texto completo: Attending a meeting near Union Station in Washington, D.C., requires me to park a few blocks away and then walk under a bridge to an office building. People in business attire, like me, step carefully around the homeless men and women who have pitched tents under the bridge. They look filthy and miserable, especially in winter.
The persistence of large numbers of homeless Americans is one of the signal policy failures of the past two generations.
A 2015 survey found that more than half a million people are homeless on any given night. According to Mentalillnesspolicy.org, about 45% of them are suffering from mental illness. When they are not on the street, many severely mentally ill people wind up in even worse surroundings.
Jane Brody, of The New York Times, reports that "the country's three largest facilities housing the mentally ill are jails: the Twin Towers in Los Angeles, the Cook County Jail in Chicago and Rikers Island in New York City." More mentally people are in jails and prisons than in hospitals.
Governments at every level spend billions on the homeless, yet the numbers sleeping on the streets remain high. In Republican and Democratic administrations, in liberal and conservative regions, thousands of disabled people, some veterans who have served their country, sleep under bridges and in abandoned buildings, and eat out of trash bins.
This is the long tail of the de-institutionalization policy adopted in the 1960s, when America closed down most of its mental hospitals, dumping the mentally ill onto the streets and calling it compassion.
Films like “One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest” cemented the public perception that treatment (especially electroshock therapy) was thinly veiled torture. Since 1955, there has been a 95% reduction in the number of psychiatric beds available.
To be sure, there were abuses in asylums, but our experience over the past 50 years has shown that we cannot do without them entirely without paying a price. It costs more to house a mentally ill person in prison than it would in a mental hospital, and prisons are ill-equipped to meet the needs of people whose minds are their worst enemies.
While we certainly need more beds for psychiatric patients, mental hospitals are not the only option. Programs like Assisted Outpatient Treatment permit judges to supervise patients' compliance with drug and therapy regimens and have been shown to reduce harmful behaviors, arrest rates, homelessness and victimization among the severely mentally ill.
Governments have also failed to prioritize treating the severely mentally ill. Many research and treatment dollars go to the "worried well" rather than to those with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depression.
In the 1960s, we convinced ourselves that closing down mental hospitals was the humane solution to a problem. Today, we are arguably tolerating an even less humane model. The mentally ill, so vulnerable and in need of care, are crowding emergency rooms, languishing in prisons and sleeping under bridges.
It's a cliche to say that this should not be the case in the wealthiest country in the world, but it's true.

Trump administration flunks microbe economics

Texto completo: How frightened should you be about the coronavirus? I’m no epidemiologist, but what I’ve seen looks pretty scary.
It doesn’t help that the Trump administration, as part of its general war against science and expertise, has seriously reduced America’s capacity to respond to a pandemic.
It also looks quite possible that the virus will inflict a lot of economic damage — even if it doesn’t kill you, it might kill your job.
And top officials in the Trump administration are talking nonsense about the economic threat.
About that threat: Many people are drawing parallels with the 2002-03 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, which also originated in China. SARS also led to quarantines, which appear to have had a modest negative impact on the world economy.
The global economic implications of a pandemic in China today are likely to be much more severe, for the simple reason that China is a vastly bigger player.
In 2002, China accounted for only around 8% of global manufacturing value added. Today, China is the workshop of the world, accounting for more than a quarter of global manufacturing.
Now, you might think this implies an upside to China’s troubles, that disrupting China’s vast manufacturing sector would offer opportunities in other countries, including the U.S.
That is, you might think this if you knew nothing about 21st-century economics.
Sure enough, Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary, appeared on “Fox Business” on Thursday to declare that he “didn’t want to talk about a victory lap,” but that the coronavirus “will help to accelerate the return of jobs to North America.”
By saying this, he demonstrated a couple of things: (1) why Gail Collins’ readers voted him Donald Trump’s worst Cabinet member, and (2) why Trump’s trade war has been such a failure.
What Ross and his colleagues apparently still don’t understand is that modern manufacturing isn’t like manufacturing a couple of generations ago, when different countries’ industrial sectors were engaged in fairly straightforward head-to-head competition.
These days, we live in a world of global value chains. Much of any given nation’s imports consist not of consumer goods but of “intermediate” goods used as part of its own production process.
In such a world, anything that disrupts imports — whether tariffs or a virus — raises production costs. Indeed, a recent Federal Reserve study found that Trump’s tariffs, which were concentrated on intermediate goods, have reduced, not increased, manufacturing output and employment.
And while overall economic growth in 2019 was decent (not great), manufacturing is in a recession. (And the uncertainty created by the trade war may explain why business investment is down despite a huge cut in corporate taxes.)
If the virus seriously disrupts Chinese production, its impact on the U.S. economy will be like an extreme version of Trump’s trade war, except without any compensation in the form of tariff revenue.
If Ross’ boneheaded remarks are any indication, the Trump administration is even less prepared to deal with the fallout from a possible pandemic than it is to deal with the public health crisis. Be afraid.

Texto completo: President Trump did not waste any time Sunday night congratulating the Kansas City Chiefs for defeating the San Francisco 49ers in the Super Bowl.
Except he got their home state wrong.
“Congratulations to the Kansas City Chiefs on a great game, and a fantastic comeback, under immense pressure. You represented the Great State of Kansas" — yikes — “and, in fact, the entire USA, so very well," Trump said in a tweet posted during his Air Force One flight from Palm Beach, Fla., to Washington. “Our country is PROUD OF YOU."
The problem, of course, is that the Chiefs play in the state of Missouri, next door. There is a Kansas City, Kans. a handful of miles away, but it was the kind of mixup his followers might expect a member of the coastal elite to make, not a president who spends much of his time speaking on behalf of people from that part of the country.
The president's message, as short-lived as it was before it was deleted and replaced with the geographically correct location of the franchise, caught the attention of people on Twitter. One of them was Claire McCaskill, the former Democratic senator from Missouri. And she was not forgiving.
“It's Missouri you stone cold idiot," she wrote.
In the midst of fan celebrations and Twitter arguments over the president's grasp of geography, a new version of the first message suddenly appeared.
“Congratulations to the Kansas City Chiefs on a great game and a fantastic comeback under immense pressure," Trump wrote. “We are proud of you and the Great State of Missouri. You are true Champions!"

Lawmakers fight over S.C. interchange name
“President Donald J. Trump Interchange" or “President and First Lady Barack and Michelle Obama Interchange?" That is the soon-to-be fiercely debated question for state lawmakers in South Carolina whose preferences fall along clear partisan lines.
Each of the resolutions looks to name the junction of Interstate 85 and Interstate 385 near Greenville, where officials recently spent $300 million to build new bridges and untangle traffic. About 200,000 vehicles go through the area every day.
On Jan. 22, two Republicans introduced their resolution to name the interchange the “President Donald J. Trump Interchange."
Six days later, two Democrats introduced their resolution to name the same interchange the “President and First Lady Barack and Michelle Obama Interchange."
Both resolutions are up for a hearing Thursday.

Limbaugh says he's been diagnosed with lung cancer
Conservative radio host and Republican kingmaker Rush Limbaugh said he's been diagnosed with advanced lung cancer.
Addressing listeners on his program Monday, Limbaugh said he will take some days off for further medical tests and to determine treatment.
“I have to tell you something today that I wish I didn't have to tell you," announced Limbaugh, 69. The cancer diagnosis was confirmed by two medical institutions in late January after he experienced his only symptom so far, shortness of breath, on his Jan. 12 birthday weekend, he said.
The hyper-partisan broadcaster has dominated talk radio with a raucous, liberal-bashing style that made him one of the most influential voices of American right-wing politics and inspired other conservative broadcasters including Sean Hannity, Glenn Beck, and Bill O'Reilly.
Limbaugh has frequently been accused of hate-filled speech, including bigotry and blatant racism through his comments and sketches such as "Barack the Magic Negro," a song featured on his show that said Obama "makes guilty whites feel good" and that the politician is “black, but not authentically."

October criminal trial date set for Giuliani associates
An October trial date was set Monday for two associates of Rudy Giuliani who are charged with making illegal campaign contributions.
Lev Parnas was the only defendant among four men facing trial to be at a Manhattan courthouse when US District Judge J. Paul Oetken set the Oct. 5 trial date.
If the trial begins on time, it will occur a month before the presidential election.
Parnas was smiling and wearing an American-flag pin in court. Outside court, he declined to say if he was cooperating. He said he believes the truth will emerge.
Parnas and fellow defendant Igor Fruman had worked with Giuliani to try to convince Ukraine to announce an investigation of former vice president Joe Biden. Biden is seeking the Democratic presidential nomination.
Parnas and Fruman have pleaded not guilty to charges alleging they made illegal campaign contributions to further their business interests and political goals, including the campaign to get the US to replace Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch in Ukraine.
Parnas recently provided congressional investigators with a recording of an April 2018 dinner meeting in which Trump demanded her removal. She was subsequently removed.
Parnas attended the small dinner at his Washington hotel. The recording seemed to contradict the president's statements that he did not know Parnas.

Group hires Amnesty director as new CEO
The executive director of Amnesty International USA will take over as chief executive of the liberal watchdog Southern Poverty Law Center, which is trying to steady itself after months of turmoil that included the firing of its founder.
Margaret Huang, who has led Amnesty International for more than four years, will begin work in April at the Alabama-based nonprofit organization, which announced her hiring Monday.
The announcement came 11 months after the Southern Poverty Law Center fired its founder, Morris Dees, for unspecified reasons and its president, Richard Cohen, resigned. Other staffers also left, and the organization's employees voted to unionize in December.
The organization, which listed $492 million in assets on tax forms for 2018, said it has 350 employees in offices in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, Louisiana, and the District of Columbia.
The announcement about Huang's hiring touted her experience as a leader in the area of human and civil rights.
Karen Baynes-Dunning, a former judge, had served as head of the Southern Poverty Law Center on an interim basis.

Trump Iowa goal: Win general election while Democrats struggle through caucuses

Texto completo: DES MOINES -- In February 1984, President Ronald Reagan, assured of his party's nomination for re-election, nevertheless decided to fly to Iowa to hold two rallies, one in Waterloo and the other here in Des Moines, on the day Democrats held their presidential caucuses.
Reagan's move frustrated Democratic leaders. The state party chairman called the visit a "stunt" and "not worthy of a president." Another Democrat, speaking anonymously to the New York Times, said, "Let's face it: Reagan's media event will clobber our media event."
Fast forward more than three decades. Last summer, Jeff Kaufmann, chairman of the Iowa Republican Party, had a conversation with President Trump. "I reminded him that Ronald Reagan was in a very similar situation that he was -- an incumbent president who came to the Iowa caucuses and made a huge splash," Kaufmann told me. "It drove the Democrats nuts."
Kaufmann doesn't take sole credit for the idea; others may have suggested it, too. But the bottom line is that last Thursday, as the Democratic caucus campaign reached its peak, Air Force One flew into Iowa for a presidential rally at Drake University's Knapp Center in Des Moines. More than 7,000 people filled the center to capacity, with perhaps another 1,000 outside watching on a giant screen.
The president used the opportunity to mock his Democratic challengers, from Joe Biden to Bernie Sanders to Elizabeth Warren to Pete Buttigieg. "We're beating them all," he said. Like Reagan so many years before, he was messing with his opponents at a critical time.
But Trump was doing more than that. His visit was part of a carefully-planned campaign during the Iowa caucuses that focuses not on the caucuses but on the general election. Trump's campaign team knows well that Barack Obama won Iowa twice, in 2008 and 2012. Trump took it away from Democrats in 2016, and he will need to do it again in 2020.
So in addition to the visit, Trump is sending an A-list of his most prominent and reliable surrogates to spread across the state to speak at Monday's night's Republican caucuses. More than 80 of them, in fact, from the Trump family and the administration: Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump, Lara Trump, Kimberly Guilfoyle, campaign manager Brad Parscale, Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds, House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy, White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, Housing Secretary Ben Carson, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, GOP Representatives Steve Scalise, Kevin Brady, Jim Jordan, Rodney Davis, Mark Meadows, Elise Stefanik, Matt Gaetz, conservative leaders Ken Blackwell, Ralph Reed, Jerry Falwell, Jr., and a long list of Iowa state officials. And don't forget Mike Lindell, the My Pillow guy.
Trump is also ramping up his already-formidable social media presence around the caucuses. And then there are the phone calls, text messaging, and online advertising. In all, it will be a serious and unprecedented effort. In a similar situation in 2004, incumbent President George W. Bush did not do much in Iowa. The same for incumbent President Obama in 2012. But Trump is diving in.
"Monday's Iowa Republican caucuses will be the first time anyone in America will be able to express their preference for Donald Trump as president," said a senior campaign aide in a recent conversation. "This is a flexing of organizational muscles. The GOP caucuses are going to take place, so why not take the opportunity to make a show of force?"
Trump is not making the effort because he is afraid of his two hapless Republican challengers, former Rep. Joe Walsh and former Massachusetts Gov. William Weld. Both are in Iowa seeking GOP support, but both are up against the wall of Trump's popularity among Iowa Republicans. And they face an unsolvable problem: they are too anti-Trump for Republicans, and too Republican for Democrats. So they appeal to very few voters.
Still, Trump has something to prove. Given his success in the 2016 GOP race, it is easy to forget that he started out by losing the Iowa caucuses to Ted Cruz. So he wants to make up for that. But more importantly, he wants to cement Iowans' support for his re-election. Plus, he wants to take advantage of the increased intensity of support among Republicans who believe Trump has been treated unfairly by Democrats in Washington.
"It's a powerful one-two punch at a time when people think he's being treated unfairly with impeachment," said Jeff Kaufmann. "I think it's a knockout punch, to be honest with you."
A knockout punch in Iowa, that is. And if that is indeed the case, Trump will again capture the state's six electoral votes, which could be critical if the race is closer than 2016. So he is campaigning in Iowa in February, even with no threat in the caucuses.
The Trump effort is not a secret; after all, a presidential visit is not exactly under the radar. But the Democratic race is understandably receiving nearly all of the media coverage. So Trump has been able to make a major effort for the general election with very little controversy even as his Democratic rivals struggle to make it through their party's caucuses. The goal: Have a key swing state in the bag before Democrats even choose their candidate.

'Just trolling at this point': New York Times mocked for bringing back 'election needle' for Iowa caucuses

Texto completo: The New York Times was the butt of several jokes after announcing an "election needle" quartet to track the Iowa caucuses.
On Election Day in 2016, the New York Times only gave President Trump a 15% chance of winning the election. As the results started to roll in, its election needle slowly moved away from favoring Hillary Clinton and toward Trump in a visual that became representative of the latter’s surprising win.
For the Iowa caucuses being held on Monday night, the New York Times dusted off its election prediction needle, and three others, to cover the caucus results as they unfold live. In an explanation about the quartet of needles, the New York Times said it would need four needles to track the various rounds of the caucus.
The first needle will track which candidate is projected to win the most delegates throughout the state. Although multiple candidates could receive delegates to go to the nominating convention later this year, this needle only tracks who will win the most delegates.
The second needle will predict the first vote held before any realignments. In the Iowa caucuses, multiple rounds of voting are held, and the supporters of any candidate who does not earn 15% of a precinct's vote will choose a new candidate in the second round. The third needle will track the expected final alignment — when all of the low-turnout candidates are dropped.
The final needle will track the state delegate equivalents, or the predicted number of delegates each candidate will get to send to the Democratic National Convention set for mid-July in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
In the explanation, the report acknowledged the failed predictions of 2016 but claimed that the needle helped America “realize fairly early” on election night that Trump might win.
The abundance of election tracking needles was mocked by several Twitter users who found it humorous that the New York Times not only brought back the election needle but introduced three more as well.
TweetTweetTweetTweetTweetTweet
The New York Times has used the needle a few times since the 2016 election, including during the Alabama Senate race in 2017 and the midterm elections in 2018.

Pete Buttigieg is a fake centrist

Texto completo: Among the Democratic presidential candidates left standing in the waning days before the first caucus, Pete Buttigieg stands out. Not only is the former mayor the youngest of the group, with much less experience than the others, but if elected, he would be the first openly gay president. The novelty and diversity he brings to the stage is applauded by many in the Democratic Party. It's clear that Buttigieg is articulate and capable, despite his youth. As he campaigns against open radicals, he embraces the label of "moderate" placed on him by the media and voters alike.
But Buttigieg's moderate moniker is only a carefully crafted illusion.
Perhaps one reason Buttigieg is viewed as a left-leaning centrist is his short time on the national stage. Voters are well-acquainted with the extremism and eccentricities of Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. The mayor's measured personality makes him appear more politically balanced than older politicians who have been spouting untenable nonsense for years. A media that is desperate for a Democratic candidate to appeal to disaffected Republicans and independents try their hardest to support this narrative. Articles such as "How Harvard Made Pete Buttigieg the Moderate That Progressives Love to Hate," "Can Pete Buttigieg's moderate message win over purple Iowa?", and "Pete Buttigieg has risen to an Iowa contender by moving toward the middle" give one the impression that the young politician isn't a radical, but a reasonable politician with magic crossover appeal.
Buttigieg may not be as far-left as Warren, Sanders, and their supporters, but that doesn't say much. Sanders is a self-described socialist who would include Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez as a fixture in his administration. Meanwhile, Warren is touted as a radical by the New York Times editorial board, a body that also endorsed Sen. Amy Klobuchar as the more realist choice for president by comparison. In terms of current presidential candidates, you can't get more extreme than Sanders and Warren. That Buttigieg is to the right of them is no proof that he stands on the middle ground.
Of his campaign policies, the mayor promotes "Medicare for all who want it" as a "kinder" alternative that is supposed to appeal to a majority of the country, both insured and uninsured. But the plan, as explained on his website, is really just a precursor to "Medicare for all":
"This affordable public plan will incentivize private insurers to compete on price and bring down costs. If private insurers are not able to offer something dramatically better, this public plan will create a natural glide-path to Medicare for All."
In addition to his layered insurance plans, Buttigieg supports free college, the eventual elimination of the Electoral College (which he calls "undemocratic"), and, as voters were reminded of only recently, believes abortion is actual medical care that should be protected. All of his leanings are to the left, but Buttigieg's refusal to recognize the humanity of the unborn, while sanctimoniously chiding his audience, isn't unusual among his party; it's the norm. That is a clear indication that Buttigieg is extreme enough in his own right.
Heading into the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary, the Buttigieg campaign hopes the moderate mystique won't wear off. The mayor is all too happy to be seen as the centrist option for unsure voters who find the fanatical wing of the Democratic Party rather off-putting. Hidden under a very thin veil of marketing and media help is the heart of the Buttigieg campaign. It may be slick, articulate leftism that feigns a centrist bent, but make no mistake, Pete Buttigieg is as radical as the rest of the Democratic candidates.

Texto completo: Joe Biden received some bad news in an Iowa poll released hours before the state's first-in-the-nation caucus for the Democratic presidential primary.
The former vice president, 77, dropped 9 percentage points in the final survey of likely Iowa caucus-goers released Monday by Democratic Party pollster David Binder.
Former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, 38, took first place in the poll with 19% support, and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, 78, landed in second at 17%. Both have trended up since the last iteration of the poll in early January.
Biden fell to third with 15% support, tying with Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, 70. Both Biden's and Warren’s numbers in this poll show a downward trend in their support.
Binder's Jan. 28-30 poll has a relatively small sample size of 300 and bears a margin of error of 5.7 percentage points.
In the days leading up to the first-in-the-nation caucus, Biden’s campaign has slumped while some of his competitors have gained momentum, even as his competitors from the Senate, Sanders and Warren, have been pulled away from the campaign trail to participate in President Trump’s impeachment trial.
Sanders has been forced to leave much of his last-minute campaigning to surrogates such as New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Still, Sanders’s support seems to have remained energized and put the senator in the lead in Iowa in a New York Times/Siena College poll released on Jan. 25.
Biden, who generally leads in nationwide polls, has slipped in Iowa and trails Sanders in the RealClearPolitics polling average of Iowa polls by a margin of 23 points to 19 points. Buttigieg, who surged past both septuagenarians in Binder's poll, sits at roughly 17 points in the RealClearPolitics average.

'Uninformed idiots': Book agents reject claim that Victoria Coates is Anonymous author

Texto completo: Rumors circulating social media about the identity of the anonymous "resistance" opinion piece writer prompted a stern denial from the agents for the unnamed Trump administration official whose tell-all book came out last year.
In recent days, the guessing game for the identity of "Anonymous," which has already embroiled such high-profile officials such as Vice President Mike Pence and former Defense Secretary James Mattis, has a new target: deputy national security adviser Victoria Coates.
While Coates declined to comment for the story, Javelin Literary Agency co-founder Matt Latimer issued a statement to Politico denying she is the author of the book A Warning.
"To be very clear so there is no chance of any misunderstanding: Dr. Coates is not Anonymous,” Latimer said in a statement. “She does not know who Anonymous is. We have never discussed Anonymous or the book, A WARNING, with her prior to its publication. She did not write it, edit it, see it in advance, know anything about it, or as far we know ever read it.”
Latimer, who is a former aide to former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld along with co-founder Keith Urbahn, also criticized those who are spreading her name.
“This 'investigation' is based on innuendo, the irrelevant fact that she once worked with this agency on an art history book, and otherwise unprovable allegations — which are unprovable because they are not true,” Latimer said in a statement. “The fact that there is no real evidence has not stopped a whisper campaign against her to members of the press in the hope that someone would write a story. Nor has it stopped uninformed idiots from trying to out her on Twitter on Pavlovian command. As a result, her career is now at risk."
Latimer did not identify these "uninformed idiots," but among those who have been naming Coates as Anonymous is journalist and pro-Trump activist Jack Posobiec.
"New: Many around the White House are saying NSC official Victoria Coates authored Anonymous," Posobiec tweeted last week.
The latest round of frenetic speculation comes as impeachment, which began with an anonymous whistleblower complaint, winds down. Former national security adviser John Bolton, whom Democrats fought in vain to have as a Senate trial witness, also has a book coming out and is a client of Javelin. Bolton, along with Simon & Schuster and Javelin, released a statement last month to quash allegations that they were behind the leak, while some Republican Trump allies have accused the National Security Council, where the manuscript was submitted for review, of being the culprit.
Anonymous first made waves in September 2018 when the New York Times published an anonymous opinion piece by a senior member of the Trump administration, telling of an internal "resistance" group of officials working to stymie the president's worst inclinations.
Following the publication of the Times op-ed, a litany of Trump administration officials denied being the author, including Pence, Haley, and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. President Trump, who called the author "gutless" and questioned whether a "so-called 'Senior Administration Official'" really existed, even pushed then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions to investigate the source of the opinion piece.
A Warning was released on Nov. 19, seeking to tell voters "the truth" before the 2020 election. There were several explosive claims in the book that reflect poorly on Trump, including one that focuses on a group of high-level White House aides putting together a tally of Cabinet members they believed would support the use of the 25th Amendment to remove Trump from office. Another section of the book talks about how a group of senior Trump administration officials considered a "midnight self-massacre" in which they would resign together to draw attention to Trump's behavior.
It is unclear if the author is still a member of the Trump administration, but in a Reddit "Ask Me Anything" forum last year pledged to come forward. "Trump will hear from me, in my own name, before the 2020 election," Anonymous said.

Beating Trump in November is Democrats' last chance, and it's not looking good

Texto completo: Competition is usually fierce to publish the most worthless opinion on the New York Times opinion pages. But if we just want to count so far for this month, the prize definitely goes to Ross Douthat.
In his column on Saturday, Douthat confidently declared that while President Trump “may not be removable by the impeachment process,” there is another option for Democrats. “All you have to do is beat him.”
My goodness, why didn't anyone else think of that?
Douthat’s clarity through simplicity comes a little late, though. It’s a foregone conclusion that Trump will be acquitted in the Senate trial, leaving Democrats with nothing left but to hope they can defeat him in the election.
Every serious Democrat knows that’s a long shot for several reasons, and yet, Douthat repeated the line over and over again that “all you have to do is beat him,” as though this will be a cakewalk.
“Trump could have been stopped in the [2016] Republican primaries the old-fashioned way — by being beaten at the polls,” wrote Douthat. (Is that all it would have taken?!) “His base was limited, his popularity fluctuated, and if his rivals had recognized the threat earlier, campaigned against him consistently, strategized with one another more effectively, and avoided their own meltdowns and missteps, there was no reason he could not have been defeated.”
If the sun only didn’t shine on water, causing it to evaporate and form clouds, there’s no reason we couldn't permanently stop rain from falling!
Hey Democrats, Ross Douthat has some advice: avoid “meltdowns and missteps.” Oh, and if you could strategize with one another more effectively, that couldn’t hurt either.
More wisdom from Douthat: “A failed impeachment doesn’t give him new powers or new popularity; it just shows that the normal way to be rid of an unpopular president is the way that Democrats must take. All you have to do is beat him.”
Except, a failed impeachment may actually have given him new popularity. A new NBC-Wall Street Journal poll on Sunday shows that Trump’s national approval rating has gone up 2 points, from 44% to 46%, since mid-December, when the impeachment was at its fever pitch.
In that same poll, 36% of registered voters said they "strongly" approve of Trump’s performance. That's the best score Trump has gotten on that measure since the question was first asked in June 2017. It's up 3 points since mid-December and up 14 points from its all-time low in April 2018.
For context, Trump won in 2016 with an Election Day favorability rating of only 38%.
But don’t worry, all you have to do is beat him!

Texto completo: Billionaire Jeff Bezos is being sued by his girlfriend’s brother on charges of defamation after the National Enquirer revealed Bezos’s extramarital affair.
The lawsuit was filed on Friday by Michael Sanchez, the brother of Bezos’s girlfriend, Lauren Sanchez, 50, according to the New York Times. It targets both the Amazon CEO and his security consultant, Gavin de Becker, for allegedly telling journalists that Michael Sanchez had leaked “graphic” and “nude” photographs of Bezos to the National Enquirer.
The story in question was published in January 2019, and it included reproductions of sexual text messages between Bezos and Lauren Sanchez. The National Enquirer also said it had compromising photos of the 56-year-old billionaire, although the pictures were never published.
The story in the tabloid ended the marriage of Bezos and his wife of 25 years, Mackenzie Bezos. The split was amicable, with Jeff Bezos saying that he and Mackenzie Bezos, 49, would “continue our shared lives as friends.”
According to Michael Sanchez’s lawsuit, Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez began their affair in 2017 and “were guided in their decision to keep their relationship hidden by a psychic in New Mexico.”
Jeff Bezos has implied that Saudi Arabia might have been behind the leaked text messages after hacking his phone. The leak came after a Saudi hit team killed columnist Jamal Khashoggi, a dissident who worked for the Washington Post, which is owned by Jeff Bezos.
An analysis found with “medium to high confidence” that Jeff Bezos’s iPhone had been compromised after he received an infected message on WhatsApp, possibly sent by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. It isn’t clear if there is any connection between the National Enquirer story and the Saudi hack.
The National Enquirer’s publisher, American Media, said Michael Sanchez was the “single source” of the leak. Michael Sanchez reportedly gave American Media the texts and photographs for $200,000. Federal authorities investigated the matter, and American Media provided evidence that Michael Sanchez had got the text messages from his sister and then approached the tabloid.
Lauren Sanchez pushed back on the lawsuit and called the leaked messages an “unforgivable betrayal.”
“Michael is my older brother. He secretly provided my most personal information to the National Enquirer — a deep and unforgivable betrayal,” she said. “My family is hurting over this new, baseless, and untrue lawsuit, and we truly hope my brother finds peace.”
William Isaacson, Bezos’s lawyer, said that the billionaire “has chosen to address this lawsuit in court, and we will do that soon.”
Michael Sanchez’s lawyer, Enoch Liang, said the lawsuit “speaks for itself.”

Liberal media have idiotic meltdown over Trump’s Kansas City mistake

Texto completo: Did you know that the Kansas City Chiefs actually hail from Missouri?
You may not have — it’s a pretty easy mistake to make, to confuse the Kansas City Chiefs for a team based in Kansas. Their home base directly borders a city by the same name in Kansas, and they have many Kansans among their supporters. Still, President Trump’s first draft of his congratulatory tweet to the Super Bowl winners was technically inaccurate, because it congratulated Kansas, rather than Missouri. He corrected the error quickly and sent out a new tweet.
A simple, honest mistake like is no big deal, right? Most rational people would think this hardly a story. They'd laugh it off, much like people did when President Obama erroneously referenced a Navy corpsman as a "corpse man."
But no, this is Trump. So the liberal media had the exact opposite reaction and decided to choose this slightly erroneous tweet, of all things, as an anti-Trump hill to die on. TweetTweet
CNN “analyst” Chris Cillizza wrote an entire screed on “Why Donald Trump's 'Kansas' mistake absolutely matters.” Meanwhile, MSNBC contributor and former Democratic senator Claire McCaskill blasted Trump, saying “It’s Missouri you stone cold idiot.”
The New York Times decided this typo was worth an entire story, and the reporter who wrote it up, White House Correspondent Katie Rogers, decided to paint the error as “the kind of mix-up his followers might expect a member of the coastal elite to make, not a president who spends much of his time speaking on behalf of people from that part of the country.”
Yes, seriously. These are just a few examples of the hysteria that abounded in the light of the president’s tweet.
Good grief. This is actually the kind of error that any average person might make -- even someone from, say, Indiana or Michigan. Mistaking the Kansas City Chiefs as a Kansas team does not make someone an “idiot.” Getting mad about it does. And what’s representative of the “coastal elite” is the fact that so many members of the liberal media think anyone actually cares about the president making a mistake in a Super Bowl congratulatory tweet.
If anything, this kind of nonsense plays into Trump's narrative that he is the victim of a biased, out-of-touch media. Trump does indeed exaggerate this bias, and he goes too far for sure when he says the media are the "enemy of the people." But media outlets don't exactly help the industry's case when they pull these kinds of idiotic antics. Don't be surprised if Trump references this event in the future to bash the media at campaign events or speeches.
The media enoy extremely low trust among the public. I wonder why.

Fear of pandemic as deaths from coronavirus surpass SARS in China

Texto completo: The rapidly spreading coronavirus has killed more people in China than the SARS outbreak of 2002-03.
China's National Health Commission said on Sunday that the coronavirus, which has infected more than 17,000 people worldwide, has killed 362 people in mainland China, eclipsing the death toll from the severe acute respiratory syndrome that resulted in the deaths of 349 people in that country.
Although the coronavirus is spreading more rapidly than SARS, the mortality rate is lower. About 2% of those infected with coronavirus have died, compared to 9.6% from SARS.
Chinese stocks plummeted about 8% in value on Monday after the first trading since the Lunar New Year holiday in China began. The outbreak has caused the entire country to be on high alert and has shuttered stores and businesses across the mainland. Hundreds of thousands of people have been quarantined in cities in Hubei province, which is where the virus originated.
There are fears that the outbreak will become a pandemic, which is a disease that spreads across the globe.
“It's very, very transmissible, and it almost certainly is going to be a pandemic,” Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, told the New York Times. “But will it be catastrophic? I don’t know.”
Fauci also said on Friday that “there is no doubt” the coronavirus can spread to other people before symptoms set in, further exacerbating the infectious nature of the disease.
The World Health Organization declared the outbreak a global public health emergency, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed Thursday that there has been a case of human-to-human transmission in the United States, which has documented 11 cases of infection.
Although the official number of those infected worldwide sits at 17,489, experts say that the real number of cases is likely at 100,000 or more.

Texto completo: The Iowa presidential caucuses begin at 8 p.m. Eastern time at more than 1,600 sites across the state. The caucuses vary in length; small gatherings can be over in minutes, larger ones can last up to two hours.
The first results are expected at 8:30 p.m. Eastern time, with most results in hand by 11 p.m.
Seven Democratic candidates are mounting competitive campaigns in Iowa. They are Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusets, former Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana, Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, former tech executive Andrew Yang and former hedge fund investor Tom Steyer.
There will also be Republican caucuses, which President Donald Trump is expected to win handily.
Polls show an exceptionally fluid race among Sanders, Biden, Warren and Buttigieg, with Klobuchar trailing.
There are 41 delegates up for grabs, a tiny number considering a candidate needs 1,991 delegates to win the party’s presidential nomination. But Iowa is all about political momentum heading into the next contest: the New Hampshire primary Feb. 11.
A unique balloting system, a muddled race
With many voters split along ideological and generational lines, and others still undecided because they were not sure who would be their best chance to defeat Trump, any of the four leading candidates could plausibly win Iowa.
Those four candidates — Sanders, Warren, Biden and Buttigieg — campaigned across Iowa over the weekend, making their final pitches to voters and, in some cases, reigniting divisions that had surfaced in the party four years ago. Sanders, considered the one to beat based on recent polling, drew most of the fire.
Much of the uncertainty heading into Monday night stems from the unique nature of Iowa’s caucus system. Attendees can rally behind another candidate on a second ballot if their preferred choice does not claim 15% in the initial round.
It is those voters who will play the most pivotal role Monday. Sanders, for example, might garner the most overall votes on the first ballot, but if one of his rivals could amass enough support from the lesser candidates, he or she could vault past Sanders on the realignment round.
The key question, then, is where do the backers of Klobuchar, Steyer and Yang, who have all been polling below 15%, go on that second vote?
But it gets even more complicated. Caucusgoers can also stand as “Uncommitted.” So those most determined fence sitters could emerge as power brokers on the second ballot.
Welcome to Iowa — and hang on.
Sanders and Warren still circling each other
One of the more consequential sub-primaries of Monday’s contest is the race between Warren and Sanders to become the progressive standard bearer in the 2020 contest.
Sanders and Warren recently clashed over a private remark that she said he had made last year — telling her a woman could not win the White House — and that he denied. Although she played down the matter during the January debate, she confronted Sanders afterward in a scene captured on camera and a hot mic.
“You called me a liar,” Warren told Sanders.
That moment was the exception. For the most part, these two leading liberals in the race have stayed away from direct confrontation for the last year. That has partly been strategic. Sanders has a solid base, and Warren has sought to first grow her support without trying to take directly from him.
But make no mistake: The path to the Democratic nomination for both candidates involves eventually consolidating the base of the other, if not driving them from the race entirely.
And the first part of that primary within the primary begins Monday.
Whoever finishes first in Iowa will then have momentum — and likely a financial boost — heading into New Hampshire and beyond.
Why voter age could be a factor
One of the biggest predictors of who will finish first, second and third will be not just who votes but also how old those voters are.
Age has been one of the biggest divides in the 2020 race, especially between Biden and Sanders. Young voters have generally swooned for Sanders and old voters have flocked to Biden.
The New York Times/Siena College poll last month showed Sanders, 78, carrying a sizable 40% of voters younger than 30. That was the highest percentage for any candidate for any age group. Support for the Vermont senator declined in each successively older age bracket down to single digits — 9% — among those who are 65 or older.
It was the opposite story for Biden, 77, who captured a 32% plurality of those who were 65 or older. His worst group was younger voters younger than 30. He carried only 10% of such voters.
The same split has been present in poll after poll. The Des Moines Register/CNN poll in early January showed Sanders with 38% of voters younger than 50 — and Biden with 37% of voters older than 65.
Typically, older people are more reliable voters. But caucuses are different, and much of the differences in polls that show different leaders can be traced to different projected models of who will actually turn out Monday.
County chairs predict a Sanders victory
The leaders of Iowa’s county Democrats are a group that has long been in search of a candidate to fall in love with. Since 2018, they have harbored suspicions about septuagenarian candidates and have longed for somebody fresh and new.
And now many of them think that Sanders, a member of Congress for three decades, is going to win the Iowa caucuses.
In conversations last weekend with 24 of 99 county chairs, 14 said they believed Sanders would place first in Monday night’s caucuses. Six predicted Biden would win, while four said they still could not say who would win.
“I suspect that Bernie will end up in first place, as the polling indicates,” said Nathan Thompson, party chairman in Winneshiek County. “It’s consistent with what I’ve seen in northeast Iowa.”
Several acknowledged that their favorite candidate was not likely to win.
Marjie Foster, the Decatur County chairwoman, said she planned to caucus for Klobuchar but predicted she would finish behind Sanders and Buttigieg.
Terry Kocher, the Humboldt County chairman, said he expected Biden to win but was hoping that Buttigieg, for whom he will caucus, did well.
And Rachel Bly, a co-chairwoman in Poweshiek County east of Des Moines, predicted a split decision, with one candidate taking the most delegates and another winning the most raw votes.
“Sanders has pockets of support, but won’t necessarily carry the rural areas or get delegates in as many places as some of the others,” she said. “He may win the numbers game, but not the delegate game.”
Will candidates drop out after Iowa?
Iowa traditionally winnows the field, extinguishing the hopes of more than one candidate. But with so many Democratic hopefuls dropping out in the lead up to the caucuses, few in the party expect to see more than one contender quit after Monday night. And even that may be overstating it.
With each of the major candidates having already qualified for the debate Friday in New Hampshire, and the state’s primary taking place on the following Tuesday, the challengers will likely want to at least give that state a shot.
So what will be the impact of Iowa? It will reward the winner, giving him or her a shot of momentum and a burst of contributions.
But the bigger impact of the caucuses this year could be who they hurt.
Klobuchar has been to all of Iowa’s 99 counties and needs a strong showing to continue in the race; Buttigieg has surged with the state’s heavily white electorate but without a solid performance may not be able to find his footing in more diverse states later this month; Warren has spent considerable time in the state and also needs liftoff here because of her relatively weak standing in the coming states.
And Biden will go on if he finishes out of the top two in Iowa but he will have missed his best early opportunity to take command of the race — and may find it hard to find his footing in New England, home to two of his rivals.

Texto completo: Jennifer Lopez and Shakira restored sparkle and spectacle to the Super Bowl halftime show on Sunday night with headlining sets heavy on Latin pride, a year after the pop-rock band Maroon 5 performed an anodyne set with the rapper Travis Scott that seemed to please nobody.
Lopez, 50, took an athletic, dance-heavy spin through hits from her 21-year career in pop music, from “Jenny From the Block” to “On the Floor,” with a guest appearance from the Colombian reggaeton star J Balvin for his track “Mi Gente.” Lopez spun atop a pole for “Waiting for Tonight” (showing off skills from her role in “Hustlers”) and brought out a children’s chorus for “Let’s Get Loud" that included the singer’s daughter, Emme.
Shakira, 43, likewise reached back through her discography, which began in her native Colombia in the early 1990s and broke through in the United States with her 2001 album “Laundry Service”: “She Wolf,” “Whenever, Wherever” and “Chantaje.” She seized an electric guitar for “Empire” and crowd-surfed before “Hips Don’t Lie.” The Puerto Rican pop sensation Bad Bunny, draped in a silver coat, joined her to perform his verse from Cardi B’s “I Like It.”

The performance, at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida, was the first halftime show since the partnership between the NFL and Jay-Z’s Roc Nation began. Some of pop’s most prominent black artists rebuffed the NFL last year in the wake of controversy over how the league handled players, most notably Colin Kaepernick, kneeling or sitting during the national anthem to protest racial injustice and police brutality.
“The NFL has a great big platform, and it has to be all-inclusive,” Jay-Z said when the deal was announced last August. The partnership involves Roc Nation serving as the NFL’s “live music and entertainment strategist” and contributing to its activism campaign, Inspire Change.
Lopez and Shakira marked a return to the female pop extravaganzas of the past decade at the Super Bowl — Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Beyoncé and Madonna have all headlined since 2012. Bruno Mars and the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Coldplay (with Beyoncé and Bruno Mars) and Justin Timberlake performed sets with varying degrees of spectacle in between.

Texto completo: At this point, the Democratic presidential nomination is very much up in the air. Not only is it unclear who will be the nominee; it’s unclear whether the nominee will be a centrist like Joe Biden or Amy Klobuchar, or a representative of the party’s left like Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren. Whoever wins, there will be much wailing and gnashing of teeth from the other side.
So I’d like to offer an opinion that will probably anger everyone: In terms of actual policy, it probably doesn’t matter much who the Democrats nominate — as long as he or she wins, and Democrats take the Senate too.
If you’re a centrist worried about the gigantic spending increases Sanders has proposed, calm down, because they won’t happen. If you’re a progressive worried that Biden might govern like a Republican, you should also calm down, because he wouldn’t.
In practice, any Democrat would probably preside over a significant increase in taxes on the wealthy and a significant but not huge expansion of the social safety net. Given a Democratic victory, a much-enhanced version of Obamacare would almost certainly be enacted; “Medicare for All,” not so much. Given a Democratic victory, Social Security and Medicare would be protected and expanded; Paul Ryan-type cuts wouldn’t be on the table.
Why do I say this? Consider first the lessons from three years of Donald Trump.
In 2016 Trump ran as a different kind of Republican, promising that unlike other candidates, he wouldn’t slash social programs and cut taxes on the rich. But it was all a lie. Aside from his trade war, Trump’s economic policies have been straight right-wing orthodoxy: huge tax cuts for corporations and the wealthy, attempts to take health care away from tens of millions of Americans. And lately he has been talking about possible cuts to Social Security and Medicare.
The point is that even though Trump commands humiliating personal subservience from his party, he hasn’t caused any significant shift in its policy priorities.
Now, the Democratic Party is very different from the GOP — it’s a loose coalition of interest groups, not a monolithic entity answering to a handful of billionaires allied with white nationalists. But this if anything makes it even harder for a Democratic president to lead his or her party very far from its political center of gravity, which is currently one of moderate progressivism.
It’s still far from clear who will come out on top in the primary, but it’s enough to think about what would happen if either of the two current front-runners, Bernie Sanders or Joe Biden, were to become president — and also have strong enough coattails to produce a Democratic Senate, because otherwise nothing will happen.
Sanders has a hugely ambitious agenda; Medicare for All is just part of it. Paying for that agenda would be difficult — no, Modern Monetary Theory wouldn’t actually do away with the fiscal constraint. So turning Sanders’ vision into reality would require large tax increases, not just on the wealthy, but on the middle class; without those tax increases it would be highly inflationary.
But not to worry: It won’t happen. Even if he made it to the White House, Sanders would have to deal with a Congress (and a public) considerably less radical than he is and would be obliged to settle for a more modest progressive agenda.
It’s true that Sanders enthusiasts believe that they can rally a hidden majority of Americans around an aggressively populist agenda and in so doing also push Congress into going along. But we had a test in the midterm elections: Progressives ran a number of candidates in Trump districts, and if even one of them had won they would have claimed vindication for their faith in transformative populism. But none did; the sweeping Democratic victory came entirely from moderates running conventional campaigns.
The usual take on this progressive setback is that it raises questions about Sanders’ electability. But it also has a very different implication: Moderates worried about a radical presidency should cool it. A President Sanders wouldn’t be especially radical in practice.
What about Biden? The Sanders campaign has claimed that Biden endorsed Ryan’s plans for sharp cuts in Social Security and Medicare; that claim is false. What is true is that in the past Biden has often been a Very Serious Person going along with the Beltway consensus that we need “adjustments” — a euphemism for at least modest cuts — in Social Security. (Actually, if you go back a ways, Sanders turns out to have said similar things.)
But the Democratic Party as a whole has moved left on these issues, and Biden has moved with it. Even if he has a lingering desire to strike a Grand Bargain with Republicans — which I doubt — he would face such a huge intraparty backlash that he would be forced to back off.
So in terms of policy, here’s what I think would happen if Sanders wins: We’ll get a significant but not gigantic expansion of the social safety net, paid for by significant new taxes on the rich.
On the other hand, if Biden wins, we’ll get a significant but not gigantic expansion of the social safety net, paid for by significant new taxes on the rich.
One implication, if I’m right, is that electability should play a very important role in your current preferences. It matters hugely whether a Democrat wins; it matters much less which Democrat wins.
But my main point is that Democrats should unify, enthusiastically, behind whoever gets the nomination. Any moderate tempted to become a Never Bernie type should realize that even if you find Sanders too radical, his actual policies would be far more tempered. Any Sanders enthusiast tempted to become a Bernie or Bust type should realize that these days even centrist Dems are pretty progressive, and that there’s a huge gap between them and Trump’s GOP.
Oh, and all the Democrats believe in democracy and rule of law, which is kind of important these days.

Texto completo: El comentarista conservador Rush Limbaugh anunció este lunes a su audiencia que fue diagnosticado con “cáncer de pulmón avanzado”.
El locutor de 69 años , uno de los más escuchados en Estados Unidos , advirtió a los oyentes que tendrá ausencias temporales mientras recibe tratamiento. El anuncio lo hizo al final de su intervención del lunes.
Relacionado: Juicio clave para Trump tendrá lugar semanas antes de las elecciones de 2020
“Sentí que tenía que decirlo porque ese es el tipo de relación que siento que tengo con ustedes en la audiencia”, dijo Limbaugh. “A lo largo de los años, mucha gente ha sido muy amable, me dicen cuánto ha significado este programa para ellos pero, sea lo que sea, palidece en comparación con lo que todos ustedes han significado para mí”.
El comentarista es conocido por posturas duras en materia migratoria . En junio pasado comparó la llegada de inmigrantes a la frontera con el desembarco de tropas de Estados Unidos en Francia durante la Segunda Guerra Mundial.
Limbaugh calificó de invasión a la llegada de los migrantes desde Centroamérica. Medios como el New York Times reportaron que el tirador de la masacre de El Paso hizo eco a las palabras de Limbaugh sobre la caravana.
En 2018, el locutor propuso dar ciudadanía estadounidense a los indocumentados a cambio de que no tengan derecho al voto por 25 años.
En 2005 llamó a los inmigrantes mexicanos especies invasoras.

Dowd: Donald Trump, unrepentant and unleashed

Texto completo: During a meeting with Donald Trump at Trump Tower in June 2016, with the opéra bouffe builder improbably heading toward the nomination despite a skeletal campaign crew on a floor below, I asked when he would pivot.
We all assumed he would have to pivot, that he would have to stop his belittling Twitter rants, that he would have to cease attacking fellow Republicans like John McCain, that he would have to get more in line with the traditional stances of his party, that he would have to be less of a barbarian at the gates of D.C.
He crossed his arms, pursed his lips and shook his head — a child refusing vegetables.
How naive he was, I thought to myself. But I was the naive one. Trump has forced the world to pivot to him.
The state of the union is upside down and inside out and sauerkraut. Trump has changed literally everything in the last three years, transforming and coarsening the game. On Friday night, he became, arguably, the most brutishly powerful Republican of all time. Never has a leader had such a stranglehold on his party, subsuming it with one gulp.
As the Senate voted 51-49 to smother the impeachment inquiry, guided by the dark hand of Mitch McConnell, it felt like the world’s greatest deliberative body had been hollowed out, diminished.
McConnell let Mitt Romney and Susan Collins vote to allow documents and witnesses such as John Bolton, knowing two could strain at the leash safely.
The rest of the senators fell into line as sycophantic clones of Mike Pence. The impeachment trial amounted to one side being earnest and one pretending to be. It was exactly what Nancy Pelosi feared would happen before she was reluctantly drawn into the show trial.
“Now the State of the Union is going to be the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man coming down the street and standing in the rubble of what’s left of the Congress,” keened one Democrat on Friday night. “The Republican Party has now lost whatever control they could exert over this president, any oversight they could have. It’s gone. The state of the union is there is no union. How can there be when one side is petrified of their Godzilla?”
Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Connecticut, dismissed Republicans as “a cult of personality” around Trump.
“This trial in so many ways crystallized the completely diametrically opposed threats that Democrats and Republicans see to the country,” Murphy told Nicholas Fandos of the New York Times. “We perceive Donald Trump and his corruption to be an existential threat to the country. They perceive the deep state and the liberal media to be an existential threat to the country.
“That dichotomy, that contrast, has been growing over the last three years, but this trial really crystallized that difference. We were just speaking different languages, fundamentally different languages when it came to what this trial was about. They thought it was about the deep state and the media conspiracy. We thought it was about the president’s crimes.”
I feel like I have spent my career watching the same depressing dynamic that unspooled Friday night: Democrats trying, sometimes ineptly, to play fair, and Republicans ruthlessly trying to win.
I watched it with the Anita Hill-Clarence Thomas hearings. I watched it in the 2000 recount with Bush versus Gore. I watched it with the push by W., Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld to go to war in Iraq. I watched it with the pantomime of Merrick Garland.
Democrats are warning Republicans that they will be judged harshly by history. But in the meantime, the triumphant Republicans get to make history. And a lot of the history that Republicans have made is frightening: the endless, futile wars, the obliviousness to climate change, the stamp on the judiciary.
As Carl Hulse of the New York Times writes in his book, “Confirmation Bias,” about the Garland fiasco: “The success in naming judges was the signal achievement of Trump’s first two years. In the coming years, those judges will be among the members of the federal bench called to rule on Trump’s policies and practices in cases arising from challenges initiated by increasingly confrontational Democrats and other legal adversaries around the nation. Mitch McConnell made a snap decision one night in 2016. The consequences will reverberate for decades.”
For hours Friday, the House managers made their vain final arguments. Pressing for Bolton’s testimony, Val Demings implored Republican senators: Aren’t you worried that, if left in office, Trump will harm America’s national security, seek to corrupt the upcoming election and undermine our democracy to further his own personal gain? Don’t you want to hear the witnesses and see the documents that would give the full story and make this a fair trial rather than a mock one?
“This is the American way and this is the American story,” Demings told the Republican senators as they looked back at her, impassive or impatient.
But, of course, they didn’t want that. As he voted against witnesses and documents, Lamar Alexander, McConnell’s pal, said Trump did something inappropriate but they just did not accept that it was impeachable, and they did not want to tear up ballots and “pour gasoline on cultural fires that are burning out there.”
So why not shut it down and cover it up? The books were cooked from the start.
As with so many other pivotal moments in modern history, Republicans wanted to win, not look for the truth. And history, God help us, is written by the winners.

Amid coronavirus outbreak, Mass. businesses face uncertainty

Texto completo: The coronavirus that has sparked panic across the world since emerging in Central China at the end of December has added an element to businesses that their executives absolutely hate — uncertainty.
The parallel they might draw from — the 2003 SARS crisis — delivered a relatively small blow, cutting economic growth by an estimated 0.1 percent. But the world is a different place today, giving many executives reason to worry that this epidemic could be worse.
China has gone from the sixth-largest economy at the start of this century to second largest. And Massachusetts employers — from high-tech manufacturers to high-end hotels to institutions of higher education — are more tightly linked to China's than ever before.
That has raised the stakes and left local companies vulnerable as China shuts factories and workplaces, and the United States and other countries restrict travel to and from the country. Employers contacted by The Boston Globe said they had taken steps to protect their employees who travel to or work in China, but few would discuss how Beijing's efforts to contain the outbreak might disrupt their operations.
“It's really about uncertainty about the future that is already pretty substantial," said Michael Goodman, a professor of public policy at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth and co-editor of MassBenchmarks, a collaboration between the Donahue Institute at UMass and the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston that tracks the state's economy.
He said the coronavirus has complicated planning for executives still concerned about tariffs, the ripple effects of Brexit, and ongoing tensions in the Middle East.
Economists said that Chinese industrial production and consumer spending will invariably be curbed by the health crisis, though to what degree and for how long isn't clear. China's main stock market index plunged 7.7 percent on Monday, the first day of trading after an extended Lunar New Year holiday.
But it's too soon to calculate the financial impact on local companies or the economy. For now, most economists expect any losses to be modest and short-lived.
“The problem is that too much is unknown" about the illness and how dramatically it will slow China's economy, said Megan Greene, a senior fellow at Mossavar-Rahmani Center for Business and Government at Harvard's Kennedy School.
Greene said that US companies that sell products in China likely will be hurt by a drop off in demand, and those that buy parts or rely on Chinese factories may have supply problems.
Riverdale Mills chief executive Jim Knott said he was concerned enough to check in on two factories in China where his company sources fine wire to make finished products such as chicken wire. One factory was operating, but another was shut down by the government for at least 10 days because of the virus.
“It's definitely going to impact us. These are products we order on a regular basis," said Knott. “I suspect some delays in the supply chain."
As a result, the Northbridge manufacturer of welded wire mesh is now looking to buy fine wire from Mexico or another Latin American country.
John Hancock, like many other companies, said it suspended all but essential travel to and from mainland China and imposed reviews and restrictions for other travel in the rest of Asia.
“Those who have recently traveled to mainland China are being asked to work from home for 14 days before returning to an office," the company said in a statement.
China was the Massachusetts's second-largest trading partner in 2018, eclipsing Germany, Japan, and the United Kingdom over the previous decade, data from the World Institute for Strategic Economic Research show. Exports to China reached $2.64 billion that year — almost double the amount in 2009 — led by computers and other electronic gear, machinery, and chemicals.
Moreover, China is the biggest source of foreign students for area universities such as Northeastern, Boston University, and Harvard, according to the 2019 Open Doors Report on International Education Exchange. The country is also the top source of tourists for Boston.
The region's tourism market could be facing a disastrous 2020 the longer recently announced flight bans to China by airlines including American stay in place. According to the Greater Boston Visitors & Convention Bureau, the average Chinese tourist stayed in Boston hotels an average of 10 nights in 2017.
Several hotels declined to comment, but one general manager from a four-star property, who asked not to be identified, said there have been several cancellations over the past two weeks and bookings for the spring are down.
Despite the potential losses, Boston's hotels may get a small bump from the pandemic. According to Boston Park Plaza marketing director Suzanne Wenz, the hotel is starting to see interest from groups looking to relocate meetings previously booked in China.
Boston Scientific, the Marlborough medical device maker, has asked its nearly 1,000 employees in China to work from home, according to Kate Haranis, a company spokeswoman. “Impact has been minimal so far, but we continue to monitor and prepare as the situation evolves," she said.
Takeda Pharmaceutical, which is based in Japan and has about 5,000 employees in Massachusetts, has told its 2,303 employees in China, including 63 in Wuhan, that its offices in that country will be closed until at least Feb. 10.
Wayfair, the online home goods retailer that sells many Chinese made products, said its business hasn't been impacted so far.
General Electric chief executive Larry Culp addressed the China outbreak on the Boston company's quarterly earnings call with investors last week.
He said the company's health care division “is really in the smack in the middle of this in Wuhan and elsewhere, servicing our equipment, certainly prioritizing new equipment deliveries, particularly to the Wuhan hospitals."
After the SARS outbreak ended in mid-2003, business quickly returned to normal. For now, analysts expect the same outcome with the coronavirus crisis.
“Generally these episodes disrupt temporarily, not permanently," said Jurrien Timmer, director of global macro at Fidelity Investments.
Shirley Leung, Christopher Muther, Jonathan Saltzman, and Janelle Nanos of the Globe staff contributed to this report.

Texto completo: The Supreme Court last week lifted a nationwide injunction against Trump administration regulations imposing tougher standards for aliens attempting to prove that they won't become "public charges." Under the old guidelines, established during the Clinton era, only cash assistance or long-term institutional care could be considered strikes against applicants. Only a few hundred applicants were refused under the public charge provision world-wide each year.
The new rules will allow immigration officials to consider noncash benefits such as food stamps, Medicaid and housing vouchers in evaluating whether an alien would be a public charge in the U.S. Cue the outrage. "Supreme Court Allows Trump's Wealth Test for Green Cards," read the headline of a New York Times news story. "Public charge is racist," tweeted Rep. Mike Pocan (D., Wis.). Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tweeted: "The American dream isn't a private club with a cover charge."
As a foreign-service officer during the George W. Bush administration, I witnessed how lax public-charge standards led to the admission of aliens who were likely to be dependent on government assistance. As for the new rules, they are nowhere near as draconian as critics suggest:
• Contrary to Mr. Pocan's racism claim, the rules place no special burden on nonwhite migrants. In my first tour, I dealt primarily with poor, white Kosovars; in my second, with mostly black applicants from Trinidad. Both times, I encountered many poorly qualified applicants who were likely to use benefits in the U.S., but we were discouraged from rejecting anyone under the public-charge provision of the law.
• The new restrictions don't apply to immigrants who already have green cards, or to refugees and asylum seekers. Only applicants who have relied on welfare programs for an aggregate period of at least 12 months in the most recent three-year period will be considered potential public charges. Use of programs before the introduction of the new rules on Oct. 15, 2019, won't count. There are also exemptions for children, pregnant women, those serving in the U.S. military and those who obtained Medicaid while treating a medical emergency.
• The public-charge rules don't apply only to immigrants, but also to those seeking to extend nonimmigrant visas, such as tourists and students.
• Homeland Security and State Department officials don't have access to databases that would allow them to check if an applicant has secured food stamps or other benefits, so only applicants honest enough to self-report welfare use will be affected.
• The new regulations specifically state that aliens won't be declared public charges based on a single strike against them—such as having received food stamps in the past—but rather "on the totality of the circumstances presented in an applicant's case," which could include mitigating factors, such as an applicant's new job or improved financial situation.
The risk that legal aliens will become public charges is real. Most immigrants come to the U.S. based on "family preference" immigrant visas and are required to have sponsors, who are, in theory, supposed to ensure their foreign relatives don't become public charges. In my experience, the income requirements for sponsorship are remarkably lenient. A naturalized citizen with a household income of only $21,137 can sponsor another immigrant.
Despite those modest income requirements, most of the thousands of sponsors I encountered didn't make enough to qualify (or at least didn't report enough income on their taxes). In these cases, applicants are allowed to secure a co-sponsor—anyone willing to sign an affidavit of support that is rarely if ever enforced.
Many of the immigrants I interviewed were poorly prepared, with little English and without the skills and experience American employers would require. Many do find work, but it tends to be low-paying and without benefits. The Migration Policy Institute, which opposes the new rules, estimates "that a majority of future applicants from Latin America and Africa could be denied under the new test." If this is true, it is a powerful case for a merit-based immigration system.
Under the new rule, immigration officials will retain the ability to look at many factors in assessing immigrants' qualifications. Very few of those who enforce U.S. immigration laws want to prevent migrants from coming to the country. I certainly didn't. But the desire to let people in needs to be balanced against an obligation to uphold the law and protect the interests of taxpayers. According to the Census Bureau, about 1 in 8 Americans lives below the poverty line. Until Congress enacts a merit-based immigration system, the tougher public-charge rules are the best tool for ensuring that immigration makes America richer rather than poorer.

Trump bashes Democratic rivals during pre-Super Bowl show

Texto completo: President Trump used a Super Bowl pregame interview to rail against Democrats, accusing them of hatred and offering schoolyard insults about his potential 2020 rivals.
“I see the hatred. . . . They don't care about fairness, they don't care about lying," Trump said in a taped interview with Fox News Channel's Sean Hannity, which aired on Fox hours before sports' biggest night of the year.
Trump spent his weekend in Florida as most of the political world has been focused on Iowa, where Democrats on Monday cast their first votes to choose the party's nominee.
Prompted by Hannity, Trump went through most of the major candidates one by one, deriding “Sleepy Joe" Biden, the former vice president, accusing Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren of telling “fairy tales," and labeling Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist, as “a communist," even though he's not.
But Trump seemed most preoccupied by the candidates who has chosen to skip the early-voting states: Michael Bloomberg, the former New York mayor who has been blanketing the airwaves with anti-Trump ads.
The president's campaign and Bloomberg's were planning to run dueling, multimillion-dollar ads during Sunday night's game.
In the Fox interview, Trump accused Bloomberg, who is widely reported to be 5 feet, 8 inches tall, of making a special request for a box to stand on if he qualifies for future presidential debates. Bloomberg's campaign denies that is the case.
“Why should he get a box to stand on?" Trump asked. “Why should he be entitled to that, really? Then does that mean everyone else gets a box?"
Bloomberg campaign spokeswoman Julie Wood said Trump was "lying."
“He is a pathological liar who lies about everything: his fake hair, his obesity, and his spray-on tan," she said.
A Democratic official said there have been no discussions about the topic, noting that Bloomberg has yet to qualify for a debate.

Trump campaign and RNC spent $9m in fourth quarter
President Trump's campaign and the Republican National Committee together spent more than $9 million on polling, digital ads, and fees paid to Trump-owned properties in the last three months of 2019, according to filings with the Federal Election Commission released Friday.
The filings detail how the Trump campaign, the Trump Victory committee, a third entity called the Trump Make America Great Again Committee, and the national party committee spent their cash from October through the end of December. Together, they previously reported raising $154 million over those months and closed the year with $195 million in cash on hand.
The Trump apparatus has raised an outsize sum, but it has faced questions about how, exactly, it is spending its reserves. Even though he is not funding his own bid this time around, Trump has repeatedly grilled his advisers about where and how they are spending money.
According to a New York Times analysis, the biggest expenditure in the final three months of the year was on digital advertising. From October to December, the campaign spent more than $6 million on digital ads. The T-MAGA committee spent another $3.2 million on digital ads.
The campaign also spent $525,000 on polling in that period. The Republican National Committee spent $2.2 million on polling.
The Trump campaign spent about $194,000 at Trump-owned properties. The filings show that the groups supporting Trump's reelection together made 150 separate payments to Trump-owned entities and properties, totaling nearly $600,000 for the three-month period, and $1.7 million for the year.

GOP lawmaker: Constitution says it's OK to shoot socialists
Representative Rodney Garcia, a state lawmaker in Montana, told a roomful of Republicans he believes the US Constitution says socialists can be jailed or shot simply for being socialists. Garcia initially made the statement at an election event, then he reiterated it to a Billings Gazette reporter.
The Republican Party in Montana swiftly rebuked him.
Garcia's assertion first came Friday night, after former interior secretary Ryan Zinke gave a speech at the party event in Helena. According to reporting from the Gazette, Garcia said he was concerned there were socialists "everywhere" in Billings, which he represents in House District 52.
Billings Gazette reporter Holly Michels later asked Garcia to clarify his remarks, and the lawmaker doubled down.
"So actually in the Constitution of the United States, [if you] are found guilty of being a socialist member you either go to prison or are shot," Garcia told Michels.
Garcia was not able to say where he finds that in the Constitution, the Billings Gazette reported.
Garcia did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Washington Post.

High-profile Iowa poll won't be releasedThe Des Moines Register and CNN have decided not to release the final installment of their presidential preference poll, fearing its results may have been compromised. Carol Hunter, the executive editor of the Iowa newspaper, posted the announcement Saturday night at the same time the results of the highly anticipated survey were supposed to be released.Hunter said that one of the poll respondents reported concerns earlier in the day, which raised questions about the integrity of the results."It appears a candidate's name was omitted in at least one interview in which the respondent was asked to name their preferred candidate," Hunter wrote in an article posted on the Register's website.“While this appears to be isolated to one surveyor, we cannot confirm that with certainty. Therefore, the partners made the difficult decision to not to move forward with releasing the Iowa Poll." Associated Press

Hillary was right about the basket

Texto completo: Surely you remember the "basket of deplorables."
That was Hillary Clinton's 2016 characterization of some Donald Trump supporters. Observers saw it as a major gaffe, and conservatives erupted in hot, "How dare you!" indignation at the idea there was anything deplorable about voting for a lying, racist, misogynistic, vagina-grabbing deadbeat.
Few people, if any, dared point out the obvious. Which is that Clinton was right.
Well, welcome to déjà vu all over again. Recently on CNN, Don Lemon presided over a segment about Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who recently blew up at an NPR reporter for having the temerity to ask him about Ukraine. The reporter says Pompeo challenged her to find that country on a map, which she did. Panelist Rick Wilson, a former GOP strategist, opined that Pompeo "knows deep within his heart that Donald Trump couldn't find Ukraine on a map if you had the letter U and a picture of an actual physical crane next to it."
At which Lemon started laughing and could not stop. He lowered his head to the desk as Wilson and a second panelist, New York Times columnist Wajahat Ali, adopted dumb rube accents in mockery of Trump supporters.
Wilson: "Donald Trump's the smart one - and y'all elitists are dumb!"
Ali: " 'You elitists with your geography and your maps - and your spelling!' "
TrumpWorld was predictably, if hypocritically, outraged. Lemon would later assert that he was laughing only at the initial joke and that he didn't hear - and disavows - the mockery. But the Poynter Institute, among other journalism professionals, was unpersuaded. It called Lemon's behavior "unprofessional," and added that, "Bending over and laughing until you cry while being oblivious to what your guests are doing was not a good look for Lemon. It was an even worse look for CNN."
You'll get no argument here. Lemon's attack of the tee-hee-hees reflected poorly on him, his employer and his profession.
But Lemon's response to it aside, Wilson and Ali's jokes - riffing as it does not just on TrumpWorld's ignorance, but on its hostility to knowledge - strikes a chord. Consider an anecdote from the new book "A Very Stable Genius" by Philip Rucker and Carol Leonnig. It's about Trump's visit to a sacred American shrine, the USS Arizona Memorial at Pearl Harbor. He's on the boat, being ferried out to this iconic site, and he pulls then-chief of staff John Kelly aside. "Hey, John, what's this all about?" he asks. "What's this a tour of?"
Maybe if it were a one-off, you could ignore it. But from his disinterring of Frederick Douglass to the creative spellings of his tweets to his geographic gaffes ("We just got back from the Middle East," he once announced - in Israel) Trump produces daily, glaring and incontrovertible evidence of his intellectual dullness.
Which, in TrumpWorld, will cost him absolutely nothing. Small wonder. A 2015 survey by the Pew Research Center found that among Americans with college and post-graduate degrees, progressives outpace conservatives by a wide margin.
In other words, the right is less well educated. In Trump, they've found someone who validates their inchoate biases and fears - and they don't much care that he doesn't know what happened at Pearl Harbor.
If you happen to be one of those crazy folks who thinks knowing stuff is good - especially on the world stage - that's frightening. And it lends a certain perspective to Lemon's lapses. Once again, a side issue takes center stage.
And the obvious goes unsaid.

Boomer criticism: ‘We can take it'

Texto completo: When Leonard Steinhorn hosted Thanksgiving at his Washington apartment in November, a friend and fellow baby boomer surprised the 20-somethings in attendance with special gifts: T-shirts printed with the viral put-down "OK boomer."

Generation Z's mocking dismissal of out-of-touch old people had ricocheted across the internet earlier that month, and playing it up in front of Steinhorn doubled as a good-natured inside joke: The longtime American University communication professor, and author of the 2006 tome "The Greater Generation: In Defense of the Baby Boom Legacy," is perhaps the nation's biggest boomer booster.

Teens on TikTok may resent Americans born between 1946 and 1964 for failing to act on climate change and leaving behind economic inequality -- Steinhorn acknowledges this "unfinished business" -- but he still believes that his age cohort is unfairly maligned. "Boomers have been the villains ever since the 1980s," the 63-year-old Steinhorn told me when I called him for an interview, "in large part because boomers changed an America their elders didn't want to see changed."

Starting in the 1960s, he explains, the generation ushered in a cultural revolution that brought about historic strides in racial justice, feminism and gay rights. Boomers "turbocharged the environmental movement" with the first Earth Day in 1970 and replaced the conservative "culture of conformity" -- which had prevailed in the 1950s -- with the liberal "live and let live" norms of "baby boomer individualism," norms that have persisted and proliferated to the present.

Steinhorn welcomes criticism from younger generations -- "We can take it," he says gamely -- but argues that "millennials and Gen Z are living those social norms boomers made possible."

"The Greater Generation" was a conscious retort to decades of boomer bashing. "Hating boomers," Steinhorn recalls, "had become the last acceptable prejudice. When I was writing that book, everyone was blaming boomers for every ill that was going on in society." NBC News anchor Tom Brokaw, who famously lionized "the Greatest Generation" that fought World War II, had written in Newsweek that boomers "seem to have forgotten the example of their parents" who "made extraordinary sacrifices and never whined or whimpered."

First deemed too selfish to have kids, then too involved in their kids' lives, overly relativistic in their morals, then moralizing in their political correctness, "boomers have been a piÃ±ata for cultural critics," Steinhorn says. He wanted to publish "a corrective" to these narratives.

"The Greatest Generation deserves every bit of credit for protecting democracy when it was threatened; but Baby Boomers deserve even more credit for enriching democracy and fulfilling its promise," he wrote in the book. "Two generations stared at the same shortcomings, inequities, and hypocrisies of American life, but it was the Baby Boom generation that chose to tackle them, to hold this country to its grand ideals, to agitate for justice when it would have been easier to remain docile and silent."

As a millennial raised by a pair of liberal boomers, I'm instinctively sympathetic to Steinhorn's case. I'm close to my parents, and I share their values, so it made sense when Steinhorn told me there's much less of a cultural "generation gap" between boomers and younger cohorts than between boomers and their parents. "Whereas boomers and the prior generation had a difference in kind," he said, "what you have now is a difference in degree."

But then I think about my generation's frustration. Gallup polling shows that millennials and Gen Z are significantly more concerned about global warming than boomers. And exit polls showed that most boomers ended up voting for Donald Trump in 2016. (In December, The Washington Post published a striking photo of a 65-year-old New York diner owner's shrine to the president, complete with framed posters for the Beatles and the Who.) Indeed, as Steinhorn notes, "Trump represented something very, very 1960s and very, very baby boomer, which is to stick a thumb in the eye of the establishment."

Yet Steinhorn doesn't think this negates boomers' overall progressive legacy. Liberal boomer Hillary Clinton, he reminded me, won the popular vote. And the popular vote winner in 2000? A boomer named Al Gore, whose prescience on climate change earned him the nickname "the Goracle." At least some of the boomers are, well, OK.

Steinhorn thinks "OK boomer" identifies the wrong villains in the matter of the warming planet and worsening economic prospects. "It's not generational -- it's political," he told me.

"There's a political party in this country that prefers to put the interests of corporations over the interests of the environment." The problem is caving to Wall Street, not bowing to boomers.

He isn't cranky about "OK boomer," though; he was as amused as anyone when his 23-year-old daughter sent him the October New York Times article announcing the meme. He knew his friend was bringing the T-shirts on Thanksgiving -- including some for his children, who might wear them on an upcoming family vacation. If anything, all the eye-rolling at older generations conjures fond memories of the Mad magazines boomers read growing up -- classic satires that spoofed their parents.

It's not the only cross-generational similarity he sees, either. The Times observed that "OK boomer" is a retort to "basically any person over 30 who says something condescending about young people" -- and, as Steinhorn points out, that's a lot like the ‘60s youth mantra "Don't trust anybody over 30."

Boomers, Steinhorn thinks, are capable of taking all this criticism in stride.

"My sense is that boomers are going to be far more embracing of the implied mockery," he says, "because ultimately we do want our kids to make a better life for themselves and complete the unfinished business of our generation." In other words, perhaps we aren't doomed to endless online generational warfare, and we can have peace in our timelines. As a couple of boomer icons told us many years ago, "War is over, if you want it."

Texto completo: The creator of one of the world's most famous mysteries is giving obsessive fans a new clue.
Kryptos, a sculpture in a courtyard at the headquarters of the Central Intelligence Agency in Langley, Virginia, holds an encrypted message that has not fully yielded to attempts to crack it. It's been nearly 30 years since its tall scroll of copper with thousands of punched-through letters was set in place.
Three of the four passages of the sculpture have been decrypted (the first, though unacknowledged at the time, was solved by a team from the National Security Agency). But after nearly three decades, one brief passage remains uncracked. And that has been a source of delight and consternation to thousands of people around the world.
The sculptor, Jim Sanborn, has been hounded for decades by code-breaking enthusiasts. And he has twice provided clues to move the community of would-be solvers along, once in 2010 and again in 2014.
Now he is offering another clue. The last one, he says.
It is a word: "NORTHEAST." (More on that later.)
Why do people care so much about a puzzle cut into a sheet of copper in a courtyard after so much time? It's not just that the piece itself has a kind of brooding, powerful beauty, or the fact that it has been referred to in novels by thriller writer Dan Brown. It is something deeper, something that involves the nature of the human mind, said Craig Bauer, a professor of mathematics at York College of Pennsylvania and a former scholar in residence at the NSA's Center for Cryptologic History.
"We have many problems that are difficult to resolve -- intimidating, perhaps even scary," he said. "It gives people great pleasure to pick up on one that they think they have a chance of solving."
Deciphered
The message of Kryptos, and a partial guide to its solution, is contained in the panels of the sculpture. Sanborn devised the codes that he used for the passages with the help of Edward Scheidt, a retired chairman of the CIA's cryptographic center. The passages follow a theme of concealment and discovery, each more difficult to decipher than the last. The first reads:
BETWEEN SUBTLE SHADING AND THE ABSENCE OF LIGHT LIES THE NUANCE OF IQLUSION.(The misspelling was intentional, Sanborn has said, to make it more difficult to decode -- or, as he put it, "to mix it up.")
The second includes the location of CIA headquarters by latitude and longitude, and asks:
DOES LANGLEY KNOW ABOUT THIS? THEY SHOULD: IT'S BURIED OUT THERE SOMEWHERE. X WHO KNOWS THE EXACT LOCATION? ONLY WW.
The "W.W." is a reference to William Webster, who headed the CIA when the sculpture was unveiled. Sanborn provided him with a key for deciphering the messages.
Webster, who left the CIA in 1991, declined a request for an interview.
The third passage paraphrases, again with a bit of misspelling, the account by Egyptologist Howard Carter of opening King Tut's tomb.
With spacing and punctuation added, the text reads:
SLOWLY, DESPARATLY SLOWLY, THE REMAINS OF PASSAGE DEBRIS THAT ENCUMBERED THE LOWER PART OF THE DOORWAY WAS REMOVED. WITH TREMBLING HANDS I MADE A TINY BREACH IN THE UPPER LEFT-HAND CORNER. AND THEN, WIDENING THE HOLE A LITTLE, I INSERTED THE CANDLE AND PEERED IN. THE HOT AIR ESCAPING FROM THE CHAMBER CAUSED THE FLAME TO FLICKER, BUT PRESENTLY DETAILS OF THE ROOM WITHIN EMERGED FROM THE MIST. X CAN YOU SEE ANYTHING? Q
The fourth section is shorter than the others; it's just 97 characters, a fact that "could, in itself, present a decryption challenge," Scheidt said in an exchange of emails. Common solution methods rely on the frequency of the most common letters, like E, T, A, O, I and N. In addition, he said, the last passage uses what is known as a masking technique, a further level of obfuscation.
The clues Sanborn has offered so far are in the form of a "crib," which is a word or phrase that appears in the decrypted text. The 2010 clue was the word BERLIN, in the 64th through 69th positions of that final passage. In 2014 he revealed the word CLOCK in the next five, 70 through 74.
While the response was a frenzy of activity among enthusiasts, the result, in cryptographic terms, was bupkis.
So now, Sanborn, at 74, is giving the world another shot: the word NORTHEAST, at positions 26 through 34. Will it be enough?
Did we mention Sanborn is 74?
Holding onto one of the world's most enticing secrets can be stressful. Some would-be code-breakers have appeared at his home.
Many felt they had solved the puzzle, and wanted to check with Sanborn. Sometimes forcefully. Sometimes, in person.
Elonka Dunin, a game developer and consultant who has created a rich page of background information on the sculpture and oversees the best known online community of thousands of Kryptos fans, said that some who contact her (sometimes also at home) are obsessive and appear to have tipped into mental illness. "I am always gentle to them and do my best to listen to them," she said.
Sanborn has set up systems to allow people to check their proposed solutions without having to contact him directly. The most recent incarnation is an email-based process with a fee of $50 to submit a potential solution. He receives regular inquiries, so far none of them successful.
The ongoing process is exhausting, he said, adding, "It's not something I thought I would be doing 30 years on."
But time is passing. And while he makes no claims to mathematical accomplishment, he can do basic arithmetic. "For the past few years I have been trying to figure out how to have this 'system' survive my death," Sanborn said, "and it has not been easy."
He has decided that if the code is not broken when he dies, the secret will be put up for auction. He might even do it in his lifetime. "I do realize that the value of Kryptos is unknown and that perhaps this concept will bear little fruit," he said.

Texto completo: Robert Max can still see the ring of Nazi rifles pointed at him and his fellow soldiers hiding in the cellar of a small shack in France. The moans of wounded men had brought the Nazis, who wore white cloaks to blend into the snowy fields during the Battle of the Bulge.
With Allied artillery shells exploding nearby, sending white-hot shrapnel all around, Max stood out in the open with a rifle aimed at his chest. His captor told him he admired the valor Max had shown earlier that day, attempting to fight more than 100 soldiers with only six men and a machine gun.
"For you, the war is over," the German soldier told him, and Max immediately thought he would be shot.
But the Nazi soldier instead told him he would be sent to a prisoner of war camp. Max had his winter clothing taken from him and was told to march.
What the 96-year-old Max knows now is that he wasn't being taken to a POW camp. Instead, the Jewish soldier would be forced into slave labor for the Nazis, fixing the rail lines damaged by the Allies, but taking small pleasures in helping the men sabotage the work. He would spend 82 of the next 90 nights sleeping on ice and snow.
While speaking about his experiences from his bright home office in Summit recently, Max seemed to forget his surroundings and become absorbed in the past. He is one of the only living American POWs to have escaped Nazi slave labor — perhaps the only one — and a permanent exhibit about his life recently opened at the New Jersey Historical Society in Newark.
As a vacuum hummed in the background at his home, Max recalled reading about Adolf Hitler's plans for world conquest and the destruction of the Jewish people in the pages of The New York Times.
Max said he and the members of his Jewish fraternity at Ohio University decided to enlist. He was sent to Fort Dix for training and almost didn't get shipped out because of his musical abilities. Swing band leader Jack Leonard had the order set aside, but it didn't sit right with Max.
"My buddies were being shipped out and our nation was in dire circumstances," Max said. "My decision was made. I said, 'Jack, I can't sit out this war.' "
Max never forgot the words Leonard said to him: "Kid, if you leave now, you're not ever coming back."
Leonard was very nearly right.
At the labor camp, Max watched men around him succumb to malnutrition, the elements, disease and bullets.
"I could see nothing ahead but death," he said.
To keep his mind occupied, Max said. he thought about his mother's cooking so intensely he was able to see, taste and smell his favorite dishes. But food was not the only thing on his mind. It was in those nighttime hours he would begin to formulate an escape plan.
The escape As the Allied forces drew closer, 80 men at a time were shoved into small cattle cars. Max said they spent six days and nights in a space meant for 40.
"Some men were dying; some men were going out of their minds," he said.
After being pulled out of the boxcars, the men were forced to march again, and Max developed frostbite on his right foot. He wrapped the foot in his scarf, the only winter item he had left. Struggling to walk, between the injury and the effects of malnutrition, Max knew the time was now or never. If he didn't escape, Leonard's prediction would become true.
Max's plan was this. When the two lines of men came to a curve in the road, briefly out of sight of guards, he would throw himself over a hedgerow.
Max said he and two other American soldiers marching next to him escaped to the hedgerow. The other marching men closed ranks to hide the soldiers' absence.
"If the guards saw the space, they would come back, ultimately find us and shoot us," Max said.
The three men eventually happened upon an occupied village called Reichenbach. In the distance, Max spotted a white house and told the other two it was a safe place. Not believing him, they asked how he knew. He just did, he said. He felt it.
Crawling through alleys to avoid being caught by German soldiers, they eventually reached the house and knocked on the door. It was answered by an elderly gentleman who smiled when he saw the trio, something Max said he didn't understand then.
But now, 75 years later, Max also smiles as he recalls learning that the man had seen the gold U.S. pins on Max's clothing, and they had reminded him of a trip to Pittsburgh with his wife.
Max closes his eyes, remembering the soup the man's wife gave him, calling it the most delectable thing he had ever eaten.
The American men were allowed to hide in a hayloft before the Nazis were driven out of the area by American troops. Spotting the troops, the men stumbled out of their hiding spot and were finally rescued. Max's older brother, a company clerk, got word that Max was alive and told his parents in West Orange.
Back home Max returned to the U.S. after 10 months in a hospital and didn't talk much about his experiences until his wife arranged for Elie Wiesel to speak at their alma mater, Ohio University. When he heard Wiesel's reasons for writing his book "Night," and at the encouragement of his wife, he knew he had to tell his story of survival.
He wrote and published "The Long March Home" in 2017to serve as source for people to learn about the Holocaust and World War II. He was recently approached by Backpacks for Life, a Verona-based nonprofit, to film a documentary about his life story. It is expected to come out in February.
It will be shown at the New Jersey Historical Society. "We are looking forward to sharing this documentary with the community," said Alexa Modero, executive director of Backpacks for Life.
Max said he sounds like an old hack when he he longs for the "good ol' days" but he misses the leadership of presidents like Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry Truman. He lamented Donald Trump's criticisms of NATO and how the U.S. has started to pull away.
"One of the greatest early mistakes of President Donald Trump was to disconnect the U.S. from its NATO partners," Max said. "No one nation can stand alone. It soon became obvious, as he established connections with world dictators, which appeared to many of us as a role he saw for himself."
Max's wife, Shirley, died in 2015, but he has children and grandchildren, and thinks of their futures.
He believes the political and social climate has contributed to the rise of anti-Semitism. Jews "have always been a target for bigots or the disgruntled," he said.
"Too few of us remain from 'The Greatest Generation' following WWII, a time when we had inspiring leadership," Max said. "The American people rose up, supported the troops and one another."

Texto completo: Surely you remember the "basket of deplorables."
That was Hillary Clinton's 2016 characterization of some Donald Trump supporters. Observers saw it as a major gaffe, and conservatives erupted in hot, "How dare you!" indignation at the idea there was anything deplorable about voting for a lying, racist, misogynistic, vagina-grabbing, deadbeat.
Few people, if any, dared point out the obvious. Which is that Clinton was right.
Well, welcome to déjà vu all over again. Recently on CNN, Don Lemon presided over a segment about Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who recently blew up at an NPR reporter for having the temerity to ask him about Ukraine. The reporter says Pompeo challenged her to find that country on a map, which she did. Panelist Rick Wilson, a former GOP strategist, opined that Pompeo "knows deep within his heart that Donald Trump couldn't find Ukraine on a map if you had the letter U and a picture of an actual physical crane next to it."
At which Lemon started laughing and could not stop. He lowered his head to the desk as Wilson and a second panelist, New York Times columnist Wajahat Ali, adopted dumb rube accents in mockery of Trump supporters.
Wilson: "Donald Trump's the smart one - and y'all elitists are dumb!"
Ali: "'You elitists with your geography and your maps - and your spelling!'"
Trump World was predictably, if hypocritically, outraged. Lemon would later assert that he was laughing only at the initial joke and that he didn't hear - and disavows - the mockery. But the Poynter Institute, among other journalism professionals, was unpersuaded. It called Lemon's behavior "unprofessional," and added that, "Bending over and laughing until you cry while being oblivious to what your guests are doing was not a good look for Lemon. It was an even worse look for CNN."
You'll get no argument here. Lemon's attack of the tee-hee-hees reflected poorly on him, his employer and his profession.
But Lemon's response to it aside, Wilson and Ali's jokes - riffing as it does not just on Trump World's ignorance, but on its hostility to knowledge - strikes a chord. Consider an anecdote from the new book "A Very Stable Genius" by Philip Rucker and Carol Leonnig. It's about Trump's visit to a sacred American shrine, the USS Arizona Memorial at Pearl Harbor. He's on the boat, being ferried out to this iconic site, and he pulls then-Chief of Staff John Kelly aside. "Hey, John, what's this all about?" he asks. "What's this a tour of?"
Maybe if it were a one-off, you could ignore it. But from his disinterring of Frederick Douglass to the creative spellings of his tweets to his geographic gaffes ("We just got back from the Middle East," he once announced - in Israel) Trump produces daily, glaring and incontrovertible evidence of his intellectual dullness.
Which, in Trump World, will cost him absolutely nothing. Small wonder. A 2015 survey by the Pew Research Center found that among Americans with college and post-graduate degrees, progressives outpace conservatives by a wide margin.
In other words, the right is less well educated. In Trump, they've found someone who validates their inchoate biases and fears - and they don't much care that he doesn't know what happened at Pearl Harbor.
If you happen to be one of those crazy folks who thinks knowing stuff is good - especially on the world stage - that's frightening. And it lends a certain perspective to Lemon's lapses. Once again, a side issue takes center stage.
And the obvious goes unsaid.

Texto completo: DES MOINES, Iowa - For a full year, Democrats owned the Iowa spotlight as presidential candidates logged thousands of visits, spent tens of millions on TV and digital ads and boasted of rallies that drew, on some of their best days, 1,000 ardent supporters hoping to defeat President Donald Trump.
Then on Thursday, Trump dropped in for 2 1/2 hours and attracted more than 7,000 fans at a rally where he predicted that Iowa would deliver for him again in November - and warned what would happen if it did not.
"We're going to win the great state of Iowa, and it's going to be a historic landslide," Trump declared. "And if we don't win, your farms are going to hell."
For the last three presidential elections, Iowa has been a barometer of the nation's vacillating political sentiments. Twice it broke overwhelmingly for Barack Obama, who beat John McCain by nine points here in 2008. It swung back to give Trump a nine-point victory over Hillary Clinton in 2016.
And as the 2020 campaign formally begins on Monday with the state's caucuses, Republicans and Democrats are again looking to Iowa for answers.
Is Iowa - with its large rural, blue-collar and overwhelmingly white population - the kind of state where the Republican Party that Trump remade is going to dominate as long as he is on the ticket?
Or does it offer a glimmer of hope for Democrats to regain voters they lost in 2016?
As Mike Halepis waited to enter the rally at a Des Moines college campus the other night, he predicted the same "landslide" as Trump.
"Look around you. You see anybody else getting this kind of crowd?" Halepis, a restaurant employee, said. "The numbers, the economy, everything's headed in the right direction for the president, and we want to make sure we are, too."
But the indicators have not all been positive for Trump. Democrats roared back to life in the 2018 midterm elections, picking off two of the state's four congressional seats from Republicans. The anti-Trump sentiment was most evident around cities like Des Moines and along the Mississippi River, which is home to the nation's largest cluster of counties that voted twice for Obama and then for Trump. Those pivot counties have suffered from Trump's trade war with China.
Democrats said they were making inroads with Republicans and independents.
"We are up for grabs," said Sean Bagniewski, chairman of the Democratic Party of Polk County, which includes Des Moines.
He pointed to four Statehouse seats that Democrats flipped in Iowa in 2018. In Polk County, 871 people newly registered as Democrats in January, which the party says included 273 former Republicans.
But Jon Seaton, a Republican strategist with long experience in Iowa, said the party's loss of suburban women - a national phenomenon - was more than offset by white blue-collar voters who have broken a historic allegiance to Democrats to vote for Trump.
"I think the numbers that they are able to move are just not going to be nearly sufficient to overcome what is happening on the Republican side," he said.
And Republicans can point to winning the governor's race, along with picking up three seats in the state Senate in 2018.
Before swooping into Des Moines, Trump tweeted a New York Times/Siena College poll showing him winning head-to-head matchups with four leading Democratic presidential candidates in Iowa.
But what the president called "a great poll" also showed him ahead of Pete Buttigieg, the former Indiana mayor, by just one point and besting former Vice President Joe Biden by two points. Those numbers show how his political standing has softened after three years in office.
As Democrats consider which parts of the country and what kinds of voters are most persuadable, they are divided over whether Iowa's swing voters are worth pursuing, compared to others who are more liberal-leaning, but didn't show up in 2016.
Jeff Link, a Democratic strategist here who has held focus groups of Obama-Trump voters, said his party was passing up a huge opportunity if it ignored the 150,000 Iowans who cast ballots for Obama and then supported Trump.
"They didn't want to vote for Trump," he said, but were resigned to him as a protest against Hillary Clinton and the Washington establishment.
There are some signs that the Republican Party's brand is in trouble in Iowa. Last year, the state's longest-serving Republican legislator left the party and became a Democrat. Andy McKean, a representative from an area in northeast Iowa that broke for Trump in 2016 after voting for Obama in 2012, explained his switch, saying, "If this is the new normal, I want no part of it."
But examples like these remain the exception because most Republicans understand that the voters who make up their bedrock support in elections have an affinity for Trump that is far greater than their attachment to the Republican Party.

Much ado about screen time Panicking about your kids and their phones? The new research says don't.

Texto completo: It has become common wisdom that too much time spent on smartphones and social media is responsible for a recent spike in anxiety, depression and other mental health problems, especially among teenagers.
But a growing number of academic researchers have produced studies that suggest the common wisdom is wrong.
The latest research, published last month by two psychology professors, combs through about 40 studies that have examined the link between social media use and both depression and anxiety among adolescents. That link, according to the professors, is small and inconsistent.
"There doesn't seem to be an evidence base that would explain the level of panic and consternation around these issues," said Candice L. Odgers, a professor at the University of California at Irvine and the lead author of the paper, which was published in the Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry.
The debate over the harm we - and especially our children - are doing to ourselves by staring into phones is generally predicated on the assumption that the machines we carry in our pockets pose a significant risk to our mental health.
Worries about smartphones have led Congress to pass legislation to examine the impact of heavy smartphone use and pushed investors to pressure big tech companies to change the way they approach young customers.
The World Health Organization said last year that infants under a year old should not be exposed to electronic screens and that children between the ages of 2 and 4 should not have more than an hour of "sedentary screen time" each day.
Even in Silicon Valley, technology executives have made a point of keeping the devices and the software they develop away from their own children.
But some researchers question whether those fears are justified. They are not arguing that intensive use of phones does not matter. Children who are on their phones too much can miss out on other valuable activities, such as exercise. And research has shown that excessive phone use can exacerbate the problems of certain vulnerable groups, such as children with mental health issues.
They are, however, challenging the widespread belief that screens are responsible for broad societal problems like the rising rates of anxiety and sleep deprivation among teenagers. In most cases, they say, the phone is just a mirror that reveals the problems a child would have even without the phone.
The researchers worry that the focus on keeping children away from screens is making it hard to have more productive conversations about topics like how to make phones more useful for low-income people, who tend to use them more, or how to protect the privacy of teenagers who share their lives online.
"Many of the people who are terrifying kids about screens, they have hit a vein of attention from society and they are going to ride that. But that is super bad for society," said Andrew Przybylski, director of research at the Oxford Internet Institute, who has published several studies on the topic.
The new article by Odgers and Michaeline R. Jensen, of the University of North Carolina at Greensboro, comes just a few weeks after the publication of an analysis by Amy Orben, a researcher at the University of Cambridge, and shortly before the planned publication of similar work from Jeff Hancock, the founder of the Stanford Social Media Lab. Both reached similar conclusions.
"The current dominant discourse around phones and well-being is a lot of hype and a lot of fear," Hancock said. "But if you compare the effects of your phone to eating properly or sleeping or smoking, it's not even close."
Hancock's analysis of about 226 studies on the well-being of phone users concluded that "when you look at all these different kinds of well-being, the net effect size is essentially zero."
The debate about screen time and mental health goes back to the early days of the iPhone. In 2011, the American Academy of Pediatrics published a widely cited paper that warned doctors about "Facebook depression."

Texto completo: DES MOINES, Iowa - For a full year, Democrats owned the Iowa spotlight as presidential candidates logged thousands of visits, spent tens of millions on TV and digital ads and boasted of rallies that drew, on some of their best days, 1,000 ardent supporters hoping to defeat President Donald Trump.
Then on Thursday, Trump dropped in for 2 1/2 hours and attracted more than 7,000 fans at a rally where he predicted that Iowa would deliver for him again in November - and warned what would happen if it did not.
"We're going to win the great state of Iowa, and it's going to be a historic landslide," Trump declared. "And if we don't win, your farms are going to hell."
For the last three presidential elections, Iowa has been a barometer of the nation's vacillating political sentiments. Twice it broke overwhelmingly for Barack Obama, who beat John McCain by nine points here in 2008. It swung back to give Trump a nine-point victory over Hillary Clinton in 2016.
And as the 2020 campaign formally begins on Monday with the state's caucuses, Republicans and Democrats are again looking to Iowa for answers.
Is Iowa - with its large rural, blue-collar and overwhelmingly white population - the kind of state where the Republican Party that Trump remade is going to dominate as long as he is on the ticket?
Or does it offer a glimmer of hope for Democrats to regain voters they lost in 2016?
As Mike Halepis waited to enter the rally at a Des Moines college campus the other night, he predicted the same "landslide" as Trump.
"Look around you. You see anybody else getting this kind of crowd?" Halepis, a restaurant employee, said. "The numbers, the economy, everything's headed in the right direction for the president, and we want to make sure we are, too."
But the indicators have not all been positive for Trump. Democrats roared back to life in the 2018 midterm elections, picking off two of the state's four congressional seats from Republicans. The anti-Trump sentiment was most evident around cities like Des Moines and along the Mississippi River, which is home to the nation's largest cluster of counties that voted twice for Obama and then for Trump. Those pivot counties have suffered from Trump's trade war with China.
Democrats said they were making inroads with Republicans and independents.
"We are up for grabs," said Sean Bagniewski, chairman of the Democratic Party of Polk County, which includes Des Moines.
He pointed to four Statehouse seats that Democrats flipped in Iowa in 2018. In Polk County, 871 people newly registered as Democrats in January, which the party says included 273 former Republicans.
But Jon Seaton, a Republican strategist with long experience in Iowa, said the party's loss of suburban women - a national phenomenon - was more than offset by white blue-collar voters who have broken a historic allegiance to Democrats to vote for Trump.
"I think the numbers that they are able to move are just not going to be nearly sufficient to overcome what is happening on the Republican side," he said.
And Republicans can point to winning the governor's race, along with picking up three seats in the state Senate in 2018.
Before swooping into Des Moines, Trump tweeted a New York Times/Siena College poll showing him winning head-to-head matchups with four leading Democratic presidential candidates in Iowa.
But what the president called "a great poll" also showed him ahead of Pete Buttigieg, the former Indiana mayor, by just one point and besting former Vice President Joe Biden by two points. Those numbers show how his political standing has softened after three years in office.
As Democrats consider which parts of the country and what kinds of voters are most persuadable, they are divided over whether Iowa's swing voters are worth pursuing, compared to others who are more liberal-leaning, but didn't show up in 2016.
Jeff Link, a Democratic strategist here who has held focus groups of Obama-Trump voters, said his party was passing up a huge opportunity if it ignored the 150,000 Iowans who cast ballots for Obama and then supported Trump.
"They didn't want to vote for Trump," he said, but were resigned to him as a protest against Hillary Clinton and the Washington establishment.
There are some signs that the Republican Party's brand is in trouble in Iowa. Last year, the state's longest-serving Republican legislator left the party and became a Democrat. Andy McKean, a representative from an area in northeast Iowa that broke for Trump in 2016 after voting for Obama in 2012, explained his switch, saying, "If this is the new normal, I want no part of it."
But examples like these remain the exception because most Republicans understand that the voters who make up their bedrock support in elections have an affinity for Trump that is far greater than their attachment to the Republican Party.

Texto completo: After a 50-year wait, the Kansas City Chiefs are Super Bowl champions once again, with Patrick Mahomes engineering a fourth-quarter comeback to beat the San Francisco 49ers, 31-20, at a raucous Hard Rock Stadium.
It was a game of momentum swings, but the last one went to the Chiefs, who entered the fourth quarter trailing by 10 points but proceeded to score three touchdowns over the course of just 5 minutes and 1 second of game clock, overwhelming a San Francisco defense that had simply been hoping to hold on to a lead.

Texto completo: The most consequential decision a member of Congress can make is whether to send troops into harm's way, and it is one we take seriously and personally.
We both served in the greater Middle East and saw the impact of these intractable conflicts on our fellow service members and their families. Our military personnel are our nation's most valuable asset; we must not send them into unnecessary war.
We voted against the War Powers Resolution that the House passed Jan. 9 because it merely restated existing law. It addressed a de-escalated conflict with a symbolic vote that did more to distract than to fix the real challenges we face. If Congress wants to assert its power to declare war, we must take on the hard task of publicly debating a new Authorization for Use of Military Force, the AUMF, as it's commonly called, as well as congressional appropriations for military operations. That is where decisions of war and peace are made.
Qassim Soleimani was a terrorist responsible for the death of hundreds of Americans. Our fellow service members were killed and wounded at his direction, and all intelligence indicates that he was in the process of planning further attacks. President Donald Trump was within his right to order this attack and is now correctly de-escalating the conflict with the clear mandate that we must prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear capability.
We are not at war with Iran, and no president can engage in war without congressional approval. But the commander in chief holds the authority and responsibility to target hostile combatants who threaten American forces and civilians. The War Powers Resolution passed by the House in January sends the wrong message to the American people and the world that our nation is heading toward or is currently engaged in war with Iran. Neither is true.
While we respect our colleagues who serve our nation and supported this resolution, the debate Congress should have is not whether the president had the authority to carry out the Soleimani killing, but rather how we move forward as a governing body if we must commit forces in future sustained combat operations to protect our nation.
It is Congress's responsibility to act as a check on presidential power - and that includes on matters relating to war. This past week underscored that the United States is operating under outdated laws governing the use of force. We must replace the nearly two-decade-old AUMFs with a legal framework that empowers the president to act against threats to our nation while constraining him from unilaterally placing us on a path to war. We must also use the power of the purse in stating our military objectives.
Our constituents sent us to Congress to do what is right, even when it is difficult. This transcends partisan politics. It's about changing the way we engage in war and peace for decades to come. Now it is up to Congress to debate an AUMF that reflects the threats of today and tomorrow, not the forever wars of yesterday.

"Look around you. You see anybody else getting this kind of crowd?" Halepis, a restaurant employee, said. "The numbers, the economy, everything's headed in the right direction for the president, and we want to make sure we are, too."
But the indicators have not all been positive for Trump. Democrats roared back to life in the 2018 midterm elections, picking off two of the state's four congressional seats from Republicans. The anti-Trump sentiment was most evident around cities like Des Moines and along the Mississippi River, which is home to the nation's largest cluster of counties that voted twice for Obama and then for Trump. Those pivot counties have suffered from Trump's trade war with China.
Democrats said they were making inroads with Republicans and independents.
"We are up for grabs," said Sean Bagniewski, chairman of the Democratic Party of Polk County, which includes Des Moines.
He pointed to four Statehouse seats that Democrats flipped in Iowa in 2018. In Polk County, 871 people newly registered as Democrats in January, which the party says included 273 former Republicans.
But Jon Seaton, a Republican strategist with long experience in Iowa, said the party's loss of suburban women - a national phenomenon - was more than offset by white blue-collar voters who have broken a historic allegiance to Democrats to vote for Trump.
"I think the numbers that they are able to move are just not going to be nearly sufficient to overcome what is happening on the Republican side," he said.
And Republicans can point to winning the governor's race, along with picking up three seats in the state Senate in 2018.
Before swooping into Des Moines, Trump tweeted a New York Times/Siena College poll showing him winning head-to-head matchups with four leading Democratic presidential candidates in Iowa.
But what the president called "a great poll" also showed him ahead of Pete Buttigieg, the former Indiana mayor, by just one point and besting former Vice President Joe Biden by two points. Those numbers show how his political standing has softened after three years in office.
As Democrats consider which parts of the country and what kinds of voters are most persuadable, they are divided over whether Iowa's swing voters are worth pursuing, compared to others who are more liberal-leaning, but didn't show up in 2016.
Jeff Link, a Democratic strategist here who has held focus groups of Obama-Trump voters, said his party was passing up a huge opportunity if it ignored the 150,000 Iowans who cast ballots for Obama and then supported Trump.
"They didn't want to vote for Trump," he said, but were resigned to him as a protest against Hillary Clinton and the Washington establishment.
There are some signs that the Republican Party's brand is in trouble in Iowa. Last year, the state's longest-serving Republican legislator left the party and became a Democrat. Andy McKean, a representative from an area in northeast Iowa that broke for Trump in 2016 after voting for Obama in 2012, explained his switch, saying, "If this is the new normal, I want no part of it."
But examples like these remain the exception because most Republicans understand that the voters who make up their bedrock support in elections have an affinity for Trump that is far greater than their attachment to the Republican Party.

It was a game of momentum swings, but the last one went to the Chiefs, who entered the fourth quarter trailing by 10 points but proceeded to score three touchdowns over the course of just 5 minutes and 1 second of game clock, overwhelming a San Francisco defense that had simply been hoping to hold on to a lead.

Democrats should fix Trump's mess, not blow things up for the nation

Texto completo: For over a year, we've perused the robust field of Democratic presidential candidates, squeezing them like melons in the produce aisle. We've wondered whether some are too old or too young. We've speculated about whether the nation is ready for a female president or, perhaps, a gay one. We've analyzed who would fare best in a debate against Typhoon Trump.
None of this will really matter until Democrats resolve the overarching issue dividing the party. With the Iowa caucuses kicking off the primary season Monday, Democrats must settle on a winning approach to governing.
The issue was drawn into sharp focus recently when the editorial board at The New York Times, despite "more than a dozen hours" questioning the leading Democrats, became paralyzed — not over candidates but over the direction the party should take. The paper broke with its 160-year tradition and gave dual endorsements. to Sens Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota.
What stumped the Times was what it identified as a choice as between "the radical and the realist models." You might think of these positions as "ultra-progressive and center-left," and you might view them as "lanes" rather than "models." Semantics aside, the two wings of the party — which have always been part of modern Democratic posturing — are in a fierce struggle.
Do Democrats want to fix the mess created in President Donald Trump's first term, or blow it up? That's what this primary is really about.
Polling leaders among fixers are former Vice President Joe Biden, former South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Klobuchar, who just Wednesday broke into double digits in Iowa. The duo most in favor of blowing things up are Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren.
The time for picking a lane is at hand. Much as I admire the ultra-progressive agenda, I favor staying closer to the center in this election.
As I see it, the far left represents 90% of what I favor, has a 50% chance of beating Trump and, if elected, can get 40% of what I support through Congress. The center-left represents only 75% of what I favor but has a 60% chance of beating Trump, and it, too has the very same 40% chance in Congress. Bottom line: We wind up in the same place legislatively, but the centrist Democrats have a better chance of winning in November.
In presidential elections, candidates in both parties tend to sketch out somewhat extreme positions during the primaries, and then, out of necessity, move closer to the center for the general election. The problem facing the Warren/Sanders wing this year is that rigidity is part of the appeal — and that approach is reflected among many supporters.
That makes it harder and more time-consuming to temper positions that could be damaging in the general election. And the longer the party takes to establish its governing strategy, the greater the risk that Democrats will not rally enthusiastically around the eventual nominee.
It's said that government is so broken that blowing things up is the only option. But if victory in November requires appealing to moderates, some of whom might have voted Republican in 2016, then the sledgehammer approach could be too much.
Klobuchar and Buttigieg are making the most compelling cases for a center-left approach. Warren, who has an early polling advantage against both of them, who has already softened her approach to dismantling the health care system, could be the Democrats' top choice if she continues to moderate her positions. She must assure primary voters that her long-term goals do not warrant short-term fears.
The Democrats' best bet will be the candidate who favors progressive policies while acknowledging that in this election the HOV (High Occupancy Voter) lane runs down the center, not the far left.

Texto completo: "When someone is locked up, possibly for life, for a crime they had nothing to do with, it's a thing you get inside you and that you feel is intolerable."
Lesley Risinger, co-founder and director of the Last Resort Exoneration Project at Seton Hall Law School in Newark
For nearly a decade, Lesley and D. Michael Risinger pored over transcripts, interviewed witnesses, consulted firearms experts and argued in courtrooms, with help of a team of Seton Hall law students.
Their goal: Free two men they believed were wrongly convicted for a double murder in Camden a quarter-century ago.
That chance at freedom came Dec. 26, when a New Jersey appeals court overturned the convictions and ordered a new trial for Kevin Baker and Shawn Washington, who were found guilty of the killings and locked away in state prison in 1996.
For the husband-and-wife legal team who run the Last Resort Exoneration Project at Seton Hall Law School in Newark, it was a hard-fought first victory after years of work to make the justice system face up to its own flaws.
"There's nothing worse than being locked up for something you didn't do, especially if it's a long sentence," said Lesley Risinger, who co-founded the program in 2011 and serves as director. "When someone is locked up, possibly for life, for a crime they had nothing to do with, it's a thing you get inside you and that you feel is intolerable."
The Exoneration Project is driven by a key premise — that the criminal justice system makes mistakes and may send people to prison for crimes they did not commit. An estimated 1% to 5% of those in prison have been wrongfully convicted, according to a report last year ordered by New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir Grewal.
Assuming a 1% rate of wrongful conviction in New Jersey, nearly 200 of those currently in a state prison population of about 19,500 people are innocent. Yet there have been only 37 overturned convictions in the state since 1989, the report said.
'Total failure of the defense' Lesley Risinger first got involved in cases of the wrongfully accused nearly 30 years ago, when she helped her mother, an attorney, appeal the conviction of Luis Kevin Rojas of Weehawken. Rojas, 18 at the time of the alleged crime, had been found guilty of a fatal shooting in 1990, but the case was marred by mistaken identity and missing eyewitness testimony, his attorneys successfully argued. He was freed after a retrial in 1998.
Risinger later represented Fernando Bermudez, who was convicted in a 1991 Manhattan murder, but the case was based on perjured testimony, Risinger argued. In 2009, a judge freed Bermudez after 18 years in prison.
In 2011, the Risingers launched the Last Resort Exoneration Project and got many letters from prisoners claiming innocence and looking for help. With help from law students, they vet cases for evidence that could prove a conviction was improper.
The application from Kevin Baker, one of the two convicts in the Camden case, was compelling.
"It cried out for attention simply based on the weakness of the evidence and the total failure of the defense to present a defense," said Lesley Risinger, 62, a former adjunct professor who graduated from the law school in 2003.
The case rested on testimony from a single witness who was high on crack at the time of the shooting and whose story was so shaky that defense lawyers thought it wouldn't be believed, Risinger said. The state called six witnesses during the two-day trial, while the defense called none, court records show.
The proceedings ended in a guilty verdict and life sentences with no chance of parole for 60 years. John Wynne, an assistant Camden County prosecutor on the case, told The New York Times in 1996 that even he was surprised by the verdict.
"We had to do the investigation that should have been done then," said D. Michael Risinger, 72, the associate director of the Exoneration Project.
Last month, a state appeals court finally agreed, ordering a new trial. The court ruled that additional evidence not presented at the time "probably would have changed the jury's verdict." Jurors never heard a recording of Baker's 911 call or a forensics analysis showing that the shooting could not have happened as the witness described, the court found.
Baker and Washington, who is represented by Lawrence Lustberg, an attorney with Gibbons P.C. in Newark, remain in state prison in Trenton waiting to find out whether the Camden County prosecutor will seek a new trial.
The Risingers hope a conviction review unit created by the New Jersey Attorney General's Office last year will end the case and the Prosecutor's Office will determine that pursuing it "would be fruitless and unjust."
In a statement, Grewal said his office and Camden prosecutors are "committed to pursuing the just result in each and every case.
"We are actively reviewing this case, including the trial evidence and the extensive appellate and post-conviction proceedings that have taken place over the past 25 years," Grewal said.
A passion for the work The Last Resort Exoneration Project is similar to "innocence projects" that rely on DNA to prove that individuals did not commit crimes of which they were accused.
But the Risingers have taken an even more difficult route, choosing cases that lack DNA evidence but where other facts show the defendants did not receive a fair trial. They said they closely review applications to see where there's a strong legal case to prove innocence.
The Baker case is the Exoneration Project's first overturned conviction and required extensive litigation, expert analysis and hundreds of legal exhibits. The Risingers said they have also given close consideration to at least a dozen more cases.
About half a dozen law school students volunteer with the program each year. Over nine years, about a dozen worked on the Camden case, studying case files, reviewing trial documents and giving feedback on oral arguments.
They include Renee Mariotti, a part-time law student from New York City who chose Seton Hall Law in part for the chance to work at the Exoneration Project. Her interest came after listening to podcasts about wrongful convictions, in particular the Baltimore murder case of Adnan Syed made famous in the podcast "Serial."
"These are men who have been imprisoned for, coming up on 25 years, crimes they did not commit," Mariotti said of Baker and Washington. "It's nice to see the law working in what feels like the right way in this case. That's not always the outcome."
Amy Cuzzolino, a Bloomfield native who graduated in 2016, helped review applications to find viable legal cases. Her work gave her more insight into how the justice system works — and fails, she said.
"I didn't come away with a sense that the system is bad because of bad actors in it. It's more a question of inefficiency and limited resources. There are a lot of people who want to do the right thing but don't know how," said Cuzzolino, who is studying for an advanced degree in international law.
The Risingers, who live in Kearny, don't take a salary for their work. Private donations to the program pay for expenses like buying transcripts and consulting experts.
Michael Risinger, who worked on civil rights cases involving wrongful police shootings in the '70s and '80s, said he has devoted his career to making sure the legal system is accurate, especially in criminal cases. The former Seton Hall law professor served on the New Jersey Supreme Court's Committee on Evidence for 25 years.
He and his wife, who married in 2004 and have six children from previous marriages, see their work with the Exoneration Project as a calling, he said.
"We have sufficient money. We live very frugally, and we don't have ambitions to take grand tours or anything," he said. "We'd rather do this."

Texto completo: Democratic presidential campaigns are trying an old strategy to gather new supporters. But no one is admitting it's actually working.
Candidates and officials from Democratic presidential campaigns have told reporters in Iowa that rivals' campaign officials have reached out about forming a caucus night alliance, in where supporters of one candidate would switch to another if their first choice didn't get enough votes to move on to second round voting.
Andrew Yang said in a Bloomberg News roundtable that he had been contacted by other candidates about making a caucus night alliance, but that he did not plan to make a deal.
U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar has not confirmed whether other campaigns have approached her, as The New York Times reported Tuesday, but she told Radio Iowa that the idea does not interest her.
Making caucus night alliances is common practice for presidential campaigns, according to former U.S. Rep. Dave Nagle, a longtime Iowa Democrat. In fact, he said front-runners should try to make alliances and recommended former Vice President Joe Biden, U.S. Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren's campaigns do it.
"Biden and Sanders, too, and Warren, should all be reaching out to the ones that we know going in will probably not be viable," Nagle said. "And that would be (Tom) Steyer and Yang."
If supporters of Yang, Klobuchar and Steyer, who have not polled above the 15% in the Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom Iowa Poll all year, moved en masse to another candidate in second-round voting, it could push that new candidate into serious contention.
An alliance between two weaker candidates could help them both on caucus night. If two candidates with 8 or 9% support each combined forces, one of them could become viable in a precinct. Done strategically, both candidates could pick up delegates across the state.
How would it work? Candidates must attract at least 15% of the crowd at a caucus site to be declared viable. If, after the first alignment, a candidate is not viable, their supporters must pull more people into the group or re-align with a second choice candidate.
But if the nonviable candidate's crowd moved to back another campaign, that process changes a bit. A campaign representative for the nonviable candidate would encourage supporters to choose the ally, rather than scatter among other viable groups.
Former U.S. Sen. John Edwards and U.S. Rep. Dennis Kucinich tried the strategy in 2004. The Democratic candidates announced in January that, if one of them were not viable in a precinct, their supporters should caucus for the other.
Edwards came in second place on caucus night. Kucinich came in fifth, with just 1% support in the state.
But by announcing the alliance publicly, rivals seized on the strategy as a sign of weakness. A spokeswoman for former Gov. Howard Dean's campaign told CNN in 2004, "We are planning on being viable in all the precincts. We have no strategy to coordinate with another campaign."
Today, rather than a candidate announcing such a strategy, precinct captains from the campaigns would direct voters on caucus night to go toward a certain second choice.
"That's why the candidates need as many precinct captains in as many of the precincts as they can, who can speak and address (supporters) and do that manipulation," Nagle said. "That comes back to organization."
Even a perfectly planned caucus alliance faces a major challenge: The will of the people.
Paul MacGregor is going into Caucus Day with a short list. The 71-year-old retired physician is trying to choose between former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Klobuchar and Steyer.
MacGregor said if his first choice for president isn't viable in the first alignment, he would be open to hearing suggestions from staffers of his initial preferred candidate — but only to a point.
"Ultimately, I'm an adult. I make my own decision," the Mason City resident said. "I wouldn't blindly go against my second choice just because a campaign asked me to."
MacGregor doesn't think other Iowans will be persuaded on this strategy. He noted some Iowans have spent months vetting candidates, and they've put a lot of thought into second choices.
"I don't know how powerful that would be, that a campaign asked you to switch," he said.
Patrick Pope, a 46-year-old Biden supporter in Council Bluffs, said he might be persuaded to go along with another campaign, but he wouldn't caucus for just anybody.
"I think it would depend on who they were telling me to go to," the education administrator said. "I have some problems with Buttigieg, so I don't know if I would go over to Mayor Pete's room, if that's what they were directing me to do. But I would have no problems with Warren or Bernie."
In 2004, former U.S. Sen. John Edwards, at the podium, and U.S. Rep. Dennis Kucinich, not pictured, announced in January that, if one of them were not viable in a precinct, their supporters should caucus for the other. Edwards came in second place on caucus night. Kucinich came in fifth, with just 1% support in Iowa.

Texto completo: ALBANY - A state senator is calling on New York to ban the use of facial recognition technology by police agencies, following reports that its use is much more widespread than previously known.
State Sen. Brad Hoylman (D-Manhattan) said recent news reports reveal companies have been "scraping" Facebook, YouTube and other online and public sources to compile a database of images most people aren't aware of.
The companies, notably the controversial Clearview AI - which claims to have processed 3 billion images - then pitch the information to police agencies around the nation. The Suffolk County Police Department is one of its customers.
"Facial recognition technology threatens to end every New Yorker's ability to walk down the street anonymously," Holyman said. "In the wrong hands, this technology presents a chilling threat to our privacy and civil liberties - especially when evidence shows this technology is less accurate when used on people of color, and transgender, nonbinary and nonconforming people. New York must take action to regulate this increasingly pervasive and dangerously powerful technology, before it's too late."
stintel200202_anowidget
An attorney for Clearview AI called the proposed bill too broad and said the company's software has helped police solve crimes, and the move to ban the technology amounts to a "rush to condemn these harms that haven't happened." 
Hoylman's legislation echoes other proposals in Albany aiming to reign in surveillance and strengthen privacy protections.
A bill by Assemb. Monica Wallace (D-Lancaster) would ban schools from using facial recognition technology. Other proposals include prohibiting its use in apartment buildings as a way to replace keys.
Another bill, from State Sen. Kevin Thomas (D-Levittown), would force all companies that collect personal data to first obtain "express and documented consent" from consumers before using, selling or sharing their data.
At issue with Hoylman's bill is the reported growing use of facial recognition technology by police. A number of municipalities have banned its use and other states are considering prohibitions as well.
Defense attorneys and civil liberties groups warn about the "Big Brother" surveillance aspect, while contending the technology can be inaccurate and misused for nonpolicing purposes.
"Biometric recognition systems like face surveillance are unethical and wildly inaccurate, and they have no place in the hands of law enforcement," Michael Sisitzky, an attorney with the New York Civil Liberties Union, said in a statement. "There's overwhelming research showing facial recognition's inability to accurately identify women, young people and people of color. And when these tools are used by law enforcement, the consequences can be devastating."
Clearview AI has said it supplies the technology to more than 600 law-enforcement agencies around the country, including Chicago. The New York Police Department reportedly used Clearview on a trial basis, then declined to sign up - although a New York Post report said some individual police officers are still using it.
Nassau County police aren't using Clearview AI, a department spokesman said. Their Suffolk counterparts are.
"The Suffolk County Police Department is using the services of Clearview AI on a trial basis as part of a pilot program," Police Commissioner Geraldine Hart said in a statement. "The department has implemented strict guidelines for the usage of facial recognition during investigative searches to ensure best practices are followed."
Clearview's database of images far exceeds any compiled by any U.S. government agency, The New York Times reported.
Hoylman announced his proposal days after the Times and Post reports.
A NYPD spokeswoman said the agency has no "institutional relationship" with Clearview, despite the company's claims that it recently assisted in an arrest involving a bomb scare.
NYPD Police Commissioner Dermot Shea said the technology is an important tool for solving crimes. He said officers will use video from around a crime scene and compare it to our "legally obtained arrest photo database."
"If we lost that, that would be a significant blow to how we fight crime in New York City," he said last week at the New York City Police Foundation's annual breakfast in Manhattan.
"People are worried that you are going to have cameras on the corner and scanning crowds that go by. That is not how we use facial recognition," Shea said.
In a post on its website, Clearview said it uses publicly available web pages, not private data. It said its computer application services are restricted to law-enforcement agencies and not available to the public.
"Nonetheless, we recognize that powerful tools always have the potential to be abused, regardless of who is using them, and we take the threat very seriously," the statement said.
"Moreover, Clearview's user code of conduct mandates that investigators use our technology in a safe and ethical manner, and for legitimate law enforcement and security purposes only," the company continued. "They are required to obtain permission from a supervisor at their organizations before creating their Clearview accounts, and may only use the app for purposes authorized by their supervisors."
Tor Ekeland, an attorney representing Clearview, said the company's software shouldn't be considered surveillance in comparison to Facebook, Google and other companies that track a person's location, buying preferences and other details. 
"Facial recognition technology is all over society. What Clearview is, is just the best version of it," Ekeland said. "It's certainly not surveillance software. It just identifies people in photos."
He said the company isn't opposed to regulation but Hoylman's bill is too broad.
"There's a debate to be had about facial recognition. It should be regulated in a reasonable manner," Ekeland said. But as far as banning it, he add

The Socialist Evolution of Bernie Sanders

Texto completo: Agree or disagree with Bernie Sanders, at least he's consistent -- or so he claims. "Having a long record," the Vermont senator said in October, "gives people the understanding that these ideas that I'm talking about -- they are in my guts. They are in my heart. This is who I am as a human being, and it ain't gonna change."
That's true up to a point. During half a century in public life, Mr. Sanders has dependably denounced "oligarchy" and proclaimed himself a "democratic socialist." But his definition of the term has radically changed. Last year he said his goal was "an economy in which you have wealth being created by the private sector, but you have a fair distribution of that wealth." He added: "I think that countries like Denmark and Sweden do very well."
He had a different vision in the 1970s, when he sought statewide office four times as the nominee of the Liberty Union Party of Vermont. Campaigning for U.S. Senate in 1971, he demanded the nationalization of utilities. In 1973 he proposed a federal takeover of "the entire energy industry," and in 1974 he wanted a 100% tax on all income above $1 million. In 1976 he asserted that workers needed to "take immediate control of the economy if we are to survive" and called for "public ownership of utilities, banks and major industries." He had a plan for "public control over capital." As late as 1987 he asserted that "democracy means public ownership of the major means of production."
By the time Mr. Sanders won his first election -- as mayor of Burlington, Vt., in 1981 -- he had become an independent. He had also begun a dalliance with the Socialist Workers Party, a communist group that had followed Leon Trotsky. Mr. Sanders endorsed the SWP's presidential nominee in 1980 and 1984, spoke at SWP campaign rallies during that period, and in 1980 was part of its slate of would-be presidential electors.
The SWP promoted a foreign policy openly hostile to U.S. interests, and Mr. Sanders expressly endorsed some aspects of it. Last year the Washington Examiner quoted him from a 1980 press release: "I fully support the SWP's continued defense of the Cuban revolution." The party even backed Iran's new theocracy while it was holding U.S. Embassy personnel hostage. In a 1979 speech, presidential nominee Andrew Pulley said: "Who are these hostages anyway? Well, we can be sure that many of them are simply spies . . . or people assigned to protect the spies."
In 1985 Mayor Sanders visited Nicaragua. On returning, he called its Soviet-backed leader, Daniel Ortega, "impressive" and said it "makes sense" for the regime to suppress newspapers given the threat from the U.S.-supported Contra insurgency.
Mr. Sanders's 1997 memoir, "Outsider in the House," makes no mention of the SWP, and his governing style as mayor was not so radical. "Mr. Sanders did not campaign as a Socialist," the New York Times reported in 1981, quoting the mayor-elect: "I'm not going to war with the city's financial and business community." In "Why Bernie Sanders Matters" (2015), biographer Harry Jaffe writes that as a candidate "Sanders went out of his way to assure homeowners he would not raise their taxes." Perhaps because he knew Burlington's aldermen -- and the voters -- would balk at radical domestic measures, he projected his ideological ambitions abroad. If he did that as president, the consequences would be real.
He has tempered his enthusiasm for leftist Third World tyrants but remains cagey. Mr. Ortega left power in 1990 but returned in 2007. "He has since become a dictator, and I think that's unfortunate," Mr. Sanders said last month. Critics knew that in the '80s. Earlier he cast his previous support as simple antiwar activism: "I plead guilty to, throughout my adult life, doing everything that I can to prevent war and destruction." And in 2016 he said: "When I talk about democratic socialism, I'm not talking about Venezuela, I'm not talking about Cuba." That wasn't always the case.
After three decades in Congress, he has settled on a populist vision that fits in on the Democratic left. In a major speech last June elaborating his idea of socialism, he cast himself in the tradition of Franklin D. Roosevelt and urged listeners to "reclaim our democracy by having the courage to take on the powerful corporate interests whose greed is destroying the social and economic fabric of our country." He enumerated a series of positive rights -- to "quality health care," "as much education as one needs," "a good job that pays a living wage," "affordable housing," "a secure retirement" and "a clean environment." But he said nothing about state control over the means of production or Fidel Castro's revolution.
"The world has come around to see things like he does," longtime Sanders staffer Phil Fiermonte told Mr. Jaffe in 2015. Maybe, but Mr. Sanders has come around further, to judge by his own words. Given what he used to stand for, inconsistency wouldn't be his greatest fault.

Why the Democratic Majority Hasn't Emerged

Texto completo: The Democrats lost to Donald Trump and may do it again. How did the world's oldest political party, which has won four of the past seven presidential elections and received popular-vote pluralities in two more, find itself in this pickle?
One symptom of the party's ailment is that its four top-polling presidential candidates in national surveys are in their 70s and No. 5 is a 38-year-old former mayor of a city of 102,000. Why haven't others risen? Where are the candidates with demonstrated appeal to critical segments of the electorate? One answer is that over the past decade the Democrats have had a tough time electing candidates beyond heavily Democratic constituencies.
The decision to enact ObamaCare in 2010 despite its obvious unpopularity -- forced through by Speaker Nancy Pelosi over President Obama's doubts -- not only cost Democrats the House but helped prevent the election of Democratic senators and governors in marginal states and produced Republican legislative majorities that dominated redistricting after the 2010 census. It may be reasonable for a party to risk seats to achieve a major policy goal. But the 2010 losses were massive, and current Democratic complaints about health care suggest ObamaCare hasn't been a policy success.
The Democratic Party has always been a coalition of out-groups. For almost a century after the Civil War it was an awkward alliance of Southern segregationists and Catholic immigrants. Until the 1930s, it had a hard time finding plausible presidential candidates because most of its prominent officeholders were Southerners or Catholics, then considered unelectable nationally. But in 1932 they had a New York governor who was firmly Protestant and a fifth cousin of the popular Republican President Theodore Roosevelt.
Today, with its four top contenders from the heavily Democratic Northeast -- Delaware, Vermont, Massachusetts, New York -- it has a similar problem. Delaware and Vermont were competitive states when Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders first sought office in the 1970s. But neither man has faced a competitive statewide race in decades.
Representing a one-party constituency tends to breed habits of complacency, which have been exacerbated by widely circulated prophecies that demographic changes will give the Democrats a reliable national majority. A careful reading of these "ascendant America" prophets -- Ruy Teixeira and John Judis in 2002, the Atlantic's Ron Brownstein and pollster Stanley Greenberg more recently -- makes clear that these trends don't operate automatically.
To prosper from demographic change, a party has to address the issues of the day convincingly and field candidates with appropriate strengths. It also needs to avoid unnecessarily alienating old constituencies. An acquaintance with history shows that when a party gains support from one growing group, the opposition party can gain even more from groups with opposing views even if they're getting smaller.
That's what happened in 2016. Rising percentages of Hispanics and Asians and the increasing liberalism of college graduates and unmarried women were supposed to help carry Hillary Clinton to easy victory. Instead they were offset by sharp declines in Democratic support from white voters without college degrees in Rust Belt states from Pennsylvania through Iowa, and in Florida with its many Rust Belt retirees. And as the New York Times's Nate Cohn argued persuasively that year, noncollege whites are a significantly larger share of the electorate than exit polls have indicated -- even if their numbers are slowly declining.
Democratic strategists -- especially whoever advised Hillary Clinton to attack voters as "deplorables" -- seem to have assumed that noncollege whites in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin and Iowa would continue to vote as heavily Democratic as they had between 1992 and 2012. That made some sense: Recent elections had shown unusually small changes in partisan preferences. But the "blue wall" in these states was never very high, and treating voters with contempt was no way to shore it up.
The assumption was that the Democrats could keep these voters in line with promises of economic redistribution, appeals to the little guy, and attacks on big corporations. But 21st-century Democratic presidential candidates have raised and spent more money than Republicans and have run even with or ahead of them among the highest-income voters. Target-state voters may feel confident that Democrats will raise taxes on the rich, but they doubt benefits will flow to them. They might have noticed that the costs of subsidized college and health care have exploded over the years, while food and clothing, left to the market, have gotten cheaper. And for voters with modest incomes, cultural issues may be more important than economic self-interest. The same is true for affluent supporters of abortion and gay rights.
Democrats -- voters as well as politicians -- suffer from cultural insularity. Social psychologist Jonathan Haidt and his colleagues have shown that conservatives are better at understanding liberal views than the converse. That's not surprising: Whereas liberal views permeate the news media and popular culture, liberals can easily avoid exposure to conservative views. That distorts their view of the world and produces oversensitivity to leftist social-media mobs along with overconfidence in demographic trends.
All this tends to heighten the geographic overconcentration of Democratic votes in central cities, university towns and some suburbs. Republicans are spread more evenly. For the first time in American history, the most populous state is a political outlier. Mrs. Clinton's 2016 margin in California was 30 points.
A party with such concentrated support is at a disadvantage in the Senate and the Electoral College, as well as in the House and state legislatures, especially when the other party controls the redistricting process. The last two presidents were re-elected with 51% of the popular vote. But George W. Bush carried 255 congressional districts, Barack Obama only 209.
Faced with this disadvantage, some Democrats are talking about rewriting the rules to abolish or bypass the Electoral College. Others want to do away with equal representation of the states in the Senate, although under Article V of the Constitution, that would require the consent of every state.
If the Democrats don't beat Mr. Trump, sooner or later they'll alight on the sensible course -- take more-centrist positions and adopt conciliatory rhetoric. Bill Clinton did it in 1992: change your position on some issues and modify your rhetoric on others to win over the voters you need. That would enrage the mobs on campus and Twitter, and it's contrary to the approach taken by this year's leading contenders. But it had the distinct advantage of taking voters seriously -- and winning.

Texto completo: Potentially hazardous wiring inside Boeing Co.'s 737 MAX jets is the latest flashpoint between U.S. and European regulators and a further complication in the grounded fleet's return to service, according to people familiar with the details.
Technical experts at the European Union Aviation Safety Agency want certain electrical wires relocated to reduce what they say are dangers from potential short circuits, which in a worst-case scenario could disrupt flight-control systems, according to these people.
In addition to the Federal Aviation Administration's ongoing safety review of proposed fixes to the MAX, the European agency is independently vetting such changes.
But engineers at the Chicago plane maker and high-ranking FAA managers, including the agency's top safety official, contend moving the wiring isn't necessary, one of these people said. Boeing hasn't yet submitted its formal recommendation, though the issue is headed for a decision in the next few weeks by FAA head Steve Dickson.
The disagreement over whether to take action on the wiring, which hasn't been reported before, has prompted the FAA to hold off scheduling a key certification flight for the MAX. It also highlights the emergence of a series of new technical challenges and delays confronting the Chicago plane maker as it strives to get the MAX back in the air world-wide. The planes have been grounded since last March, following two fatal crashes that killed 346 people.
The planes are expected to gradually start resuming commercial flights sometime in the summer, with major U.S. carriers having removed them from schedules until June.
On Saturday, the FAA released a statement saying Boeing recently informed the agency "about concerns associated with the location of wiring in certain areas of the MAX." Since then, according to the statement, "the FAA has closely monitored the company's analysis and how the issue might affect the ongoing certification efforts." The wiring concerns were reported earlier by the New York Times.
Reiterating earlier statements, the FAA said the MAX will be approved to carry passengers again "only after our safety experts are fully satisfied that all safety-related issues are addressed."
A Boeing spokesman said the company is cooperating with international regulators on a thorough certification process, "and we are working to perform the appropriate analysis." He said, "It would be premature to speculate as to whether this analysis will lead to any design changes."
A spokeswoman for EASA, which hasn't submitted its final position to the FAA, declined to comment. The issues could be resolved with a compromise, but Boeing's priority at this point, according to some of the people familiar with the details, is avoiding any wire modifications.
The wires, which help control movable panels on the tail and power other systems, may be too close to each other in a dozen locations from the rear of the aircraft to the main electronics compartment beneath the cabin and behind the cockpit, according to the people familiar with the issue.
A short circuit, or "arcing" of electrical current between wires, could cause control problems for pilots that the FAA characterizes as hazardous or in some cases even catastrophic, according one of the people briefed on the details.
EASA and FAA technical experts, along with some other FAA officials responsible for certifying aircraft designs, have taken the position that safety rules require wiring modifications in such instances, this person said.
The relevant international rules relate to safety enhancements put in place more than a decade ago after an in-flight fire caused a Swissair jet to plunge into the water near Nova Scotia in 1998, killing all on board.
The current concerns about potential wiring problems stem from Boeing's analysis of how short circuits could cause problems with some flight-control systems, and how quickly pilots could react to those emergencies. Since the two fatal crashes, safety regulators have been reassessing certain MAX flight-control systems, changing software, adjusting related computers and modifying pilot training.
Last month, industry and government officials revealed the latest software glitch, a problem that prevents the jet's flight-control computers from powering up and verifying they are ready for flight, and said Boeing was working to resolve it.
Addressing the wiring issues would pose tough logistical and financial hurdles. How the agency mandates fixes may depend on who owns the aircraft, according to another person familiar with the details. The FAA may require Boeing to fix wiring on approximately 400 undelivered aircraft now in storage at airfields dotting the Puget Sound area, this person said.
For planes previously delivered to carriers, the agency would likely perform a risk analysis to determine whether the wiring should be repaired either before the planes fly again or during routinely scheduled maintenance, this person added.
Relocating the wiring bundles would take roughly two weeks per plane, according to industry and government experts. Such fixes could be performed at the same time as software and training updates, depending on available manpower, to try to minimize additional delays.

Texto completo: Maine's senior senator would do well to heed her own words from 2016 about the man who would become president.
She will say she tried her best.
She’ll note that she voted for witnesses in the impeachment trial of President Trump, but that vote fell short.
Then, when the final impeachment vote comes on Wednesday afternoon, expect Maine Sen. Susan Collins to fall back into the Republican line and vote to acquit.
Why? Because, you know, she needed more information from those who actually watched Trump make a mockery of the Oval Office. Witnesses who were blocked from testifying by Trump and his minions on Capitol Hill.
Buttressed by pages upon pages of detailed notes, Collins’ defense will all sound so logical, so well thought out. When it was all said and done, the reasoning will go, what else could she do?
Here’s what: Right now, Collins could do the same thing she did three and a half years ago, when Donald Trump was still just a candidate and few people dreamed that he’d ever darken the threshold of the White House.
Back then, she spoke up. Loudly and clearly.
She denounced the man for who he is and what he stands for.
She demonstrated integrity.
On Friday, as Trump’s impeachment trial roller-coasted toward its inevitable conclusion, I called up the Washington Post op-ed Collins wrote on Aug. 6, 2016, under the headline “Why I Cannot Support Trump.”
It’s a remarkable piece of writing. And now, as Trump shakes off impeachment and looks ahead to another election, Collins’ statement of conscience bears revisiting – if only to show that while Trump hasn’t changed, the senior senator from Maine most certainly has.
“With the passage of time, I have become increasingly dismayed by his constant stream of cruel comments and his inability to admit error or apologize,” Collins wrote of Trump. “But it was his attacks directed at people who could not respond on an equal footing – either because they do not share his power or stature or because professional responsibility precluded them from engaging at such a level – that revealed Mr. Trump as unworthy of being our president.”
Former ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch comes to mind. Even as she testified to the House Intelligence Committee in November about her unceremonious ouster on the cusp of the Ukraine scandal, Trump took to Twitter to heckle her in real time, prompting the committee chairman, Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., to ask what effect Trump’s bullying could have on “other witnesses’ willingness to come forward and expose wrongdoing.”
“It’s very intimidating,” a visibly uncomfortable Yovanovitch replied.
What say you now, Sen. Collins?
In her op-ed, Collins also stated: “My conclusion about Mr. Trump’s unsuitability for office is based on his disregard for the precept of treating others with respect, an idea that should transcend politics. Instead, he opts to mock the vulnerable and inflame prejudices by attacking ethnic and religious minorities.”
She cited three examples: A New York Times reporter whose disability Trump once mimicked, a federal judge who Trump said could not fairly decide a case because of the judge’s Mexican heritage, and the Muslim family of Army Capt. Humayun Khan, who was killed in Iraq.
In all three cases, Collins wrote, she hoped Trump would apologize, admit that he was wrong. He didn’t. In fact, he would go on to call victims of Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico “politically motivated ingrates,” decry immigrants coming to the United States from “s***hole countries,” and fire off countless other invectives on virtually a daily basis.
What say you now, Sen. Collins?
Back then, Collins worried that Trump’s “lack of self-restraint and his barrage of ill-informed comments would make an already perilous world even more so. It is reckless for a presidential candidate to publicly raise doubts about honoring treaty commitments with our allies. Mr. Trump’s tendency to lash out when challenged further escalates the possibility of disputes spinning dangerously out of control.”
She was right. Trump went on to arbitrarily withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement on climate change and the Iran nuclear treaty. Just last month, his impulsive assassination of Iranian Maj. Gen. Qasem Soleimani came perilously close to spawning all-out war in the Middle East.
What say you now, Sen. Collins?
As the country geared up for the 2016 general election, Collins wrote that she’d hoped for a “new” Donald Trump, “one who would focus on jobs and the economy, tone down his rhetoric, develop more thoughtful policies and, yes, apologize for ill-tempered rants.”
Again, she proved prescient: “But the unpleasant reality that I have had to accept is that there will be no ‘new’ Donald Trump, just the same candidate who will slash and burn and trample anything and anyone he perceives as being in his way or an easy scapegoat. Regrettably, his essential character appears to be fixed, and he seems incapable of change or growth.”
That, of course, was long before Trump called House Intelligence Committee Chairman Schiff “pencil neck,” told Russian diplomats that former FBI Director James Comey was a “nut job” and called various women “fat pig,” “slob,” “dog” and “horseface.”
What say you now, Sen. Collins?
Long proud of her Republican heritage – she called it “part of what defines me as a person” – Collins wrote that some might consider her duty-bound to support her party’s presidential nominee. But, she countered, “It is because of Mr. Trump’s inability and unwillingness to honor that legacy that I am unable to support his candidacy.”
And now? As the Senate makes history before our eyes, we find Collins studiously riveted to the process, hiding behind her faux-obligation as a “juror” to avoid having to state the obvious once again.
Donald Trump is indeed “unworthy of being our president,” as Collins put it so long ago. He not only solicited a foreign government to dig up dirt on his political rival, but also upped the pressure on Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky by withholding $391 million in desperately needed military aid.
Last week, Trump attorney Alan Dershowitz had the temerity to say that as long as Trump thought his re-election is in the public interest, he can engage in such behavior without consequence. Around the same time, more than a few Republicans said the president’s transgressions simply don’t rise to the level of impeachment.
Susan Collins knows better than that. She knows the kind of man Donald J. Trump truly is. She knows that now more than ever, he’s unfit to occupy the most powerful office in the land.
But times have changed. The man she criticized so roundly back then is the same man who can take a flamethrower to her political future now.
So, come Wednesday and the final impeachment vote, look for Collins to express her deep concern at how nasty everyone has become, wring her hands over how difficult her life has grown and then, ever loyal to a party that now devours those who dissent, vote to let Trump off the hook. Or maybe vote “present” in the hope it will satisfy both ends of her ever-shrinking base.
It won’t. And long after this national trauma passes into history, Maine’s Susan Collins will be forever remembered not for her courage, but for her capitulation.

Texto completo: An editorial from
the New York Post
CNN host Don Lemon and his elite panelists showed their true colors last week - by mocking "hillbilly" Trump supporters.
And the Republican National Committee is using it against the anti-Trump trio in a new ad, which also sprinkles in Hillary Clinton's infamous "basket of deplorables" barb and other Democrats' bigoted remarks about Trump supporters.
It all began on Mr. Lemon's show after he criticized Secretary of State Mike Pompeo for the way he challenged an NPR reporter to point to Ukraine on a map.
Then one guest, Never-Trump GOP consultant Rick Wilson, took it off the cliff: Mr. Pompeo "knows deep within his heart that Donald Trump couldn't find Ukraine on a map if you had the letter U and a picture of an actual physical crane next to it," Mr. Wilson smirked, with Mr. Lemon chuckling along.
"He knows that this is, you know, an administration defined by ignorance of the world. And so that's partly him playing to the base and playing to their audience. You know, the credulous boomer rube that backs Donald Trump," Mr. Wilson finished - adding, in a Southern drawl: "Donald Trump's the smart one - and y'all elitists are dumb!"
New York Times columnist Wajahat Ali then joined in the mockery: "You elitists with your geography and your maps and your spelling."
Of course, Mr. Pompeo was plainly suggesting (in a conversation he thought was off the record, by the way) that the NPR reporter was ignorant.
But the CNN panel couldn't resist using it for an out-of-nowhere attack on those "boomer rubes" - once again exposing their own ignorant bias.
Mr. Lemon later offered a paltry apology, saying he was laughing at a joke and not at Trump supporters - who he plainly thinks are dumb enough to believe him.
People like Don Lemon are shocked when someone like Donald Trump wins an election or does well in any polling. What they don't understand is that this - elites' smug dismissal of average Americans - is exactly why.

IOWA CAUCUS POLL SHELVED BY ANOMALY

Texto completo: A highly anticipated poll of Iowa Democrats, set to be released two days before the presidential caucuses, was shelved Saturday night because of concerns about irregularities in the methodology.
The apparent problem, raised by aides to Pete Buttigieg, prompted CNN to cancel an hourlong special organized to release the results of the survey, conducted with The Des Moines Register.
The results were held back after the Buttigieg campaign said an Iowa supporter received a call from an operator working for the polling operation but that the name of the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., was not listed on the menu of options.
Lis Smith, a senior adviser to the Buttigieg campaign, said they shared the information with the media organizations, which conducted an internal investigation.
The poll is conducted from a call center, where operators read from a script of candidates' names to determine whom a voter plans to support. One operator had apparently enlarged the font size on the computer screen, perhaps cutting off Mr. Buttigieg's name, according to two people familiar with the incident who did not have permission to speak about it publicly.
After every phone call, the list of candidates' names is randomly reordered, so Mr. Buttigieg may not have been uniquely affected by the error, one of the people said. But the poll's overseers were unable to determine if the mistake was an isolated incident.
David Chalian, CNN's political director, said on-air that CNN and The Register decided "out of an abundance of caution" not to release the poll.

Texto completo: A few days ago, The New York Times' Vows column ran a correction for the ages. In a story about two actors wooing and wedding, the writer let slip that Jane Austen wrote the famous vampire novel “Dracula."
While it's true that there is a recent novel named “Pride and Prejudice and Vampires," Jane Austen never wrote about the Transylvanian undead. After ticking off a few other mistakes in the article, the Times explained: “Also, the author of 'Dracula' was incorrect. He is Bram Stoker, not Jane Austen."
The world guffawed. Me, not so much.
I have a hard-won empathy for writers who make mistakes because I've made my share. A brief overview of My Life in Error would include misidentifying the former publisher of The Boston Globe, and miscalculating the age of my great hero, Prince Charles.
An officious doctoral drone once chided me for misspelling Zlatni Pyasatsi (“Golden Sands"), the name of a famous-if-occasionally-overlooked Black Sea Bulgarian beach resort that I had grown used to calling by its Russian name, Zolotye Piski.
If you want to avoid mistakes, it's best to avoid names generally, e.g., Dan Aykroyd or Edgar Allan Poe, whose names the Times has misspelled, collectively, over a hundred times. A former Globe editor used to obsess about the correct spelling of the late Washington Post owner Katharine Graham, who read the paper while summering on Martha's Vineyard.
Inevitably, we blew it once or twice by spelling her name with an extra “e."
I have always had a jaundiced view of journalistic accuracy because my first paying job in journalism was fact-checking for Newsweek magazine. On occasion, “facts" proved to be pretty much whatever the Newsweek editors wanted them to be. Maybe I should have attended journalism school instead.
Many years ago, I ascended my private Everest of Error, misspelling former baseball commissioner Fay Vincent's name —“Faye," omigod. Then, in the ensuing correction, I called him the “late" baseball commissioner, prompting yet another published climb-down.
Vincent, who read the Globe for its excellent baseball coverage, could not have been more gracious when I contacted him to apologize. “That's why pencils have erasers," he said.
Most books contain a few errors, and it's always hard to figure out how they got there, given that dozens of editors and subeditors graze over the text. A few years ago, I wrote a book about Alexander Pushkin's novel-in-verse, “Eugene Onegin" (I know, I know), and a mistake crept in.
A professor at the Santa Fe Institute, a “theoretical research institute located in Santa Fe and dedicated to the multidisciplinary study of the fundamental principles of complex adaptive systems," according to Wikipedia, alerted me to my mistake:
“In your description of the masculine and feminine rhymes on page 73, I believe you have an extra 'm': it should be fmfmffmmfmmfmm, rather than fmfmffmmmfmmfmm."
Darned if he wasn't right! I sincerely promised to include the correction in the paperback edition, tentatively scheduled for publication in the year Never.
Back in the dawn of time — 1996, to be accurate — I wrote an article for Slate magazine that misplaced the US-Canadian border at the 48th instead of the 49th parallel. Slate was one of the very rare online magazines at the time, so I helpfully suggested that we rearrange a few pixels, change “48" to “49," and no one would be the wiser.
But the then-editor, Michael Kinsley, saw a chance to make Internet history. We will publish the first-ever online correction , he declared. Naturally, I was honored to take my place in this hastily convened digital Hall of Shame.
The article is still easy to find, but the first-of-its-kind correction has sunk under the shifting sands of time. The error remains in the text. If only they had listened to me. But that is the story of my life.

AJC LOCAL IN-DEPTH 2020 ELECTIONS: Legitimate nicknames or a ploy for votes? DeKalb officials weigh in

Texto completo: Over the years, Georgia has seen its fair share of politicians who go by distinctive names, from James H. "Sloppy" Floyd to James "Bubber" Epps. But a current race in DeKalb County has reignited a discussion over the legality -- and legitimacy -- of nicknames on the ballot.
In the crowded special election for DeKalb sheriff, two hopefuls qualified to run using nicknames as their middle names. Ruth "The Truth" Stringer, a former sheriff's office major who has served as interim sheriff, and Antonio "Block" Johnson, the former marshal of Fulton County, are set to face off against seven others in the March 24 election.
Both Stringer and Johnson said friends and peers in the community call them by those monikers. But they drew the attention of the county elections board at its most recent meeting.
The five-member board got a crash course in state law related to informal titles on the ballot. Candidates cannot list titles like military rank, "Dr.," "Rev." or "Judge," but they are allowed to include nicknames by which they are "commonly known in the community," according to the secretary of state's office.
However -- and this is the key provision -- those names can't include a "spurious" phrase or "political slogan or message." That means "John 'Johnny' Doe" would likely be all right. "John 'Vote for Me' Doe"? Probably not.
State officials wanted the DeKalb elections board to determine whether "The Truth" was more of a political message than an actual nickname.
"I received a call from the secretary of state's office," DeKalb elections director Erica Hamilton said at the meeting in January. "I recommend that we remove 'The Truth' and just have her as 'Ruth Stringer' on the ballot."
Stringer addressed the board and said she received the nickname "Truth"while serving in the U.S. Marine Corps 30 years ago.
"A general gave me that name, so it has nothing to do with this election," she said, adding that people still call her by that name. "It's not political for me."
Johnson, who was not at the meeting, said in an interview recently that he got the nickname from his family when he was 5 years old and a big fan of "Peanuts" cartoon character Charlie Brown, AKA "blockhead."
"I used to watch it so much, so they started calling me "Block,'" he said, adding that it's how he's commonly known in the law enforcement community. He said not having the nickname on the ballot might hurt his chances of name recognition with voters.
"If they got to the ballot box and they just see 'Antonio Johnson' ... most people don't know my first name," he said.
During the meeting, Hamilton pointed out that voters are used to seeing unique nicknames in politics; she brought up "Able" Mable Thomas, a longtime state representative from Atlanta.
Thomas has been cleared to use "Able" as her nickname on the ballot, according to a spokesman for the secretary of state, who pointed out that the state's elections division is located in the "Sloppy Floyd Building," named after the late state representative who said he got the nickname in high school and used it the rest of his life.
In Cobb County, there's Steve "Thunder" Tumlin, the current mayor of Marietta and a former state representative. He used the nickname on the ballot when running for reelection in 2013;he has said he got the nickname as an infant, when his older sister thought his squalling sounded like thunder.
And of course, this isn't just a Georgia thing. A well-known judge and former Mississippi state representative in the mid-1950s went by "Soggy" Sweat. In last fall's elections in Louisiana, candidates' nicknames included Ralph "Rem" Brandt, "Jeff Big Daddy" Naquin, Joseph "Mr.Me" Oliver Jr. and Aaron "The Fixer" Staten, according to WAFB 9News in Baton Rouge.
Other infamous nicknames have been more explicitly political. Byron Looper, a candidate for tax assessor in Putnam County, Tennessee, in 1996, had his middle name legally changed from "Anthony" to "(Low Tax)" to get his political message across on the ballot, according to The New York Times. He had moved to Tennessee after running unsuccessfully for the Georgia House eight years earlier. Looper, however, is perhaps more widely known for being convicted of murdering his opponent in a race for state Senate in 1998 just weeks before the election. He died in prison in 2013, the Chattanooga Times Free Press reported.
In the (much less controversial) race for DeKalb County sheriff, Stringer brought up to the elections board that Johnson was allowed to use "Block" as his nickname. Hamilton said the secretary of state's office only asked the board to review Stringer's nickname, but other officials said it was important to have even standards for candidates' nicknames.
"I just think we need to be consistent," said Dele Low-man Smith, one of the elections board members.
The officials ultimately decided that Stringer's explanation for her nickname was sufficient and ruled that DeKalb voters will see both "The Truth" and "Block" on the March 24 ballot.
"I think that the board was fair with their decision," Stringer said in an interview recently. "You can't treat one candidate differently than you treat the others."

Democratic Hopefuls Make Final Appeals in a Blurred Caucus Race

Texto completo: Bernie Sanders is increasingly seen as the candidate on the rise. But the Iowa contest is unusually jumbled, and several candidates have realistic hopes for a sudden burst of momentum.
DES MOINES -- The Democratic presidential candidates pleaded with voters in Iowa for their last-minute consideration on Sunday, competing with the Super Bowl for caucusgoers' attention and straining against an atmosphere of unusual uncertainty and indecision among Democrats ahead of the first-in-the-nation nominating contest.
The cancellation on Saturday night of a final pre-caucus poll from The Des Moines Register and CNN, because of a survey error, frustrated campaigns that had come to depend on the poll as a reliable omen of caucus results. But strategists for several campaigns said there was a deepening sense that Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont had an advantage ahead of Monday's contest.
Public polling has shown Mr. Sanders gaining ground, and he has outspent all of the other leading Democrats on television by a wide margin in recent weeks. A New York Times polling average found Mr. Sanders and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. tied for first place in the state, with each of them collecting support from about 22 percent of likely caucusgoers. Trailing them in third and fourth place were former Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.
Mr. Sanders campaigned on Sunday in a confident tone, concluding a speech in Iowa City by standing beside his wife, Jane, and urging the crowd to imagine them in the White House: "Some of you are unhappy with me and some of you think I might not be a great president," he said. "Understand, she will be a great first lady!"
Should Mr. Sanders emerge as a convincing victor from Monday's caucuses, he would aim to carry that momentum forward into next week's primary in New Hampshire, where he was already seen as having an upper hand, and the Nevada caucuses later this month. But there is still widespread concern among Democratic Party leaders and center-left primary voters about the implications of nominating a self-described democratic socialist to take on President Trump. Mr. Sanders's allies acknowledge there is little chance he will be able to lock up the nomination without a long fight.
His chief opponents are unlikely to give way easily: Even if he is defeated here, Mr. Biden has a strong national following among moderate voters and African-Americans, while Ms. Warren retains a sizable base among educated liberals and women. And Michael R. Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York City, is looming as a competitor in the March primary states.
Mr. Biden, who has long anchored his campaign in appeals to electoral prudence, tried on Sunday to remind Democrats that the G.O.P. sees him as a strong general-election candidate. He pointed to a morning appearance on CNN by Senator Joni Ernst, the Iowa Republican, in which Ms. Ernst again suggested that Iowa voters might draw unfavorable conclusions about Mr. Biden as a result of Republican attacks on him during Mr. Trump's impeachment trial. Iowans, Ms. Ernst said, were "very smart."
"Why don't you let Joni Ernst know just how smart you are, and caucus for me?" Mr. Biden said, earning a standing ovation from voters in Dubuque.
Calling the impeachment process a "sham trial," Mr. Biden encouraged Iowans to "hold Trump accountable" by supporting the former vice president on Monday.
But in an outlandish episode that seemed to reflect some senior Democrats' alarm about Mr. Sanders's strength here, NBC reported on Sunday afternoon that John F. Kerry, the former secretary of state, had been overheard in a Des Moines hotel talking about the possibility of entering the presidential race to stop Mr. Sanders from "taking down the Democratic Party."
Mr. Kerry, who has been campaigning across the state as a surrogate for Mr. Biden, wrote on Twitter that he was "absolutely not running for president" and reaffirmed his support for Mr. Biden. But he notably did not deny having had the conversation NBC reported.
If Democratic voters had been anxious, even tortured, about the task of choosing just one option in the 2020 race, over the weekend there was visible enthusiasm for many of the candidates, who were addressing swollen audiences on college campuses and in local gymnasiums.
"The bad news is, there's no more room inside," Ms. Warren joked to an overflow crowd at Simpson College. "The good news is, there's no more room inside!"
Mr. Buttigieg, who addressed a crowd of about 2,000 people on the South Side of Des Moines on Sunday, acknowledged to reporters that his campaign had to clear a high bar on Monday. Among the top candidates in Iowa, Mr. Buttigieg has by far the most ground to make up in national polls and he is counting on a burst of new energy.
"Let's face it, we need a very strong finish here," he told reporters in Coralville. "This is our chance to show-versus-tell that we're building the organization that can turn people out and go on to defeat Donald Trump."
The senators in the mix repeatedly indicated to voters that they had felt constrained in their campaign activities by an impeachment process that kept them tethered to Washington. Ms. Warren skipped her signature photo lines, explaining regretfully that she needed to "get around to as much of Iowa as possible." Her internet-famous dog, Bailey, was stepping in to be photographed in her stead.
Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, who has been contesting Iowa as a vigorous underdog, implored voters here to "have my back" because she had to return to Washington briefly to attend to impeachment duties on Monday. "I wish I could be here at the very last moment, but I can't," she told voters in Cedar Rapids.
Ms. Klobuchar, Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders were all planning to make hit-and-run appearances in Washington on Monday before returning to Iowa for the night of the caucuses.
While a hectic scramble was underway in Iowa, a separate political feud, with potential implications for the Democratic primary, was unfolding on television and social media -- between Mr. Trump and Mr. Bloomberg.
Mr. Bloomberg, who is skipping Iowa and using his multibillion-dollar fortune to saturate later-voting states with advertising, has been largely outside the political foreground in the run-up to the caucuses. But Mr. Trump changed that with an overnight diatribe on Twitter, belittling Mr. Bloomberg's modest height and accusing the Democratic establishment of favoring him over Mr. Sanders.
Mr. Bloomberg, whose lavishly financed campaign was also running an ad during the Super Bowl, responded in a tart fashion that delighted some liberals. His spokeswoman, Julie Wood, said in a statement that Mr. Trump was "a pathological liar who lies about everything: his fake hair, his obesity and his spray-on tan."
If the exchange was less than dignified, it was also a reminder of Mr. Bloomberg's looming presence in the race and the possibility that he could wind up as a last-man-standing option for centrist Democrats if Mr. Sanders dominated the early primaries and caucuses this month.
Reporting was contributed by Sydney Ember from Iowa City, Reid J. Epstein from Coralville, Iowa, Shane Goldmacher from Indianola, and Katie Glueck from Dubuque.

Demi Lovato, 'Anyone'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Demi Lovato is 27, but has lived much longer. A former Disney star, and the one who consistently had the most conflicted relationship to that enterprise, she emerged in her late teenage years as a pop star with a big voice and unexpected edge. But she also struggled with addiction, and in 2018, she suffered an opioid overdose. "Anyone," which she premiered at the Grammy Awards on Sunday night, is her first single since then -- a pensive eruption, a harrowing peal. It moves slowly and determinedly, and not totally steadily, which is the point -- recovery is not a straight line. The pain here is palpable, and Lovato wields it like a weapon and a shield. She's a torch singer for our modern era, which asks too much of those too young, and doesn't stop until it breaks them. JON CARAMANICA
Dua Lipa, 'Physical'
Little Dragon, 'Hold On'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Let's have some fun, this beat is sick: There is hope for upbeat pop in 2020. The first song from a Little Dragon album due March 27 is an electro-soul benediction for an undramatic relationship set to a low simmer. The third track from Dua Lipa's "Future Nostalgia" (out April 3) cleverly threads Olivia Newton-John's 1981 song "Physical" through Lady Gaga's album "The Fame." It's not as icon-clad as Lipa's "Don't Start Now," but it has enough sizzle to winningly live up to the album's title. CARYN GANZ
Torres, 'Good Scare'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Torres -- the singer and songwriter Mackenzie Scott -- ponders the volatility of romance and the relation between life and art in "Good Scare" from her new album, "Silver Tongue." Booming percussion and sustained electric guitar tones give her a spacious backdrop as she observes a partner who's scaring her by "eyeing all the exits"; her reaction is to think about writing a country song. This is not one. JON PARELES
Sturgill Simpson, 'A Good Look'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Will people learn line-dance moves from an anime? Sturgill Simpson, the insurgent roots-rocker, thinks they might. The underlying structure of "A Good Look" is funky blues-rock, but its sliding synthesizers and nonstop bass line make it feel machine-driven. And while Simpson is singing about all the things that compromise heartfelt songwriting -- image, commerce, "you know they don't like it when you take a stand" -- the video clip is all artificial glee. Enjoy the paradox. PARELES
Meek Mill featuring Roddy Ricch, 'Letter to Nipsey'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
An earthy, uplifting tribute to Nipsey Hussle from Meek Mill with Roddy Ricch, one of Nipsey's protégés. (They premiered it at the Grammys on Sunday.) Meek is in reflective storytelling mode, with scars still fresh: "When we lost you it really put some pain on me/Got me scared to go outside without that flame on me." And Roddy sings his way through the pain. Even his melancholy is sweet, a balm for a feeling that's never anything other than terrible. CARAMANICA
Kate Tempest, 'Unholy Elixir'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
"Our songs were spells and our spells were plain facts," Kate Tempest declares in "Unholy Elixir." She's more a poet than a rapper, but her recordings make the music an equal partner. "Unholy Elixir" feels unstable but obstinate from the start, with deep, wavery, not-quite-in-tune synthesizers and a lurching beat; other synthesizer riffs arrive to turn the track into glowering synth-pop. Tempest confronts excuses for apathy -- "don't bother protesting because nobody listens" -- but warns, "You better start sowing or there won't be a harvest." PARELES
Braids, 'Young Buck'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Insistent, relentless six-beat patterns run nearly nonstop as Raphaelle Standell-Preston, of the Canadian band Braids, sings about lust overcoming rationality. Her "Young Buck," she knows, is "the blaring example of what I am drawn towards/and should strongly move away from." Layers of counterpoint accrue as her better judgment fades; it's math-rock versus irresistible impulses. PARELES
Jah Wobble featuring Keith Levene, Richard Dudanski, Mark Stewart, Andy Weatherall and Youth, 'A Very British Coup'
Jah Wobble, the original bass player in Public Image Ltd., and other post-punk alumni -- Keith Levene from the early Clash and Public Image Ltd., Mark Stewart from the Pop Group, Youth from Killing Joke -- greet Brexit with the fractious "A Very British Coup." It's a dense, ever-shifting collage, variously hinting at ska-punk, Britpop, fiddle tunes and "Sympathy for the Devil," with barbed bits of lyrics like "sordid, sentimental, sick souvenirs" and "Even the devil sold his soul." In 2020, post-punk disgust and cynicism aren't dated. PARELES
Destroyer, 'It Just Doesn't Happen'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Dan Bejar, who records as Destroyer, has a fey tenor voice perfectly made for easy whimsy. But this is not a playful era, and he knows it. On his new album, "Have We Met," the idiom he chose is the reverberant, electronics-enhanced, early MTV tone of confidence with hidden misgivings. "It Just Doesn't Happen" begins, "You're looking good/in spite of the light," and that ambivalence persists; it's a portrait of the artist as winner, loser and lost soul. PARELES
Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra (featuring Wayne Shorter), 'Contemplation'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
If Wayne Shorter is something like jazz's Pablo Picasso -- a master composer of the modern era who never abandoned tonality and form, but was constantly finding new ways to turn them upside down -- then the Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra works as a gilded frame to display his masterpieces. Members of the 15-piece big band, led by the trumpeter Wynton Marsalis, wrote arrangements of compositions from throughout Shorter's career, and the orchestra performed them with him at Rose Hall in 2015. A glorious moment came on "Contemplation," one of Shorter's early works, first recorded with Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers in 1961. Playing it with the orchestra, he takes the tune's only solo, subtly harking to the hollering style of the early R&B saxophonists he grew up hearing. But his blues phrasing often veers toward abstraction, his notes smearing and disappearing without an alibi -- like a nose on a canvas shrewdly misplaced. GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO
The Westerlies, 'Eli'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
An arty quartet featuring two trumpeters and two trombonists, mixing ideas from jazz, new classical and Appalachian folk, the Westerlies don't really have the option of doing a straightforward cover of most songs. That's doubly true when they're dealing with Arthur Russell, the experimental-pop cellist and vocalist. His music is about melody and counterpoint, but it's also about the grain of his voice, and treating sound as humid atmosphere. On this rendition of Russell's "Eli," the Westerlies smartly lean into the tune's blend of harmonic splendor and hollering lament -- and they're mindful of the need for some textural play. One of the trombonists folded tin foil across the bell of his horn, creating a restless sibilance underneath the crystal tones and rough growls of his bandmates. RUSSONELLO

Texto completo: In an audiotape message, Al Qaeda's leader in Yemen claimed responsibility for the December attack that killed three U.S. sailors. The militant himself was most likely killed in a drone strike after he made the tape.
CAIRO -- Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula claimed on Sunday that it directed a Saudi military officer to carry out the shooting at a United States military base in Florida in December that killed three sailors and wounded eight people.
In an audio recording released on Sunday, the leader of the Yemen-based group, Qassim al-Rimi, claimed responsibility for the Dec. 6 attack at Naval Air Station Pensacola, according to SITE, an organization that tracks jihadist media.
The group offered no evidence that it had trained the gunman, Second Lt. Mohammed Saeed Alshamrani, but produced a copy of his will as well as correspondence that indicated he had been in contact with Al Qaeda. Experts said those elements gave the claim a plausible air.
Mr. al-Rimi, the Qaeda leader, may himself be dead. He was the target of an American drone strike in eastern Yemen last week, according to American and Yemeni officials who said they believed he had been killed but were awaiting confirmation.
On Saturday, President Trump fueled speculation that confirmation had been received when he retweeted several messages and a media report about Mr. al-Rimi's death.
The 21-year-old Saudi Air Force trainee who carried out the Pensacola attack was not a known member of Al Qaeda. A sheriff's deputy shot him dead during the attack, and his family in Saudi Arabia said it was mystified by his actions.
But F.B.I. investigators have said they were following leads that Mr. Alshamrani had been influenced by extremists as early as 2015. And on Sunday, Al Qaeda provided a purported copy of a last will written in September.
The group also cited from correspondence with the young Saudi officer, in which he described his life on the American base.
"The program is called Aviation Preflight Introduction," one letter read. "I started with the running tests last Friday and I passed them, thank God. On Monday the swimming tests will start for a week, followed by five weeks of academic tests."
At a news conference last month, the F.B.I. deputy director, David Bowdich, said that while Mr. Alshamrani did not appear to be motivated by one specific terrorist group, he harbored anti-American and anti-Israeli views. His social media comments echoed those of Anwar al-Awlaki, the radical Yemeni-American cleric and senior leader of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula who was killed in a drone strike in 2011, Mr. Bowdich said.
On Sunday, SITE said that Mr. Alshamrani posted a short manifesto on Twitter before the attack that read: "I'm against evil, and America as a whole has turned into a nation of evil." The Twitter account has been suspended.
"The timing of this audio is designed to cause maximum humiliation for Trump, who had just retweeted reports of al-Rimi's death," said Bruce Riedel, a scholar at the Brookings Institution and a former C.I.A. officer. "It's also a statement that AQAP has infiltrated the Saudi military, which is an embarrassment for the Saudis."
Colin P. Clarke, a senior fellow at the Soufan Center, a New York-based research organization, said that Al Qaeda's claim to have directed Mr. Alshamrani could well be legitimate.
"This makes the F.B.I.'s battle with Apple for access to Alshamrani's phone even that much more critical," he said, referring to a dispute over Apple's refusal to unlock the shooter's iphone.
Mr. al-Rimi, 41, led a potent branch of Al Qaeda that, despite some serious setbacks in recent years, still harbored ambitions of carrying out attack in the United States and Europe.
In 2018, the United States doubled a reward for information about Mr. al-Rimi's whereabouts to $ 10 million. The C.I.A. picked up his trail in November, officials told The New York Times last week.
He had been considered a potential successor to Ayman al-Zawahri, the overall leader of Al Qaeda, said Rita Katz of SITE.
Last month, the United States Justice Department said it was sending home 21 Saudi students from the Pensacola base after they were found to be in possession of jihadist material or pornography.
Attorney General Bill Barr said the Saudi government had undertaken to review each case under its code of military justice. Pornography is forbidden in the kingdom.
Reporting was contributed by Eric Schmitt in Washington, Saeed al-Batati in Al Mukalla, Yemen, and Nada Rashwan in Cairo.

Texto completo: In November, I became a temporary resident to get to know the state, its people and the candidates trying to win their support ahead of the caucuses.
Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
DES MOINES -- I was in a tree.
It was November and I had been in Iowa for less than a month, living there to be The New York Times's eyes and ears on the ground in the critical run-up to the Iowa caucuses. During one of my first weeks there, I set out to write a profile on an interesting person with political clout who would help bring Iowa to life for our readers. Rob Sand, the state auditor, pitched himself as a subject -- and then took me bowhunting for deer.
Bowhunting would involve climbing a tree and then waiting in a tree stand for a deer to come into view. I didn't know this. There would be little talking because deer hunting involves being very quiet. I also didn't know this.
About an hour in, as my fingers and toes lost feeling in the cold and we both stood silently in the tree, I thought: What am I doing here?
As a political reporter for The Times, I am used to traveling across the country to speak to voters and observe candidates on the campaign trail. But those stays don't usually last much longer than several days at a time.
So this was a question I sometimes asked myself during my three-month stint in Iowa, especially on long drives in snowstorms between events in rural parts of the state. That was not something I learned how to do growing up in Southern California.
I still don't have the best answer, but here is what I know: My goal was to understand Iowa -- the people who live here and the issues they care about -- in addition to the presidential candidates who spend a good part of their time and resources in the state and the web of volunteers, staff members and strategists who help them.
I spent many of my days attending campaign events in high school gymnasiums and college auditoriums and senior centers, analyzing the candidates' messages and talking to voters to see whether those messages were resonating. I also spent a good deal of time getting coffee or drinks or meals with people -- campaign staff members, Iowa experts and sometimes Iowans I met along the way.
I drove thousands of miles in my rented Chevy Equinox. I wrote thousands of words sitting at the table in my rented apartment.
I learned that many Democrats here want above all to beat President Trump -- a desire that made it extraordinarily difficult for them to choose a candidate. Some Republicans and independents wanted that, too.
I learned that campaign events all have different vibes. Town hall events for Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., for instance, are lively and fun and all last about exactly the same amount of time (less than an hour). Events for Bernie Sanders, the senator from Vermont, can be powerfully emotional for people in the audience, many of whom share their experiences with a system they and Mr. Sanders view as broken.
I learned that cars with all-wheel drive can still fishtail in the snow and that pizza from Casey's General Store is delicious. (But no, I did not try the breakfast pizza, a particularly polarizing Iowa delicacy.)
It might be more practical, and less expensive, for The Times and other news organizations not to move reporters out to Iowa before the caucuses. But there is no substitute for spending a lot of time here, talking to Iowans every day and experiencing the all-consuming nature of the run-up to the state's caucuses firsthand.
A veteran political reporter for The Times, Adam Nagourney, told me when I got here to try to eat dinner with someone every night as part of my fact-finding mission, but also because it would make the experience less lonely. I followed his advice, and he was right.
An editor once referred to this as my "Iowa tour of duty." It was definitely much easier than being deployed, but I will say I am happy to be going home, even if it's just for a few nights before I am sent out on the trail again.
And before you ask, yes, I did get myself a warm winter jacket.
And no, I don't know who is going to win.

Texto completo: Readers offer suggestions to deal with "surveillance capitalism."
To the Editor:
Re "The Known Unknown," by Shoshana Zuboff (Sunday Review, Jan. 26):
Ms. Zuboff warns of the dangers of surveillance capitalism. Her solution is for the government to pass new laws limiting the ability of surveillance capitalists to use the data they collect. In a perfect world, this would be a reasonable response. In the real world, with our current government, this has pretty much zero chance of success.
Here's another idea: Delete your Facebook account. Use a search engine other than Google, and don't use Gmail. Don't buy anything on Amazon. Don't use Microsoft products. Don't allow Alexa or any other listening device into your home. Don't install anything to make your home "smart." And use your smartphone with a little discretion and thoughtfulness.
These are things each and every one of us can do. There are alternatives to all of the products and services provided by the dominant surveillance capitalists. If we as citizens are truly concerned about our loss of privacy and individual agency, it's time to take a little personal responsibility for our digital lives.

Re "Total Surveillance Is Not What America Signed Up For" ("The Privacy Project," editorial, Jan. 26):
You say, Americans "deserve the freedom to choose a life without surveillance." Quite so.
I have exerted that power by the simple expedient of never having acquired a smartphone, averting "addiction" to such a device, saving time for better pursuits than gazing at a tiny screen, and staying out of the vast data set your special section so frighteningly describes.

Barring Iranian Students
To the Editor:
Re "Amid Tensions, U.S. Turns Away Iranian Students" (news article, Jan. 27):
I am heartsick to read about the many Iranians who were denied entry into the United States. Despite months of extensive vetting, being accepted for study, investing in airfare and leaving their jobs and homes, they were abruptly turned away and deported. This is America at its worst, not its best.
I lived in Iran for two years before the 1979 revolution. I have great love for the Iranian people and great respect for their culture. Very few Americans today have any direct experience with Iran, so it is easy to demonize the country and its people.
Neither the United States nor Iran is perfect, but both will gain from person-to-person contacts, building toward knowledge and understanding and away from preconceptions and ideology. Surely this is the wisest way to ensure our security.

Talking to Those With Cancer
To the Editor:
Re "What to Say to Someone With Cancer" (Personal Health, Jan. 14):
Much of the advice in Jane E. Brody's column is excellent. But some of it is confoundingly restrictive. To tell readers, for example, that a perfectly reasonable offer like "call me if you need anything" is "unhelpful or off-putting" might lead them to say nothing, and that would be a shame.
Though I have been sitting with my diagnosis for four months, it took me until today, when I finally got my first shot and took the first of the pills I will probably take every day for the rest of my life, to fully believe that cancer was happening to me. How could I possibly expect my friends and family to respond to the news in a way I find fulfilling when I hardly know how to respond myself?
Cancer is terrifying for everyone, and we need to talk about it more, not less. There will be awkward reactions and wonderful ones. So what if some reactions are clumsy? We ought to take time to educate the people we care about, and focus on those who surprise us in wonderful ways. Why invent slights where none were intended?

Texto completo: The money will help the organization fund its program for poets laureate in cities and communities around the United States.
The Academy of American Poets said on Thursday that it would be able to fund its poet laureate program for the next three years with a $ 4.5 million grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation.
The academy started the program last year, issuing grants ranging from $ 50,000 to $ 100,000 to poets representing states, cities and other regions. It was created in response to the growing number of poets laureate in the United States, said Jennifer Benka, the academy's president and executive director. But, she added, "almost all of these positions are not funded or are funded very modestly, while the poets serving in these roles are doing a lot of work."
In an interview this week, Elizabeth Alexander, the Mellon Foundation's president and also a poet, said the grant would help the academy expand the program.
"I have so much faith in the leadership of the Academy of American Poets, in the whole concept of the poets laureate project, and in what I think is poetry's underrecognized ability to communicate with outsized power," she said.
The first 13 poets were announced in April, selected for their literary merit and contributions to public life. Claudia Castro Luna, the poet laureate for Washington State, is spending her year as a fellow conducting poetry readings along the Columbia River in partnership with other writers and local organizations. Their aim is to highlight the waterway's status as a vital natural resource and its significance to the area's indigenous peoples.
Molly Fisk, another 2019 recipient, has funded 22 poets through the California Poets in the Schools program to lead workshops that encourage students to write poems in response to the state's recent wildfires. Ms. Fisk is the poet laureate of Nevada County, Calif., which is just 70 miles from Paradise, a town that was decimated by the Camp Fire in 2018.
The Mellon Foundation contributed a $ 2.2 million grant last year for the laureate program and returned this year to bolster its reach.
"I think there's something that's special and important about doing this big enough that it can be in so many different American communities simultaneously," Alexander said. "The ability to get a kind of textured map of the whole country is something that's very exciting."
In April, which is National Poetry Month, 10 to 20 new fellows will be named.
Public service is just one component of what a poet laureate does. The academy's fellowships are also designed to encourage their creative output.
"One thing I can promise you," Alexander said, "is that there will be at least some poems made in the next few years, under the aegis of this work, that will stand the test of time."

Texto completo: The Chiefs mounted their third double-digit comeback of the postseason, overwhelming the 49ers and ending a 50-year championship drought.
MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. -- The Kansas City Chiefs stormed back for a ridiculous 31-20 win over the San Francisco 49ers in the Super Bowl, reeling off three touchdowns in just over five minutes to overwhelm one of the N.F.L.'s most dominant defenses. The win snapped a 50-year championship drought for the Chiefs, while handing San Francisco its second Super Bowl loss since the team last won one following the 1994 season.
Here's what we learned from the game:
Andy Reid had to give up a title to get a title. The Chiefs head coach entered Sunday as the winningest coach in N.F.L. history to have never won a Super Bowl. With his 222nd win (including the postseason), he officially passed off that title, giving it back to Marty Schottenheimer, whose 205 wins came largely with the Chiefs.
Age is just a number. Patrick Mahomes was the youngest player to win the N.F.L.'s Most Valuable Player Award when he took it home last season at 23. He is the youngest quarterback to be named Super Bowl M.V.P., winning it at 24. He does not have many more major awards to win, so he will have to set his sights on being the N.F.L.'s youngest Man of the Year, or its youngest Hall of Famer.
If the Chiefs are losing, they are probably winning. Kansas City must have thought winning during the regular season was too easy, because the team turned the difficulty way up in the postseason, reeling off three consecutive victories in which it got down by at least 10 points -- setting an N.F.L. record for postseason comebacks. The Chiefs trailed the Houston Texans by 24 points in the divisional round, the Tennessee Titans by 10 points in the A.F.C. championship game, and were down 10 points to San Francisco with less than seven minutes left in the fourth quarter. "We're something special," said wide receiver Tyreek Hill.
Speed kills (eventually). The 49ers defense had limited the Chiefs offense to mostly a series of dinks and dunks, which appeared to have Kansas City on its heels for a third-and-15 play with 7:13 left in the game. Mahomes stayed cool in the pocket despite pressure by DeForest Buckner, as Hill raced his way into an open area. Mahomes could hit him for a game-changing 44-yard reception. According to the N.F.L.'s NextGen Stats, the pass traveled 57.1 yards in the air, which was Mahomes's longest completion by air yardage this season.
Kyle Shanahan does not like fourth quarters. Shanahan, the 49ers coach, talked all week about the "scars" he had from the Super Bowl following the 2016 season. He was an offensive coordinator when his Atlanta Falcons blew a 28-3 fourth-quarter lead to the New England Patriots. Shanahan watched yet another transcendent quarterback deliver a career-defining performance as his own offense fell apart. He was asked if he had felt comfortable when his team led by 20-10. "No," he said. "You never feel good until the game is over."
Deebo Samuel picked the wrong day to set a record. The 49ers rookie set a record for wide receivers with 53 yards rushing in a Super Bowl, topping the previous mark of 45 by Percy Harvin of the Seattle Seahawks set in the Super Bowl following the 2014 season. Samuel, Raheem Mostert and Tevin Coleman helped San Francisco generate 6.4 yards a carry, which was a huge part of the lead, but they were a non-factor on the team's final four drives, which resulted in a combined total of 49 yards with two punts, a turnover on downs and an interception.
Damien Williams picked a great day to shine. The Chiefs running back was largely written off in the buildup to the game. Mahomes led the team in rushing in both of Kansas City's playoff wins and the Chiefs preferred to pass. For much of this game, Williams was the only thing working for Kansas City. He finished with a team-leading 133 yards from scrimmage, putting the Chiefs ahead with a 5-yard touchdown reception and sealing the victory with a 38-yard touchdown run.

They Said It
"I had two goals when I became the starting quarterback of the Kansas City Chiefs, and the first goal was to win the Lamar Hunt trophy. I wanted to bring it home, the one that has our founder's name on it. I wanted to bring it to this family and this organization. And the second most important thing was to get Coach Reid a Super Bowl trophy." -- Patrick Mahomes, Chiefs quarterback
"I hate losing. I hate losing, period. It's going to sting for a while, but I'm going to have to put it behind me and get ready for next year." -- Kwon Alexander, 49ers linebacker
"We're like Golden State in their prime, baby. We do what it do. Sack Nation." -- Chris Jones, Chiefs defensive tackle, comparing his team's defensive line to the Stephen Curry-led Warriors
"We'll lick our wounds and we'll get over this. We'll be fired up for next year." -- Coach Kyle Shanahan, 49ers

Texto completo: The 2020-21 Great Performers series includes visiting orchestras, chamber ensembles and recitals.
Esa-Pekka Salonen will lead a concert version of Strauss's "Elektra." Franz Welser-Möst will conduct the Cleveland Orchestra in Mozart and Morton Feldman. Louis Langrée and the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra will give the first New York performance of Christopher Rouse's Symphony No. 6, which they premiered last year, shortly after its composer's death.
A slew of visiting orchestras and the Rouse symphony -- which Joshua Barone described in The New York Times as a "haunting and profound farewell" -- are among the highlights of next season's Great Performers series at Lincoln Center.
The 2020-21 series, which was announced on Thursday, will also feature a variety of smaller ensembles, chamber music concerts and more intimate recitals. There will be several free concerts in the center's David Rubenstein Atrium, including the pianist Francesco Tristano playing Bach's "Goldberg" Variations alongside projections of a digital city being drawn in real time.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
The dauntless soprano Barbara Hannigan will star alongside the pianists Katia and Marielle Labèque in the New York premiere of "Supernova," a staged exploration of nine centuries of song, directed by Netia Jones and featuring music by Hildegard von Bingen, Barbara Strozzi, Francesca Caccini, David Chalmin and Bryce Dessner.
A hearty helping of period-instrument ensembles includes Philippe Herreweghe and the Collegium Vocale Gent, performing Bach's B-minor Mass; William Christie and Les Arts Florissants, in a pair of Haydn's Paris symphonies and, with Kristian Bezuidenhout at the fortepiano, Mozart's Concerto No. 18; and Masaaki Suzuki and the Bach Collegium Japan, in works by Bach as well as Mozart's Mass in C minor.
Recitalists include the pianist Paul Lewis; Julia Fischer, playing Bach's complete works for solo violin; the pianist Piotr Anderszewski, in selections from the second volume of Bach's "Well-Tempered Clavier"; the bel canto tenor Lawrence Brownlee, singing a selection of songs that inspired him when he was young; the virtuoso pianists Garrick Ohlsson and Kirill Gerstein, in a dual concert; and the avant-garde cellist Jay Campbell.
Opening the Great Performers season on Oct. 4, Mr. Welser-Möst and the Clevelanders will juxtapose Mozart's Requiem and Feldman's "Rothko Chapel." Mr. Salonen, in his final season as principal conductor of the Philharmonia Orchestra, will lead two concerts: One of Brahms and Sibelius, and then the performance of Strauss's "Elektra," starring Iréne Theorin in the title role and the rising star Lise Davidsen, singing Chrysothemis for the first time.
Simon Rattle will conduct the London Symphony Orchestra in a pair of concerts, one featuring Mahler's Symphony No. 6 and the other an immersion in Stravinsky ballet scores: "The Firebird," "Petrushka" and "The Rite of Spring."

Consider the Consequences of Trading Your Health Data

Texto completo: Consider the Consequences of Trading Your Health Data After I signed up for my insurance plan, I got an email with a link to a "wellness program" that, if I traded some health data -- such as steps from a pedometer or smartwatch exercise data -- could earn me a small monthly payout and some gift cards. But the second I logged in, I felt paranoid about the whole thing. If you work for a company with employer-sponsored health insurance, there's a chance you've come across wellness programs such as UnitedHealthcare Motion, Humana Go365, Attain by Aetna, and Vitality (The New York Times offers Vitality to some of its employees). Each program works similarly, offering discounts or financial incentives in exchange for reaching goals, usually verified by requesting health data collected by a phone or fitness tracker. Insurance companies offer these programs to encourage people to begin or maintain healthy habits, like eating well and exercising, thus reducing health care costs. Employers offer them as financial rewards you can use toward the cost of insurance or gift cards. Financial rewards and gift cards are tantalizing incentives, but you shouldn't make the choice to trade away your health data without considering the potential issues first. Privacy Policy The laws surrounding health data are complex, and your program may not provide the data privacy you expect. The health information you share with insurance companies, H.M.O.s, health care providers, or company health plans is protected by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), which helps keep your data private. But not all workplace wellness programs are covered by HIPAA. If a program or wearable tracking device is covered by HIPAA, your employer will never have access to the data collected, but if HIPAA doesn't apply, you're trusting those entities to not share the data with your employer, third-party ad agencies, or anyone else. Without HIPAA, a wellness program (or, more accurately, the operator or administrator behind it) may sell the health information it collects, which could put you at risk of having your data used against you or unlawfully in some way. Pam Dixon, executive director of the World Privacy Forum, told me, "The best thing to do is take a close look at the privacy policy for that program. If it is a HIPAA-covered program, they're going to have something called a Notice of Privacy Practices." Look for phrases like "your rights under HIPAA," "Notice of Privacy Practices," or "NPP" in the privacy policy. "If you see the term 'we are HIPAAcompliant,' the basic rule of thumb is the program does not fall under HIPAA," Ms. Dixon added. Yes, it's confusing -- although a program may call itself compliant, that doesn't mean it's regulated, she said. If it's not covered by HIPAA, that opens the door for any data you provide to potentially be shared with third parties for advertising and marketing purposes. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services also adds this distinction: If a wellness program is offered as part of a group health plan, your information is protected by HIPAA rules; if the wellness program is offered directly by an employer, the information is not protected. When I asked Anna Slomovic, Ph.D., a data management and policy consultant, about this, she told me, "You have to remember when data is shared between organizations, what is happening is the data is copied and the copy is handed over. So one copy may be covered by HIPAA and the other copy may not be." This could include data from the devices you track activity with, like a Fitbit, where the data is covered only by Fitbit's privacy policy -- unless it gets moved over to a HIPAA-covered entity or someone acting on its behalf. Sharing Information Health data is some of the most private data you have, so it's worth being mindful of where that information is shared and how it could be used. You may not have an issue sharing the number of steps you take on your pedometer, but consider what other data your fitness tracker might gather. Referencing a chapter from the 2017 book, "Under Observation: The Interplay Between eHealth and Surveillance," Dr. Slomovic showed how much data wearable devices, apps and health portals collected. Even in 2014, this information ranged from location history to the modes of transport wearers tend to use. As to how your health data could be used, we can all imagine the worst-case scenarios of sharing information about our eating, dieting and exercising habits (or lack thereof) with insurance companies, but it's what we haven't thought of yet that's more worrisome. "You don't think this data means anything, and then all the sudden somebody else takes the data and rearranges it, and all of a sudden it's a big deal," Dr. Slomovic said. We've already seen some surprising ways that fitness data can be repurposed, like when Nathan Ruser, a student at Australian National University, used data from the fitness app Strava to reveal the locations of military bases. Many wellness programs ask you to complete surveys and risk assessments to earn points. These surveys may also ask questions you're not comfortable answering, like whether you plan to get pregnant in the next year or two. There's not much to gain from sharing this type of information, and you should avoid doing so -- you don't have to answer every question. If your family is covered by your health plan, it's important to consider their privacy as well, especially your children. Make sure your children don't fill out any health surveys that aren't covered by HIPAA, and watch out for programs that overreach for their data (and your partner's, too). Even if you trust all these companies to never share your information, don't forget about data breaches. In a paper published in the Annals of Internal Medicine, researchers found that 71 percent of 1,461 reported data breaches at hospitals between October 2009 and July 2019 included sensitive information, such as patient names, addresses, email addresses or other personal identifiers. These breaches exposed millions of people to the risk of identity theft or financial fraud. Cost of Participating Wellness programs are often marketed as a way for you to earn money, but you can also view your participation as a cost. Still, the financial benefits are hard to ignore. Though it's important to consider the potential issues, participating in a wellness program is not universally bad. Aside from considering HIPAA coverage, it's best to steer clear of programs that ask for more information than you're comfortable sharing (like genetic test results) or that pay based on specific outcomes, like weight loss. Beyond that, Dr. Slomovic suggested considering two questions: Do you have a choice in the first place, whether you can afford to not be in these programs, both financially and in terms of being seen as a team player? And if you can afford to choose, do you care what's going to happen to that data? If you don't like the potential that your data could be used in ways you don't like, you should avoid these programs. If you're still undecided, Ms. Dixon recommended using what she calls the "five analysis" to decide whether a program is worth it for you: "How does it impact you five days from now, five months from now, and five years from now?" Even if you're comfortable assuming data security risks -- and you consider yourself "healthy" -- there's always the possibility that your health status could change during the course of your participation in any wellness program.

Texto completo: Caucusgoers, uniquely, will declare their loyalty before their friends and neighbors. And they are taking their responsibility very seriously.
CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa -- It is a public display of civic duty unique in American politics: Iowans on Monday night will stand in front of their neighbors and express their preference for a candidate for president. No curtains covering a voting machine. No private paper ballots. Just a declaration of loyalty before fellow Democrats.
The Iowa caucuses are at once both quaint and globally significant, with a singular power to elevate, or deflate, candidacies. But for all of their idiosyncrasies, perhaps their most distinctive element is the sheer transparency they provide to the selection process.
At a time of such political polarization, underpinned by anxiety among Iowa Democrats that they will elevate a nominee unable to defeat President Trump, the public nature of the caucuses has amplified the stakes. In interviews with scores of Iowans over the last three months, many expressed ambivalence about making a choice, desperately trying to assess what kind of candidate others might want to elect. Many appeared wary of picking sides, and risking fragmentation, at the expense of presenting a united front; they vowed to support the eventual nominee no matter what.
Some caucusgoers said, tellingly, that they were eager to knock doors for candidates they supported but preferred to do so in nearby towns or counties lest they alienate their neighbors.
"The idea is that the caucuses are this very romantic Jeffersonian thing, with neighbors gathering in small groups to discuss ideas and candidates, and help choose leadership that will organize volunteers and lead us to electoral victory," said Nathan Thompson, the Democratic chairman in Winneshiek County. "Well, in reality, it can be a very frustrating and divisive thing for all of these volunteers and attendees."
It is another complicating factor in a race full of them.
Even elected officials are trying to divine the best approach. Rob Sand, the state auditor and a rising star in the Democratic Party, said he planned to caucus for "uncommitted," a category for those who do not want to align themselves with a candidate. Or he may not caucus at all.
"Ultimately, many of us will have a nominee who was not our first choice -- we are going to have to put that aside and do our duty to help that nominee win," Mr. Sand said. "So, I'm planning to set aside my own ability to make a choice to be a voice for unity."
As the caucuses loom, Iowa Democrats are preparing to make what may be their most significant decision ever, one that could set the party on a path to ousting Mr. Trump from the White House or divide it further. And rarely has the outcome of the caucuses been so difficult to predict or so highly anticipated.
"Anything can happen here," said David Axelrod, a former top adviser to President Barack Obama. "There's growing clarity -- but there's not a lot of clarity."
Adding to the sense of uncertainty, both the progressive and moderate wings of the party have taken turns asserting their dominance. All four of the leading candidates -- Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., and Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., -- have led polls here in recent months. Another challenger, Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, has edged closer but not yet close enough.
Most recently, Mr. Sanders has appeared to open up a lead in Iowa, consolidating liberal backing as more moderate candidates in the race continue to split their support. A nascent attempt by moderate Democrats at thwarting his rise before it is too late has shown signs of backfiring. Mr. Sanders's campaign raised more than $ 1 million off a negative ad last week that targeted him by name.
Iowa is already on tenterhooks. For months, it has defended itself against criticism that it is too white, its caucuses too exclusionary, to have the privilege of being the first state in the nominating process. Candidates have questioned the state's leadoff position in the calendar. Across the state, Iowans are wary that the absence of a clean victory could muddle the choice for Democrats in other states and undermine Iowa's claim to serving as a springboard to the nomination.
"I do think the Iowa caucuses might come to an end, especially if the results are indecisive," said John Grennan, the Democratic chairman in Poweshiek County. "2016 was very messy. 2020 could be, too."
Yet the race's prevailing uncertainty has not stopped strategists, campaign aides and caucusgoers from prognosticating that has grown more frenetic as the Iowa contest approaches. It is a parlor game that has been rendered even more difficult by a complex new set of caucus rules.
For the first time, the Iowa Democratic Party will report, on a rolling basis, three numbers on caucus night -- a delegate count and the amount of support on both the first and second rounds, known as alignments -- leaving open the possibility that more than one candidate could claim victory.
What if Mr. Sanders receives the most support on the first alignment but another candidate wins on the delegate count? What if the top candidates are clustered together, separated by only a few percentage points? Such inconclusive results would make it difficult for any candidate to ride unrivaled momentum into New Hampshire one week later. And should voters remain as undecided in New Hampshire as in Iowa, Democrats could be staring at an extended primary fight that could leave everyone bruised.
For Democrats hoping for a clearer picture after Monday's caucuses, it could lead to more hand-wringing and division. Candidates have already begun attacking their rivals in a bid for dominance.
Some campaigns have provided clues as to how they will assess the results on caucus night. Senior advisers to Mr. Sanders have indicated the Sanders campaign will declare victory if Mr. Sanders gets the most support on the first alignment. Aides to Mr. Buttigieg, on the other hand, are focusing on the delegate count. The Iowa Democratic Party and other party officials have encouraged the news media to report the delegate count, as has traditionally been done.
With so many undecided caucusgoers, the results could come down to how well organized campaigns are, particularly at the precinct level, where the final persuading will take place. Some campaigns have put in place precinct teams to persuade and wrangle caucusgoers before and after the first alignment. Precinct captains will be in touch constantly with their campaign headquarters for directives on their strategy inside the room.
Among caucusgoers, the persistent discussion of statewide political angst has only produced more angst. The degree of uncertainty, lingering even at this final stage of the precaucus season, has confounded some Democratic officials.
"Most people are undecided, and not only are they undecided but they're considering staying undecided on caucus night," said Judy Downs, the executive director of the Polk County Democrats. "Considering the sheer number of candidates and length of the campaign season, I didn't think we would be in this position so close."

Texto completo: Jennifer Lopez and Shakira had social media buzzing Sunday night.
During Sunday's Pepsi Super Bowl LIV halftime show in Miami Gardens, Florida, the two stars delivered a set complete with pole-dancing, a children's choir and a meme-able tongue moment.
Online, the performance sparked debate: Was it empowering to watch two women of color over 40 performing in a provocative way? Or had we reverted back to a pre-#MeToo moment of objectifying women?
"The @SuperBowl halftime show was just a bad strip show," tweeted @AUBeard. "We have had so much positive discussion about not treating women like sexual objects, then they go & do this. You can’t cry that women need to be treated better then support this display of sexual objectifying"
"I’m no prude, but watching it with my 7yo daughter and 11yo son was really uncomfortable," @JLMezz wrote.
User @kevindelong added: "I am embarrassed for my kids to watch this halftime show. . . what the hell," he wrote. "Stripper poles, crotch, and rear end shots. . . . no dignity. #SuperBowl #HalftimeShow shame on you Jennifer Lopez & Shakira"
Others, like @catherineshakes, argued it was "OK for grown women to be sexual and fabulous. "
"pole dancing is HARD and takes IMMENSE AMOUNTS OF STRENGTH," added @brittneyzivcsak. "it’s empowering and honestly something i admired from JLO tonight. "
"Jennifer Lopez showing off that Hustlers pole dance training, letting the Academy know that they done messed up," wrote user @dory_jackson.
The dance-heavy show earned praise from many, including former halftime headliner Lady Gaga.
". @JLo and @shakira and all the special guests were so incredible!!!" wrote the singer, who performed during the 2017 Super Bowl. "I danced and smiled the whole time. Such powerful sexy women!!!! On camera and off!!!!! Love you beautiful sexy talented women"
Opinion: JLo and Shakira's Super Bowl halftime performance was empowering, not objectifying. Here's why.
Opinion: Super Bowl halftime show should have come with a parental warning
Critics react to the halftime show
Critics concurred: The New York Times' Jon Pareles dubbed Shakira and Lopez "Latina superwomen" and the show as a whole "euphoria with a purpose. "
USA TODAY's Patrick Ryan called it "one of the best Super Bowl halftime shows in memory," especially stacked up against last year's "dreadfully forgettable" performance by Maroon 5.
"The women wrapped the performance by dancing and embracing each other, capping one of the best, most empowering and flat-out fun Super Bowl halftimes of the past decade," he wrote.
A headline for Vox declared "For 15 Minutes, Shakira and Jennifer Lopez United the Masses Better Than Anyone Could. " Craig Jenkins noted "Super Bowl halftime performances can be, and often are, quite bad," but this year's rose to the top with a mix of fun performances and pointed political statements.
"A stage full of bright, gifted women, men, and children of color was a more emboldening sight than anything PR teams trying to buy their attention could muster," he added. "It was a weird night, but it was a good halftime show. "
Jennifer Lopez and Shakira dazzle in one of the best Super Bowl halftime shows in memory
Celebrities, fans sing praises for JLo and Shakira
Kim Kardashian also praised Shakira and Lopez's performances . .
"They really shut it down!!!!" she wrote. "Congrats on that amazing SuperBowl Halftime Show"
"Bachelorette" contestant Tyler Cameron also shared his excitement, writing, "JLo and Shakira have me sweating. "
One moment in particular that caught the attention of social media was when Shakira, after crowd-surfing to her hit "Hips Don't Lie," turned to the camera and flashed her tongue while letting out a high-pitched tone.
As soon as the moment aired, memes started rolling in.
"Shakira and JLo laughing in the face of ageism in America during the #SuperBowlLIV halftime show," wrote user @Lili_Rebel, along with a video of the moment. "Take that haters. "
"Harry Potter whenever he sees a snake and starts speaking parseltongue," wrote @entrelada_ along with the clip.
User @luluramadan saw the moment as a nod to an "Arab tradition. "
"Chiming in because I know everyone will be making jokes about this for days — this is a popular Arab tradition, called zaghrouta, used to express joy at celebrations," she wrote. "In the melting pot that is Miami, you could not have picked a better Super Bowl act and this was a lovely touch. "
At the beginning of the song "Let's Get Loud," which featured a children's chorus, the camera panned to show kids sitting under lighted arches.
User @tom_moore_104 saw this moment as a "necessary statement" about children detained at the border.
"Props to Jlo, Shakira and/or the choreographer for the necessary statement with Latino children in cages," he wrote, along with a picture of the staging.
Lopez's 11-year-old daughter Emme Maribel Muñiz also took the stage to sing, showing strong vocals run in the family.
"Why JLo daughter Emme sound better than her?!?" wrote user @nicole_perez1.
User @Roxana1912 said, "the Latina girl in me felt very empowered and represented" by the show.
"During this #pepsihalftimeshow I felt the urge of going upstairs and waking up my half-Peruvian daughters so they could see the Latin power that runs through their veins," she wrote.
User @chelleinla commended the Super Bowl for showing two "Latina women CRUSHING the halftime show in 2020. "
"This is my America," she added.

For the eventual Democratic nominee, Iowa may prove to be a tough target

Texto completo: DES MOINES " In a packed arena here last week, President Trump focused on home-state issues, mentioning farmers 47 times, touting recent trade deals and taking credit for Iowa's low unemployment rate.
Trump won Iowa decisively in 2016, and while Democrats made gains two years later, the party's presidential candidates " after hundreds of rallies, town halls and parties over the past year " now face a decision: whether to bother coming back.
'I worked so hard for this state. I worked so hard,' Trump said as he opened his rally. He added: 'We're going to win the great state of Iowa, and it's going to be a historic landslide. If we don't win, your farms are going to hell.'
Iowa has long been competitive, but Trump's nine-point victory and the state's demographic makeup place it at the heart of a central question facing Democrats: Can they win back rural, white and industrial voters, or is the party's future elsewhere?
'How did Donald Trump win your state " a purple swing state " by almost 10 points?' Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang said at a Des Moines rally Saturday. 'Why is it that this state has gone from blue or purple to red over the last number of years? That's a fundamental question, and the Democrats have not been addressing it.'
Some Democrats insist that Trump is vulnerable in Iowa, highlighting his flagging approval numbers and the 2018 midterm elections, when Democratic candidates performed well in areas that Trump had previously won.
Former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg in particular has argued that he can capital ize on those areas. Iowa is home to more counties that flipped from Obama to Trump than any other state, and Buttigieg has boasted of touring 25 of those 31 counties.
'The president is going to be in big trouble here,' said Matt Sinovic, executive director of the liberal group Progress Iowa. 'His approval numbers are down, and every other underlying factor is what points to that.'
But it's no accident that Trump chose to hold a rally in Iowa " before a capacity crowd at Drake University's Knapp Center " just days before the Democrats in this state began the process of choosing his opponent. Trump's strength in rural counties propelled his victory in Iowa, which saw the largest swing away from Democrats among the six states that flipped from President Barack Obama to Trump between 2012 and 2016.
Some Democrats' complaints about Iowa's first-in-the-nation role reflect a broader concern that its demographic profile is out of step with an increasingly diverse Democratic Party that performs best in areas with a larger share of minority voters. More than 90-percent of the population in Iowa is white.
Jim Messina, who served as Obama's 2012 campaign manager, said Trump and Republicans were 'heavy favorites to win in the general election' in Iowa.
While Democrats' chances in Iowa ultimately depend on which candidate they nominate, Messina said, the election is likely to be won or lost in other states. Iowa, he said, is 'clearly below the mid-tier of Midwestern states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.'
Iowa's recent drift is epitomized by Sen. Joni Ernst, a conservative Republican who won her seat after the 2014 retirement of Sen. Tom Harkin (D), a longtime liberal icon. Ernst caught fire that year with an ad declaring: 'I grew up castrating hogs on an Iowa farm, so when I get to Washington, I'll know how to cut pork.'
But amid a Democratic surge in 2018, Democrats retook two of Iowa's four U.S. House seats, flipping a 3-to-1 GOP edge to a 3-to-1-Democratic advantage. But both senators and the governor are Republican, and it's not clear if 2018 is a blip or a long-term trend.
For now, Trump's approval rating is underwater in Iowa, with 53-percent of voters disapproving of his performance and 44 percent approving, according to a poll released in December by Morning Consult. A January poll released by the Des Moines Register in coordination with CNN and Mediacom found that only 34 percent of Iowans said they would 'definitely' vote to reelect Trump.
Democrats say issues such as Trump's efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act have badly damaged his standing in the state. At his rally, Trump spent little time on health care, instead arguing that he has helped drive down the state's unemployment rate, which has been below 3 percent since October 2017, and touting his trade deals.
He also cited a New York Times-Siena College poll that showed him beating his Democratic presidential rivals, whom he characterized as radical left-wingers. 'They have me pitted against every one of the socialists, and we're winning by a lot,' Trump said, exaggerating the narrow lead he holds against most Democrats in the poll, some of which fall within the margin of error.
Trump took particular aim at Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who describes himself as a democratic socialist. 'Under three years of my administration, net farm income has already gone up nearly 50 percent and will now be rising even faster,' Trump told the crowd. 'What are you going to do? You are going to vote for Bernie? You are going to vote for Bernie?'
Still, Trump's trade war has clearly had a residual effect on the state's farmers. Ernst, speaking on CNN's 'State of the Union' on Sunday, said that while farmers were experiencing 'hurt' during the trade war, they continue to support Trump.
'What I heard from one farmer, she said, 'You know what? I'm tightening my belt. Things are tougher right now, but I know in the long run this is going to be better for my grandchildren,' ' Ernst said.
And Trump's support among the state's Republicans has remained strong. According to a Des Moines Register-CNN-Mediacom poll released in November, 85 percent of Republicans approve of Trump's job performance. The president's campaign dispatched more than 80 surrogates to Iowa ahead of the caucuses as a show of force aimed at shoring up that support.
State Sen. Tom Greene (R), one of those surrogates, predicted that the president will win easily in November. Trump 'carried the 93-of 99 countries in Iowa and carried the state by 190,000 votes in 2016,' he said. 'I expect similar results in 2020.'
Kayleigh McEnany, a spokeswoman for Trump's campaign, said the surrogates would be speaking at the Republican caucuses, where Trump does not face serious competition, to get ready for the effort in November.
'This is an opportunity to work out those ground-game muscles and make sure we have our ducks in a row,' she said. 'We're not ever going to take a state for granted.'
Aside from Florida and Ohio, Iowa is the only state that has flipped between parties three times since 2000. After going for Republican George W. Bush in 2004, it voted twice for Obama before turning to Trump.
In 2016, Trump visited Iowa seven times in the final three months of the election compared with three for Democrat Hillary Clinton, an investment that appeared to pay off.
Sinovic said this time would be different now that voters have seen how Trump handles bread-and-butter issues such as health care.
'Americans and Iowans are furious about them trying to take away our health care,' Sinovic said. 'That has been the number one issue when it comes to these national elections these last couple years, and it's going to continue to be.'

Texto completo: They're closing up the office now, with its musty odor of moldering newsprint and decrepit bound copies stacked neck-high. On Thursday, the last Montgomery Sentinel rolled off a press, 165 years after its birth.
The newspaper once carried ads for slaves and chronicled the news from both the Civil War and the civil rights movement. It survived the Great Depression and muddled through the Great Recession. But the paper, with editions serving Maryland's two largest counties, Montgomery and Prince George's, couldn't survive Facebook and Google and Instagram. And so now it is gone, the latest to fall in America's vast newspaper famine.
The story has become humdrum, so routine that newspapers barely stir themselves to report on all the deaths in their family. The civic commemorations are brief, too, if they happen at all. The numbers are dry: More than 1 in 5 newspapers, mostly weeklies like the Sentinel, have dropped dead over the past 15 years.
Like all those papers, the Sentinel covered the local stuff, news of the community, just over the border from the nation's capital. It wrote about county government ('Bike registration, stipends and zoning dominate meeting,' read last week's headline), and once staffed all the other meaty beats: schools, politics, cops, courts.
The politicians and bureaucrats knew someone was watching " accountability journalism. Does Facebook do anything like that?
It wrote about people " the teachers, doctors, librarians and artists who lived down the street. When those people died, the obituaries helped everyone remember. Does Instagram do obits?
When someone's kid scored the winning basket, the Sentinels in Montgomery and Prince George's had a big write-up, with a picture that mom and dad could clip and savor forever. When the school water fountains had lead in them, or the buses had safety issues, the papers wrote that up, too. And when a boy from Damascus or Cheverly or Upper Marlboro died serving his country, his sacrifice was memorialized in the paper.
The Sentinels starved to death for all the usual reasons, said their publisher, Lynn Kapiloff. Once-bounteous display ads from local merchants " the kind from pizza joints and car dealers " began drifting away to the Google-Facebook duopoly a decade or so ago. Help-wanted ads were vaporized by Craigslist and others offering an unbeatable price (free!). The only thing left was legal ads, and those didn't cover the cost of the staff and all the stringers.
Readers wandered, too. The Montgomery and Prince George's papers had a circulation of around 200,000 in the 1990s. The last edition will be distributed to about 5,000 readers in each county, said Kapiloff, whose family has owned the papers for 57 years.
'I don't know how to carry on at this point,' she said. 'I don't know where the advertising would come from.' Kapiloff, who is 81, knows it takes money, energy and vision to keep a paper alive in a minute-to-minute news cycle. (A son, Mark, is considering reviving the title online.)
'The whole thing makes me so sad,' she said. 'I don't know what the answer is.'
The Sentinels' path to the graveyard is well-trod. The Montgomery Journal went under in 2005. The Washington Post closed its weekly Montgomery and Prince George's 'Extra' sections in 2009. The Montgomery and Prince George's Gazette newspapers disappeared in 2015 after Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos failed to find a buyer for them.
A question hovers: If Montgomery and Prince George's counties can't sustain their own local papers, what county can?
Montgomery, with just over a million people, is one of the most affluent and well-educated jurisdictions in the country. It's home to the National Institutes of Health, the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, a symphonic concert venue and a collection of biotech firms. Prince George's is the state's second-largest county (pop. 921,000), and also prosperous.
Two counties, nearly 2-million people. And nowadays, just a handful of full-time reporters to cover them.
'It's a sad day,' said Brian Karem, who was the Sentinels' editor for eight years, until 2018. 'People want community news, they need it, but I don't think we've got a handle on how to make it profitable.'
Karem, who made headlines last year when his press credentials were yanked by the White House, is among a number of well-known journalists who've worked at the Sentinels. The list includes the late Robert Pear, of the New York Times; Tom Shales, The Post's former TV critic, and Knight Kiplinger, who oversaw a financial news company. Another alum: Danica Roem, the first openly transgender person to be elected to Virginia's legislature.
The Montgomery Sentinel's most famous reporter is Bob Woodward, who may be the most famous reporter in America, period. Woodward tried to get a job at The Washington Post when he got out of the Navy in 1970, but the paper rejected him after a two-week tryout. Fortunately for him, an editor, Harry Rosenfeld, saw something in Woodward and recommended him to Roger Farquhar, then the Sentinel's editor.
Woodward spent a year in the Sentinel's Rockville newsroom (co-located with the late owner Bernard Kapiloff's dental office) learning how to be an investigative reporter. He turned out to be pretty good at it. Among his first pieces was a bombshell about the state's attorney general, Francis Burch, who was directing state business (and lots of fees) to his private law firm.
Burch didn't like the story one bit, and drove from Baltimore to the Sentinel's office to chew out Farquhar.
'I remember thinking, 'This is the end of journalism for me,' ' recalled Woodward the other day. But after Burch stormed out of the office, Farquhar sidled over to Woodward's desk. 'He said, 'The attorney general's upset,' ' Woodward recalled. 'And then he smiled.'
The Post took Woodward back in 1971. The next year, he and another Metro reporter, Carl Bernstein, began covering a break-in at the Watergate complex.
Woodward's brief tenure at the Sentinel tells another story. Little papers were once part of the farm system for larger papers; greenhorns learned how to read a police blotter before stepping up to the next rung on the media ladder. Almost every accomplished journalist has a when-I-was-starting-out story that begins at a small paper like the Sentinel.
With the ecosystem so damaged and disrupted, where does the next Woodward come from?
Restaurants and shoe stores come and go, churned in capitalism's tide. But the tide moves only in one direction for newspapers. They disappear, taking their words and photos and moldering memories with them.
When they die, a bit of a community does, too.

Texto completo: Speaking to U.S. senators last week, a member of President Trump's impeachment-defense team assailed the idea of impeachment.

Kenneth Starr complained about this age of impeachment, when the impeachment habit proved hard to kick and advocated a return to norms when impeachments were extremely rare.

A constitutional amendment may indeed be needed, but not the one Mr. Starr appears to be pitching.

Is Starr arguing that we need to change the Constitution and get rid of the very idea of impeachment? 'Creative' way to get things started, Michael McFaul, a former U.S. ambassador to Russia, responded on Twitter.

Mr. McFaul has a point.

With impeachment worries all but behind him, President Trump is free to continue soliciting or even extorting foreign help in the upcoming election, unhindered.

As a reminder, he was impeached for extorting Ukraine to dig up dirt on his main political rival Joe Biden and trying to hide it from Congress. He has also called for Russia and China to interfere in the presidential elections.

Changing the Constitution in the United States is thankfully a vastly more difficult task, than, say, in China or Russia, which are far more accommodating to their respective dear leaders.

Indeed, Chinese President Xi Jinping made himself a president for life not so long ago (getting kudos from Mr. Trump). Another autocrat publicly admired by Mr. Trump - Russian President Vladimir Putin - is in the process of pushing through constitutional changes to make sure he stays in power once his last presidential term expires in four years.

Besides, there is simply no time for Mr. Trump and Co. to pull it off on his watch.

But now that the idea of getting rid of impeachment has been put out there and may eventually be implemented, it would be prudent to make sure the future U.S. elections are secure from foreign interference - especially if President Trump gets acquitted and doubles down on his efforts seeking election help from foreign autocrats.

The danger is his getting away with it would create a precedent for future U.S. presidents to follow.

A constitutional amendment that would list soliciting or receiving any foreign assistance in the elections by the president as high crimes and misdemeanors - alongside treason and bribery - could remedy that.

Meanwhile, the threat of foreign election interference - especially from Russia - is very real, as U.S. foreign intelligence officials and experts keep warning us. Efforts to defend against that threat, however, either fall short or get sabotaged by the Trump Administration.

The Russian hackers are back in full force and are getting more sophisticated and harder to defend against than in 2016 when they interfered on a broad scale to sway the elections in Mr. Trump's favor, according to a warning issued in October by the National Security Agency and the British security service.

Moreover, experts tracking Russian disinformation warn that the fear of hacking can be as harmful as hacking itself in the era of wide-spread mistrust.

You don't actually have to breach an election system in order to create the public impression that you have [done it], said Laura Rosenberger, director of the Alliance for Securing Democracy, as quoted by the New York Times in a Jan. 10 article.

Chaos is the point, she added according to the paper. You can imagine different scenarios.

In an ominous development, Russian constitutional changes proposed by Mr. Putin include a provision that would prioritize Russian law over international law, further freeing his hands to do as he pleases not only in Russia but on foreign soil as well.

The 2020 elections and any future elections, in other words, are sure to experience at least as much foreign meddling as those of 2016.

So while Democrats still have the House, they may want to give that legislative initiative idea a thought.

If it doesn't take, we risk ending up like the Russians, who - devoid of the division of powers, functional democratic institutions, and independent media - are watching their president dismantle their so-far democratic constitution for his own political and financial gain.

THE TALK BEFORE THE CAUCUS; Candidates making their final push; Iowa ultimately determined every Dem nominee since 2000

Texto completo: DES MOINES - Democratic presidential hopefuls have been courting voters across this midwestern state for the past year with variations on the same pitch: Pick me to lead the party and beat Donald Trump.

Come Monday, Iowa Democrats participating in the nation's first presidential nominating contest will decide whose plea has been most effective.

Their choices will shape a contest that's as much about unseating President Trump as it is about forging an identity for a Democratic Party torn between its bold reimagining and a sensible path forward.

The results in Iowa won't settle the nomina-tion, but they will begin to clarify a race without a real front-runner and set the lineup for next month's primaries in Ohio, Michigan, and Pennsylvania - battlegrounds that were key to Mr. Trump's 2016 victory in the general election. By March, the field might have an unexpected new leader, or be down an early favorite. There's also the potential for the candidates clustered at the top to continue jockeying for the nomination through spring, setting the stage for a messy delegate battle at the Democratic National Convention.

How important is Iowa given its size and small proportion of delegates? In 1972 it became the first state to vote in the Democratic presidential primary, and since 2000 all its Democratic winners have gone on to become their party's nominee. Voters here relish the outsize attention from candidates and the media for a year leading up to the caucuses, despite arguments from outsiders that it's time for an overwhelmingly white and rural state to pass the torch to one that's more diverse.

The latest Iowa polling shows Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders with an edge heading into Monday. He's trailed by former vice president Joe Biden, whose momentum appeared to peak at the outset of his candidacy. Rounding out the top are Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor from Indiana, and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who are both counting on their performances in Iowa to carry them to strong finishes in other early voting states.

In a final pitch to some 250 caucus-goers in Marshalltown, a central Iowa city still reeling from a destructive tornado that ripped through town in 2018, Mr. Buttigieg sought to set himself apart from his biggest rivals, painting Mr. Sanders as too liberal and uncompromising and Mr. Biden as too status quo.

Vice president Biden has been talking about the idea that we can't afford to take a risk on somebody new. I believe history has shown us that we can't afford to take a risk of falling back on the familiar and expecting the same Washington playbook to help us against this President, he said.

Senator Sanders ... has offered a politics that says it's all or nothing, my way or the highway, at a moment when we finally have an American majority who actually believes we can and should look to the public sector to make sure everybody has insurance. They're just not so sure about kicking people off their private plans.

At one point, each of the current top four has ridden an Iowa surge, making the outcome Monday all the more uncertain.

Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, boosted by a New York Times endorsement shared with Ms. Warren, has been a steady moderate alongside Mr. Biden and Mr. Buttigieg, and is the candidate most likely to have a surprise breakthrough in Iowa. Businessman Andrew Yang and billionaire Tom Steyer are wild cards polling in the single digits.

There's also former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg, who skipped Iowa and early voting states for delegate-rich Super Tuesday and March primary states, a strategy that might upend the carefully laid plans of other candidates banking on early wins to help clinch the nomination.

With moderates and progressives, men and women, lawmakers and businessmen, a millennial and septuagenarians all represented in the field, some caucus-goers are overwhelmed by the choices in front of them. They also feel pressured to choose the best candidate to unseat Mr. Trump, who flew into Des Moines on Thursday for a rally and used the stage to criticize his potential opponents.

We can't do another four years, said Jennifer Barloon, a 36-year-old accountant who said Mr. Trump has pushed her to caucus for the first time. She's among the 11 percent of likely caucus-goers who are undecided, according to the last Des Moines Register Iowa Poll.

I'm down to four, she's down to three. We'll make a decision on Monday night, said John Tagliareni, 49, who along with his wife attended Mr. Buttigieg's 550-person rally this week in Ankeny, Iowa, a fast-growing Des Moines suburb, where the former mayor is locking down support from older, white Iowans.

The home stretch in Iowa was thrown out of whack by President Trump's impeachment trial, but the senators sidelined in Washington for the past two weeks are making up lost ground over the weekend. They won't need to be back in Washington until Wednesday for a final vote on whether to convict Mr. Trump, who is expected to be acquitted by the GOP majority.

Last week the senators deployed surrogates to campaign in their absence. Documentary filmmaker Michael Moore stumped for Mr. Sanders along with the senator's wife, Jane Sanders.

Ms. Warren's campaign held a rally Friday in Des Moines with 700 people that featured her husband, Bruce Mann, and her golden retriever, Bailey, who was used in photos.

It's down to the wire for the candidates to sway undecided caucus-goers.

I'm at 85 percent, said Shelby Ridley, 33, who attended the Friday night Warren rally and says she's likely caucusing for the senator. I haven't paid a lot of attention until the last month because it's overwhelming and there are too many choices.

"The Witches Are Coming" is a well-timed rallying cry leading up to the next election

Texto completo: Lindy West, a New York Times columnist and the bestselling author of “Shrill,” returns with a new book of powder-keg political and activist essays “The Witches Are Coming.” The collection aims to place the #MeToo movement in context while leaving plenty of room for West’s trademark acerbic asides and millennial meanderings about the Goop Marketplace and the virtues (or lack thereof) of dresses with pockets.
The cover describes the book as “Essays From the Bestselling Author of ‘Shrill’,” while West calls them chapters. The eighteen titled sections at times defy both descriptors, favoring something closer to “notes,” the term she used for her first book. There is less scene, more exposition; less vulnerability, more swearing; less character-building, more, well, just, more. More anger, preening, intelligence and implication.
Many of her usual targets are taken aim at here, including fat-shaming, sexism and the cruelty of faceless internet trolls. But West is often most effective when she pulls the unexpected into her laser view, such as the creators of “South Park,” Adam Sandler’s movies, or Chip and Joanna Gaines of the television series “Fixer Upper.”
In “How to Be a Girl,” West takes on the board game turned movie “Clue”: “I gave ‘Clue’ a lot. My time, my love, my brain space, my video store rental fees. ‘Clue,’ in turn, gave me something back: my first inkling of myself as a woman situated somewhere on a scary, hierarchical, baffling, shifting matrix of women.”
She continues to dissect the way she considered the four main female characters in “Clue.” “I remember, as a child, looking from each of these women to the next, and trying to figure out which kind of woman I might grow up to be.” She decides that she is Mrs. Peacock. “At age 8, the closest analog I could find for myself in my favorite movie – a movie with more female characters than most – was a corrupt senator’s wife who was older than my father and dressed like a Rainforest Cafe.”
West is a funny feminist, an oxymoron she untangles in one of her strongest essays “Joan” about comic Joan Rivers. Along with the expected brilliant humor, West’s writing can also be beautiful and bewitching. Some favorite observations include “My husband plays the trumpet, which is sort of a loud pretzel originally invented to blow down the walls” or “To live in Seattle is to exist, perpetually, in the bargaining stage of grief.”
Mostly, though, West does not give in to the beauty of the line, training her eye instead on pure impact, and while the energy here is certainly palpable, at times the episodic structure of “The Witches Are Coming” makes it feel more akin to listening to a podcast. The caustic jiujitsu is still on the page, but can feel clogged by the incessant ALL CAPS, whole paragraphs of exclamation points, text talk and single-sentence paragraph conclusion zingers.
One gets the sense that this shorthand is the result of having Important Things to Say at a time when the stakes could not be higher. “I used to think of my job as digesting the news, digesting the chatter, then saying what still needed to be said – whatever hard truths people were avoiding or invisible biases they were overlooking,” she writes. West continues to employ history, logic, and her own brand of extreme truth-telling in this new collection, a well-timed rallying cry as we enter into the next election cycle.

Texto completo: Congress takes care of the wealthy. The rest must take care of ourselves. That is especially true among those growing older on a fixed income.
There are three things every senior should know.
First, enroll in Medicare Part D coverage as soon as you are eligible. Choose a standalone Part D plan or a Medicare Advantage plan with drug coverage when you first become eligible for Medicare. You may also enroll or change plans during the Medicare annual enrollment period between Oct. 15 and Dec. 7.
Click on “Medicare Supplement Insurance Part D,” enter your zip code, and be amazed at the differences in premiums and out-of-pocket costs. I had the same plan for several years figuring, “Oh, there can’t be that much difference.” I couldn’t imagine how irrational the prescription drug-pricing system could be.
In my case, I found Part D plan premiums varying between $49.20 per month and $13.80. Deductibles ranged from $100 in one plan to $435 in another.
This website measures costs of drugs you actually use. You can see how the pharmaceutical cabal runs amok. Out-of-pocket costs are wildly different from plan to plan. There is an inexplicably large difference between what individual pharmacies in the same community charge.
I would pay one popular pharmacy $149.12 per year out of pocket, but $499.64 at another pharmacy a mile away. First prescription of the new year? Old plan: $30. New plan: $0. With a click of the mouse, I reduced total out-of-pocket expenses by nearly 60%.
Second, seniors should know President Trump and his congressional allies, including Sen. John Barrasso, have their sights on slashing Social Security and Medicare. Barrasso plans to take the lead in cutting both, telling the New York Times Republicans are discussing the idea with Trump, who told them he’d like to get it done.
That’s been reported in other outlets, including the conservative Forbes.com. Forbes also speaks about Mitch McConnell’s enthusiasm for the idea. Wherever McConnell goes, Barrasso is never far behind.
Forbes describes Barrasso as optimistic, “We’ve brought it up with President Trump, who talked about it being a second-term project.” Trump confirmed as much at the 2020 World Economic Forum’s summit in Davos, openly admitting he would, if reelected in 2020, consider cutting funding for Social Security, Medicaid and Medicare.
The frontrunner to replace retiring Sen. Mike Enzi is Cynthia Lummis. As a member of the House of Representatives, she wasn’t much of a supporter of Social Security. The Alliance for Retired Americans, whose mission is “warding off cuts to Social Security and Medicare,” scored her at 2% on issues that matter to seniors, largely because she supported privatizing Social Security.
As a Senate candidate, she offers only the generalization that “Social Security must be fixed.” However, there is another clue. She has tethered herself as close as humanly possible to Trump. Where he goes, she will follow, and according to the Washington Post, Trump has already “instructed his aides to prepare sweeping budget cuts if he wins a second term in the White House.”
Republicans are in a box created by tax cuts they gifted the wealthy, disingenuously promising they would generate new revenue and reduce the national debt. We all knew better.
Trump’s Treasury Department admits that the post-tax-cut deficit rose 26% last year. As of last week, the current national debt is $23,194,094,220,717.31 and would be higher but for the Trump-tariff taxes you and I are paying. Trump, Barrasso and Enzi’s Republican replacement will be looking to slash Social Security and Medicare in order to stop the bleeding.
Older voters need to tie Cynthia down. Don’t wait until she is elected, when she’ll likely choose Trump over you. Then, confront Barrasso and Cheney while thinking twice about voting to reelect the president.
The third thing Wyoming seniors should know? Hmmm … darn, forgot what it was. Oh well, that’s how it is these days. But, whatever it was couldn’t matter as much as protecting yourself from politicians plotting to cut Social Security and Medicare.

Texto completo: Every so often a book comes along that shakes up the national gabfest in a way that makes all of us talk about an old problem with a new urgency.
Jane Jacobs' 1961 book "The Death and Life of Great American Cities" sparked a movement to preserve urban neighborhood diversity against developers' bulldozers.
Michael Harrington's 1962 "The Other America: Poverty in the United States" helped spur President Lyndon B. Johnson's "War on Poverty."
Rachel Carson's 1962 "Silent Spring" gave flight to what became the environmental preservation movement.
Now 10 years have passed since another breakthrough book shook up the criminal justice debate: legal scholar Michelle Alexander's "The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness."
Since hers was hardly the first study to claim racial bias in our nation's criminal justice system, she recalls in an essay that she wrote for the book's 10th anniversary edition, many people told her not to expect much reaction. Instead, the book climbed The New York Times bestseller list, where it remained for nearly 250 weeks.
A decade later, it is easier to look back and see what made this book stand out - and ignite another debate, even as states such as Illinois expunge thousands of minor drug convictions. With ample statistics and historical narratives, she gave voice to what many people had long suspected, especially in Black communities. The surge in Black incarceration that followed decades of wars on drugs had become, whether by accident or design, a "new Jim Crow," she argued, metaphorically resembling the original version of racial segregation banned by the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
The nation's criminal justice system uses the war on drugs to enforce forms of racial discrimination, oppression and "social control" that most of us thought had gone away with the hard-won victories of the civil rights era.
For this, she has received some scholarly pushback, even from those who share her concern for racially disproportional incarceration rates. In his book"Locked In: The True Causes of Mass Incarceration and How to Achieve Real Reform," John Pfaff, a Fordham University law professor, argues that Alexander makes too much of the statistics for drug offenders, since they make up only a small part of the prison population - and nonviolent drug offenders an even smaller part.
Most prisoners have been convicted of violent crimes, he points out, and most American prisoners are in county and state justice systems, not the federal system.
Indeed, the federal system houses 221,000 inmates, compared with 1.3 million in state prisons and 612,000 in local jails, according to the Prison Policy Initiative in 2019.
Although the proportion of state prisoners whose primary crime was a drug offense rose sharply from 1980 to 1990, when it peaked at 22%, Pfaff writes, that leaves about four-fifths who were found guilty of some other offense. By 2010, it fell to 17%. Bottom line, says the statistics expert: Reducing the incarceration of drug offenders will not do much to reduce prison populations.
Other scholars have made similar claims. Jonathan Rothwell, a Brookings Institution senior fellow, tries nobly to reconcile the differences by comparing the time and length of sentences for different crimes. Drug crimes have been the predominant reason for new admissions into state and federal prisons in recent decades, but those offenders tend to serve shorter sentences than those convicted of violent crimes.
"Rolling back the war on drugs would not totally solve the problem of mass incarceration," he writes, "but it could help a great deal, by reducing exposure to prison."
That makes sense. So do a number of Black community residents who would like to see tougher law enforcement. The get-tough approach is much less popular now. That helps to explain why former Vice President Joe Biden seemed to be caught in a time warp as he tried to defend his support of the get-tough 1994 crime law that Alexander blames for making the mass incarceration problem worse.
As some of us remember, that bill was supported by many Black folks, including the Congressional Black Caucus, although with some reservations as they called for other reforms, too.
But today, years after the totally unexpected crime drop in the mid-1990s, more people of all races are asking questions about the role race plays in our justice system. After all, crack cocaine, primarily a plague in Black communities, was treated as a crime problem. Opioid abuse, more closely identified with poor white communities, has been treated as a public health problem.
Racial disparities like that are not easily brushed off as coincidence. Nor should they be. Instead, they help to explain the popularity of Alexander's book.

Dining room becomes pop-up restaurant

Texto completo: At pop-up restaurants, where chefs temporarily set up shop in a dining room, a barn or even a dorm room, dinner is an improvisation, more jazz than symphony. For a limited time and a limited audience, a cook can riff with premeditated spontaneity.
For years, pop-ups have been many newcomers' first step toward opening a restaurant, a way to show off their talent and try out new ideas. But now, some chefs and home cooks are treating the pop-up as an end in itself, using the dinners to explore and share their culinary traditions.
This new breed of chefs charge for their dinners, but none are getting rich from them. Most advertise on Instagram and sell tickets online. Whatever the logistics, their pop-ups allow them to innovate and experiment for just a few guests, creating a community that lasts only as long as the meal. Pop-ups offer cooks a way to say, through food: "This is my history. This is who I am."
In Union City, New Jersey, LeighAnn Martin makes Trinidadian-inspired food at her home. Her pop-up is called A Table for Four.
In 2017, Martin booked a ticket to St. Lucia, in the Caribbean. A native of Trinidad, she was tired of New York winters and yearned to understand more about her ancestral foods. In a series of trips to the Caribbean ranging from a week to more than a month, she set out to explore different islands.
In Trinidad, she spoke with relatives, carefully watching them cook. In Grenada, she felt connected to the land, preparing barracuda once a week. In Barbados, she sought out dishes not meant for tourists.
"It's not like everyone is eating out of coconut shells," Martin said, laughing. "But you have to respect that Jamaicans cook like Jamaicans, and Trinidadians cook like Trinidadians. There's no 'Caribbean food.' That's a myth."
When she returned to her apartment in Union City, New Jersey, in June 2018, she started hosting intimate pop-up dinners at her small, square table. Martin, 34, plans each course months in advance, infusing rum with fruit for dessert, and meeting with the staff at Good Wine, a store in Park Slope, Brooklyn, to plan each pairing.
"I'm a crazy Virgo," she said. "I'm Miss Bossypants. With everything, it's preparation."
Her dinners pole-vault stereotypes of Caribbean food as being laid-back and slapdash. An August dinner was beach-themed, her food an ode to the oceanside socializing, with fruit sellers and soccer games, that lives in her nostalgia. For $85, including wine pairings, each of her four guests took a trip into her memories.
To start, she served a gazpacho made from chayóte, the squash also known as christophine, in open calabash gourds, nestled on beds of rock salt. She dressed the chilled soup with coconut oil from Grenada, brought back in her suitcase.
Spicy ginger shrimp evoked the heat of beach sand. The briny taste of her souse, pickled pigs' feet served in an acidic brine, recalled the salty waves. ("A lot of people within the diaspora would rather not speak about the undesirable cuts of meat," she explained. "But I want to show respect to the people of my country.")
Therese Nelson, a food historian who attended, said she admired Martin for making a Caribbean meal without the stereotypical dishes that tourists expect. "She is using our heritage in a way that explores and plays, the way that every other culture gets to," Nelson said.

NC lawmakers aim to stamp out hair-based discrimination

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - About a year ago, a New Jersey teen was forced to cut his dreadlocks in order to participate in a high school wrestling match. The wrestler, Andrew Johnson, received a hurried haircut after he was told by a referee that his hair violated wrestling rules. He won the match and state officials opened a civil rights investigation, The New York Times reported.
Now members of Congress are trying to make sure that never happens again.
North Carolina Democratic Rep. G.K. Butterfield is among the U.S. House lawmakers pushing a bill that would ban discrimination based on hair textures and styles. The bill, known as the CROWN Act, would clarify that discrimination based on race or national origin encompasses hair texture and style.
Backers say the bill - which names styles commonly associated with black people, such as dreadlocks, cornrows, twists and Bantu knots - would improve equity in education, employment, housing and other public programs. The issue is of particular concern to black women, whose hair is more likely than white women's hair to be perceived as "unprofessional," according to a 2019 study of 2,000 black and white women. It was supported by Dove, a beauty company that came under fire in 2017 for an ad that featured a black woman who took off her shirt and transformed into a white woman.
The study finds that black women are also more likely than white women to be sent home from their workplace because of their hair and more likely to report harsh judgments based on looks. Four out of five said they have to change their hair from its natural state to fit in at the office.
Another high-profile incident involves Chastity Jones, a black woman who applied for a job in 2010 as a customer service representative with Catastrophe Management Solutions, an insurance claims company in Alabama. She got the job, but the company rescinded the offer because she wouldn't comply with a request to cut her dread-locks.
The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission filed a lawsuit against CMS, but a district court ruled for the company, arguing that its grooming policy did not constitute intentional discrimination because hair styles, unlike skin color, are not an "immutable" characteristic. The Atlanta-based 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the decision in 2016.
Wendy Greene, a law professor at Drexel University, disputed the court's reasoning, calling the doctrine of immutability a "legal fiction" that is "rooted in a discredited view of race as biological and unchangeable." People classify individuals racially through various characteristics, including hairstyles and texture, she said in an interview, noting that such characteristics were used as a basis to enslave people.
Black women in particular have a "narrow way" in which they can show up at work, she said. Conforming to biases favoring straight hair can be exhausting, timely and expensive, not to mention a threat to physical and mental health.

Texto completo: CURIOUS MINNESOTA
The "Curious Minnesota" feature is a great addition to the Star Tribune. I was thrilled to see in the Jan. 26 installment that someone wanted to know why Democrats are called DFLers in Minnesota. With apologies to Heather Brown at WCCO, good question! Unfortunately, the explanation provided in last Sunday's paper completely missed the mark. The 1944 merger of the Democratic and Farmer-Labor parties was a political marriage of convenience, but the engagement began eight years earlier. In 1936, President Franklin Roosevelt was running for re-election and faced two serious challengers Republican Alf Landon and Union Party candidate William Lemke of North Dakota. Fearing that Minnesotans might be swayed by Lemke's populist appeal (thus helping Landon secure Minnesota's 11 electoral votes), Roosevelt helped orchestrate a deal that became known as the Minnesota Fusion. Here's how it worked: The Democratic nominees for governor (Fred Curtis) and the U.S. Senate (Patrick Delaney) agreed to withdraw from their races in Minnesota one month before the general election. That gave their Farmer-Labor opponents much better odds of prevailing over the Republican candidates in November, which they proceeded to do. In return, Minnesota's Farmer-Labor Party encouraged its members to back Roosevelt for a second term. Smelling a rat from halfway across the country, Arthur Krock of the New York Times wrote, "Minnesota Democrats and the President have strange bedfellows in the Farmer-Laborites, but the President's chance of carrying the State is much improved." Roosevelt swept Minnesota and the nation in a landslide, proving that if you can't beat 'em, join 'em!

TRADE POLICY
Short-term pain, but we'll one day appreciate Trump's intervention
A retired farmer (Readers Write, Jan. 26) asserts that China will default on its trade deal with President Donald Trump because it has defaulted on deals in the past.
This is a fatalist view. Yes, our trade arrangement with China has been one-sided. This is the main reason Trump ran -- to correct these trade deals. If they renege now, he'll put the tariffs on again. The Chinese need trade with the U.S. more than we need it with them. Their plants produce all the trinkets we buy. They need to keep these operating. It started with U.S. companies moving their production to China, closing their plants and laying off workers. The products then came into the States without any tax or upcharge. These companies then sold these items into the market to Home Depot/Target/Walmart, etc., for less than what it would have cost if they were paying U.S. workers to make them. Good deal for us consumers, right? China was not required to buy an even amount from the United States. Hence, China was ahead some $650 billion in trade. So, Trump put tariffs on these items coming in to price them as if they were made here. He gives this tariff money to the farmers because China has cut back on purchases of agricultural items to punish Trump.
It now raises the question, "How did the U.S. farmers get so dependent on China's agricultural purchases?" Did some politicians benefit from all this China production? And it's not just the farmers that are complaining about this. U.S. companies that moved their manufacturing to China or Mexico are having to pay a tax on those items. Ouch! It's called "coming home to roost." It'll take Trump all eight years to get these uneven trade deals corrected, but in the end, a lot of manufacturing jobs will be created in the United States. That'll make this short-term pain worthwhile.

COLLEGE SPORTS
Include women's teams in any discussion of division shift
Regarding "Far-flung recruiting net needed by St. Thomas" (Sports, Jan. 26), it's unfortunate that focus is entirely on the two largest men's sports teams at a university that also has competitive and nationally ranked women's teams. As of December, national Division III rankings placed the women's basketball and hockey teams at No. 9 and soccer team at No. 10. The women's soccer team ended its season in an overtime shootout during the NCAA Elite Eight, with a final record of 17-2-5, a 17-game unbeaten streak overall and a 26-game home unbeaten streak. Its coach, Sheila McGill, recently named MIAC Coach of the Year for the third time, has long recruited young women talented enough to play Division I soccer who seek a college experience that balances athletics with academic rigor, and she places great emphasis on character, leadership and community within her team dynamics. She and the other coaches of women's teams -- who, like men's teams, lose top recruits to DI and DII scholarship offers -- undoubtedly have the same level of anticipation about the looming NCAA decision as their counterparts who coach men's teams. In an era when the U.S. women's soccer team dominates the world stage and in a community where the women's professional basketball team has brought home four national titles, it's shortsighted for sports journalists to exclude women's teams from this conversation.

TARGET REMODEL
Unlike an earlier Edina letter writer, I'd have to say I approve
Like a Jan. 26 letter writer ("Target remodel: I don't like it"), I also live in Edina -- a mere half-mile from the SuperTarget store. During the massive renovation, I was amazed that the store never closed (that I can recall). They sheltered much of the construction equipment and materials in huge tents in a portion of the parking lot. They made sure customers came into a clean store every morning after the overnight construction and remodeling. There were always extra staff members with neat gadgets to immediately get help finding where specific departments and items were "today." All of these folks seemed to be well-trained and patient.
Now the store is welcoming, as always, with a diverse staff.
I'm guessing it is even more welcoming to those younger shoppers who need products and services about which I (at age 76) may say "not so much." As an elder, I'd like to believe there is a bit of the "Dayton's heritage" in the way Target conducts its business.

Texto completo: Four years ago, Joanne Beer - then a transplant from Portland, Ore., studying for her Ph.D. in biostatistics in Pittsburgh - was part of that younger, educated cohort that backed Sen. Bernie Sanders in his upstart presidential bid as it fell just short of the Democratic nomination.
Since then, a lot has changed for Beer, now 38, who moved across the state to Philadelphia for her postdoctoral work at the University of Pennsylvania. But while the Beltway elites looked around for a new flavor of the month, Beer and her new friends in the group Philly for Bernie, which she cochairs, rolled up their sleeves and went to work from phone banks to debate watch parties.
Beer told me on Wednesday that Sanders' amazing political consistency since he first ran as an obscure third-party candidate in the early 1970s shows "that he's not going to waver in his integrity - and young people find that appealing. It doesn't seem like he's some technocrat, talking down to young people."
With the first votes of a seemingly endless campaign finally to be cast Monday night in snowy Iowa's first-in-the-nation caucuses, the latest polls show the lifelong democratic socialist poised to claim the victory in the Hawkeye State that eluded him by less than a percentage point when he faced Hillary Clinton in 2016. What's more, Sanders is also in a good position to win the next week's New Hampshire primary (which he won in a landslide four years ago), and historically every Democrat who's pulled off this Daily Double has gone on to the nomination.
Bernie's blowout support from the 18-to-34 voting bloc cuts across racial lines, and as a result he's also the leading candidate for the Latinx vote while second and gaining among black Democrats. But there's something interesting about the Sanders spike, and I'm far from the first to notice this. He's on an electoral path that seems strikingly similar to the way Donald Trump shocked the world and captured the White House in 2016. Let's call it the Trump track.
Just like Trump, Sanders has spent much of the yearlong run-up to Iowa with the punditocracy convinced there's no way that he could ever win the nomination, that the party machinery would somehow coalesce around a more centrist candidate. Yet also much like 2016's GOP standard-bearer, a large field of alternative candidates has divided the anti-Sanders vote among pols who do nothing for their party's angry, change-seeking base.
Sanders continues to draw huge crowds at his rallies, just like Trump. Both have fanatical supporters that have been known to cause offense, including Sanders' notorious online "Bernie Bros," and both candidates are highly distrustful of the mainstream media. And each man is, in his own way, a populist - drawing strength from the anger of an American working class that's watched factory jobs dry up and wages stagnate while college and medical costs soared, and which harbors resentments toward the elites they blame for making that happen.
Given all these similarities, it's not hard to see how the pundit class - the same folks, remember, who saw neither Trump nor Sanders coming in their rearview mirrors - is also convinced that a President Bernie Sanders would govern as a "Trump of the left," and govern badly.
Here's how the New York Times editorial board - a fairly good barometer of elite opinion, no? - dismissed Sanders in its now infamous editorial endorsing Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar: "Only his prescriptions can be the right ones, even though most are overly rigid, untested and divisive." The only problem with this frequent knock on Sanders is that he's been in elected office since 1981 and his record is nothing like that.
When Sanders was elected mayor of Burlington, Vt., as an unapologetic socialist, he had essentially no allies on his city council or business community, and yet he figured out ways to work with them on issues from building low-income housing to attracting a minor-league baseball team.
The packed arenas at a Trump rally and a Sanders rally might look the same in pictures - but at only one of them are they chanting hate toward refugees at the border or for locking up a president's political opponents, or cheering when dissenters are roughed up.
Yes, Bernie Sanders is a populist, and Donald Trump is a populist - but not all populism is created equal. There is right-wing populism in which a demagogue manipulates the anger of everyday people and steers it away from the CEO who got a huge bonus for eliminating their job and toward The Other - Mexican migrants or women or even the disabled. And then there's the kind of populism that addresses struggling people by trying to solve their problems.
The powers-that-be missed an opportunity to "stop Bernie" by ignoring this middle class. Now it may be that not stopping Bernie may be the only way to stop Trump on Nov. 3.

Texto completo: Peter Serkin, 72, who took his training at the conservative Curtis Institute of Music and cut a wholly original path through the classical piano scene, died Saturday, Feb. 1, at home in Red Hook, N.Y., of pancreatic cancer, his manager said.
As a player, programmer, and stage personality, there was no one else like Mr. Serkin. He put his career on hold to find spiritual enlightenment, and simultaneously embraced the period-instrument and avant-garde repertoire, with an originality of interpretation that was interpreted by some as an act of artistic rebellion. The scion of an illustrious family of old-world musicians - his father was pianist and Curtis teacher/director Rudolf Serkin, his grandfather violinist Adolf Busch - Mr. Serkin was decidedly of the new world.
He performed with orchestras worldwide, including the Philadelphia Orchestra, Boston Symphony Orchestra, Los Angeles Philharmonic, New York Philharmonic, and English Chamber Orchestra, and had been slated to play a Philadelphia Chamber Music Society all-Bach recital with violinist Pamela Frank this March.
In classical music's atmosphere of strict performance tradition and unforgiving proscription, Mr. Serkin offered reality-bending experiences.
In the pianist's last recital here, at the Kimmel in January 2019, this critic found Mr. Serkin to be a performer "who likes to rearrange time and space around him."
In that Philadelphia Chamber Music Society recital, his Bach Goldberg Variations unfurled one revelation after another with "a bone-dry sound in the left hand here, a violent start to a variation there. In various spots he emulated organ or harpsichord. He didn't shy from emotion, making variations strident, searching, pastoral, or fragile."
Born in New York, Peter Adolf Serkin was a prodigy cultivated in the artistically related hothouses of Curtis and the Marlboro Music Festival, the Vermont summer retreat cofounded by his grandfather and father along with others. He entered Curtis at age 11, and studied with Mieczyslaw Horszowski; Lee Luvisi; and his father, who had a top-tier performing career and would later become head of the school.
It was Rudolf Serkin who helped to introduce him to Philadelphia Orchestra audiences several years before the boy graduated from Curtis. Together, they performed the Mozart Concerto for Two Pianos, K. 365, in 1961, when Peter Serkin was 14.
They repeated the feat at Carnegie Hall with the Marlboro Festival Orchestra, with the younger Serkin showing "considerable intensity of feeling in passages when he played alone," according to a New York Times review.
He graduated from Curtis in 1964 and won a Grammy in 1966 for most promising new classical recording artist, and set off on a major career.
"Peter Serkin has the instincts of a rebel and a non-conformist," declared New York Times music critic Harold C. Schonberg of the pianist's first full-scale New York recital in 1967.
He struck many as a flower child, too, at least for a time. In 1973, with violinist Ida Kavafian, cellist Fred Sherry, and clarinetist Richard Stoltzman, he founded TASHI, whose groovy album covers turned on many a listener to Messiaen, Webern, and Takemitsu.
He had a special focus on new music, "and yet he played the normal classical repertoire beautifully," said former Curtis director Gary Graffman.
He continued to solo with the Philadelphia Orchestra regularly from the 1960s through 2008 - in Mozart, Beethoven, Bartok, Ravel, Stravinsky, Hindemith, Takemitsu, Brahms, and Peter Lieberson. He performed with the Philadelphia Chamber Music Society more than a dozen times.
Over the years, he taught at Curtis, the Juilliard School, Yale University, and Bard College. Mr. Serkin brought an unusually thoughtful approach to teaching.
"He didn't tell me how something should be played," said pianist Simone Dinnerstein, who studied with him for two years at Juilliard and one more privately. "Usually what would happen is, I would play the piece and then there'd be a kind of long silence while he was thinking about it. And then he would start asking questions. And I had the sense that he was just as interested in the music as I was, that he was just as curious about trying to find out how to approach the piece."
If his pedigree made him destined for classical music, Mr. Serkin took some detours. He sometimes dropped out of performing in the late 1960s and early '70s for matters more spiritual and philosophical in Mexico, Tibet, India, Morocco, and elsewhere.
He held a lifelong fascination for certain pieces, like Beethoven's Diabelli Variations and Bach's Goldberg Variations. He was an early adopter when the period-instrument movement came along, recording Beethoven and Schubert on a fortepiano in the early 1980s.
One of his first concerts in Philadelphia was at Curtis, where, as Curtis piano professor Eleanor Sokoloff remembers it, he played Schumann.
"He was a child, really, it was so gorgeous, he was 12 or 13," said Sokoloff, who has taught at Curtis for more than eight decades and continues to teach there at age 105. "It was the way it was played, like a person in his late 80s reminiscing about life."
Mr. Serkin is survived by five children, Karina, Maya, Elena, Stefan, and William; two grandchildren; and his former wives, Wendy Spinner and Regina Touhey Serkin. Details on services were not immediately available.

Texto completo: EVER since Kobe Bryant's tragic death Sunday, he's been embraced by Philadelphia more closely than he ever managed during his Hall of Fame NBA career.
Obituaries and remembrances referred to the basketball superstar as "Philadelphia-born." Sports columnists detailed how alike Bryant and his tough, competitive, basketball-mad hometown were. A New York Times article was headlined, "Kobe Bryant, Philly Guy."
So it's somewhat jarring to find out that Bryant, who played high school basketball at suburban Lower Merion High, wasn't a native Philadelphian at all. Despite what his birth certificate said, he was born just across the border in Montgomery County.
It's a minor but not insignificant difference given the Lower Merion High graduate's complicated relationship with Philadelphia and its fans. While many here adored him, others felt he disrespected the city with comments he made as a Laker. In particular, Bryant agitated the locals in 2001 when he called Los Angeles "my hometown."
The geographical distinction of his birth came to light with the discovery of a brief Sports People item in the Aug. 24, 1978, Inquirer, the day after Bryant was born.
"A third child was born to 76er forward Joe (Jellybean) Bryant and his wife, Pam, at Lankenau Hospital."
Founded in 1866 by John Lankenau as the German Hospital, Lankenau had been situated in North Philadelphia for nearly a century. But in 1953 it moved to the former site of Overbrook Golf Club, near City and Lancaster Avenues, in Wynnewood, Lower Merion Township.
"That property has always been in Lower Merion Township," said Jody Kelley, the township's secretary.
Contemporary newspaper accounts correctly placed the new hospital in Lower Merion, but Lankenau, perhaps because associating itself with the city's rich medical history lent it prestige, used Philadelphia on its stationery.
When Bryant was born there 23 years later, Philadelphia was listed in the Lower Merion facility's official address, According to Kelley, that section of Wynnewood then shared a 19151 Philadelphia zip code with the neighborhood across City Avenue.
As a result, for decades birth certificates issued for Lankenau-born babies cited Philadelphia as the place of birth.
Eventually, Kelley believed it was "sometime in the 1980s," just about the time Joe Bryant brought his family back from Italy and settled in Lower Merion, the hospital got a Wynnewood zip code, 19096.

Texto completo: Surely you remember the “basket of deplorables.”
That was Hillary Clinton’s 2016 characterization of some Donald Trump supporters. Observers saw it as a major gaffe, and conservatives erupted in hot, “How dare you!” indignation at the idea there was anything deplorable about voting for a lying, racist, misogynistic, vagina-grabbing, deadbeat.
Few people, if any, dared point out the obvious. Which is that Clinton was right.
Well, welcome to deja vu all over again. Recently on CNN, Don Lemon presided over a segment about Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who recently blew up at an NPR reporter for having the temerity to ask him about Ukraine. The reporter says Pompeo challenged her to find that country on a map, which she did. Panelist Rick Wilson, a former GOP strategist, opined that Pompeo “knows deep within his heart that Donald Trump couldn’t find Ukraine on a map if you had the letter U and a picture of an actual physical crane next to it.”
At which Lemon started laughing and could not stop. He lowered his head to the desk as Wilson and a second panelist, New York Times columnist Wajahat Ali, adopted dumb rube accents in mockery of Trump supporters.
Wilson: “Donald Trump’s the smart one — and y’all elitists are dumb!”
Ali: “‘You elitists with your geography and your maps — and your spelling!’”
Trump World was predictably, if hypocritically, outraged. Lemon would later assert that he was laughing only at the initial joke and that he didn’t hear — and disavows —the mockery. But the Poynter Institute, among other journalism professionals, was unpersuaded. It called Lemon’s behavior “unprofessional.“ You’ll get no argument here. Lemon’s attack of the tee-hee-hees reflected poorly on him, his employer and his profession.
But Wilson and Ali’s jokes — riffing as it does not just on Trump World’s ignorance, but on its hostility to knowledge — strikes a chord. Consider an anecdote from the new book “A Very Stable Genius” by Philip Rucker and Carol Leonnig. Trump visits a sacred American shrine, the USS Arizona Memorial at Pearl Harbor. He’s being ferried out to this iconic site, and he pulls then-Chief of Staff John Kelly aside. “Hey, John, what’s this all about?” he asks. “What’s this a tour of?”
Maybe if it were a one-off, you could ignore it. But from his disinterring of Frederick Douglass to the creative spellings of his tweets to his geographic gaffes (“We just got back from the Middle East,” he once announced — in Israel) Trump produces daily, incontrovertible evidence of his intellectual dullness.
Which, in Trump World, will cost him absolutely nothing. Small wonder. A 2015 survey by the Pew Research Center found that among Americans with college and post-graduate degrees, progressives outpace conservatives by a wide margin. In other words, the right is less well educated.
In Trump, they’ve found someone who validates their inchoate biases and fears — and they don’t much care that he doesn’t know what happened at Pearl Harbor.
If you happen to be one of those crazy folks who thinks knowing stuff is good — especially on the world stage — that’s frightening. And it lends a certain perspective to Lemon’s lapses.
Once again, a side issue takes center stage. And the obvious goes unsaid.

Texto completo: BRUNSWICK, Maine -- Mainers told Sen. Angus King at a Sunday event that they've lost faith in the federal government's system of checks and balances due to Congress' handling of the impeachment of President Donald Trump.
"My faith is shaken in the system I'm teaching to my students, the system of checks and balances," said John Dever, a high school social studies teacher from Bath. "I genuinely believe this is a crisis."
King held a listening session Sunday afternoon at Bowdoin College to hear constituents' thoughts on the process surrounding Trump's impeachment and the Senate's vote slated for Wednesday.
The session drew so many people that an overflow room was opened so everyone could participate. Brunswick is a largely left-leaning part of the state, and no one spoke in support of Trump or the Republican-led Senate that is likely to acquit him.
King, an independent former two-term Maine governor who caucuses with Democrats, told WCSH on Friday he is likely to vote to remove Trump from office even though the motion is virtually assured to fail in the Republican-led Senate.
King would not say exactly how he would vote on the two articles of impeachment. He said he is worried by the precedent of acquitting Trump on the second article -- obstructing Congress ― saying it could allow presidents to stonewall Congress in the future.
He blasted the trial process after all Republicans but Susan Collins of Maine and Mitt Romney of Utah voted down a bid to allow new witnesses in the trial later Friday. In a statement, he said it was "an abdication of our responsibilities, an asterisk on these proceedings, and a stain on our institution."
Collins, a Republican who is up for re-election in 2020 as a top target of Democrats, will be perhaps the most-watched senator during the acquittal vote that is set for Wednesday.
King said Collins made the "right decision on Friday" in voting to allow witnesses, but said he does not know how she will vote Wednesday.
Topping any list of potential witnesses was former Trump national security adviser John Bolton, who roiled proceedings last week when portions of his unreleased manuscript were published by The New York Times that directly related to the articles of impeachment filed by House Democrats against the president for abuse of power and obstructing a congressional investigation.
Bolton alleges Trump told him in August that a hold on military aid to Ukraine was tied to the country launching an investigation into the family of former Vice President Joe Biden, the front-runner for the 2020 Democratic nomination to face Trump, and that the president asked Bolton to call the Ukrainian leader and ask him to meet with Rudy Giuliani, Trump's attorney, on investigating rivals. The president has denied both claims.
Before the Ukraine revelations emerged, King had been reluctant to join members of the Democratic caucus in pushing impeachment. In late 2018, he called himself a "conservative" on the issue. He told CNN in April 2019 that it could strengthen Trump politically.
On Sunday, King said he was unsure how the impeachment would affect Trump politically, saying, "We will find out in November."
But he said last month that acquitting the president on the abuse of power charge would "be the largest transfer of power from the Congress to the executive [branch] in the history of the country."
He reiterated that concern Sunday, agreeing with members of the audience who fear the precedent set by allowing Trump to "stonewall Congress" would have lasting impacts on our democracy.
Some attendees brought up the possibility of a bipartisan censure vote on the president if the Senate acquits him. A censure is a formal and public condemnation of the president, though it would not take away any of his power.
"My concern over the Senate's likely acquittal of the president is that it fails to punish even what some Republican senators have called wrong and inappropriate behavior. Without public condemnation of his actions, he is likely to continue such behavior or do even worse," said Kelly McDaniel of Portland.
King said he didn't want to discuss the possibility of a censure until after Wednesday's vote.

SANAA, Yemen - Tribal leaders said Saturday that a suspected U.S. drone strike destroyed a building housing al-Qaida militants last week in eastern Yemen.
President Donald Trump, meanwhile, retweeted several tweets and media reports that seemed to offer confirmation the Jan. 25 strike killed top al-Qaida leader Qassim al-Rimi.
The tribal leaders said the drone strike took place in the Wadi Ubaidah area in the eastern province of Marib. The area is known as a stronghold for al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, or AQAP, as the Yemeni affiliate is known. They said at least three explosions rocked the area, and that the building was set ablaze.
It was not immediately clear how many militants were in the building at the time or their identities. The tribal leaders said a handful of al-Qaida militants arrived at the area directly after the strike and cordoned off the area.
The White House did not comment on whether Trump's retweeting was confirmation and The Associated Press has asked administration officials to clarify.
The CIA declined to comment.
The attack was first reported by The New York Times.
Al-Rimi succeeded Nasser al-Wahishi, who was killed in a U.S. drone strike in 2015, as the top leader of AQAP.
Among Trump's retweets was a thread by Rita Katz, director of SITE Intelligence Group, which tracks messaging by militant groups. Katz said the attack took place Jan. 25 and she began tweeting about it Jan. 27.
"If true, and it seems to be, the death of al-Rimi would mark a major blow to #AlQaeda on the whole. Al-Rimi was a candidate for succeeding AQ leader Zawahiri," Katz tweeted Thursday. She was referring to al-Qaida chief Ayman al-Zawahiri.
Katz said that of all living al-Qaida leaders, al-Rimi "was the most compelling, known for his charisma & beloved across the AQ community."
AQAP has long been considered the global network's most dangerous branch and has attempted to carry out attacks on the U.S. mainland.
Yemen was plunged into civil war in 2014. Al-Qaida and an Islamic State affiliate have exploited the chaos to expand their presence in the country.

Texto completo: BY KEVIN FREKING
The Associated Press
WASHINGTON - Two decades ago, President Bill Clinton addressed a nation transfixed by impeachment. He didn't use the I-word once in a State of the Union address that ran on for 78 minutes.
Now, President Donald Trump prepares to address the nation under similar circumstances, with the added pressure of a looming presidential election thrown into the mix. And no one expects him to follow the Clinton model by ignoring the elephant in the room - especially since he now appears likely to be acquitted the day after the speech.
Trump is hardly the first president to deliver a State of the Union address in a time of turmoil. Abraham Lincoln delivered a written report during the Civil War, Richard Nixon spoke while embroiled in the Watergate scandal. Gerald Ford declared "the state of the union is not good." But Clinton's 1999 speech offers the most obvious parallels.
A Republican-controlled House impeached Clinton in December 1998 on grounds that he had lied to a federal grand jury and obstructed justice about his relationship with White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
Just hours before Clinton delivered his State of the Union address, White House lawyers opened their defense of the president in his Senate trial. They argued he was innocent of the charges and "must not be removed from office."
Clinton's address, in the same chamber where he had been impeached weeks earlier, was met with respectful applause, though some Republicans decided to boycott the address saying it was inappropriate for Clinton to appear before Congress during his impeachment trial. Two of his harshest Republican critics, House Majority Leader Dick Armey, of Texas, and House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, of Texas, sat stonily side by side.
Clinton speechwriter Michael Waldman said he can't recall any discussion leading up to the 1999 address about whether Clinton should talk about the impeachment proceedings.
"It never was considered," says Waldman, president of the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU School of Law. "His entire goal in a speech like that was to remind people of the policy agenda that he cared about and that they liked, and also to remind people of the parts of the presidency that they liked."
Clinton focused his speech on using the large majority of a projected $4 trillion surplus over 15 years to shore up Social Security and Medicare. Republicans resisted and instead called for tax cuts. Indeed, he offered so many policy proposals that one Democratic lawmaker, Rep. Joseph Moakley, of Massachusetts, remarked; "He did everything but buy a new dress for the Statue of Liberty."
At the time, the economy was entering its third consecutive year of economic growth exceeding 4%. An astonishing 69% of the country approved of the job Clinton was doing as president and 29% disapproved, according to Gallup polling. The Senate would go on to acquit Clinton the following month.
Twenty-five years earlier, Nixon devoted much of his final State of the Union speech to the country's energy crisis. But near the end of his remarks, he added a "personal word" about Watergate. Nixon called for the investigation to end, declaring "one year of Watergate is enough" and said he had no "intention whatever" of resigning.
Nixon's poll standing bumped up past the two-thirds level after his State of the Union address. But there was more to Watergate, and as that scandal wore on, into impeachment proceedings, his job approval steadily sank, to 23% at the point he finally quit.
The New York Times recounted that Republicans in the chamber greeted Nixon with applause, cheers and whoops for more than two minutes. The "most startling demeanor" was on the Democratic side. Sen. Sam Ervin, chairman of the Watergate Committee, didn't applaud once. While snickers and grimaces greeted Nixon's pledge to protect Americans from such privacy invasions as "electronic snooping."
Trump is coming into the election year with his approval rating at 44% and his disapproval rating at 53%, according to the latest Gallup numbers. In seeking reelection, Trump is hoping to use a backlash against impeachment to help motivate his core supporters, but he also needs to reach out to a broader swath of voters.
The final vote in Trump's impeachment trial is now set for Wednesday afternoon. Republican strategist Matt Mackowiak said there will be other opportunities for Trump to get the last word in on impeachment. The State of the Union is not that time.
"I think in many ways the single best opportunity he has with this particular State of the Union will be to attract a broader coalition of supporters," Mackowiak said. "I'm hoping that he doesn't go on offense too much."
Still, Trump can hardly get through any event at the White House without talking about the impeachment inquiry and trial. His comments in greeting the Louisiana State University college football champions and in signing a new trade deal with Canada and Mexico inevitably included references to the impeachment proceedings.
Aaron Kall, director of debate at the University of Michigan and an author about memorable State of the Union addresses, said that, based on history, Trump would be best served keeping the public's focus off impeachment during the State of the Union.
"The Clinton model proved to be successful," Kall said. But knowing Trump, he added, "It will be impossible for him not to take a victory lap."

Texto completo: Want to escape the tundra but don't have the budget or time to jet to the Caribbean? Some Twin Cities theaters bring the tropics to us.
Three shows -- "Once on This Island," "Bob Marley's Three Little Birds" and "How Black Mothers Say I Love You" -- deal with tropical themes or are set in places that Minnesotans are keen to visit this time of year. While being transported to fantastic realms that inspired magical realism, we can have more than just a tourist experience with the cultures presented onstage.
"Island," Lynn Ahrens' and Stephen Flaherty's effusive 1990 musical whose Broadway tour opens Tuesday at the Ordway, is probably the splashiest of the tropical theater shows. Set on an island in the French Antilles that has been devastated by a hurricane, the fairy tale marries "Romeo and Juliet" with "The Little Mermaid." In the story, Ti Moune, a poor, dark-skinned peasant girl, falls in love with Daniel Beauxhomme, a wealthy, light-skinned man.
The New York Times called the Tony-winning 2017 revival "a big, bold delight," while the Hollywood Reporter used words such as "ravishing" and "glorious" to describe a production with "melodies … firmly grounded in the Broadway musical vernacular [and] infused with Caribbean rhythms without veering into cultural appropriation."
Syncopated beats also drive the colorful and ebullient regional premiere of "Three Little Birds" at the Children's Theatre Company. The one-act musical, which takes place in Jamaica and features 15 songs by the late king of reggae, revolves around Ziggy, a boy who survived a frightening storm. Now traumatized and timid, he gains confidence and courage to come out of his shell with the help of his community.
"Three Little Birds" has two kinds of warmth, Star Tribune theater critic Chris Hewitt wrote -- "the kind you get from a friendly welcome and the kind you get in the tropics."
"This show is about celebration but also about resilience as people survive, transform and influence the world around them," said Sh¡ Cage, director of "Three Little Birds." Cage aimed to convey not just warmth, but a feeling from Marley's music. The show carries the "rhythm, the heartbeat, the drum, and things that you can't necessarily just hear or see or touch."
The tropical trend continues at Penumbra Theatre, where, in April, "How Black Mothers Say I Love You" will be staged. Written by Trey Anthony, the drama plumbs the emotional trauma that fills the void when a mother leaves her child in Jamaica for six years while she goes to the U.S. to find work.
Signe Harriday is slated to direct this show that also touches on timely issues.
Bittersweet vibes
"It's a bittersweet story of mothers and daughters, but it also addresses the question of immigration and whether or not we can be compassionate to people who work so hard to ensure better opportunities for their children," said Sarah Bellamy, artistic director of Penumbra Theatre. "I hadn't anticipated how much the U.S. would be turning its back on the Caribbean, especially with what's happening with Puerto Rico, when we programmed this show. If anything, I hope we can appreciate our shared humanity as we sit in a theater together, hearing each other's gasps and laughs."
At its best, theater -- like film, books and other art forms -- transports audiences to different places psychically, emotionally and intellectually. Shows can be portals to new knowledge or aspirational forms of escape.
The Twin Cities theaters seek to entertain and broaden horizons. "Island" and "Birds" both feature hurricanes as destructive catalysts -- scaring protagonist Ziggy in "Three Little Birds" and forcing two people together under emergency circumstances who may not ordinarily interact in "Island."
And both musicals have spiritual dimensions drawn from the islands' complicated histories that include colonialism and bondage. In fact, the characters' belief systems in the musicals can be traced to Africa. The vodou that predominates in "Island" nods to this lineage, including characters such as Asaka, Mother of the Earth; Agw, the God of Water; Erzulie, Goddess of Love, and Papa Ge, the Demon of Death.
"Three Little Birds" is informed by obeah, Jamaica's corollary to vodou, and the show's villain is named Duppy, after the duppies, or ghosts, that are widely believed in by folks in the island's countryside.
Economic disparities and privations wrought by that history, and by new catastrophes, also are at play in the backdrops of all the works. Jamaica and Haiti, where "Three Little Birds" and "Island" take place, respectively, are, by American standards, poor. Yet, the characters in these musicals don't measure their worth by their possessions, showing pride in how they repurpose and transform the things that they have.
Such resourcefulness also informed the choices of the creative teams behind these shows. "Island" costume designer Clint Ramos used the phrase "turning the discarded into the divine to describe his approach to the vibrant patchwork clothing of the show's characters.
A similar ethos also held sway at the Children's Theatre, said "Three Little Birds" director Cage. You can see it not just in the colors and the costumes, but in "the history that's stitched together, in the [go] cart that Cedella has. I love that part of the culture. I've got three sticks over here and some wheels. I can make something of this."
Audiences who see these tropical-themed shows will have more than a glancing tourist experience.
"Obviously, the show deals with themes of colonization and colorism and class, themes that we're still grappling with," said Cassondra James, who plays Erzulie in "Island." "The question is how do we love and offer forgiveness? How do we take the brokenness that's all around us and make something whole?"
James, who spoke from Chicago, where "Island" played before coming to the Twin Cities, said that the show has lessons for us all.
"People come to the theater for the entertainment and music and great design -- there's a lot to thrill an audience," she said. "But there's also a message around ecological devastation. The people of the island are trying to piece together a world. Piece by piece, we take the scraps of our lives and create something beautiful and sacred."

Trump bashes Democratic rivals during pre-Super Bowl show

Texto completo: President Trump used a Super Bowl pregame interview to rail against Democrats, accusing them of hatred and offering schoolyard insults about his potential 2020 rivals.
“I see the hatred. . . . They don't care about fairness, they don't care about lying," Trump said in a taped interview with Fox News Channel's Sean Hannity, which aired on Fox hours before sports' biggest night of the year.
Trump spent his weekend in Florida as most of the political world has been focused on Iowa, where Democrats on Monday cast their first votes to choose the party's nominee.
Prompted by Hannity, Trump went through most of the major candidates one by one, deriding “Sleepy Joe" Biden, the former vice president, accusing Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren of telling “fairy tales," and labeling Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist, as “a communist," even though he's not.
But Trump seemed most preoccupied by the candidates who has chosen to skip the early-voting states: Michael Bloomberg, the former New York mayor who has been blanketing the airwaves with anti-Trump ads.
The president's campaign and Bloomberg's will be running dueling, multimillion-dollar ads during Sunday night's game.
In the Fox interview, Trump accused Bloomberg, who is widely reported to be 5 feet, 8 inches tall, of making a special request for a box to stand on if he qualifies for future presidential debates. Bloomberg's campaign denies that is the case.
“Why should he get a box to stand on?" Trump asked. “Why should he be entitled to that, really? Then does that mean everyone else gets a box?"
Bloomberg campaign spokeswoman Julie Wood said Trump was "lying."
“He is a pathological liar who lies about everything: his fake hair, his obesity, and his spray-on tan," she said.
A Democratic official said there have been no discussions about the topic, noting that Bloomberg has yet to qualify for a debate.

Trump campaign and RNC spent $9m in fourth quarter
President Trump's campaign and the Republican National Committee together spent more than $9 million on polling, digital ads, and fees paid to Trump-owned properties in the last three months of 2019, according to filings with the Federal Election Commission released Friday.
The filings detail how the Trump campaign, the Trump Victory committee, a third entity called the Trump Make America Great Again Committee, and the national party committee spent their cash from October through the end of December. Together, they previously reported raising $154 million over those months and closed the year with $195 million in cash on hand.
The Trump apparatus has raised an outsize sum, but it has faced questions about how, exactly, it is spending its reserves. Even though he is not funding his own bid this time around, Trump has repeatedly grilled his advisers about where and how they are spending money.
According to a New York Times analysis, the biggest expenditure in the final three months of the year was on digital advertising. From October to December, the campaign spent more than $6 million on digital ads. The T-MAGA committee spent another $3.2 million on digital ads.
The campaign also spent $525,000 on polling in that period. The Republican National Committee spent $2.2 million on polling.
The Trump campaign spent about $194,000 at Trump-owned properties. The filings show that the groups supporting Trump's reelection together made 150 separate payments to Trump-owned entities and properties, totaling nearly $600,000 for the three-month period, and $1.7 million for the year.

GOP lawmaker: Constitution says it's OK to shoot socialists
Representative Rodney Garcia, a state lawmaker in Montana, told a roomful of Republicans he believes the US Constitution says socialists can be jailed or shot simply for being socialists. Garcia initially made the statement at an election event, then he reiterated it to a Billings Gazette reporter.
The Republican Party in Montana swiftly rebuked him.
Garcia's assertion first came Friday night, after former interior secretary Ryan Zinke gave a speech at the party event in Helena. According to reporting from the Gazette, Garcia said he was concerned there were socialists "everywhere" in Billings, which he represents in House District 52.
Billings Gazette reporter Holly Michels later asked Garcia to clarify his remarks, and the lawmaker doubled down.
"So actually in the Constitution of the United States, [if you] are found guilty of being a socialist member you either go to prison or are shot," Garcia told Michels.
Garcia was not able to say where he finds that in the Constitution, the Billings Gazette reported.
Garcia did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Washington Post.

High-profile Iowa poll won't be releasedThe Des Moines Register and CNN have decided not to release the final installment of their presidential preference poll, fearing its results may have been compromised. Carol Hunter, the executive editor of the Iowa newspaper, posted the announcement Saturday night at the same time the results of the highly anticipated survey were supposed to be released.Hunter said that one of the poll respondents reported concerns earlier in the day, which raised questions about the integrity of the results."It appears a candidate's name was omitted in at least one interview in which the respondent was asked to name their preferred candidate," Hunter wrote in an article posted on the Register's website.“While this appears to be isolated to one surveyor, we cannot confirm that with certainty. Therefore, the partners made the difficult decision to not to move forward with releasing the Iowa Poll." Associated Press

Stories behind colorful paint names Names: Pink has many aliases -BYLN- By Kim Cook Associated Press

Texto completo: Ever wonder how paint colors get their names? If you’re shopping for pink, say, you’ll find dozens of shades referencing roses, bubble gum and shells. There are some extra-evocative names like Calamine and Dead Salmon. And what about a pink called Harajuku Morning? Modern Love?
Names can sway a person, says New York designer Daun Curry.
"We once had a client choose one paint color over another because the name was Peace and Happiness," she says.
More often, we pick a shade because we like it, says color consultant Debra Kling of New York, and "the names’ associations serve to augment our feelings about the hues."
She warns clients that paints when applied can look very different from their names: Creams, especially, easily veer into yellow territory, even when there’s no hint of that hue in their name.
Natalie Ebel, co-founder of the direct-to-consumer paint company Backdrop — which is behind Harajuku Morning and Modern Love — says choosing the right names for paint colors is essential.
"We encourage customers to not just paint their walls, but create their backdrop," she says. "So each name was chosen to evoke an emotional connection; we were inspired by real people, places, things and moods."
Farrow & Ball is known for creative naming; their latest Colour By Nature palette, made in collaboration with London’s Natural History Museum, was inspired by Werner’s Nomenclature of Colours, an 1814 guide that cross-references hues with markings and colorations found in nature. Scotch Blue, for example, suggests both the throat of a blue titmouse and copper ore.
Time and place also provide inspiration, says Farrow & Ball’s color consultant Joa Studholme.
"Occasionally, the paint name comes almost before the color. Plummett was mixed after an afternoon spent fishing on the river, where the color of the lead used to weight the fisherman’s line was a thing of such beauty that it just begged to be added to the Farrow & Ball palette," she says.
Studholme shares the back stories on two Farrow & Ball pinks, Calamine and Dead Salmon: "For many people of a certain age, Calamine lotion was an intrinsic part of early life. Applied to treat scraped knees, stings and the general travails of a lively childhood, it was always of comfort. And what was more calming, the actual lotion or its extraordinary delicate color? It certainly creates soothing rooms in the modern world," she says.
As for the fishy one, the name was found on a decorator’s invoice dated 1805 for a library. "Salmon is the color, and Dead actually refers to the matte paint finish," Studholme says.
Another rosy paint that Studholme thinks is well-named was inspired by the soft, feminine shade found in traditional ladies’ private quarters. But "Boudoir Pink" didn’t sit right, she says.
"So, we spent time considering how the boudoir got its name, only to discover it comes from the French bouder, meaning ‘to sulk.’ Thus, Sulking Room Pink was born," she says.
Pink has enjoyed a favored position in the color pantheon since at least 2014, when movie director Wes Anderson clad his "Grand Budapest Hotel" in the hue. That was followed by rose gold fever. Color company Pantone designated light pinks as signature colors in both 2016 and 2017.
Paint marketers generally like names that are aspirational, that stir the imagination. First Light is Benjamin Moore’s 2020 Color of the Year, a dreamy, soft shade of pink. The company’s director of color marketing and development, Andrea Magno, says that while the color was already part of Benjamin Moore’s 3,500-hue library, "it’s always fortuitous when the trend concept and color name complement one another. While descriptions like ‘light pink’ are quite straightforward, we also look for names that evoke positive associations and experiences."
PPG Paint’s senior color marketing manager, Dee Schlotter, says Linen Ruffle is the top pink requested on the company’s Paintzen platform. It’s a pale, taupe-tinged white with a pink undertone, named to evoke images of ruffly pillows and curtains.
And what about Kenny’s Kiss or Salsa Diane, two other pinks in the PPG collection? The former was named after an employee’s dog; the latter after a color lab stylist’s beachy dress.
HGTV Home by Sherwin-Williams’ color of the year is Romance, another gentle pink with a name that stirs feelings.
Ebel, of Backdrop, says pinks have been the most fun to name.
"I wanted to keep the colors and names approachable for people like me — I wasn’t a huge pink person before Backdrop," she says.
"Harajuku Morning was inspired by a trip we took to Tokyo in 2016. The color is bright, airy and fun, and reminded us of the playfulness of Takeshita Street, but in the morning before the crowds. Modern Love was inspired by one of my favorite New York Times columns — the color makes me think of the beautiful, messy feelings that come with relationships," she says.
Just like the beautiful, messy relationship we all have with the brushes, rollers and paint colors we bring home.

Democrats court doom by supporting Sanders

Texto completo: In 2018, a top adviser on the Bernie Sanders campaign published a book called "How Bernie Won." Its audacious title drove a story line about the 2016 primary campaign against Hillary Clinton: Sanders hadn't lost, not really. Rather, he had won in the states that mattered most, and his ideas were proven to be winners.
This is a fairy tale – and a dangerous one. If Democratic voters, hungry for a winner, buy into that myth and believe that Sanders is the most "electable" candidate, they will be making a grave mistake that could hand the presidency back to Donald Trump.
Let's start with the actual results in the 2016 primary. It was not remotely close. Sanders lost by 3.8 million votes, 57-43%. Clinton won 34 states and territories to his 23. Still, Sanders' team contends that the 2016 results augur well for him, because he dominated in the Midwest, where the presidency is often decided. In particular, they claim that he is popular in the former "Blue Wall" states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, which turned red in 2016 and delivered Trump his victory.
In fact, Sanders lost to Clinton by over 200,000 votes in the nine states of the Midwest. In the three onetime Blue Wall battleground states, she topped him by more than 45,000 votes, though he beat her in Wisconsin and edged her by a point in Michigan. In Ohio, Clinton won by 14 points and nearly 166,000 votes. The best you can say for Sanders is that he didn't lose as badly in the Midwest as he did elsewhere.
Indeed, in the Sunbelt, the other area that Democrats hope to make a battleground in 2020, Sanders got crushed. He lost Florida 64-33%, Arizona 58-40%, North Carolina 55-41% and Texas 65-33%. Taken together, Clinton trounced Sanders in those four states by more than 1.2 million votes.
And, of course, those were only primary voters. What would the general electorate make of Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.? We know that the Trump campaign will seek to label any Democratic nominee a "socialist" – a regular Republican tactic that usually goes nowhere because Democratic nominees have never really been socialists.
Sanders is different, though. As he said in a 1983 political debate: "I am a socialist; of course I'm a socialist."
The charge would stick, because this is an identity that he himself has proudly trumpeted. And 55% of Americans view socialism negatively. That would be quite a weight around a nominee's neck in a general election.
The potency of this pending attack is also underscored by Sanders' central policy proposal: "Medicare for All." His plan would hand the government control over nearly a fifth of the American economy. It doesn't take much Trumpian demagoguery to label that "socialized medicine."
When voters outside the liberal base learned more about this plan over the course of last year, initial curiosity, driven by its bumper-sticker name, collapsed. November polling from the Kaiser Family Foundation and the Cook Political Report found that "large shares of swing voters in Michigan, Minnesota, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin" say a national Medicare for All plan is a bad idea.
And we don't have to speculate about the political impact of Medicare for All. It was tested in the 2018 midterms when, as a University of Virginia study recently found, it cost Democrats in swing districts who embraced it nearly 5 points.
Worse, Sanders' overall record since 2016 guts his case. On the very day in 2017 that The New York Times published an op-ed he wrote entitled, "How Democrats Can Stop Losing Elections," his favored candidate in the Virginia gubernatorial primary got blown out by moderate Ralph Northam, who went on to trounce the Republican in the general election.
In 2018, Sanders waded into the Michigan governor's race and backed Abdul El-Sayed, a young, far-left candidate. He lost every county in the state to the more mainstream Gretchen Whitmer. She went on to soundly beat the Republican by promising not a "revolution" but rather to "fix the damn roads."
This pattern repeated itself across the country. Sanders and his political organization backed candidates at every level, to little or no avail. Their endorsees did not flip House seats from red to blue in 2018, proving his ideas work only in safely Democratic places.
All of this means that "How Bernie Won" is basically a book of fiction. Sanders has never won anything that really matters outside of Vermont, and all the available data shows that his ideas are politically toxic. Yet a week before primary voting begins, he is surging in Iowa, New Hampshire and California.
Democrats now face a monumental choice. Deciding which presidential candidate should go head to head with Trump is the paramount political calculation of our lifetimes. In the past, when Bernie Sanders has declared himself and his ideas to be "winners" in red and purple areas, it has turned out to be demonstrably false. Democrats must not be fooled by him now.

Texto completo: DES MOINES, Iowa - Democratic presidential hopefuls have been courting voters across this midwestern state for the past year with variations on the same pitch: Pick me to lead the party and beat Donald Trump.
Come Monday, Iowa Democrats participating in the nation's first presidential nominating contest will decide whose plea has been most effective.
Their choices will shape a contest that's as much about unseating President Trump as it is about forging an identity for a Democratic Party torn between its bold reimagining and a sensible path forward.
The results in Iowa won't settle the nomination, but they will begin to clarify a race without a real front-runner and set the lineup for next month's primaries in Ohio, Michigan and Pennsylvania - battlegrounds that were key to Mr. Trump's 2016 victory in the general election. By March, the field might have an unexpected new leader, or be down an early favorite. There's also the potential for the candidates clustered at the top to continue jockeying for the nomination through spring, setting the stage for a messy delegate battle at the Democratic National Convention.
How important is Iowa given its size and small proportion of delegates? In 1972, it became the first state to vote in the Democratic presidential primary, and since 2000 all its Democratic winners have gone on to become their party's nominee. Voters here relish the outsize attention from candidates and the media for a year leading up to the caucuses, despite arguments from outsiders that it's time for an overwhelmingly white and rural state to pass the torch to one that's more diverse.
The latest Iowa polling shows Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders with an edge heading into Monday. He's trailed by former Vice President Joe Biden, whose momentum appeared to peak at the outset of his candidacy. Rounding out the top are Pete Buttigieg, the former South Bend, Ind., mayor, and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who are both counting on their performances in Iowa to carry them to strong finishes in other early voting states.
In a final pitch to some 250 caucusgoers in Marshalltown, a central Iowa city still reeling from a destructive tornado that ripped through town in 2018, Mr. Buttigieg sought to set himself apart from his biggest rivals, painting Mr. Sanders as too liberal and uncompromising and Mr. Biden as too status quo.
"Vice President Biden has been talking about the idea that we can't afford to take a risk on somebody new. I believe history has shown us that we can't afford to take a risk of falling back on the familiar and expecting the same Washington playbook to help us against this president," he said.
"Senator Sanders ... has offered a politics that says it's all or nothing, my way or the highway, at a moment when we finally have an American majority who actually believes we can and should look to the public sector to make sure everybody has insurance. They're just not so sure about kicking people off their private plans."
At one point, each of the current top four has rode an Iowa surge, making the outcome Monday all the more uncertain.
Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, boosted by a New York Times endorsement shared with Ms. Warren, has been a steady moderate alongside Mr. Biden and Mr. Buttigieg, and is the candidate most likely to have a surprise breakthrough in Iowa. Businessman Andrew Yang and billionaire Tom Steyer are wild cards polling in the single digits.
There's also former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg, who skipped Iowa and early voting states for delegate-rich Super Tuesday and March primary states, a strategy that might upend the carefully laid plans of other candidates banking on early wins to help clinch the nomination.
With moderates and progressives, men and women, lawmakers and businessmen, a millennial and septuagenarians all represented in the field, some caucusgoers are overwhelmed by the choices in front of them. They also feel pressured to choose the best candidate to unseat Mr. Trump, who flew into Des Moines on Thursday for a rally and used the stage to mock his potential opponents.
"We can't do another four years," said Jennifer Barloon, a 36-year-old accountant who said Mr. Trump has pushed her to caucus for the first time. She's among the 11% of likely caucusgoers who are undecided, according to the last Des Moines Register Iowa Poll.
"I'm down to four, she's down to three. We'll make a decision on Monday night," said John Tagliareni, 49, who along with his wife attended Mr. Buttigieg's 550-person rally this week in Ankeny, Iowa, a fast-growing Des Moines suburb, where the former mayor is locking down support from older, white Iowans.
Campaign curveball
The home stretch in Iowa was thrown out of whack by Mr. Trump's impeachment trial, but the senators sidelined in Washington for the past two weeks are making up lost ground over the weekend. They won't need to be back in Washington until Wednesday for a final vote on whether to convict Mr. Trump, who is expected to be acquitted by the GOP majority.
Last week the senators deployed surrogates to campaign in their absence. Documentary filmmaker Michael Moore stumped for Mr. Sanders along with the senator's wife, Jane Sanders. Ms. Warren's campaign held a rally Friday in Des Moines with 700 people that featured her husband, Bruce Mann, and her golden retriever, Bailey, who posed for photos. The event was headlined by three female House lawmakers, who highlighted the senator's policy-driven plans and ability to unite diverse coalitions.
"I represent a Republican district, and I am all in for Elizabeth Warren," said Rep. Katie Porter, D-Calif., who flipped a GOP district in Orange County in the 2018 midterms that placed the U.S. House in Democratic control. "I know a thing or two about winning in every pocket of your community and connecting with every kind of voter, and I know Elizabeth is the candidate who can do that. She can reach into every pocket of our community - rural, urban, white, brown, black, young, old, LGBTQ."
Ms. Warren eventually landed in Iowa late Friday night and held an impromptu meet-and-greet at a bar in Des Moines' trendy East Village. The rest of the candidates have fanned out across the state to make their closing appeal to voters. Mr. Biden planned community events in blue counties clustered in the eastern part of the state. Back on the trail, Mr. Sanders attended a town hall outside Des Moines with Reps. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., and Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash. Some candidates are making their cases to rural voters at schools and community centers. Others are going for bigger rally crowds at hotel ballrooms or intimate meet-and-greets at coffee shops and breweries.
It's down to the wire for the candidates to sway undecided caucusgoers.
"I'm at 85%," said Shelby Ridley, 33, who attended the Friday night Warren rally and says she's likely caucusing for the senator. "I haven't paid a lot of attention until the last month because it's overwhelming and there are too many choices."

Texto completo: The natural process of body decomposition begins immediately when a person dies.
So when LNP | LancasterOnline reported Jan. 18 that the State Board of Funeral Directors had suspended the license of funeral director Andrew Scheid two days after the Lancaster County coroner “recovered four decomposing bodies” from his Millersville-area funeral home, we may have left a false impression.
It is not Scheid’s fault that the bodies were decomposing. All dead bodies in all funeral homes are decomposing, be they embalmed, refrigerated or just left out in the open. It’s what dead bodies do.
However, it is Scheid’s fault that the bodies were decomposing faster than they would have if he had adhered to the requirements of his profession. Pennsylvania law mandates that within 24 hours of death a body be buried, refrigerated (between 35 and 40 degrees), embalmed or placed in a container that seals in odors.
Scheid failed to do so, leaving bodies in a 55-degree room for up to 17 days, according to his suspension order. That failure wasn’t isolated, according to a state disciplinary action filed against him in December outlining 30 violations of law across 10 cases.
Somehow Scheid lost his grip on the reins of his operation, and people want to know why. What was he thinking? Because he hasn’t offered a public apology or explanation, we are left to wonder how a longtime fixture in the industry — his funeral home would have marked 25 years this year — could just collapse.
Something must have been going on behind the scenes, and for the first time a lot of folks find themselves in the unusual position of wanting to know what happens behind closed doors in a funeral home. Generally speaking, Americans prefer to insulate themselves from the messy reality of death, and speculating about how funeral directors spend their days would under normal circumstances seem like an unnecessarily morbid exercise.
Yet here we are.
From the dark specter of Charles Dickens’ Mr. Sowerberry in “Oliver Twist” to the menacing shadow of WWE’s Undertaker, literature, television and movies have done no favors for morticians, consistently portraying practitioners of the funerary trade as ghoulish caricatures.
The truth is at once more mundane and extraordinary. Funeral directors are regular people who have made death their life’s work. They raise families, take vacations, nurture hopes and aspirations, plan retirements, watch TV, eat pizza and go bowling like anyone else. To pay for it all, they manipulate, decorate, incinerate and otherwise dispose of dead bodies.
On the job, morticians wear many hats — sanitation worker, salesman, general laborer, sculptor, beautician and grief counselor — and the brims of those hats are coated with a thin layer of what author Caitlyn Doughty calls “people dust.”
In her 2014 New York Times best-seller “Smoke Gets in Your Eyes, and Other Lessons From the Crematory,” Doughty, a mortician, relates in a manner alternately reverent and sardonic the details of her workplace. She writes:
“A thin layer of dust and soot settles over everything, courtesy of the ashes of dead humans and industrial machinery. It settles in places you think impossible for dust to reach, like the inner lining of your nostrils. By midday I looked like the Little Match Girl, selling wares on a nineteenth-century street corner. There is not much to enjoy in a layer of inorganic human bone dusted behind one’s ear or gathered under a fingernail.”
That level of sharing bothers some people, even though the Bible clearly states (Genesis 3:19, for those keeping track) that we are made of dust and will return to dust in the end. If you prefer Joni Mitchell as your messenger, “We are stardust.” Also true.
Doughty succeeds in lifting the shroud of privacy that envelopes her industry by honestly portraying the personally challenging (she sometimes cries at work) and frequently gruesome (dead bodies are gross and unruly) aspects of the death trade.
Moreover, she directly addresses an issue that tends to bother people most about funeral directors: Are they helping us deal with our grief or capitalizing on it?
Doughty, a natural bootstrapper, puts the responsibility of controlling funeral costs squarely on the shoulders of American consumers, who, she believes, don’t plan for death because they don’t want to think about their real, inevitable end, let alone comparison shop for caskets and urns.
But few hold morticians blameless for the high cost of end-of-life disposal. Pot-stirring author Jessica Mitford turned the industry upside-down in 1963 when she published “The American Way of Death,” which painted funeral directors as shrewd, upselling businesspeople skilled at wringing every last dollar out of their customers’ tear-soaked hankies.
Her 1998 reboot, “The American Way of Death Revisited,” showed that little had changed in the intervening decades. Today, the industry’s image problem persists. Are funeral directors, as Mitford puts it, “merchants of a rather grubby order, preying on the grief, remorse and guilt of survivors, or trained professional men with high standards of ethical conduct? The funeral men would vastly prefer to fit the latter category.”
Where a funeral director falls on the continuum between grief shark and guiding light depends on his or her ability to effectively balance the grim tasks at hand, the pressure of running a profitable business, the need to help shepherd the bereaved, and the ever-present demands of their personal lives.
The difficulties inherent in striking that balance provide the backdrop for “Six Feet Under,” the award-winning HBO dramatic series about a family-run funeral home where life around the kitchen table upstairs is forever bleeding into business in the funeral parlor downstairs.
In a 2002 interview with Newsweek, Todd Van Beck, a career funeral home professional who at the time was serving as president of the New England Institute of Funeral Services, spoke for many of his colleagues in the industry when he praised the depiction of family life in the Fisher & Sons Funeral Home on “Six Feet Under.”
“ ‘Six Feet Under’ really portrays the lives of a family that runs a funeral home,” he said. “To me, it is a story about a dysfunctional family in America that just happens to live in a funeral home. I raised my family in a funeral home, and it was just like living in a home, except it happened to be a funeral home. … The show portrays the family’s joys and sorrows and ups and downs, but they just happen to be in a funeral home.”
Van Beck, by repeatedly using the phrase “just happens to live in a funeral home,” was attempting to blunty drive home the point that funeral home professionals are simply ordinary people with extraordinary jobs. When they’re not transporting human remains and filling chest cavities with embalming fluid, they’re regular folks.
Which brings us back to Mr. Scheid.
It is a matter of public record that Scheid — Andy, to those who deal with him regularly — has had to navigate over the past year a divorce, the death of his father and the death of his newborn child. Just one of those events is enough to throw the lives of regular folks into a tailspin.
Is it possible that his personal trials interfered with his professional duties? Certainly.
Would that excuse the level of carelessness that compounded the grief of his customers? Absolutely not.
Still, as we prepare to mete out judgment, either publicly or in our hearts, we would do well to remember that funeral directors are people, too, and fallible.

Not holding Trump accountable costs him and democracy

Texto completo: By now, 94% of Americans have made up their minds, according to a Fox News poll last week.
About 50% of Americans believe President Donald Trump committed impeachable offenses and support his removal from office. And about 44% of the country is as committed as ever to Trump. There is nothing Trump could do to shake their faith in him.
Speaking of faith, many Republicans in the U.S. House and Senate have developed a relationship with Trump that is reminiscent of something out of the Old Testament. Trump is clearly wrathful and his supporters believe he is to be revered, feared and obeyed, and no blasphemy shall pass through the faithful’s lips when speaking of him.
Just as it would be absurd to call a witness to testify against God because God is all-knowing and all-powerful, Senate and House Republican officials believed it was absurd to call witnesses to testify against Trump because Trump is omnipotent — and a very stable genius at that.
Any day now, the gospel according to Fox News will report that Trump has tweeted an updated commandment as follows, “I am the Lord thy God from Queens, thou shalt not have any other gods, or presidents, before or after me — especially not Crooked Hillary, Sleepy Joe or Nancy.”
Despite Trump’s truly impressive skill in keeping his sheeplike GOP in line, an increasing number of Americans, most of whom are independents, are growing tired of Trump and the GOP officials who cower before their master.
The military view
One such group of people, who respect authority but also believe in honor and integrity, are those in the U.S. military. By the time he left office, President Barack Obama was not highly popular among those in the military, and many hoped that Trump would reverse Obama-era troop reductions.
However, recent polling shows that Trump’s support among active-duty service members is diminishing.
Every year since 2016, The Military Times has conducted a poll of service members’ views toward President Trump. Each year it gets worse for Trump.
Currently, 45.1% view Trump “very unfavorably,” while only 24.3% view him “very favorably.”
After factoring in those who feel less strongly, the results mirror the general population — about 50% of service members have an overall unfavorable view of Trump, and about 42% have an overall favorable view.
The Military Times concludes that there are several reasons for this. First, former Secretary of Defense James Mattis was highly respected in the military, but Mattis quit the Trump administration because he could no longer be complicit in Trump’s backstabbing of our allies.
There’s also revulsion at Trump’s comments toward brave civil servants in the State Department and intelligence community with whom many military service members collaborate on a daily basis.
Lastly, most people in the military hold themselves to a high standard and most know that their commander in chief is a pretty bad example of an ethical leader.
Keep in mind that this latest poll was taken before Trump’s former chief of staff and four-star Gen. John Kelly offered his thoughts on whether former national security adviser John Bolton should testify — as he expressed a desire to do — in the Senate impeachment trial.
According to The New York Times, Bolton writes in his new book that Trump told him directly that he wanted to continue freezing military aid to Ukraine until its government helped with investigations of former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter.
Kelly’s response: “I believe John Bolton. ... He always gave the president the unvarnished truth.”
Kelly added, of the impeachment trial, “I mean half of Americans think this process is purely political and shouldn’t be happening, but since it is happening, the majority of Americans would like to hear the whole story. ... So I think if there are people that could contribute to this, either innocence or guilt ... I think they should be heard.”
As a former U.S. Army officer, I’d like to thank Kelly.
A Trump-worshiper, however, would ask Kelly: How dare you not support the president’s attempts to suppress the truth? Don’t you know that your heroic service to the nation must be trumped by your eternal fealty to your new god, the reality TV star from Queens?
Just ‘headaches’
Military service members also were outraged by Trump’s recent comments about the impact of traumatic brain injuries sustained by U.S. service members in the Jan. 8 Iranian ballistic missile strike that struck two Iraqi military bases housing coalition troops.
Trump first told us there had been no American casualties in the strike. Then we were told 11 service members had suffered concussion-like symptoms. That number grew until last week, we learned that 64 service members had been diagnosed with traumatic brain injury.
At a Jan. 22 news conference, Trump characterized the brain injuries as “headaches,” and said, “No, I don’t consider them very serious injuries, relative to other injuries that I’ve seen.”
The Veterans of Foreign Wars did not hold back.
Traumatic brain injury “is a serious injury and one that cannot be taken lightly,” VFW National Commander William “Doc” Schmitz said in a statement. “The VFW expects an apology from the president to our service men and women for his misguided remarks.”
How dare the VFW demand an apology from the president? Doesn’t that veterans organization know that Trump had bone spurs that kept him out of Vietnam? He speaks with authority about serious conditions affecting brave patriots.
Who do the members of the VFW think they are — veterans of foreign wars or something?
Surviving vs. thriving
Back to reality. Yes, an increasing number of service members now view Trump unfavorably. But so, too, does the American public at large.
The country has withstood Trump for this long but not without consequences. We survived the impeachable offenses of presidents Andrew Johnson, Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton, and we will survive Trump’s.
However, there’s a stark difference between surviving and thriving. The values upon which our Constitution was founded are being eroded. We may survive this, but in order to thrive, we need to realize what we stand for. A president who is allowed to believe he can do no wrong is not why our ancestors rebelled against King George III.
The longer Trump stays in office, the more support he’ll lose from service members and civilian women and independents. Then, when he’s a private citizen, New York Attorney General Letitia James can seek to exact the justice Americans are due.
Sometimes it takes a while, but people like Trump always go down. Trump is no god or king, despite his insistence and that of his supporters.
Trump is a masterful manipulator. What we saw on TV last week during the Senate trial was something I would have expected to see on another continent. Unbelievably, his defense counsel Alan Dershowitz asserted that “if a president does something which he believes will help him get elected in the public interest, that cannot be the kind of quid pro quo that results in impeachment.”
In other words, whatever Trump does must be seen as being good for the country because he thinks it is.
In the words of P.F. Sloan, we may not yet be on the “eve of destruction.” But if we give Trump a free pass to do whatever he wants, we certainly would be.

‘Deliberately wrenched out of context’: Dershowitz defends ‘public interest’ impeachment argument

Texto completo: Attorney Alan Dershowitz defended his controversial argument that President Trump believed his reelection was in the public interest when he called for an investigation into Joe Biden.
During the question and answer portion of the Senate impeachment trial, the Trump defense team lawyer said, “Every public official that I know believes that his election is in the public interest, and, mostly, you're right. Your election is in the public interest. And, if a president did something that he believes will help him get elected, in the public interest, that cannot be the kind of quid pro quo that results in impeachment.”
His remarks were ripped by many, including former President Bill Clinton's press secretary Joe Lockhart, who said, “This is what you hear from Stalin, this is what you hear from Mussolini, this is what you hear from Hitler, all of the authoritarian people who rationalized, in some cases genocide, based on what was in the public interest. It was startling.”
In an interview on Fox News Sunday, Dershowitz, 81, explained that he was answering a question on motive, and his remarks were misconstrued by the press.
“I was asked the question by a senator. The question was: Does quid pro quo matter? And my answer is, it matters if what the president did is illegal or wrong. But if the president did something completely lawful, the fact that part of his motivation may have been to help his election cannot be the quid pro quo,” he explained.
Tweet
Dershowitz claimed that his remarks were “deliberately wrenched out of context” by Democrats and some in the media because he was giving a strong defense of the president that could sway the final vote in favor of him.
He explained, “These folks have totally distorted, quite deliberately, because they saw that I was having an impact on some of the senators. So they deliberately distorted what I said and said, ‘Oh, even if it’s criminal, if the president thinks it's in the best interest, it can’t be an impeachable offense.’ Nonsense. I never said that. The Wall Street Journal says I never said it. The New York Times says I never said it. And the fact that Schumer and Schiff and CNN say I said it, doesn’t make it true.”
Dershowitz’s role on the president’s impeachment team has largely concluded after the Senate voted on Friday to not hear from any additional witnesses. The trial is expected to be completed on Wednesday after senators vote to acquit or convict the president.

Robert O'Brien ‘very confident’ National Security Council didn’t leak Bolton book details

Texto completo: National Security Adviser Robert O’Brien denied claims from John Bolton’s attorneys that portions of his new book were leaked by the National Security Council.
The council had been given a manuscript of John Bolton’s new book, The Room Where it Happened, to ensure that no classified information was included in the memoir. Several portions of the book leaked just as the Senate impeachment trial started, leading many senators to argue that Bolton, 71, must testify because of the allegations made in it.
In the forthcoming book, Bolton claimed that he was told by President Trump to call Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to tell him to meet with his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani to discuss an investigation into the Bidens and the fate of Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch. Both Giuliani and Trump denied Bolton's claims.
Bolton’s attorneys denied that they were responsible for the book leaking. Charles Cooper, Bolton’s lawyer, said, “It is clear, regrettably, from The New York Times article published today that the prepublication review process has been corrupted and that information has been disclosed by persons other than those properly involved in reviewing the manuscript.”
During a Sunday interview on Face the Nation, O’Brien denied Cooper’s claims, saying, “I’m very confident that the leaks of that book did not come from the NSC.”
O’Brien explained that his council would not be verifying the claims made in Bolton’s book and that it is only responsible for filtering out any confidential passages. He added, “What the president has said, at least with respect to the allegation that Ambassador Bolton made, that he told him to call Zelensky, the president has said that did not happen.”
He noted that Attorney General William Barr and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have also sided with Trump over the remarks in the book. O’Brien continued, “It’s always disappointing when someone who has access to the most confidential, close information, close relationship with the president, decides to leave the White House and do a tell-all book.”
The leaked portions of Bolton’s book left many Democrats calling for additional witness testimony in the Senate trial, but the Republican majority voted against hearing new testimony. The Senate will vote to convict or acquit the president on Wednesday.

Texto completo: Michael Bloomberg is a moderate! Or so we're told.
Yes, he might have no regard for the civil liberties of black people, want to ban everything from sodas to mint-flavored Juul pods, and be a creepy sexist, but at least the former New York City mayor and 2020 Democratic presidential candidate offers voters a moderate alternative, right? Not really.
The candidate released a proposal on Saturday to raise taxes — by $5 trillion. According to Jon Levine of the New York Post, the plan includes “rolling back President Trump’s corporate tax cuts; a new 5% surtax on incomes above $5 million a year; taxes on capital gains; lowering the threshold for the estate tax; and restoring top rates back to the Obama-era 39.6%.”
To put this in perspective, $5 trillion is a lot of money. The entire federal budget right now is roughly $4.5 trillion. But among a field of far-left Democratic candidates such as Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, a mere $5 trillion in tax hikes makes Bloomberg a moderate, at least relatively speaking.
The New York Times categorized his tax proposal as “less aggressive than those from his most liberal rivals for the Democratic presidential nomination.” The paper offered this description in part because Bloomberg did not endorse the same sweeping, arguably unconstitutional “wealth tax” many of his competitors have proposed. Additionally, the sheer total of his $5 trillion tax hikes, while whopping, is markedly less than that proposed by Sanders, $16 trillion, or Warren’s tax plan, which includes $26 trillion in increases.
Yup, that’s right: When you compare Bloomberg to other top Democrats such as Warren and Sanders, a $5 trillion tax hike is now “moderate.” That’s the Democratic Party in 2020 for you, folks.

Texto completo: Washington • During a meeting with Donald Trump at Trump Tower in June 2016, with the opéra bouffe builder improbably heading toward the nomination despite a skeletal campaign crew on a floor below, I asked when he would pivot.
We all assumed he would have to pivot, that he would have to stop his belittling Twitter rants, that he would have to cease attacking fellow Republicans like John McCain, that he would have to get more in line with the traditional stances of his party, that he would have to be less of a barbarian at the gates of D.C.
He crossed his arms, pursed his lips and shook his head — a child refusing vegetables.
How naive he was, I thought to myself. But I was the naive one. Trump has forced the world to pivot to him.
The state of the union is upside down and inside out and sauerkraut. Trump has changed literally everything in the last three years, transforming and coarsening the game. On Friday night, he became, arguably, the most brutishly powerful Republican of all time. Never has a leader had such a stranglehold on his party, subsuming it with one gulp.
As the Senate voted 51-49 to smother the impeachment inquiry, guided by the dark hand of Mitch McConnell, it felt like the world’s greatest deliberative body had been hollowed out, diminished.
McConnell let Mitt Romney and Susan Collins vote to allow documents and witnesses such as John Bolton, knowing two could strain at the leash safely.
The rest of the senators fell into line as sycophantic clones of Mike Pence. The impeachment trial amounted to one side being earnest and one pretending to be. It was exactly what Nancy Pelosi feared would happen before she was reluctantly drawn into the show trial.
“Now the State of the Union is going to be the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man coming down the street and standing in the rubble of what’s left of the Congress,” keened one Democrat on Friday night. “The Republican Party has now lost whatever control they could exert over this president, any oversight they could have. It’s gone. The state of the union is there is no union. How can there be when one side is petrified of their Godzilla?”
Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., dismissed Republicans as “a cult of personality” around Trump.
“This trial in so many ways crystallized the completely diametrically opposed threats that Democrats and Republicans see to the country,” Murphy told Nicholas Fandos of The New York Times. “We perceive Donald Trump and his corruption to be an existential threat to the country. They perceive the deep state and the liberal media to be an existential threat to the country.
“That dichotomy, that contrast, has been growing over the last three years, but this trial really crystallized that difference. We were just speaking different languages, fundamentally different languages when it came to what this trial was about. They thought it was about the deep state and the media conspiracy. We thought it was about the president’s crimes.”
I feel like I have spent my career watching the same depressing dynamic that unspooled Friday night: Democrats trying, sometimes ineptly, to play fair, and Republicans ruthlessly trying to win.
I watched it with the Anita Hill-Clarence Thomas hearings. I watched it in the 2000 recount with Bush versus Gore. I watched it with the push by W., Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld to go to war in Iraq. I watched it with the pantomime of Merrick Garland.
Democrats are warning Republicans that they will be judged harshly by history. But in the meantime, the triumphant Republicans get to make history. And a lot of the history that Republicans have made is frightening: the endless, futile wars, the obliviousness to climate change, the stamp on the judiciary.
As Carl Hulse of The Times writes in his book, “Confirmation Bias,” about the Garland fiasco: “The success in naming judges was the signal achievement of Trump’s first two years. In the coming years, those judges will be among the members of the federal bench called to rule on Trump’s policies and practices in cases arising from challenges initiated by increasingly confrontational Democrats and other legal adversaries around the nation. Mitch McConnell made a snap decision one night in 2016. The consequences will reverberate for decades.”
For hours Friday, the House managers made their vain final arguments. Pressing for Bolton’s testimony, Val Demings implored Republican senators: Aren’t you worried that, if left in office, Trump will harm America’s national security, seek to corrupt the upcoming election and undermine our democracy to further his own personal gain? Don’t you want to hear the witnesses and see the documents that would give the full story and make this a fair trial rather than a mock one?
“This is the American way and this is the American story,” Demings told the Republican senators as they looked back at her, impassive or impatient.
But, of course, they didn’t want that. As he voted against witnesses and documents, Lamar Alexander, McConnell’s pal, said Trump did something inappropriate but they just did not accept that it was impeachable, and they did not want to tear up ballots and “pour gasoline on cultural fires that are burning out there.”
So why not shut it down and cover it up? The books were cooked from the start.
As with so many other pivotal moments in modern history, Republicans wanted to win, not look for the truth. And history, God help us, is written by the winners.

Texto completo: All you have to do is beat him.
Donald Trump is not a Caesar; he does not bestride our narrow world like a colossus, undefeatable save by desperate or underhanded means. He is an instinct-driven chancer who has exploited the decadence of his party and the larger system to grasp and hold a certain kind of power.
But he is also a reckless and distracted figure, a serial squanderer of opportunities, who barely won the presidency and whose coalition is united only in partisan solidarity and fear of liberalism. He may not be removable by the impeachment process, but is not a king; he is a widely hated, legislatively constrained president facing a difficult reelection.
All you have to do is beat him.
For a long time during Trump’s ascent I wrote columns demanding that the leaders of the Republican Party do something to keep this obviously unfit, chaotic, cruel man from becoming their nominee for president. Those columns were morally correct but structurally naive, based on theories of party decision-making that no longer obtain in our era of institutional decay.
But Trump could have been stopped in the Republican primaries the old-fashioned way — by being beaten at the polls. His base was limited, his popularity fluctuated, and if his rivals had recognized the threat earlier, campaigned against him consistently, strategized with one another more effectively, and avoided their own meltdowns and missteps, there was no reason he could not have been defeated.
All you have to do is beat him.
After Trump’s administration began and immediately descended into chaos, I had one last flare of institutionalism, one last moment of outrage and 25th Amendment fantasy. But since then I have left the outrage to my liberal friends, watching them put their hopes in Robert Mueller’s investigation, in law enforcement and intelligence agency leaks and whistleblowing, and finally — though with less real hope and more grim resignation — in the House’s articles of impeachment.
Now that last effort is ending, as everyone with eyes could see it would, with the Republicans who failed to beat Trump when it counted declining to turn on him now that partisan consolidation and improving national conditions have sealed their base to him. The mix of expedience and cravenness with which the institutional GOP approached impeachment is no different than the way the institutional GOP behaved during Trump’s initial ascent, and it leaves Trump’s opposition no worse off than before. A failed impeachment doesn’t give him new powers or new popularity; it just shows that the normal way to be rid of an unpopular president is the way that Democrats must take.
All you have to do is beat him.
Of course, in trying to beat him they have to cope with the fact that he is chronically unscrupulous, as the Biden-Ukraine foray shows. And they have to overcome the advantage that his particular coalition enjoys in the Electoral College.
But in other ways the Democrats are lucky to have Trump to run against, as they were lucky in 2016. In a year when the fundamentals mildly favored Republicans, Hillary Clinton got to face off against the most-disliked GOP nominee of modern times. And she would have beaten him — even with Russia, even with Comey — had her campaign taken just a few more steps to counter his team’s long-shot strategy to flip the Midwest.
All you have to do is beat him.
As with 2016, so with politics since. Liberal hand-wringing about their structural disadvantages ignores the advantages that Trump keeps giving them — the fact that in the best economy in 20 years he can’t stop making people hate him, can’t stop missing opportunities to expand his base, can’t stop forcing vulnerable Republicans to kiss his ring and thereby weaken their own prospects.
Impeachment has only extended this pattern, with Republicans voting to shorten the trial even when it makes them look like lackeys, and too cowed in many cases to even take the acquit-but-still-condemn approach that Democrats took with Bill Clinton. So now most of the country thinks the president did something wrong, most of the country thinks Republicans are protecting him, and most of the country is open, entirely open, to voting Trump and the most vulnerable Republican senators out in nine short months.
All you have to do is beat him.
It’s worth remembering, too, that liberalism is not just struggling in America, with our Electoral College and right-tilting Senate; it is struggling all around the world. Which, again, suggests that American liberals are fortunate to have Trump as their Great Foe. If he were merely as disciplined and competent as Boris Johnson or Viktor Orban, to choose leaders with whom he has a few things in common, he would be coasting to reelection.
Instead it is very likely that he will lose. But it was likely that he would lose in 2016 as well. One essential lesson of the Trump era is that likelihoods are not enough; if you want to end the Trump era, only one thing will suffice.
You have to beat him.

Leonard Pitts: Hillary Clinton was right about those ‘deplorables’

Texto completo: Surely you remember the “basket of deplorables.”
That was Hillary Clinton's 2016 characterization of some Donald Trump supporters. Observers saw it as a major gaffe, and conservatives erupted in hot, "How dare you!" indignation at the idea there was anything deplorable about voting for a lying, racist, misogynistic, vagina-grabbing, deadbeat.
Few people, if any, dared point out the obvious. Which is that Clinton was right.
Well, welcome to déjà vu all over again. Recently on CNN, Don Lemon presided over a segment about Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who recently blew up at an NPR reporter for having the temerity to ask him about Ukraine. The reporter says Pompeo challenged her to find that country on a map, which she did. Panelist Rick Wilson, a former GOP strategist, opined that Pompeo “knows deep within his heart that Donald Trump couldn’t find Ukraine on a map if you had the letter U and a picture of an actual physical crane next to it.”
At which Lemon started laughing and could not stop. He lowered his head to the desk as Wilson and a second panelist, New York Times columnist Wajahat Ali, adopted dumb rube accents in mockery of Trump supporters.
Wilson: “Donald Trump’s the smart one — and y’all elitists are dumb!”
Ali: "'You elitists with your geography and your maps — and your spelling!"'
Trump World was predictably, if hypocritically, outraged. Lemon would later assert that he was laughing only at the initial joke and that he didn't hear — and disavows — the mockery. But the Poynter Institute, among other journalism professionals, was unpersuaded. It called Lemon's behavior "unprofessional," and added that, "Bending over and laughing until you cry while being oblivious to what your guests are doing was not a good look for Lemon. It was an even worse look for CNN."
You'll get no argument here. Lemon's attack of the tee-hee-hees reflected poorly on him, his employer and his profession.
But Lemon's response to it aside, Wilson and Ali's jokes — riffing as it does not just on Trump World's ignorance, but on its hostility to knowledge — strikes a chord. Consider an anecdote from the new book "A Very Stable Genius" by Philip Rucker and Carol Leonnig. It's about Trump's visit to a sacred American shrine, the USS Arizona Memorial at Pearl Harbor. He's on the boat, being ferried out to this iconic site, and he pulls then-Chief of Staff John Kelly aside. "Hey, John, what's this all about?" he asks. "What's this a tour of?"
Maybe if it were a one-off, you could ignore it. But from his disinterring of Frederick Douglass to the creative spellings of his tweets to his geographic gaffes (We just got back from the Middle East," he once announced — in Israel) Trump produces daily, glaring and incontrovertible evidence of his intellectual dullness.
Which, in Trump World, will cost him absolutely nothing. Small wonder. A 2015 survey by the Pew Research Center found that among Americans with college and post-graduate degrees, progressives outpace conservatives by a wide margin. In other words, the right is less well educated. In Trump, they've found someone who validates their inchoate biases and fears — and they don't much care that he doesn't know what happened at Pearl Harbor.
If you happen to be one of those crazy folks who thinks knowing stuff is good — especially on the world stage — that's frightening. And it lends a certain perspective to Lemon's lapses. Once again, a side issue takes center stage.
And the obvious goes unsaid.

Texto completo: Twelve people have died in Mississippi state prisons since the start of the new year. Nine deaths occurred in the Mississippi State Penitentiary at Parchman. At least one was a suicide. Most were a result of violence between inmates: beatings, stabbings and other fatal altercations.
State officials have promised to stop the violence. After news of two of those deaths broke last week, Gov. Tate Reeves, a Republican who took office earlier this month, said he would work “around the clock” with the state Department of Corrections to “respond immediately” and prevent new incidents “going forward.”
What’s striking about this situation is how little of it is new. The Parchman prison, which dates to 1904, has a long and infamous history of violence and abuse. It also has a history of reform. But no amount of change has been able to break the cycle of brutality. And why would it? The history of Parchman is a prime example of how dehumanization and neglect are intrinsic to separating people from their freedom.
The Mississippi of the late 19th century was a rigid apartheid state, its criminal justice system defined by cruel, gratuitous punishment. Black suspects bore the brunt of state violence. Often arrested for petty crimes like theft, gambling and “vagrancy” — traveling without a work permit or evidence of a job — black Mississippians were given hefty fines and lengthy sentences. They were then leased out to private companies for de facto slave labor on railroads and plantations. Conditions were abysmal.
“The prisoners ate and slept on bare ground, without blankets or mattresses, and often without clothes,” writes historian David Oshinsky in “Worse Than Slavery: Parchman Farm and the Ordeal of Jim Crow Justice.” “Convicts dropped from exhaustion, pneumonia, malaria, frostbite, consumption, sunstroke, dysentery, gunshot wounds, and ‘shackle poisoning’ (the constant rubbing of chains and leg irons against bare flesh).” In the 1880s, Oshinsky notes, the annual mortality rate for Mississippi’s convict population ranged from 9% to 16%.
Convict leasing was on the wane by the turn of the last century, but Mississippi’s white elite was still obsessed with “Negro crime.” Enter Gov. James K. Vardaman. Elected in 1903 on a demagogic platform of rural chauvinism and white supremacy — he promised to tax the planters, give aid to the (white) poor and turn back “social equality” — Vardaman was a kind of reformer.
He opposed convict leasing as a public giveaway to wealthy landowners and an oppressive burden on impoverished offenders, including blacks.
“Vardaman would spend a lifetime fighting to deny blacks political rights and social equality,” explains Oshinsky. “Yet he also believed that Negroes who accepted their lowly place in the human order should be protected from abuse.”
Vardaman wanted a prison that would socialize black criminals into, as Oshinsky paraphrases the idea, “proper discipline, strong work habits, and respect for white authority.” He also wanted it to turn a profit.
Under his leadership, the state cleared thousands of acres near the Yazoo-Mississippi Delta in an area called Parchman place, named after the family that had owned it for years. Workers planted crops and constructed prison buildings. The Parchman Penitentiary was born. By the 1910s it was self-sufficient, operating on the same principles as an antebellum plantation, with black convict laborers supervised by white overseers, although the share of white prisoners would increase with time.
Parchman would, in short order, become notorious for its hard labor and brutality. (Blues musician Bukka White immortalized his experience of the prison in a 1940 song, “Parchman Farm Blues.”) Inmates slept on dirt floors. Violence was common. In 1954 officials added a maximum security unit where one prisoner recalled, “They just beat the living crap out of you.” Serious reform would come after the civil rights movement with Gates v. Collier, a class-action lawsuit filed in 1971 on behalf of four inmates but constructed with testimony from hundreds of prisoners. They attested to murders, rapes, beatings and tortures; one inmate, Danny Bennett, died after he was shocked with cattle prods and left unconscious under the sun in 100-degree heat. They also spoke to poor conditions, from open sewage and polluted water supplies to “kitchens overrun with insects, rodents, and the stench of decay.” A federal judge would describe the prison as “unfit for human habitation.”
Decided for good in 1974, Gates would essentially create minimum standards for incarceration in the United States. At Parchman, this meant desegregation and civilian guards, freedom of worship, minimum living space and an end to forced labor. It also spurred the state of Mississippi to create a Department of Corrections to oversee its penal facilities.
But reform had limits. New facilities and professional staff don’t change the fact that prisons are a place of confinement, where society isolates many of its least wanted and most vulnerable members. By the 1990s, according to a report from the American Civil Liberties Union, death row prisoners at Parchman — renamed Mississippi State Penitentiary — reported “profound isolation, unrelieved idleness and monotony, denial of exercise, intolerable stench and pervasive filth, grossly malfunctioning plumbing, and constant exposure to human excrement.”
HIV-positive prisoners in the general population told lawyers from the ACLU that they “were living in squalor, categorically segregated from the rest of the prison population, and barred from all prison educational and vocational programs and jobs.” Assaults between inmates, often part of rival gangs, remained common.
Parchman is hardly alone in its history of violence and neglect. If anything, it’s just an extreme example of conditions that occur throughout American prisons. Even so, there’s worse. Last year, the Department of Justice released a 56-page report on the Alabama prison system, where guards are few and far between and where prisoners experience high rates of homicide and sexual assault, where — The New York Times reported — “one prisoner had been dead for so long that when he was discovered lying face down, his face was flattened.” The nation’s jails — local facilities where arrestees are placed pending trial or sentencing — aren’t much better. According to the most recent data, a 2015 report from the Bureau of Justice Statistics, 1,053 people died in local jails in 2014. The leading cause, suicide, accounted for 35% of those deaths.
Change, for Parchman and other facilities, will almost certainly come. We should understand, however, that reform is only ever temporary. There’s only so much you can do within the paradigm of incarceration. A prison may or may not be humane, but it will always be dehumanizing. The isolation, the lack of liberty — the separation from family and community — are antithetical to human life. In which case, the only way to “fix” a problem like the American prison system is to end it. But for an unequal, racially stratified country like ours, that destination is on the far horizon, if it’s on the horizon at all.

Texto completo: At this point, the Democratic presidential nomination is very much up in the air. Not only is it unclear who will be the nominee; it’s unclear whether the nominee will be a centrist like Joe Biden or Amy Klobuchar, or a representative of the party’s left like Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren. Whoever wins, there will be much wailing and gnashing of teeth from the other side.
So I’d like to offer an opinion that will probably anger everyone: In terms of actual policy, it probably doesn’t matter much who the Democrats nominate — as long as he or she wins, and Democrats take the Senate too.
If you’re a centrist worried about the gigantic spending increases Sanders has proposed, calm down, because they won’t happen. If you’re a progressive worried that Biden might govern like a Republican, you should also calm down, because he wouldn’t.
In practice, any Democrat would probably preside over a significant increase in taxes on the wealthy and a significant but not huge expansion of the social safety net. Given a Democratic victory, a much-enhanced version of Obamacare would almost certainly be enacted; “Medicare for All,” not so much. Given a Democratic victory, Social Security and Medicare would be protected and expanded; Paul Ryan-type cuts wouldn’t be on the table.
Why do I say this? Consider first the lessons from three years of Donald Trump.
In 2016 Trump ran as a different kind of Republican, promising that unlike other candidates, he wouldn’t slash social programs and cut taxes on the rich. But it was all a lie. Aside from his trade war, Trump’s economic policies have been straight right-wing orthodoxy: huge tax cuts for corporations and the wealthy, attempts to take health care away from tens of millions of Americans. And lately he has been talking about possible cuts to Social Security and Medicare.
The point is that even though Trump commands humiliating personal subservience from his party, he hasn’t caused any significant shift in its policy priorities.
Now, the Democratic Party is very different from the GOP — it’s a loose coalition of interest groups, not a monolithic entity answering to a handful of billionaires allied with white nationalists. But this if anything makes it even harder for a Democratic president to lead his or her party very far from its political center of gravity, which is currently one of moderate progressivism.
It’s still far from clear who will come out on top in the primary, but it’s enough to think about what would happen if either of the two current front-runners, Bernie Sanders or Joe Biden, were to become president — and also have strong enough coattails to produce a Democratic Senate, because otherwise nothing will happen.
Sanders has a hugely ambitious agenda; Medicare for All is just part of it. Paying for that agenda would be difficult — no, Modern Monetary Theory wouldn’t actually do away with the fiscal constraint. So turning Sanders’ vision into reality would require large tax increases, not just on the wealthy, but on the middle class; without those tax increases it would be highly inflationary.
But not to worry: It won’t happen. Even if he made it to the White House, Sanders would have to deal with a Congress (and a public) considerably less radical than he is and would be obliged to settle for a more modest progressive agenda.
It’s true that Sanders enthusiasts believe that they can rally a hidden majority of Americans around an aggressively populist agenda and in so doing also push Congress into going along. But we had a test in the midterm elections: Progressives ran a number of candidates in Trump districts, and if even one of them had won they would have claimed vindication for their faith in transformative populism. But none did; the sweeping Democratic victory came entirely from moderates running conventional campaigns.
The usual take on this progressive setback is that it raises questions about Sanders’ electability. But it also has a very different implication: Moderates worried about a radical presidency should cool it. A President Sanders wouldn’t be especially radical in practice.
What about Biden? The Sanders campaign has claimed that Biden endorsed Ryan’s plans for sharp cuts in Social Security and Medicare; that claim is false. What is true is that in the past Biden has often been a Very Serious Person going along with the Beltway consensus that we need “adjustments” — a euphemism for at least modest cuts — in Social Security. (Actually, if you go back a ways, Sanders turns out to have said similar things.)
But the Democratic Party as a whole has moved left on these issues, and Biden has moved with it. Even if he has a lingering desire to strike a Grand Bargain with Republicans — which I doubt — he would face such a huge intraparty backlash that he would be forced to back off.
So in terms of policy, here’s what I think would happen if Sanders wins: We’ll get a significant but not gigantic expansion of the social safety net, paid for by significant new taxes on the rich.
On the other hand, if Biden wins, we’ll get a significant but not gigantic expansion of the social safety net, paid for by significant new taxes on the rich.
One implication, if I’m right, is that electability should play a very important role in your current preferences. It matters hugely whether a Democrat wins; it matters much less which Democrat wins.
But my main point is that Democrats should unify, enthusiastically, behind whoever gets the nomination. Any moderate tempted to become a Never Bernie type should realize that even if you find Sanders too radical, his actual policies would be far more tempered. Any Sanders enthusiast tempted to become a Bernie or Bust type should realize that these days even centrist Dems are pretty progressive, and that there’s a huge gap between them and Trump’s GOP.
Oh, and all the Democrats believe in democracy and rule of law, which is kind of important these days.

Texto completo: Coronavirus is starting to freak me out — not the illness itself but the amped-up, ill-considered way our frightened world might respond to it.
Yes, the novel virus appears to be spreading quickly at the outbreak’s epicenter in the Chinese province of Hubei, but after a late start the Chinese government is now imposing unprecedented measures to contain it. As the World Health Organization declared last week, it remains too early to call the outbreak a global public health emergency.
So far, the Wuhan coronavirus is not much more frightening than the outbreaks of other recent coronaviruses like SARS in 2003 or MERS in 2012, each of which killed fewer than a thousand people around the world. The new virus’s death toll has just exceeded 130; for context, according to the CDC, about 15 million Americans have been sickened by the seasonal flu so far in the 2019-2020 flu season, and 8,200 have died from it. (The flu kills between 300,000 and 650,000 people around the world annually.)
What worries me more than the new disease is that fear of a vague and terrifying new illness might spiral into panic and that it might be used to justify unnecessarily severe limits on movement and on civil liberties, especially of racial and religious minorities around the world.
I also worry that the online world may give rise to dangerous skepticism and that in the event of an actual pandemic a large number of people may delay treatment or refuse vaccines because they don’t believe the science or are suspicious of the government.
“I predict that the next major outbreak — whether of a highly fatal strain of influenza or something else — will not be due to a lack of preventive technologies,” warned Heidi Larson, the director of the Vaccine Confidence Project, in a 2018 article in the journal Nature. “Instead, emotional contagion, digitally enabled, could erode trust in vaccines so much as to render them moot.” Social media, she added, “should be recognized as a global public-health threat.”
Tech giants have been racing to tamp down conspiracy theories and hoaxes about the Wuhan virus, but I worry that their efforts won’t be very successful, because society seems to have no good answer to the kind of emotional contagion Larson describes. It’s not just that many people get their news from a medium given to rumor, exaggeration and wild misinformation, especially on issues about health or science — see the persistence of anti-vaxers or climate-change deniers. There is also a growing partisan divide over how Americans interpret scientific expertise and health policy, leaving decisions about public health vulnerable to the kind of partisan squabbling you hear on cable news every night.
I also worry about the hair-trigger state of geopolitics. From Donald Trump to Xi Jinping to Boris Johnson, strongmen with authoritarian tendencies run many of the world’s most powerful governments. It is worth remembering that disease, or the fear of disease, can bring out the worst in humanity — pandemics often feed scapegoating (Jews were widely blamed for the Black Death), creating a fertile field for demagogues. When you put all these factors together, you’ve got a dangerous recipe for global repression.
Already, China’s response appears to be driven by political considerations more than epidemiological ones. The government has imposed a travel lockdown on more than 35 million people, which experts say is a quarantine of unprecedented size and scale, yet it may not even turn out to be very effective. Experts say that quarantines work best during the earliest stages of an outbreak but that they can also backfire, causing medical shortages, corroding trust in health officials and pushing some people to look to evade care to escape any restriction on their rights. China took weeks to mount a full-scale response to the virus. According to Wuhan’s mayor, 5 million people left the city before restrictions were imposed, suggesting the country is effectively locking the barn door after the horse has run off.
“They’re doing it because people who are in political leadership always think that if you do something dramatic and visible that you’ll gain popular support,” Lawrence Gostin, a professor of global health law at Georgetown University, told The Washington Post. “They couldn’t have any sound public health advice.”
We should keep this sense of caution in mind in case American politicians begin pushing for travel bans, overbroad quarantines or other measures that might not be supported by the science.
You might wonder what the great harm is — if the government needs to temporarily limit people’s movements or prevent some people from entering the country, shouldn’t it take those measures in the face of dangerous illness? Perhaps, but given the checkered history of quarantines — throughout history, they have been used to persecute the marginalized — lawmakers and the media should rigorously examine the bases for any such restrictions. We should especially make sure any restrictions imposed are indeed temporary and adhere to the science — something we don’t always do. Consider that 30 years after the AIDS outbreak, men who have sex with men are still restricted from donating blood in the United States, long after the scientific basis for such a ban has passed.
So far, President Donald Trump has offered a measured response to the virus. “We have it totally under control,” he said this week. But online, misinformation about the scale of the virus is already trending. (It is not, as you might have read on Twitter, “thermonuclear pandemic level bad.”) So are racist memes blaming Chinese people and Chinese culture for the virus.
I fear that the conditions are ripe for a situation similar to what occurred in the summer of 2014, when an outbreak of Ebola overran West Africa. After the Obama administration scrambled to bring home two American health workers who had become infected with the disease in Liberia, Trump went on a monthslong Twitter tirade about Ebola.
The future president favored extreme isolationism, seeing no benefit to American help in Africa. “People that go to far away places to help out are great-but must suffer the consequences!” he wrote — ultimately sparking a growing partisan movement against the government’s response to the virus.
Today, Trump runs an administration that is hemorrhaging scientific expertise, and his political agenda is rife with efforts to target immigrants, minorities and the poor. In 2016, a terrorist attack prompted Trump to propose banning Muslims from the country; when he won the White House, he instituted a version of that ban.
I fear that panic about a foreign virus offers society another chance to target marginalized people. So let’s keep our fear in check; panic will hurt us far more than it’ll help.

Texto completo: To understand how some companies have lost their souls, consider what happened after U.S. Bank stiffed a customer before Christmas.
Marc Eugenio had deposited a $1,080 paycheck into his account at U.S. Bank. The bank put a hold on most of the sum, and he spent many hours in a branch office over two days, trying to get access to the money so he could buy presents for his 9-year-old daughter and 13-year-old son.
On Christmas Eve, Eugenio found himself parked at a gas station in Clackamas, Oregon, a Portland suburb, both his fuel gauge and his bank balance on empty. A bank employee had told him that money would soon show up in his account — perhaps a ruse to get him out of the branch office. For hours Eugenia then tried his debit card at the gas pump so he could buy a few gallons and get home to his wife and children.
“I was stranded,” he told me. “I could have walked home, but it would have been 5 miles in the cold.”
That’s when Eugenio found an angel.
He telephoned the bank’s toll-free number and spoke with Emily James, a senior officer at a call center in Portland. She spent an hour on the phone with Eugenio, trying to get some money released so he could at least get home. She soon realized that he had been misled, and that money wouldn’t reach his account any time soon. Feeling bad for a customer stuck on Christmas Eve, James offered to drive over from her call center and personally hand him $20.
“No, no, no,” Eugenio told her. He couldn’t impose. But she suggested she could use her break, and she received permission from a supervisor to drive 20 minutes to Eugenio. She later recalled that when she arrived, she wished him Merry Christmas and handed him $20 of her own money.
“Twenty dollars wouldn’t break me,” she explained to me, “and it would enable him to get home to his family.”
When U.S. Bank found out that it had such a generous employee, what did it do? It fired her.
“She broke the rules, putting herself and the bank at unnecessary risk,” U.S. Bank said in a statement. The company bars call center workers from meeting customers, so it dismissed both her and the manager who had approved her trip. The manager, Abigail Gilbert, told me that James’ account was essentially correct.
James had worked at the bank since 2017 and had received numerous commendations and awards that I examined, but the bank paid her no severance. She is single and used her last paycheck to buy sacks of food for her two dogs, Domino and Harley Quinn. She is now reduced to selling blood plasma, at $25 a visit.
“I won’t let myself be homeless,” she told me.
Eugenio is horrified at what happened. “I was lied to and treated like dirt” by the bank, Eugenio said, and he can’t understand why the bank axed the one employee who was helpful. “I felt really bad,” he told me. “How could she get fired?”
U.S. Bank’s vision statement boasts: “Our employees are empowered to do the right thing.” So I tried to ask the company’s CEO, Andrew Cecere, why the bank fired an employee who, with permission, rescued a frustrated customer on Christmas Eve.
Cecere wouldn’t return my calls. David Palombi, a bank spokesman, told me that an internal “investigation” had concluded that James misled Gilbert to get permission, that James could have found other ways to get money to Eugenio, that the $20 came from the manager (which Gilbert confirmed to me) and that James previously had disciplinary “issues.” I found the bank’s “investigation” a whitewash and its explanations to be incoherent, meanspirited and contradicted by a series of internal bank messages that I reviewed.
The bottom line is this: Cecere, who was paid $14.1 million in 2018, presides over a company that has smeared a much-decorated employee who helped a customer and as a result survives by selling blood plasma. I suggest Cecere apologize, reinstate James and promote her; he might also show contrition by selling his own blood plasma and donating the proceeds to a charity of James’ choosing.
When young Americans say in polls that they react more positively to “socialism” than to “capitalism,” it’s because of the hypocrisy of institutions like U.S. Bank.
I’ve often noted that companies have enormous capacity to help their communities. But too often they act like U.S. tobacco companies, which killed more people than Stalin did, or pharma companies peddling opioids, or McKinsey & Co. advising a business to “get more patients on higher doses of opioids,” or Boeing mocking regulators. That’s one reason to seek stronger private-sector labor unions: At least unions and corporations can then provide some check on each other.
One bit of reassurance: Some chief executives do seem more enlightened than Cecere. After The Oregonian wrote two excellent articles about James, other companies reached out to her, saying that she’s the kind of caring person they want to attract.
“No job offers yet,” she told me, “but there are a couple of possibilities I’m really excited by.”
Update: On Saturday evening, after this article went online, I had a contrite phone call from Andrew Cecere, the C.E.O. of U.S. Bank. “This is not who we are,” he said. He added that companies sometimes make mistakes, and that he accepted ownership of what went wrong. He also telephoned Emily James and expressed concern for her and for her supervisor, Abigail Gilbert. “I will fix this,” he told me.

Texto completo: Kathryn Smith, general director of Madison Opera, is always in search of new operas to stage in Madison. And when she saw Minnesota Opera put on "Fellow Travelers" in the spring of 2018, she fell in love with it.
"I was in tears when it was over," Smith said. "It was just one of those pieces where I thought, 'OK, we're doing this.'"
Madison Opera is performing it twice this weekend in the Overture Center's Capitol Theater: Friday night and the afternoon of Feb. 9.
Smith said she knew it would be perfect for Madison and wound up programming it within a couple of months. She hired the Minnesota production's director, lead singer and some supporting cast members, and even rented the same physical set.
Based on a 2007 novel by Thomas Mallon, "Fellow Travelers" was first performed in 2016 by the Cincinnati Opera and was picked up quickly by other opera companies.
The opera is set in Washington, D.C., in the 1950s during the "Lavender Scare," the federal government's decades-long effort to out gay and lesbian employees and get rid of them.
In the Madison production, Andres Acosta, who goes by "Andy," reprises his Minnesota role, playing Timothy Laughlin, who, fresh out of college at the height of the McCarthy era, admires anti-communist Wisconsin Sen. Joseph McCarthy.
Tim is drawn to Hawkins ("Hawk") Fuller, a State Department official, and their same-sex relationship becomes fraught with fear and lies.
"The easiest way to describe how engaging this piece is, is that every time I speak with someone that has seen it for the first time, they say that they get to intermission and their mind is blown," Acosta said.
He said the other feedback he hears is that not a second is wasted, and part of that, he said, is due to many costume changes on stage.

Madison Opera debuts
Smith called Acosta "phenomenal" in the role of Tim.
Acosta, who is based in Indianapolis, said it's a dream to work with the same director, Peter Rothstein, in the same opera. Both are making their Madison Opera debuts.
Rothstein got a master's degree in directing from UW-Madison in 1992 and six years later co-founded his own theater company in Minneapolis called Theater Latté Da, where he still serves as artistic director. Theater Latté Da does music theater exclusively: opera, musical and dance-driven works.
Acosta said he admires Rothstein, and getting to perform the Tim role a second time allows him to "dig deeper." Acosta said he's more comfortable with the character and the music now. Ben Edquist, who debuted at Madison Opera's annual Opera in the Park this past summer, sings Hawk, Tim's love interest, and is new to the role.

Personal story
The Tim role is one Acosta said he'd love to sing as many times as possible, because, as a gay man, the story feels personal to him.
"It's a story that I think a lot of people need to hear," he said. "I feel like we should be doing more queer pieces and be bringing light to queer history that we really haven't spoken about much in this country."
In December, Acosta, 27, celebrated two years of marriage with his husband. "Fellow Travelers" was his first portrayal of a gay character so prominent to a story.
Acosta said that while the opera's concept was a familiar one, he didn't know about the Lavender Scare - he wasn't taught about it in school. "I'm very happy that this opera is being done a lot. We haven't done justice in talking about the injustice that existed during this time for the queer community."
In the libretto, Tim, an Irish Catholic, battles the stigma surrounding his sexual orientation. "That's something that's very personal to me, this theme of guilt for something that feels so right," Acosta said. "But all of society has always told (Tim) that is very, very wrong."
Acosta said he was also raised Catholic, but calls himself "spiritual" now, not religious. That's in line with Tim's journey in "Fellow Travelers."
"In the fifth scene of this show, he has an aria about how he lost his virginity the night before, and how that sort of challenges the institution of religion," he said.
Acosta said one of his earlier relationships was "pretty toxic," similar in some ways to the Hawk and Tim dynamic. "I think a lot of men in the gay community can on some level identify with that."
In a January 2018 review of a New York City production, a New York Times reviewer lauded the originality of composer Gregory Spears' score, calling it "boldly quirky" and "richly evocative," and described the opera as "wrenching" and "sadly timely."
The reviewer praises librettist Greg Pierce for the "dramatic urgency of the opera, which unfolds as a series of short, telling scenes, some of which overlap effectively."
Acosta said he agrees that the opera feels original. "Both Gregs, the composer and the librettist, really took Thomas Mallon's novel and brought something to opera that we haven't really seen, truthfully, both musically and in the way that it's set. The story itself is one that the opera community has really wanted to see for a long time. It just hasn't been done."

Dynamic company
Smith, the Madison Opera's general director, said modern operas need to have "an emotional through line," which "Fellow Travelers" does. "Most great operas are pretty much about love and betrayal and those great emotions," she said.
Even though "Fellow Travelers" is fictional, she said, it's set in a not-too-far-distant American past, a real period in American history. The Joseph McCarthy character is in one scene of the opera, but he influences the whole of it.
To Smith, it's one of the great new operas, and she said it's important for Madison Opera to do both classic and modern works. Its 2019-2020 season has shown considerable range by putting on "La Traviata" - which was shocking and new when first performed in 1853 - in the fall, and doing "Fellow Travelers" three months later.
"The definition of a dynamic opera company is that the repertoire keeps growing and you don't neglect the classics, but you expand with the newer pieces, too," she said.
"Opera has the ability to use music not only to manipulate you; it has the ability to use music to bring out emotion," Smith said. "I think this piece does that very well."

Leonard Pitts: The obvious goes unsaid

Texto completo: Surely you remember the “basket of deplorables.”
That was Hillary Clinton’s 2016 characterization of some Donald Trump supporters. Observers saw it as a major gaffe, and conservatives erupted in hot, “How dare you!” indignation at the idea there was anything deplorable about voting for a lying, racist, misogynistic, vagina-grabbing, deadbeat.
Few people, if any, dared point out the obvious. Which is that Clinton was right.
<img class="size-full wp-image-2657490" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2019/02/Leonard-Pitts-Color.jpg" alt="" width="290" height="193" />
Well, welcome to déjà vu all over again. Recently on CNN, Don Lemon presided over a segment about Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who recently blew up at an NPR reporter for having the temerity to ask him about Ukraine. The reporter says Pompeo challenged her to find that country on a map, which she did. Panelist Rick Wilson, a former GOP strategist, opined that Pompeo “knows deep within his heart that Donald Trump couldn’t find Ukraine on a map if you had the letter U and a picture of an actual physical crane next to it.”
At which Lemon started laughing and could not stop. He lowered his head to the desk as Wilson and a second panelist, New York Times columnist Wajahat Ali, adopted dumb rube accents in mockery of Trump supporters.
Wilson: “Donald Trump’s the smart one — and y’all elitists are dumb!”
Ali: “‘You elitists with your geography and your maps — and your spelling!’”
Trump World was predictably, if hypocritically, outraged. Lemon would later assert that he was laughing only at the initial joke and that he didn’t hear — and disavows — the mockery. But the Poynter Institute, among other journalism professionals, was unpersuaded. It called Lemon’s behavior “unprofessional,” and added that, “Bending over and laughing until you cry while being oblivious to what your guests are doing was not a good look for Lemon. It was an even worse look for CNN.”
You’ll get no argument here. Lemon’s attack of the tee-hee-hees reflected poorly on him, his employer and his profession.
But Lemon’s response to it aside, Wilson and Ali’s jokes — riffing as it does not just on Trump World’s ignorance, but on its hostility to knowledge — strikes a chord. Consider an anecdote from the new book “A Very Stable Genius” by Philip Rucker and Carol Leonnig. It’s about Trump’s visit to a sacred American shrine, the USS Arizona Memorial at Pearl Harbor. He’s on the boat, being ferried out to this iconic site, and he pulls then-Chief of Staff John Kelly aside. “Hey, John, what’s this all about?” he asks. “What’s this a tour of?”
Maybe if it were a one-off, you could ignore it. But from his disinterring of Frederick Douglass to the creative spellings of his tweets to his geographic gaffes (We just got back from the Middle East,” he once announced — in Israel) Trump produces daily, glaring and incontrovertible evidence of his intellectual dullness.
Which, in Trump World, will cost him absolutely nothing. Small wonder. A 2015 survey by the Pew Research Center found that among Americans with college and post-graduate degrees, progressives outpace conservatives by a wide margin. In other words, the right is less well educated. In Trump, they’ve found someone who validates their inchoate biases and fears — and they don’t much care that he doesn’t know what happened at Pearl Harbor.
If you happen to be one of those crazy folks who thinks knowing stuff is good — especially on the world stage — that’s frightening. And it lends a certain perspective to Lemon’s lapses. Once again, a side issue takes center stage.
And the obvious goes unsaid.

Kristof: Coronavirus spreads, and world pays for China’s dictatorship

Texto completo: China’s leaders sometimes seem 10 feet tall, presiding over a political and economic juggernaut that has founded universities at a rate of one a week and that recently used more cement in three years than the United States did in the entire 20th century.
President Donald Trump has hailed China’s president, Xi Jinping, as a “brilliant leader,” and Michael Bloomberg says Xi is “not a dictator.” But we’re now seeing the dangers of Xi’s authoritarian model, for China and the world.
The first known coronavirus infection in the city of Wuhan presented symptoms beginning on Dec. 1, and by late December there was alarm in Wuhan’s medical circles. That would have been the moment for the authorities to act decisively.
And act decisively they did — not against the virus, but against whistleblowers who were trying to call attention to the public health threat. A doctor who told a WeChat group about the virus was disciplined by the Communist Party and forced to admit wrongdoing. The police reported giving “education” and “criticism” to eight front-line doctors for “rumormongering” about the epidemic; instead of punishing these doctors, Xi should have listened to them.
China informed the World Health Organization of the virus on Dec. 31 but kept its own citizens in the dark; as other countries reported infections even as China pretended that it had confined the outbreak to Wuhan, Chinese joked grimly about a “patriotic” virus that only struck foreigners.
Wuhan’s mayor said he wasn’t authorized to discuss the virus until late this month. In that time, people traveled to and from Wuhan and didn’t take precautions.
The government finally ordered a lockdown on Jan. 23 that effectively quarantined people in Wuhan. But by then, according to the mayor, 5 million people had already fled the city.
Partly because the government covered up the epidemic in the early stages, hospitals were not able to gather supplies, and there are now major shortages of testing kits, masks and protective gear. Some doctors were reduced to making goggles out of plastic folders.
One reason for the early cover-up is that Xi’s China has systematically gutted institutions like journalism, social media, nongovernmental organizations, the legal profession and others that might provide accountability. These institutions were never very robust in China, but on and off they were tolerated until Xi came along.
I conducted a series of experiments on Chinese blogs over the years beginning in 2003 and was sometimes surprised by what I could get away with — but no longer. Xi has dragged China backward in terms of civil society, crushing almost every wisp of freedom and oversight.
For the same reason that Xi’s increasingly authoritarian China bungled the coronavirus outbreak, it also mishandled a swine flu virus that since 2018 has devastated China’s hog industry and killed almost one-quarter of the world’s pigs.
Dictators often make poor decisions because they don’t get accurate information: When you squelch independent voices you end up getting just flattery and optimism from those around you. Senior Chinese officials have told me that they are routinely lied to on trips to meet local officials and must dispatch their drivers and secretaries to assess the truth and gauge the real mood.
For this or other reasons, Xi has made a series of mistakes. He mishandled and inflamed the political crisis in Hong Kong, he inadvertently assured the reelection of his nemesis as president of Taiwan, and he has presided over worsening relations with the United States and many other countries.
The coronavirus has already reached the Xinjiang region in the Far West of China, and one risk is that it will spread in the internment camps where China is confining about 1 million Muslims with poor sanitation and limited health care.
Viruses are challenges for any country, and it’s only fair to note that China does a better job protecting its people from measles than the U.S. does. It’s a credit to China’s system that a baby born in Beijing today has a longer life expectancy than a baby born in Washington, D.C. More broadly, the United States, which has several impoverished counties with lower life expectancy than Cambodia or Bangladesh, is in no position to lecture anyone about health.
But, with a dose of humility, let’s get over any misplaced admiration some Americans have for Xi’s authoritarian model.
The Chinese social contract has been that citizens will not get ballots but will live steadily better lives, yet China’s economy is now as weak as it has been in three decades — and the coronavirus will sap growth further. Xi is not living up to his end of the bargain, and this is seen in the anger emerging on Chinese social media despite the best efforts of censors.
I don’t know if Xi is in political trouble for his misrule, but he should be. He’s a preening dictator, and with this outbreak some citizens are paying a price.

Texto completo: I’ve never been a fan of Davos, that annual gathering of the rich and fatuous. One virtue of the pageant of preening and self-importance, however, is that it brings out the worst in some people, leading them to say things that reveal their vileness for all to see.
And so it was for Steven Mnuchin, Donald Trump’s treasury secretary. First, Mnuchin doubled down on his claim that the 2017 tax cut will pay for itself — just days after his own department confirmed that the budget deficit in 2019 was more than $1 trillion, 75% higher than it was in 2016.
Then he sneered at Greta Thunberg, the young climate activist, suggesting that she go study economics before calling for an end to investment in fossil fuels.
Well, unearned arrogance is a Trump administration hallmark — witness Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state, claiming that a respected national security reporter couldn’t find Ukraine on a map. So it may not surprise you to learn that Mnuchin was talking nonsense and that Thunberg almost certainly has it right.
One can only surmise that Mnuchin slept through his undergraduate economics classes. Otherwise he would know that every, and I mean every, major Econ 101 textbook argues for government regulation or taxation of activities that pollute the environment, because otherwise neither producers nor consumers have an incentive to take the damage inflicted by this pollution into account.
And burning fossil fuels are a huge source of environmental damage, not just from climate change but also from local air pollution, which is a major health hazard we don’t do nearly enough to limit.
The International Monetary Fund makes regular estimates of worldwide subsidies to fossil fuels — subsidies that partly take the form of tax breaks and outright cash grants, but mainly involve not holding the industry accountable for the indirect costs it imposes. In 2017 it put these subsidies at $5.2 trillion; yes, that’s trillion with a “T.” For the U.S., the subsidies amounted to $649 billion, which is about $3 million for every worker employed in the extraction of coal, oil and gas.
Without these subsidies, it’s hard to imagine that anyone would still be investing in fossil fuels.
But maybe Mnuchin thinks that the IMF should also take some courses in economics — along with the thousands of economists, including every living former Federal Reserve chair, dozens of Nobel laureates, and chief economists from both Democratic and Republican administrations, who signed an open letter calling for taxes on emissions of greenhouse gases.
In short, Greta Thunberg may be only 17, but her views are much closer to the consensus of the economics profession than those of the guy clinging to the zombie idea that tax cuts pay for themselves.
But could the economics consensus be wrong? Yes, but probably because it isn’t hard enough on fossil fuels.
On one side, a number of experts argue that standard models underestimate the risks of climate change, both because they don’t account for its disruptive effects and because they don’t put enough weight on the possibility of total catastrophe.
On the other side, estimates of the cost of reducing emissions tend to understate the role of innovation. Even modest incentives for expanded use of renewable energy led to a spectacular fall in prices over the past decade.
I still often find people — both right-wingers and climate activists — asserting that sharply reducing emissions would require a big decline in GDP. Everything we know, however, says that this is wrong, that we can decarbonize while continuing to achieve robust growth.
Given all this, however, why are people like Mnuchin and his boss Trump so adamantly pro-fossil fuel and anti-environmentalist?
Part of the answer, I believe, is that conservatives don’t want to admit that government action is ever justified. Once you concede that the government can do good by protecting the environment, people might start thinking that it can guarantee affordable health care, too.
The bigger issue, however, is sheer greed.
Given the scale of subsidies we give to fossil fuels, the industry as a whole should be regarded as a gigantic grift. It makes money by ripping off everyone else, to some extent through direct taxpayer subsidies, to a greater extent by shunting the true costs of its operations off onto innocent bystanders.
And let’s be clear: Many of those “costs” take the form of sickness and death, because that’s what local air pollution causes. Other costs take the form of “natural” disasters like the burning of Australia, which increasingly bear the signature of climate change.
In a sane world we’d be trying to shut this grift down. But the grifters — which overwhelmingly means corporations and investors, since little of that $3-million-per-worker subsidy trickles down to the workers themselves — have bought themselves a lot of political influence.
And so people like Mnuchin claim not to see anything wrong with industries whose profits depend almost entirely on hurting people. Maybe he should take a course in economics — and another one in ethics.

Texto completo: The Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary owe their first-in-the-nation status partly to circumstance. Decades ago, Iowa’s caucus was the initial step in a long, complex process that the state used to award delegates, which meant that the voting had to happen early in the year. New Hampshire was mostly trying to save money — by scheduling its primary on the same day as many annual town meetings, which were held before the spring mud season.
But circumstance has not kept Iowa and New Hampshire at the front of the line. An aggressive protection of their own self-interest has. As primaries and caucuses became a bigger part of national politics in the 1970s, officials in Iowa and New Hampshire have fought hard to stay first.
“We weren’t stupid,” Cliff Larsen, a former chairman of the Iowa Democratic Party, once said. New Hampshire passed a law saying its primary always must be the first, and Iowa has been similarly protective. “Iowa caucuses are first-in-the-nation mainly because the state insists on remaining first,” Kathie Obradovich, a prominent Iowa journalist, has said.
It’s all worked out very nicely for the two states. A typical voter in Iowa or New Hampshire has up to 20 times more influence than somebody in later-voting states, one study found. Sometimes, the two states have turned a parochial issue (ethanol) into a national priority. Local hotels, restaurants, pollsters and television and radio stations have received millions of dollars in extra business.
This system has worked out much less well for the other 48 states. They have voluntarily surrendered political influence — and allowed the presidential nominating process to become warped.
I know the usual excuse for Iowa’s and New Hampshire’s special status: That the good people there take extra care in selecting candidates. And many Iowans and New Hampshirites are good people who take their civic duty seriously.
But step back and think about how paternalistic and condescending that explanation is. The residents of New Jersey, New Mexico, Indiana, Louisiana and other late-voting states somehow aren’t sufficiently civic-minded or intelligent to choose their own presidential candidates? They always need the same two states to winnow the field?
Right now, I’m as obsessed as anyone with the early-state polls. Yet I also want to use this moment, the eve of the Iowa caucuses, to point out how bizarre the current system is — and to make a plea: The 2020 cycle should be the last time that Iowa and New Hampshire benefit at the country’s expense.
The strongest part of the case for change, of course, is the racial aspect of the current calendar. Iowa and New Hampshire are among the country’s whitest states. About 6% of their combined population is black or Asian American. Almost 87% is non-Hispanic white, compared with 60% for the country as a whole. Demographically, Iowa and New Hampshire look roughly like the America of 1870.
Julián Castro, the former presidential candidate, was right when he called out the Democratic Party’s hypocritical support for the status quo. “Iowa and New Hampshire are wonderful states with wonderful people,” Castro said. But Democrats can’t “complain about Republicans suppressing the votes of people of color, and then begin our nominating contest in two states that hardly have people of color.”
The typical defense from Iowa officials is that their state can be trusted because it once voted for a black man (Barack Obama) — which is a pretty stark bit of paternalism.
In truth, the whiteness of Iowa and New Hampshire matters. Consider that Cory Booker and Kamala Harris were doing as well as Amy Klobuchar in early polls of more diverse states; they led Pete Buttigieg in some polls. But Booker and Harris are finished, in no small part because of their struggles in Iowa and New Hampshire. Klobuchar and Buttigieg still might break out.
Or consider that a candidate with strong white support (like Bernie Sanders) could win both Iowa and New Hampshire this year. That result would create a media narrative about Joe Biden’s campaign being badly wounded, even though Biden leads among two large groups of Democratic voters: African Americans and Latinos. Those voters, however, are told to wait their turn.
Race isn’t the only problem, either. Iowa and New Hampshire are not home to a single city of more than 250,000 people. The two states also have a disproportionately large share of retirees and a smaller share of people in their 20s, 30s and 40s.
All of this skews the campaign. And it’s another form of privilege for groups that already benefit from the Senate and Electoral College — white voters, older voters and voters outside of major metropolitan areas.
It would not be hard to create a fairer system, one that aspired to treat all Americans equally. It could even retain the best aspect of Iowa and New Hampshire: the emphasis on in-person politics that a small state demands.
One or two smaller states could always go first, with the specific states rotating each cycle. (Many smaller states — like Delaware, Hawaii, Mississippi, New Mexico and Rhode Island — are diverse.) They could immediately be followed by a couple of larger states that are home to major cities.
Obviously, politicians in Iowa and New Hampshire will fight any such change, as they always have. They’ll use lofty language, about how solemnly they take their responsibilities and how the current system allows the voices of ordinary citizens to be heard. Strip away the rhetoric, though, and their argument comes down to this: We’re better than the rest of you, and we deserve special treatment forever.

Texto completo: A damning report by The New York Times details accusations of "misogyny, bullying and harassment" within the culture of lingerie company and fashion show juggernaut Victoria's Secret.
Several accusations of inappropriate conduct toward models, including supermodel Bella Hadid, were made against Ed Razek, who recently stepped down as president and chief marketing officer of Victoria's Secret parent company L Brands. The allegations include bullying, lewd comments and sexual harassment.
Leslie Wexner, founder and chief executive of L Brands, was alerted to Razek's behavior, the report says. But some women who came forward lost their Victoria's Secret modeling jobs as a result.
USA TODAY has reached out to representatives for L Brands for comment.
The report comes amid turmoil for the brand: The annual Victoria's Secret Fashion Show was canceled in November after the company announced in May it was going to "re-think" the show.
In a statement sent to the associates at the time and obtained by USA TODAY, Wexner said the show would be going in a different direction.
"Fashion is a business of change. We must evolve and change to grow. With that in mind, we have decided to re-think the traditional Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show," the statement read. "Going forward we don’t believe network television is the right fit. "
The show in recent years had been buffeted by bad publicity, bad reviews and bad numbers. The 2018 show's audience of 3. 27 million viewers was the smallest since it became a holiday season TV event in 2001, with Nielsen saying the show has lost more than half its television audience in two years.
Previously: Victoria's Secret Fashion Show officially canceled for 2019
The Times report also includes accusations that Razek made inappropriate comments to supermodel Bella Hadid at a 2018 fashion show fitting. Citing three people present and a fourth who was later told about it, the report said Razek sat on a couch, watching while Hadid was being fitted for underwear to make sure the look would be appropriate for television.
"Forget the panties," he said, according to the report. He also made a lewd comment about Hadid having "perfect" breasts. USA TODAY has reached out to Hadid's representative for comment.
Three people also told The Times that Razek touched another model's crotch through her underwear at the same fitting.
In November, Hadid opened up about lacking confidence while modeling lingerie for Victoria's Secret, a relationship that dissolved after she joined Rihannah's Savage X Fenty lingerie brand.
"Rihanna’s amazing. For me, that was the first time on a runway that I felt really sexy," Hadid said. "When I first did Fenty, I was doing other lingerie shows and I never felt powerful on a runway, like, in underwear. "
The younger sister of supermodel sister Gigi Hadid modeled in Victoria Secret's fashion show three times, most recently in November 2018, where she donned multiple looks.
The difference? "With Rihanna's show, she was like, 'Walk whatever way you want to walk,' " Hadid said.

Texto completo: My husband and I were psychological opposites. I’ve always seen the glass as half full; to him it was half empty. That difference, research findings suggest, is likely why I pursue good health habits with a vengeance while he was far less inclined to follow the health-promoting lifestyle I advocated.
I’m no cockeyed optimist, but I’ve long believed that how I eat and exercise, as well as how I view the world, can benefit my mental and physical well-being.
An increasing number of recent long-term studies has linked greater optimism to a lower risk of developing cardiovascular disease and other chronic ailments and to fostering “exceptional longevity,” a category one team of researchers used for people who live to 85 and beyond.
Admittedly, the relationship between optimism and better health and a longer life is still only a correlation that doesn’t prove cause and effect. But there is also now biological evidence to suggest that optimism can have a direct effect on health, which should encourage both the medical profession and individuals to do more to foster optimism as a potential health benefit.
According to Dr. Alan Rozanski, one of the field’s primary researchers, “It’s never too early and it’s never too late to foster optimism. From teenagers to people in their 90s, all have better outcomes if they’re optimistic.”
Rozanski is a cardiologist at Mount Sinai St. Luke’s Hospital in New York who became interested in optimism while working in a cardiac rehab program early in his career.
“Many heart-attack patients who had long been sedentary would come into the gym and say ‘I can’t do that!’ But I would put them on the treadmill, start off slowly and gradually build them up,” he said. “Their attitude improved, they became more confident. One woman in her 70s said her heart attack may have been the best thing that had happened to her because it transformed what she thought she could do.”
In a major analysis of 15 studies involving 229,391 participants published in September in JAMA Network Open, Rozanski and colleagues found that people who ranked high in optimism were much less likely to have a heart attack or other cardiovascular event and had a lower mortality rate from any cause than did pessimistic participants in the studies.
“The data are very consistent,” he said. “In every case, there was a strong relationship between optimism and a lower risk of disease. Optimists tend to take better care of their health. They’re more likely to exercise and eat better and are less likely to smoke.”
Rozanski added, “There’s also a biological effect. Pessimists bathe their bodies in damaging stress hormones like cortisol and norepinephrine all day long. Pessimism increases inflammation in the body and fosters metabolic abnormalities like diabetes. Pessimism is also on the way to depression, which the American Heart Association considers a risk factor for cardiovascular disease.”

Why the Democratic Majority Hasn't Emerged; The party's geographic concentration causes candidates to lose touch and become complacent.

Texto completo: The Democrats lost to Donald Trump and may do it again. How did the world's oldest political party, which has won four of the past seven presidential elections and received popular-vote pluralities in two more, find itself in this pickle?
One symptom of the party's ailment is that its four top-polling presidential candidates in national surveys are in their 70s and No. 5 is a 38-year-old former mayor of a city of 102,000. Why haven't others risen? Where are the candidates with demonstrated appeal to critical segments of the electorate? One answer is that over the past decade the Democrats have had a tough time electing candidates beyond heavily Democratic constituencies.
The decision to enact ObamaCare in 2010 despite its obvious unpopularity—forced through by Speaker Nancy Pelosi over President Obama's doubts—not only cost Democrats the House but helped prevent the election of Democratic senators and governors in marginal states and produced Republican legislative majorities that dominated redistricting after the 2010 census. It may be reasonable for a party to risk seats to achieve a major policy goal. But the 2010 losses were massive, and current Democratic complaints about health care suggest ObamaCare hasn't been a policy success.
The Democratic Party has always been a coalition of out-groups. For almost a century after the Civil War it was an awkward alliance of Southern segregationists and Catholic immigrants. Until the 1930s, it had a hard time finding plausible presidential candidates because most of its prominent officeholders were Southerners or Catholics, then considered unelectable nationally. But in 1932 they had a New York governor who was firmly Protestant and a fifth cousin of the popular Republican President Theodore Roosevelt.
Today, with its four top contenders from the heavily Democratic Northeast—Delaware, Vermont, Massachusetts, New York—it has a similar problem. Delaware and Vermont were competitive states when Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders first sought office in the 1970s. But neither man has faced a competitive statewide race in decades.
Representing a one-party constituency tends to breed habits of complacency, which have been exacerbated by widely circulated prophecies that demographic changes will give the Democrats a reliable national majority. A careful reading of these "ascendant America" prophets—Ruy Teixeira and John Judis in 2002, the Atlantic's Ron Brownstein and pollster Stanley Greenberg more recently—makes clear that these trends don't operate automatically.
To prosper from demographic change, a party has to address the issues of the day convincingly and field candidates with appropriate strengths. It also needs to avoid unnecessarily alienating old constituencies. An acquaintance with history shows that when a party gains support from one growing group, the opposition party can gain even more from groups with opposing views even if they're getting smaller.
That's what happened in 2016. Rising percentages of Hispanics and Asians and the increasing liberalism of college graduates and unmarried women were supposed to help carry Hillary Clinton to easy victory. Instead they were offset by sharp declines in Democratic support from white voters without college degrees in Rust Belt states from Pennsylvania through Iowa, and in Florida with its many Rust Belt retirees. And as the New York Times's Nate Cohn argued persuasively that year, noncollege whites are a significantly larger share of the electorate than exit polls have indicated—even if their numbers are slowly declining.
Democratic strategists—especially whoever advised Hillary Clinton to attack voters as "deplorables"—seem to have assumed that noncollege whites in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin and Iowa would continue to vote as heavily Democratic as they had between 1992 and 2012. That made some sense: Recent elections had shown unusually small changes in partisan preferences. But the "blue wall" in these states was never very high, and treating voters with contempt was no way to shore it up.
The assumption was that the Democrats could keep these voters in line with promises of economic redistribution, appeals to the little guy, and attacks on big corporations. But 21st-century Democratic presidential candidates have raised and spent more money than Republicans and have run even with or ahead of them among the highest-income voters. Target-state voters may feel confident that Democrats will raise taxes on the rich, but they doubt benefits will flow to them. They might have noticed that the costs of subsidized college and health care have exploded over the years, while food and clothing, left to the market, have gotten cheaper. And for voters with modest incomes, cultural issues may be more important than economic self-interest. The same is true for affluent supporters of abortion and gay rights.
Democrats—voters as well as politicians—suffer from cultural insularity. Social psychologist Jonathan Haidt and his colleagues have shown that conservatives are better at understanding liberal views than the converse. That's not surprising: Whereas liberal views permeate the news media and popular culture, liberals can easily avoid exposure to conservative views. That distorts their view of the world and produces oversensitivity to leftist social-media mobs along with overconfidence in demographic trends.
All this tends to heighten the geographic overconcentration of Democratic votes in central cities, university towns and some suburbs. Republicans are spread more evenly. For the first time in American history, the most populous state is a political outlier. Mrs. Clinton's 2016 margin in California was 30 points.
A party with such concentrated support is at a disadvantage in the Senate and the Electoral College, as well as in the House and state legislatures, especially when the other party controls the redistricting process. The last two presidents were re-elected with 51% of the popular vote. But George W. Bush carried 255 congressional districts, Barack Obama only 209.
Faced with this disadvantage, some Democrats are talking about rewriting the rules to abolish or bypass the Electoral College. Others want to do away with equal representation of the states in the Senate, although under Article V of the Constitution, that would require the consent of every state.
If the Democrats don't beat Mr. Trump, sooner or later they'll alight on the sensible course—take more-centrist positions and adopt conciliatory rhetoric. Bill Clinton did it in 1992: change your position on some issues and modify your rhetoric on others to win over the voters you need. That would enrage the mobs on campus and Twitter, and it's contrary to the approach taken by this year's leading contenders. But it had the distinct advantage of taking voters seriously—and winning.

Texto completo: Agree or disagree with Bernie Sanders, at least he's consistent—or so he claims. "Having a long record," the Vermont senator said in October, "gives people the understanding that these ideas that I'm talking about—they are in my guts. They are in my heart. This is who I am as a human being, and it ain't gonna change."
That's true up to a point. During half a century in public life, Mr. Sanders has dependably denounced "oligarchy" and proclaimed himself a "democratic socialist." But his definition of the term has radically changed. Last year he said his goal was "an economy in which you have wealth being created by the private sector, but you have a fair distribution of that wealth." He added: "I think that countries like Denmark and Sweden do very well."
He had a different vision in the 1970s, when he sought statewide office four times as the nominee of the Liberty Union Party of Vermont. Campaigning for U.S. Senate in 1971, he demanded the nationalization of utilities. In 1973 he proposed a federal takeover of "the entire energy industry," and in 1974 he wanted a 100% tax on all income above $1 million. In 1976 he asserted that workers needed to "take immediate control of the economy if we are to survive" and called for "public ownership of utilities, banks and major industries." He had a plan for "public control over capital." As late as 1987 he asserted that "democracy means public ownership of the major means of production."
By the time Mr. Sanders won his first election—as mayor of Burlington, Vt., in 1981—he had become an independent. He had also begun a dalliance with the Socialist Workers Party, a communist group that had followed Leon Trotsky. Mr. Sanders endorsed the SWP's presidential nominee in 1980 and 1984, spoke at SWP campaign rallies during that period, and in 1980 was part of its slate of would-be presidential electors.
The SWP promoted a foreign policy openly hostile to U.S. interests, and Mr. Sanders expressly endorsed some aspects of it. Last year the Washington Examiner quoted him from a 1980 press release: "I fully support the SWP's continued defense of the Cuban revolution." The party even backed Iran's new theocracy while it was holding U.S. Embassy personnel hostage. In a 1979 speech, presidential nominee Andrew Pulley said: "Who are these hostages anyway? Well, we can be sure that many of them are simply spies . . . or people assigned to protect the spies."
In 1985 Mayor Sanders visited Nicaragua. On returning, he called its Soviet-backed leader, Daniel Ortega, "impressive" and said it "makes sense" for the regime to suppress newspapers given the threat from the U.S.-supported Contra insurgency.
Mr. Sanders's 1997 memoir, "Outsider in the House," makes no mention of the SWP, and his governing style as mayor was not so radical. "Mr. Sanders did not campaign as a Socialist," the New York Times reported in 1981, quoting the mayor-elect: "I'm not going to war with the city's financial and business community." In "Why Bernie Sanders Matters" (2015), biographer Harry Jaffe writes that as a candidate "Sanders went out of his way to assure homeowners he would not raise their taxes." Perhaps because he knew Burlington's aldermen—and the voters—would balk at radical domestic measures, he projected his ideological ambitions abroad. If he did that as president, the consequences would be real.
He has tempered his enthusiasm for leftist Third World tyrants but remains cagey. Mr. Ortega left power in 1990 but returned in 2007. "He has since become a dictator, and I think that's unfortunate," Mr. Sanders said last month. Critics knew that in the '80s. Earlier he cast his previous support as simple antiwar activism: "I plead guilty to, throughout my adult life, doing everything that I can to prevent war and destruction." And in 2016 he said: "When I talk about democratic socialism, I'm not talking about Venezuela, I'm not talking about Cuba." That wasn't always the case.
After three decades in Congress, he has settled on a populist vision that fits in on the Democratic left. In a major speech last June elaborating his idea of socialism, he cast himself in the tradition of Franklin D. Roosevelt and urged listeners to "reclaim our democracy by having the courage to take on the powerful corporate interests whose greed is destroying the social and economic fabric of our country." He enumerated a series of positive rights—to "quality health care," "as much education as one needs," "a good job that pays a living wage," "affordable housing," "a secure retirement" and "a clean environment." But he said nothing about state control over the means of production or Fidel Castro's revolution.
"The world has come around to see things like he does," longtime Sanders staffer Phil Fiermonte told Mr. Jaffe in 2015. Maybe, but Mr. Sanders has come around further, to judge by his own words. Given what he used to stand for, inconsistency wouldn't be his greatest fault.

Texto completo: China's leaders sometimes seem 10 feet tall, presiding over a political and economic juggernaut that has founded universities at a rate of one a week and that recently used more cement in three years than the United States did in the entire 20th century.
President Donald Trump has hailed China's president, Xi Jinping, as a "brilliant leader," and Michael Bloomberg says Xi is "not a dictator." But we're now seeing the dangers of Xi's authoritarian model, for China and the world.
The first known coronavirus infection in the city of Wuhan presented symptoms beginning on Dec. 1, and by late December there was alarm in Wuhan's medical circles. That would have been the moment for the authorities to act decisively.
And act decisively they did - not against the virus, but against whistleblowers who were trying to call attention to the public health threat. A doctor who told a WeChat group about the virus was disciplined by the Communist Party and forced to admit wrongdoing. The police reported giving "education" and "criticism" to eight front-line doctors for "rumormongering" about the epidemic; instead of punishing these doctors, Xi should have listened to them.
China informed the World Health Organization of the virus on Dec. 31 but kept its own citizens in the dark; as other countries reported infections even as China pretended that it had confined the outbreak to Wuhan, Chinese joked grimly about a "patriotic" virus that only struck foreigners.
Wuhan's mayor said he wasn't authorized to discuss the virus until late this month. In that time, people traveled to and from Wuhan and didn't take precautions.
The government finally ordered a lockdown on Jan. 23 that effectively quarantined people in Wuhan. But by then, according to the mayor, five million people had already fled the city.
Partly because the government covered up the epidemic in the early stages, hospitals were not able to gather supplies, and there are now major shortages of testing kits, masks and protective gear. Some doctors were reduced to making goggles out of plastic folders.
One reason for the early cover-up is that Xi's China has systematically gutted institutions like journalism, social media, nongovernmental organizations, the legal profession and others that might provide accountability. These institutions were never very robust in China, but on and off they were tolerated until Xi came along.
I conducted a series of experiments on Chinese blogs over the years beginning in 2003 and was sometimes surprised by what I could get away with - but no longer. Xi has dragged China backward in terms of civil society, crushing almost every wisp of freedom and oversight.
For the same reason that Xi's increasingly authoritarian China bungled the coronavirus outbreak, it also mishandled a swine flu virus that since 2018 has devastated China's hog industry and killed almost one-quarter of the world's pigs.
Dictators often make poor decisions because they don't get accurate information: When you squelch independent voices you end up getting just flattery and optimism from those around you. Senior Chinese officials have told me that they are routinely lied to on trips to meet local officials and must dispatch their drivers and secretaries to assess the truth and gauge the real mood.
For this or other reasons, Xi has made a series of mistakes. He mishandled and inflamed the political crisis in Hong Kong, he inadvertently assured the reelection of his nemesis as president of Taiwan, and he has presided over worsening relations with the United States and many other countries.
The coronavirus has already reached the Xinjiang region in the Far West of China, and one risk is that it will spread in the internment camps where China is confining about one million Muslims with poor sanitation and limited health care.
Viruses are challenges for any country, and it's only fair to note that China does a better job protecting its people from measles than the U.S. does. It's a credit to China's system that a baby born in Beijing today has a longer life expectancy than a baby born in Washington, D.C. More broadly, the United States, which has several impoverished counties with lower life expectancy than Cambodia or Bangladesh, is in no position to lecture anyone about health.
But, with a dose of humility, let's get over any misplaced admiration some Americans have for Xi's authoritarian model.
The Chinese social contract has been that citizens will not get ballots but will live steadily better lives, yet China's economy is now as weak as it has been in three decades - and the coronavirus will sap growth further. Xi is not living up to his end of the bargain, and this is seen in the anger emerging on Chinese social media despite the best efforts of censors.
I don't know if Xi is in political trouble for his misrule, but he should be. He's a preening dictator, and with this outbreak some citizens are paying a price.

Texto completo: Black History Month, which began Feb. 1, is celebrated throughout Long Island in schools and at town halls, in lectures, films and art exhibitions - and in houses of worship. This week's clergy discuss how their congregations are marking 401 years of the African American experience.
The Rev. Jaye Brooks, Unitarian Universalist Congregation at Shelter Rock, Manhasset
The Unitarian Universalist Congregation at Shelter Rock in Manhasset honors Black History this month with a free four-session Freedom School that invites participants to explore the 400-year history of black lives in America.   Based on materials from The New York Times 1619 Project, the Freedom School will teach the 1619 origin of American slavery and its effects to this day. Topics include capitalism and slavery; consequences for the American health care system; structural racism on Long Island; and ownership of Native Americans during the slavery era. Journalist Nikole Hannah-Jones conceived and directed the 1619 Project, unveiled in August 2019. She saw the 400th anniversary of the arrival of the first enslaved Africans in America as an opportunity to consider what slavery has meant for our nation's development. Essays in the project take a modern phenomenon, like rush-hour traffic, and trace each to its roots in slavery.
At Shelter Rock, respect for every human's inherent worth and a commitment to lifelong learning prompted this exploration into the project's remarkable cache of history and analysis. As part of a faith tradition that encourages its members to work for justice as they continue to learn and grow, Shelter Rock intentionally offers learning opportunities that examine assumptions around race and power. It can be difficult for white Americans to make room for the discomfort that can arise in these conversations, but having them anyway is part of the congregation's vision to create a loving religious community, encourage spiritual growth, and build a more just and joyful world.
The Rev. William F. Brisotti
Pastor, Our Lady of the Miraculous Medal Roman Catholic Church, Wyandanch
How our parish honors Black History Month reflects who we are and what we do throughout the year. Black history is part of our history, as Catholics, as human beings and as citizens of the United States. Our parish has regularly scheduled Sunday Masses with African-American Gospel music and in Haitian Creole. We support and participate in the annual February diocesan Black Catholic Mass, held jointly with the ministries of the Diocese of Rockville Centre and of our mother Diocese of Brooklyn.
We honor the long tradition of black Catholics in our parish, diocese, nation and world, and our parish's legacy of credible advocacy and many decades of collaborative service within the minority community in Wyandanch, and in Suffolk County and beyond. Several not-for-profit agencies serving specific social needs affecting people of color were born because of our parish's efforts.
Our Gerald J. Ryan Outreach provides daily for the immediate needs of individuals and families and a summer camp for local children, and our multicultural parish Roundtable for the Common Good brings Catholic social teaching to bear on current issues inordinately affecting black and other minority communities.
St. Martin de Porres, a 17th-century Peruvian of African and Spanish parentage, is our adopted parish patron saint, attesting to the complexities of our black parishioners, with their deep roots in the southern United States, Harlem, Africa, Haiti, the Caribbean, Latin America and elsewhere.
The Rev. Henrietta Scott Fullard
Presiding elder (retired), Long Island District, African Methodist Episcopal Churches
Black History Month is a very significant period in which to gain insight into the lives and struggles of African Americans past and present. It's a time to recall the memories of past events and to take note of issues that still suppress the upward mobility of Black Americans.
Our congregations will have moments of celebration that include remembering the lives, service, contributions and sacrifices of Black Americans. Church members will share the individual stories of our history at showings of such films and videos as "Selma" and "12 Years a Slave." The screenings will be followed by brief discussions of what has changed and what still needs to change to make our lives better today.
Churches will have community outreaches to address homelessness, unemployment, incarceration, needs of the elderly, education and inequality. Members will be given the opportunity to use their skills and resources to minister to the least of God's people. Those who still have needs will be supported by the church and its ministries. The missionaries will provide support to black communities that still struggle with impoverishment. The adult ministry will provide a sacred space for black youth to come to when they need guidance. The church will continue to be the space where freedom in all areas must begin.

Trump's speech won't be first set during turmoil

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- Two decades ago, President Bill Clinton addressed a nation transfixed by impeachment. He didn't use the I-word once in a State of the Union address that ran on for 78 minutes.

Now, President Donald Trump prepares to address the nation under similar circumstances, with the added pressure of a looming presidential election thrown into the mix. And no one expects him to follow the Clinton model by ignoring the elephant in the room -- especially since he now appears likely to be acquitted the day after the speech.

Trump is hardly the first president to deliver a State of the Union address in a time of turmoil. Abraham Lincoln delivered a written report during the Civil War, Richard Nixon spoke while embroiled in the Watergate scandal. Gerald Ford declared "the state of the union is not good." But Clinton's 1999 speech offers the most obvious parallels.

A Republican-controlled House impeached Clinton in December 1998 on grounds that he had lied to a federal grand jury and obstructed justice about his relationship with White House intern Monica Lewinsky.

Just hours before Clinton

delivered his State of the Union address, White House lawyers opened their defense of the president in his Senate trial. They argued he was innocent of the charges and "must not be removed from office."

Clinton's address, in the same chamber where he had been impeached weeks earlier, was met with respectful applause, though some Republicans decided to boycott the address saying it was inappropriate for Clinton to appear before Congress during his impeachment trial. Two of his harshest Republican critics, House Majority Leader Dick Armey of Texas and House Majority Whip Tom DeLay of Texas, sat stonily side by side.

Clinton speechwriter Michael Waldman says he can't recall any discussion leading up to the 1999 address about whether Clinton should talk about the impeachment proceedings.

"It never was considered," says Waldman, president of the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU School of Law. "His entire goal in a speech like that was to remind people of the policy agenda that he cared about and that they liked, and also to remind people of the parts of the presidency that they liked."

Clinton focused his speech on using the large majority of a projected $4 trillion surplus over 15 years to shore up Social Security and Medicare. Republicans resisted and instead called for tax cuts. Indeed, he offered so many policy proposals that one Democratic lawmaker, Rep. Joseph Moakley of Massachusetts, remarked; "He did everything but buy a new dress for the Statue of Liberty."

Twenty-five years earlier, Nixon devoted much of his final State of the Union speech to the country's energy crisis. But near the end of his remarks, he added a "personal word" about Watergate. Nixon called for the investigation to end, declaring "one year of Watergate is enough" and said he had no "intention whatever" of resigning.

Nixon's poll standing bumped up past the two-thirds level after his State of the Union address. But there was more to Watergate, and as that scandal wore on, into impeachment proceedings, his job approval steadily sank, to 23 percent at the point he finally quit.

The New York Times recounted that Republicans in the chamber greeted Nixon with applause, cheers and whoops for more than two minutes. The "most startling demeanor" was on the Democratic side. Sen. Sam Ervin, chairman of the Watergate Committee, didn't applaud once. While snickers and grimaces greeted Nixon's pledge to protect Americans from such privacy invasions as "electronic snooping."

Trump is coming into the election year with his approval rating at 44% and his disapproval rating at 53%, according to the latest Gallup numbers. In seeking reelection, Trump is hoping to use a backlash against impeachment to help motivate his core supporters, but he also needs to reach out to a broader swath of voters.

The final vote in Trump's impeachment trial is now set for Wednesday afternoon. The Senate on Friday rejected the summoning of witnesses in the trial, all but ensuring Trump's eventual acquittal.

Republican strategist Matt Mackowiak said there will be lots of other opportunities for Trump to get the last word in on impeachment. The State of the Union is not that time.

"I think in many ways the single best opportunity he has with this particular State of the Union will be to attract a broader coalition of supporters," Mackowiak said. "I'm hoping that he doesn't go on offense too much."

Still, Trump can hardly get through any event at the White House without talking about the impeachment inquiry and trial. His comments in greeting the Louisiana State University college football champions and in signing a new trade deal with Canada and Mexico inevitably included references to the impeachment proceedings.

Aaron Kall, director of debate at the University of Michigan and an author about memorable State of the Union addresses, said that, based on history, Trump would be best served keeping the public's focus off impeachment during the State of the Union.

"The Clinton model proved to be successful," Kall said. But knowing Trump, he added, "It will be impossible for him not to take a victory lap."

Texto completo: Lisa Burgoa, an award-winning writer, New York Times crossword puzzle enthusiast, self-admitted Cat Stevens devotee, Polish poetry aficionado, and beloved daughter, sister, colleague, and friend died in Washington, DC on Monday, January 27, 2020. She was 22 years old.

Soft-spoken and deeply thoughtful, Lisa showed a keen interest in the world and the stories of people in it from a very early age. As the Utah-born daughter of a Polish mother and a Bolivian father who met each other while studying in Germany, Lisa was a first-generation American who grew up in Chile, Texas, Oklahoma and south Florida, where she began reading her father's subscription to The Economist at the age of 11.

It helped her develop unparalleled diplomatic skills: while relatives fiercely debated which of the family's many and varied food traditions were best, a grammar school-aged Lisa ended the discussion with a single word: spaghetti.

Drawn to journalism as a student at Cypress Bay High School in Weston, Florida, Lisa's creativity and insightful reporting were widely celebrated. Her editorial writing received the Florida Scholastic Press Association's "Best of the Best" award and won first place in the Sun Sentinel's High School Journalism Awards two years in a row.

As a senior, her storytelling attracted national attention, where she was one of a small handful of students in America to receive the Newseum Institute's prestigious Al Neuharth Free Spirit and Journalism Scholarship. Ever humble, she attributed her success to a keen listening ability developed through long hours working the drive-thru window of her hometown McDonald's.

Numerous schools competed for her attention, but Lisa decided to study at Georgetown University, where she further developed her reporting chops editing the opinion and feature sections of her college paper, the Hoya, sleuthing around for stories on the Georgetown neighborhood beat. While notably one of the quietest students in every class, her thoughtful, sensitive way with words was always shared out loud by her professors, who held it up as the standard other students should aspire to, embarrassing her every single time.

Along the way, she discovered a newfound love for true crime stories, Jewish folklore, Peruvian food, and pop songs of the 1980s and '90s, while eagerly leading her family on "experimental restaurant tours" across Georgetown every time they visited campus - which occasionally made her thankful for the medical training of her younger sister, Sara.

It was at Georgetown that her commitment to social justice evolved into a deep passion for labor issues - "a real love," as one classmate recalled, "for real people doing the real work, day after day, without getting any credit for it." She interned at the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press and the Bridge Initiative, a research project dedicated to countering Islamophobia in America.

She also volunteered at the DC Schools Project through Georgetown's Center for Social Justice Research, Teaching and Service. There, she designed lesson plans and taught English classes for DC's adult Spanish-speaking immigrant population while serving as the organization's documentarian, interviewing subjects about their experiences navigating the American immigration system.

In May of 2019, she earned a degree in International Policy Economy from Georgetown's Walsh School of Foreign Service, with studies focused on global development, labor and inequality. By then, she had developed what one friend called "a solace in invisibility, of being able to touch people's lives through her words without having to be the one to speak them."

She took a job at West Wing Writers, a speechwriting and strategy firm in Washington, DC where she had interned during the summer of 2018. She quickly became a beloved co-worker and friend, actively participating in the staff's daily crossword puzzle addiction, anchoring weekly dinner gatherings of associates, and cracking up co-workers with her quiet but wicked sense of humor.

All the while, her bond to her family remained strong. When her sister received an Apple Watch for Christmas, Lisa came up with a novel approach to meet its ambitious exercise and activity goals: instead of walking or going to the gym, Lisa suggested the two of them partake in a marathon session of the popular dance video game, Just Dance. In the end, the two of them far exceeded the steps necessary to meet the exercise goals for three full days.

While "she is invisible to us now," as a college friend puts it, "the impact through her words remains. She speaks to me in the songs that make me cry, in the beauty of spoken Polish or Spanish, in the poetry she's written - and I hope we all hear her speaking, too, softly and ceaselessly. The same way your heart is always right there in your chest, but you only feel when it hurts."

Lisa Burgoa was the loving daughter of Monika Rowinska-Burgoa and Marco Burgoa of Weston, Florida; the beloved sister of Sara Lena Burgoa of Washington, DC; the cherished granddaughter of Stanislaw and Eleanora Rowinska of Warsaw, Poland, and Marco Antonio Burgoa and Rosario Salinas of La Paz, Bolivia; and the precious niece of Agnieszka and Christoph Schwarzweller of Gda sk, Poland.

8,024 Attacks hit Afghanistan toward end of '19, report says

Texto completo: Correction: *A headline on an Afghanistan story published Sunday in Nation & World should have said the Taliban and other groups carried out 8,204 attacks in the final quarter of 2019.
Correction: The Baltimore Sun regrets the errors.
WASHINGTON - The Taliban and other groups carried out a record number of attacks in Afghanistan during the last several months of 2019, according to an inspector general report. The increase in violence occurred during a period in which President Donald Trump tweeted that the United States was "hitting our Enemy harder than at any time in the last ten years!"
The number of attacks, detailed in the quarterly report from the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, a government watchdog formed in 2008, highlights the disparity between talking points on suppressing the Taliban and the reality on the ground: Despite a concerted bombing campaign and U.S. and Afghan offensive-ground operations, Taliban fighters are still able to attack at levels similar to those a decade ago.
"Both overall enemy-initiated attacks and effective enemy-initiated attacks during the fourth quarter of 2019 exceeded same-period levels in every year since recording began in 2010," said the report, which was released Friday.
The Taliban and other armed groups carried out 8,204 attacks in the final quarter of the year, 37% of which inflicted casualties, according to the report.
The tally is one of the few remaining public barometers for the United States' war effort in Afghanistan after the U.S. military command there stopped releasing or classified others, such as the number of Afghan casualties and the percentage of districts controlled by the Afghan government versus Taliban forces.
"There's so little you can publicly talk about that garners importance," John F. Sopko, the special inspector general for Afghanistan reconstruction, said Thursday.
This type of information has been used in the past to extrapolate a trend toward victory or defeat over the course of the war, but ultimately it has foretold little in the United States' longest conflict.
The expansion of the U.S. air campaign seemed to mirror the increase in Taliban attacks.
In 2019, U.S. military aircraft dropped 7,423 bombs and missiles - a record number since the Air Force began recording the data in 2006, according to recently released Air Force documents.
At the beginning of the year, U.S. Special Operations missions had increased by 124% from 2018, according to military documents, a rate that most likely continued throughout 2019.
In 2019, the U.S. military command in the country, led by Gen. Austin Miller, focused on inflicting heavy casualties on the Taliban in an effort to keep its leadership involved in peace negotiations taking place in Doha, Qatar.
The offensives also aimed to push back the insurgent group to both lower Afghan casualties and hold what territory remained under government control.
But the increase in military operations from the United States, the Afghan government and the Taliban are not without cost. There were more than 8,000 civilian casualties in Afghanistan in 2019, according to U.N. data.
Twenty U.S. troops died during combat operations in 2019, the most in any year since 2014.

Trump adds 6 countries, 4 in Africa, to travel ban

Texto completo: The Trump administration on Friday added six countries to the nations facing stringent travel restrictions, virtually blocking immigration from Africa's most populous nation, Nigeria, and from Myanmar, where refugees are fleeing genocide.
Beside Nigeria, varying degrees of restrictions will hit three other African countries, Eritrea, Sudan and Tanzania, and one former Soviet state, Kyrgyzstan. Myanmar's Muslim Rohingya could also be caught in the crossfire. The total number of countries on the restricted travel list now stands at 13.
Immigrant visas, issued mostly to foreigners intending to live in the United States, will be banned from Nigeria, Myanmar, Eritrea and Kyrgyzstan. The ban would prevent immigrants from Sudan and Tanzania from obtaining diversity visas. Homeland Security and State Department officials said some immigrants would be able to obtain waivers from the restrictions.
The proclamation, which President Donald Trump was expected to sign Friday, will take effect Feb. 22.
The administration has argued that the ban, enacted in 2017 to restrict travel from Muslim-majority countries, is necessary to ensure that countries satisfy security requirements for travel into the United States, or face restrictions until they do.
The expansion of the restrictions, which already affected more than 135 million people in seven countries, is likely to hinder more than 12,300 potential immigrants from resettling in the United States or reuniting with their families. The effect on Nigeria, not only Africa's most populous country but also its largest economy, could be particularly severe.
A U.S. government official said the administration was adding Nigeria and Tanzania to the list because of the number of people who come from the African countries on a visa and end up illegally staying in the United States. The official said Sudan and Eritrea had not satisfied the administration's information-sharing requirements.
The extension of the travel ban comes at a delicate time for international travel. American Airlines and Delta Air Lines began on Friday to voluntarily curtail flights to the United States from China to combat the coronavirus, and further restrictions are likely.
But it also comes as the 2020 election heats up. Trump is expected to use his travel ban, as well as his efforts to cut refugee admissions, to rally his political base as his administration contends with a Senate impeachment trial.
Immigrants, citizens and students have already experienced the effect of Trump's increased vetting at ports throughout the border.
The administration has contended that the countries on the list have harbored terrorists, maintained outdated passport systems or failed to ensure adequate information sharing. Trump has also made disparaging comments about African nations in the past, complaining that Nigerians who entered the United States on visas would never "go back to their huts."
Democrats, who have long opposed the ban, condemned its expansion.
"President Trump and his administration's continued disdain for our nation's national security and our founding ideals of liberty and justice dishonor our proud immigrant heritage and the diversity that strengthens and enriches our communities," Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California said in a statement.
Doug Rand, who helped found Boundless Immigration, a technology company that helps immigrants obtain green cards, said the additions to the ban would not just affect foreigners but also American citizens.
"It has become a de facto family separation policy besides the obvious one at the border," Rand said. "This will just magnify the pain to extend it to other countries."

Texto completo: There is no Spanish translation for a caucus, that political process particular to just a few states. It is simply "el caucus."
But for many Latinos in Iowa, el caucus is hardly simple. The state's Latino population has surged in recent decades, with the number registered to vote estimated at more than 50,000, making it a potentially important bloc in the fast-approaching Democratic caucuses. And local leaders like Vanessa Marcano-Kelly believe there are not nearly enough Spanish-tailored caucus sites or interpreters to meet the need in the state.
"I feel like this year everyone has been talking about how Iowa is superwhite, but it's really not superwhite to me," said Marcano-Kelly, who petitioned the state Democratic Party to create caucus sites in Spanish. "I see Latinos everywhere."
It is the first Iowa caucus for Marcano-Kelly, 34. In 2016, she watched from the sidelines, slightly bewildered at the spectacle and wondering how people could possibly understand if they did not speak English. As she wrote in her application months ago to the state Democratic Party, the Spanish sites would "ensure that the voices of all people can really be heard."
So on Feb. 3, the doors will open at the South Suburban YMCA in Des Moines for hundreds of Spanish-speaking caucusgoers.
Marcano-Kelly has been refreshing her Spanish vocabulary as she searches for the right words -- some easier (viable is "viable"), some more obscure (threshold is "límite").
Although Latinos make up just 6% of Iowa's population, they have more than doubled in the state in the last two decades.
In nearly a dozen towns throughout the state, Latinos now make up more than one-third of the population. And since 2016, the League of United Latin American Citizens has worked to get thousands more registered to vote, a number the group estimates has now grown to 53,000.
Roughly 194,000 Latinos live in the state, and by most estimates, fewer than 3,000 participated in the 2016 caucuses. This year, Latino activists expect that number to grow to 20,000 or more. And for the first time, there are set to be six Spanish satellite caucus sites, a concession Democratic Party officials made to try to increase participation.
But despite the efforts, many activists believe there are not nearly enough interpreters lined up for the caucuses. Party officials are still scrambling to find bilingual speakers to run the Spanish caucuses, even as they look for more Spanish speakers to volunteer at other sites throughout the state.
And while some campaigns plan to send Spanish-speaking volunteers to towns where Latinos make up more than one-third of the population, there is no clear system to ensure that Spanish-speaking caucusgoers will have interpretation services.
"Whatever the number is, I think it would be impossible to have enough to meet the need," said Rob Barron, a Polk County school board member who runs a group dedicated to electing more Latinos to office. "Even if you're a native English speaker, the process is intimidating. So for those who are willing to walk into that room without speaking the language, then hear words like viable, it's only going to get more and more chaotic and confusing."
When the Democratic Party put a call out for applications for satellite caucuses that could be held away from traditional geographic precincts, Marcano-Kelly knew that she would write one for Spanish. She thought of several of her friends who recently became citizens but do not speak English as well as many Puerto Ricans she knows who moved to Iowa after Hurricane Maria struck the island in 2017.
After submitting the satellite application, Marcano-Kelly decided she would become the precinct captain for Sen. Bernie Sanders' campaign, in charge of rounding up supporters who come to the Spanish caucus. But in recent days she has found herself grappling with whether her primary responsibility lies with the campaign or individual voters.
Evidence of a booming Latino population can be seen in pockets all over the state, including Des Moines, where Latinos make up 12% of the city's population and 26% of public school students. In recent years, Mexicans, Guatemalans and Salvadorans have settled here, many moving from California, Illinois and Texas.
Showing up to places where Latinos congregate has been a part of the strategy for some of the campaigns and the League of United Latin American Citizens, more commonly known as LULAC, which has led the effort to register more Latinos. The group has held voter registration drives at stores and sponsored several mock caucus trainings in the state.

Texto completo: We are living in the age of the Modern Farmhouse. This is why so many of our kitchens have apron sinks, Shaker cabinets and industrial lighting, whether the home is a prewar apartment in Manhattan or a split-level in Mamaroneck. A dining room wouldn't be complete without a table made of reclaimed wood, perhaps from a barn. Not our barn, of course, because who living in a city has a barn?
The design style, a modern twist on the classic American farmhouse, takes the clean lines of contemporary design and accents them with industrial finishes, all while giving a nod to what is considered homey or rustic. A variation on the shabby chic phenomenon of the 1990s, the look was prominently featured by Chip and Joanna Gaines on the HGTV show, "Fixer Upper." The couple who rebranded Waco, Texas, as a design destination have temporarily left the airwaves while they prepare to launch their own cable network, but their signature brand of shiplap walls and cozy white sofas doesn't appear to be going anywhere.
Home decor stores sell decorative accessories that look like someone's fantasy of what farmers might actually hang on their walls: picture frames fashioned out of faux old wood windows; wood word art -- so much word art -- that makes stark proclamations in chunky text like "Be a Voice, Not an Echo" or, more to the point for a kitchen wall, "Eat"; and distressed coffee tables that look like they've been planted around the family hearth for decades, not just shipped from China.
Instagram accounts such as Our Faux Farmhouse, The Modest Farmhouse and Our Vintage Farmhouse have amassed hundreds of thousands of followers with endless photographs of white living rooms, barn doors hung from black hinges and wicker baskets full of fuzzy throw blankets. The Instagram hashtag Modern Farmhouse has almost 1.2 million posts. Scroll through it and you start to wonder if color exists beyond white, black and reclaimed wood.
"The modern barn or farmhouse is here to stay," said Sasha Bikoff, a New York City interior designer who is building herself a 4,000-square-foot, all-white modern barnhouse in East Hampton.
But I set out wondering if perhaps we'd reached Peak Farmhouse. There have been flickering signs that the relentless pursuit of faux farm may be waning. A year ago, Southern Living magazine called for the end of cookie-cutter farmhouse decor and word art. And recently, House Beautiful asked, "Is the Modern Farmhouse Trend Dead?"
If Pinterest is a window into the psyche of the American aesthetic, the view remains relentlessly agrarian, or at least faux agrarian. In November, searches on the site for "bohemian farmhouse decor" were up 335% from a year earlier, and up 302% for "farmhouse front porches."
The rise of modern farmhouse -- Laura Fenton, writing for Curbed, reported that the term joined the American lexicon in 2016 -- coincides with a time of American instability and uncertainty. If the future is unclear, it's no wonder we might want to re-create an American pastoral where we can wrap ourselves in a flannel throw blanket and sit in a wicker chair on a front porch gazing into the distance like pioneers.
This version of the homestead is punctuated with edgy details such as Edison bulbs, brass faucets and stark black trim.
Modern farmhouse gives us license to do the work ourselves, to be homesteaders-lite. Those of us looking for a crafty outlet can express ourselves by refurbishing an old dresser, repurposing discarded window frames or wrapping Mason jars with burlap. Who needs an expensive interior designer when the aisles of home decor stores are packed with whisky-barrel tables and vintage kitchen canisters just begging to be purchased?
The Gaineses "are cool, they're attractive. They're raising goats and they're gardening, their kids all seem well-adjusted," said Gideon Mendelson, an interior designer in New York. "The look that they've marketed, it's good-looking, it's easy on the eye, it's not risky, it feels homey, it touches on a lot of things that we want."
"Fixer Upper" may be over, but the Gaineses aren't. Their brand, Magnolia, is now a magazine, a market and a real estate agency. In October, Magnolia will launch a cable network, replacing the DIY Network.
But no single look can last forever, even if its biggest champions are ascending and selling a line of housewares at Target. There must be a breaking point, right? "Eventually, everybody always tires of it, that is why a trend is fleeting," said Michael Amato, the creative director of the Urban Electric Co., a lighting designer.
Designers are noticing subtle shifts. Edison bulbs are losing favor, as homeowners realize that while a raw bulb may look pretty, staring directly at one is not terribly appealing. And color seems to be making a comeback -- green kitchens!
"The modern farmhouse is evolving into something a little bit more global," Bikoff said. "It could be Balinese, it could be Chinese. It could be a little bit Italian from the '70s."
So, if we tire of American farmhouses, we could always branch out and dabble with ones that look like they're in the south of France, or maybe the English countryside or Indonesia. Who knows? This fantasy farm life could be limitless.

Texto completo: You may have heard about the controversy surrounding "American Dirt," the newly released novel by Jeanine Cummins, and the most recent pick for Oprah's Book Club. Flatiron Books recently canceled the rest of Cummins' book tour, citing concerns for the author's safety.
Much of the public discussion of the controversy, including a recent New York Times story, seems to be treating this as an example of so-called "outrage culture," over the fact that Cummins is not of Mexican descent and has not personally had the experience of migrant peoples.But this controversy is not that.
Upon announcing her choice of the book, Oprah Winfrey declared, "I feel that everyone who reads this book is going to be immersed in the experience of what it means to be a migrant on the run for freedom."
Winfrey's enthusiasm stands in stark contrast to the judgment of New York Times book critic Parul Sehgal, who wrote, "What thin creations these characters are -- and how distorted they are by the stilted prose and characterizations."
In fact, both pre- and post-publication objections to the book were not over Cummins' identity, but over the fact that she gets many things wrong about the culture and experiences she is attempting to portray.
Myriam Gurba, a writer of Mexican heritage, in an essay recounting how her negative review of "American Dirt" was declined by a "feminist magazine," even though Gurba had been solicited to write it, said, "(American) Dirt" is a Frankenstein of a book, a clumsy and distorted spectacle and while some white critics have compared Cummins to Steinbeck, I think a more apt comparison is to Vanilla Ice."
Writing at the Huffington Post, David J. Schmidt catalogs portions of the novel which feel "cribbed" from Latino writers, such as the Chicago-area's own Luis Alberto Urrea. It is wonderful to seek outside sources to inform one's writing. If the sources are not transformed through the writing process into something new and truthful, though, it's a problem.
Other writers have pointed out passages of erroneous Spanish, and Sehgal summed up the reading experience by declaring, "the book feels conspicuously like the work of an outsider."
Cummins is not being criticized because she is a non-Mexican person writing about the Mexican experience. She is being criticized because she is a non-Mexican person writing about the Mexican experience poorly.
All artists should feel free to explore anything that draws their interest, but good intentions don't cover faulty execution. As Rebecca Makkai said of her decision to write about the 1980s AIDS crisis in Chicago in "The Great Believers," despite having no personal experience with those involved in the era, "I don't need to apologize for writing across difference; I need to apologize if I get it wrong."
This is criticism, not "canceling." "American Dirt" got a lot of hype, a seven-figure advance and rapturous endorsements from literary lights such as Stephen King, Sandra Cisneros, Ann Patchett and Kristin Hannah. Don Winslow, author of "The Border," called it "A 'Grapes of Wrath' for our times." Cummins is selling thousands and thousands of books, being interviewed on national television and has a film version in the works with Clint Eastwood's production company.
If that's cancellation, sign me up.
The incident is an illuminating look at what happens to a book when the publishing machinery turns a book into a "product" -- and loses sight of the quality of the book itself.
Oprah says she has been listening to the controversy and hopes to address it in the forthcoming episode of her book club featuring "American Dirt."
I hope it's a conversation worth having. Let's step away from culture-war tropes.

Book recommendations from the Biblioracle
John Warner tells readers what book to pick up next, based on the last five titles they've read.

1. "A Gentleman in Moscow" by Amor Towles
2. "Becoming" by Michelle Obama
3. "Letters From Skye" by Jessica Brockmole
4. "Faith" by Jimmy Carter
5. "A Damsel in Distress" by P.G. Wodehouse
-- Michael H., Aurora
My expert sleuthing has uncovered the fact that "Letters From Skye" is an epistolary novel, which means Michael will have no objections to the form, which means I can recommend a classic, "Dangerous Liaisons" by Pierre Choderlos de Laclos.

1. "Everything I Never Told You" by Celeste Ng
2. "Never Have I Ever" by Joshilyn Jackson
3. "Normal People" by Sally Rooney
4. "The Death of Mrs. Westaway" by Ruth Ware
5. "The Stranger in the Woods: The Extraordinary Story of the Last True Hermit" by Michael Finkel
-- Maureen W., Glenview
I think Maureen will devour Marcy Dermansky's "Very Nice" in a day, just like I did.

1. "The Grammarians" by Cathleen Schine
2. "Drive Your Plow Over the Bones of the Dead" by Olga Tokarczuk
3. "The Wolf Border" by Sarah Hall
4. "A Primer for Forgetting: Getting Past the Past" by Lewis Hyde
5. "Visitation Street" by Ivy Pochoda
-- Cecelia B., Chicago
Some of the commentary Cecelia included with her list of recent reads indicates she's not just a reader, but an enthusiastic reader, with passionate responses (both positive and not) to everything she reads. Recommending a book to this kind of reader is both exciting and anxiety-producing. But that's why I'm the Biblioracle. "Disappearing Earth" by Julia Phillips.

Texto completo: No one knew how "Before Sunrise" would end. In addition to leaving the audience on a cliffhanger -- would the visiting American Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and the French student Celine (Julie Delpy) meet again after one night of passionate conversation on the streets of Vienna? -- the filmmakers themselves were at a loss until the last minute.
"We shot in chronological order and worked on the script every weekend throughout the shoot," director and co-writer Richard Linklater said. "We went pretty far into this thinking they weren't going to plan to meet again, and the night before, we were up until 3 in the morning rewriting the final scene."
Made for just $2.5 million, "Before Sunrise" opened the 1995 Sundance Film Festival and formed a collaborative partnership among Linklater, Hawke and Delpy that led to two sequels, "Before Sunset" (2004) and "Before Midnight" (2013), and decades of friendship.
In honor of the first film's 25th anniversary, the stars and director talked about making the unconventional romance. Here are excerpts from those conversations.
The idea for the movie came to Linklater during a night spent with a woman he met in a Philadelphia toy store in 1989. Years later, he would learn she had died in a motorcycle accident just before "Before Sunrise" began filming.
Richard Linklater: This girl was flirting with me while I waited for my sister (to finish shopping), so I wrote a little note like, "Hey, I'm in town for one night if you want to hang out." Somewhere in the night I said to her, "I want to make a film about this. Just this feeling." That's really all it was trying to ever capture -- that rush of meeting someone and that undercurrent of flirtation and romance.
It took a bicoastal casting call and more than six months to find the perfect leads.
Linklater: It wasn't clear if it was going to be a European male and American female (or vice versa). In the first draft, we named the characters Chris and Terry because both are kind of genderless. It was that open.
Anthony Rapp invited me to see a play he was in with Ethan Hawke in New York. I had never met Ethan, but at that moment, he was the biggest star in his age range. I ended up at a bar with him after the play.
Ethan Hawke: We hung out until 4 a.m. After that, Rick sent me the script, and I thought he was offering me the part. I was really excited and had all these questions, and I realized after talking to my agents that he was not offering -- he was asking me to audition with about 10,000 other people.
Linklater: Julie was the second actor I met on the first day of our big LA casting session. I remember liking her, and her resume was impressive. She'd worked all over Europe. She was just getting started in the U.S., but she immediately went to the top of the list.
Julie Delpy: I like the idea of people meeting over one night and falling in love. (Linklater) clearly stated that he wanted the actors involved in the writing, and I liked that. It wasn't just a part.
Hawke: Meeting Julie was like meeting a character from a novel, like Anna Karenina or something. She's a very deep person. I'd never felt so American and so dumb.
Delpy: He was like a puppy, so young and sweet. He hates that, but really he had a beautiful naive quality about him. I mean naive in a good way, naive but very smart at the same time.
Delpy, Hawke and Linklater headed to Vienna for a three-week intensive workshop ahead of the summer 1994 shoot and continued revising the script throughout 25 days of filming.
Hawke: Revising is way too mild of a word. Rick wanted to make a movie about living in the moment. And to do that we were all going to have to live in the moment together to create the movie. For every scene in there, we wrote, like, 17 that didn't make the cut.
Delpy: It was intense, and a lot of my personal feelings went into it. I was an extremely romantic person, very pure and full of dreams. The writing was very organic. The guys would listen to me as I was really the only woman in the room, especially when we got to Vienna.
Linklater: To this day, they don't really get the credit as actors because everybody thinks they're improvising.
Regular trains were used to film Jesse and Celine's meet-cute, as well as Celine's sendoff in the closing scene.
Linklater: It was hell. We rode the trains from Vienna to Salzburg and back for three days to get the beginning scene and the shots out the windows. You're good when the train reaches a certain speed, but if it's jumping around, you're screwed.
Hawke: My stepfather had given me this burgundy turtleneck, and I was in love with it. I don't know why. And then I just immediately regretted it because it was really hot. What idiot thinks they look good in a turtleneck in summer in Vienna?
Linklater: The very last shot of the movie, when Julie walks onto the train, we had that timed to the second and we got one chance to do it. It was like, the train's going to leave here at 8:37:30. I'm going to say action at 8:20. She's going to get on a non-moving train. And then when she gets to her seat, the train is going to be moving. It was tense, but we rehearsed the hell out of it and it worked.
Delpy: It was insanely hot. I had not slept in days because we shot (mostly) at night. I remember being miserable. It was the end of the shoot, and I felt I was never going to see Rick and Ethan again.
When the pair almost kiss while listening to Kath Bloom's "Come Here" in the record store booth, Delpy and Hawke's reactions were authentic.
Linklater: That's the only time I withheld anything from the cast. The lyrics were in the script, but they had never actually heard the song. So you can see them really listening because they'd never heard that yearning, creaky thing in Kath Bloom's voice that's so moving.
Hawke: It's probably my single favorite take of anything I've been involved with.
Delpy: That was really special. It was like magic -- each time I felt Ethan looking away, I would look at him and vice versa. I almost fell in love with him right there, but then Rick said cut.
Jesse and Celine's first kiss takes place on Vienna's Prater Ferris wheel at sunset, but was difficult in more ways than one.
Linklater: We tried to shoot it at sunset, but they would only stop the Ferris wheel for 10 minutes, and then we'd have to go around and do it again. We had three different light levels by the time we finished. So we went back a week later and reshot that in the morning when they let us stop it for an hour. When you see their first kiss, that was shot in the a.m.
Hawke: Julie is afraid of heights. Try making out with somebody who's absolutely petrified. It was challenging, and I don't think she was terribly impressed -- she'd been with a lot more interesting men than me.
Linklater intentionally left several elements of the film up to the audience's imagination, namely did Jesse and Celine have sex?
Linklater: Technically, you could see it any way you want. If you look closely, she's dressed a little differently. So if you really do the math, you go OK, that dress had to come off to get that shirt off. Something happened. I think all the hints are there.
Every nine years, there's been a sequel, but it's unlikely a fourth film would arrive on schedule.
Hawke: There was a feeling I had in my gut when we finished "Before Midnight" that I'd never had before, which was that we were done. "Sunrise," "Sunset," "Midnight" is one work in its own strange way. That doesn't mean there won't be another work, like an epilogue. I would be curious about an "After" series, about something where you really deal with the second half of your life.
Linklater: Maybe we'll wait until they're in their 80s. I'm not ruling that out.

Texto completo: CORRECTION: This story contains corrected material, published Feb. 6, 2020.
(The headline as published has been corrected in this text.)
The Taliban and other groups carried out a record number of attacks in Afghanistan during the last several months of 2019, according to an inspector general report. The increase in violence occurred during a period in which President Donald Trump tweeted that the United States was "hitting our Enemy harder than at any time in the last ten years!"
The number of attacks, detailed in the quarterly report from the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, a government watchdog formed in 2008, highlights the disparity between talking points on suppressing the Taliban and the reality on the ground: Despite a concerted bombing campaign and U.S. and Afghan offensive-ground operations, Taliban fighters are still able to attack at levels similar to those a decade ago.
"Both overall enemy-initiated attacks and effective enemy-initiated attacks during the fourth quarter of 2019 exceeded same-period levels in every year since recording began in 2010," said the report, which was released Friday.
The Taliban and other armed groups carried out 8,204 attacks in the final quarter of the year, 37% of which inflicted casualties, according to the report.
The tally is one of the few remaining public barometers for the United States' war effort in Afghanistan after the U.S. military command there stopped releasing or classified others, such as the number of Afghan casualties and the percentage of districts controlled by the Afghan government versus Taliban forces.
"There's so little you can publicly talk about that garners importance," John F. Sopko, the special inspector general for Afghanistan reconstruction, said Thursday.
This type of information has been used in the past to extrapolate a trend toward victory or defeat over the course of the war, but ultimately it has foretold little in the United States' longest conflict.
The expansion of the U.S. air campaign seemed to mirror the increase in Taliban attacks.
In 2019, U.S. military aircraft dropped 7,423 bombs and missiles -- a record number since the Air Force began recording the data in 2006, according to recently released Air Force documents.
At the beginning of the year, U.S. Special Operations missions had increased by 124% from 2018, according to military documents, a rate that most likely continued throughout 2019.
In 2019, the U.S. military command in the country, led by Gen. Austin Miller, focused on inflicting heavy casualties on the Taliban in an effort to keep its leadership involved in peace negotiations taking place in Doha, Qatar.
The offensives also aimed to push back the insurgent group to both lower Afghan casualties and hold what territory remained under government control.
But the increase in military operations from the United States, the Afghan government and the Taliban are not without cost. There were more than 8,000 civilian casualties in Afghanistan in 2019, according to U.N. data.
Twenty U.S. troops died during combat operations in 2019, the most in any year since 2014.

Texto completo: Last May, Sen. Elizabeth Warren tweeted a photograph of a dog surrounded by the chewed-up detritus of what appeared to be some unfortunate household item. It was Bailey, her family's adolescent golden retriever.
"Bailey was a bad boy this morning," she wrote. "But at least he's sorry."
Bailey often appears in his owner's social media accounts.
So do Truman and Buddy, the mixed-breed dogs who belong to Pete Buttigieg and his husband, Chasten -- although as befitting media-savvy members of a millennial-run household, they also have their own, dog-centric Twitter feed.
Non-punctuated and mostly nonsensical, Truman and Buddy's posts feature approximations of the sort of things Midwestern dogs might say, if they actually said anything. Topics include Christmas ("ther is a tree in the living room again"; irony ("GLAM," next to a goofy selfie); and stoner-type observations about food and identity ("I AM A LOAF OF OFN BREAD").
W.C. Fields famously advised actors never to work with animals, lest they be upstaged or unpleasantly surprised by unscripted moments.
Michael Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York, seemed to illustrate the wisdom of this advice last week on the campaign trail in Vermont.
Introduced to a dog, he grabbed its nose and shook hello -- not a traditional greeting, but a maneuver that seemed quintessentially Bloomberg-esque, as if he had studied the manual for how to be a normal person but hadn't gotten the details right.
But for most politicians, dogs are no-downside campaign enhancers: friendly foils, emollient front-animals, reliable comic relief providers, and slobbery good will ambassadors. They can make even the chilliest candidate seem warmer.
According to the most recent survey of pet owners by the American Pet Products Association, a trade group, some 63.4 million American households have dogs, a state of affairs that creates a natural constituency of citizens who might be disposed toward dog-owning candidates. And dogs make great surrogates, in part because they never say anything, let alone the wrong thing.
Dogs also make excellent presidential props, of course.
President Richard Nixon weathered a financial-improprieties scandal during his vice presidential run in 1952 before becoming president by, in part, speaking eloquently (for him) about Checkers, the dog his family had accepted as a gift. President Herbert Hoover, burdened with a stuffy, stilted image, successfully humanized himself by releasing a photograph in which he communed in a manly yet affectionate manner with his German shepherd, King Tut.
And fans of President Barack Obama loved it when his family brought Bo and then Sunny, Portuguese water dogs, into the White House, even after Sunny knocked down a 2-year-old visitor.
(The exception to all this, as is so often the case, is President Donald Trump, who regularly compares his enemies to dogs in terms unflattering to the dogs, and is the only president in 100 years not to have installed a First Dog in the White House. But the normal rules of politics generally don't apply to him. He doesn't even have a cat.)
Many of the Democratic candidates for president have dogs, including former Vice President Joe Biden, who has two: Champ and Major, both German shepherds. The two make occasional social media appearances, most notably this past Christmas, when Biden tweeted out holiday greetings that showed the dogs in a "Home Alone"-style video rooting under the tree, munching on Christmas cookies and cavorting with what looked like a squeaky stuffed Santa toy.
Meanwhile, Warren's and Buttigieg's dogs are highly visible features of their campaigns, in notably different ways.
Bailey has been a rambunctious part of Warren's bid for the Democratic nomination since he came into her family's life, a gift of her husband, Bruce, in 2018. He travels in the car with the couple when they drive to New Hampshire for campaign events and had been a stand in for the senator in Iowa -- when she was stuck in Washington at the president's impeachment trial.
"He's still a puppy, but he has that incredible love-the-people mentality," the candidate's son and sometime dogsitter, Alex Warren, said last month at the campaign's field office in Cambridge.
Alex Warren, 43, had brought Bailey to a meet-the-dog event for volunteers.
Introduced as "our future first dog," Bailey proved a charismatic if unpredictable surrogate, whacking things with his tail, rolling around with his paws in the air, munching on hoodies and slobbering on the volunteers.
"The selfie line with Bailey is a really acrobatic experience," Alex Warren said.
Alex Warren, an IT consultant, took a disciplined approach to the interview, confining his answers to the subject of Bailey.
But he did reveal that he and his wife have their own dog, Oberon, aka Obi Warren Kenobi, and that Obi and Bailey spent last Halloween together. Obi dressed as Batdog, and Bailey was festooned with two large pennies to depict Warren's belief that wealth over $50 million should be subject to a 2% annual surcharge.
"That's the scariest costume the wealthy will ever see," a user named Zach tweeted in response.
Bailey is a popular figure in the wider canine community in Fresh Pond park in Cambridge. "A lot of us recognize Bailey before we see the senator," said Jennifer Kay Goodman, 53, who showed up at the campaign event with Pele, her Boston terrier, and some homemade dog biscuits.
Dog ownership is a good quality in a candidate, she said. "If you can take care of a dog, and dogs like you, it says a lot about your character."
But while Bailey is a flesh-and-blood participant in campaign events, the Buttigieg pets, Truman and Buddy, are mainly virtual ones, at least so far. They regularly appear in the social media feeds of the candidate and his husband. But their Twitter account (@firstdogsSB), is popular, with 90,500 followers.
Fans follow the ups and downs of the dogs' lives, learning of their hopes and passions, including those that have to do with peanut butter. In October, the subject was Buddy's Halloween costume, a shiny green-and-yellow outfit, the meaning of which was unclear at first.
"OMG GOT MY HALOSWEEN COSTUM," the dog (or someone in the voice of the dog) wrote. "DO YOU WANT TO SEEZ IT OMG I AM so EXCITE."
But what was it, exactly? The caption on the photo said it: "ACVOCADO."
The Buttigieg dogs have taken a bold approach to the classic Twitter conundrum: Do you say some normal thing while abiding by conventional rules of spelling, grammar and punctuation, or are we pioneering a whole new freestyling vernacular in which there seems to be no filter between our random fleeting thoughts and our thrilled belief that other people want to hear them?
Don't ask the Buttigieg campaign. "Buddy and Truman have full creative control over their Twitter account," Tess Whittlesey, deputy national press secretary, said via email.
As for the dogs' part in the campaign: "The dogs primarily serve in the important role of South Bend representatives for the campaign while Pete and Chasten are on the road," she said. "They have quite the following in South Bend as well, and always enjoy running into friends and neighbors when they are walking around the city. They haven't hit the campaign trail quite yet, but hope to soon."
Interestingly enough, Bailey does not have his own social media account. An independent fan account (@FirstDogBailey) is operated by Robert Abare, 28, who works for a think tank in Washington.
In contrast to the Buttigieg dogs' Twitter account, which is managed by humans "as if they're actually dogs who can't speak English and don't understand what Twitter is," Abare said, "I took an approach that Warren is an intellectual who is running this aggressive campaign focused on issues like corruption."
In Abare's rendering, Bailey reflects his owner's politics.
"Buddy and Truman never make political statements, but I try to make Bailey into this progressive-warrior-like golden retriever," he said. "I make little jokes that blend dog humor with economic progressive activism."
"Hi! I'm Bailey Warren," the account's pinned tweet says. "I like long walks, belly rubs, and financial regulations that hold billionaires and corporations accountable."
Recent posts have touched on such topics as Warren's attitude toward the rich ("Mom put billionaire tears in my water bowl") and, after Bloomberg's weird nose-shake with the dog in New Hampshire, "Hmmm shake my paw, not my teeth thx Mike."
The account currently has 26,700 followers.
"People respond to the tweets as if I'm actually a dog," Abare said. "Sometimes I wonder if people are crazy."

Texto completo: When Louis C.K. returned to the Comedy Cellar nine months after confessing to sexual misconduct, many criticized the club in tweets and articles, and a few protested and walked out of shows. But the only star comic to stop performing there was Leslie Jones.
She started spending more time at the Comic Strip on the Upper East Side near her home. "They took his picture down," Jones said of that club, adding, "Mine's up."
Jones, who has talked to the Comedy Cellar's management about her disappointment but has returned to the club after a long stint away, said it was a personal decision.
"I knew girls," she said, pausing and holding a stare, "and they got to walk into the club and see him talking to the owner. That ain't cool."
Using a metaphor she returned to a couple of times in our interview, Jones said she no longer cared about rocking the boat: "I am at the age when I will get off the boat and get on another damn boat."
Last year, she exited the biggest yacht in comedy, "Saturday Night Live," and when asked why, Jones paused, uncharacteristically cautious: "I'm 52 and tired. 'SNL' is a hard job. It's 100 hours a week," she said. "Also, it's an institution. I get bored. And I want to do different things."
So she is, with movie and television projects in the works this year (the "Coming to America" sequel and a reboot of "Supermarket Sweep," which she will host), along with a just-released Netflix special, "Time Machine," directed by the showrunners of "Game of Thrones," David Benioff and D.B. Weiss.
Onstage and off, Jones is not short on swagger.
"I want to be the next Johnny Carson," she said. "I want 'The Tonight Show' really bad."
But what about Jimmy Fallon?
"I love Jimmy, but Jimmy is going to leave in a minute," she said. "And who are they going to possibly fill that spot with?"
After clarifying "except Seth Meyers," she answered her question with a roar: "ME!" She then flashed a stern face that pushed defiance into a deliriously funny kind of self-parody.
Jones thinks a lot about funny faces. She has studied the greats -- Carol Burnett and Lucille Ball, whom she said had "the best faces in the game" -- and developed her own go-to expressions from hours of testing in front of a mirror. There's the withering glare that writers on "SNL" would write into scripts as "the Leslie Look." It was inspired by the exasperation of her late brother, while a photo of her father in Vietnam is the model for her most unhinged expression, eyes popped out, one more than the other, a glance she uses to intimidate audiences and tame hecklers.
When Jones kills at clubs -- and she can lay waste to an audience in a way that few others today can match -- it can seem like a force of nature, the work of raw charisma and a tornado of energy. But make no mistake: She's a veteran student of her craft, honing her act since 1987 when she started telling jokes onstage as a Colorado college student in a contest before moving back to Los Angeles. However, she describes her new hour as a reintroduction. Since rocketing to fame on network television, she has an entirely new audience, one that's far whiter than the crowds she played to early in her career.
When asked about the difference, Jones said white audiences are "so much easier," before cackling and assuring me she loves the high standards of her black fans.
"You know how they say if you can make it in New York, you can make it anywhere?" she said. "If you can make it with a black audience, you can make it with anyone."
In the last few years, Jones' comedy has also evolved, thanks to a collaboration with comic Lenny Marcus, a bespectacled Jewish tactician of stand-up who opens for her and gives notes on jokes.
Jones, 6 feet tall with a booming voice, has always been a ferocious and freewheeling performer, but Marcus persuaded her to make a set list for the first time, to stick to the same jokes at every show as opposed to improvising new lines, and also to be more strategic with crowd work.
"She is also so quick and even when just talking, she's captivating," Marcus said by phone.
The funniest moments in a Jones performance are not really the move from setup to punchline but the radically extreme pivots between emotions. No comic alive travels a greater distance between confidence and vulnerability. In her most ambitious bit in the new special, she dramatizes texting a boyfriend, veering from angry dismissals to heartbreak and desperation in mere moments. "It's not easy to date Leslie Jones," she said, a line written by Marcus.
Being lonely in love has been a common theme of her comedy since the start of her career. Her first reliable joke involved telling women who can't find a man to visit the produce section of the supermarket, before whipping out a cucumber and later taking a bite out of it. "Do you know how many rotten cucumbers were in my car?" she said, laughing at that early prop work.
As a famous black woman in comedy, Jones has taken more abuse than most. After the sexist controversy over an all-female "Ghostbusters," which she starred in, Jones became the target of trolls. Her phone was hacked, and nude photos were spread across the internet.
Jones quickly turned this incident into comedy on "SNL," but she said that the intensity of the backlash got to her, briefly. It didn't make her stop sending nude photos. "I remember the person I sent it to was like, 'You ain't learned yet? You learned nothing,' " she said, letting out a booming guffaw.
And when the trailer for another "Ghostbusters" was recently released, she saw it as vindication for the worst critics. "It pissed me off," she said. "It feels like, 'They did it wrong, and we know you guys were upset about that little girls' "Ghostbusters," so we're going to do it right now.' "
She added that her movie was hurt by studio interference and an edit that took out 20 minutes of strong material, and she wished she had spoken up in protest.
"If I was the Leslie I am now, I think it would have went different," she said, shifting her face into not exactly the Leslie Look but something adjacent. "Big franchise, don't rock the boat," she said. "I wish I would have rocked the boat."

Texto completo: Even setting aside the proverbial day jobs — commodities trader, massage therapist, fighter pilot, neurosurgeon, waiter — a working actor’s resume is apt to make the head spin.
Take Moses Goods, who on Thursday returns to the Maui Arts & Cultural Center in his new showm “Paniolo: Stories & Songs from the Hawaiian Cowboy.” Born on Valentine’s Day 1977 in Washington, D.C., to a mother from Hana and a father from Virginia, raised on Maui and trained on Oahu, Goods has carved out a niche as the Strolling Player Who Talks Story. In that guise he keeps alive the memory of islanders who made a difference, whether posterity cultivates their legacy or not.
By now Goods has scripted and performed quite a catalog of well-traveled, award-winning one-man shows such as “Duke,” as in Kahanamoku, and “My Name Is ‘Opukaha‘ia,” in which he channeled the kingdom’s first Christian, a spiritual torch to some, to others his people’s Judas.
Even so, finding himself has taken Goods some time. He first stumbled into a drama class at Maui High School and loved it. But the athlete he still was stood his ground against the theater geek he started wishing to be. That changed when he enrolled at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, and he has been acting ever since.
“When I started my career,” Goods said recently from Honolulu, “I had a longing to hear and tell stories about Hawaii, stories of our own. There weren’t many opportunities. So, I went up for all sorts of other things. I did lots of Shakespeare, some musicals …”
Working exclusively in the 808 area code, he stuck an early feather in his cap as the Satan figure Mephistopheles in a rare staging of Goethe’s “Faust” by UH’s Department of Theatre and Dance. Unlike most, this one didn’t call it quits after the famous first part of the tragedy, but went the distance, also tackling the vast, intractable second part, with its cast of thousands, including a homunculus, Helen of Troy and the Virgin Mary, in back-to-back performances.
“That was a highlight for sure,” Goods said. “Each half was over three hours long. I got a taste of everything. My first Shakespeare was Coriolanus” — a title role, if you please, and a great one, of a hot-tempered Roman general under the thumb of his mother.
“My only Shakespearean comedy was ‘Twelfth Night’ (at Paliku Theater). I was Duke Orsino.” That’s the moony snob who falls for his page — happily for him, a shipwrecked maiden in disguise.
“I was never involved with any of the famous musicals,” Goods continued, “but I was the male lead in a children’s show (at UH) called ‘No One Will Marry a Princess With a Tree Growing Out of Her Head.’ I loved that!”
Really? “Oh, yes! I tried to look it up once, and I couldn’t find a trace of it. But it exists! It wasn’t something cooked up locally. I have no idea who wrote it.” (Google to the rescue: Michael Elliot Brill, book and lyrics; David Jackson, music.)
But maybe the most intriguing item on the actor’s rap sheet is Shakespeare’s Othello, another title role, with the Maui Academy of Performing Arts in 2007. With his tribal features and kingly bearing, Goods is easy to picture in the role, even if that early stab at it was (as one suspects it was) premature. His careful diction and the warm buzz on his sturdy baritone seem right, too.
By now there’s also a notch on his belt (just one) for “Hawaii Five-0.”
Back, however, to the business at hand. In “Paniolo” Goods is joined by the singer-songwriter Kapono Na‘ili‘ili of Waimea, Hawaii island’s last paniolo stronghold. Together they play many parts.
Early on they portray the Mexican brothers Salvador and Alejandro of “Tejas,” two of the vaqueros who brought the Wild West to Hawaii before the Wild West as such existed on the mainland. In another segment, the actors sing of the forgotten Ioane Ha‘a — part Robin Hood, part Braveheart — and the way he lost his hand.
And let’s not forget Ikua Purdy, the surprise champion of the first World Championship Rodeo at Frontier Days in Cheyenne, Wyo. To close, Goods and Na‘ili‘ili strike a quiet blow for diversity, bringing a hint of “Brokeback Mountain” (minus the heartbreak) to the festive rodeo parade in Makawao, the town that is Maui’s answer to Waimea.
The actors aren’t the only ones shape-shifting through the evening. There’s also a king-size wooden horse, which is not always a horse.
“When we did the original run of ‘Paniolo’ in Honolulu,” Goods said, “that horse was the centerpiece of the show. A giant horse! Which rotates, which you see from different angles. But it’s hard to tour a giant wooden horse. So, we’ve restaged the play with just a stool, and for most places that works fine.”
No doubt it can, if the actor can engage the spectator’s imagination. Still, great production values are boffo, too, and for the Maui engagement the wooden horse is crossing the water.
Always juggling multiple projects, Goods is staring down deadlines on his first musical, a sort of Hawaiian “The King and I” he’s developing with author, playwright and Honolulu Star-Advertiser columnist Lee Cataluna. Once again it’s a case of opening a window on forgotten history.
“We don’t normally hear about the monarchs as children,” Goods noted. “What was it like?”
Rehearsals for the “Chief Children’s School” are scheduled to begin next month. A second script, “Lovey Lee,” based on the life of a close friend, is the coming-of-age story of a gay Hawaiian in the 1970s.
“The first draft is due next week,” Goods said. “Wish me luck.”
And beyond those projects? “I’ve made it my mission for a good long while to get Hawaiian stories onstage,” he said. “Now that it’s no longer the case that we can’t see those stories, I’m happy to think about branching out. But Hawaiian stories will always be part of what I do.”
Is the time coming for another Othello?

Texto completo: Jackson native Angie Thomas, who has penned two bestselling novels, will share her thoughts on "The Hate U Give: Finding Your Activism" at the next University of Southern Mississippi University Forum.
A former teen rapper, Thomas places authenticity, visibility and the politics of finding one's voice at the center of her work.
Thomas, who wrote "The Hate U Give" and "On the Come Up," is the recipient of the 2018 William C. Morris Award and 2018 Waterstones Children's Book Prize.
"I've always loved telling stories," she said in an earlier story. "When I was younger and my mom would read bedtime stories to me, afterwards I would tell her my own versions or how I thought the story should've ended. It wasn't until I was around 8 that I started writing."
Her debut novel has spent more than two years on the New York Times young adult bestseller list. In 2018, a film adaption of "The Hate U Give," starring Amandla Stenberg, was a blockbuster success.
"Through her amazing works of fiction, she has helped hundreds of thousands of young readers to find their voices and challenge injustice," said Andrew Haley, director of University Forum and an associate professor of history at Southern Miss.
She is a 2011 graduate of Belhaven University, where she majored in creative writing — although she's quick to point out that she comes from "a Jackson State University family," where both her parents were students.
Thomas' second novel, "On the Come Up," is already slated to be adapted into a film.
University Forum is presented by the Southern Miss Honors College.
The University Forum will begin at 6:30 p.m. Feb. 11 in the Thad Cochran Center ballrooms. The program is free and open to the public.

Presidential campaigns seek alliances

Texto completo: Democratic presidential campaigns are trying an old strategy to gather new supporters. But no one is admitting it's actually working.
Candidates and officials from Democratic presidential campaigns have told reporters in Iowa that rivals' campaign officials have reached out about forming a caucus night alliance, in where supporters of one candidate would switch to another if their first choice didn't get enough votes to move on to second round voting.
Andrew Yang said in a Bloomberg News roundtable that he had been contacted by other candidates about making a caucus night alliance, but that he did not plan to make a deal.
U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar has not confirmed whether other campaigns have approached her, as The New York Times reported Tuesday, but she told Radio Iowa that the idea does not interest her.
Making caucus night alliances is common practice for presidential campaigns, according to former U.S. Rep. Dave Nagle, a longtime Iowa Democrat. In fact, he said front-runners should try to make alliances and recommended former Vice President Joe Biden, U.S. Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren's campaigns do it.
"Biden and Sanders, too, and Warren, should all be reaching out to the ones that we know going in will probably not be viable," Nagle said. "And that would be (Tom) Steyer and Yang."
If supporters of Yang, Klobuchar and Steyer, who have not polled above the 15% in the Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom Iowa Poll all year, moved en masse to another candidate in second-round voting, it could push that new candidate into serious contention.
An alliance between two weaker candidates could help them both on caucus night. If two candidates with 8 or 9% support each combined forces, one of them could become viable in a precinct. Done strategically, both candidates could pick up delegates across the state.
How would it work? Candidates must attract at least 15% of the crowd at a caucus site to be declared viable. If, after the first alignment, a candidate is not viable, their supporters must pull more people into the group or re-align with a second choice candidate.
But if the non-viable candidate's crowd moved to back another campaign, that process changes a bit. A campaign representative for the non-viable candidate would encourage supporters to choose the ally, rather than scatter among other viable groups.
Former U.S. Sen. John Edwards and U.S. Rep. Dennis Kucinich tried the strategy in 2004. The Democratic candidates announced in January that, if one of them were not viable in a precinct, their supporters should caucus for the other.
Edwards came in second place on caucus night. Kucinich came in fifth, with just 1% support in the state.
But by announcing the alliance publicly, rivals seized on the strategy as a sign of weakness. A spokeswoman for former Gov. Howard Dean's campaign told CNN in 2004, "We are planning on being viable in all the precincts. We have no strategy to coordinate with another campaign."
Today, rather than a candidate announcing such a strategy, precinct captains from the campaigns would direct voters on caucus night to go toward a certain second choice.
"That's why the candidates need as many precinct captains in as many of the precincts as they can, who can speak and address (supporters) and do that manipulation," Nagle said. "That comes back to organization."
Even a perfectly planned caucus alliance faces a major challenge: The will of the people.
Paul MacGregor is going into Caucus Day with a short list. The 71-year-old retired physician is trying to choose between former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Klobuchar and Steyer.
MacGregor said if his first choice for president isn't viable in the first alignment, he would be open to hearing suggestions from staffers of his initial preferred candidate — but only to a point.
"Ultimately, I'm an adult. I make my own decision," the Mason City resident said. "I wouldn't blindly go against my second choice just because a campaign asked me to."
MacGregor doesn't think other Iowans will be persuaded on this strategy. He noted some Iowans have spent months vetting candidates, and they've put a lot of thought into second choices.
"I don't know how powerful that would be, that a campaign asked you to switch," he said.
Patrick Pope, a 46-year-old Biden supporter in Council Bluffs, said he might be persuaded to go along with another campaign, but he wouldn't caucus for just anybody.
"I think it would depend on who they were telling me to go to," the education administrator said. "I have some problems with Buttigieg, so I don't know if I would go over to Mayor Pete's room, if that's what they were directing me to do. But I would have no problems with Warren or Bernie."

Bloomberg will fight to close wealth gap among races

Texto completo: Opportunities for African Americans are disturbingly less than those for whites. Mike Bloomberg has a broad plan to invest billions to increase those opportunities.
More than 150 years after the 14th Amendment guaranteed all people "equal protection of the laws" and 56 years after the Civil Rights Act banned racial discrimination, we must confront the reality that the median black family in the United States is still almost 10 times poorer than the median white family. This isn't a white problem or a black problem. It's an American problem.
I'm reminded of a line from Martin Luther King's Letter from a Birmingham Jail: "We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny."
This racial wealth gap tears at the fabric of our society. We need a real leader in the White House who will unite the country and bring us all together to close this gap so every family in America has the opportunity to thrive.
The pernicious legacy of slavery and Jim Crow disadvantages the African American community in many ways — from education to employment to housing to the criminal justice system. Let's look at the data:
The average black student attends a school at the 37th percentile for test score results, while the average white student attends a school in the 60th percentile.
The unemployment rate for black Americans is nearly twice as high as for white Americans, and the average black worker earns about 28% less than the average white worker.
Only 43% of black Americans own their homes, compared with 73% of white Americans.
And the imprisonment rate for black men is almost six times that of white men in the United States.
Alarming racial disparities All these factors contribute to the racial wealth gap in our country that gets passed down from one generation to another, making it harder and harder for African Americans to get ahead. Upward mobility is much less likely for black than white Americans. Of black Americans born into the lowest fifth of the earnings distribution, 51% remain there at age 40, compared with only 23% of white Americans.
These disparities in opportunity for African Americans are alarming, and interconnected. It makes no sense to me to tackle an issue like educational inequality in isolation. That's why I founded the Harlem Children's Zone. I've always believed that the success of our children and the strength of our communities go hand in hand. To break the cycle of generational poverty and give our kids a real shot at the American dream, we have taken on not just some but all of the issues children and families in Harlem face — crumbling apartments, failing schools and gun violence, to name a few.
There are distressed neighborhoods like Harlem in every corner of our country. We need innovative and comprehensive solutions nationwide to address the generational poverty that prevents too many of our young people from reaching their full potential.
President Donald Trump said last year that the opportunity-zone provision in the Republicans' 2017 tax-cut legislation provided "massive new incentives for investment and job creation in distressed communities." But, as The New York Times has reported, these "opportunity zones" are primarily benefiting Trump's family members, friends and other wealthy Americans.
Instead of building affordable housing in distressed neighborhoods or grocery stores in food deserts, developers are building luxury apartments and hotels.
My friend and Democratic presidential candidate Mike Bloomberg recently unveiled his plan to significantly reduce the racial wealth gap for black Americans.
Rather than giving tax breaks to his family and friends, he will invest $70billion in the neighborhoods that need it most. This national initiative will lift up 100 of the country's most disadvantaged communities.
Similar to our approach in Harlem, Bloomberg's policy will address disparities in early childhood development, education, employment, and health and environmental conditions. And, like me, Bloomberg is a big believer in innovation and data. He's willing to try new things and isn't afraid to fail, and he will focus on evaluation to expand the programs that work.
Bloomberg will reduce wealth gap Bloomberg also has proposed steps to create 1 million new African American homeowners and start 100,000 new black-owned businesses.
In addition, Bloomberg will reinvigorate and reorient the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division, requiring companies to report on hiring, pay and procurement data, and collecting lending data. Earlier this month, Bloomberg laid out his plan to protect and restore voting rights by addressing practices such as ID requirements, roll purging and gerrymandering.
I've known Bloomberg for many years, and I know he will bring our country together to start closing the racial wealth gap in America. Again, let's look at the data:
During Bloomberg's time as New York City's mayor, graduation rates for African American students rose and the black-white achievement gap shrank.
He launched an ambitious plan to expand affordable housing.
And he reduced the number of black New Yorkers in prison by reforming policies that disproportionately impact young men of color.
Bloomberg also created the Young Men's Initiative, the first municipal plan to focus on the persistent disparities experienced by young men of color in education, employment, health and crime. President Barack Obama later launched My Brother's Keeper, with similar aims and branches in 250 cities.
I don't want to look back four years from now to see that the racial wealth gap has stayed the same, or even worse, grown bigger. This year, we have the chance to elect a president who understands we are all tied in a single garment of destiny — and who will take bold action to end discrimination against African Americans and increase opportunity for every American. I'll be casting my ballot for Mike Bloomberg to get it done.
Geoffrey Canada, the founder of the Harlem Children's Zone, has endorsed Mike Bloomberg for president.

Texto completo: Sanders has never won anything that really matters outside of Vermont.
In 2018, a top adviser on the Bernie Sanders campaign published a book called "How Bernie Won." Its audacious title drove a story line about the 2016 primary campaign against Hillary Clinton: Sanders hadn't lost, not really. Rather, he had won in the states that mattered most, and his ideas were proven to be winners.
This is a fairy tale – and a dangerous one. If Democratic voters, hungry for a winner, buy into that myth and believe that Sanders is the most "electable" candidate, they will be making a grave mistake that could hand the presidency back to Donald Trump.
Let's start with the actual results in the 2016 primary. It was not remotely close. Sanders lost by 3.8 million votes, 57-43%. Clinton won 34 states and territories to his 23. Still, Sanders' team contends that the 2016 results augur well for him, because he dominated in the Midwest, where the presidency is often decided. In particular, they claim that he is popular in the former "Blue Wall" states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, which turned red in 2016 and delivered Trump his victory.
In fact, Sanders lost to Clinton by over 200,000 votes in the nine states of the Midwest. In the three onetime Blue Wall battleground states, she topped him by more than 45,000 votes, though he beat her in Wisconsin and edged her by a point in Michigan. In Ohio, Clinton won by 14 points and nearly 166,000 votes. The best you can say for Sanders is that he didn't lose as badly in the Midwest as he did elsewhere.
Indeed, in the Sunbelt, the other area that Democrats hope to make a battleground in 2020, Sanders got crushed. He lost Florida 64-33%, Arizona 58-40%, North Carolina 55-41% and Texas 65-33%. Taken together, Clinton trounced Sanders in those four states by more than 1.2 million votes.
And, of course, those were only primary voters. What would the general electorate make of Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.? We know that the Trump campaign will seek to label any Democratic nominee a "socialist" – a regular Republican tactic that usually goes nowhere because Democratic nominees have never really been socialists.
Sanders is different, though. As he said in a 1983 political debate: "I am a socialist; of course I'm a socialist."
The charge would stick, because this is an identity that he himself has proudly trumpeted. And 55% of Americans view socialism negatively. That would be quite a weight around a nominee's neck in a general election.
The potency of this pending attack is also underscored by Sanders' central policy proposal: "Medicare for All." His plan would hand the government control over nearly a fifth of the American economy. It doesn't take much Trumpian demagoguery to label that "socialized medicine."
When voters outside the liberal base learned more about this plan over the course of last year, initial curiosity, driven by its bumper-sticker name, collapsed. November polling from the Kaiser Family Foundation and the Cook Political Report found that "large shares of swing voters in Michigan, Minnesota, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin" say a national Medicare for All plan is a bad idea.
And we don't have to speculate about the political impact of Medicare for All. It was tested in the 2018 midterms when, as a University of Virginia study recently found, it cost Democrats in swing districts who embraced it nearly 5 points.
Worse, Sanders' overall record since 2016 guts his case. On the very day in 2017 that The New York Times published an op-ed he wrote entitled, "How Democrats Can Stop Losing Elections," his favored candidate in the Virginia gubernatorial primary got blown out by moderate Ralph Northam, who went on to trounce the Republican in the general election.
In 2018, Sanders waded into the Michigan governor's race and backed Abdul El-Sayed, a young, far-left candidate. He lost every county in the state to the more mainstream Gretchen Whitmer. She went on to soundly beat the Republican by promising not a "revolution" but rather to "fix the damn roads."
All of this means that "How Bernie Won" is basically a book of fiction. Sanders has never won anything that really matters outside of Vermont, and all the available data shows that his ideas are politically toxic. Yet a week before primary voting begins, he is surging in Iowa, New Hampshire and California.
Democrats now face a monumental choice. Deciding which presidential candidate should go head to head with Trump is the paramount political calculation of our lifetimes. In the past, when Bernie Sanders has declared himself and his ideas to be "winners" in red and purple areas, it has turned out to be demonstrably false. Democrats must not be fooled by him now.

Texto completo: Harvard professor Lawrence Lessig recently filed a defamation lawsuit against the New York Times that focuses not so much on an article about him, but more on the article's headline. The case could have a significant impact on how controversial subjects are reported in an online world.
Professor Lessig is friends with Joichi Ito, who was formerly the director of the M.I.T. Media Lab. Ito resigned when news broke that he had accepted donations to the Media Lab from Jeffrey Epstein. In an essay published on Medium.com, Professor Lessig discussed the dilemma faced by universities that might receive donations from unsavory sources. The essay contended that it was better for universities to insist that the donors make the gifts anonymously to avoid "whitewashing" the reputation of the sleazy donors. Epstein's gifts to the Media Lab were made anonymously.
In his essay, Professor Lessig also questioned whether Ito was treated fairly when the information about the donations came to light. In Professor Lessig's view, Ito's treatment raised a number of questions: "[C]an we deal with any complicated issue, sensibly? Or humanely? Or with integrity?"
New York Times reporter Nellie Bowles interviewed Professor Lessig about the reaction to the essay. Her article included a number of verbatim questions and answers. Included in the exchange, as reported in the article, was this comment from Lessig: "I don't think the money should be in the institution, period. . . . You asked the question as if I supported taking the money. I don't. Absolutely." But Professor Lessig went on to say: "I wrote a defense of a guy [Ito] who did it in the context of a university that says, 'Take the money!' The university says to take the money, and take it anonymously. All I'm trying to suggest is this: that the suggestion of the Ronan Farrows of the world that somehow there's something terrible about the anonymity – no! If you're going to take the money, you damn well better make it anonymous."
The headline to the Bowles article said: "A Harvard Professor Doubles Down: If You Take Epstein's Money, Do It in Secret." The article's' first paragraph said: "It is hard to defend soliciting donations from the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. But Lawrence Lessig, a Harvard Law professor, has been trying."
According to Professor Lessig's lawsuit, the headline and the first paragraph suggest that Lessig was justifying accepting money from Epstein. Lessig contends that the headline and first paragraph were the exact opposite of what he had written. In Lessig's view, the New York Time's actions are "part of a growing journalistic culture of clickbaiting: the use of a shocking headline and/or lede to entice readers to click on a particular article, irrespective of the truth of the headline." Lessig's complaint contends that "many, if not most, readers never read past the clickbait and ... their takeaway ... is limited to what they read in the headline."
There are two potential problems with Professor Lessig's lawsuit. First, the facts don't completely line up in his favor. Professor Lessig did say in the interview, "if you take the money, you damn well better make it anonymous." So, the headline is substantially true. And in his interview, Professor Lessig said "I wrote a defense of [Ito]." So the first paragraph is substantially true too.
Second, the law may be a problem. Whether or not it happens in the real world, the law presumes that people read the entire article. So typically, defamation plaintiffs can't base a claim on the headline, especially where the full article clarifies the impression the headline creates. And while that may frustrate defamation plaintiffs and their lawyers, it makes sense. Headlines are intended to be bite size samples of the larger piece. It's not surprising that taken in isolation, they may not tell the whole story. The defamation defendant should be able to defend the case on the article in its full context.
If Professor Lessig prevails, he may tear down a long time pillar of defamation law. And the floodgates may open.

Texto completo: Last week, while President Trump was down in Wildwood praising the "courage" of Rep. Jeff Van Drew, and whipping the MAGA crowd into a frenzy by bashing, among others, members of the free press, America's immigrant classes were once again taking it on the chin.
That's because a Supreme Court ruling Monday authored by Justice Neil Gorsuch, a Trump appointee, and Justice Clarence Thomas, the court's most fierce right-wing zealot, upholds for at least the time being one more onerous migrant policy rule change that seeks to further punish those who come to these shores in search of a new life, or second chance — like generations of immigrants before them.
Indeed, this newest legal salvo, involving the unnecessary expansion of the so-called "public charge" rule, is only the latest move by Trump to dash any sliver of "patriot dreams" and is aimed directly at those who come here from impoverished backgrounds, or who might be seeking asylum from bloody conflict or civil strife.
As The New York Times' Adam Liptak reminded, this latest manipulation is only one in a series of "zero tolerance" immigration policies championed by the White House to find a willing ally in the court as legal proceedings play out.
Previous, similar rulings allowed the administration to begin using $2.5 billion in Pentagon funds for a wall along the Mexican border, and also backed Trump's travel ban from several majority Muslim countries — this last a policy that is clearly unconstitutional.
Now comes Trump's proposed expansion of the "public charge" rule — still to be fully decided by courts — which is not unlike his recent policy changes toward food benefit recipients.
It is aimed at kicking people when they're down and, in Trump's world, usually happens to folks who happen to have black or brown skin or aren't from an English-speaking country.
These latest efforts are aimed at redefining what constitutes a "public charge," or those immigrants who are, or might become, overly dependent on government assistance.
USA TODAY's Alan Gomez reported that the rule change would affect roughly half a million legal immigrants who apply every year to become legal permanent residents.
It would make it easier to deny green cards to anyone who might be deemed likely to use Medicaid or food benefits.
Immigration activists argue that revising the rule would set more than a century of U.S. immigration policy on its head and kick dirt on the once solemn American sentiment, that long-held invitation to "give me your tired, poor, huddled masses."
Instead, it flips the invitation to mean "give me only your healthy, wealthy and well-connected. The rest of you, just stay home."
New York solicitor general, Barbara D. Underwood, called the rule change "a stark departure" from established immigration policy, and in fierce opposition wrote, " 'Public charge' has never included employed persons who receive modest or temporary amounts of government benefits designed to promote health or upward mobility."
The American spirit is in play here, the substance and character of who we are and what this nation was supposed to be about, an idealism that built this country under the banner of "liberty for all."
In Trump's world, that lofty saying is being trashed, being reduced, day by day, to "liberty for some," and anguish for the rest.

Texto completo: CEO Sheryl Palmer said the company's growth is about being in the right place with the right people, resources.
Scottsdale-based Taylor Morrison is about to become the fifth biggest homebuilder in the U.S.
Shareholders approved the $2.4 billion deal for the builder to buy California-based competitor William Lyon Homes on Thursday.
It's Taylor Morrison's second seven-figure acquisition in two years.
The builder is growing as demand for new houses, including rentals, hits a 10-year high.
Millennial first-time and even second-time buyers looking for affordable homes are fueling a growing share of its sales.
Led by CEO Sheryl Palmer, Taylor Morrison has been on an acquisition role. It bought competitor Scottsdale-based AV Homes for $1 billion in 2018. The builder is also a big player buying metro Phoenix land.
An executive with another Valley homebuilder recently joked at a housing forecast meeting that he hoped Taylor Morrison would soon turn its buying spree to another part of the U.S.
"Taylor Morrison's growth has been phenomenal to watch," said housing analyst Jim Belfiore to 1,000 people from the homebuilding industry at his AZ Deal Makers forecast in Phoenix last week.
More building but no boom Builders, buyers and investors are more bullish on new homes now because of the extreme shortage of existing houses for sale in metro Phoenix and other growing areas.
Housing experts say builders will have to ramp up construction so there are enough homes for new residents.
But a repeat of the overbuilding mess of 2005-07 that left tens of thousands of vacant new houses in metro Phoenix isn't on the drawing board. In 2006, more than 60,000 new houses went up Valley-wide.
During 2019, about 22,000 new homes were built in the Phoenix area, and about 23,000 are expected to be constructed this year because of a lack of new home lots available, higher construction costs and a labor shortage.
"People are very bullish on homebuilding now, but the market is very different than 10 to 12 years ago," Palmer said. "The run-up in building in the early 2000s was based on very speculative demand.
"We are seeing a very different consumer with a down payment and real mortgage show up now," she said.
Taylor Morrison's growth spree The deal with William Lyon will make Taylor Morrison the biggest publicly traded homebuilder in Arizona. It will likely be No. 3 in metro Phoenix for new-home sales.
Taylor Morrison sold nearly 1,500 homes in metro Phoenix last year in communities spanning from Eastmark in Mesa to Verrado in Buckeye. Some of its most affordable houses start at $226,000 in Goodyear's Estrella, and prices climb to almost $500,000 at its new community Venture at Black Mountain in Cave Creek.
William Lyon built about 500 Valley homes in 2019, mostly priced below $300,000. Its communities range from Queen Creek's Ovation at Meridian to Rio Vista at Rancho Mercado in Surprise.
The combined firms could sell more than 14,000 houses across the U.S. during the next year, according to a Taylor Morrison estimate.
John McManus of Builder Magazine described Taylor Morrison with the merger as a builder with a "suddenly massive footprint of markets stretching from coast to coast."
Building to rent, instead of sell To tap into the growing market for affordable new homes to rent, the builder has partnered with Mesa-based Christopher Todd Communities.
Christopher Todd builds single-story, unattached rental homes with private backyards that look much like small single-family home neighborhoods in Valley suburbs.
Rents range from $1,100 to $1,600 for the homes that have one to three bedrooms.
Construction recently started on the two firms' first project that's going up on 12 acres near Ellsworth Road and University Drive in Mesa.
"This partnership enables us to serve more customers, flex our production-builder muscles and quickly address demand for an increasingly appealing housing experience," said Darin Rowe, president of Taylor Morrison's build-to-rent operation.
While these relatively tiny homes have become popular among renters in metro Phoenix, Palmer said there are several markets outside of Arizona where they haven't been built but will be by the two firms soon.
The merger The purchase of William Lyon, expected to close in early February, is Taylor Morrison's sixth builder acquisition since its $526 million initial public offering in 2013.
Taylor Morrison builds for first-time, move-up and active adult homebuyers. About 54% of William Lyon's business is for the first-time buyer.
The combined company is expected to generate more than $6.7 billion in revenue and own 83,000 lots.
Palmer, a former Del Webb executive, is the only woman CEO running one of the nation's 10 biggest homebuilders.
In 2018, veteran New York Times executive Denise Warren and former Banana Republic Global President Andi Owen joined Taylor Morrison's seven-member board.
Palmer and former Del Webb President Anne Mariucci were already on the board.
The 4-to-3 women ratio on Taylor Morrison's board is rare among U.S. public companies.
Women hold one out of every five seats on corporate boards for the country's 3,000 largest publicly traded companies, according to the Wall Street Journal.
"We didn't have a women quota," Palmer said. "We went out looking for the best people to join the board."
Palmer said the company's growth is about being in the right place with the right people and resources.
"Our growth is very strategic," she said.
Investors could agree. Taylor Morrison's stock closed at about $26 a share on Thursday. up from a 12-month low of $16 last March.
