Groups of smokers huddled outside various Twin Cities businesses may become a common sight starting Saturday, when a state ban on smoking in most public places goes into effect. Though owners of many local establishments have eliminated smoking already, the state mandate will douse most remaining public smoking areas. “I really believe that 95 percent or more of Maine smokers will want to be respectful and concerned about the exposure of others to smoking,” said Lani Graham, M.D., director of the state Bureau of Health. The main issue is that secondhand smoke has been classified as a Class A carcinogen by the EPA and been linked to lung cancer in nonsmokers.

Texto completo: AUBURN — Hundreds welcomed 2019 on Monday night with a pint, a few friends and some local food at Auburn’s first New Year’s Eve celebration.
About two blocks of Main Street, from Gritty’s Brewpub to Mechanic’s Row, were closed to traffic and lined with food stalls, beer vendors and a stage in the middle of street.
Verne and Heidi Langlois of Sabattus attended the event with friends and said they were happy to do something unique to usher in the new year.
“We just wanted to do something exciting and different in Lewiston-Auburn,” Verne Langlois said.
Verne said he and his crew took their first ever Uber ride to get to the event.
“We saw the little car on my phone, and I said, we gotta go!” Langlois said. “We all had a shot, and he dropped us off, and he’s going to pick us up tonight. This is our first New Year’s Auburn, our first Uber back and forth.”
As for the crew’s New Year’s resolution?
“Live in the moment,” Heidi Langlois said. “We don’t live in the moment anymore.”
The L-A craft brew scene was well represented: Lost Valley Brewing Co. and Baxter Brewing Co. had stalls, as did the House of Bacon, which served mimosas.
Zachary Pratt is a Lewiston native who works part time at Baxter Brewing and co-owns Boba restaurant in Lewiston.
“We’re excited to be here, serving Maine lagers and listening to some awesome tunes,” he said.
“It’s wonderful. I really like to see the town do great things — it’s really on the come-up now. Lewiston and Auburn have really started to have awesome events.”
The hungry were also satisfied: Pinky D’s poutine truck served up gravy-topped fries and melted cheese curds, Cook’s Lobster served seafood and fish and chips and Salty Dog offered barbecue.
From the stage, Hello Newman!, Justin & Shelley Carver and the L-A Harley Band played.
The event is the first in a series planned to celebrate Auburn’s 150th birthday. Upcoming events, including a citywide birthday party Feb. 22 and a Memorial Day parade, will again bring revelers to the city.
Because of anticipated inclement weather, midnight fireworks were rescheduled to 10 p.m., but propane lamppost-style heaters brought warmth to eventgoers during the celebration.
Said Auburn Mayor Jason Levesque, “150 years isn’t going to be put on hold for a little bit of snow.”
NOTE: boba (the restaurant) is spelled all lowercase

Rumford K-9 team certified and ready to go

Texto completo: RUMFORD — Niko the K-9 is trained and hitting the streets.
The affectionate black Labrador and his handler, officer Brad Gallant, completed training as a team Dec. 14 in a program run by the Franklin County Sheriff’s Office.
“We’re a Maine certified K-9 team in narcotics detection,” Gallant said.
After training for 320 hours in narcotics and another 480 on patrol, they worked their first shift Dec. 17. “Niko did one sniff on a car, but there were no drugs,” Gallant said.
Niko is good at finding narcotics, Gallant said. “It’s amazing to watch. You could take drugs and hide them in a hallway somewhere, tell him to go to work, and he’s probably going to find them without me walking him through and checking with him.”
The dog still needs a lot of practice to fine-tune things, Gallant said. “It will be a slow process for the first few months, until the snow is gone.”
He said people should not approach Niko if he is obviously working.
“If we’re out at a public event or something, by all means,” the officer said. “We love the attention. Just ask me first. If I walk into a classroom, I’ll give specific instructions. But if you see us out and about, he loves the attention.”
Gallant said he can’t wait for students to return from their Christmas break.
“We’ve got plans to get into the schools in January,” Gallant said. “We’re hoping to do some fun visits, so the kids can meet him. But we’re also hoping to do some demonstrations with his training, too.”
On Niko’s Facebook page is a video of him trying out booties.
Gallant said, “I got them now so he’ll get used to them. Probably use them mostly for tracking.”
He said there has also been a discussion about doing cop cards for Niko. But that won’t happen until a sponsor or grant can be found to pay for them.
At town meeting June 12, voters approved raising $59,000 for a police dog.
Police Chief Stacy Carter estimated an annual cost of about $10,000 to support the program, which includes the cost of quarterly training to stay certified and the cost of food and officer compensation.

New top prosecutor to be sworn in this week
The new top prosecutor for Boston and nearby communities is ready take over. Rachael Rollins will be sworn in as Suffolk County district attorney on Wednesday during a ceremony at the Roxbury Community College Media Arts Center. The Democrat easily defeated independent candidate Michael Maloney in November to become the first woman of color elected district attorney in Massachusetts. She will also be Suffolk County's first female district attorney. Rollins has pledged to bring changes to the office that she said will help curb mass incarceration and racial disparities in the criminal justice system. Police groups have criticized her plan to not prosecute certain crimes. Rollins will replace John Pappas, who was appointed in September after longtime incumbent Dan Conley left to go into private practice. Suffolk County encompasses Boston, Revere, Winthrop, and Chelsea. (AP)
Boston
Several locations hosting First Day Hikes
Outdoor enthusiasts across Massachusetts are being invited to participate in a First Day Hike, the New Year's Day tradition that started here in 1992 and has since spread to all 50 states. The state Department of Conservation and Recreation said hikes are planned for Tuesday at several locations, from Boston to Western Massachusetts, and from the Merrimack Valley to Cape Cod. Urban dwellers can meet at the Old North Church for a walk through the city streets. Some of the state's most famous sites are hosting hikes, including Wachusett Reservoir, Walden Pond, the Blue Hills Reservation, and Nickerson State Park on Cape Cod. Western Massachusetts residents can meet at the Great Falls Discovery Center in Turners Falls or Granville State Forest for a ramble. (AP)
Lawrence
Chief wants Columbia Gas to fund new staff
The fire chief in a community affected by September's gas pipeline explosions wants the utility responsible to pay for the city to hire additional firefighters in the new year. Lawrence Fire Chief Brian Moriarty told The Eagle Tribune that he expects increased calls about gas odors, leaks, and carbon monoxide problems to continue in 2019. He said Lawrence firefighters have responded to more than 2,400 emergency calls since the September explosions. Moriarty said he thinks Columbia Gas should cover the $1.1 million cost for another engine company in 2019. Mayor Daniel Rivera says he supports adding firefighters for a short time "if Columbia Gas will pay." Andover and North Andover were also impacted by the disaster that killed one teen and injured about two dozen others. (AP)
Somerville, Maine
Moose droppings artist might get a TV show
A potential new reality series would feature a Maine woman who is locally famous for making creations out of moose droppings. The Portland Press Herald reported Mary Winchenbach and her wife, Deb Nicholls, are talking with TNT about bringing their poop art to cable television. A spokeswoman for Turner, the company that owns TNT, confirmed Dec. 27 the cable network is discussing a show about the artists, who live in Somerville. Winchenbach is known in Maine as "the Moose Turd Lady," while Nicholls has remained a quiet partner in their business, Tirdy Works. Winchenbach calls the positive reception of her work "overwhelming" and "humbling." She has been working with moose scat for years, and makes everything from clocks to ornaments.(AP)
Montpelier, Vermont
Vermont will pay remote workers to move to the state
Vermont is hoping to attract new residents and boost its population and workforce by paying some of them to relocate to the state. The state starts accepting applications on Jan. 1 for the program, which pays people who work remotely for an out-of-state company to move to Vermont. The state will pay those new residents up to $10,000 over a period of two years. The grants will be awarded on a first-come, first-served basis with $500,000 allocated for the program. Among the expenses that can be covered are relocation costs and computer software and hardware. According to the US Census Bureau, Vermont has the third-highest median age, 42.7 years, in the nation. The state's population overall is flat or slightly shrinking. (AP)
Marlborough
Woman injured in mobile home fire
A woman was hospitalized with serious burns after a one-alarm fire tore through her mobile home in Marlborough Sunday morning, officials said. Marlborough police and fire officials responded to the fire at 29 Eldorado Drive at about 9:10 a.m., Battalion Chief Brian Gould said. The woman, who was not identified, was transported to UMass Memorial Medical Center with injuries that are believed to be non-life-threatening, Gould said. Her condition was unknown as of Sunday afternoon. Officials are investigating the cause of the fire and whether the home was equipped with working smoke detectors, Gould said. The structure was completely destroyed in the blaze, he said. “It's going to be a total loss as far as the trailer and its contents," Gould said. There were three pets in the home at the time of the fire, according to Gould. First responders were able to rescue one, a cat, but the other two have not yet been recovered, he said.

Texto completo: PRESQUE ISLE, Maine -- Members of the Aroostook Chapter of Maine Credit Unions are facing off in a game where everyone is a winner, collecting cans of soup to help stock local community cupboards and some food pantries throughout the region to keep people fed this winter.
Acadia, NorState and The County Federal Credit Unions are participating in the "Souper Bowl of Caring," a friendly challenge to collect cans of soup at each of their locations from Jan. 2 until Feb. 22, 2019.
"Tackling hunger for our communities is extremely important, as there are many families and individuals in need, and we may never know the extent of how much of a difference even the smallest donation can make in someone's life," said Dan Bagley, executive vice president of The County Federal Credit union.
"To know that you are helping someone in need is rewarding in itself, and as a community, as we all pitch in together, the impact will be felt across the entire County," he said.
"What a great opportunity for the Aroostook Chapter of Credit Unions to engage our credit union members and communities throughout Aroostook County to come together to help our friends and neighbors in need," said Denise Duperré, president of the Aroostook Chapter of Credit Unions and NorState chief marketing executive.
"A small donation goes a long way to feed an individual in need. Donate one or more cans of soup at your local credit union. Your donation will help feed people in your hometown," she said.
"Hunger and food insecurity is a problem in The County and I'm pleased that our local credit unions were able to team up to help fight this issue," said Acadia Federal Credit Union president/CEO David Desjardins. "It's another way that local institutions with the help of local people are helping to address the issue of hunger in Aroostook County."
Aroostook County Action Program is coordinating the donation distribution. As many as 10 community cupboards throughout The County, as well as some food pantries in communities without a food cupboard, will receive collected food.
"Food cupboards are a great alternative when you're facing hunger and are unable to access traditional food pantries due to issues such as hours of operation, restrictions on numbers of visits in a given time period, or income guidelines," said ACAP Family Coach Heidi Rackliffe. "Soup is a perfect food when someone doesn't have a functional kitchen, and soup is a complete, nutritious meal in a can."
The Souper Bowl of Caring began as a grassroots movement in a South Carolina church in 1990 to collect cans of soup during the "big game." That first year saw almost $6,000 in donations, and has continued to grow into a multimillion-dollar national annual campaign.
ACAP will report collection totals to the national movement to be included in their 2019 campaign tally, but all soup and monetary donations will remain local.
Anyone can drop off cans of soup or make a donation to the soup can drive at any local credit union.
To build momentum and help spread the word, people donating soup may take a "Selfless Selfie" to share on their credit union's social media pages using the hashtag (#) #CUtacklehunger.

Texto completo: Editorial: Here Maine goes, turning LePage
Good riddance, to bad rubbish.
-- Mud
I rarely read this paper because of the extreme bias. I love LePage. He is the best governor this state could ever hope for.
-- Clasvi
The best we could hope for? That's pretty low expectations.
-- BlueTide
The media thrived on holding the conservative, and best money manager in history, to the so-called fire. He cleaned up the taxpayers' burden of unaccountable DHHS, runaway pension funds, all the while the swamp was furious. Now if history proves true, the swamp will take us back to the bad old days and the media will make us think it's a good thing.
-- mebiz Story: 2018 was rough on the Bangor Mall, but 'all is not bleak in Bangor'
Bangor is healthier today than it has been in 40-plus years. If you did not see it at its low point you cannot imagine. It was really sad.
-- Michael D. Hurley
How about some research and publication on the economic impact of the healthcare sector in Bangor and the surrounding area?
-- Steelie Shortz
Blowing sunshine. My advice to Bangor. Take care of the responsibilities of the city first, get out of the way of business second, and listen to residents instead of the clique.
-- letsbehonestforonce
The Kmart building is far from empty. Quirk filled it as a storage building and the parking lot was filled with commercial vehicles.
-- Paul Jerome
Does anyone really think the Bangor Mall will be the first brick and mortar establishment to fend off Amazon? The owners of the mall would be wise to seek alternative uses for that behemoth of a building, before the stores pack it in.
-- John Mayhew Coast Guard will get paid for pre-shutdown work, Collins says
Again the Republicans want credit for fixing a problem that they caused. Bully for them!
-- T1metravelor
You fail to see that there are 100 senators and 435 representatives that have caused the problem. And in this particular case it is the Senate that is at fault for not voting on and passing the budget sent over from the House that was approved there. In my opinion, every damn one of them are at fault. And while these people are suffering they are on vacation getting their checks.
-- Somewhrinmaine
If anyone really cared about the Coast Guard continuing to receive their paychecks (no one does) we can always declare war and move them back under the Department of Defense. It only takes a directive from the president.
-- CD1forLifeWe spent 8 years trying to understand LePage. Here's what we learned.
Regardless of his fiscal successes, his classless, vicious conduct will be the lasting legacy in Maine politics! Aka, how not to lead!
-- BlueTide
The mooch class hated LePage. He ended welfare as a lifestyle putting a 5-year limit. He required work for those able getting food stamps and Medicaid. Taxpayers love the big guy.

Madawaska acquires plaza from Connecticut firm

Texto completo: MADAWASKA, Maine -- The Town of Madawaska now owns the Mid-Town Shopping Plaza, having received it as a charitable gift from the property's former owner.
Gary Picard, Madawaska town manager, announced Dec. 31 that the town acquired the plaza by donation on Dec. 27 from Connecticut based Mid-Town Realty Associates.
Officials from the realty firm contacted the town last fall, expressing their interest to give the property to the town via IRS Qualified Charitable Contribution, Picard stated in a Dec. 31 press release. Under IRS rules for charitable contributions, a person/business may donate property to a non-profit organization and receive an income tax credit for the appraised value of the property.
According to Picard, that call initiated numerous discussions with the Board of Selectmen and legal counsel regarding pros, cons and legalities of such an acquisition. The town assessed the property, which does not include the Kmart building, at $1.1 million, with a one-year lien in taxes. The current year's taxes also are unpaid.
Selectmen ultimately concluded that acquisition made sense, as it would improve the town's goal of the attaining the best possible outcome for the retail property located in Madawaska's downtown.
The release stated that town officials plan to retain and develop new parking lot property adjacent to the new Farmer's Market and the library, which could be designated public parking. The additional Main Street frontage could be incorporated into the town's strategic and downtown revitalization plans.
Picard indicated the town has no immediate plans for the remainder of the property and buildings, but have discussed its long-term redevelopment, including the possibility of soliciting requests for proposals from developers who may be interested in redeveloping the property.
Prior to the acquisition, Mid-Town Realty negotiated a short-term lease with Spectrum than runs until April 2019. While Spectrum announced earlier this month that it is closing its Madwaska office, the parking lot use/plowing agreement is paid for by the cable company through the lease.
Additionally, Kmart took responsibility for snow removal immediately adjacent to their store.

Texto completo: MARS HILL, Maine -- With a new year comes growing periods of sunlight and reasons to appreciate both winter and the eventual transition to spring.
On Jan. 1, Presque Isle and other areas at 46 degrees latitude received approximately 8 hours and 35 minutes of sunlight. Through the month of January, that will grow about one minute each day.
By March 1, northern Maine will see the sun rise at 6:10 a.m. and set at 5:18 p.m. with more than 11 hours of daylight.
Maine is the first place in the U.S. to see sunlight in the morning, with the exact spot changing between three locations depending on the season and angle of the earth's tilt.
During much of fall and winter, from Oct. 7 and March 6, Cadillac Mountain on Mount Desert Island is the first place in the United States to receive rays of sun in the morning.
For about 2.5 weeks in early and mid-March and again in late September and early October, West Quoddy Head in Lubec sees the sun first.
During spring and most of the summer, when earth is tilting north to the sun, the sunrise first hits Bigrock Mountain in Mars Hill.

Illegally introduced landlocked alewives could put Beech Hill Pond fisheries at risk

Texto completo: In a development that may have serious impacts on the fisheries in one of eastern Maine's storied coldwater ponds, a state biologist has confirmed the presence of landlocked alewives in Hancock County's Beech Hill Pond.
Gregory Burr, the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife's regional fisheries biologist for Region C, confirmed the information posted over the weekend on social media by a local guide.
"We did confirm that there are now landlocked alewives in Beech Hill Pond. This would have been due to an illegal introduction," Burr wrote in an email.
And that's not good news, according to Burr.
"This could be very detrimental to Beech Hill Ponds fisheries. We will be keeping a close eye on this situation," he wrote.
Beech Hill Pond, which sits in Otis, has a maximum depth of more than 100 feet, and holds landlocked salmon, togue and smallmouth bass, among other species of fish. The state-record lake trout, or togue, came out of Beech Hill back in 1958 when Hollis Grindle caught a whopper than weighed 31 pounds, 8 ounces. That record has never been topped.
There have been large-scale efforts to reintroduce anadromous -- or sea-run -- alewives into Maine lakes and ponds in recent years. A Maine Department of Marine Resources fact sheet asserts that anadromous alewives pose no threat to resident fish. That is not the case with landlocked alewives, however.
"Landlocked alewives are different than ocean alewives (anadromous alewives) in that they do not migrate to and from the ocean," Burr wrote. "They live in freshwater lakes their entire lives but can move from lake to lake and [in this case] may possibly move down into Graham Lake."
According to the DMR fact sheet, "In several studies throughout the Northeast, landlocked alewives have been implicated in the decline of resident fish populations."

This four-season formula helps basketball teams in tourney quests

Texto completo: During my tenure as a high school basketball coach, I liked to break down the season into four seasons of Maine high school basketball.
The first season was three weeks of preseason, which was five weeks before the Maine Principals' Association changed the sports season policy.
The second season of 3 1/2 weeks was the official start of the regular season leading up to New Year's Eve, followed by the next 5 1/2 weeks to the last countable game, and then the fourth season of postseason, which was hopefully three weeks.
In 29 years of coaching high school basketball, my teams had the talent to make the tournament 26 times and finished ninth the three times we didn't make it. So, we always planned on making the tourney and divided the season into those four seasons to get specific things done so we could peak at the right time -- tourney week.
I was fortunate to have teams reach 12 Eastern Maine finals and six state championship games.
Here's a look at those four seasons.
FIRST SEASON: This three-week season includes tryouts and before the MPA sports season policy, teams started on the first Monday in November. That gave coaches five weeks and wasn't as rushed for tryouts as it is now.
When it went to three weeks, final cuts were posted on Wednesday morning and first team practices started that afternoon. We hosted or went to a tip-off tournament on Friday and Saturday.
The next two weeks we tried to get ready for the opening of the season by determining starters and first subs and what type of offense best suited the players.
SECOND SEASON: In this five-week season, we continued getting ready for games and at the Christmas break it was time to make any major changes in offensive or defensive strategies. During the Christmas break we had more practice time so sometimes we had double sessions or just longer single sessions.
Before the sports season policy, we also usually hosted or attended a Christmas tournament but with the current policy it's harder to get as much done as many teams play regular season games during Christmas vacation. That also occurs because of the limit of five exhibition dates the MPA now enforces.
Previously, the schools determined the number of exhibition non-Heal point games they played and now fewer teams play in Christmas tourneys.
THIRD SEASON: This comprised the final few weeks of pivotal regular-season games until final countable games, which usually occurred on the first Thursday in February. At that point, we should be trying to play as we will in the upcoming tourney.
FOURTH SEASON: Luckily, my teams were seeded high enough not to have to play a prelim game, so we played an exhibition game on Tuesday as we did before there were prelim games.
Regardless, if it was before or after the MPA sports season policy, we'd bring in former Orono and John Bapst players that matched up with our opponents to practice against and this really helped us to prepare for our tournament opponents.
If we won the regional title, then we'd play an exhibition game on the Tuesday before that weekend's state final.
Preparing for the tourney began on that first day of practice and following that formula of four seasons was the best way to reach the tourney and the ultimate goal of a state championship.
Happy New Year to all of Maine's loyal high school basketball folks!

Texto completo: The unprecedented success of the 2018 University of Maine football team continues to have negative repercussions for the program.
With former head coach Joe Harasymiak and defensive coordinator Corey Hetherman already having moved on, another UMaine coach is leaving.
Matt Birkett, who recently completed his seventh season as a member of the defensive staff, has accepted the position as a defensive assistant at Colonial Athletic Association rival James Madison University in Harrisonburg, Virginia.
Dukes head coach Chris Signetti announced Birkett's hire as their cornerbacks coach in a news release.
"He's extremely impressive and does a great job coaching cornerbacks, particularly in press coverage," Signetti said. "Matt is as good as it gets in that area and he takes a lot of pride in it. He's been a tremendous recruiter for Maine in the Mid-Atlantic region and he will be a terrific asset in that area for us."
Birkett will be in familiar company at JMU, where Hetherman recently was appointed as the defensive coordinator after holding that position at UMaine.
Harasymiak cut ties with UMaine to become the defensive backs coach at Minnesota of the Big Ten Conference.
UMaine, which finished the regular season ranked No. 12 in the country, recently completed a 10-4 season by earning a spot in the Football Championship Subdivision semifinals, where the Black Bears lost 50-19 at Eastern Washington.
The Black Bears went 7-1 against ranked opponents this season and won a home playoff game for the first time in program history.
Birkett served as the defensive backs coach at UMaine for two seasons after leading the cornerbacks for the previous three years. He began his stint in Orono in 2012 under former coach Jack Cosgrove, and worked with the tight ends and the running backs for one season each.
With the Black Bears, Birkett mentored the likes of defensive backs Manny Patterson, Najee Goode, Axel Ofori and Sherrod Baltimore, the latter of whom is playing in the Canadian Football League.
Birkett came to Maine from Chaminade High School in California where he was the defensive backs coach and helped the team to a 10-2 record. He spent the 2010 campaign working for the video department with UCLA football.
He previously coached high school football in Hawaii and at Cambridge Rindge and Latin High School in Massachusetts.
Birkett is a 2003 graduate of Edinboro College, where he led the Scots to a conference title. He previously played at the University of Rhode Island.
Birkett and his wife Sara have two sons, Justus and Massai, and two daughters, Mischa and Siena.

Texto completo: An older resident of Hancock County last week became the first person in Maine to die from the flu this season, according to a weekly flu surveillance report from the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention.
In addition to the death of the person over age 65, two people were hospitalized for the flu during the week ending Dec. 22, according to the Maine disease office. The people hospitalized were residents of Cumberland and Somerset counties.
Maine's flu activity is currently categorized as sporadic by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which is the lowest level of flu activity, with small numbers of confirmed flu cases or a single outbreak.
Going against a national trend of increased flu activity this year over last year, Maine has seen a less intense flu season so far this year. At this point a year ago, 99 people in Maine had been hospitalized due to flu-related illnesses, compared with 17 so far this year through Dec. 22.
[image id="2740023" size="full" pos="center" /]
The number of people who have tested positive for the flu is also down. Some 373 people had tested positive at this point a year ago, compared with 168 this flu season.
[image id="2740025" size="full" pos="center" /]
By the end of last year's flu season in the spring of 2018, more than 80 Mainers had died from the illness.
The Maine CDC releases weekly reports on flu cases and outbreaks. A list of local clinics and pharmacies offering flu vaccinations can be found on the federal CDC's website.

Prices rise as minimum wage increases in several states

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/prices-rise-as-minimum-wage-increases-several/docview/2161831936/se-2?accountid=14708

Resumen: Wiggins said the price hikes are necessary to help offset an estimated $10,000 to $12,000 in additional annual pay to his staff as a result of a new minimum wage law taking effect Tuesday. "The federal minimum wage has really become irrelevant," said Michael Saltsman, managing director of the Employment Policies Institute, a Washington, D.C.-based group that receives funding from businesses and opposes minimum wage increases. The new state minimum wage laws could affect about 5.3 million workers who are currently earning less than the new standards, according to the liberal-leaning Economic Policy Institute, based in Washington, D.C. That equates to almost 8 percent of the workforce in those 20 states but doesn't account for additional minimum wage increases in some cities.

Texto completo: BY DAVID A. LIEB
The Associated Press
JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. - At Granny Shaffer's restaurant in Joplin, Mo., owner Mike Wiggins is reprinting the menus to reflect the 5, 10 or 20 cents added to each item.
A two-egg breakfast will cost an extra dime, at $7.39. The price of a three-piece fried chicken dinner will go up 20 cents, to $8.78. The reason: Missouri's minimum wage is rising.
Wiggins said the price hikes are necessary to help offset an estimated $10,000 to $12,000 in additional annual pay to his staff as a result of a new minimum wage law taking effect Tuesday.
"For us it's very simple. There's no big pot of money out there to get the money out of" for the required pay raises, Wiggins said.
New minimum wage requirements will take effect in 20 states and nearly two dozen cities around the start of the new year, affecting millions of workers. The state wage hikes range from an extra nickel per hour in Alaska to a $1-an-hour bump in Maine, Massachusetts and for California employers with more than 25 workers.
Seattle's largest employers will have to pay workers at least $16 an hour starting Tuesday. In New York City, many businesses will have to pay at least $15 an hour as of Monday. That's more than twice the federal minimum of $7.25 an hour.
A variety of other new state laws also take effect Tuesday . Those include revisions to sexual harassment policies stemming from the #MeToo movement, restrictions on gun sales following deadly mass shootings and revamped criminal penalties as officials readjust the balance between punishment and rehabilitation.
The state and local wage laws come amid a multi-year push by unions and liberal advocacy groups to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour nationwide. Few are there yet, but many states have ratcheted up wages through phased-in laws and adjustments for inflation.
In Arkansas and Missouri, voters this fall approved ballot initiatives raising the minimum wage after state legislators did not. In Missouri, the minimum wage will rise from $7.85 to $8.60 an hour on Tuesday as the first of five annual increases that will take it to $12 an hour by 2023.
At Granny Shaffer's in Joplin, waitress Shawna Green will see her base pay go up. But she has mixed emotions about it.
"We'll have regulars, and they will notice, and they will bring it to our attention, like it's our fault and our doings" that menu prices are increasing, she said. "They'll back off on something, and it's usually their tips, or they don't come as often."
Economic studies on minimum wage increases have shown that some workers do benefit, while others might see their work hours reduced. Businesses may place a higher value on experienced workers, making it more challenging for entry-level employees to find jobs.
Seattle, the fastest-growing large city in the U.S., has been at the forefront of the movement for higher minimum wages. A local ordinance raised the minimum wage to as much as $11 an hour in 2015, then as much as $13 in 2016, depending on the size of the employer and whether it provided health insurance.
A series of studies by the University of Washington has produced evolving conclusions.
In May, the researchers determined that Seattle's initial increase to $11 an hour had an insignificant effect on employment but that the hike to $13 an hour resulted in "a large drop in employment." They said the higher minimum wage led to a 6.9 percent decline in the hours worked for those earning under $19 an hour, resulting in a net reduction in paychecks.
In October, however, those same researchers reached a contrasting conclusion. They said Seattle workers employed at low wages experienced a modest reduction in hours worked after the minimum wage increased, but nonetheless saw a net increase in average pretax earnings of $10 a week. That gain generally went to those who already had been working more hours while those who had been working less saw no significant change in their overall earnings.
Both supporters and opponents of higher minimum wages have pointed to the Seattle studies.
The federal minimum wage was last raised in 2009. Since then, 29 states, the District of Columbia and dozens of other cities and counties have set minimum wages above the federal floor. Some have repeatedly raised their rates.
"The federal minimum wage has really become irrelevant," said Michael Saltsman, managing director of the Employment Policies Institute, a Washington, D.C.-based group that receives funding from businesses and opposes minimum wage increases.
The new state minimum wage laws could affect about 5.3 million workers who are currently earning less than the new standards, according to the liberal-leaning Economic Policy Institute, based in Washington, D.C. That equates to almost 8 percent of the workforce in those 20 states but doesn't account for additional minimum wage increases in some cities.
Advocates credit the trend toward higher minimum wages to the "Fight for $15," a national movement that has used protests and rallies to push for higher wages for workers in fast food, child care, airlines and other sectors.
"It may not have motivated every lawmaker to agree that we should go to $15," said David Cooper, senior economic analyst at the Economic Policy Institute. "But it's motivated many of them to accept that we need higher minimum wages than we currently have in much of the country."

Texto completo: Happy New Year! I thought a reader’s recipe request should be the first column of the year since this is how this column began 10 years ago. While it has expanded beyond its original concept of sleuthing out reader recipe requests, I enjoy helping you recreate favorite restaurant dishes at home. I welcome your requests, so please keep them coming.
FOUND: Wendy Graves of Hamden wrote, “Perhaps you can help me. I’m in search of the recipe for garlic salad dressing I have had at several local restaurants…The Log Cabin Restaurant in Clinton, Chowder Pot in Branford, Gabriele Ristorante Italiano in Orange, Lorenzo’s in West Haven. The waitress at the Log Cabin stated that they make it but won’t give out the recipe, and you can purchase a quart which I, along with my parents do on occasion. I love this dressing so much, and nothing in the supermarkets compare. Please help if you can.”
Wendy, thanks for being so patient. I know it has been quite a while since you sent in your request. Chef Russ Keith and his brother-in-law and owner, Fred Stango, of The Log Cabin, 232 Boston Post Road (Route 1), Clinton 860-669-6253 www.thelogcabinct.com finally decided to share the recipe. Perhaps the decision to share the recipe was because in 2011, I featured another reader’s request. She wanted to know the “secret” to making their stuffed mushrooms, which introduced many new customers to the restaurant. This recipe is also below.
Known for large portions, great food and fair prices, the restaurant is open seven days a week for lunch and dinner. They are only closed Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. They must be doing something right, having been in business for 32 plus years.
When I arrived at the restaurant to watch the recipe being prepared, I noticed the book, “Route One Food Run: A Rollicking Road Trip to the Best Eateries from Connecticut to Maine, Plus Signature Recipes,” by Vinnie Penn (2018, Globe Pequot) on the counter. It was opened to the page featuring a Log Cabin signature dish, Chicken Jennifer. I congratulated Chef Russ on being included in this book. (More about this book in a future column) I thought I would share this recipe too.
Log Cabin Creamy Garlic Dressing
1 cup mayonnaise
½ cup buttermilk
Dash of salt and white pepper
2 scallions, minced, green part only
1 tablespoon garlic powder
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
In a bowl, whisk the mayonnaise and buttermilk until blended. Add all of the other ingredients and whisk until incorporated. Refrigerate.
Chef Russ suggests for the best flavor, let it stay in the refrigerator for a day before using.
Chicken Jennifer
Flour to coat chicken
Olive oil for sautéing chicken
3 4-ounce chicken breasts (pounded out)
1 shallot, diced
½ cup mushrooms, sliced and sautéed
8 21/25 shrimp, peeled, deveined, tail off
4 medium asparagus, blanched and cut
2 ounces white wine
1 fresh lemon
½ stick butter, softened
5 slices mozzarella cheese
Flour the chicken on both sides. In an oven-proof sauté pan heat olive oil and brown the chicken on both sides. Add shallots, mushrooms, shrimp, asparagus, white wine, juice from the lemon and butter. Sauté for a few minutes. Top with cheese. Place pan in preheated 450 degree oven for 10 minutes or until chicken and shrimp are cooked and cheese is golden brown.
Log Cabin Stuffed Mushrooms
1 cup chopped spinach
1 cup milk
1 teaspoon chicken base
1 pinch white pepper
1 pinch granulated garlic
1 cup water
1 stick melted margarine*
1 teaspoon chopped shallots
¾ cup flour
1 ounce sherry wine
3 ½ cups Ritz ® crackers
20-25 large mushroom caps

Topping:

½ cup crushed Ritz ® crackers
1 stick melted margarine*
8 slices mozzarella
In a saucepan, mix first 6 ingredients together and bring to a boil. Lower heat and simmer for 2 minutes. Remove from heat. In another pan, prepare the roux using the next 4 ingredients, cooking on low for 10-15 minutes, making sure to stir while cooking. Mix the roux with the spinach mixture and let cool. Add the 3 ½ cups of crushed crackers and mix well.
Wash the mushrooms and take stems off. Fill mushrooms with stuffing. Dip the mushrooms in melted margarine and then top with crushed crackers. Place in an oven proof pan, drizzle with melted margarine and place 2 tablespoons of water on bottom of pan. Bake in a preheated 450 degree oven for 10 minutes. Remove from oven and place mozzarella cheese on top and return to oven to bake for 5 more minutes or until golden brown.
*I asked the chef why he uses margarine rather than butter. He told me it doesn’t burn and works best for this recipe.

Texto completo: Hunger can impact the ability to get through even the most routine days. And for too many Mainers, hunger is a fact of life. According to a 2017 study by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Maine has the highest rate of food insecurity in New England, with around 16 percent of Mainers, including one in five children, lacking access to the amount of nutritious food required for a healthy lifestyle.
But organizations in Maine are working to fight hunger in many ways, including through education.
Cooking education, that is.
Maine has developed a close-knit network of programs that provide nutrition education to low-income Mainers who are at risk of food insecurity. There are two primary federal programs funded through the U.S. Department of Agriculture that generally oversee nutrition education efforts in the state: the Expanded Food and Nutrition Education Program, or EFNEP, which is offered through the University of Maine Cooperative Extension and focused on nutrition education for low-income families with children; and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program Education, or SNAP-Ed, which provides nutrition education for low-income adults that qualify for federal assistance in general.
"In Maine, we have a very small nutrition education landscape," said Kathryn Yerxa, state coordinator at the Expanded Food and Nutrition Education Program at the University of Maine Cooperative Extension. "The reality is all of these programs are responding to a huge need in Maine."
The programs have been around for decades -- EFNEP just celebrated its 50th anniversary, and SNAP-Ed started in the late 1980s -- but their offerings adjust to meet the changing needs. While the programs were always designed to educate about healthy diets and food safety, basic training in kitchen skills is increasingly becoming part of that equation.
"There has been an increase in more convenience food, and an almost a loss of cooking skills because it is not taught or practiced in schools as it used to be," Yerxa said.
[image id="2739796" size="full" pos="center" /]
To address the need for basic cooking education, EFNEP and Maine SNAP-Ed partnered with the Good Shepherd Food Bank to offer classes through Cooking Matters starting in 2010. Over the course of six weekly, two-hour sessions, the program teaches basic kitchen skills and recipes using low-cost ingredients that could be purchased cheaply or easily found at food pantries.
"Cooking Matters is about behavior change," said Courtney Kennedy, nutrition and education manager at Good Shepherd Food Bank. The program also offers classes geared toward children and teenagers. Kennedy explained that children are taught how to add colorful fruits and vegetables into their dietary palate and "become a spy" for nutrition information on packages and labels. Teen classes are modeled similarly to the adults' but with the added challenge of, as Kennedy puts it, "making over a meal," in which participants learn to make their favorite food in a healthier way. The goal is the "push teens to become influencers in their parents purchasing habits," Kennedy said.
Cooking Matters prides itself on its effectiveness. Since 2010 when the program was brought to Maine, there have been 1,285 Cooking Matters courses reaching 12,220 participants, and the classes have a 94 percent graduation rate (to graduate, participants must attend at least four out of six of the classes). While there are no long-term impact studies, participants are surveyed before and after the class to determine the impact on their attitude toward food, including increased consumption of fruits, vegetables, health proteins and water along with decreased consumption of fast food, soda, sports drinks and energy drinks.
"We track data," Kennedy said. "It's very important to us." According to Kennedy, 98 percent of adult Cooking Matters participants surveyed planned to share what they learned with a friend or family member and most reported increased confidence in buying and cooking healthy foods for the family on a budget.
Cooking Matters classes are offered through schools, jails, hospitals and other community organizations, including food pantries themselves. Food pantries around the state have opened their hearts and cupboards to provide food to those going hungry, but food insecurity cannot be addressed by simply providing more food. Proper nutrition is as much about education -- knowing the food in your price range that is healthy for you, and how to prepare it -- as it is about access. Even when food pantries have healthier food available, their clients can be intimidated by the offerings.
"A lot of food pantries are really increasing the offerings of fruits and vegetables available to participants," Yerxa explained, "but you want to test it out and see how your family may like it. Then when it's available at the food pantry or available at the grocery store, you can choose it and prepare it for your family."
The Brewer Food Pantry began offering adult Cooking Matters classes for adults in 2015. Rich Romero, co-manager at the Brewer Food Cupboard, said getting started was as simple as submitted a request to Good Shepherd Food Bank with the dates and the student roster. The program provided student handbooks, instructor handbooks, a $500 Hannaford's gift card to purchase food for the class.
"I've never had anybody who went through the class who didn't thoroughly enjoy it and feel like they learned something," Romero said. "People are really surprised about how you can take these different healthy foods and make something so tasty." He said some of the most popular recipes in his classes are usually the stuffed cucumber boats and Asian noodles with peanut butter sauce.
[image id="2739797" size="full" pos="center" /]
The Cooking Matters welcome packet includes one other key component: a $10 Hannaford's gift card for each student for the classes' grocery store tour. On the fifth week of the program, participants go to Hannaford's with their instructors to learn how to read labels and shop for healthy meals on a budget.
As the state sponsor for Cooking Matters, Hannaford's has become another strand in Maine nutrition education web. "We're a food company, so we understand the importance of nutritious eating," said Eric Blom, spokesperson for Hannaford's. "We understand the depth of the need and we believe that together we can help end hunger in Maine. That's the goal."
The tour -- and the class -- shows its participants that they have agency and control over their own nutrition, which is key to fighting hunger in the long run. "It's really important that our program's focus is teaching Mainers how to shop, cook and eat healthy on a budget," said Elizabeth Pratt, program manager at Maine SNAP-Ed. Pratt explained that classes accept whatever situation their participants and show that nutrition is still possible whatever your budget may be. "It's a really empowering approach."

The end of a mushing era on Rusty Metal Farm

Texto completo: There was a time, not really all that long ago, when I needed two 5-gallon buckets and a solid hour twice a day to feed the dozen hungry mouths of the Rusty Metal Farm sled dog team.
It was a time when high-quality dog food was purchased and delivered every fall by the pallet. A literal ton of kibble in 62 bags that required sorting and stacking in the garage.
A time when 40 bales of fresh straw also showed up in the fall to be piled in the tractor shed and covered with a blue tarp to protect it so it could serve as dry bedding all winter for the dogs.
That was then.
Last week, I went out carrying a small bucket with a single serving of kibble, canned food and water mixed up for the lone husky left in the yard.
It's been a tough year here on Rusty Metal Farm when it comes to dog mortality -- not a real surprise when your dogs are all around the same age when you get them.
In my case, the bulk of my kennel dogs were around 6 years old when they came to live here in the years between 2008 and 2010.
Perfect ages for recreational mushing or running the one 30-mile race we completed in 2010.
The years passed and the dogs and I got older. For their part, the dogs were willing, but the years were taking their own toll on them as joints stiffened, eyes dimmed and muscles weakened. One by one I made the tough decision to retire them to a life of leisure and snacks in the dog yard.
And, as time wore one, one by one, they started to die off, as I made the loving but painful decision to have them put down when they got too infirm.
This last year was by far the worst with a total of six dogs crossing that fabled Rainbow Bridge. And each one took a little piece of my heart with them.
The most recent was little Moia, the smallest sled dog I have ever ran.
Weighing in between 35 and 40 pounds, she was sweet, shy and smart enough to know just how fast to run in team so her line was tight, but not actually pulling.
Annoying? Yes. Especially when she did that for the first 25 miles of that 30-mile race. I guess she decided to actually put some effort in over those last five miles because she was bored.
But here's the thing -- she was also the dog for whom every single run was new and exciting. It didn't matter if we ran the same trail every day over and over again for a month. She always found something new to be excited about and wore a permanent grin the entire time.
How could you not love that and not forgive the lack of pulling?
A fun, feisty member of the team, it was Moia who got the brunt of the spray the day a skunk made an ill-advised run smack through the middle of the team as we were on a run.
It was Moia who, while on a free run with me one day as I snowshoed, helpfully retrieved -- and delivered to me without my asking her -- the bottle of beer I had tucked into a snowbank to enjoy on my return home.
Always happy to join in a group howl, it was Moia's voice that rose above the others in an unfortunate and very un-huskylike cross between an off-key yodel and Velociraptor scream.
Since this past summer, it was the cloudy eyes of an aging Moia who greeted me every time I stepped into the dog yard where she lived with a much younger dog named Pi.
Moia, the last of that cherished race team.
The last furred or feather critter on Rusty Metal Farm who had known my late husband Patrick.
On Christmas Eve morning she greeted me as always, front legs on my chest, head up to be hugged, then back on all fours to accept her morning treat -- this day a special holiday beef meatball.
While Pi took her meatball and galloped off to gulp it down, Moia, ever the lady, daintily took hers and then dropped it.
As she put her head down to retrieve it, she appeared to slip on some ice and fell to her side, all four legs kicking as she tried to get up.
I rushed to help her, and as I reached her, that kicking stopped. Her eyes became fixed and her breathing erratic and shallow.
Five minutes later, she was gone and on her way over the Rainbow Bridge to join her teammates and Patrick, the only sled dog I've ever had to die in front of me like that.
Thankfully, a friend is staying with me and was here to support me as I processed Moia's passing, likely from a brain aneurysm.
Now, it's just the youngster Pi out there in the yard and let me tell you, there is nothing as lonely as a sled dog bereft of her teammates, and we are doing our best to console each other.
But as the era of mushing and sled dogs on Rusty Metal Farm comes to its official end, I take comfort in this: Moia took her leave on a sunny, gorgeous northern Maine day, in no pain in the company of the musher who loved her best and after getting her favorite snack.
May we all be that fortunate.

Texto completo: A man with a history of escapes from state correctional facilities is one step closer to trial for his latest escape.
The Penobscot County grand jury late last week indicted Arnold Nash, 65, for his September escape from Mountain View Correctional Facility in Charleston when he had just 14 months left on his sentence. An indictment is not a finding of guilt, but rather a determination that enough evidence exists to bring a case to trial.
Nash was serving a 27-year sentence -- which had been reduced from 45 years -- for beating his disabled neighbor in Sullivan to death and robbing from him in 1991.
[Suspect sought in N. Sullivan slaying]
According to the Maine Department of Corrections, Nash escaped from Mountain View in September by simply walking off the unfenced prison grounds. The department had placed him in a minimum-security facility to complete his sentence.
A Piscataquis County sheriff's deputy captured Nash within a week of his escape while the escaped inmate was walking along Route 15 in Dover-Foxcroft. Nash was transferred to the Maine State Prison in Warren.
[Escaped killer now held at maximum-security prison, wanted time added to his sentence]
Nash's escape earlier this year was not his only prison break. He fled from Maine State Prison in 1981 while serving a burglary sentence.
Nash's arraignment date has not been determined yet, said Marianne Lynch, the district attorney-elect for Penobscot and Piscataquis counties.

Edward Roberts, 28, lived in a second-floor apartment off Hopper Road in Acton where a fire broke out late Saturday night. Firefighters found his body amid the debris of the two-story garage building on Sunday morning, said Steve McCausland, spokesman for the Maine Department of Public Safety.
The fire was spotted by motorists and was well into the apartment above the garage when the first firefighters arrived.
The cause of the fire has not been determined and an autopsy will be performed this week at the Maine medical examiner's office in Augusta, McCausland said.

2018 was rough on the Bangor Mall, but 'all is not bleak in Bangor'

Texto completo: After a year that brought mixed results for Bangor's retail and commercial scenes, city officials are hoping some recent success stories will set the tone for 2019.
Even as the Bangor Mall remains among the city's largest taxpayers and some key tenants have renewed their leases, it had a turbulent 2018, losing one of its anchor stores and seeing its appraised value cut by 22 percent.
But there are strong signs elsewhere in the city, such as high occupancy along the Stillwater Avenue retail corridor, and the expansions of Bangor Savings Bank, Pineland Farms Dairy Co. and ice manufacturer Getchell Brothers Inc.
As city leaders look to 2019, they're feeling buoyed by those developments while also considering what they can do to revitalize the mall.
"Most of our business sector continues to expand," City Manager Cathy Conlow said. "It's not large-scale stuff. It's smaller businesses. We filled up a lot of properties."
While the problems at the mall have been "glaring," she said, "all is not bleak in Bangor."
Happy 40th, Bangor Mall
The Bangor Mall celebrated its 40th birthday in October, but that milestone was eclipsed by more ominous developments in 2018.
It lost its Sears anchor store earlier in the year, and a city appraisal found its property value had plummeted 22 percent, to $47.3 million as of April 1, 2018, from $60.9 million a year earlier, according to the Bangor city assessor's office. The mall is still appealing the 2017 assessment, arguing for a lower value that would result in a property tax refund. Also, late in 2017, the mall's primary owner defaulted on an $80 million loan it had taken out against the mall.
Another large vacancy came to that area early this year, when the Toys R Us on Bangor Mall Boulevard closed after the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, leaving a vacant retail building. The neighboring building that housed Kmart and Hands of Hope Thrift Store also remains partially empty, save for the Bangor Market Bazaar that opened in the fall on weekends.
The decreased valuation of the mall properties led to a $400,683 drop in the amount of property tax it owed to the city, from $1.6 million in fiscal year 2018 to $1.2 million in 2019, according to city figures.
Still, the mall and surrounding retail areas have had a handful of bright moments in recent years.
Two of the mall's major remaining tenants, J.C. Penney and Hannaford, renewed their leases this year, while a new one, Furniture Mattress & More, is now leasing a space once held by Macy's -- although that particular space is not technically owned by the mall. A Texas company that was appointed to work as a receiver for the mall plans to keep operating the property as a retail destination.
Some other local businesses and organizations also have become new tenants of the mall in the last few years or are close to doing so, diversifying the mall's tenant base. Those tenants include Ten Bucks Theatre Co., House 27:4 Church ( formerly CityReach Church of Bangor) and Dream Dress Bridal.
[A brief history of the Bangor Mall]
What's more, the city is not overly dependent on the mall for tax revenue or jobs. In 2017, it accounted for less than 2.5 percent of the city's overall property taxes, and it's no longer one of the city's largest employers, according to an annual city report.
Along with a bump in residential property development this year, business developments such as Bangor Savings Bank's new $35 million waterfront headquarters expected to be completed in 2019 and other business expansions have grown the city's tax base, helping to offset a decline in revenue from the mall, Conlow said.

'Broadway, downtown, Union Street or Main Street'
As 2019 approaches, Bangor officials are considering several approaches to attract new business across the city. They've hired a data analytics company, Buxton, to help them recruit businesses to come to the Queen City.
"We hope this work will help us attract new retailers to the mall area and to Bangor as a whole – be it Broadway, downtown, Union Street, or Main Street," Tanya Emery, the city's economic development director, wrote in an email.
[Bangor considers using big data to attract businesses to struggling mall area]
Officials are optimistic that the Texas company now managing the mall "will bring renewed focus to the leasing strategy and capital investments that might help renew interest in the mall itself," Emery said. City councilors are also open to reviewing the development codes in the area around the mall, as the current rules might not suit the types of businesses that would consider moving there, Conlow and Emery said.
Downtown
Even as the mall area has experienced troubling declines this year, downtown Bangor continues a steady trend toward slowly increasing property values and consistent occupancy of most storefronts -- with a few exceptions.
Notably, 2018 saw sales of several large, prominent downtown buildings, two of which were sold to local Bangor developers. They include 1 Main St., at the corner of Main and Hammond, currently occupied by Umami Noodle Bar and several apartments, which was sold to Bangor property developer Louie Morrison, who intends to renovate the entire building.
29 Franklin St., the former home of Northeast Occupational Exchange, was sold to local business owners Abe and Heather Furth, who intend to turn most of the building into loft apartments and put a commercial space on the street level.
[image id="2707377" size="full" pos="center" /]
80 Exchange St., the tallest building in downtown, was sold to Portland-based developers J.B. Brown & Sons over the summer; it is presently home to a branch of Camden National Bank, as well as the Bangor offices of Dead River Co. and Eaton Peabody. Others, such as 2 Hammond St. and 31 Central St., are still for sale.
As far as the general business health of downtown goes, 2018 was largely a continuation of developments seen in previous years.

Though several notable downtown businesses closed, including Maine Cloth Diaper Co., Friar's Bakehouse, the Maine Holistic Center and Retro Swagger, a number of others have opened, including Queen City Cinema Club, Black Bear Brewing Co., Accents Home Furnishing & Decor and Three Graces Tattoo & Piercing.
While the city does not keep records on occupancy rates year to year, downtown Bangor coordinator Betsy Lundy said the number of occupied buildings in 2018 is roughly on par with what was seen in 2017.

Texto completo: HOULTON, Maine -- A winter storm could put a damper on some New Year's celebrations, according to forecasters.
Tony Mignone, meteorologist at the National Weather Service in Caribou, said Monday that Aroostook County will be the hardest hit by the storm, which could bring 6 to 8 inches to some parts of the region. A low pressure system will move in from the west late Monday night and track across Maine on Tuesday morning.
The precipitation will start as snow, but will mix with sleet and freezing rain from Houlton and Greenville south during the day Tuesday. The storm will be followed by some blowing and drifting snow across the north through Tuesday, according to the winter storm warning posted on the NWS website.
"The accumulation will depend on where you live," Mignone said. "The most snow will be in Caribou and Presque Isle, as well as southwest to the Katahdin region. They could see up to eight inches there."
The farther south you go, he said, the lesser the impact. He said that Bangor will see an inch or less of snow, while the coast will receive mostly rain.
Caribou has picked up 19 inches of snow thus far in December, which is 3.1 inches below normal, according to the NWS.
Several Aroostook County residents reacted with a mix of dismay and disinterest to news of the impending storm Monday.
"It really wouldn't be a New Year's Eve without the potential for snow," said Kara Fletcher of Houlton. "It seems like every year ends with a storm that threatens to cancel parties or threatens travel. It is tradition by now."
She said she and her husband have plans to attend a party in Presque Isle Monday evening and were not going to change them due to the weather.
"We're used to it," she said.
Mark Hannington of Presque Isle said that the weather was making him reconsider plans to travel to Portland to visit relatives Tuesday.
"I have lived here all of my life, but I still hate driving in snow and ice," he said. "I might consider either just going another day or maybe waiting until later Tuesday. But I have to be back to work on Wednesday, so I would need to leave early in order to be back up here and rested."

Texto completo: PORTLAND, Maine -- Bishop Robert P. Deeley of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Portland issued the following message for the New Year on Dec. 31, 2018.
"Happy New Year! We put the old behind us and look to the new. It is a fresh start offering new opportunities and expectations," the bishop said.
"On New Year's Day, January 1, the Church honors Mary, the Mother of God. She carried Jesus to the world. With her unconditional faith, our Blessed Mother saw the love of God in the sorrowful, the ordinary, and the joyful. She who placed her trust in God, saw his glory in everything.
"At the end of 2018, a challenging year for both our nation and our Church, the model of Mary offers a wonderful guide for our year ahead. Immerse yourself in God's love and respond to His presence and grace by bringing that love to others. Share how God is working in your life with those around you and resolve to let God shape your heart to be more generous and loving. With eyes of faith and hope, you will know God's presence in your daily life and it will bring you peace," said the bishop.
He added, "May your new year be a time of commitment, courage, and renewal. Be assured of my prayers that 2019 will be a year full of blessing and joy for you and your loved ones."

Texto completo: WASHBURN, Maine -- A mother and her child avoided major injuries in a rollover crash on Washburn Road Saturday morning, though the child was transported to the hospital.
Dawn Brooker, 45, of Washburn, was driving a 2003 Chevy Venture east on Washburn Road and lost control of the vehicle, according to Aroostook County Sheriff's Deputy Jesse Belanger, who responded to the crash around 9:45 a.m.
The van left the road and rolled over multiple times before coming to rest on the passenger's side. Brooker's 6-year-old child who was sitting in a child safety seat was ejected from the vehicle. The child was transported by Crown Ambulance to Northern Light A.R. Gould Hospital to be treated for injuries that were not considered life threatening, according to the deputy.
The van was towed from the scene and an investigation into the cause of the crash is ongoing, Belanger said. Members of the Washburn police and fire departments and Crown Ambulance assisted at the scene.

Texto completo: Restore Onward Program
In a Dec. 27 letter to the editor, Peg Cruikshank advocates that the University of Maine restore the Onward Program, which was cut several years ago. The program provided many nontraditional students who might otherwise have been unable to attend college a support system of dedicated tutors and advisors to assist them as they took on the daunting transition to an unfamiliar and impersonal academic environment.
As a former instructor of English at UMaine, I can attest to the value of the Onward Program for many highly engaged students I encountered in my classes over the years. I was stunned when I learned the program had been terminated. I want to join Cruikshank in strongly advocating for the restoration of that valuable program.

Clean water in peril
In 2015, the Environmental Protection Agency released the Clean Water Rule clarification under the Clean Water Act after years of compiling scientific data showing that headwaters, even intermittent streams, are connected to larger rivers downstream.
It was no surprise that one of the first things President Donald Trump did was to order the EPA to ditch that rule. Nor was it a surprise when the EPA, taking direction from an administration that ignores science and the environment, released a new proposal that significantly diminishes protections for our headwaters.
As a Maine angler, I value these headwaters that provide clean cold water for trout spawning. But clean water isn't only good for trout. Headwaters streams account for 60 percent of U.S. stream miles and provide water to one-third of all Americans.
It is obvious that big industry that prioritizes profits over the health Americans and our environment is influencing rules changes. This is not a political issue. All Americans deserve clean water.
There will be a short public comment period before this polluter-friendly rule is finalized. I urge anyone who cares about clean water to please take time to tell the EPA that clean water matters.

Fishermen becoming sharecroppers
Regarding the Dec. 4 BDN article, "Fleet of 5 Maine fishing trawlers sold to New York-based equity firm": In the wake of catastrophic outcomes from consolidation and concentration of power in our banking, agriculture and media sectors, the news of Wall Street's takeover of a Maine fishing business is cause for major alarm.
For years, New England fishermen warned fisheries managers that Catch Share policies would strip access from independent fishermen and hand it over to outside investors, bringing great social, economic and environmental consequences.
Unfortunately, the warnings that consolidation would undermine rural working waterfronts, future access for independent fishermen and conservation efforts were unheeded and even silenced by policymakers.
We are all for investments in our local fisheries that support independent fishermen, but not ones that force fishermen to be sharecroppers and sacrifice our ocean for Wall Street's economic benefit. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration must implement safeguards to protect against this kind of corporate takeover now.
We can start by ensuring Carlos Rafael's -- " The Codfather" -- fishing rights are made available to independent fishermen who suffered the brunt of fisheries' consolidation. As NOAA Fisheries nears a decision on his empire, without intervention, another hedge fund will win while our ocean and fishing communities suffer yet another loss.

Texto completo: Good morning. Temperatures will be in the low to mid-30s, with mostly cloudy skies throughout the state.
Here's what we're talking about in Maine today.
How LePage fared in achieving the goals he set in his 2011 inaugural address
[image id="2739679" size="full" pos="center" /]
--It was a relatively straightforward address, laying out his broad goals for education, welfare and regulatory reform that would guide much of his administration while striking a hopeful chord for collaboration with the Legislature that mostly never came to pass.
A salmon farm proposed in Bucksport is attracting more opposition from Belfast
[image id="2739024" size="full" pos="center" /]
--A Belfast resident has filed an appeal with the state Board of Environmental Protection challenging the state's decision to issue a wastewater discharge permit to Whole Oceans, the company that plans an indoor facility to raise Atlantic salmon on the site of the former Verso Paper mill. Earlier, Belfast residents were the only ones to offer critical comments about Whole Oceans' wastewater discharge permit application with the state.
2018 was rough on the Bangor Mall, but 'all is not bleak in Bangor'
[image id="2739625" size="full" pos="center" /]
--That's the assessment of city officials in Bangor as they look ahead to 2019. The past year brought its share of vacancies in and around the Bangor Mall, but a handful of other business expansions helped to offset those -- both in terms of the city's business climate and loss in taxable property value. To be sure, the city hasn't given up hope on the mall area.
An ATM in the woods? That's one of many stabs at humor for these Deer Isle pals
[image id="2739578" size="full" pos="center" /]
--Sarah Doremus and Buzz Masters love a good laugh, but don't call what they do practical jokes.
What Maine farmers can expect in 2019
--Mounting scientific evidence shows the accelerating global impacts of climate change will continue to force Maine farmers to deal with droughts and flooding in 2019.
This means Maine's growers will continue in 2019 to alternate between irrigating crops during those dry spells and redirecting water when Mother Nature dumps inches of rain in short periods of time.
BDN photographers share their favorite images from 2018
[image id="2739515" size="full" pos="center" /]
--Bangor Daily News photographers Troy Bennett, Gabor Degre and Linda Coan O'Kresik have chosen their favorite photos from 2018, and explain how they made the shots happen.

Texto completo: A Lewiston man allegedly stabbed his teenage son in the chest on Friday after getting into an argument with him while they were driving on Route 3 in Belmont, police said.
Allen Sanborn, 59, had been traveling with his 17-year-old son and a 16-year-old girl when he and his son began to argue, according to the Waldo County Sheriff's Office.
Sanborn allegedly stopped the vehicle just before 7 p.m., and his son got out of the car, but the argument continued, Deputy Ryan Jackson reported later. During the argument, Sanborn allegedly produced a knife and stabbed his son once in the torso, and then the two began to grapple, Jackson said.
That's when Maine State Trooper Don Webber, who also was driving on Route 3, came upon them. The trooper contacted the Waldo County Dispatch Center and told them he needed backup. Police took Sanborn and his son to Waldo County General Hospital in Belfast for treatment of injuries they had received during the fight.
As a result of the on-scene investigation, police arrested Sanborn and charged him with Class B aggravated assault, Class D domestic violence assault and Class C criminal threatening with a dangerous weapon. No bail has been set because of the nature of Sanborn's criminal charges, according to the sheriff's office.

Texto completo: Editor's note: This story is part of a series examining Gov. Paul LePage's legacy as his tenure comes to a close, including his impact on the economy, politics and more. You can read the rest of the series here.
AUGUSTA, Maine -- After an eight-year tenure presiding over a divisive era in Maine politics, Gov. Paul LePage, elected in 2010 on a Republican wave after a recession, will leave office this week on the heels of a Democratic wave and a stretch of record-low unemployment.
Attorney General Janet Mills, a Democrat, will take the oath of office to replace the term-limited Republican governor and give her first inaugural address on Wednesday at the Augusta Civic Center. LePage did it at the same place on Jan. 5, 2011, in a speech that lasted just more than 30 minutes.
It was a relatively straightforward address, laying out his broad goals for education, welfare and regulatory reform that would guide much of his administration while striking a hopeful chord for collaboration with the Legislature that mostly never came to pass.
Here are three excerpts from LePage's first speech as governor and how he fared in addressing those key issues during the past eight years. You can read a full transcript of the inaugural address at the bottom of this document with annotations that look forward into his tenure.
"Approximately one in every three Mainers is on some form of state or local government assistance for food, shelter, income or health care. While we are a very generous people, we do have not the ability to pay for everyone and we do have limits on our resources."
When LePage took office in 2011, there were 350,000 Mainers who received Medicaid, 25,000 children in the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program and 246,000 Mainers who received food stamps. By this fall, those figures were at 261,000, 7,600 and 176,000, respectively, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation and state data.
That's attributable to a better national and state economy and the eligibility standards that the LePage administration tightened, largely during the governor's first term that made Maine a model for conservatives nationwide. LePage also blocked Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act, which was approved by voters in 2017.
LePage campaigned on reining in welfare in 2010 and did so even more in 2014. At an event last month in Bangor, he called this " the greatest thing I have done," though child poverty increased during the first four years of his tenure, according to the Annie E. Casey Foundation.
"Our standards need to be higher, administrations must be leaner, the dollars must go to the classroom and most of all, we have to find solutions to make Maine the No. 1 that shows the standard for education in this country."
LePage had a point. Maine pays more than just about any other state to administer its schools. In 2016, about 3.5 percent of Maine school costs were allocated to district administrators, according to U.S. Census Bureau data. Only North Dakota, Illinois and New Hampshire spent a higher share.
However, Maine has a long history of local control, and costs were actually down overall and percentage-wise from 2011, when Maine spent 4 percent on administration. In 2017, LePage's administration handed out grants to districts for consolidation projects aimed at savings, a well-regarded but small program.
He also made ham-fisted efforts to take on school administrators. One item in his 2017 two-year budget proposal to zero out state funding for superintendents was dead on arrival at the Legislature.
"Maine is the hardest place in the country to start and grow a business. Consequently, Mainers earn on average 80 percent of the per capita income in this country and we are failing to make the investments needed to grow our tax base."
LePage's reference likely comes from a Forbes magazine ranking in 2010. After ranking last nationally for multiple years, Maine's business climate rating from Forbes rose to 48th by 2015. Many business leaders mostly praise LePage's management of the economy, including attentiveness to growing industries and decreasing taxes.
Maine has fallen a little bit on LePage's stated scale. In 2011, Mainers earned around $39,000 in per capita personal income, which was actually about 92 percent of the national average, according to federal data. Amid a better national economy, the state's per capita income was up above $46,000 by 2017, though Maine was down around 90 percent of the U.S. average.
But October marked the 35th consecutive month that Maine had an unemployment rate under 4 percent, which is the longest streak on record, so LePage leaves on positive economic news.

EWU will have its hands full with powerhouse North Dakota St.

Texto completo: First look
What is it? Eastern Washington (12-2) of the Big Sky Conference meets North Dakota State (14-0) of the Missouri Valley Conference in the FCS national championship game.
Where is it? Toyota Stadium in Frisco, Texas.
When is it? Kickoff is 9 a.m. PT on Saturday.
Where can I watch it? The game will be aired on ESPN2.
Who is favored? NDSU, winner of six of the last seven national titles, is favored by 14.5 points.
How did they fare in in the playoffs? In Cheney, EWU downed Nicholls State 42-21 in the second round, UC Davis 34-29 in the quarterfinals and Maine 50-19 in the semifinals. In Fargo, NDSU handled Montana State 52-10 in the second round, Colgate 35-0 in the quarterfinals and South Dakota State 44-21 in the semifinals.
Why EWU will win: NSDU has shut down everyone it's faced (11.8 points allowed per game), but it's yet to face an offense as dynamic as Eastern's. Behind dual-threat quarterback Eric Barriere, the Eagles (44.5 ppg) are as menacing on the ground (263 ypg) as they are through the air (277 ypg). EWU's senior-laden offensive line pushed around two of the country's top rushing defenses (Maine and Nicholls State) and can give Sam McPherson enough room while keeping Barriere clean. EWU's defense ranks second in turnovers (32) and may give its offense a game-changing opportunity.
Why NDSU will win: It has no glaring weakness. NDSU has a Walter Payton Award finalist, a future pro and a two-time national champion in quarterback Easton Stick; one of the best offensive lines in FCS history; another NFL prospect in running back Bruce Anderson; and arguably the best defense in the country, led by gifted sophomore linebacker Jabril Cox.
What happened last time? Behind running backs Bruce Anderson and Lance Dunn, NDSU racked up 375 rushing yards in a 40-13 rout of EWU on Sept. 9, 2017 at Roos Field in Cheney.
3 things to know
1. NDSU quarterback Easton Stick and EWU quarterback Eric Barriere had similar starts to their careers.
Stick, who is a win away from becoming the winningest QB in FCS history, was thrust into action as a freshman in 2015 when All-American and current Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Carson Wentz went down with a broken wrist in October.
Barriere, a sophomore who set a FCS playoff record with seven touchdown passes in a 50-19 semifinal win over Maine, was given the reins in October after All-American Gage Gubrud suffered a season-ending toe injury.
2. EWU won the first national championship game hosted at Toyota Stadium in 2010, clipping Delaware 20-19 to earn the program's first FCS title. The Eagles got there after beating North Dakota State 38-31 in OT in Cheney in the quarterfinals before beating Villanova 41-31 in the semifinals.
Since NDSU's playoff loss to EWU, the Bison have gone 101-8, won six of the last seven national titles and are 5-0 against FBS programs, beating Minnesota, Kansas State, Colorado State, Iowa State and Iowa.
3. This year's FCS title game will be senior-loaded. EWU (27) and NDSU (24) combine for 51 seniors.

Kootenai 'leopard' makes big splash After facing extinction, there are now close to 50,000 burbot in river

Texto completo: In the early 2000s, the world's only freshwater cod was all but gone from the waters of the Kootenai River in North Idaho and British Columbia. Once counted in the thousands, regional populations of burbot - sometimes known as ling cod - had dropped to a mere 50.
Today, that number is closer to 50,000.
The fish's spectacular rebound stems from a collaborative restoration effort by fisheries, communities, academics and state officials, along with the Kootenai Tribe of Idaho and the Bonneville Power Administration. As a result, a decade and a half after facing extinction, "The Leopards of the Kootenai" are back on the menu.
With regional populations hovering between 40,000 and 50,000 in the Kootenai, the Idaho Fish and Game Commission announced last week that a burbot fishing season had been approved as part of its fishing rules for 2019-2021. It's the first time since 1992 that fishing for burbot has been greenlighted by state officials.
In appearance, burbots look a bit like a catfish, a bit like an eel, with a wide mouth and specked hide - the last accounting for their "Leopard" nickname. They're predatory, swallowing fish nearly half their size and, when food is scarce, each other. "They're a pit bull of a fish," a former hatchery technician told a Spokesman-Review reporter in 2014. Adults typically reach lengths of 16 to 20 inches.
The fishing ban was put in place in the early 1990s to protect declining populations, but it was environmental factors - many of them resulting from the construction of the Libby Dam in the 1970s - that put the burbot's long-term success in jeopardy, according to an Idaho Fish and Game news release from 2004.
The dam trapped nutrients and drastically increased river flow, and warmer waters hindered the species' spawning, which takes place in freezing winter waters.
Other iconic Kootenai River species, including white sturgeon, saw their populations drop during the same period as cascade effects from the dam spread throughout the river's ecosystem.
The effect of the dam was shattering.
Previously, the burbot fishery at the junction of the Kootenai River and the west arm of Kootenay Lake, British Columbia, had been one of the most robust in the world, rivaling even that of the famed Moosehead Lake of Maine. A decade in, and populations were declining precipitously; 30 years on, the Kootenai burbot was all but gone.
In 2014, the Kootenai Tribe of Idaho dedicated a new, $15 million hatchery devoted to the restoration of both burbot and white sturgeon.
Drawing from genetically-related burbot stock from Moyie Lake in British Columbia and employing hatchery practices developed with the aid of University of Idaho researchers, the 35,000-square-foot hatchery aimed to introduce 125,000 burbots into the Kootenai each year.
Annual population monitoring was conducted by Idaho Fish and Game biologists, along with British Columbia and Montana.
Funding for the hatchery was provided in large part by the Bonneville Power Administration - which manages Libby Dam along with the Army Corps of Engineers - as part of its effort to mitigate the dams impacts.
Sometimes derided as "poor man's lobster," burbot meat - light, white and somewhat sweet - is nevertheless appreciated by many anglers and historically has been an important food source for tribes that fished the Kootenai River.
Speaking to The Spokesman-Review in 2014, Kootenai Tribe of Idaho Fish and Wildlife Director Sue Ireland pointed to its lasting significance.
"The sturgeon and the burbot both are so unique," she said.
"They're important culturally to the tribe. They're important socially to the community. And they're important to the river."

Texto completo: Starting on New Year’s Eve day, Rosa Rivera will make $15 an hour at her McDonald’s job in Manhattan, doubling what she earned just five years ago at the same location.
The milestone comes after she and fellow workers advocated tirelessly – sometimes going on strike – for a higher minimum wage since 2012 in the city and state.
For Rivera, a 53-year-old Bronx resident who lives with her adult son, that means she no longer needs to prioritize which bills to pay and which to skip to get by.
“Before it was difficult. $7. 50 wasn’t enough,” Rivera said through a Spanish interpreter. “The difference with $15 is I will be able to pay my rent and bills on time. I can pay for transportation easily, and I may have a little bit more to save. ”
Besides New York, workers in up to 21 other states and the District of Columbia will receive higher minimum wages next year, according to a National Employment Law Project report given exclusively to USA TODAY. About 17 million workers will benefit from the 2019 wage increases, the nonprofit estimates.

The increases are either due to policies designed to help lower-income workers or regularly scheduled cost-of-living adjustments.
“(Cost-of-living adjustments) are small increases, but at least workers won’t be falling behind inflation in the coming years” says Yannet Lathrop, researcher and policy analyst at NELP.
States aren’t the only ones tackling minimum wage increases. Thirty-eight cities and counties also are scheduled to raise their minimum wages, according to the NELP report. Next up is a wage higher than $15 in more expensive states and cities.

PG&E Could Face
Charges Over Fires
California's attorney general has told a federal judge that Pacific Gas & Electric Co. could face charges if investigators find reckless operation of power equipment caused any deadly wildfires in the past two years.
The brief from the office of Attorney General Xavier Becerra is purely advisory, but adds to legal troubles facing the utility. The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection is investigating PG&E in connection with the Camp Fire, which erupted last month in the Sierra Nevada foothills; the fire killed at least 86 people and destroyed 14,000 homes.
PG&E, which has until Monday to file its response to the court, said it is "committed to doing everything we can to help further reduce the risk of wildfire."

MINIMUM WAGE
Pay Raises to Take
Effect in 20 States
New minimum wage requirements will take effect in 20 states and nearly two dozen cities around the start of the new year, affecting millions of workers.
The state increases range from an extra nickel per hour in Alaska to a $1-an-hour bump in Maine, Massachusetts and at some California employers.
The laws come amid a push by unions and liberal advocacy groups to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour nationwide.

Texto completo: Valley News Staff Writer
Hanover — Mike Perry has been the head coach of Hartford High’s track and field teams — indoor and outdoor, boys and girls — for the last 26 years. Never has he seen a sprinter come through and make an impact like Abayomi Lowe.
Like a fine wine, Lowe’s career has gotten better with age. He has spent the past two weeks resetting his VPA Division II state record in the 55-meter dash; he ran it in 6.68 seconds during Saturday’s meet at the University of Vermont, one week after running a 6.69 at Dartmouth’s Leverone Field House. Lowe is also the top-seeded indoor 300-meter runner in the state (he ran a state-best in 37.52 seconds at UVM on Saturday), anchors two of Hartford’s relay teams and is the selfless leader who’s helped put Perry’s Hurricanes on the varsity map.
And if the first few weeks of Lowe’s senior indoor season are any indication, he’s also nowhere close to done. Lowe is headed to Brown University next year to study mechanical engineering; he said he will try to walk on to the Ivy League school’s track and field team. For now, he’s trying to finish his varsity career on a high note.
“(Vermont track) has meant a lot to me,” Lowe said during a practice at Dartmouth College’s Leverone Field House on Wednesday morning. “I’ve put a lot of work into it. I’ve taken away a lot of lessons from track, and I feel like I’ve had some successes. I’m just trying to complete my high school career and end it on a high note.”
Hartford’s boys are low on numbers this winter: Senior Hunter Noyes has developed into a nice complementary piece behind Lowe, and Aaron Mitchell is transitioning his strong cross country season into a distance-running piece for Perry. The Canes were third overall at states last season, their third straight season finishing in the D-II’s top five.
But Perry is sure Lowe’s leadership, both on the track and in practices, has helped turn the program into the consistent presence it is today.
“He’s brought track to the forefront,” Perry said. “Football, basketball, they all get their glory. But when you start talking state records … you get down there and consistently do this. Whenever we go to other meets, everybody knows who he is. He’s doing all these things, but he’s still humble. I love that in an athlete.
“The kids at school, I don’t know if they know how special he is. … He goes under (the radar), unless he’s breaking records and it gets reported. He just goes about his business.”
Lowe’s indoor dominance in the 55 has been in place since his sophomore season. He won the event at the 2017 D-II state meet in 6.72 seconds, 0.24 seconds ahead of Missisquoi junior Hunter Tardy. Lowe then squeaked out a win in his junior season in 6.73 seconds, 0.06 seconds ahead of Milton senior Carson Bianchi. He’s beaten both of those times early this winter.
In the hunt to get better, Lowe said he’s grown and matured. Running has always been a big part of his life, something that isn’t likely to change when he gets to Brown. But it’s the life lessons track has taught that stick with Lowe.
“I’ve learned a lot about balance,” he said. “I like to push a lot, to work really, really hard. From track, I’ve learned that if you work too hard all the time, it can actually be worse for you. I learned how to take care of my body, work hard when I need to, to compete but also get along with those I’m competing against. I’ve made a lot of friends in this sport, a lot of cool people.
“Focus, that’s the biggest thing I’ll take out of this. This really helped me to develop my focus. … I learned about myself. I know how I work, what works for me, what doesn’t work for me. If I have to get it done, I know how to get it done for myself.”
Lowe was drawn more to Brown’s academic offerings than its athletics. The athletic plan, at least for now, is to try and walk on when he gets there next fall.
“I really felt like I connected with their values,” he said. “Especially the open curriculum, that really connected to me.”
Lowe’s times are within collegiate range; Brown sophomore sprinter Phillip Batler finished last winter with the best 60-meter result of the indoor season, running a 6.90 in a meet against Dartmouth, Vermont and Maine in January. Hartford’s now-graduated female star, Ileana Sirois, is now competing with the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute women’s track and field squad, the lastest Hartford grad to compete in college.
Perry is confident Lowe has what it takes to compete at the collegiate level.
“I think he’s the best sprinter that’s ever come through,” Perry said. “We’ve had some throwers in the past, but as far as sprinters go, he’s the best that Hartford’s ever had without a doubt.
“He’s been a godsend. I’d be lost without him.”

Texto completo: The Maine Port Authority plans to invest $16 million to resurrect plans for a cold-storage warehouse for the Port of Portland.
A funding proposal comes about six months after international cold storage company Americold dropped plans to build a warehouse near the International Marine Terminal.
Authority board members recently agreed to allocate $8 million from Maine's transportation budget and use federal tax incentives to get another $8 million from private investors.
The authority wants to use that capital to court a private-sector partner to help pay for and operate a refrigerated warehouse on state-owned land at the port. The project is expected to cost at least $26 million.
"I think it is the quickest way to get the project done in the best terms for the port authority possible," said Jonathan Nass, the authority's chief executive officer.
Refrigerated storage at the state's only container terminal has for years been a top priority for state and local officials. Supporters say a temperature-controlled facility could make the terminal more competitive; benefit local food, beverage and biomedical producers; and aid Eimskip, the Icelandic shipping company with U.S. headquarters in Portland.
"We certainly feel there is a need for a cold storage," said Andrew Haines, vice president of Eimskip USA. "We have not decided if we are going (to be the private partner) in that. It is still on the drawing board."
Eimskip specializes in refrigerated cargo and has said cold storage in Portland is critical to expand its cross-Atlantic shipping business.
In the past year, the company began weekly container service between Portland, Atlantic Canada and Reykjavik. The number of containers landing in Portland has nearly tripled since Eimskip started shipping there five years ago, according to state data.
Maine will need cold storage to keep growing that traffic, Haines said.
"Space in the cold stores in Boston and New Hampshire continues to get tighter every year, and our customers are crying out for it," he said.
The International Marine Terminal could support more than 740 direct and indirect jobs and add $101 million in economic output by 2025, according to a low economic impact estimate drafted in 2017 by the Greater Portland Council of Governments.
"The construction of a cold storage warehouse would fill a critical gap in global cold storage logistics while supporting Maine's biotech, agriculture, seafood, and food and beverage industries," said council Executive Director Kristina Egan. "Maine is clearly lacking in freezer capacity, and this project would help the economy of the region and the state."
Three years ago, the port authority chose Americold to build and operate a $30 million warehouse on state-owned land next to the container terminal. That plan was put on ice as Portland's economic development department spent a year and a half drafting new zoning rules to allow the almost 68-foot-tall building, a proposal fiercely opposed by neighbors in Portland's West End. The City Council approved zoning changes in September 2017, but Americold never pursued construction. The company officially ended its involvement last June.
This time around, Nass said, the Maine Port Authority wants to have more involvement planning, designing and operating the building, instead of contracting those obligations to another company entirely.
"The difference is that we will be in a position to be, if not an owner, then to have a bigger piece of it and have a little more control," he said.
The Maine Department of Transportation set aside $8 million in its three-year work plan for the cold storage project. Nass hopes to match that with another $8 million in private investment raised through the federal New Markets Tax Credit program. That program gives investors up to a 39 percent income tax credit for putting money into qualified projects in low-income areas. Even when Americold was involved, it was assumed that the New Markets credit would be used to fund construction, Nass said.
He hopes to have the cash in hand and be ready to bargain with a partner as soon as spring 2019.
"We have had a lot of interest from a lot of parties," he said. "We will be negotiating with actual partners with $16 million in capital instead of $8 million in capital."

Texto completo: Norma Ham Merrill, who as a young woman in World War II broke complex enemy codes and provided critical intelligence to the U.S. military, died Friday at the Maine Veterans' Home in Scarborough. She was 94.
For decades, the Navy veteran regarded the nature of her military service as a closely held secret, and she only recently told family and friends about it, according to daughter Jane Sullivan of Windham. Getting Merrill to talk about it took some convincing that information about the wartime code-breaking operation already had been declassified, she said.
"I knew she was in the service, but I didn't know the specifics of it until five or six years ago," Sullivan said in a telephone interview Sunday night.
Merrill was one of at least 10,000 American women who worked behind the scenes as code-breakers during the war. The women were told constantly that "loose lips sink ships" and ordered to never reveal the scope of their work.
The Portland Press Herald/Maine Sunday Telegram profiled Merrill in November as part of a Veterans Day salute to Mainers who served in the military.
Merrill was born on Christmas Day 1924 in New Hampshire, one of three daughters of a World War I veteran. She told the Press Herald that she had not given much thought to joining the military until President Franklin D. Roosevelt made a stop in Worcester, Massachusetts, where she was working in the purchasing department of a local company. Merrill said she watched as the president, stricken with polio, emerged from a train with a son on either side holding him up.
"You wouldn't have known he was paralyzed if you hadn't already known," she said. "I decided then I would join."
Upon joining the service, Merrill was administered a battery of aptitude tests, and the Navy discovered she had an intellectual gift for pattern recognition.
She and the other code-breakers worked long hours and, at the end of their shifts, were driven back to their Navy barracks in special buses so they wouldn't be kidnapped and forced to give up sensitive information. The tight security meant they were largely confined to the barracks during off-hours.
After the war, Merrill returned to New England and applied for a job as a receptionist at a hospital, where a supervisor encouraged her to use the GI Bill to go to school. Inspired by her own childhood battle with polio, she headed to the Maine General Hospital School of Nursing and became a registered nurse.
She married twice, had two children and tended to patients in a 20-bed ward. Later, she worked at the Maine Youth Center in South Portland, now known as Long Creek Youth Development Center, caring for children she felt no one else was looking out for.
"She loved taking care of children," Sullivan said. "That was something that she was really dedicated to."
After she retired, Merrill moved to Florida and became the chaplain of the Tampa WAVES group. She gave inoculations to migrant children and dedicated countless hours to raising money for the Washington, D.C., memorial for servicewomen and to support fellow veterans, many of whom were homeless.
Sullivan described her mother as a patriot who did not set out to break down barriers for women but simply wanted to serve her country. Merrill also was a tough person with strong survival instincts, she said.
Merrill was living at an armed forces home in Gulfport, Mississippi, in 2005 when Hurricane Katrina hit, filling the building with water up to her thighs. She was among 400 veterans who were evacuated on 10 buses to Washington, D.C., carrying only what they could hold in their arms. She later returned to Maine to be near Sullivan and her husband, Richard Sullivan, both of whom looked after and cared for Merrill in her final years.
Sullivan said her mother was involved with many civic organizations in addition to being an avid league bowler and a dedicated New England Patriots fan.
"She never missed a Patriots game," Sullivan said. "She probably knew more about football than some men."
Merrill is survived by Sullivan and her husband, three grandchildren and three great-grandchildren. A memorial service for friends and family is tentatively scheduled for May.

Texto completo: A group of burglars was plaguing well-to-do homes up and down the Maine coast, stealing silver candlesticks and other heirlooms.
Two of the suspects had been arrested once before and fled the state after posting tens of thousands of dollars for bail. So when they got caught again, the new district attorney in Cumberland County fought for them to remain in custody and persuaded a judge to give them six years in prison for what could have been treated as a petty crime.
When a leader of the group visited her office and tried to cut a deal on restitution, Stephanie Anderson brushed him off.
"We wanted this criminal organization to cease and desist and to consider Maine to be an extremely hostile working environment," Anderson said. "And they have not been back."
It was 1992, and the case hit Anderson's desk during her first term as district attorney, an office she would hold for 28 years overseeing what she estimates to be half a million cases. She would take on cases involving rape, child sex abuse, attempted murder and police misconduct, but she looks back on that burglary case as one of the most important.
It set a tone that Anderson would carry through her tenure in office as a forceful prosecutor who would hold her ground. That career comes to an end Tuesday, when Anderson hands over the reins to a successor she endorsed for the job.
Anderson, who is 66 and lives in Cape Elizabeth, decided not to seek re-election this year after winning seven times in a row, usually without any opposition.
Attorneys who have worked for and with her for nearly three decades described her as a tough lawyer who ushered the state's busiest prosecutorial district into the 21st century. She started the state's first drug court and witnessed criminal justice become more complex with the advent of technology such as police body cameras and social media. She has been the county's top prosecutor as crime decreased but the incarcerated population increased both nationally and in Maine.
"She's been around a long time, but with that has been cutting-edge work," said Michael Sauschuck, a former Portland police chief who was nominated Friday to lead the Maine Department of Public Safety.
Anderson grew up in Eliot, the daughter of a Navy chief petty officer and a waitress. As a young girl in a Catholic family, she first wanted to be a nun and then a ballerina. A strong religious faith would stay with her, but she decided at a young age that she would become an attorney when she read about Clarence Darrow, a famous labor and criminal defense attorney.
She earned a bachelor's degree from the University of Maine in Orono in 1974 and a law degree from the University of Maine School of Law in 1980. She had interned in the Cumberland County District Attorney's Office, but drove to New York City the day after graduating law school and went to work in the district attorney's office in Brooklyn. She worked there for five years, eventually becoming a senior trial attorney in the homicide bureau.
Anderson remembered the head of that office bristling at the idea of a female attorney joining his staff. He told each of his prosecutors to give her one of their cases, saddling her with the files no one wanted. She spent her first day in that office cramming for a trial and peppering the medical examiner with questions about the autopsy report.
"The attorney had told the bureau chief, there's no way she can win this," she said. "I did."
Anderson returned to Maine in 1985 and started her own criminal and civil practice. Other lawyers remembered that her trial experience from Brooklyn gave her an edge in the courtroom.
"She had a reputation as a pretty fearless trial lawyer," defense attorney Tom Hallett said. "Portland is actually a town with a lot of lawyers, and to stand out at all in that crowd is quite difficult, particularly as a young attorney. She did stand out."
A few years later, 37-year-old Anderson decided to go back into prosecuting crimes and launched a run for district attorney as a Republican, promising that she would bring her New York experience to bear, improve efficiency and speed up the prosecution of cases.
Anderson's straight-talking style was obvious from the start of the campaign in 1990. She easily defeated a younger Democratic opponent, David Perkins, once telling voters: "We have different experience. I have it and David does not have it."
On her first day, she found a framed photograph on her new desk in the courthouse. It was a black-and-white picture from the newspaper of the moment she heard the election results - her head thrown back in celebration and surprise. She won re-election six times - unopposed in the general every time except in 1998 - and today she is the lone Republican in an elected office in Cumberland County. That photo was still in her office this month as she spoke about her career.
Anderson quickly streamlined operations, according to officials who praised her at the time as an effective leader who could be both intimidating and charming.
Landmark cases
During her tenure, Anderson personally handled several landmark trials.
She prosecuted Warren Cole, a prominent restaurant owner from Gray who was a serial child molester. His crimes were overlooked by law enforcement for years until two victims approached Anderson.
Anderson negotiated an unusual plea agreement in 1992 under which Cole told her all the names of the many boys he had abused and paid $100,000 toward a trust fund for those victims. Later, lawyers said that case made prosecutors more likely to take a child sex abuse case to a jury with the testimony of only one witness.
A decade later, Anderson successfully prosecuted a high-profile rape case involving teenagers at a party in New Gloucester.
The 14-year-old victim in that case had come forward publicly, bringing national interest to the trial. Newspaper clippings from that time described both Anderson and jurors wiping away tears as she made her closing argument and praised the girl for her bravery.
"I give Stephanie Anderson very high grades as a trial attorney," said William Childs, a defense attorney who represented the defendant, Benjamin Cormier. "A very worthy adversary in the courtroom."
In 2008, Anderson prosecuted Robert LaPointe, who ultimately spent time in prison for his role in a fatal boat accident on Long Lake in Harrison.
She won an infamous 2010 trial against Linda Dolloff, a Standish woman who tried to kill her husband and cover up the crime.
She handled a 2013 case against a Falmouth couple whose home was the site of a teenage drinking party. When the jury was deadlocked, the parties negotiated a deal that involved restitution and community service.
The Maine Judicial Branch does not track conviction rates. A fraction of the 10,000 cases that move through the district attorney's office in a given year go to trial. Many of the others result in plea deals, often involving guilty pleas for reduced charges.
Anderson oversees a staff of more than 50 people. That includes 20 attorneys, which Anderson believes is more than double the number when she started in 1991.
"She let you handle your cases the way you thought they should be handled," said Meg Elam, who worked in the Cumberland County District Attorney's Office for nearly three decades before she left for the Maine Attorney General's Office in 2015. "That was a gift to all of us that worked with her, that she trusted our judgment."
Anderson also clashed at times with other leaders in law enforcement, occasionally giving public glimpses of her ability to talk tough and push back.
In 1993, Portland's outspoken police chief, Michael Chitwood, held a news conference with leaders of the Maine NAACP criticizing Anderson for not aggressively pursuing crimes against minorities. Anderson angrily responded with her own press briefing detailing her office's actions on several cases.
"If Chief Chitwood spent as much time acquainting himself with the facts as he does holding press conferences, there would be a lot more peace in Cumberland County," she told news reporters.
She opposed Mark Dion's bid for re-election as Cumberland County sheriff in 2002, saying he lacked character. Dion, a Democrat, won the second term anyway.
"She definitely was a critic, there was no question about that," Dion said. "But it kind of makes you smile, a little bit of smirk, because that's her. That's just how she approaches it." And, he said, it was never personal.
After the election, Anderson called Dion and told him that she wanted to work together with him for the sake of the county, he said. Anderson's style of direct, no-nonsense communication could be off-putting, but came from a place of genuine belief in her positions, Dion said.
"She never seemed to me to be someone who worried about political wind," he said. "She was aware of it, but I think she had integrity in her decision-making."
The current sheriff, Kevin Joyce, credited her with making the criminal justice system more efficient over time, implementing ideas like a unified criminal docket and a bad-check enforcement program.
Sauschuck, who was the Portland police chief from 2012 until earlier this year, praised her open-door policy for officers who disagreed with her charging decisions or who had questions about a case.
Longtime defense attorneys described her as pragmatic and fair, tough but willing to negotiate.
Hallett spoke highly of Anderson and said she will be missed, but also pointed to a recent case as an example of how they disagreed over the years.
He represented a Black Lives Matter protester who was arrested in 2016 after taking part in a demonstration that blocked Commercial Street in Portland to protest police shootings of black men nationwide. When an attempt at a restorative justice meeting failed, the parties traded blame.
"I think as time went on, she became more closed-minded," Hallett said. "That's what I thought I saw in the Black Lives Matter case. I think being a prosecutor for a really long time is hard. Everything becomes a little more black and white. Defense lawyers, we live in a world of gray."
In recent years, Anderson has opposed some new ideas that are being tested in other states, such as eliminating a cash bail system that critics say forces poor people to languish in jail while others do not. But she is also described as an innovator, in particular for her decision to bring drug court to Maine in 1998.
The first drug court started in Florida in 1989. The specialized programs focus on cases that involve alcohol or drug dependency and provide flexibility and support, such as treatment and monitoring.
During her second term, Anderson secured more than $300,000 in federal grant money to start a similar program in Cumberland County. Defense attorney Neale Duffett served on the planning committee for what was called Project Exodus, which Anderson named in a nod to the Old Testament.
"It was well received," Duffett said. "Judges liked it, defense lawyers liked it and prosecutors liked it."
Adult drug treatment courts now operate in five counties in Maine, and the state has created similar court programs for child protective cases and other dockets. The total budget for drug treatment courts in Maine is $2.2 million during this fiscal year, according to a spokeswoman from the Maine Department of Health and Human Services.
But Anderson has long bemoaned a lack of resources allocated to the program, and she even called for its end five years ago during a dispute over the enforcement of probation violations. She argued that the program wouldn't work without a real threat of incarceration.
"If it can't be done right, it shouldn't be done at all," Anderson told the Press Herald in 2013.
Gov. Paul LePage ultimately intervened to stop the drug court from fizzling out. Since then, a probation officer has been dedicated to the county's drug court. Still, Anderson said she has become less convinced over the years that every person who is addicted to drugs is interested in quitting them.
"Yes, we need more treatment," Anderson said. "But ... I question, frankly, how many people want to live a life free from the bondage of addiction."
Kristine Hanly, the defense attorney liaison for all drug court participants, credited Anderson with starting the drug court and fighting for resources.
Hanly also said the court has evolved in recent years with new research on addiction and new treatments, even if the criminal justice system in Maine and across the country still struggles to shake the idea that relapse is a failure rather than a common occurrence on the path to recovery.
"The science just doesn't support that," she said.
what's next
Anderson will soon begin a new role as the executive director of the Maine Prosecutors Association.
Meanwhile, her old job will be taken over by the man she endorsed for it, Assistant District Attorney Jonathan Sahrbeck.
An unenrolled candidate, Sahrbeck won by default when the two other candidates in the general election dropped out. Republican Randall Bates withdrew from the race in September, saying the time wasn't right for him. Democrat Jon Gale dropped out just days before the November election because of allegations of sexual misconduct.
Sahrbeck has said he wants to make the role of district attorney more visible in the community, but will continue many of his predecessor's policies once he takes office in January.

Keep pupils working on Maine's snow days The state inexplicably shuts the door on a remote school day pilot project.

Texto completo: It snows in Maine. Sometimes a lot. Sometimes it starts in November, and sometimes it doesn't end until April.
With so much snow, you'd think Maine would be at the forefront of an effort to end snow days as we know them by allowing students to work remotely from home.
You'd be wrong.
While a few states have already put "remote school days" in place, the idea hasn't really caught on in Maine - and it seems like the state Department of Education may be getting in the way.
In the Camden-Rockport area, School Administrative District 28 and the Five Town Community School District together were set to launch a remote school day pilot project on Dec. 1 but were told to hold off by state officials, who said the districts hadn't met a series of stiff requirements. Instead, the state said, the schools have to wait until there have been at least five snow days to implement the new initiative.
We're sure the DOE has its reasons, but the decision seems to go against the idea of home rule and experimentation within reason. After all, the Camden-area schools had worked on the initiative for a while, they were eager to try it out and their experience could have provided valuable lessons to other districts looking to do the same.
And there should be plenty of those. Snow days not only upset the school calendar, but also disrupt learning. Snow days take school days away during a time when, because of holidays and vacations, there are already a lot of breaks.
If there are too many snow days, days are tacked on to the end of the year, when it's hot in the classroom and students are paying more attention to the coming summer than to their studies.
And when we send kids to school so few days when compared to other countries, we can't afford to lose any.
Of course, there are challenges. Not every student has internet access at home, and some subjects require close instruction that is hard to replicate remotely.
And we imagine some parents, remembering their own youth, believe in the value of a good snow day.
But those challenges can be overcome. Some schools pre-load assignments onto student laptops so that the internet is not necessary, or they show the students how to use a cellphone hotspot to get internet at home, as the Camden-area schools had planned.
Others use creative online portals for instruction, or, if in-person help is necessary, provide a few extra days after the day off to turn in an assignment.
As for the romantic view of snow days, that's for local school boards and parents to hash out.
More school districts should give remote school days a chance, and the state should help them do it.
The rules for charter schools are looser than for other public schools, and Baxter Academy for Technology and Science, a Portland-based charter school, has used remote days for a while, and they are popular - this shows how it can work.
Remote school days are also popular in other states, including South Carolina, where a pilot project is underway.
If even a state in the South can figure out how to work on snow days, so can Maine.

Lyme disease loosens its grip on Maine Researchers are investigating whether the hot, dry summer caused a big decline in reported cases. The numbers belie years of increases and a record total in 2017.

Texto completo: Maine experienced a dramatic drop-off in reported Lyme disease cases in 2018, and the dry weather this past summer may have played a role.
The state recorded 1,310 Lyme cases through Dec. 27, according to the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention, down from 1,852 in 2017. That represents a 29 percent decrease, although the final number of cases may rise slightly because of a lag in reporting.
Lyme is an infectious disease caused by the deer tick, which has expanded its range in Maine over the past 20 years. Lyme disease cases had climbed every year in Maine since 2011 - except for 2015 - before falling off in 2018.
The 1,852 Lyme cases in 2017 represented an all-time high, and the tick-borne illness has persisted in Maine as a public health threat, as there have been more than 1,000 reported cases per year since 2011. Lyme disease can cause flu-like symptoms, swelling, neurological problems like Bell's palsy and joint pain.
Some, but not all, people get a bull's-eye rash where they were bitten by a tick. If caught early, Lyme disease can be treated with antibiotics, but untreated it can cause long-term health problems, especially in the joints and nervous system, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Anaplasmosis, another disease caused by the deer tick, also experienced a sharp decline in 2018, from 663 cases in 2017 to 476 cases through Dec. 27 this year.
Researchers are still learning about what causes fluctuations in deer tick populations and interactions with humans. In addition to Lyme cases being down, there were fewer dead tick submissions to the University of Maine Cooperative Extension, and fewer ticks showing up in field surveys conducted by Maine Medical Center Research Institute staff.
"The big challenge for tick survival may not be the winter, but may be the summer," said Susan Elias, a research associate at the Maine Medical Center Research Institute in Scarborough, which studies the arachnids and Lyme disease.
Rainfall was below average this summer, while high temperatures in July and August were higher than average, according to the National Weather Service in Gray.
Elias said researchers have been examining how the deer tick survives in its southern range, such as Georgia or South Carolina. In the South, the ticks can survive in the hot weather, but they stay below leaf litter and do not seek humans as hosts as frequently, instead preferring low-traveling animals like lizards, she said.
"Ticks are like Goldilocks. It can't be too hot or too cold or too dry. It has to be just right," Elias said. "But they are experts at finding the right microclimate for them, so if it's too hot and dry, for instance, they will retreat under the leaf litter."
Still, if the weather is hot and dry enough for an extended period, that could lead to reduced tick populations, researchers say.
Researchers will compare Maine's dry summer of 2016 with this year's summer, looking at humidity and temperature patterns, to see if there's any correlation with tick activity. In 2016, Lyme cases were down in the summer but came back stronger in the fall, and Maine ended up with 1,464 cases that year.
This year, Lyme cases started strong in the spring and early summer but fell off in the late summer, compared to previous years, and did not rebound in the fall, as they did in 2016.
Extreme cold temperatures without snow can also kill ticks, but the temperatures have to be consistently below or near 0 degrees Fahrenheit for weeks before researchers believe tick populations would be significantly affected. Snow acts as an insulator and helps ticks survive the winter.
Griffin Dill, integrated pest management professional at the University of Maine Cooperative Extension, said it's difficult to tell whether 2017 was an aberration or whether 2018 represents a one-year drop-off before Lyme cases climb again.
Dill said there were 20 percent fewer tick identification submissions to the University of Maine's "tick lab" this year, with a steeper decline in the fall. People who are bitten by ticks can submit them to the lab for identification.
"Fall is usually a very active time for ticks, but not this year," Dill said. "There also may not have been as many opportunities for tick-human interactions."
Dill said the snow and colder temperatures that arrived in November probably reduced tick activity at a time when people were still outside. For instance, hunters may have come across fewer active ticks.
"In those conditions, there's not going to be a lot of tick activity," he said.
Researchers are also studying how Lyme may correlate with the rodent population. Maine had an abundance of squirrels in 2018, probably caused by a higher-than-normal acorn crop in 2017. The theory is that the increased rodent population this year will result in more ticks next year, but Dill said he's skeptical of that, and more research is needed.

Texto completo: VASSALBORO -- New streetlights are expected to line Vassalboro's roads in the coming months, replacing existing lamps, installed as early as 1921, with energy-efficient LED fixtures.
Unlike other towns in Maine doing so, though, Vassalboro has decided to go through Central Maine Power Co. for the conversion project in order to avoid maintenance responsibilities and costs.
In November, selectmen unanimously voted to pursue a contract with CMP to replace the lights at no cost and enter into a 15-year lease for the fixtures. The town is expected to save $4,417.91 annually as a result.
"CMP said they will likely not be able to do anything for us until the second quarter of next calendar year, so April or May," Town Manager Mary Sabins said. But the CMP representative "didn't nail down an exact date or time. She said they'd be in contact."
Had the Board of Selectmen opted to put the project out to bid, the town potentially could have saved more money in the long term. However, Vassalboro would face an upfront expense of $8,780 - the combined cost of buying the current 111 lights from the electric utility plus the amount of tax revenue Vassalboro would lose as a result. It also would have to buy the new light-emitting diode fixtures and pay a contractor to install them.
Working with CMP allows the town to avoid these costs, though it still would pay the company to lease the LEDs for a decade and a half. Vassalboro CMP account manager Tammy Pierce informed Sabins in a Nov. 5 email that "there is no cost to the Town to install these LED lights and because the average age of the existing lights is greater than 15 years," the cost to remove them "would be $0."
CMP also would continue to pay the town taxes on the lights. Lauchlin Titus, chairman of the selectmen, noted that the payback period on the LEDs would range from five to seven years.
"CMP ... makes the most sense to me," Selectman Robert Browne said at a Nov. 15 meeting. "We'd still have some savings. We don't have to maintain (the lights). I don't know if we'd have more savings by putting it out (to bid), but we are saving money. We still get taxes on it. To my mind, I like the CMP option."
Titus agreed.
"I'm willing to take small pieces when I can get small pieces," he said.
The chief concern of the selectmen was that if Vassalboro contracted with a different company for the LED installation, the town would be responsible for maintaining the lights, which it is not equipped to do. Vassalboro would have to hire a licensed electrician whenever a light was in need of repair. The arrangement with CMP includes repair and servicing.
"To my mind, my concern all along with this has been I don't want us maintaining that," Browne said. He said he doesn't envision Eugene Field, the public works foreman, "being up on a ladder trying to fix a light. That's not something that I want to see."
Regardless of what company installed the new lights, switching from high-pressure sodium lights to LEDs will save Vassalboro money on energy. CMP spokeswoman Catharine Hartnett said LEDs "offer 30 percent to 50 percent energy savings as compared to conventional high-pressure sodium streetlights."
A quote from Pierce notes that Vassalboro's current energy supply costs are $4,167 annually and would be reduced to about $1,409 a year with the transition to LEDs. These rates are calculated based on energy consumption. The current delivery and lease fees Vassalboro pays CMP are $13,939 per year, and with the LEDs, that number would decrease to $12,279, according to Pierce. In total, the town's annual streetlight expenses would drop from $18,107 to about $13,698.
Hartnett declined to comment on how many towns and cities are working with CMP on streetlight conversion projects, noting that "many of our municipal partners (are) considering entering into new 15-year agreements as well as purchasing streetlights."
Sabins said that in her communications with the company about LED installation quotes, a representative expressed that "CMP is being inundated with these types of requests."
The company first began installing LEDs in 2017, according to Hartnett. Vassalboro has been looking to replace its streetlights with more energy-efficient fixtures for at least two years.
"When we first looked at it, CMP was not even in the market, and now CMP is coming around because there's a lot of large municipalities that are making that switch," Titus said. "Now CMP's like, 'Oh, wait a minute, maybe we'll play.' "

County governments could make local-option taxes work

Texto completo: SEBAGO -- I was pleased to see your recent editorial in support of state Rep. Mike Sylvester's proposal to allow municipalities to enact a local-option sales tax (Our View, Dec. 4). Kudos to Rep. Sylvester for putting this important issue in front of the Legislature. As your editorial points out, almost every state in the nation has adopted local-option sales tax legislation.
The fact remains that local property taxes in Maine carry a disproportionate burden of the cost of local services. This is a drag on Maine's economy, hurting homeowners, renters and businesses. If the governor and Legislature are not willing to finally honor the statutory funding levels for the municipal revenue sharing program and the 2004 citizen-approved school funding formula, they should at least adopt legislation that would allow for a municipal-regional partnership to broaden revenue sources through a local-option sales tax.
As I understand Rep. Sylvester's proposal, municipalities collecting the sales tax would distribute 15 percent to outlying towns. The concept of sharing is laudable and needs to be a feature of any program, but how would that formula actually work? Why 15 percent, and how far out is an outlying community?
As an alternative, I would encourage the Legislature to authorize county governments to serve as the mechanism through which a regional local-option sales tax could be managed. Under such an approach, counties would be empowered to serve as the legal entity through which a municipality or a group of municipalities - assisted, perhaps, through a regional planning organization - could submit for voter approval a proposed capital improvement program, to be funded in part or whole by a local-option sales tax.
By restricting the local-option sales tax to just infrastructure, municipal and county officials would have every incentive to structure a proposal to ensure that all areas within the political boundary of the county would benefit. Examples of eligible infrastructure could include roads, sidewalks, culverts, public trails, Wi-Fi and technology. Sales tax revenue could be used to leverage other resources, including state and federal funds or additional funds that a municipality might independently decide to contribute to a specific project within the capital improvement program.
Why use county government? There are a number of legal and practical reasons. With close to 500 municipalities in Maine wrapped into 16 counties, efficiency alone is a persuasive reason. Legally, counties are governed through a publicly elected board of commissioners who represent all geographic regions within a county. As well, over the last few years, Maine's counties have become professionally staffed with the systems and capacity to manage a range of public services.
Of further relevance, infrastructure investments are most effective when planned and implemented regionally. To this point, consider regional growth data. In 1960, the urban core cities of Portland, South Portland and Westbrook combined made up 60 percent of Cumberland County's population. By 2010, they made up just 40 percent of the county's population. In just the Lakes Region alone, nine towns grew from 8 percent to 20 percent of Cumberland County's total population.
It has now been over 12 years since the Brookings Institution report "Charting Maine's Future" was released. On the critical issue of tax reform, Brookings noted that "it will be imperative for leaders to address once and for all the tax code's extreme overreliance on property taxes and its overly narrow sales-tax base." Consistent with the Press Herald's recent editorial, Brookings went on to advocate that "Maine must move to broaden its revenue base by 'exporting' more tax burden onto Maine's millions of visitors and tourists."
We have a new governor and a new Legislature. Will they be caretakers or will they be change agents? I hope the latter, and to that end I encourage them to dust off the Brookings report and get to work on tax reform, because it is arguably more "imperative" than ever. After decades of talk, maintaining the status quo is at best a mediocre strategy. We can do far better, but it will take strong leadership and a shared commitment by our leaders and citizens to make it happen.

Investigators discover body in ruins from fire
A man's body was discovered early Sunday in the debris of a fire that broke out in an Acton building Saturday night.
The State Fire Marshal's Office said Sunday night that the victim is believed to be Edward Roberts, 28.
The fire destroyed a garage and a second-floor apartment on Hopper Road.
The blaze broke out shortly before 9 p.m. and was reported by neighbors and passing motorists.
The apartment was engulfed in flames when firefighters arrived, according to the fire marshal's office.
The victim's body was recovered from the rubble early Sunday by a team of fire investigators.
"Fire investigators say no cause for the fire has been determined and more work will need to be done," Steve McCausland, spokesman for the fire marshal's office, said in a statement Sunday night.
The body was transported to the state medical examiner's office in Augusta for an autopsy, McCausland said.
Portland
Car hits I-295 guardrail, flips onto Marginal Way
A Maine man was not seriously hurt but will face several charges after his speeding car hit a guardrail on Interstate 295 and flipped down onto Marginal Way in Portland, according to Maine State Police.
Trooper Joe Royle said witnesses reported spotting a silver Lexus being operated erratically in the northbound lanes at a high speed about 10:30 a.m. Saturday, weaving in and out of traffic, when it spun across the three lanes, hit the guardrail and flipped over the rail onto the street below.
The sedan landed on its tires near the U-Haul building on Marginal Way.
The man was taken to Maine Medical Center with minor lacerations.
He was charged with driving to endanger and will face other charges, Royle said.
His name is not being released at this time, Royle said. There were no passengers in the Lexus and no one else was hurt.
Westbrook
Building with residence, dental office hit by fire
The Westbrook Fire Department responded Sunday night to a fire inside a building with a dentist's office and residence in downtown Westbrook.
Dispatcher William Nelson said units were working to put out the fire at Nano Dentistry, 13 Pleasant St., between Main Street and William Clarke Drive. The fire was first reported between 8 and 8:30 p.m.
Nelson said there is at least one residential unit in the building, and that at least three residents had been displaced by the fire.
"They're being assisted by the Red Cross," he said about the residents, whose names were not available.
The fire prompted temporary street closures in the immediate area so crews could connect fire hoses to hydrants across the street, Nelson said.
Nelson said the cause of the fire was unknown as of about 9:30 p.m., and that he expected firefighters to be at the scene until well into the early morning hours on Monday.

Canadian driver loses control of tractor-trailer
A Canadian driver lost control of his tractor-trailer on a steep, downhill portion of a slippery Route 27 early Saturday, causing the truck to roll over into a deep ditch.
Jimmy Quirion, 38, of Frontenac, Quebec, was operating the 2019 Peterbilt, which sustained extensive damage to the tractor and trailer, according to Sgt. Nate Bean of the Franklin County Sheriff's Office.
Quirion, who was not injured in the accident, was hauling logs, according to Bean.
The area was experiencing freezing rain and the roads were extremely slippery at the time of the rollover, which was reported at 4 a.m.
Officers from U.S. Border and Customs Protection assisted in temporarily shutting down the road following the accident.
LEWISTON
Driver crashes pickup into trees and house
Police said a Lisbon Falls man was charged with drunken driving and leaving the scene after he crashed his truck into a house near Cherrywood Drive early Saturday.
Timothy McCrater, 48, was charged with operating under the influence, leaving the scene of a property-damage accident and refusal to submit to arrest, police Lt. David St. Pierre said.
He said McCrater's 2004 GMC pickup slammed into trees and a vehicle parked in the driveway of the home before crashing into the house around midnight. He then fled into the woods.
Police used a tracking dog to find McCrater along power lines about 1:30 a.m., St. Pierre said. McCrater was taken to a hospital for treatment of unspecified injuries, according to officials.

LePage now says he'll purchase home in Maine
Gov. Paul LePage says people are going to miss him when he's gone, and he's repeating his vow to run for a third term if he doesn't like the actions taken by his successor.
LePage told the Morning Sentinel he and his wife plan to spend the winter at their Florida home and return to Maine in the spring. He said they hope to buy a home in Aroostook County to be closer to grandchildren in New Brunswick.

Texto completo: HEBRON -- Nearly a year after she was diagnosed with lung cancer, Amy Richard said she is "hanging in there."
"I'm not as strong as I was. I've lost some weight," she said. "But my scans have been stable, so that's good news. And I'm getting into some advocacy work."
Richard, 42, is a wife, mother of two young children and a nurse who works with lung cancer patients. She was diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer, caused by a genetic mutation, last January.
A story about her plight and the support she received from the community appeared in the Sun Journal in March.
Since then, Richard has continued to use a new gene-targeting therapy she battled her health insurance company over. Physically, she's very tired, in a lot of pain, not sleeping well.
"Not a fun ride," Richard said. "I think a lot of it is just the exertion from breathing. It takes a lot out of me."
A nurse at Central Maine Cardiothoracic and Vascular Surgery in Lewiston, she's working part time. Her husband, Chris, has taken over a lot of household duties because she can't do it.
But Richard has participated in a public service announcement to raise awareness about radon, a naturally occurring radioactive gas that can cause lung cancer. She's started alternative therapies, such as acupuncture and reiki, and has changed her diet. Her condition is stable.
In the year since her diagnosis, friends, family and community members have continued to rally around her. After the Celebration of Courage Co-ed Hockey Tournament was held in her honor in March, two more fundraisers were held for her - a golf tournament and a softball tournament.
She's used the proceeds to pay for medical bills, alternative therapies not covered by insurance and a chiropractor for her back spasms.
Her co-workers adopt a family every Christmas. This year, they adopted hers, complete with gifts for her 7-year-old daughter and 3-year-old son.
"My co-workers are amazing," she said. "I swear, it was like a Hallmark Christmas movie."
It's been, she said, "overwhelming in a good way."
"I cannot believe all the support from everybody in the community," she said.
That support has gone beyond money, and she's grateful for that, too.
"I just want to say a huge thank-you to everyone who's sent me messages just to check in. ... Someone reaching out and saying, 'How are you doing? How are you really doing?' " she said. "Because I was in denial, I think, for a good many months about this. This fall it hit me that this is really happening. It's been hard. It's been kind of a rough fall. I think it would have been a lot tougher if I didn't have the support of everybody: family, friends, co-workers, strangers, people I don't even know."

She asked former Maine poet laureate Wesley McNair to write a poem for the occasion, a challenge that McNair, who lives in Mercer, accepted. McNair will deliver his poem "The Song for the Unsung" during the public celebration that begins at 6 p.m. Wednesday at the Augusta Civic Center. That's a big change from eight years ago, when Paul LePage removed poetry from the ceremony that formally installs the next governor to the highest office in the land of Longfellow. Poetry had been part of the gubernatorial inauguration for as long as anyone could remember, and LePage's decision to strip it from the ceremony was seen as a mean-spirited snub of Maine's literary traditions.
Mills is looking forward to hearing what McNair has come up with - and doesn't want to know anything about the poem in advance. "I haven't read it and don't want to read it. I will be as surprised as anybody, and I am sure it will be good. Wes is a wonderful poet and a wonderful friend," she said.
To honor Mills' request, McNair declined to discuss his poem in detail, but said he approached the assignment with caution and did not say yes right away. "You get these opportunities to write commissioned poems, but it's dangerous territory for a poet," said McNair, who was poet laureate from 2011 to 2016. "The true poems come from the inside out. You have to be inspired to write it. It doesn't come from some assignment."
But he's known Mills for many years and understands her vision and her passions. He accepted the assignment when he realized he was "able to lay claim to the material," he said. "I will deliver it at the event, and with pleasure. I've been enthusiastic about her for a long time."
The underground Portland press Littoral Books included two poems by Mills when it published an anthology of Maine poetry in 1975, "Balancing Act." Mills was a law student in Portland at the time, working toward a law degree that eventually would help her become Maine's attorney general, the role she has filled since 2013. When "Balancing Act 2" came out a few weeks ago, Mills showed up at the launch party at Space Gallery in Portland to talk about the importance of poetry in her life.
"I do still occasionally write poetry when I have time," she said in an interview, "when I feel like emptying my brain and putting words on paper, disconnected words that sometimes find their way together and create a poem."
Poetry is important to her because it helps her understand the world holistically and helps connect her senses. "We have eyes that can see only so far. We have ears that can hear only so far," she said. "Poetry connects the dots among things that are otherwise not connected, that we cannot see, that we cannot hear, that we cannot touch or smell or know, and it helps you understand the world and the universe and human nature."
McNair said Mills' embrace of poetry will make her a leader "worthy of our trust" because poets are trained to throw off preconceptions and use their writing as a way to search for a higher truth. Poets recognize that the things they do not know lead to knowledge and understanding, he said. Her desire to learn and her willingness to explore the truth, however uncomfortable or inconvenient, will give her an edge among politicians "who don't want to know beyond what they already know because it will threaten their argument," McNair said.
"To be a poet and a reader of poetry you have to be capable of intuitive insight, which is a power that not everybody has. The insight of intuition involves seeing something in relationship to other things. That's how poetry works. From those insights come vision, and that's what will make her different as a politician. She will think in a different way and in a way that I think is good for Maine," he said.
Mills and McNair are longtime friends through their mutual associations at the University of Maine at Farmington. Mills grew up in Farmington, and McNair is professor emeritus at the university. He's written nine books of poetry and won grants from the Guggenheim and Fulbright foundations and was recognized as one of America's finest living artists with a $50,000 United States Artists Fellowship.
Soon after taking office in 2011, LePage named McNair the state's poet laureate, and McNair adopted "Poetry for the People" as the theme of his term.
Mills called McNair "a wonderful friend" and said it was important to use the occasion of her inauguration to remind people of Maine's literary legacy of poets and other kinds of writers.
Maine natives Edna St. Vincent Millay and Edwin Arlington Robinson won four Pulitzer Prize awards in poetry between them, and Louise Bogan of Livermore Falls was the nation's fourth poet laureate in 1945. Current Maine resident Richard Blanco wrote and delivered the poem "One Today" at the second inauguration of President Obama in 2013. And Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, the rock-star poet of the Victorian era, was born in Portland in 1807.
All of that says nothing of the three Pulitzer winners living in Maine today - Elizabeth Strout, Richard Ford and Richard Russo - and the hundreds of others across Maine who write all kinds of books for all kinds of readers and for all kinds of reasons. "We've got some fine, talented people in the state of Maine who are writing novels, histories and poems," Mills said. "There's an incredible richness of literary people, and there has been for a long time."
Cathie Pelletier, a novelist from Allagash, said Mills has shown up at so many of her readings "she once blurted out from the back of the room the punch line to one of my jokes."
Mills supports writers by buying their books by the dozen, Pelletier said. "I'll say, 'Janet, you bought my book a dozen times.' She'll reply, 'It's a gift for so-and-so.' I see books around my house that Janet sent, especially poetry collections: 'Thought you'd like this one,' scrawled inside," Pelletier wrote in an email. "It's her way of supporting the poet who wrote the book."
Pelletier described Mills as a poet at heart, loyal to the written word "and to those of us who create it in the trenches." She also described her friend as indefatigable. "I wish there were a shorter word, but it takes six syllables to aptly describe her," Pelletier wrote.
In an email, Blanco wrote: "The role of an inaugural poet, as I came to understand and experience it, is to reflect the vision of what a new administration may mean to our lives; not with respect to policy or politics, but rather, from a humanitarian point of view. The inaugural poem is not meant to be a political or policy speech; like any good poem, an inaugural poem is meant to appeal to our emotions, connect us all to our shared humanity, and evoke a new conversation. But perhaps the most important lesson I learned, and would share with Wes McNair, is this: an inaugural poem isn't solely about the occasion, but equally about what the poet feels about the occasion. In other words, it's as much a personal poem as it is a public one."
Joshua Bodwell, executive director of the Maine Writers & Publishers Alliance, said LePage's snub eight years ago galvanized people and helped motivate McNair and his successor, the current poet laureate, Stuart Kestenbaum, to create platforms for people to access poems as part of their daily lives. Since then, poems by Maine poets have been printed in newspapers across Maine, read on the radio and shared on social media. Hotels make poetry available to guests in their rooms.
"LePage might not have lit the proverbial fire, but he likely stoked it," Bodwell said. "His dismissiveness, his unnecessary crassness, served as a catalyzing moment. Would Wes and Stu - and many others - have launched and sustained great poetry initiatives over the past eight years had LePage not been so rude about his inauguration? Yes, I suppose so. But I think LePage's behavior helped focus those efforts. If we weren't loud enough promoters of Maine poetry back in 2010, I hope we've done quite a bit of good to get things pointed in the right direction now."
Bodwell was "deeply moved" when Mills attended the book launch for "Balancing Act 2" at Space and stood on stage to speak about poetry.
"I'm paraphrasing her here, of course, but she talked about what poetry has meant to her over the years, about how through poetry, reading and writing, we might come to understand ourselves better, and in doing so, then come to understand others around us better, too," Bodwell said. "She suggested, with a bit of a wink, that more politicians should read poetry. What a thought, eh?"

Texto completo: POWNAL -- At his last post, in the Allagash Wilderness Waterway, Caribou native Chris Silsbee had a four-hour commute to work, left his family for nine days at a time to live in the woods and might see more deer than people on any given day.
Two years ago, deciding his family was ready for a change, they moved the farthest south they've ever lived, to Bradbury Mountain State Park.
"Depending on the time of year up on the Allagash, it could be days before I'd see somebody," said Silsbee, 41. "Being so close to a high-populated area down here, Bradbury is kind of nice because it's so close to everything, yet once you're here, you kind of feel like you are quite a ways away."
On Tuesday, New Year's Day, he'll lead his second First Day Hike as the park manager. It's a part of a national park program to get people out and active.
Nationwide, nearly 55,000 people participated last year, according to StateParks.org, logging 133,000 miles.
At Bradbury, they'll log just 2: 1 mile up to the summit via the Northern Loop Trail and 1 mile back down on the Terrace Trail.
It's free to the public and takes off at 10 a.m.
"I'll be telling about the ecosystem here, the animals we have living here, a lot of the park history," Silsbee said. "If we see animal tracks, we'll stop and look."
Growing up in Caribou, Silsbee said he always loved the outdoors. At the University of Maine at Presque Isle, he got involved with the outing club and outdoor rec program.
His first job with the state was as a college intern with the Maine Forest Service and he was sent out West to fight fires.
"It wasn't anything too drastic," Silsbee said. "It was a big fire danger year that year, there were many fires in many different states. I bounced around a lot: Washington, Idaho, Utah."
His first ranger position was as an assistant at Lily Bay State Park in Greenville for three years. From there, he spent six years in the Penobscot River Corridor and seven in the Allagash as what's called a back country ranger. Think lots of woods, few people and 11-hour working days.
Work was typically nine days on, four to five days off, and in the early part of his career, cellphone and Wi-Fi-free.
"You get up and you patrol your area, take care of your campsites, make sure you're around to help people when they get into trouble," he said. "At the end of the day you get back to your ranger cabin. I would spend my evenings fishing and just kind of going for a paddle in my kayak."
Silsbee, who is also manager of Mackworth Island State Park outside of Falmouth, said his family has settled in nicely to the house provided inside the park.
"It's a big house - I've got four kids, so we filled it," he said. "Early in my career I never thought I'd find myself this far south, but living here now for a couple years, I've come to enjoy it."

Texto completo: Jury selection will begin Jan. 7 in federal court in Portland for the trial of a Springvale resident who was the subject of an intense FBI manhunt in November.
Joshua Patrick Weldon, 26, was arrested by the FBI in Alfred on Aug. 13 on a charge of conspiracy to distribute fentanyl. The charge alleges that Weldon and others conspired to distribute 40 grams or more of a mixture or substance containing fentanyl between April and July 13 in York County.
Court documents reveal that three other suspects linked to the same case have also been charged and are awaiting trial.
Weldon had been held in federal custody on the drug charge until he was released by the U.S. District Court for the District of Maine on Oct. 23 on a $10,000 unsecured bond, provided he reside at a sober house and be subject to pretrial supervision.
According to the FBI, Weldon failed to fulfill the terms of his release from custody. He did not show up at a sober house on Oct. 24 as mandated and he skipped an appointment at the U.S. Probation Office on Oct. 25.
A warrant was issued for Weldon's arrest for allegedly violating the order setting forth the conditions of his release.
He continued to elude the FBI and police while on the run. On Nov. 6, Sanford police said they saw Weldon driving and tried to stop him, but he raced away at a high speed, left the vehicle and fled on foot. The FBI said that while a police dog was tracking Weldon, he got a ride to a Springvale apartment, where he smashed the glass of the front door after he was refused entry and then fled.
On Nov. 14, Harold H. Shaw, special agent in charge of the FBI Boston Division which includes all of Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Rhode Island, asked the public for help in determining Weldon's whereabouts and the FBI offered a reward of up to $5,000 for information leading to his capture. Shaw urged the public to be cautious if they spotted the fugitive and described Weldon as "armed and dangerous."
The FBI's Southern Maine Gang Task Force, the Sanford Police Department, Maine State Police and the York County Sheriff's Office were involved in the investigation.
After a number of possible reported sightings in Sanford and Rochester, New Hampshire, Weldon was taken into custody by police outside The Depot, a convenience store on Pleasant Street in Springvale, on Nov. 16.
U.S. District Magistrate Judge John H. Rich revoked Weldon's bail and rescheduled his trial on the drug charges to January. His original trial date had been set for December before he fled and became a fugitive.
If convicted on the drug charge, Weldon faces between five and 40 years in prison. He also will be subject to a further sentence for violating the terms of his release.

Medical pot tainted? In Maine, it isn't tested

Texto completo: Lack of quality assurance risks contamination; rule changes coming, but advocates warn against overregulation
For years, Sharon Corbett would consume a gram of highly concentrated cannabis oil every week hoping to ward off a return of her esophageal cancer.
The 68-year-old Lincolnville retiree believed that $25-a-gram oil was saving her life. But over the summer, when she started feeling sick, a friend urged her to get it tested. A private lab concluded the oil contained high levels of naphtha, a chemical solvent used as a paint thinner or lighter fluid that can contain cancer-causing substances and is illegal to use in marijuana extractions in Colorado and Massachusetts.
"One day, I've got my oncologist telling me, 'I don't know what you're doing, but whatever it is, keep doing it,' and I think everything's great," said Corbett. "Then I open an email from the lab telling me I've been taking a daily dose of paint thinner for years. Even my doctor doesn't know what that's done to me, but it can't be good."
In Maine, nobody is checking to see if the cannabis sold now is safe. Medical marijuana has been legal since 1999, with 50,000 certified patients purchasing $50 million of cannabis a year to treat conditions ranging from glaucoma to AIDS, yet none of it must be tested. Oregon, Washington and Colorado test their medical marijuana for contaminants like mold, residual solvents and bacteria. Maine forbids the use of high-risk pesticides but doesn't test for it.
The Maine Medical Association calls marijuana contamination "one of the most significant risks" facing the legal market. Threats can range from E. coli poisoning to deadly lung infections, but many of the risks cannot be accurately calculated because federally funded researchers are limited in their ability to study marijuana, much less the contamination risks posed by the many different ways that adults are legally using it in 33 U.S. states.
One marijuana testing lab says that Maine's medical marijuana is rife with contaminants of all kinds, ranging from high levels of residual solvents like naphtha or rubbing alcohol in concentrates, to mold and bacteria, to pesticides. According to Nick Des Lauriers, the business manager of ProVerde Laboratories in Portland, failing cannabis products are the norm in Maine.
"There are some bad people out there doing some pretty shady things to make a quick buck that could make people really sick," Des Lauriers said.
Falmouth doctor Dustin Sulak, a cannabis specialist, says with help, most patients can grow their own cannabis and even learn how to correctly create the proper concentrations and doses. He cautions patients about buying medical marijuana because of purity concerns, especially for the very young and very old consumers, Sulak said, as well as those who have seizures, chemical sensitivity or neurological illnesses.
"Nine years in, there is still not a single product in the marketplace that I can say with absolute certainty is quality-assured, for labeling of active ingredients or for freedom from contamination," said Sulak, whose medical practice treats or consults on more than 8,000 medical marijuana cases. "I'm sad to say there isn't a single product in the state that I can be certain meets my standards."
With the rollout of Maine's recreational market looming in 2019, however, the marijuana testing landscape is about to change.
Maine will require mandatory potency and safety tests for marijuana that will be sold to the 325,000 Mainers and 8.5 million tourists expected to participate in the new recreational market. The state Department of Administrative and Financial Services has hired BOTEC Analysis of Los Angeles to help it pick which tests will be done on which products, establish acceptable limits for marijuana contaminants, and determine what happens when products fail.
Currently, Maine has just one medical marijuana consumer safety law on the books: only minimum-risk pesticides, like cinnamon and peppermint oil, are allowed. But Maine doesn't release medical cannabis enforcement data, or even the number of times it inspects its eight dispensaries or 2,900 medical caregivers, so it is not clear if anyone breaks the pesticide law or if patients have complained about it. The state has denied repeated requests from the Portland Press Herald/Maine Sunday Telegram for this information.
The agency, which will oversee both adult-use and medical marijuana, wants to apply mandatory testing rules to all cannabis, including medical, said spokesman David Heidrich. It will try to do that through an administrative process, but if needed, DAFS will ask state lawmakers to adopt a medical marijuana consumer safety law, he said.
In the absence of mandated testing, medical marijuana consumers are on their own to assess the purity of their medicine.
Christine Chicoine followed a doctor's recommendation when deciding who would make oil for her now 16-year-old daughter, who has pain from a childhood bout of Henoch-Schönlein purpura, a disease that causes swelling of the small blood vessels. The 39-year-old Waldo County mother sought an oil with almost no THC, the intoxicating ingredient of cannabis. She wanted it extracted using food-grade alcohol to protect her daughter's immune-compromised system.
The doctor referred her to LoveGrown, a Farmington caregiving operation run by Erica and Jack Haywood that advertises medical-grade cannabis and hemp.
"It was organic this and organic that, we never do this and we always do that," Chicoine recalls. "Based on the way she talked, she is the last person I'd have ever expected to mess around with a child's medicine. I can't tell you how many times she preached to me about the evils of isopropyl alcohol. It's junk and it will make you sick, she said. Well, guess what was used to make my daughter's oil?"
Her daughter had been taking the oil for about a month when the itching started. Headaches and stomachaches followed. Chicoine sent the oil to a lab for testing, which showed rubbing alcohol was used to extract the oil. Her daughter stopped using the hemp oil and her symptoms faded. Instead, Chicoine treated her with a low-THC tincture made from her personal medical marijuana grow until she eventually found a new caregiver who tests every batch of hemp oil.
"I'm not a big government person, but I think anything for a kid, it ought to be tested," Chicoine said.
Robin Crawley was also a LoveGrown patient. The raw hemp oil extract the Vassalboro information technology specialist bought from Erica Haywood was a lot stronger than Chicoine's, as it hadn't been diluted. When she began to feel sick, she took the oil to a testing lab. It contained 17,620 parts per million of rubbing alcohol, or more than three times the Massachusetts legal limit, results show.
Crawley is angry, but she doesn't want to say anything that could prompt regulators to require unreasonable tests that could drive up prices or hurt the community.
"It was an ugly thing, all around, causing a big uproar, but I never stopped believing in the plant or the program," she said. "Now I ask a lot of questions and I test when I can."
Haywood blamed the problem on a third-party processor. LoveGrown had started to grow so much hemp that its board decided to farm out the extraction, like most Maine caregivers were doing at the time. Haywood instructed the extractor to use food-grade ethanol, but didn't test the oil she got back for contamination. The third-party processor, Wholesale International, said it warned Haywood the extraction had gone awry but that she sold it to patients anyway.
"No way should that stuff have been sold to patients," said Matt Fournier, one of Wholesale International's principals.
The dispute devolved into a he said/she said argument, with Haywood saying Fournier never told her the extraction had failed, while he claims he did.
In the aftermath, LoveGrown tested the product on its own, informed a third client who had bought the contaminated oil and offered the client refunds, according to Haywood. LoveGrown now always does its own extractions, in house, even if it takes longer to do it, Haywood said.
Despite the risks, the marijuana industry worries mandatory testing could slow down the rollout of the adult-use market and drive up the price of medical cannabis. Some caregivers question the accuracy of the results, claiming that different labs will come back with widely varying results from tests performed on the very same batch of cannabis products, depending on the kind of equipment the lab uses.
Maine doesn't have any state-licensed cannabis testing labs yet. State lawmakers passed a law requiring medical marijuana test labs to be state-licensed, but the law was never implemented by Gov. Paul LePage's administration. But DAFS is now working with the Colorado firm of Freedman & Koski to develop rules to start issuing state laboratory licenses soon. Independently accredited labs can operate without those rules in place now, however.
Currently, Maine has two independent cannabis labs: ProVerde Labs, which opened a new Portland lab in November, and Tested Labs in Kennebunk, which was started by Sulak, the Falmouth doctor, but sold to Nelson Analytical in 2017. Some Mainers use Massachusetts labs, but they take the risk of crossing state lines with a federally illegal drug. With just two Maine labs, however, customers can expect to wait two to four weeks for results unless they pay higher rush fees.
A full slate of tests -- potency, residual solvents, pesticides, heavy metals, fungus and bacteria -- costs $550. If mandatory testing is expanded into Maine's medical market, small-time caregivers who produce relatively small harvests could get priced out of the market and patients would likely see the price of their flower, salve, oil or edible go up as producers pass along at least some of the higher production costs.
At least two other labs have expressed interest in coming to Maine once the state begins licensing labs, which could help cut down on testing delays and prices.
Most of Maine's eight medical marijuana dispensaries have developed in-house labs to help fine-tune their manufacturing process and confirm both potency and consumer safety and use ProVerde and Nelson labs to independently confirm those results. Now that Maine allows wholesale medical cannabis sales, dispensary managers say they will use outside labs to run a full panel of purity tests on all third-party cannabis before selling it.
Those third-party cannabis tests have been surprising for Wellness Connection CEO Patricia Rosi, who runs four of Maine's eight dispensaries. About half of those who approach Wellness about wholesale opportunities balk when they find out Wellness is only interested if they can visit the grower's cultivation site. Of those that agree to a visit, only 29 percent can pass the outside testing screening, with most failures stemming from too much yeast or mold in the smokable marijuana.
Wellness has had its own contaminant trouble. In 2013, the state fined Wellness $18,000 for using pesticides at a time when state law prohibited the use of any pesticides in cannabis production. After the investigation, Wellness and other dispensaries successfully lobbied for a law allowing minimum-risk pesticides, like peppermint oil or cinnamon. Now, Wellness relies on integrated pest management to do the work of pesticides.
According to Rosi, the pesticide violation forced Wellness to become a leader in producing clean cannabis. Now the company is lobbying Maine to implement mandatory testing for all medical marijuana, both as a protection for patients as well as a market equalizer, she said. The law will force caregivers, who are the dispensaries' top rivals for medical marijuana patients, to meet the same quality standards and pay the same testing costs as dispensaries do, she said.
Sulak launched Tested Labs in 2013 to help him calculate the potency of the cannabis that his patients were buying from caregivers and dispensaries. Without it, he couldn't establish safe, effective dosage levels. Patient after patient would come into his office with an unmarked bottle of cannabis oil and ask him how much they should take. Without testing, he wouldn't even know what was inside, much less how much of it they should take.
But Sulak does not think the answer to the substandard quality lies in mandatory testing. That would force caregivers out of business and undermine the diversity of the Maine market, which is its greatest strength, Sulak said. The state's patchwork network of 3,000 caregivers and eight dispensaries allows for thousands of different cannabis products made from a dizzying array of plant strains, he said. Curb that and patients will suffer.
"Put it in the hands of the consumer and let them decide, just like they do at the grocery store," Sulak said. "Do they buy organic food or not?"
Data from regional hospital intakes and poison control records indicate that Maine consumers haven't been getting sick from contaminated marijuana. The Northern New England Poison Control Center received fewer than 15 calls about contaminated cannabis over the last three years, and none of those led to hospitalization, according to director Karen Simone. But it's too early to say what long-term exposure to marijuana contaminants will do, she warned.
In the last year, ProVerde has seen potency testing in Maine steadily grow, but contaminant testing only spikes when a shocked patient like Crawley posts failing test results on Facebook, Des Lauriers said. The lab usually keeps its mouth shut when it comes to test findings, especially since Maine does not have any rules, but occasionally it comes across something so shocking, like Corbett's results, that it will send out a warning email to customers.
Corbett ended up with a naphtha-contaminated oil because of price. Some caregivers had charged her as much as $100 a gram, but the caregiver who used the naphtha to make the oil only charged her $20. She believed that was because she got a price break as a full-time patient, usually bought in bulk at harvest time when the price of marijuana drops, and bought from somebody who worked out of his home, who didn't have to factor in the overhead costs of running a store.
According to ProVerde, which tested Corbett's oil, the product contained 1,339 parts per million of naphtha-related chemicals. Because marijuana is still illegal on the federal level, national food and drug regulators won't weigh in on naphtha marijuana extractions. And there are no clinical medical trials showing the impact of a long-term exposure to its use in cannabis oil, but regulators warn that naphtha levels of 1,000 parts per million are immediately dangerous to life and health.
Corbett isn't angry with her caregiver, who was just following an online recipe, and refused to name him. She still buys smokable cannabis from him.
Corbett doesn't know if the depression and respiratory problems she experienced while using the naphtha-made oil were related to the residual solvent, or if they were linked to her cancer, but they have gotten better since she stopped using the contaminated extract. The lack of reliable medical research on cannabis, or its contaminants, leaves her doctors unable to predict how long-term daily exposure to naphtha may impact Corbett's future health.
Doctors also can't say what role cannabis played in Corbett's recovery from cancer. Without clinical trials in thousands of human subjects, the National Institute on Drug Abuse says the federal government can't properly assess the benefits and risks of medical marijuana, but it notes the cannabis plant may contain chemicals that help treat a range of illnesses and symptoms. Research in mice shows marijuana extracts may help kill certain cancer cells and reduce the size of others.
Corbett considered forgoing the oil altogether, but her oncologist's warning -- "nobody survives esophageal cancer, even with surgery. ... I can't explain why you're still here" -- drove her back out into the medical marijuana marketplace looking for the perfect mix of purity and affordability. What she found was New World Organics, a caregiver storefront in Belfast, where shopkeeper Justin Olsen gives her a cannabis oil made with food-grade alcohol every month for free.
"The neediest patients are oftentimes the ones least able to afford treatment," said Olsen. "I believe in the power of healing through cannabis."

Poetry back in inaugural ceremony

Texto completo: Janet Mills is a published poet and a vocal advocate for Maine's literary community, so it's not surprising the state's next governor is returning poetry to a prominent place in the inauguration ceremonies on Wednesday.
She asked former Maine poet laureate Wesley McNair to write a poem for the occasion, a challenge that McNair, who lives in Mercer, accepted. McNair will deliver his poem, "The Song for the Unsung," during the public celebration that begins at 6 p.m. Wednesday at the Augusta Civic Center. That's a big change from eight years ago, when Paul LePage removed poetry from the ceremony that formally installs the next governor to the highest office in the land of Longfellow. Poetry had been part of the gubernatorial inauguration for as long as anyone could remember, and LePage's decision to strip it from the ceremony was seen as a mean-spirited snub of Maine's literary traditions.
Mills is looking forward to hearing what McNair has come up with -- and doesn't want to know anything about the poem in advance. "I haven't read it and don't want to read it. I will be as surprised as anybody, and I am sure it will be good. Wes is a wonderful poet and a wonderful friend," she said.
To honor Mills' request, McNair declined to discuss his poem in detail, but said he approached the assignment with caution and did not say yes right away. "You get these opportunities to write commissioned poems, but it's dangerous territory for a poet," said McNair, who was poet laureate from 2011 to 2016. "The true poems come from the inside out. You have to be inspired to write it. It doesn't come from some assignment."
But he's known Mills for many years and understands her vision and her passions. He accepted the assignment when he realized he was "able to lay claim to the material," he said. "I will deliver it at the event, and with pleasure. I've been enthusiastic about her for a long time."
The underground Portland press Littoral Books included two poems by Mills when it published an anthology of Maine poetry in 1975, "Balancing Act." Mills was a law student in Portland at the time, working toward a law degree that eventually would help her become Maine's attorney general, the role she has filled since 2013. When "Balancing Act 2" came out a few weeks ago, Mills showed up at the launch party at Space Gallery in Portland to talk about the importance of poetry in her life.
"I do still occasionally write poetry when I have time," she said in an interview, "when I feel like emptying my brain and putting words on paper, disconnected words that sometimes find their way together and create a poem."
Poetry is important to her because it helps her understand the world holistically and helps connect her senses. "We have eyes that can see only so far. We have ears that can hear only so far," she said. "Poetry connects the dots among things that are otherwise not connected, that we cannot see, that we cannot hear, that we cannot touch or smell or know, and it helps you understand the world and the universe and human nature."
McNair said Mills' embrace of poetry will make her a leader "worthy of our trust" because poets are trained to throw off preconceptions and use their writing as a way to search for a higher truth. Poets recognize that the things they do not know lead to knowledge and understanding, he said. Her desire to learn and her willingness to explore the truth, however uncomfortable or inconvenient, will give her an edge among politicians "who don't want to know beyond what they already know because it will threaten their argument," McNair said.
"To be a poet and a reader of poetry you have to be capable of intuitive insight, which is a power that not everybody has. The insight of intuition involves seeing something in relationship to other things. That's how poetry works. From those insights come vision, and that's what will make her different as a politician. She will think in a different way and in a way that I think is good for Maine," he said.
Mills and McNair are longtime friends through their mutual associations at the University of Maine at Farmington. Mills grew up in Farmington, and McNair is professor emeritus at the university. He's written nine books of poetry and won grants from the Guggenheim and Fulbright foundations and was recognized as one of America's finest living artists with a $50,000 United States Artists Fellowship.
Soon after taking office in 2011, LePage named McNair the state's poet laureate, and McNair adopted "Poetry for the People" as the theme of his term.
Mills called McNair "a wonderful friend" and said it was important to use the occasion of her inauguration to remind people of Maine's literary legacy of poets and other kinds of writers.
Maine natives Edna St. Vincent Millay and Edwin Arlington Robinson won four Pulitzer Prize awards in poetry between them, and Louise Bogan of Livermore Falls was the nation's fourth poet laureate in 1945. Current Maine resident Richard Blanco wrote and delivered the poem "One Today" at the second inauguration of President Barack Obama in 2013. And Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, the rock-star poet of the Victorian era, was born in Portland in 1807.
All of that says nothing of the three Pulitzer winners living in Maine today -- Elizabeth Strout, Richard Ford and Richard Russo -- and the hundreds of others across Maine who write all kinds of books for all kinds of readers and for all kinds of reasons. "We've got some fine, talented people in the state of Maine who are writing novels, histories and poems," Mills said. "There's an incredible richness of literary people, and there has been for a long time."
Cathie Pelletier, a novelist from Allagash, said Mills has shown up at so many of her readings "she once blurted out from the back of the room the punch line to one of my jokes."
Mills supports writers by buying their books by the dozen, Pelletier said. "I'll say, 'Janet, you bought my book a dozen times.' She'll reply, 'It's a gift for so-and-so.' I see books around my house that Janet sent, especially poetry collections: 'Thought you'd like this one,' scrawled inside," Pelletier wrote in an email. "It's her way of supporting the poet who wrote the book."
Pelletier described Mills as a poet at heart, loyal to the written word "and to those of us who create it in the trenches." She also described her friend as indefatigable. "I wish there were a shorter word, but it takes six syllables to aptly describe her," Pelletier wrote.
In an email, Blanco wrote: "The role of an inaugural poet, as I came to understand and experience it, is to reflect the vision of what a new administration may mean to our lives; not with respect to policy or politics, but rather, from a humanitarian point of view. The inaugural poem is not meant to be a political or policy speech; like any good poem, an inaugural poem is meant to appeal to our emotions, connect us all to our shared humanity, and evoke a new conversation. But perhaps the most important lesson I learned, and would share with Wes McNair, is this: an inaugural poem isn't solely about the occasion, but equally about what the poet feels about the occasion. In other words, it's as much a personal poem as it is a public one."
Joshua Bodwell, executive director of the Maine Writers & Publishers Alliance, said LePage's snub eight years ago galvanized people and helped motivate McNair and his successor, the current poet laureate, Stuart Kestenbaum, to create platforms for people to access poems as part of their daily lives. Since then, poems by Maine poets have been printed in newspapers across Maine, read on the radio and shared on social media. Hotels make poetry available to guests in their rooms.
"LePage might not have lit the proverbial fire, but he likely stoked it," Bodwell said. "His dismissiveness, his unnecessary crassness, served as a catalyzing moment. Would Wes and Stu -- and many others -- have launched and sustained great poetry initiatives over the past eight years had LePage not been so rude about his inauguration? Yes, I suppose so. But I think LePage's behavior helped focus those efforts. If we weren't loud enough promoters of Maine poetry back in 2010, I hope we've done quite a bit of good to get things pointed in the right direction now."
Bodwell was "deeply moved" when Mills attended the book launch for "Balancing Act 2" at Space and stood on stage to speak about poetry.
"I'm paraphrasing her here, of course, but she talked about what poetry has meant to her over the years, about how through poetry, reading and writing, we might come to understand ourselves better, and in doing so, then come to understand others around us better, too," Bodwell said. "She suggested, with a bit of a wink, that more politicians should read poetry. What a thought, eh?"

Longtime DA ends her tenure

Texto completo: A group of burglars was plaguing well-to-do homes up and down the Maine coast, stealing silver candlesticks and other heirlooms.
Two of the suspects had been arrested once before and fled the state after posting tens of thousands of dollars for bail. So when they got caught again, the new district attorney in Cumberland County fought for them to remain in custody and persuaded a judge to give them six years in prison for what could have been treated as a petty crime.
When a leader of the group visited her office and tried to cut a deal on restitution, Stephanie Anderson brushed him off.
"We wanted this criminal organization to cease and desist and to consider Maine to be an extremely hostile working environment," Anderson said. "And they have not been back."
It was 1992, and the case hit Anderson's desk during her first term as district attorney, an office she would hold for 28 years overseeing what she estimates to be half a million cases. She would take on cases involving rape, child sex abuse, attempted murder and police misconduct, but she looks back on that burglary case as one of the most important.
It set a tone that Anderson would carry through her tenure in office as a forceful prosecutor who would hold her ground. That career comes to an end Tuesday, when Anderson hands over the reins to a successor she endorsed for the job.
Anderson, who is 66 and lives in Cape Elizabeth, decided not to seek re-election this year after winning seven times in a row, usually without any opposition.
Attorneys who have worked for and with her for nearly three decades described her as a tough lawyer who ushered the state's busiest prosecutorial district into the 21st century. She started the state's first drug court and witnessed criminal justice become more complex with the advent of technology such as police body cameras and social media. She has been the county's top prosecutor as crime decreased but the incarcerated population increased both nationally and in Maine.
"She's been around a long time, but with that has been cutting-edge work," said Michael Sauschuck, a former Portland police chief who was nominated Friday to lead the Maine Department of Public Safety.
Anderson grew up in Eliot, the daughter of a Navy chief petty officer and a waitress. As a young girl in a Catholic family, she first wanted to be a nun and then a ballerina. A strong religious faith would stay with her, but she decided at a young age that she would become an attorney when she read about Clarence Darrow, a famous labor and criminal defense attorney.
She earned a bachelor's degree from the University of Maine in Orono in 1974 and a law degree from the University of Maine School of Law in 1980. She had interned in the Cumberland County District Attorney's Office, but drove to New York City the day after graduating law school and went to work in the district attorney's office in Brooklyn. She worked there for five years, eventually becoming a senior trial attorney in the homicide bureau.
Anderson remembered the head of that office bristling at the idea of a female attorney joining his staff. He told each of his prosecutors to give her one of their cases, saddling her with the files no one wanted. She spent her first day in that office cramming for a trial and peppering the medical examiner with questions about the autopsy report.
"The attorney had told the bureau chief, there's no way she can win this," she said. "I did."
Anderson returned to Maine in 1985 and started her own criminal and civil practice. Other lawyers remembered that her trial experience from Brooklyn gave her an edge in the courtroom.
"She had a reputation as a pretty fearless trial lawyer," defense attorney Tom Hallett said. "Portland is actually a town with a lot of lawyers, and to stand out at all in that crowd is quite difficult, particularly as a young attorney. She did stand out."
A few years later, 37-year-old Anderson decided to go back into prosecuting crimes and launched a run for district attorney as a Republican, promising that she would bring her New York experience to bear, improve efficiency and speed up the prosecution of cases.
Anderson's straight-talking style was obvious from the start of the campaign in 1990. She easily defeated a younger Democratic opponent, David Perkins, once telling voters: "We have different experience. I have it, and David does not have it."
On her first day, she found a framed photograph on her new desk in the courthouse. It was a black-and-white picture from the newspaper of the moment she heard the election results -- her head thrown back in celebration and surprise. She won re-election six times -- unopposed in the general every time except in 1998 -- and today she is the lone Republican in an elected office in Cumberland County. That photo was still in her office this month as she spoke about her career.
Anderson quickly streamlined operations, according to officials who praised her at the time as an effective leader who could be both intimidating and charming.
During her tenure, Anderson personally handled several landmark trials.
She prosecuted Warren Cole, a prominent restaurant owner from Gray who was a serial child molester. His crimes were overlooked by law enforcement for years until two victims approached Anderson.
Anderson negotiated an unusual plea agreement in 1992 under which Cole told her all the names of the many boys he had abused and paid $100,000 toward a trust fund for those victims. Later, lawyers said that case made prosecutors more likely to take a child sex abuse case to a jury with the testimony of only one witness.
A decade later, Anderson successfully prosecuted a high-profile rape case involving teenagers at a party in New Gloucester.
The 14-year-old victim in that case had come forward publicly, bringing national interest to the trial. Newspaper clippings from that time described both Anderson and jurors wiping away tears as she made her closing argument and praised the girl for her bravery.
"I give Stephanie Anderson very high grades as a trial attorney," said William Childs, a defense attorney who represented the defendant, Benjamin Cormier. "A very worthy adversary in the courtroom."
In 2008, Anderson prosecuted Robert LaPointe, who ultimately spent time in prison for his role in a fatal boat accident on Long Lake in Harrison.
She won an infamous 2010 trial against Linda Dolloff, a Standish woman who tried to kill her husband and cover up the crime.
She handled a 2013 case against a Falmouth couple whose home was the site of a teenage drinking party. When the jury was deadlocked, the parties negotiated a deal that involved restitution and community service.
The Maine Judicial Branch does not track conviction rates. A fraction of the 10,000 cases that move through the district attorney's office in a given year go to trial. Many of the others result in plea deals, often involving guilty pleas for reduced charges.
Anderson oversees a staff of more than 50 people. That includes 20 attorneys, which Anderson believes is more than double the number when she started in 1991.
"She let you handle your cases the way you thought they should be handled," said Meg Elam, who worked in the Cumberland County District Attorney's Office for nearly three decades before she left for the Maine Attorney General's Office in 2015. "That was a gift to all of us that worked with her, that she trusted our judgment."
Anderson also clashed at times with other leaders in law enforcement, occasionally giving public glimpses of her ability to talk tough and push back.
In 1993, Portland's outspoken police chief, Michael Chitwood, held a news conference with leaders of the Maine NAACP criticizing Anderson for not aggressively pursuing crimes against minorities. Anderson angrily responded with her own press briefing detailing her office's actions on several cases.
"If Chief Chitwood spent as much time acquainting himself with the facts as he does holding press conferences, there would be a lot more peace in Cumberland County," she told news reporters.
She opposed Mark Dion's bid for re-election as Cumberland County sheriff in 2002, saying he lacked character. Dion, a Democrat, won the second term anyway.
"She definitely was a critic, there was no question about that," Dion said. "But it kind of makes you smile, a little bit of smirk, because that's her. That's just how she approaches it." And, he said, it was never personal.
After the election, Anderson called Dion and told him that she wanted to work together with him for the sake of the county, he said. Anderson's style of direct, no-nonsense communication could be off-putting, but came from a place of genuine belief in her positions, Dion said.
"She never seemed to me to be someone who worried about political wind," he said. "She was aware of it, but I think she had integrity in her decision-making."
The current sheriff, Kevin Joyce, credited her with making the criminal justice system more efficient over time, implementing ideas like a unified criminal docket and a bad-check enforcement program.
Sauschuck, who was the Portland police chief from 2012 until earlier this year, praised her open-door policy for officers who disagreed with her charging decisions or who had questions about a case.
Longtime defense attorneys described her as pragmatic and fair, tough but willing to negotiate.
Hallett spoke highly of Anderson and said she will be missed, but also pointed to a recent case as an example of how they disagreed over the years.
He represented a Black Lives Matter protester who was arrested in 2016 after taking part in a demonstration that blocked Commercial Street in Portland to protest police shootings of black men nationwide. When an attempt at a restorative justice meeting failed, the parties traded blame.
"I think as time went on, she became more closed-minded," Hallett said. "That's what I thought I saw in the Black Lives Matter case. I think being a prosecutor for a really long time is hard. Everything becomes a little more black and white. Defense lawyers, we live in a world of gray."
In recent years, Anderson has opposed some new ideas that are being tested in other states, such as eliminating a cash bail system that critics say forces poor people to languish in jail while others do not. But she is also described as an innovator, in particular for her decision to bring drug court to Maine in 1998.
The first drug court started in Florida in 1989. The specialized programs focus on cases that involve alcohol or drug dependency and provide flexibility and support, such as treatment and monitoring.
During her second term, Anderson secured more than $300,000 in federal grant money to start a similar program in Cumberland County. Defense attorney Neale Duffett served on the planning committee for what was called Project Exodus, which Anderson named in a nod to the Old Testament.
"It was well received," Duffett said. "Judges liked it, defense lawyers liked it and prosecutors liked it."
Adult drug treatment courts now operate in five counties in Maine, and the state has created similar court programs for child protective cases and other dockets. The total budget for drug treatment courts in Maine is $2.2 million during this fiscal year, according to a spokeswoman from the Maine Department of Health and Human Services.
But Anderson has long bemoaned a lack of resources allocated to the program, and she even called for its end five years ago during a dispute over the enforcement of probation violations. She argued that the program wouldn't work without a real threat of incarceration.
"If it can't be done right, it shouldn't be done at all," Anderson told the Press Herald in 2013.
Gov. Paul LePage ultimately intervened to stop the drug court from fizzling out. Since then, a probation officer has been dedicated to the county's drug court. Still, Anderson said she has become less convinced over the years that every person who is addicted to drugs is interested in quitting them.
"Yes, we need more treatment," Anderson said. "But ... I question, frankly, how many people want to live a life free from the bondage of addiction."
Kristine Hanly, the defense attorney liaison for all drug court participants, credited Anderson with starting the drug court and fighting for resources.
Hanly also said the court has evolved in recent years with new research on addiction and new treatments, even if the criminal justice system in Maine and across the country still struggles to shake the idea that relapse is a failure rather than a common occurrence on the path to recovery.
"The science just doesn't support that," she said.
Anderson will soon begin a new role as the executive director of the Maine Prosecutors Association.
Meanwhile, her old job will be taken over by the man she endorsed for it, Assistant District Attorney Jonathan Sahrbeck.
An unenrolled candidate, Sahrbeck won by default when the two other candidates in the general election dropped out. Republican Randall Bates withdrew from the race in September, saying the time wasn't right for him. Democrat Jon Gale dropped out just days before the November election because of allegations of sexual misconduct.
Sahrbeck has said he wants to make the role of district attorney more visible in the community, but will continue many of his predecessor's policies once he takes office in January.

Ski season in full swing

Texto completo: The Nordic ski season is well under way at the Quarry Road Trails, where colder-than-normal temperatures in early November allowed for a jump start on the snowmaking season and the earliest opening day ever.
The trails, part of a more than 200-acre facility owned by the city of Waterville, offer over 13 kilometers of groomed cross-country ski trails, including about 3 kilometers with the capability for snowmaking.
"Natural snow hasn't really materialized the way anyone would like, but we've been able to make snow and have a really good base 2.5 kilometer loop," said Dave MacLeay, president of the board of Friends of Quarry Road, a non-profit group that supports the city's operations at the trails.
"It's been pulling a lot of folks from around the state, especially the southern part, who are looking at Quarry Road as a place they can go and get on snow, whether it's the high school or college ski teams or just folks who want to get out. It's a nice resource to have and we're fortunate we have snowmaking to provide that experience for folks."
Volunteers assist the city's Parks and Recreation Department with snowmaking and also staff the welcome center at the Quarry Road Trails.
Snowmaking is often done at night, especially early in the season, to capitalize on colder temperatures and avoid disrupting skiers.
The 2017-2018 winter season saw 521 season passes sold, about 50 percent to Waterville residents, and 924 day tickets sold. MacLeay said this year's sales are on track for higher numbers.
Friends of Quarry Road also runs the Central Maine Ski Club after-school ski program, which is in session starting in January and has over 120 children -- the most the program has seen to date -- signed up, MacLeay said.
"We're excited it's grown year over year," he said. "It's nice to see that effort and investment start to take root."

Texto completo: RUMFORD -- Ski patrol apprentice Maia Belskis, 17, of Rumford, finds it rewarding to know she can help if someone gets hurt skiing.
The Mountain Valley High School junior is in her third year participating in Black Mountain of Maine's Ski Patrol Apprenticeship program. It gives Mountain Valley students the opportunity to learn about the ski industry -- from on-hill medical training and rescue evacuation to the logistics of running equipment and the economics of the business.
Belskis also volunteers for MedCare ambulance service. These experiences are giving her training to enter a medical field; she hopes to become a nurse anesthetist. "Everything that goes into this I have a passion for," she said.
Students who participate in the program must have a letter of recommendation and be in good standing as a student. They must also be experienced skiers.
"You need to be able to get to a scene quickly," said Belskis, who learned to ski at Black Mountain when she was 6.
The nonprofit ski area has youth in mind with most of its offerings, including ski camps, lessons and free passes for children in grades kindergarten to second.
Black Mountain opened for the season Dec. 26, said Amanda Carey, who was selling lift tickets Saturday with her mother, Kathy Carey.
It will offer two 12-week race camps for children ages 7 to 18. Those new to skiing can learn by participating in Kinder Club, for ages 3 to 6, or Snow Kids, ages 7 to 14, which last six weeks. Individual lessons are also available.
The mountain has 5 kilometers of Nordic trails open. It will offer tubing in January once more snow can be made, according to Kathy Carey. Eleven trails are open to downhill skiing and snowboarding, she said.
Skiers and snowboarders can look forward to Free Ski nights when local businesses sponsor lift passes. These are usually from 4 to 9 p.m. Thursdays. Dates will be announced on the ski area's website, skiblackmountain.org.
To accommodate those on holiday break, the ski area is open Friday to Tuesday from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Beginning Friday, Jan. 11, the regular hours will be Fridays and Saturdays, from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., and Sundays from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Lift passes are $40 for Rumford residents and $45 for nonresidents.

Arrest Trump for child abuse

Texto completo: Donald Trump admits that his administration is taking children away from their refugee parents as his way of punishing them and as a warning sign to parents not to dare to attempt immigration.
Once again, he has acted without considering the consequences. He has shown no concern about the devastating impact he has had on refugee children and their families. Rather, he's acted as if these children don't exist. His focus is on his wall and keeping the promise he made to his wall supporters rather than the thousands of children who've been torn from their parents.
Agents have reportedly lied about where the children will go and when they will see their parents or family members. The children don't know who they can trust and may not understand English. They are locked into facilities not suited for children and often with staff not trained to care for them or administer needed medical care.
Two children have now died in custody, and many more risk malnutrition, dehydration and possible physical and sexual abuse. Those who survive will likely have post-traumatic stress disorder for years to come and, given their experiences, they may have attachment disorders and difficulty trusting people as well.
Child abuse is a reportable crime, and Trump should be charged, tried and punished for it. He is not above the law, even though he may think he is.

Blame midterm results for stock market drop
In October, the Dow Jones industrial average reached a record high, nearing 27,000. As I write this letter, the Dow is down to 22,787, a decrease of 15.6 percent.
What are the reasons for this staggering market decline? Many ideas have been advanced by market analysts, by political leaders and by the media. These are some of the causes expressed by the media:
n
Global economic decline: Some of the big hitters in the global market, such as China and several of the European countries, have experienced economic downturns.
n
Federal Reserve interest rate increases: During this year, there have been four increases in the Federal Reserve rate, each being one quarter of 1 percent.
n
Historical last-quarter decline: It is not unusual for the stock market to decline in the months of October, November and December.
n
Signs of a slowing U.S. economy: While there continue to be positive economic indicators, such as good company earnings rates and low unemployment, there seems to be a growing concern that the boom market can't go on forever.
The media seldom talk about what I believe to be a big contributor to the market decline: that is, the midterm elections. When it became apparent during the summer months that Democrats would retake the House of Representatives, the market began its precipitous drop. Within two days of the election, the market continued its nosedive.
What is it that Democrats do that causes market downturns? For one, business is not their friend; the party often increases taxes, and they find various ways to regulate business and other activity, which usually end up adding to a company's expenses.
The media need to tell the whole story.

Exodus from Cabinet merits our attention
What in heaven's sake is going on in Washington, D.C.? The president's Cabinet is dropping like November leaves.
First was the State Department (Rex Tillerson is boneheaded) and then the Justice Department (they know nothing). The interior secretary is leaving, and another chief of staff has left (that's no surprise). In the Department of Defense, the last of the president's band of "my generals" is abandoning ship.
Now that his friends Kim Jong Un and Vladimir Putin are beginning to rattle their nuclear bells, maybe someone should be listening.
When will the president be moving his desk from the Oval Office over to his satellite office - the Pentagon?
Oh, yes, when I see Donald Trump standing on that hallowed ground at the veterans cemetery, it makes my stomach want to empty.

LePage, Poliquin, Trump seem to attract lawsuits
It was no surprise to me to notice the Portland Press Herald's lead front-page story Dec. 19 and no surprise, again, to see the top story on the front of the Local & State section the same day.
Both stories discussed lawsuits - one involving Bruce Poliquin (Page A1) and the other involving Gov. LePage (Page B1). Absent from the headlines in the paper that day was President Trump, who, before taking office, had been involved in more than 3,000 lawsuits.
I consider the legal system my friend; however, I'm grateful not to be in frequent need of it. In fact, the Bible, in Luke 12:57, talks about the good in settling differences between people without involving court action.
What is the thread of personality that would endear Bruce Poliquin, Paul LePage and Donald Trump to the legal system? Do they share an ability to avoid negotiation or compromise? Is it "My way or the highway"? Are we looking at arrogance and stubbornness - and maybe the inability to listen?
I, for one, will be delighted to say "goodbye" to all three of these men.

LePage, his pension welcome to stay away
In a Dec. 25 letter to the editor, Bill Barker of Westbrook complained that our dearly soon-to-be-departed governor, Paul LePage, is taking his pension money out of state.
What's the problem? Given the harm he has done to Maine, especially to the less fortunate among us, I think we should build a wall to make sure he doesn't come back.

Texto completo: Wesley McNair to deliver poem, reviving tradition dropped by LePage
Janet Mills is a published poet and a vocal advocate for Maine's literary community, so it's not surprising the state's next governor is returning poetry to a prominent place in the inauguration ceremonies on Wednesday.
She asked former Maine poet laureate Wesley McNair to write a poem for the occasion, a challenge that McNair, who lives in Mercer, accepted. McNair will deliver his poem, "The Song for the Unsung," during the public celebration that begins at 6 p.m. Wednesday at the Augusta Civic Center. That's a big change from eight years ago, when Paul LePage removed poetry from the ceremony that formally installs the next governor to the highest office in the land of Longfellow. Poetry had been part of the gubernatorial inauguration for as long as anyone could remember, and LePage's decision to strip it from the ceremony was seen as a mean-spirited snub of Maine's literary traditions.
Mills is looking forward to hearing what McNair has come up with -- and doesn't want to know anything about the poem in advance. "I haven't read it and don't want to read it. I will be as surprised as anybody, and I am sure it will be good. Wes is a wonderful poet and a wonderful friend," she said.
To honor Mills' request, McNair declined to discuss his poem in detail, but said he approached the assignment with caution and did not say yes right away. "You get these opportunities to write commissioned poems, but it's dangerous territory for a poet," said McNair, who was poet laureate from 2011 to 2016. "The true poems come from the inside out. You have to be inspired to write it. It doesn't come from some assignment."
But he's known Mills for many years and understands her vision and her passions. He accepted the assignment when he realized he was "able to lay claim to the material," he said. "I will deliver it at the event, and with pleasure. I've been enthusiastic about her for a long time."
The underground Portland press Littoral Books included two poems by Mills when it published an anthology of Maine poetry in 1975, "Balancing Act." Mills was a law student in Portland at the time, working toward a law degree that eventually would help her become Maine's attorney general, the role she has filled since 2013. When "Balancing Act 2" came out a few weeks ago, Mills showed up at the launch party at Space Gallery in Portland to talk about the importance of poetry in her life.
"I do still occasionally write poetry when I have time," she said in an interview, "when I feel like emptying my brain and putting words on paper, disconnected words that sometimes find their way together and create a poem."
Poetry is important to her because it helps her understand the world holistically and helps connect her senses. "We have eyes that can see only so far. We have ears that can hear only so far," she said. "Poetry connects the dots among things that are otherwise not connected, that we cannot see, that we cannot hear, that we cannot touch or smell or know, and it helps you understand the world and the universe and human nature."
McNair said Mills' embrace of poetry will make her a leader "worthy of our trust" because poets are trained to throw off preconceptions and use their writing as a way to search for a higher truth. Poets recognize that the things they do not know lead to knowledge and understanding, he said. Her desire to learn and her willingness to explore the truth, however uncomfortable or inconvenient, will give her an edge among politicians "who don't want to know beyond what they already know because it will threaten their argument," McNair said.
"To be a poet and a reader of poetry you have to be capable of intuitive insight, which is a power that not everybody has. The insight of intuition involves seeing something in relationship to other things. That's how poetry works. From those insights come vision, and that's what will make her different as a politician. She will think in a different way and in a way that I think is good for Maine," he said.
Mills and McNair are longtime friends through their mutual associations at the University of Maine at Farmington. Mills grew up in Farmington, and McNair is professor emeritus at the university. He's written nine books of poetry and won grants from the Guggenheim and Fulbright foundations and was recognized as one of America's finest living artists with a $50,000 United States Artists Fellowship.
Soon after taking office in 2011, LePage named McNair the state's poet laureate, and McNair adopted "Poetry for the People" as the theme of his term.
Mills called McNair "a wonderful friend" and said it was important to use the occasion of her inauguration to remind people of Maine's literary legacy of poets and other kinds of writers.
Maine natives Edna St. Vincent Millay and Edwin Arlington Robinson won four Pulitzer Prize awards in poetry between them, and Louise Bogan of Livermore Falls was the nation's fourth poet laureate in 1945. Current Maine resident Richard Blanco wrote and delivered the poem "One Today" at the second inauguration of President Barack Obama in 2013. And Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, the rock-star poet of the Victorian era, was born in Portland in 1807.
All of that says nothing of the three Pulitzer winners living in Maine today -- Elizabeth Strout, Richard Ford and Richard Russo -- and the hundreds of others across Maine who write all kinds of books for all kinds of readers and for all kinds of reasons. "We've got some fine, talented people in the state of Maine who are writing novels, histories and poems," Mills said. "There's an incredible richness of literary people, and there has been for a long time."
Cathie Pelletier, a novelist from Allagash, said Mills has shown up at so many of her readings "she once blurted out from the back of the room the punch line to one of my jokes."
Mills supports writers by buying their books by the dozen, Pelletier said. "I'll say, 'Janet, you bought my book a dozen times.' She'll reply, 'It's a gift for so-and-so.' I see books around my house that Janet sent, especially poetry collections: 'Thought you'd like this one,' scrawled inside," Pelletier wrote in an email. "It's her way of supporting the poet who wrote the book."
Pelletier described Mills as a poet at heart, loyal to the written word "and to those of us who create it in the trenches." She also described her friend as indefatigable. "I wish there were a shorter word, but it takes six syllables to aptly describe her," Pelletier wrote.
In an email, Blanco wrote: "The role of an inaugural poet, as I came to understand and experience it, is to reflect the vision of what a new administration may mean to our lives; not with respect to policy or politics, but rather, from a humanitarian point of view. The inaugural poem is not meant to be a political or policy speech; like any good poem, an inaugural poem is meant to appeal to our emotions, connect us all to our shared humanity, and evoke a new conversation. But perhaps the most important lesson I learned, and would share with Wes McNair, is this: an inaugural poem isn't solely about the occasion, but equally about what the poet feels about the occasion. In other words, it's as much a personal poem as it is a public one."
Joshua Bodwell, executive director of the Maine Writers & Publishers Alliance, said LePage's snub eight years ago galvanized people and helped motivate McNair and his successor, the current poet laureate, Stuart Kestenbaum, to create platforms for people to access poems as part of their daily lives. Since then, poems by Maine poets have been printed in newspapers across Maine, read on the radio and shared on social media. Hotels make poetry available to guests in their rooms.
"LePage might not have lit the proverbial fire, but he likely stoked it," Bodwell said. "His dismissiveness, his unnecessary crassness, served as a catalyzing moment. Would Wes and Stu -- and many others -- have launched and sustained great poetry initiatives over the past eight years had LePage not been so rude about his inauguration? Yes, I suppose so. But I think LePage's behavior helped focus those efforts. If we weren't loud enough promoters of Maine poetry back in 2010, I hope we've done quite a bit of good to get things pointed in the right direction now."
Bodwell was "deeply moved" when Mills attended the book launch for "Balancing Act 2" at Space and stood on stage to speak about poetry.
"I'm paraphrasing her here, of course, but she talked about what poetry has meant to her over the years, about how through poetry, reading and writing, we might come to understand ourselves better, and in doing so, then come to understand others around us better, too," Bodwell said. "She suggested, with a bit of a wink, that more politicians should read poetry. What a thought, eh?"

Texto completo: Crime and construction topped the 2018 stories of the year.
Weather, crime and construction topped the local news in the Augusta area in 2018, even as officials and residents across central Maine looked ahead to the New Year.
A classic January thaw brought more than moderate temperatures in the early weeks of 2018. Following weeks of frigid temperatures, the warm up, accompanied by heavy rain, set the stage for an ice jam in the Kennebec River south of Augusta as the ice that covered the river began to break up and pile up.
While Augusta officials had closed the Front Street parking lot before flooding started, Hallowell had little warning, resulting in more than a dozen cars on Front Street being submerged, and damage to about two dozen buildings.
To assuage concerns about a continued threat of flooding, the U.S. Coast Guard, at the request of Maine emergency management officials, launched a rare mid-winter ice breaking mission at the end of January to clear a path downriver for the accumulating ice to go. The mission was called off when the ice proved to be very thick and the flow of the river was insufficient to carry the broken chunks away.
The Coast Guard returned at the beginning of March and its cutters were able to clear a channel from Richmond to Gardiner, that alleviated concerns about flooding.
Ever since voters made recreational marijuana legal in Maine in 2016, city and town officials have been waiting for their state counterparts to make rules to govern the emerging cannabis market. In addition to allowing people to grow and possess limited amounts of marijuana for personal consumption, the citizens' initiative also allowed commercial marijuana enterprises.
During the year, the Maine State Legislature took on crafting rules for the adult-use recreational sales and revising rules for marijuana for medical use, ultimately overcoming the objections of Gov. Paul LePage.
While they waited, many cities and towns enacted or extended temporary bans to give them time to work out what they want to do, even as medical marijuana stores opened up across the region.
Augusta officials took that tack in May, imposing a temporary ban, even as officials neighboring Hallowell gave initial approval to a shop in their city.
The growth in caregiver stores has been fueled by the practice of cycling patients. Initially, caregivers were authorized to supply up to five card-carrying patients at a time. But a number have discharged one or more of the their five patients to take on new patients.
Gardiner enacted a temporary ban after two caregiver stores opened on Water Street, for instance, but in neighboring Richmond, a proposed moratorium was rejected at a special town meeting,
In November, Hallowell officials announced they would accept applications for two retail cannabis enterprises, making no distinction between adult-use and medical pot in downtown Hallowell. There is no limit outside downtown.
Three years and one week ago, police discovered the bodies of Eric Williams, 35, and Bonnie Royer, 26, in Williams' sport utility vehicle on Sanford Road in Manchester, not far from the couple's Easy Street home in Augusta.
In July, David W. Marble Jr., 32, was found guilty of their murders. Officials said the killings stemmed from the soured drug-related relationship between Marble and Williams, who had bought drugs from Marble and helped deal them. They said Williams stole items from Marble, including drugs and a gun, while Marble was in Portland on Christmas Eve in 2015, so Marble arranged for Williams, who was with Royer, to take him to a gravel pit in Manchester, where he shot them both in the head.
The case gained additional notoriety when Gov. Paul LePage said in a widely quoted statement that drug dealers were coming to Maine with names such as D-Money, Shifty and Smoothie, and "half the time they impregnate a young white girl before they leave."
A Brunswick man was cleared of all charges in October, stemming from a 2017 standoff in Belgrade that resulted in the death of one man.
Scott Bubar, 41, had been accused of aggravated attempted murder of a police officer and of reckless conduct with a dangerous weapon after police arrived at the home of his father Roger Bubar following a complaint by neighbors of a fight.
In an exchange of gunfire, Roger Bubar was killed and Scott Bubar was injured.
At the conclusion of his October non-jury trial, Justice Michaela Murphy said no DNA evidence tied Scott Bubar to either weapon used and Roger Bubar likely was responsible for all the shots fired from his Oakland Road home.
In April, three boys were charged in connection with the murder of Kimberly Mironovas in her Litchfield home, including Mironovas' son.
Lukas Mironovas, 15, and William Smith, 15, of Ashland, Massachusetts, have been charged with intentional or knowing murder and conspiracy to commit murder. The third boy, Thomas Severance, 13, also of Ashland, Massachusetts, is charged with conspiracy to commit murder.
In September, a Winthrop teen pleaded guilty to the murder of both parents in the early hours of Oct. 31, 2016. Andrew T. Balcer, who now identifies as a woman called Andrea, was sentenced to serve 40 years in prison for the murders of Antonio and Alice Balcer.
In a jailhouse interview with the Kennebec Journal days before the sentencing, Balcer alleged years of sexual and mental abuse by both parents. Balcer's older brother Christopher, refuted those allegations.
Christopher, who was in the family home at the time of the killings, had been spared.
In May, a Providence, Rhode Island man was sentenced to at least 20 years in prison for a home invasion and violent altercation in Sidney in 2017.
Dreaquan Foster, 23, changed his plea to guilty an apologized for his actions even as he continued to claim he had no memory of breaking into the Lyon Road home of Audrey Hewett, 84, or fighting with her son Eric who raced to help his mother. Eric Hewett spent 12 days in the hospital recovering from a concussion and skull fracture. After he was hit on the head with a claw hammer, Hewett wrestled with Foster and shot him in the chest before police arrived.
In August, the second part to a domestic violence murder-suicide played out in Gardiner, when police pulled over a driver on U.S. 201 following a report of erratic driving on Interstate 295. A man later identified as Gyrth Rutan, 34, of Sturbridge, Massachusetts, stepped out of his car and fatally shot himself. When they searched the vehicle, police discovered the body of Maddilynn Burgess, 28, who had been killed in Massachusetts. Rutan was a former Bangor resident.
In mid-December, a Richmond man shot and killed his longtime girlfriend before killing himself in their home on Post Road. The son of Niomi Mello, 37, found the bodies of his mother and Kirk Alexander Jr., 46, when he awoke and ran to a nearby convenience store to seek help on Dec. 15.
Steve McCausland, spokesman for the Maine Department of Public Safety, said about half the killings committed in Maine each year are the result of domestic violence.
An Augusta man was killed when he was struck by a pickup truck near a crosswalk between Swan Street and the Penney Memorial United Baptist Church in the early evening of Nov. 26.
Dana M. Williams, was leaving the LINC Wellness & Recovery Center, which serves people in distress where he was a volunteer, when he was struck and killed.
Two and a half weeks later, police identified the driver as Craig Conary, 59, of Augusta.
Two crashes in two days a quarter-mile apart in Liberty took the lives of three people in November.
On Nov. 27, a box truck driven by Dusan Dokic, 20, of Spanaway, Washington, crossed the center line in snowy conditions on Route 3 by Lake St. George State Park around 9:30 a.m., and struck a pickup truck driven by William Chadwick, 55, of Oakland. Chadwick was killed.
On Nov. 28, Janice Minson, 64, of Verona Island, died when her car crossed the center line on Route 3 and struck an oncoming pickup truck driven by Evan West, 20, of Liberty, around 5:30 p.m. Nine-year-old Kolby Adams of Hope, a passenger in the pickup, was killed instantly.
On Dec. 23, Suzanne Forti, 52, of Abington, Massachusetts, was killed when her car collided with a UPS delivery truck at the intersection of routes 197 and 201 in Richmond.
The accidents are under investigation.
Public and private construction projects across the region also made news in 2018.
Three fire stations, in Winthrop, Hallowell and Pittston, were completed during the year.
Winthrop officials secured $450,000 in grant funding from the Windover Foundation; the balance of the cost of the $1.8 million facility was financed through a USDA rural development loan.
Hallowell officials dedicated the city's new fire station at the end of July. An anonymous donor initially pledged $1 million, but also covered added costs totaling near $2 million for the fire station and community space in Stevens Common, the site of the former Stevens School.
Pittston officials replaced an aging and inadequate fire station in East Pittston with a larger building and equipped with state-of-the-art technology. The red-roofed station, at East Pittston and Kelley roads and named in honor of longtime firefighter Larry Ireland, cost $350,000.
For more than half the year, detours diverted some traffic off Water Street in Hallowell, as work started on the state Department of Transportation's plan to rebuild Water Street. The $5 million project included rebuilding the street from just north of Winthrop Street to the boat launch, encompassing the downtown retail district. To combat an expected slowdown in business, the Down with the Crown committee was formed to execute a marketing campaign to promote the downtown during construction. As part of the project, the historic Dummer House was picked up and spun 180 degrees from Dummers Lane to Central Street so the city could create a downtown parking lot.
At the V.A. Maine Healthcare Systems -- Togus campus, two projects by private organizations are bringing changes to the facility that dates to the end of the Civil War.
In August, work started on a Fisher House at Togus. The Fisher House Foundation builds and donates to the U.S. government hotels where families of veterans seeking care at VA facilities can stay for free. The Fisher House at Togus, on the Augusta-Chelsea line, will house 16 suites and common areas, including kitchen, dining and laundry facilities.
In September, the long-awaited Cabin in the Woods welcomed its first residents. The $5.1 million project, developed by the Volunteers of America -- Northern New England, included small homes on 11 acres leased from the Veterans Affairs Administration for longterm housing for homeless veterans.
In Monmouth, students and officials broke ground on a new $26.7 middle-elementary school, which will be located next to Monmouth Academy. The 70,000-square-foot facility is expected to be completed in January 2020. It replaces the aging elementary and middle schools. Regional School Unit 2's only cost was nearly $72,000 to acquire the land.
In November, officials with Bread of Life Ministries broke ground on a project to expand the organization's shelters for the homeless. With a plan to raise $510,000, the goal is to add to the veterans and family shelters in Augusta, doubling the number of beds and creating more rooms.
Capping months of conflict -- including a move by school district administrators to form a union -- and just ahead of a school district no-confidence vote, Gary Rosenthal resigned in March as superintendent of the Winthrop School Department. In a letter to staff, Rosenthal said he would step down at the end of June due to irreconcilable differences with members of the administration.
The Maine Education Association sent a memo to district employees detailing complaints against Rosenthal, including inappropriate comments about employees and pregnant women.
Rosenthal declined to talk about the allegations, referring questions to his attorney, Maria Fox. Fox said confidentiality laws prevented Rosenthal from answering the allegations against him.
A year before, the Winthrop Town Council voted 5-1 in favor of a no-confidence resolution, accusing Rosenthal of repeated budget errors and "attempts to cover up the truth."
While he and town officials had disagreed over school funding and the origin of a financial error that led to a large deficit in the school budget, the school board continued to support him.
He had been with the district since 2011.
In May, the school committee hired Cornelia "Connie" Brown as interim superintendent staring July 1. She had worked for nearly 14 years as the superintendent of the Augusta School Department.
Two disputes during the year caught the public's attention.
In September, the Poulin family of Augusta learned that the route family members had taken for decades to reach their Boothby Street home would no longer be accessible because it crossed the City of Augusta's public works site.
The only other access is up a flight of 100 stairs up a steep hill from Boothby Street.
Monique Poulin said the alternate access was needed because her husband Robert has had back surgeries and her mother Lorraine Piteau has Alzheimer's disease and back and hip problems.
The Poulins filed suit in November to maintain access, and in December, Augusta City Councilors unanimously approved a temporary agreement so the family can continue to drive across city property.
An attorney for the Poulin family said the temporary agreement could be the basis of a longer-term solution if the arrangement works out for both his clients and the city. The lawsuit remains in place and will move ahead unless a settlement is reached.
In a dispute that's ongoing, the partnership that created Central Maine Meats, a slaughterhouse in Gardiner, fell apart.
In April, the company filed for Chapter 12 bankruptcy protection, citing debts to creditors including the Internal Revenue Service, Central Maine Power and the city of Gardiner totaling between $100,000 and $500,000. Chapter 12 is a relatively new chapter, that allows family farmers to avoid liquidation or foreclosure by restructuring finances, but the bankruptcy was converted to a Chapter 7 bankruptcy under which company assets are sold to pay off creditors.
During its nearly three years in operation, the company staked out its territory, offering a local USDA-inspected option for farmers to send their animals to. It was able to secure more than $1 million in state and federal funding for economic development and workforce training.
The company, which was adding on services and functions such as a smoker, flash-freezing and halal butchery, was part of Gardiner's food hub movement and added jobs to the local economy.
In the weeks before the bankruptcy filing, Joel Davis became the sole owner, leaving his former partner Bill Lovely as landlord.
In a separate action, Davis is suing Lovely in the state's Business and Consumer Court, alleging fraudulent dealings.
Both court actions are ongoing.

New park manager to lead hike

Texto completo: POWNAL -- At his last post, in the Allagash Wilderness Waterway, Caribou native Chris Silsbee had a four-hour commute to work, left his family for nine days at a time to live in the woods and might see more deer than people on any given day.
Two years ago, deciding his family was ready for a change, they moved the farthest south they've ever lived, to Bradbury Mountain State Park.
"Depending on the time of year up on the Allagash, it could be days before I'd see somebody," said Silsbee, 41. "Being so close to a high-populated areas down here, Bradbury is kind of nice because it's so close to everything, yet once you're here, you kind of feel like you are quite a ways away."
On Jan. 1, he'll lead his second First Day Hike as the park manager. It's a part of a national park program to get people out and active.
Nationwide, nearly 55,000 people participated last year, according to StateParks.org, logging 133,000 miles.
At Bradbury, they'll log just two: One mile up to the summit via the Northern Loop Trail and one mile back down on the Terrace Trail.
It's free to the public and takes off at 10 a.m.
"I'll be telling about the ecosystem here, the animals we have living here, a lot of the park history," Silsbee said. "If we see animal tracks, we'll stop and look."
Growing up in Caribou, Silsbee said he always loved the outdoors. At the University of Maine at Presque Isle, he got involved with the outing club and outdoor rec program.
His first job with the state was as a college intern with the Maine Forest Service and sent out West to fight fires.
"It wasn't anything too drastic," Silsbee said. "It was big fire danger year that year, there were many fires in many different states. I bounced around a lot: Washington, Idaho, Utah."
His first ranger position was as an assistant at Lily Bay State Park in Greenville for three years. From there, he spent six years in the Penobscot River Corridor and seven in the Allagash as what's called a back country ranger. Think lots of woods, few people and 11-hour working days.
Work was typically nine days on, four to five days off, and in the early part of his career, cellphone and Wi-Fi-free.
"You get up and you patrol your area, take care of your campsites, make sure you're around to help people when they get into trouble," he said. "At the end of the day you get back to your ranger cabin. I would spend my evenings fishing and just kind of going for a paddle in my kayak."
Silsbee, who is also manager of Mackworth Island State Park outside of Falmouth, said his family has settled in nicely to the house provided inside the park.
"It's a big house -- I've got four kids, so we filled it," he said. "Early in my career I never thought I'd find myself this far south, but living here now for a couple years, I've come to enjoy it."

Texto completo: Lack of quality assurance risks contamination; rule changes coming, but advocates warn against overregulation
For years, Sharon Corbett would consume a gram of highly concentrated cannabis oil every week hoping to ward off a return of her esophageal cancer.
The 68-year-old Lincolnville retiree believed that $25-a-gram oil was saving her life. But over the summer, when she started feeling sick, a friend urged her to get it tested. A private lab concluded the oil contained high levels of naphtha, a chemical solvent used as a paint thinner or lighter fluid that can contain cancer-causing substances and is illegal to use in marijuana extractions in Colorado and Massachusetts.
"One day, I've got my oncologist telling me, 'I don't know what you're doing, but whatever it is, keep doing it,' and I think everything's great," said Corbett. "Then I open an email from the lab telling me I've been taking a daily dose of paint thinner for years. Even my doctor doesn't know what that's done to me, but it can't be good."
In Maine, nobody is checking to see if the cannabis sold now is safe. Medical marijuana has been legal since 1999, with 50,000 certified patients purchasing $50 million of cannabis a year to treat conditions ranging from glaucoma to AIDS, yet none of it must be tested. Oregon, Washington and Colorado test their medical marijuana for contaminants like mold, residual solvents and bacteria. Maine forbids the use of high-risk pesticides but doesn't test for it.
The Maine Medical Association calls marijuana contamination "one of the most significant risks" facing the legal market. Threats can range from E. coli poisoning to deadly lung infections, but many of the risks cannot be accurately calculated because federally funded researchers are limited in their ability to study marijuana, much less the contamination risks posed by the many different ways that adults are legally using it in 33 U.S. states.
One marijuana testing lab says that Maine's medical marijuana is rife with contaminants of all kinds, ranging from high levels of residual solvents like naphtha or rubbing alcohol in concentrates, to mold and bacteria, to pesticides. According to Nick Des Lauriers, the business manager of ProVerde Laboratories in Portland, failing cannabis products are the norm in Maine.
"There are some bad people out there doing some pretty shady things to make a quick buck that could make people really sick," Des Lauriers said.
Falmouth doctor Dustin Sulak, a cannabis specialist, says with help, most patients can grow their own cannabis and even learn how to correctly create the proper concentrations and doses. He cautions patients about buying medical marijuana because of purity concerns, especially for the very young and very old consumers, Sulak said, as well as those who have seizures, chemical sensitivity or neurological illnesses.
"Nine years in, there is still not a single product in the marketplace that I can say with absolute certainty is quality-assured, for labeling of active ingredients or for freedom from contamination," said Sulak, whose medical practice treats or consults on more than 8,000 medical marijuana cases. "I'm sad to say there isn't a single product in the state that I can be certain meets my standards."
With the rollout of Maine's recreational market looming in 2019, however, the marijuana testing landscape is about to change.
Maine will require mandatory potency and safety tests for marijuana that will be sold to the 325,000 Mainers and 8.5 million tourists expected to participate in the new recreational market. The state Department of Administrative and Financial Services has hired BOTEC Analysis of Los Angeles to help it pick which tests will be done on which products, establish acceptable limits for marijuana contaminants, and determine what happens when products fail.
Currently, Maine has just one medical marijuana consumer safety law on the books: only minimum-risk pesticides, like cinnamon and peppermint oil, are allowed. But Maine doesn't release medical cannabis enforcement data, or even the number of times it inspects its eight dispensaries or 2,900 medical caregivers, so it is not clear if anyone breaks the pesticide law or if patients have complained about it. The state has denied repeated requests from the Portland Press Herald/Maine Sunday Telegram for this information.
The agency, which will oversee both adult-use and medical marijuana, wants to apply mandatory testing rules to all cannabis, including medical, said spokesman David Heidrich. It will try to do that through an administrative process, but if needed, DAFS will ask state lawmakers to adopt a medical marijuana consumer safety law, he said.
In the absence of mandated testing, medical marijuana consumers are on their own to assess the purity of their medicine.
Christine Chicoine followed a doctor's recommendation when deciding who would make oil for her now 16-year-old daughter, who has pain from a childhood bout of Henoch-Schönlein purpura, a disease that causes swelling of the small blood vessels. The 39-year-old Waldo County mother sought an oil with almost no THC, the intoxicating ingredient of cannabis. She wanted it extracted using food-grade alcohol to protect her daughter's immune-compromised system.
The doctor referred her to LoveGrown, a Farmington caregiving operation run by Erica and Jack Haywood that advertises medical-grade cannabis and hemp.
"It was organic this and organic that, we never do this and we always do that," Chicoine recalls. "Based on the way she talked, she is the last person I'd have ever expected to mess around with a child's medicine. I can't tell you how many times she preached to me about the evils of isopropyl alcohol. It's junk and it will make you sick, she said. Well, guess what was used to make my daughter's oil?"
Her daughter had been taking the oil for about a month when the itching started. Headaches and stomachaches followed. Chicoine sent the oil to a lab for testing, which showed rubbing alcohol was used to extract the oil. Her daughter stopped using the hemp oil and her symptoms faded. Instead, Chicoine treated her with a low-THC tincture made from her personal medical marijuana grow until she eventually found a new caregiver who tests every batch of hemp oil.
"I'm not a big government person, but I think anything for a kid, it ought to be tested," Chicoine said.
Robin Crawley was also a LoveGrown patient. The raw hemp oil extract the Vassalboro information technology specialist bought from Erica Haywood was a lot stronger than Chicoine's, as it hadn't been diluted. When she began to feel sick, she took the oil to a testing lab. It contained 17,620 parts per million of rubbing alcohol, or more than three times the Massachusetts legal limit, results show.
Crawley is angry, but she doesn't want to say anything that could prompt regulators to require unreasonable tests that could drive up prices or hurt the community.
"It was an ugly thing, all around, causing a big uproar, but I never stopped believing in the plant or the program," she said. "Now I ask a lot of questions and I test when I can."
Haywood blamed the problem on a third-party processor. LoveGrown had started to grow so much hemp that its board decided to farm out the extraction, like most Maine caregivers were doing at the time. Haywood instructed the extractor to use food-grade ethanol, but didn't test the oil she got back for contamination. The third-party processor, Wholesale International, said it warned Haywood the extraction had gone awry but that she sold it to patients anyway.
"No way should that stuff have been sold to patients," said Matt Fournier, one of Wholesale International's principals.
The dispute devolved into a he said/she said argument, with Haywood saying Fournier never told her the extraction had failed, while he claims he did.
In the aftermath, LoveGrown tested the product on its own, informed a third client who had bought the contaminated oil and offered the client refunds, according to Haywood. LoveGrown now always does its own extractions, in house, even if it takes longer to do it, Haywood said.
Despite the risks, the marijuana industry worries mandatory testing could slow down the rollout of the adult-use market and drive up the price of medical cannabis. Some caregivers question the accuracy of the results, claiming that different labs will come back with widely varying results from tests performed on the very same batch of cannabis products, depending on the kind of equipment the lab uses.
Maine doesn't have any state-licensed cannabis testing labs yet. State lawmakers passed a law requiring medical marijuana test labs to be state-licensed, but the law was never implemented by Gov. Paul LePage's administration. But DAFS is now working with the Colorado firm of Freedman & Koski to develop rules to start issuing state laboratory licenses soon. Independently accredited labs can operate without those rules in place now, however.
Currently, Maine has two independent cannabis labs: ProVerde Labs, which opened a new Portland lab in November, and Tested Labs in Kennebunk, which was started by Sulak, the Falmouth doctor, but sold to Nelson Analytical in 2017. Some Mainers use Massachusetts labs, but they take the risk of crossing state lines with a federally illegal drug. With just two Maine labs, however, customers can expect to wait two to four weeks for results unless they pay higher rush fees.
A full slate of tests -- potency, residual solvents, pesticides, heavy metals, fungus and bacteria -- costs $550. If mandatory testing is expanded into Maine's medical market, small-time caregivers who produce relatively small harvests could get priced out of the market and patients would likely see the price of their flower, salve, oil or edible go up as producers pass along at least some of the higher production costs.
At least two other labs have expressed interest in coming to Maine once the state begins licensing labs, which could help cut down on testing delays and prices.
Most of Maine's eight medical marijuana dispensaries have developed in-house labs to help fine-tune their manufacturing process and confirm both potency and consumer safety and use ProVerde and Nelson labs to independently confirm those results. Now that Maine allows wholesale medical cannabis sales, dispensary managers say they will use outside labs to run a full panel of purity tests on all third-party cannabis before selling it.
Those third-party cannabis tests have been surprising for Wellness Connection CEO Patricia Rosi, who runs four of Maine's eight dispensaries. About half of those who approach Wellness about wholesale opportunities balk when they find out Wellness is only interested if they can visit the grower's cultivation site. Of those that agree to a visit, only 29 percent can pass the outside testing screening, with most failures stemming from too much yeast or mold in the smokable marijuana.
Wellness has had its own contaminant trouble. In 2013, the state fined Wellness $18,000 for using pesticides at a time when state law prohibited the use of any pesticides in cannabis production. After the investigation, Wellness and other dispensaries successfully lobbied for a law allowing minimum-risk pesticides, like peppermint oil or cinnamon. Now, Wellness relies on integrated pest management to do the work of pesticides.
According to Rosi, the pesticide violation forced Wellness to become a leader in producing clean cannabis. Now the company is lobbying Maine to implement mandatory testing for all medical marijuana, both as a protection for patients as well as a market equalizer, she said. The law will force caregivers, who are the dispensaries' top rivals for medical marijuana patients, to meet the same quality standards and pay the same testing costs as dispensaries do, she said.
Sulak launched Tested Labs in 2013 to help him calculate the potency of the cannabis that his patients were buying from caregivers and dispensaries. Without it, he couldn't establish safe, effective dosage levels. Patient after patient would come into his office with an unmarked bottle of cannabis oil and ask him how much they should take. Without testing, he wouldn't even know what was inside, much less how much of it they should take.
But Sulak does not think the answer to the substandard quality lies in mandatory testing. That would force caregivers out of business and undermine the diversity of the Maine market, which is its greatest strength, Sulak said. The state's patchwork network of 3,000 caregivers and eight dispensaries allows for thousands of different cannabis products made from a dizzying array of plant strains, he said. Curb that and patients will suffer.
"Put it in the hands of the consumer and let them decide, just like they do at the grocery store," Sulak said. "Do they buy organic food or not?"
Data from regional hospital intakes and poison control records indicate that Maine consumers haven't been getting sick from contaminated marijuana. The Northern New England Poison Control Center received fewer than 15 calls about contaminated cannabis over the last three years, and none of those led to hospitalization, according to director Karen Simone. But it's too early to say what long-term exposure to marijuana contaminants will do, she warned.
In the last year, ProVerde has seen potency testing in Maine steadily grow, but contaminant testing only spikes when a shocked patient like Crawley posts failing test results on Facebook, Des Lauriers said. The lab usually keeps its mouth shut when it comes to test findings, especially since Maine does not have any rules, but occasionally it comes across something so shocking, like Corbett's results, that it will send out a warning email to customers.
Corbett ended up with a naphtha-contaminated oil because of price. Some caregivers had charged her as much as $100 a gram, but the caregiver who used the naphtha to make the oil only charged her $20. She believed that was because she got a price break as a full-time patient, usually bought in bulk at harvest time when the price of marijuana drops, and bought from somebody who worked out of his home, who didn't have to factor in the overhead costs of running a store.
According to ProVerde, which tested Corbett's oil, the product contained 1,339 parts per million of naphtha-related chemicals. Because marijuana is still illegal on the federal level, national food and drug regulators won't weigh in on naphtha marijuana extractions. And there are no clinical medical trials showing the impact of a long-term exposure to its use in cannabis oil, but regulators warn that naphtha levels of 1,000 parts per million are immediately dangerous to life and health.
Corbett isn't angry with her caregiver, who was just following an online recipe, and refused to name him. She still buys smokable cannabis from him.
Corbett doesn't know if the depression and respiratory problems she experienced while using the naphtha-made oil were related to the residual solvent, or if they were linked to her cancer, but they have gotten better since she stopped using the contaminated extract. The lack of reliable medical research on cannabis, or its contaminants, leaves her doctors unable to predict how long-term daily exposure to naphtha may impact Corbett's future health.
Doctors also can't say what role cannabis played in Corbett's recovery from cancer. Without clinical trials in thousands of human subjects, the National Institute on Drug Abuse says the federal government can't properly assess the benefits and risks of medical marijuana, but it notes the cannabis plant may contain chemicals that help treat a range of illnesses and symptoms. Research in mice shows marijuana extracts may help kill certain cancer cells and reduce the size of others.
Corbett considered forgoing the oil altogether, but her oncologist's warning -- "nobody survives esophageal cancer, even with surgery. ... I can't explain why you're still here" -- drove her back out into the medical marijuana marketplace looking for the perfect mix of purity and affordability. What she found was New World Organics, a caregiver storefront in Belfast, where shopkeeper Justin Olsen gives her a cannabis oil made with food-grade alcohol every month for free.
"The neediest patients are oftentimes the ones least able to afford treatment," said Olsen. "I believe in the power of healing through cannabis."

Texto completo: POWNAL -- At his last post, in the Allagash Wilderness Waterway, Caribou native Chris Silsbee had a four-hour commute to work, left his family for nine days at a time to live in the woods and might see more deer than people on any given day.
Two years ago, deciding his family was ready for a change, they moved the farthest south they've ever lived, to Bradbury Mountain State Park.
"Depending on the time of year up on the Allagash, it could be days before I'd see somebody," said Silsbee, 41. "Being so close to a high-populated areas down here, Bradbury is kind of nice because it's so close to everything, yet once you're here, you kind of feel like you are quite a ways away."
On Jan. 1, he'll lead his second First Day Hike as the park manager. It's a part of a national park program to get people out and active.
Nationwide, nearly 55,000 people participated last year, according to StateParks.org, logging 133,000 miles.
At Bradbury, they'll log just two: One mile up to the summit via the Northern Loop Trail and one mile back down on the Terrace Trail.
It's free to the public and takes off at 10 a.m.
"I'll be telling about the ecosystem here, the animals we have living here, a lot of the park history," Silsbee said. "If we see animal tracks, we'll stop and look."
Growing up in Caribou, Silsbee said he always loved the outdoors. At the University of Maine at Presque Isle, he got involved with the outing club and outdoor rec program.
His first job with the state was as a college intern with the Maine Forest Service and sent out West to fight fires.
"It wasn't anything too drastic," Silsbee said. "It was big fire danger year that year, there were many fires in many different states. I bounced around a lot: Washington, Idaho, Utah."
His first ranger position was as an assistant at Lily Bay State Park in Greenville for three years. From there, he spent six years in the Penobscot River Corridor and seven in the Allagash as what's called a back country ranger. Think lots of woods, few people and 11-hour working days.
Work was typically nine days on, four to five days off, and in the early part of his career, cellphone and Wi-Fi-free.
"You get up and you patrol your area, take care of your campsites, make sure you're around to help people when they get into trouble," he said. "At the end of the day you get back to your ranger cabin. I would spend my evenings fishing and just kind of going for a paddle in my kayak."
Silsbee, who is also manager of Mackworth Island State Park outside of Falmouth, said his family has settled in nicely to the house provided inside the park.
"It's a big house -- I've got four kids, so we filled it," he said. "Early in my career I never thought I'd find myself this far south, but living here now for a couple years, I've come to enjoy it."

Texto completo: RUMFORD -- Ski patrol apprentice Maia Belskis, 17, of Rumford, finds it rewarding to know she can help if someone gets hurt skiing.
The Mountain Valley High School junior is in her third year participating in Black Mountain of Maine's Ski Patrol Apprenticeship program. It gives Mountain Valley students the opportunity to learn about the ski industry -- from on-hill medical training and rescue evacuation to the logistics of running equipment and the economics of the business.
Belskis also volunteers for MedCare ambulance service. These experiences are giving her training to enter a medical field; she hopes to become a nurse anesthetist. "Everything that goes into this I have a passion for," she said.
Students who participate in the program must have a letter of recommendation and be in good standing as a student. They must also be experienced skiers.
"You need to be able to get to a scene quickly," said Belskis, who learned to ski at Black Mountain when she was 6.
The nonprofit ski area has youth in mind with most of its offerings, including ski camps, lessons and free passes for children in grades kindergarten to second.
Black Mountain opened for the season Dec. 26, said Amanda Carey, who was selling lift tickets Saturday with her mother, Kathy Carey.
It will offer two 12-week race camps for children ages 7 to 18. Those new to skiing can learn by participating in Kinder Club, for ages 3 to 6, or Snow Kids, ages 7 to 14, which last six weeks. Individual lessons are also available.
The mountain has 5 kilometers of Nordic trails open. It will offer tubing in January once more snow can be made, according to Kathy Carey. Eleven trails are open to downhill skiing and snowboarding, she said.
Skiers and snowboarders can look forward to Free Ski nights when local businesses sponsor lift passes. These are usually from 4 to 9 p.m. Thursdays. Dates will be announced on the ski area's website, skiblackmountain.org. To accommodate those on holiday break, the ski area is open Friday to Tuesday from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.
Beginning Friday, Jan. 11, the regular hours will be Fridays and Saturdays, from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., and Sundays from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Lift passes are $40 for Rumford residents and $45 for nonresidents.

Lyme reporting declines in 2018

Texto completo: Maine experienced a dramatic drop-off in reported Lyme disease cases in 2018, and the dry weather this past summer may have played a role.
The state recorded 1,310 Lyme cases through Dec. 27, according to the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention, down from 1,852 in 2017. That represents a 29 percent decrease, although the final number of cases may rise slightly because of a lag in reporting. Lyme is an infectious disease caused by the deer tick, which has expanded its range in Maine over the past 20 years.
Lyme disease cases had climbed every year in Maine since 2011 -- except for 2015 -- before falling off in 2018.
The 1,852 Lyme cases in 2017 represented an all-time high, and the tick-borne illness has persisted in Maine as a public health threat, as there have been more than 1,000 reported cases per year since 2011. Lyme disease can cause flu-like symptoms, swelling, neurological problems like Bell's palsy and joint pain.
Some, but not all, people get a bull's-eye rash where they were bitten by a tick. If caught early, Lyme disease can be treated with antibiotics, but untreated it can cause long-term health problems, especially in the joints and nervous system, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Anaplasmosis, another disease caused by the deer tick, also experienced a sharp decline in 2018, from 663 cases in 2017 to 476 cases through Dec. 27 this year.
Researchers are still learning about what causes fluctuations in deer tick populations and interactions with humans. In addition to Lyme cases being down, there were fewer dead tick submissions to the University of Maine Cooperative Extension, and fewer ticks showing up in field surveys conducted by Maine Medical Center Research Institute staff.
"The big challenge for tick survival may not be the winter, but may be the summer," said Susan Elias, a research associate at the Maine Medical Center Research Institute in Scarborough, which studies the arachnids and Lyme disease.
Rainfall was below average this summer, while high temperatures in July and August were higher than average, according to the National Weather Service in Gray.
Elias said researchers have been examining how the deer tick survives in its southern range, such as Georgia or South Carolina. In the South, the ticks can survive in the hot weather, but they stay below leaf litter and do not seek humans as hosts as frequently, instead preferring low-traveling animals like lizards, she said.
"Ticks are like Goldilocks. It can't be too hot or too cold or too dry. It has to be just right," Elias said. "But they are experts at finding the right microclimate for them, so if it's too hot and dry, for instance, they will retreat under the leaf litter."
Still, if the weather is hot and dry enough for an extended period, that could lead to reduced tick populations, researchers say.
Researchers will be comparing Maine's dry summer of 2016 with this year's summer, looking at humidity and temperature patterns, to see if there's any correlation with tick activity. In 2016, Lyme cases were down in the summer but came back stronger in the fall, and Maine ended up with 1,464 cases that year.
This year, Lyme cases started strong in the spring and early summer but fell off in the late summer, compared to previous years, and did not rebound in the fall, like they did in 2016.
Extreme cold temperatures without snow can also kill ticks, but the temperatures have to be consistently below or near 0 degrees Fahrenheit for weeks before researchers believe tick populations would be significantly affected. Snow acts as an insulator and helps ticks survive the winter.
Griffin Dill, integrated pest management professional at the University of Maine Cooperative Extension, said it's difficult to tell whether 2017 was an aberration or whether 2018 represents a one-year drop-off before Lyme cases climb again.
Dill said there were 20 percent fewer tick identification submissions to the University of Maine's "tick lab" this year, with a steeper decline in the fall. People who are bitten by ticks can submit them to the lab for identification.
"Fall is usually a very active time for ticks, but not this year," Dill said. "There also may not have been as many opportunities for tick-human interactions."
Dill said the snow and colder temperatures that arrived in November probably reduced tick activity at a time when people were still outside. For instance, hunters may have come across fewer active ticks.
"In those conditions, there's not going to be a lot of tick activity," he said.
Researchers are also studying how Lyme may correlate with the rodent population. Maine had an abundance of squirrels in 2018, probably caused by a higher-than-normal acorn crop in 2017. The theory is that the increased rodent population this year will result in more ticks next year, but Dill said he's skeptical of that, and more research is needed.

Texto completo: The Nordic ski season is well under way at the Quarry Road Trails, where colder-than-normal temperatures in early November allowed for a jump start on the snowmaking season and the earliest opening day ever.
The trails, part of a more than 200-acre facility owned by the city of Waterville, offer over 13 kilometers of groomed cross-country ski trails, including about 3 kilometers with the capability for snowmaking.
"Natural snow hasn't really materialized the way anyone would like, but we've been able to make snow and have a really good base 2.5 kilometer loop," said Dave MacLeay, president of the board of Friends of Quarry Road, a non-profit group that supports the city's operations at the trails.
"It's been pulling a lot of folks from around the state, especially the southern part, who are looking at Quarry Road as a place they can go and get on snow, whether it's the high school or college ski teams or just folks who want to get out. It's a nice resource to have and we're fortunate we have snowmaking to provide that experience for folks."
Volunteers assist the city's Parks and Recreation Department with snowmaking and also staff the welcome center at the Quarry Road Trails.
Snowmaking is often done at night, especially early in the season, to capitalize on colder temperatures and avoid disrupting skiers.
The 2017-2018 winter season saw 521 season passes sold, about 50 percent to Waterville residents, and 924 day tickets sold. MacLeay said this year's sales are on track for higher numbers.
Friends of Quarry Road also runs the Central Maine Ski Club after-school ski program, which is in session starting in January and has over 120 children -- the most the program has seen to date -- signed up, MacLeay said.
"We're excited it's grown year over year," he said. "It's nice to see that effort and investment start to take root."

Texto completo: A Maine man was not seriously hurt but will face several charges after his speeding car hit a guardrail on Interstate 295 and flipped down onto Marginal Way in Portland, according to the Maine State Police.
State Trooper Joe Royle said witnesses reported spotting a silver Lexus being operated erratically in the northbound lanes at a high speed about 10:30 a.m. Saturday, weaving in and out of traffic, when it spun across the three lanes, hit the guardrail and flipped over the rail onto the street below. The sedan landed on its tires near the U-Haul building on Marginal Way.
The man was taken to Maine Medical Center with minor lacerations. He was charged with driving to endanger and will face other charges, Royle said.
His name is not being released at this time, Royle said.
There were no passengers in the Lexus and no one else was hurt.

Texto completo: Crime and construction topped the 2018 stories of the year.
Weather, construction,
top Augusta-area news
Weather, crime and construction topped the local news in the Augusta area in 2018, even as officials and residents across central Maine looked ahead to the New Year.
A classic January thaw brought more than moderate temperatures in the early weeks of 2018. Following weeks of frigid temperatures, the warm up, accompanied by heavy rain, set the stage for an ice jam in the Kennebec River south of Augusta as the ice that covered the river began to break up and pile up.
While Augusta officials had closed the Front Street parking lot before flooding started, Hallowell had little warning, resulting in more than a dozen cars on Front Street being submerged, and damage to about two dozen buildings.
To assuage concerns about a continued threat of flooding, the U.S. Coast Guard, at the request of Maine emergency management officials, launched a rare mid-winter ice breaking mission at the end of January to clear a path downriver for the accumulating ice to go. The mission was called off when the ice proved to be very thick and the flow of the river was insufficient to carry the broken chunks away.
The Coast Guard returned at the beginning of March and its cutters were able to clear a channel from Richmond to Gardiner, that alleviated concerns about flooding.
Three years and one week ago, police discovered the bodies of Eric Williams, 35, and Bonnie Royer, 26, in Williams' sport utility vehicle on Sanford Road in Manchester, not far from the couple's Easy Street home in Augusta.
In July, David W. Marble Jr., 32, was found guilty of their murders. Officials said the killings stemmed from the soured drug-related relationship between Marble and Williams, who had bought drugs from Marble and helped deal them. They said Williams stole items from Marble, including drugs and a gun, while Marble was in Portland on Christmas Eve in 2015, so Marble arranged for Williams, who was with Royer, to take him to a gravel pit in Manchester, where he shot them both in the head.
The case gained additional notoriety when Gov. Paul LePage said in a widely quoted statement that drug dealers were coming to Maine with names such as D-Money, Shifty and Smoothie, and "half the time they impregnate a young white girl before they leave."
A Brunswick man was cleared of all charges in October, stemming from a 2017 standoff in Belgrade that resulted in the death of one man.
Scott Bubar, 41, had been accused of aggravated attempted murder of a police officer and of reckless conduct with a dangerous weapon after police arrived at the home of his father Roger Bubar following a complaint by neighbors of a fight.
In an exchange of gunfire, Roger Bubar was killed and Scott Bubar was injured.
At the conclusion of his October non-jury trial, Justice Michaela Murphy said no DNA evidence tied Scott Bubar to either weapon used and Roger Bubar likely was responsible for all the shots fired from his Oakland Road home.
In April, three boys were charged in connection with the murder of Kimberly Mironovas in her Litchfield home, including Mironovas' son.
Lukas Mironovas, 15, and William Smith, 15, of Ashland, Massachusetts, have been charged with intentional or knowing murder and conspiracy to commit murder. The third boy, Thomas Severance, 13, also of Ashland, Massachusetts, is charged with conspiracy to commit murder.
In September, a Winthrop teen pleaded guilty to the murder of both parents in the early hours of Oct. 31, 2016. Andrew T. Balcer, who now identifies as a woman called Andrea, was sentenced to serve 40 years in prison for the murders of Antonio and Alice Balcer.
In a jailhouse interview with the Kennebec Journal days before the sentencing, Balcer alleged years of sexual and mental abuse by both parents. Balcer's older brother Christopher, refuted those allegations.
Christopher, who was in the family home at the time of the killings, had been spared.
In May, a Providence, Rhode Island man was sentenced to at least 20 years in prison for a home invasion and violent altercation in Sidney in 2017.
Dreaquan Foster, 23, changed his plea to guilty an apologized for his actions even as he continued to claim he had no memory of breaking into the Lyon Road home of Audrey Hewett, 84, or fighting with her son Eric who raced to help his mother. Eric Hewett spent 12 days in the hospital recovering from a concussion and skull fracture. After he was hit on the head with a claw hammer, Hewett wrestled with Foster and shot him in the chest before police arrived.
Public and private construction projects across the region also made news in 2018.
Three fire stations, in Winthrop, Hallowell and Pittston, were completed during the year.
Winthrop officials secured $450,000 in grant funding from the Windover Foundation; the balance of the cost of the $1.8 million facility was financed through a USDA rural development loan.
Hallowell officials dedicated the city's new fire station at the end of July. An anonymous donor initially pledged $1 million, but also covered added costs totaling near $2 million for the fire station and community space in Stevens Common, the site of the former Stevens School.
Pittston officials replaced an aging and inadequate fire station in East Pittston with a larger building and equipped with state-of-the-art technology. The red-roofed station, at East Pittston and Kelley roads and named in honor of longtime firefighter Larry Ireland, cost $350,000.
For more than half the year, detours diverted some traffic off Water Street in Hallowell, as work started on the state Department of Transportation's plan to rebuild Water Street. The $5 million project included rebuilding the street from just north of Winthrop Street to the boat launch, encompassing the downtown retail district. To combat an expected slowdown in business, the Down with the Crown committee was formed to execute a marketing campaign to promote the downtown during construction. As part of the project, the historic Dummer House was picked up and spun 180 degrees from Dummers Lane to Central Street so the city could create a downtown parking lot.
At the V.A. Maine Healthcare Systems -- Togus campus, two projects by private organizations are bringing changes to the facility that dates to the end of the Civil War.
In August, work started on a Fisher House at Togus. The Fisher House Foundation builds and donates to the U.S. government hotels where families of veterans seeking care at VA facilities can stay for free. The Fisher House at Togus, on the Augusta-Chelsea line, will house 16 suites and common areas, including kitchen, dining and laundry facilities.
In September, the long-awaited Cabin in the Woods welcomed its first residents. The $5.1 million project, developed by the Volunteers of America -- Northern New England, included small homes on 11 acres leased from the Veterans Affairs Administration for longterm housing for homeless veterans.
In Monmouth, students and officials broke ground on a new $26.7 middle-elementary school, which will be located next to Monmouth Academy. The 70,000-square-foot facility is expected to be completed in January 2020. It replaces the aging elementary and middle schools. Regional School Unit 2's only cost was nearly $72,000 to acquire the land.
In November, officials with Bread of Life Ministries broke ground on a project to expand the organization's shelters for the homeless. With a plan to raise $510,000, the goal is to add to the veterans and family shelters in Augusta, doubling the number of beds and creating more rooms.
Capping months of conflict -- including a move by school district administrators to form a union -- and just ahead of a school district no-confidence vote, Gary Rosenthal resigned in March as superintendent of the Winthrop School Department. In a letter to staff, Rosenthal said he would step down at the end of June due to irreconcilable differences with members of the administration.
The Maine Education Association sent a memo to district employees detailing complaints against Rosenthal, including inappropriate comments about employees and pregnant women.
Rosenthal declined to talk about the allegations, referring questions to his attorney, Maria Fox. Fox said confidentiality laws prevented Rosenthal from answering the allegations against him.
A year before, the Winthrop Town Council voted 5-1 in favor of a no-confidence resolution, accusing Rosenthal of repeated budget errors and "attempts to cover up the truth."
While he and town officials had disagreed over school funding and the origin of a financial error that led to a large deficit in the school budget, the school board continued to support him.
He had been with the district since 2011.
In May, the school committee hired Cornelia "Connie" Brown as interim superintendent staring July 1. She had worked for nearly 14 years as the superintendent of the Augusta School Department.
Two disputes during the year caught the public's attention.
In September, the Poulin family of Augusta learned that the route family members had taken for decades to reach their Boothby Street home would no longer be accessible because it crossed the City of Augusta's public works site.
The only other access is up a flight of 100 stairs up a steep hill from Boothby Street.
Monique Poulin said the alternate access was needed because her husband Robert has had back surgeries and her mother Lorraine Piteau has Alzheimer's disease and back and hip problems.
The Poulins filed suit in November to maintain access, and in December, Augusta City Councilors unanimously approved a temporary agreement so the family can continue to drive across city property.
An attorney for the Poulin family said the temporary agreement could be the basis of a longer-term solution if the arrangement works out for both his clients and the city. The lawsuit remains in place and will move ahead unless a settlement is reached.
In a dispute that's ongoing, the partnership that created Central Maine Meats, a slaughterhouse in Gardiner, fell apart.
In April, the company filed for Chapter 12 bankruptcy protection, citing debts to creditors including the Internal Revenue Service, Central Maine Power and the city of Gardiner totaling between $100,000 and $500,000. Chapter 12 is a relatively new chapter, that allows family farmers to avoid liquidation or foreclosure by restructuring finances, but the bankruptcy was converted to a Chapter 7 bankruptcy under which company assets are sold to pay off creditors.
During its nearly three years in operation, the company staked out its territory, offering a local USDA-inspected option for farmers to send their animals to. It was able to secure more than $1 million in state and federal funding for economic development and workforce training.
The company, which was adding on services and functions such as a smoker, flash-freezing and halal butchery, was part of Gardiner's food hub movement and added jobs to the local economy.
In the weeks before the bankruptcy filing, Joel Davis became the sole owner, leaving his former partner Bill Lovely as landlord.
In a separate action, Davis is suing Lovely in the state's Business and Consumer Court, alleging fraudulent dealings.
Both court actions are ongoing.

Texto completo: Our staff picks for the top stories of 2018:
1. University of Maine football reaches the Football Championship Subdivision semifinals
Picked to finish eighth in the Colonial Athletic Association preseason coaches poll, expectations weren't high for the Maine football team. The Black Bears blew up all the doubts, however, making a run to the national final four in the best season in the history of Maine football.
The Black Bears clinched the CAA title with a 27-26 win over Elon in the regular-season finale. After earning the No. 7 seed and a first round bye in the FCS playoffs, Maine was dominant in a 55-27 win over Jacksonville State in a home game in the second round.
The Black Bears went on the road for the quarterfinals, taking a 23-18 win at Weber State. Maine's season ended the following week in a 50-19 loss at Eastern Washington. The Black Bears finished with a 10-4 record. Linebacker Sterling Sheffield and cornerback Manny Patterson, two of the leaders of Maine's Black Hole defense, earned STATS FCS All-America honors.
Days after the season ended, head coach Joe Harasymiak aceepted a job at the University of Minnesota. Offensive coordinator Nick Charlton was promoted to head coach.
2. Amy Vachon's success at women's basketball coach at the University of Maine
An Augusta native, Vachon was named interim head coach of the University of Maine women's basketball team midway through the 2016-17 season. Last season, Vachon coached the Black Bears to an America East Conference title and a trip to the NCAA tournament. Late in the season, the interim tag was removed from Vachon's title.
Maine went 23-10 last season, including a 13-3 record in America East games. The Black Bears defeated Hartford, 74-65, in the conference championship game, before falling to Texas in the first round of the NCAA tournament.
Vachon's Black Bears began the 2018-19 season well, with a 7-4 record in the first 11 games. The start of the 2018-19 season included a win over the University of North Carolina, and 66-63 loss to nationally-ranked Duke.
3. Gardiner field hockey win state title
Gardiner coach Sharon Gallant was concerned about her team's slow starts all season long. But she had no complaints about their strong finishes.
The Tigers continually kicked into gear in the second half during the regular season and did the same in the state championship game, scoring twice over the final 30 minutes to defeat York 3-2 for the Class B title. It was the third overall title for the Tigers.
Jazmin Clary scored in the closing moments of the first half to tie the game at one, then Madelin Walker gave them the lead with a penalty stroke with 15 minutes left to play. Sarah Foust iced the game with an insurance goal to make it 3-1.
The Tigers finished at 17-1-0 behind a strong group of seniors that included Walker, Foust, Aimee Adams, Jillian Bisson, Alyssa Gould and Amanda Cameron. The junior class included forwards Haley Brann and Maggie Bell aloing with Clary while sophomore Lindsey Bell was in goal for the state title run.
4. Monmouth girls win title, then dismiss coach
The Monmouth girls basketball team's year featured dizzying highs, followed by a sudden -- and, as of yet, unexplained -- jolt.
In March, all was right for the Mustangs. Monmouth defended its Class C state title, outlasting rival and fellow Mountain Valley Conference powerhouse Boothbay in the C South final, then thwarting eventual Miss Maine Basketball winner Kolleen Bouchard and Houlton in the state championship game.
"It was in our mind. It was our No. 1 goal," said guard Tia Day, a Miss Maine Basketball semifinalist who hit three first-quarter 3-pointers and scored 14 points in the final. "I think winning it back-to-back made it even more special."
The win became only the first half of the story, however. Coach Scott Wing was dismissed in early November, less than a month before the opening night of the season, and assistants Ray Convery, Dennis Grover and Ed Spencer didn't return either. Rick Larrabee took Wing's place at the helm.
The move made headlines across the state basketball scene, but the school and district have either not responded to or declined requests for comment, and past players who have been reached have been silent on the matter as well.
5. Hall-Dale baseball wins Class C title
They were the favorites before the season began, and then as it went through April and May and approached June. But favorites don't always get the hardware everyone sees coming ahead of time.
The Hall-Dale baseball team, however, was not going to be denied.
The Bulldogs won 19 of 20 games this season, compiling a dream season that ended with the Class C state title, Hall-Dale's first since 2001.
"It was just a season that I think every coach dreams of having," coach Bob Sinclair said. "Where everything comes together."
There was never a doubt Hall-Dale would have the pieces. Every starter was back, and the Bulldogs sported both a balanced lineup led by Austin Stebbins, Akira Warren and Alec Byron and a talented staff headlined by Cole Lockhart and Dean Jackman. Hall-Dale was the Mountain Valley Conference giant, and its players and coaches knew it.
"There was some pressure," Sinclair said, "but we took that pressure and used it to make us better."
Hall-Dale won its first 13 games, then beat Winthrop, Bridgeway and Maranacook en route to the state final. Lockhart, a senior captain, handled it from there, driving in a run and pitching a three-hit, complete game in a 2-1 victory.
"It was a feeling of elation, in that what we had set out to do in March all came to full fruition," Sinclair said. "We had actually accomplished what we set out to (do)."
6. Manch Wheeler dies
The two-way standout for the last of the University of Maine's undefeated football teams, Wheeler died at the age of 79.
Born in Augusta and raised in Manchester, Wheeler attended Phillips Academy before reaching Maine where he stood out at quarterback as well as on defense and special teams. Wheeler threw rarely in coach Harold Westerman's Wing-T offense but led the team in rushing in 1960 and was second in scoring. A year later he was named first-team All-Yankee Conference and led the Black Bears in punting and interceptions as well.
The Black Bears went 8-0-1 in 1961 winning the Yankee Conference title at 5-0. He was inducted into the Maine Sports Hall of Fame in 2013.
Wheeler signed as a free agent with the Buffalo Bills of the American Football League in 1962 and appeared in four games, playing as backup to former All-Pro quarterback Jack Kemp. He later played minor league football in Portland and Hartford.
7. Winthrop field hockey wins Class C crown
After losing in overtime in the Class C state final a year ago, Winthrop coach Jess Merrill and her Ramblers made it their goal to win a title this fall. They accomplished that with a dominating season that ended with a 3-1 victory over Spruce Mountain. The win completed a 17-1 season for the Ramblers who won their first state title since 1989.
Breonna Feeney scored twice for the Ramblers in the final while Gia Francis added a goal. The team lost just two seniors from the previous year and were bolstered by the addition of freshman Maddie Perkins, who led the team in scoring. The rest of the scoring was distributed between a half dozen players and was a product of the team's smooth passing attack.
The Ramblers were particularly strong at midfield led by Mountain Valley Conference player of the year Moriah Hajduk and senior Kate Perkins. The Ramblers will graduate those two along with Feeney, Nora Conrad, Hanna Caprara, Olivia Simonson, Layne Audet and goalie Aiva Agri.
8. Dunking causes controversy in high school basketball tournament
The high school basketball tournament is the sport's biggest stage in Maine, and in 2018, one of the most basic basketball plays became a tournament tempest in a teapot when on court officials at the Augusta Civic Center and Cross Insurance Arena in Portland called technical fouls on players who dunked.
It's Rule 10, Section 4, Article 3. "A player shall not grasp either basket ring at any time during the game except to prevent injury."
According to coaches and players throughout the state, the rule is enforced differently in the regular season than tournament. Under the watchful and critical eye of the Maine Basketball Commission in the tournament, referees are more likely to issue a technical foul on a dunk than in the regular season, those critical of the rule enforcement said.
Peter Webb, the head of the Commission, defended the way the rule was enforced in the playoffs.
"Maine just goes by the rule, and I don't know if other states do or don't. It's not for me to get involved with or to judge the rule. It's not about me anyway. It's about the rules that govern the game," Webb said in a February interview. "We see a lot of dunks going on in the tournament that have been legal. Dunking in and of itself is legal. No rule or official is anti-dunking."
9. Cindy Blodgett gets inducted into Maine Basketball Hall of Fame
Years after compiling a dominant college career, the accolades keep coming for Cindy Blodgett.
This year saw her earn one of the biggest yet.
Blodgett, a Clinton native, was inducted into the Maine Basketball Hall of Fame as part of the 17-member Class of 2018.
The greatest women's basketball player to come from the state, Blodgett led a Lawrence team that ruled Class A in the early and mid 1990s, winning state titles each year from 1991-94. She was no less effective on the Division I stage at the University of Maine, leading the Black Bears to the NCAA tournament each year and finishing her career with 3,005 points -- 13th all-time among D-I players.
Blodgett continued her basketball career as a professional in the WNBA after being drafted sixth overall in 1998, then transitioned to coaching, eventually taking over the women's program at Maine in 2007 and holding the position through the 2010-11 season.
10. UMaine Augusta women's basketball makes national tournament
Star forward Jamie Plummer was gone. There was one senior on the roster. For the UMaine-Augusta women's basketball team, it was supposed to be a rebuilding year.
Instead, it was a season to remember for the Moose. UMA went 21-4 in the regular season, reached the Yankee Small College Conference final and then made the United States Collegiate Athletic Association Division II tournament, its third nationals trip in five years.
"I think it was a surprise that we were as good as we were," said Caitlin LaFountain, a junior forward on the team. "We weren't really expecting (it). ... We realized pretty quickly that we were going to be a special team."
LaFountain was the team's linchpin, averaging 17.5 points and 12.1 rebounds per game, while sophomore Dominique Lewis averaged 14.3 points and freshman Sidney Moore was third at 12.6.
"The way we moved the ball, we all played together like we had been playing together our whole lives," LaFountain said. "It was kind of like 'Wow, we really could do something this year.'"
The Moose beat Southern Maine Community College to reach the YSCC final, where they lost to Central Maine CC. UMA still earned a berth in the USCAA tournament, where it lost to Villa Maria and then Davis.

Texto completo: A group of burglars was plaguing well-to-do homes up and down the Maine coast, stealing silver candlesticks and other heirlooms.
Two of the suspects had been arrested once before and fled the state after posting tens of thousands of dollars for bail. So when they got caught again, the new district attorney in Cumberland County fought for them to remain in custody and persuaded a judge to give them six years in prison for what could have been treated as a petty crime.
When a leader of the group visited her office and tried to cut a deal on restitution, Stephanie Anderson brushed him off.
"We wanted this criminal organization to cease and desist and to consider Maine to be an extremely hostile working environment," Anderson said. "And they have not been back."
It was 1992, and the case hit Anderson's desk during her first term as district attorney, an office she would hold for 28 years overseeing what she estimates to be half a million cases. She would take on cases involving rape, child sex abuse, attempted murder and police misconduct, but she looks back on that burglary case as one of the most important.
It set a tone that Anderson would carry through her tenure in office as a forceful prosecutor who would hold her ground. That career comes to an end Tuesday, when Anderson hands over the reins to a successor she endorsed for the job.
Anderson, who is 66 and lives in Cape Elizabeth, decided not to seek re-election this year after winning seven times in a row, usually without any opposition.
Attorneys who have worked for and with her for nearly three decades described her as a tough lawyer who ushered the state's busiest prosecutorial district into the 21st century. She started the state's first drug court and witnessed criminal justice become more complex with the advent of technology such as police body cameras and social media. She has been the county's top prosecutor as crime decreased but the incarcerated population increased both nationally and in Maine.
"She's been around a long time, but with that has been cutting-edge work," said Michael Sauschuck, a former Portland police chief who was nominated Friday to lead the Maine Department of Public Safety.
Anderson grew up in Eliot, the daughter of a Navy chief petty officer and a waitress. As a young girl in a Catholic family, she first wanted to be a nun and then a ballerina. A strong religious faith would stay with her, but she decided at a young age that she would become an attorney when she read about Clarence Darrow, a famous labor and criminal defense attorney.
She earned a bachelor's degree from the University of Maine in Orono in 1974 and a law degree from the University of Maine School of Law in 1980. She had interned in the Cumberland County District Attorney's Office, but drove to New York City the day after graduating law school and went to work in the district attorney's office in Brooklyn. She worked there for five years, eventually becoming a senior trial attorney in the homicide bureau.
Anderson remembered the head of that office bristling at the idea of a female attorney joining his staff. He told each of his prosecutors to give her one of their cases, saddling her with the files no one wanted. She spent her first day in that office cramming for a trial and peppering the medical examiner with questions about the autopsy report.
"The attorney had told the bureau chief, there's no way she can win this," she said. "I did."
Anderson returned to Maine in 1985 and started her own criminal and civil practice. Other lawyers remembered that her trial experience from Brooklyn gave her an edge in the courtroom.
"She had a reputation as a pretty fearless trial lawyer," defense attorney Tom Hallett said. "Portland is actually a town with a lot of lawyers, and to stand out at all in that crowd is quite difficult, particularly as a young attorney. She did stand out."
A few years later, 37-year-old Anderson decided to go back into prosecuting crimes and launched a run for district attorney as a Republican, promising that she would bring her New York experience to bear, improve efficiency and speed up the prosecution of cases.
Anderson's straight-talking style was obvious from the start of the campaign in 1990. She easily defeated a younger Democratic opponent, David Perkins, once telling voters: "We have different experience. I have it and David does not have it."
On her first day, she found a framed photograph on her new desk in the courthouse. It was a black-and-white picture from the newspaper of the moment she heard the election results -- her head thrown back in celebration and surprise. She won re-election six times -- unopposed in the general every time except in 1998 -- and today she is the lone Republican in an elected office in Cumberland County. That photo was still in her office this month as she spoke about her career.
Anderson quickly streamlined operations, according to officials who praised her at the time as an effective leader who could be both intimidating and charming.
During her tenure, Anderson personally handled several landmark trials.
She prosecuted Warren Cole, a prominent restaurant owner from Gray who was a serial child molester. His crimes were overlooked by law enforcement for years until two victims approached Anderson.
Anderson negotiated an unusual plea agreement in 1992 under which Cole told her all the names of the many boys he had abused and paid $100,000 toward a trust fund for those victims. Later, lawyers said that case made prosecutors more likely to take a child sex abuse case to a jury with the testimony of only one witness.
A decade later, Anderson successfully prosecuted a high-profile rape case involving teenagers at a party in New Gloucester.
The 14-year-old victim in that case had come forward publicly, bringing national interest to the trial. Newspaper clippings from that time described both Anderson and jurors wiping away tears as she made her closing argument and praised the girl for her bravery.
"I give Stephanie Anderson very high grades as a trial attorney," said William Childs, a defense attorney who represented the defendant, Benjamin Cormier. "A very worthy adversary in the courtroom."
In 2008, Anderson prosecuted Robert LaPointe, who ultimately spent time in prison for his role in a fatal boat accident on Long Lake in Harrison.
She won an infamous 2010 trial against Linda Dolloff, a Standish woman who tried to kill her husband and cover up the crime.
She handled a 2013 case against a Falmouth couple whose home was the site of a teenage drinking party. When the jury was deadlocked, the parties negotiated a deal that involved restitution and community service.
The Maine Judicial Branch does not track conviction rates. A fraction of the 10,000 cases that move through the district attorney's office in a given year go to trial. Many of the others result in plea deals, often involving guilty pleas for reduced charges.
Anderson oversees a staff of more than 50 people. That includes 20 attorneys, which Anderson believes is more than double the number when she started in 1991.
"She let you handle your cases the way you thought they should be handled," said Meg Elam, who worked in the Cumberland County District Attorney's Office for nearly three decades before she left for the Maine Attorney General's Office in 2015. "That was a gift to all of us that worked with her, that she trusted our judgment."
Anderson also clashed at times with other leaders in law enforcement, occasionally giving public glimpses of her ability to talk tough and push back.
In 1993, Portland's outspoken police chief, Michael Chitwood, held a news conference with leaders of the Maine NAACP criticizing Anderson for not aggressively pursuing crimes against minorities. Anderson angrily responded with her own press briefing detailing her office's actions on several cases.
"If Chief Chitwood spent as much time acquainting himself with the facts as he does holding press conferences, there would be a lot more peace in Cumberland County," she told news reporters.
She opposed Mark Dion's bid for re-election as Cumberland County sheriff in 2002, saying he lacked character. Dion, a Democrat, won the second term anyway.
"She definitely was a critic, there was no question about that," Dion said. "But it kind of makes you smile, a little bit of smirk, because that's her. That's just how she approaches it." And, he said, it was never personal.
After the election, Anderson called Dion and told him that she wanted to work together with him for the sake of the county, he said. Anderson's style of direct, no-nonsense communication could be off-putting, but came from a place of genuine belief in her positions, Dion said.
"She never seemed to me to be someone who worried about political wind," he said. "She was aware of it, but I think she had integrity in her decision-making."
The current sheriff, Kevin Joyce, credited her with making the criminal justice system more efficient over time, implementing ideas like a unified criminal docket and a bad-check enforcement program.
Sauschuck, who was the Portland police chief from 2012 until earlier this year, praised her open-door policy for officers who disagreed with her charging decisions or who had questions about a case.
Longtime defense attorneys described her as pragmatic and fair, tough but willing to negotiate.
Hallett spoke highly of Anderson and said she will be missed, but also pointed to a recent case as an example of how they disagreed over the years.
He represented a Black Lives Matter protester who was arrested in 2016 after taking part in a demonstration that blocked Commercial Street in Portland to protest police shootings of black men nationwide. When an attempt at a restorative justice meeting failed, the parties traded blame.
"I think as time went on, she became more closed-minded," Hallett said. "That's what I thought I saw in the Black Lives Matter case. I think being a prosecutor for a really long time is hard. Everything becomes a little more black and white. Defense lawyers, we live in a world of gray."
In recent years, Anderson has opposed some new ideas that are being tested in other states, such as eliminating a cash bail system that critics say forces poor people to languish in jail while others do not. But she is also described as an innovator, in particular for her decision to bring drug court to Maine in 1998.
The first drug court started in Florida in 1989. The specialized programs focus on cases that involve alcohol or drug dependency and provide flexibility and support, such as treatment and monitoring.
During her second term, Anderson secured more than $300,000 in federal grant money to start a similar program in Cumberland County. Defense attorney Neale Duffett served on the planning committee for what was called Project Exodus, which Anderson named in a nod to the Old Testament.
"It was well received," Duffett said. "Judges liked it, defense lawyers liked it and prosecutors liked it."
Adult drug treatment courts now operate in five counties in Maine, and the state has created similar court programs for child protective cases and other dockets. The total budget for drug treatment courts in Maine is $2.2 million during this fiscal year, according to a spokeswoman from the Maine Department of Health and Human Services.
But Anderson has long bemoaned a lack of resources allocated to the program, and she even called for its end five years ago during a dispute over the enforcement of probation violations. She argued that the program wouldn't work without a real threat of incarceration.
"If it can't be done right, it shouldn't be done at all," Anderson told the Press Herald in 2013.
Gov. Paul LePage ultimately intervened to stop the drug court from fizzling out. Since then, a probation officer has been dedicated to the county's drug court. Still, Anderson said she has become less convinced over the years that every person who is addicted to drugs is interested in quitting them.
"Yes, we need more treatment," Anderson said. "But ... I question, frankly, how many people want to live a life free from the bondage of addiction."
Kristine Hanly, the defense attorney liaison for all drug court participants, credited Anderson with starting the drug court and fighting for resources.
Hanly also said the court has evolved in recent years with new research on addiction and new treatments, even if the criminal justice system in Maine and across the country still struggles to shake the idea that relapse is a failure rather than a common occurrence on the path to recovery.
"The science just doesn't support that," she said.
Anderson will soon begin a new role as the executive director of the Maine Prosecutors Association.
Meanwhile, her old job will be taken over by the man she endorsed for it, Assistant District Attorney Jonathan Sahrbeck.
An unenrolled candidate, Sahrbeck won by default when the two other candidates in the general election dropped out. Republican Randall Bates withdrew from the race in September, saying the time wasn't right for him. Democrat Jon Gale dropped out just days before the November election because of allegations of sexual misconduct.
Sahrbeck has said he wants to make the role of district attorney more visible in the community, but will continue many of his predecessor's policies once he takes office in January.

Texto completo: Our staff picks for the top stories of 2018:
1. Colby College hockey makes Frozen Four
For the first time in the 95-year history of the program, the Colby College men's hockey team advanced to the NCAA Division III national semifinals in 2018.
The Mules' run to the Frozen Four in Lake Placid, New York was marked with other firsts, too, for a program which began competition in the winter of 1922-23. The team won its first New England Small College Athletic Conference championship by beating Trinity College in the title game and earned its first-ever NCAA tournament game victory with a win at theUniversity of New England in the first round.
Led by senior goaltender Sean Lawrence and national Division III coach of the year Blaise MacDonald, Colby earned the trip to the NCAA semifinals with a win at SUNY-Geneseo in the quarterfinals courtesy of a Justin Grillo goal with 1.6 seconds remaining in regulation. It capped a nine-game unbeaten run for Colby (7-0-2) to reach the Frozen Four.
The Mules finished the season ranked sixth nationally, their highest season-ending ranking ever.
Lawrence finished second in the nation in save percentage (.940) during a season which he went 16-8-2 with a 2.09 goals against average. He was twice selected as the NESCAC player of the week.
MacDonald earned his 300th career coaching victory during the run to the Frozen Four, part of his sixth full season behind the Colby bench.
Colby's historic season ended in a 4-3 loss at the hands of eventual national champion St. Norbert College of Wisconsin in Lake Placid.
2. Nokomis wins Class C football state title
The Nokomis Regional High School football team showed promise in 2017, wining six games under new head coach Jake Rogers and reaching the playoffs for the first tine in program history. In 2018, the Warriors made sure that promise was fufilled with a 13-12 win over Fryeburg Academy in the Class C state chapionship game at Fitzpatrick Stadium in Portland.
Nokomis went 4-4 in the regular season, playing a tough schedule that included games against six playoff teams, including the top seeds in the North and South. In the playoffs, the Warriors used a dominant defense to fight through the regional playoffs. After a 38-6 win over No. 5 Medomak Valley, Nokomis upset top-seed and two-time defending state champ Maine Central Institute, 13-0, in the regional semifinals.
Nokomis continued its defensive resurgence in the regional finals with a 13-6 win over No. 2 Hermon. The Hawks were the highest scoring team in the Big 11 Conference in the regular season, averaging just over 35 points per game.
The state championship game against Fryeburg turned into a defensive battle. With the Raiders holding a 12-7 lead late in the fourth quarter, Tyler Pelletier's 68-yard punt return for a touchdown put the Warriors ahead for good.
The state championship capped the Nokomis football turnaround from a program that went winless in back-to-back seasons in 2015 and 2016.
3. University of Maine football reaches the Football Championship Subdivision semifinals
Picked to finish eighth in the Colonial Athletic Association preseason coaches poll, expectations weren't high for the Maine football team. The Black Bears blew up all the doubts, however, making a run to the national final four in the best season in the history of Maine football.
The Black Bears clinched the CAA title with a 27-26 win over Elon in the regular-season finale. After earning the No. 7 seed and a first round bye in the FCS playoffs, Maine was dominant in a 55-27 win over Jacksonville State in a home game in the second round.
The Black Bears went on the road for the quarterfinals, taking a 23-18 win at Weber State. Maine's season ended the following week in a 50-19 loss at Eastern Washington. The Black Bears finished with a 10-4 record. Linebacker Sterling Sheffield and cornerback Manny Patterson, two of the leaders of Maine's Black Hole defense, earned STATS FCS All-America honors.
Days after the season ended, head coach Joe Harasymiak aceepted a job at the University of Minnesota. Offensive coordinator Nick Charlton was promoted to head coach.
4. Winslow girls basketball wins Class B state championship
They weren't a juggernaut. Far from it.
But in the Class B girls basketball tournament, the Black Raiders of Winslow High School played like one. They faced one higher-seeded team after another and kept finding ways to advance, until the last one had been toppled and there was nothing else to do but celebrate on the Cross Insurance Center floor after winning their first state title since 2005.
"I knew that this team was a great team," senior Haley Ward said after the last victory, a 43-29 decision over Lake Region. "We work hard every single day and we deserve this."
The Black Raiders were seeded a relatively pedestrian sixth in the B North tournament, but carved a swath of upsets through the field in Bangor. North No. 3 MDI went down, as did No. 2 John Bapst. No. 5 Presque Isle was next, giving Winslow the regional title and setting up a showdown with Lake Region, which had upset its own share of foes on the south side.
The Lakers' ride, however, had reached its end. Winslow took the lead for good in the first quarter, then employed shutdown defense to confound Lake Region standouts Chandler True and Lauren Jakobs. Offensively, the Black Raiders got contributions from everyone, both in the starting lineup and off the bench.
An all-around effort led to a fourth-quarter coronation for a championship team few could have pegged before the tournament began.
"The whole team worked so hard," junior Weslee Littlefield said afterward. "We all got into it. This is just an amazing feeling right now."
5. Cindy Blodgett inducted into Maine Basketball Hall of Fame
Years after compiling a dominant college career, the accolades keep coming for Cindy Blodgett.
This year saw her earn one of the biggest yet.
Blodgett, a Clinton native, was inducted into the Maine Basketball Hall of Fame as part of the 17-member Class of 2018.
The greatest women's basketball player to come from the state, Blodgett led a Lawrence team that ruled Class A in the early and mid 1990s, winning state titles each year from 1991-94. She was no less effective on the Division I stage at the University of Maine, leading the Black Bears to the NCAA tournament each year and finishing her career with 3,005 points -- 13th all-time among D-I players.
Blodgett continued her basketball career as a professional in the WNBA after being drafted sixth overall in 1998, then transitioned to coaching, eventually taking over the women's program at Maine in 2007 and holding the position through the 2010-11 season.
6. Dunking causes controversy in high school basketball tournament
The high school basketball tournament is the sport's biggest stage in Maine, and in 2018, one of the most basic basketball plays became a tournament tempest in a teapot when on court officials at the Augusta Civic Center and Cross Insurance Arena in Portland called technical fouls on players who dunked.
It's Rule 10, Section 4, Article 3. "A player shall not grasp either basket ring at any time during the game except to prevent injury."
According to coaches and players throughout the state, the rule is enforced differently in the regular season than tournament. Under the watchful and critical eye of the Maine Basketball Commission in the tournament, referees are more likely to issue a technical foul on a dunk than in the regular season, those critical of the rule enforcement said.
Peter Webb, the head of the Commission, defended the way the rule was enforced in the playoffs.
"Maine just goes by the rule, and I don't know if other states do or don't. It's not for me to get involved with or to judge the rule. It's not about me anyway. It's about the rules that govern the game," Webb said in a February interview. "We see a lot of dunks going on in the tournament that have been legal. Dunking in and of itself is legal. No rule or official is anti-dunking."
7. For the third time in five years, the Madison softball team ended its season as the Class C state champion
The Bulldogs beat Narraguagus 7-3 in the title game at St. Joseph's College in June, capping a perfect 20-0 season which ended with another piece of hardware for the school's trophy case. Sophomore pitcher Lauria LeBlanc pitched a two-hitter with 14 strikeouts against Narraguagus and didn't allow a run after the first inning. Her senior sister, Sydney LeBlanc, clubbed a three-run double in the second inning to give the Bulldogs the lead for good.
For head coach Chris LeBlanc, the victory in the state championship game marked the 100th win of his coaching career.
8. Colby, Thomas and UMaine-Farmington soccer teams make NCAA tournament
It was an excellent fall on the pitch for the area colleges.
The Colby and Thomas men's soccer teams and UMaine-Farmington women's soccer teams all reached the national stage by earning trips to the NCAA tournament. Colby won the New England Small Colleges Athletic Conference title, while Thomas and UMF took home North Atlantic Conference championships.
Colby's berth came automatically after the Mules overcame their status as an eighth seed to win their first conference championship. Colby beat Tufts in penalty kicks, Amherst and then Williams in penalties, 4-3, to take the title.
Colby reached the NCAAs for the first time since 1963, and lost to Montclair State in the first round in penalty kicks.
Thomas beat Husson in the NAC semifinals, then topped SUNY Canton 1-0 for the conference title, the program's fifth. The Terriers fell to Connecticut College 4-0 in their first NCAA tournament game.
UMF beat Northern Vermont-Johnson and Maine-Maritime before upending Thomas 3-1 in the final. Only 5-12 entering the postseason after starting 0-7 and 1-9, the Beavers rallied to earn their second NAC title. Their run came to an end with a 4-1 loss to Middlebury in their first game in the NCAAs.
9. Bobby Wilder inducted into Maine Sports Hall of Fame
In the 1980s, Bobby Wilder made his mark first as a standout quarterback at Madison Area Memorial High School, then at the University of Maine. In recent years, Wilder built the Old Dominion University football team into a Conference USA contender.
In June, Wilder was inducted into the Maine Sports Hall of Fame.
In 10 seasons at Old Dominion, Wilder has a 76-45 record, and coached the Monarchs to victory in the 2016 Popeye's Bahamas Bowl.
Wilder was joined in the Maine Sports Hall of Fame Class of 2018 by Jason Bartlett (harness racing), Dana Bullen (skiing), Reagan Carey (ice hockey), Patrick Dempsey (philanthropist), Dewey DeWitt (broadcaster), Tammy Jacques (cycling), Dick Meader (basketball), Anita Murphy (tennis), Carl Nelson (athletic trainer), LeRoy Patterson (football), and Kristen Kenoyer Woodland (gymnastics).
10. Manch Wheeler dies
The two-way standout for the last of the University of Maine's undefeated football teams, Wheeler died at the age of 79.
Born in Augusta and raised in Manchester, Wheeler attended Phillips Academy before reaching Maine where he stood out at quarterback as well as on defense and special teams. Wheeler threw rarely in coach Harold Westerman's Wing-T offense but led the team in rushing in 1960 and was second in scoring. A year later he was named first-team All-Yankee Conference and led the Black Bears in punting and interceptions as well.
The Black Bears went 8-0-1 in 1961 winning the Yankee Conference title at 5-0. He was inducted into the Maine Sports Hall of Fame in 2013.
Wheeler signed as a free agent with the Buffalo Bills of the American Football League in 1962 and appeared in four games, playing as backup to former All-Pro quarterback Jack Kemp. He later played minor league football in Portland and Hartford.

Texto completo: Maine experienced a dramatic drop-off in reported Lyme disease cases in 2018, and the dry weather this past summer may have played a role.
The state recorded 1,310 Lyme cases through Dec. 27, according to the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention, down from 1,852 in 2017. That represents a 29 percent decrease, although the final number of cases may rise slightly because of a lag in reporting. Lyme is an infectious disease caused by the deer tick, which has expanded its range in Maine over the past 20 years.
Lyme disease cases had climbed every year in Maine since 2011 -- except for 2015 -- before falling off in 2018.
The 1,852 Lyme cases in 2017 represented an all-time high, and the tick-borne illness has persisted in Maine as a public health threat, as there have been more than 1,000 reported cases per year since 2011. Lyme disease can cause flu-like symptoms, swelling, neurological problems like Bell's palsy and joint pain.
Some, but not all, people get a bull's-eye rash where they were bitten by a tick. If caught early, Lyme disease can be treated with antibiotics, but untreated it can cause long-term health problems, especially in the joints and nervous system, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Anaplasmosis, another disease caused by the deer tick, also experienced a sharp decline in 2018, from 663 cases in 2017 to 476 cases through Dec. 27 this year.
Researchers are still learning about what causes fluctuations in deer tick populations and interactions with humans. In addition to Lyme cases being down, there were fewer dead tick submissions to the University of Maine Cooperative Extension, and fewer ticks showing up in field surveys conducted by Maine Medical Center Research Institute staff.
"The big challenge for tick survival may not be the winter, but may be the summer," said Susan Elias, a research associate at the Maine Medical Center Research Institute in Scarborough, which studies the arachnids and Lyme disease.
Rainfall was below average this summer, while high temperatures in July and August were higher than average, according to the National Weather Service in Gray.
Elias said researchers have been examining how the deer tick survives in its southern range, such as Georgia or South Carolina. In the South, the ticks can survive in the hot weather, but they stay below leaf litter and do not seek humans as hosts as frequently, instead preferring low-traveling animals like lizards, she said.
"Ticks are like Goldilocks. It can't be too hot or too cold or too dry. It has to be just right," Elias said. "But they are experts at finding the right microclimate for them, so if it's too hot and dry, for instance, they will retreat under the leaf litter."
Still, if the weather is hot and dry enough for an extended period, that could lead to reduced tick populations, researchers say.
Researchers will be comparing Maine's dry summer of 2016 with this year's summer, looking at humidity and temperature patterns, to see if there's any correlation with tick activity. In 2016, Lyme cases were down in the summer but came back stronger in the fall, and Maine ended up with 1,464 cases that year.
This year, Lyme cases started strong in the spring and early summer but fell off in the late summer, compared to previous years, and did not rebound in the fall, like they did in 2016.
Extreme cold temperatures without snow can also kill ticks, but the temperatures have to be consistently below or near 0 degrees Fahrenheit for weeks before researchers believe tick populations would be significantly affected. Snow acts as an insulator and helps ticks survive the winter.
Griffin Dill, integrated pest management professional at the University of Maine Cooperative Extension, said it's difficult to tell whether 2017 was an aberration or whether 2018 represents a one-year drop-off before Lyme cases climb again.
Dill said there were 20 percent fewer tick identification submissions to the University of Maine's "tick lab" this year, with a steeper decline in the fall. People who are bitten by ticks can submit them to the lab for identification.
"Fall is usually a very active time for ticks, but not this year," Dill said. "There also may not have been as many opportunities for tick-human interactions."
Dill said the snow and colder temperatures that arrived in November probably reduced tick activity at a time when people were still outside. For instance, hunters may have come across fewer active ticks.
"In those conditions, there's not going to be a lot of tick activity," he said.
Researchers are also studying how Lyme may correlate with the rodent population. Maine had an abundance of squirrels in 2018, probably caused by a higher-than-normal acorn crop in 2017. The theory is that the increased rodent population this year will result in more ticks next year, but Dill said he's skeptical of that, and more research is needed.

There's a huge and hidden migration in North America - of dragonflies

Texto completo: Each spring and fall, large dragonflies called green darners fly across North America. A green darner can travel as far as 900 miles on its two-inch wings, fluttering from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico. They are some of the most abundant dragonflies on the continent - but few people notice this mass migration.
Unlike monarch butterflies and songbirds, whose long-distance migrations draw crowds, green darners are inconspicuous travelers. These dragonflies rarely migrate in huge swarms. Radiant up close - emerald green at the thorax, splashes of blue on the abdomen - a three-inch-long dragonfly becomes a speck at a hundred yards. Even dragonfly experts have had little luck observing this cross-continental journey. In one study, published in 2006, a research team in New Jersey glued tiny radio transmitters to 14 green darners; the scientists shadowed the insects by Cessna but could follow them for only about 80 miles from the scientists' base at Princeton University.
Research published this week in Biology Letters is the first to describe dragonfly migration in detail. The authors did not bother with tracking live insects. Instead, they extracted chemicals from dragonfly wings that link an animal to its birthplace. Using 850 wing samples, from museums and private collections in the United States, Canada, Mexico and five Caribbean countries, the scientists constructed 140 years of dragonfly migratory history.
Colin Studds, an animal ecologist at the University of Maryland Baltimore County and an author of this study, tracked bird migration by chemical signature. This technique exploits a property of the element hydrogen. In nature, hydrogen comes in three forms, called isotopes, with different numbers of neutrons. The International Atomic Energy Agency began tracking hydrogen and oxygen isotopes in the 1950s while looking for nuclear contamination in rain. In the 1980s, biologists realized they could use this isotope data to their own ends.
Heavier forms of hydrogen concentrate more densely in the water in Southern states, where warmer weather leads to more evaporation. Dragonflies, which live in ponds as wriggling larvae, absorb the native isotopes of hydrogen and incorporate them into their chitin. That's the stuff that, when larvae grow into adults, makes up their wings.
The ratio of hydrogen isotopes revealed the approximate location of the dragonflies' birth ponds. It's not a super precise tracking system, Studds said, but it's enough to tell whether a dragonfly was born in Florida, Maryland or Maine. A dragonfly caught in northern latitudes might look like a local bug, but its wing isotopes reveal whether it is a migrant.
A multigenerational scene emerged from this data. "We've got three generations, one north, one south and one that's only hanging out in Florida," Studds said.
In the early spring, the first generations exit the shelter of their Southern ponds and fly north, an average of 400 miles on the wing. There they lay their eggs and die. The second generation hatches in the north and, by September, has flown south. There they lay eggs and die, too. Because the South is the most comfortable place for a dragonfly late in the year, the third generation won't migrate at all. They settle in for winter in Florida or the Caribbean. Life is good - until spring rolls around, when the cycle of eggs, death, birth repeats.
The new research "is a really good bit," said Michael May, a dragonfly expert at Rutgers University who was not a member of this research team. "We had a general idea of what was going on," he said, but until now there was no way to follow the course of the whole migration. (The Cessna approach, flown by one of May's collaborators, can't cover enough territory.)
Dragonflies fly the routes that their great-grandparents, long-deceased, once did. They do so without any communication passed from older generations. So how do they know where and when to go? Studds could not say for sure, but he had a few ideas, considering the environmental cues that trigger bird migration.
Dragonflies are sensitive to temperature. Data from citizen scientists, who recorded the first adults of the season, suggest that green darners do not leave the safety of their ponds until temperatures reach 48 degrees. Perhaps there's another temperature signal for them to migrate. If so, "climate warming could really disrupt the presence of this migration," Studds said. The insects might also migrate based on changes in the amount of daylight in a day.
May has seen a migrating swarm of green darners only once in his 40-plus-year career as an entomologist. On a barrier island in St. Augustine, Fla., the insects streamed over dunes and surf, as rapidly as 100 a minute. They came for three days, mostly in the morning, in a band a half-mile wide. He estimates 500,000 flew by.
"They are pretty amazing creatures," May said. He paused. "You could say that about any creature," he said, with just a touch less conviction.

Texto completo: PISCATAWAY - Steve Pikiell has been telling his Rutgers basketball team for weeks: Attack the basket.
It finally happened in the second half Saturday, allowing the Scarlet Knights to get past lowly Maine 70-55 before a crowd of 4,500 at the RAC.
After falling behind by 10 while misfiring from the outside, Rutgers rallied thanks to key contributions off the bench from redshirt freshmen center Myles Johnson (10 points, 10 rebounds) and freshman guard Caleb McConnell (14 points, 3 assists).
So the Scarlet Knights (7-5 overall, 0-2 Big Ten) finished their non-conference slate with a 7-3 mark.
"I like my team a lot," Pikiell said. "There's a lot of figuring things out, especially when you have six guys who have never played here at Rutgers before in your 10 (man rotation). Can we be more consistent? Obviously we're going to have to be in the Big Ten. It's the best league in the country. Can we move in that direction? That's going to be the next big thing."
Here are five takeaways on where this young team is at before Maryland's visit Jan. 5.
5 nonconference takeaways
1. About what we thought
In the preseason, any reasonable observer could have pegged Rutgers to go 7-3 against the nonconference slate and 7-5 overall to this point. The Scarlet Knights coughed up one bad loss (Fordham) and notched one upset win (Miami). So nothing real surprising there.
The team's record always was going to take a step back this season, with Corey Sanders leaving and the schedule toughening.
What's a bit concerning is Rutgers has played down to weaker competition over the last few weeks after rolling by those teams early. There are going to be ups and downs with a group this young, but with 18 straight Big Ten games staring them in the face, they have to cut out these 8-10 minute lapses we've been seeing.
"We can't play the first half bad and just think we're going to pick it up in the second half," Johnson said.
"Going into Big Ten play, we've all got to step it up another level," McConnell said. "We have 18 tougher games coming up."
2. Shot selection is poor
Pikiell wants his guys to be more judicious from deep. Rutgers entered Saturday hitting 3-pointers at a rate of .319, which ranks next-to-last in the Big Ten. They were taking 22 per game before launching 30 against Maine's zone (and making just eight).
The league's worst-shooting team, Minnesota (.314), averages a more reasonable 17 attempts and has a 10-2 record with a win over Nebraska. The league's best-shooting team, Wisconsin (.400), averages 20. So the Scarlet Knights are way out of whack there.
Pikiell wants his players driving. Geo Baker and Pete Kiss have taken just 45 free throws between them this season. That's fewer than four per game from the starting backcourt — an unacceptable number.
Following the coach's instructions could help Rutgers improve on a .410 field-goal percentage and average scoring output of 69 points, both worst in the conference.
3. Baker needs help
The sophomore is averaging 34 minutes per game, which is tied for second in the Big Ten (with Maryland's Anthony Cowan and behind Penn State's Lamar Stevens).
His shooting numbers over the last four games hint at someone who's hit a wall: 4-14, 4-16, 5-16 and 3-11 from the floor (total: 16 of 57, or 28 percent).
Baker is best suited to play off the ball, and Pikiell is trying to remove some of the burden by playing him alongside McConnell. It worked well in the second half against Maine.
"I feel like Geo plays well off the ball, so me coming in and playing point guard, giving him a break for a few possessions, it works for him and the team," McConnell said. "I feel like the offense flows better."
Pikiell agrees.
"Caleb's come a long way. I'm real proud of his development," the coach said. "We're going to keep playing that lineup as long as those guys keep playing and practicing well. It's a good lineup for us."
It doesn't help Baker that Rutgers gets little scoring from the wing position. It's been a struggle on the offensive end for junior Issa Thiam.
4. More offense needed from the freshmen
You'd like to be able to bring freshmen along slowly, on a natural learning curve, but Rutgers can't afford it.
Montez Mathis, Ron Harper Jr. and McConnell have exhibited promising flashes, but they need to be more consistent and know their strengths. Harper is shooting 5-of-36 from 3-point range. Mathis is shooting 3-of-20. No way that's part of Pikiell's plan.
If you want to lump redshirt freshman Johnson in with the newcomers, he's been the most consistent of the group.
"I loved him today," Pikiell said. "Loved the fact that he had six offensive rebounds. Love the fact that he finished. He's got to continue to do that obviously with the league we play in. He gave us great poise in the middle of their zone."
Johnson also displayed grit, getting four stitches at halftime after taking an elbow above his left eye.
"The stitches made him a little tougher," Baker said with a chuckle. "That's the presence we need inside."
Rutgers needs it desperately. Too much of the interior offense has rested on junior forward Eugene Omoruyi, who will be undersized against Big Ten power forwards.
"In the first few games I wanted to do everything perfect," Johnson said of his development. "Now I tell myself, 'You've just got to keep playing.'"
5. Still playing hard
The main positive from the 2018 portion of Rutgers' schedule is the Scarlet Knights continue to do the effort stuff well. They rank fifth in the Big Ten in rebounding margin and third in offensive boards. Their defense is not quite as efficient as last year (Sanders' on-ball presence is missed), but it's still reasonably good. Everyone in this deep rotation seems to be buying into their roles.
"We're young but I think we've learned a lot," Baker said. "We're a lot tougher now."
So the culture Pikiell and his staff have worked to instill remains in place as the new guys figure things out. The program will need it over the next 18 games.

Resumen: FARMINGTON — Probate Judge Richard Morton is hanging up his well-worn black robe — ripped inside sleeves and all — on Dec. 31 after 35 years on the Franklin County bench.

Texto completo: FARMINGTON — Probate Judge Richard Morton is hanging up his well-worn black robe — ripped inside sleeves and all — on Dec. 31 after 35 years on the Franklin County bench.
“I just love the work,” he said. “I am retiring because I have done it for a long time and other people should have the opportunity to experience the same professional satisfaction that I have.”
Morton, 70, wants to experience all of the aspects of retired living while he has the time, health and enthusiasm for new activities.
“There are just a lot of things available to do if you are not tied to a court schedule,” he said.
The Farmington native became a lawyer in 1973 and has served as a military lawyer in the U.S. Army’s Judge Advocate General Corps and in the Maine National Guard. He has assisted legislative Republican leaders and has been a prosecutor for the state.
His high school civics teacher, the late Bob Stevens, put the idea in his head to pursue a career as a lawyer.
“From that point on, I focused on what I was going to be,” Morton said.
He opened a private law practice in downtown Farmington in space that Benjamin Butler offered in his office for $50 a month in the fall of 1978.
Morton considers himself fortunate that the lawyers in Farmington were “extremely generous” in giving advice and referring work to him.
“And because I grew up in Farmington and was the new guy on the block, some people wanted a different lawyer,” he said.
Maine Probate Law changed in 1981 and Morton was in the thick of it. The initial probate law had evolved over 150 years and was kind of pieced together and a little disorganized, he said.
He had worked as a legal aide for the Republican leaders in the Legislature from 1979 to 198o. Because of his work there, he was able to observe, participate and attend all of the judicial meetings.
“I had a front-row seat to the change, which meant everybody was learning it for the first time,” he said.
When a probate judge in Franklin County resigned, the Republicans caucused and put his name forward to fill the position. Gov. Joseph Brennan appointed Michael Gentile to the position. Two years later, when the election was held, Morton was elected.
He started serving his term in 1983 and even though he had experience, he found it a challenge to learn all aspects of probate law.
However, when the law changed, a code was developed and he followed it.
“We all learned it together,” he said. “I just found that I loved it. I loved the interaction with the people.”
In many cases, people represented themselves instead of hiring a lawyer.
“I enjoyed the finality of it. The fact I had a case to decide, a decision was made and you moved on,” Morton said.
Being a probate judge was a nice variation in his overall career.
He said two categories of cases are the most difficult. One is cases involving children whose parents are unable to care for them and a guardian is appointed. Then the parents want the guardianship terminated and contest the guardianship.
“Those are very difficult,” he said.
Other cases he finds difficult are when people are disabled, have dementia or other issues of incapacity, and not only who should care for them but how much independence they should retain needs to be figured out, he said.
“Some of the most satisfying cases are decedents’ estate disputes when the family just can’t agree on how to complete their parents’ estate and the court then essentially solves their problems,” Morton said.
During his tenure on the bench, he has handled more than 9,000 cases and of those, perhaps 10 percent were contested.
“I have been supported in an extraordinary way both by the staff of probate court and my staff at my private practice office, allowing me to do this work in an organized and effective manner,” he said.
He closed his private practice on June 14, 2013. Morton’s wife, Joyce Morton, has worked in the probate office for nearly 50 years and has been registrar of probate since 1983.
“I will miss the interaction with the people of Franklin County and the lawyers in Franklin County who have made this job such a pleasure,” Richard Morton said.
New Judge of Probate Margot Joly of Weld will take office on Jan. 1, 2019.

Texto completo: HEBRON — Nearly a year after she was diagnosed with lung cancer, Amy Richard said she is “hanging in there.”
“I’m not as strong as I was. I’ve lost some weight,” she said. “But my scans have been stable, so that’s good news. And I’m getting into some advocacy work.”
Richard, 42, is a wife, mother of two young children and a nurse who works with lung cancer patients. She was diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer, caused by a genetic mutation, last January.
A story about her plight and the support she received from the community appeared in the Sun Journal in March.
Since then, Richard has continued to use a new gene-targeting therapy she battled her health insurance company over. Physically, she’s very tired, in a lot of pain, not sleeping well.
“Not a fun ride,” Richard said. “I think a lot of it is just the exertion from breathing. It takes a lot out of me.”
A nurse at Central Maine Cardiothoracic and Vascular Surgery in Lewiston, she’s working part time. Her husband, Chris, has taken over a lot of household duties because she can’t do it.
But Richard has participated in a public service announcement to raise awareness about radon, a naturally occurring radioactive gas that can cause lung cancer. She’s started alternative therapies, such as acupuncture and reiki, and has changed her diet. Her condition is stable.
In the year since her diagnosis, friends, family and community members have continued to rally around her. After the Celebration of Courage Co-ed Hockey Tournament was held in her honor in March, two additional fundraisers were held for her — a golf tournament and a softball tournament.
She’s used the proceeds to pay for medical bills, alternative therapies not covered by insurance and a chiropractor for her back spasms
Her co-workers adopt a family every Christmas. This year, they adopted hers, complete with gifts for her 7-year-old daughter and 3-year-old son.
“My co-workers are amazing,” she said. “I swear, it was like a Hallmark Christmas movie.”
It’s been, she said, “overwhelming in a good way.”
“I cannot believe all the support from everybody in the community,” she said.
That support has gone beyond money, and she’s grateful for that, too.
“I just want to say a huge thank you to everyone who’s sent me messages just to check in. . . . Someone reaching out and saying, ‘How are you doing? How are you really doing?’” she said. “Because I was in denial, I think, for a good many months about this. This fall it hit me that this is really happening. It’s been hard. It’s been kind of a rough fall. I think it would have been a lot tougher if I didn’t have the support of everybody: family, friends, co-workers, strangers, people I don’t even know.”

Texto completo: ‘This I’ll Defend:’ Boys fall into Androscoggin River
Horror and heroics occurred on the Androscoggin River in April as two boys fell into the water and got swept away by the rampaging current.
LOOKING BACK ON 2018

It happened in the early evening of April 24 near Bonney Park in Auburn where 5-year-old Valerio McFarland was playing with his 10-year-old brother at the river’s edge. When Valerio fell into the river, his brother Maxim was the first to jump in to try to save him, according to the family.
Rescuers were able to pull Maxim from the water, but Valerio was not seen again until May 15, when his body was recovered about 5 miles downriver.
The horror of the drowning was followed by a massive outpouring of grief and support by the people of Lewiston-Auburn and from others around the country. Vigils were held in Bonney Park and along the walking bridge that spans the river. Hundreds of people showed up to support the McFarland family, who had moved to the area just days before the drowning. On and around the walking trestle, waves of mourning strangers left teddy bears, balloons, candles, flowers, toy dinosaurs — Valerio’s favorite — and personal messages in honor of the drowned boy.
The family motto, “This I’ll Defend,” caught on quickly and began to appear on T-shirts, balloons and other items.
Maxim McFarland survived the trauma and would later join his parents in Bonney Park as the family addressed the kindness of those who had supported them. Jason and Helena Gagliano McFarland have become advocates of making Bonney Park safer for those who play near the river that snatched their sons.
Maxim also met with the rescuers who had saved him, including an off-duty firefighter who rushed into the river immediately upon hearing that a pair of children had fallen in. Those rescuers, as humble heroes often do, have consistently declined to be interviewed about their quick actions that saved a boy’s life.
‘A life lost too soon:’ Lewiston Middle School student drowns during field trip
On a bright, warm June day meant to offer middle-schoolers some fun and bonding away from school, 13-year-old Rayan Issa disappear in the calm waters of Range Pond in Poland.
When a student reported Issa missing, a search began that would ultimately end with the discovery of the boy’s drowning. The seventh-grader was on a field trip with other Lewiston Middle School students to Range Pond State Park.
The drowning stunned the community, with many struggling to understand how a student could perish in the pond while surrounded by more than 100 classmates, a dozen school chaperones and a lifeguard.
Issa would remain underwater for half an hour before his rescuers found his body still within the buoyed swimming area. An investigation would reveal that Issa, who had ventured into deep water in pursuit of a football, did not know how to swim. Yet the community remained saddened and mystified by the drowning, and school officials ordered a full investigation into the cause of the June 12 tragedy.
Vigils were held for Issa, whom friends described as funny and comforting and always kind. Meanwhile, at the end of June, an investigative report was released to the public, detailing the circumstances around the drowning.
The report’s preliminary conclusion was that the Lewiston public school system should change its policies and establish specific standards for field trips that involve water activities. Superintendent Bill Webster has said field trips, including the upcoming summer program outings that begin July 2, will not allow swimming because it is unclear which students know how to swim.
Awaiting justice: Man dies after downtown Lewiston brawl
In the wee hours of June 12, two groups of people clashed near Lewiston’s Kennedy Park. By the time the skirmish was over, 38-year-old Donald Giusti lay on the ground, unconscious and badly hurt.
Giusti died at a hospital three days later, and tensions in downtown Lewiston went from bad to worse.
Although details of the fight would remain murky, one fact appeared to be beyond dispute: The brawl was the result of ongoing tensions between groups of mostly young men, many of whom frequented Kennedy Park.
In the days that followed, Giusti was mourned, but there were also loud demands for justice in the attack that claimed his life. As vigils formed and the war of words escalated, no arrests were made and the wait for justice would prove long. By the end of the year, Maine State Police had still not charged anyone in the assault some witnesses insist was racially motivated.
While the community buzzed with anger and grief, police released sporadic updates on the case and urged patience.
In mid-August, Lt. Mark Holmquist of the Maine State Police Major Crimes Unit told the City Council that the pace of the investigation had slowed as investigators analyzed evidence that had been gathered and evidence that had been sent out for testing.
Investigators were analyzing video footage of the brawl from city cameras and from witnesses who had recorded the fight. Police said the complexity of the case, with a number of juveniles and teenagers involved, made a quick resolution unlikely.
While Giusti’s death was investigated, some feared a wave of violence would engulf Kennedy Park and surrounding areas. That didn’t happen, in large part because the bulk of Giusti’s family made repeated calls for patience and calm while the police sorted out the case. Community efforts by concerned citizens to increase communication and understanding among all groups also helped.
“Donny wouldn’t want any more of his friends getting hurt,” said Nick Vinciguerra, a friend of Giusti’s. “We need to stop the violence. We need to end this cycle today.”
The family’s appeals helped inspire patience in some, although as weeks and months passed without resolution, some of that patience began to wear thin.
“We have listened to the same song and dance for months,” Giusti’s brother, Brian Veres, said in November. “Justice needs to be served.”
Woman stabbed to death on Lewiston sidewalk
Shortly before noon on Sunday, July 15, a 48-year-old mother of two was stabbed to death on a sidewalk in front of a Lewiston laundromat.
As more details emerged in the killing of Kimberly Dobbie on Sabattus Street, the horror of the crime grew.
Dobbie, who lived in a Lewiston homeless shelter, was knifed to death in front of her 11-year-old twins by a 76-year-old convicted murderer who had become obsessed with her.
Police said Dobbie had just stepped out of Rancourt’s Laundromat with her two boys when she was attacked and stabbed by Albert Flick, who had been convicted in 1979 of stabbing his wife to death.
Flick was tackled by bystanders at the scene and held until police arrived. But the injuries Dobbie had suffered proved to be fatal, and she died a short time later a block away at Central Maine Medical Center.
The killing baffled and saddened Dobbie’s friends as well as dozens of strangers who turned out to a candlelight vigil to honor her. According to those who knew her, Dobbie, a former school teacher, had been just days from moving out of Hope Haven Gospel Mission and into an apartment in Jay.
It was also revealed that Dobbie had been growing increasingly wary of Flick, a casual friend who had begun to harass and stalk her.
Flick, who in addition to the murder conviction has a more recent history of assaults and domestic violence, remains jailed and awaiting trial.
Bogus Craigslist ad leads to wholesale looting in Greene
In October, 71-year-old George Stanley was away in Florida when he learned that an ad had been placed announcing that all of the items on his Greene property were up for grabs.
“Free!” the Craigslist ad read. “Come one, come all, everything on the lot is free!”
The ad was bogus, but it looked real enough that people began to show up at all hours to fill their cars, trucks and box vans full of Stanley’s property.
Before Stanley could scramble back from Florida, a multitude of items were taken in round-the-clock looting frenzies on his Route 202 property.
Dozens of people showed up for free goods, breaking down doors, busting locks and hauling away anything that seemed to be of value.
A pallet of roofing shingles, power tools, hand tools, generators, hand-made items and a variety of other things Stanley had collected in his years of living at the site.
Someone even climbed to the roof of the building and removed the iconic green alien, constructed of wood, that had hung there for a decade. The head of the alien was ripped off. Scavengers made off with a 4- by 8-foot, wood-constructed Paul Bunyan, although they left behind Babe, a wooden blue ox.
The looters took stuff of value and left behind trash, Stanley said, including dirty diapers, feminine products and cigarette butts stamped out on Stanley’s dishware.
Stanley ultimately made his way back from Florida and assessed his losses at more than $10,000. The public reaction to the wholesale scavenging of his property, meanwhile, was mixed: Some scoffed that since Stanley’s sprawling heaps of clutter presented an eyesore, the looting was almost karmic justice. Others insisted that theft is theft and they demanded an investigation.
Maine State Police are investigating the matter, although by the end of the year, no one had been charged and it remained unclear who had created the bogus ad.
Stanley has since put out appeals for people to simply bring back the items they had hauled away from his lot. Only a trickle of items has been returned and Stanley said he had no faith that the people who rummaged his property would be inspired to do the right thing.
“Nope,” Stanley said. “I have no faith in human nature.”
More than a dozen charged in massive pot raids
A massive police operation in February targeted nearly two dozen homes and business in Lewiston-Auburn as investigators cracked down on what they say was an illegal marijuana growing ring.
By the time the dust settled, the numbers associated with the case were staggering. More than a dozen people were charged in a 41-count federal indictment, accused of participating in a drug ring that netted them six figures.
The aim of the raids, investigators said, was to bust a medical marijuana-growing operation that illegally sold surplus pot and derivatives, according to police and federal drug agents.
Prosecutors alleged the drug-trafficking organization grew and distributed large amounts of marijuana under the cover of Maine’s medical marijuana program, but it sold marijuana to buyers who were not participants in the program and included out-of-state customers.
The owners of five businesses in the Twin Cities were indicted for having places where marijuana distributing and manufacturing took place, some dating back to 2015.
As the case against the suspects moves through the federal court system, prosecutors are seeking forfeiture of more than $300,000 in seized cash, eight men’s watches, a $37,000 diamond ring, about $750,000 held in escrow or in bank accounts and five pieces of real estate, including three in Lewiston and one in Auburn.
Democrats take control
Election Day 2018 turned out to be a good time for Democrats as the party gained control of the Maine Legislature, increased their majority in the House of Representatives and recaptured a decisive majority in the Senate.
Democrat Janet Mills was elected governor, scoring a victory over Republican Shawn Moody to secure the Blaine House.
Maine’s first use of ranked-choice balloting predictably proved controversial after Democrat Jared Golden eked out a tight victory over Republican Bruce Poliquin for Congress.
It wasn’t until nine days after Election Day, though, that Golden was declared the winner of Maine’s 2nd Congressional District race. Secretary of State Matthew Dunlap announced Golden had won by a little less than 3,000 votes out of more than 283,000 cast — a margin large enough to make a recount questionable. He grabbed the top spot because 69 percent of the second-choice ballots that ranked the candidates picked him over the two-term lawmaker.
It wasn’t until a month later that Poliquin accepted the results of the election. With two courts ruling against him, he announced on Christmas Eve that he would no longer dispute Golden’s victory, although Poliquin continued to assert that Maine’s ranked-choice system — adopted by Maine voters in a referendum in 2016 and affirmed in another referendum vote in June — is unconstitutional and illegal. It was a contention with which he couldn’t get a court to agree.
The Democrats’ victories mark the first time in eight years that one party has gained control of the entire Legislature and the governorship with the historic win by Mills, the state’s only female governor.
Party leaders said they would use their majority to take action on several key issues, including funding Medicaid expansion, keeping $160 million in school funding in place and addressing the opioid crisis, as well as workforce development, student debt relief and promotion of renewable energy.
Online comments derail Sabattus candidate
In March, feisty Republican Leslie Gibson had been coasting toward an unopposed election in the 57th district when online comments he made about a Florida school shooting proved his undoing.
The candidate for the Maine House of Representatives from Sabattus called one student from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., “a skinhead lesbian” and another “a bald-faced liar.”
The comments were made in reference to a pair of students who became activists in the wake of the Feb. 14 shooting in Parkland.
Reaction to Gibson’s comments was immediate. Local politicians, both Democrat and Republican, denounced Gibson’s comments. Two local Democrats, Thomas Martin and Eryn Gilchrist, were stirred to action, with each filing paperwork in Augusta to oppose Gibson in the race. But they wouldn’t be facing off against Gibson after all: Just days after his online comments came to light, Gibson announced that he was abandoning his efforts to win a State House seat.
“I am not walking away with my head hung low,” he said while making the March 17 announcement. “I am walking away with my head held high.”
Martin would end up winning the District 57 seat.
Beleaguered Auburn lawyer makes bid for District Attorney’s Office
What a year it was for Auburn lawyer Seth Carey.
In June, the 43-year-old won a GOP primary in the race for district attorney for Androscoggin, Franklin and Oxford counties with one intriguing twist — as he made his bid for the prosecutor’s office, Carey was actively barred from practicing law.
Throughout the year, Carey managed to rally support, in spite of the fact that his license to practice law had been suspended since spring. He faced the possibility of getting tossed out of the legal profession because of findings of sexual assault and witness tampering.
As he made his run for the DA’s office, Carey had protection-from-abuse orders issued against him, including one in which a judge found Carey engaged in three unwanted sexual advances on a woman he invited to live in a spare room at his Rumford home.
Carey remained embattled throughout the year, but it never seemed to slow his bid for the right to prosecute cases in Androscoggin, Oxford and Franklin counties.
In September, Superior Court Justice Thomas Warren ruled in an 18-page order that Carey had violated several bar rules, including unlawful conduct stemming from his unwanted sexual advances involving a woman who lived at his Rumford home and his effort to pay for her silence on the matter. Carey also had engaged in law practice and wrote checks on his professional account despite his April suspension, which prohibited those actions.
Still, the run for the District Attorney’s Office went on. As Election Day drew nearer, ardent supporters took to making handmade campaign signs and posting them across the tri-county area.
On Election Day, Carey garnered enough votes to make it interesting and even won some municipalities, including Lisbon and Mechanic Falls. In the end, though, incumbent Andrew Robinson won by a wide margin and retained the office.
On Dec. 20, Justice Warren ordered that instead of disbarment, as sought by the Maine Board of Bar Overseers, Carey’s right to practice law would be suspended for three years. Carey’s attorney, James Howaniec, said in a statement this past Wednesday that he and Carey are assessing whether to file an appeal with the Maine Supreme Judicial Court.
What’s for dinner? The changing face of local dining
Diners reacted with stomach-rumbling grief throughout the year as a series of popular restaurants closed their doors for good.
In July, managers of the popular downtown lunch and dinner spot Marche Kitchen & Wine Bar in Lewiston announced they were closing. Just over a month later, the grim news that Fuel, known for its exquisite food and occasional celebrity diners, would follow suit. Both restaurants were at one time owned by Eric Agren, who helped stir a revitalization of lower Lisbon Street when he opened Fuel 11 years ago.
Around the same time the Fuel and Marche era came to an end, it was revealed that Rails restaurant on Lincoln Street would serve its last meal. Owner Ileshea Stowe explained that staffing had become an issue at the restaurant, a problem that had been vexing bars and restaurants around the state.
Times were tough for locals who like to eat out and eat well. In Auburn, Rolandeau’s had closed in May after nearly five decades of feeding customers prime rib, escargot and beef Wellington.
It wasn’t just Lewiston-Auburn. In Rumford, employees of the River Valley Grill restaurant on Route 2 were greeted on a May morning with a sign on the door that read: “This restaurant is now closed! Had enough of the bull—!! (sorry).”
Restaurants seemed to be shutting down all over the place, but as is often the case, for every business that closed its doors, something new fell in to take its place. Across the region, a whole bunch of new restaurants are in the works.
One of the owners of the popular Cowbell Burger Bar in Biddeford said he will open Cowbell Grill & Tap in the former Fuel restaurant. It features 25 burgers, 25 mostly Maine craft brew taps and, Alex Markakis said, a few menu items he hopes reminds people of the Fuel days.
In June, business partners Ben Low and Matt Johannes announced that Side By Each Brewing Co. and The Poutine Factory would open at 1110 Minot Ave. in Auburn this coming winter. Low is the former director of brewing operations at Baxter Brewing and Johannes is the former head brewer there.
Pizza fans rejoiced in the spring when it was announced that Lewiston would be getting a Portland Pie Co. The pizza shop and pub has plans to move into the shuttered Lincoln Street firehouse that a pair of local developers saved from demolition last year.
Buffet? Lewiston’s getting that, too, and possibly as soon as January. In early December, Dave Paine of Lewiston announced he is opening a 275-seat restaurant, Dave’s American Buffet, in the Lewiston Mall. His buffet will be an ever-changing mix of American comfort food: think mac and cheese, baked haddock, grilled chicken, country mashed potatoes.
Just up the road, at 265 Lisbon St., the Heritage Restaurant has already opened and is serving a mix of American, Somali and other African dishes that include smoothies, teas, goat and camel meats.
In Auburn, Mike and Heather Greenlaw opened Mike’s Runway Diner on Aug. 1 at the Auburn-Lewiston Municipal Airport, revamping the menu from barbecue-centric to diner comfort food.
In Lisbon Falls, a pair of brothers opened Flux Restaurant on Main Street, featuring a lunch and dinner menu with starters such as poutine and tempura cauliflower, and main dishes such as buttermilk fried chicken, gnocchi and the Flux burger with beef, sauerkraut, caramelized onion and remoulade, a French-inspired condiment.
Back in Lewiston, the city’s newest bar, Sonder & Dram, opened in June at 12 Ash St. The bar offers craft beer, cocktails and a few menu items, including an Elvis-inspired sandwich.

Resumen: POWNAL — At his last post, in the Allagash Wilderness Waterway, Caribou native Chris Silsbee had a four-hour commute to work, left his family for nine days at a time to live in the woods and might see more deer than people on any given day. Two years ago, deciding his family was ready for a change, they moved the farthest south they’ve ever lived, to Bradbury Mountain State Park. Silsbee, who is also manager of Mackworth Island State Park outside of Falmouth, said his family has settled in nicely to the house provided inside the park.

Texto completo: POWNAL — At his last post, in the Allagash Wilderness Waterway, Caribou native Chris Silsbee had a four-hour commute to work, left his family for nine days at a time to live in the woods and might see more deer than people on any given day.
Two years ago, deciding his family was ready for a change, they moved the farthest south they’ve ever lived, to Bradbury Mountain State Park.
“Depending on the time of year up on the Allagash, it could be days before I’d see somebody,” said Silsbee, 41. “Being so close to a high-populated areas down here, Bradbury is kind of nice because it’s so close to everything, yet once you’re here, you kind of feel like you are quite a ways away.”
On Jan. 1, he’ll lead his second First Day Hike as the park manager. It’s a part of a national park program to get people out and active.
Nationwide, nearly 55,000 people participated last year, according to StateParks.org, logging 133,000 miles.
At Bradbury, they’ll log just two: One mile up to the summit via the Northern Loop Trail and one mile back down on the Terrace Trail.
It’s free to the public and takes off at 10 a.m.
“I’ll be telling about the ecosystem here, the animals we have living here, a lot of the park history,” Silsbee said. “If we see animal tracks, we’ll stop and look.”
Growing up in Caribou, Silsbee said he always loved the outdoors. At the University of Maine at Presque Isle, he got involved with the outing club and outdoor rec program.
His first job with the state was as a college intern with the Maine Forest Service and sent out West to fight fires.
“It wasn’t anything too drastic,” Silsbee said. “It was big fire danger year that year, there were many fires in many different states. I bounced around a lot: Washington, Idaho, Utah.”
His first ranger position was as an assistant at Lily Bay State Park in Greenville for three years. From there, he spent six years in the Penobscot River Corridor and seven in the Allagash as what’s called a back country ranger. Think lots of woods, few people and 11-hour working days.
Work was typically nine days on, four to five days off, and in the early part of his career, cellphone and Wi-Fi-free.
“You get up and you patrol your area, take care of your campsites, make sure you’re around to help people when they get into trouble,” he said. “At the end of the day you get back to your ranger cabin. I would spend my evenings fishing and just kind of going for a paddle in my kayak.”
Silsbee, who is also manager of Mackworth Island State Park outside of Falmouth, said his family has settled in nicely to the house provided inside the park.
“It’s a big house — I’ve got four kids, so we filled it,” he said. “Early in my career I never thought I’d find myself this far south, but living here now for a couple years, I’ve come to enjoy it.”

This week’s poem is by Sheila Wellehan of Cape Elizabeth. The poem originally appeared in the “Aurorean.”
Winter Moths
By Sheila Wellehan
They flock to me at dusk,
drawn to my headlamp.
The winter moths
enshroud me
in soft platinum cloth.
It’s long past the hard frost.
Ice glosses every pond,
all the moss.
Invasive moths mock the season
with their frenetic gothic waltz.
Next spring I’ll see
this strange beauty’s cost,
as their offspring maul leaves
bottom to top – this stand of old oaks
their ideal food trough.
Tonight I forget future sorrow and loss,
float in dreams I’d locked up or tossed,
as they caress both my shoulders,
muss my hair,
kiss my mouth.
Winter moths sweetly swarm me –
I’m a hostage of soft.

The 'New' and 'Old' of the New Year’s Holiday

Texto completo: Mention the name “Maine” and there’s a lot that sets us apart. We’re the state closest to Europe.
We’re the only one among the lower 48 that rubs elbows with only one other.
In recent months we have been showered daily reminders that we are the only jurisdiction to use Ranked Choice Voting on either a state-wide or Congressional district basis.
Also in keeping with our Dirigo – Latin for “We lead” — motto we get the jump on the rest of the country in experiencing the first daylight. We thus will see the sun in 2019 sooner than the rest of the nation. That is, if one is at either the summit of Cadillac Mountain or maybe also at Porcupine Mountain in Lubec, both of which are in contention for near simultaneous vantage points for fetching the first rays of sun in the U.S. at about 7:08 a.m. That’s because not only do other Maine locations see the sun later but also because other places in the nation observe it at the same point or even earlier than the rest of Maine.
Take even Mt. Katahdin, for example. Its nearly mile high altitude is over three times the height of Cadillac’s 1,529 foot summit. But when it sees the sun just a minute later than Cadillac it’s also at the same time as dozens of other locations in the East including Miami Beach. What a difference a minute can make!
No matter where one is at the time the sun rises Jan. 1, most in government, the professions, banking , education and other service sector professionals will have the day off. It’s also — due to celebrations that typically mark the night before — the day when Americans are more likely to stay in bed later than any other. Though according to Edison Research most wake up before 6:30 a.m. that time is more significantly pushed ahead on that morning more than any other.
The Jan. 1 rituals were not always so observed, however. For one thing, during the first 132 years of settlement in New England our years began with March 25. This was Annunciation Day, the time when by tradition the angel Gabriel announced or “annunciated” to Mary that she would be delivering Jesus. The March 25 day also was chosen because it corresponded to a time close to the start of spring. (It should thus come as no surprise this was also the month chosen to conduct town meetings.)
By the mid-18th century, Maine along with the rest of the British dominated domains juggled the calendar to revert to an early Roman practice of ringing in the year on the first of January. This was a date which in earlier times approximated the start of winter. London’s imperatives were carried out with surprisingly little challenge, despite some restlessness on other matters at that time. This was in part because many colonists including those in Maine had already made the shift to a newer New Year. It’s also of course a reminder that when our break from England came only a couple of decades later that it was not a cultural separation. We maintained the same language, holidays, and basic religious beliefs despite having forsaken tea for coffee.
Thus, such social touchstones as the calendar remained synchronized with those of England, Canada, and the rest of the “empire” countries. The situation is a reminder that our break from them was largely a political and not a cultural separation. The occurrence stood in contrast to the revolts in France in this era. There, the practice of substituting a “republican” — or egalitarian — calendar during its upheavals near the time of our own revolution helped illustrate how moderate our own severance from England was compared to the more strident episodes then unfolding in Paris.
America’s break from the British was then more a forerunner to Maine’s own emancipation from Massachusetts that occurred by 1820. To be sure, there was no Bunker Hill, Saratoga, or Valley Forge in our own revolt. The state following a pattern of the colonies’ departure from the rule of George III, remained tied into most of the same basic culinary tastes, fashions, and methods of time keeping as before.
When we became a state we continued with the same calendar. It took a while, however, before New Year’s Day would become a legal holiday. Sundays and days of “public fast” were the only ones in the early years of statehood. Though Christmas and Washington’s birthday would by the 1850’s be added, New Year’s Day didn’t emerge as a full-fledged “day off” holiday for the government until 1935, just after the end of Prohibition.
Whether one begins this new year on Mt. Cadillac, in Lubec, on Katahdin or Miami Beach, and no matter how early one rises that day, no matter how soon the moment arrives, the wisdom of James Russell Lowell has some modicum of timeless validity. For it is, as Lowell reminded us, “now later than it has ever been.”

Texto completo: WATERFORD — Maj. James Urquhart of the Oxford County Sheriff’s Office said the case involving a missing Waterford man has been handed off to the Major Crime Unit of the state police.
Ricky Howard, 49, of 440 Norway Road was reported missing by his family eight weeks ago and was last seen at AJ’s Everything Store in Stoneham near noon on Oct. 5.
His black 2008 Toyota RAV4 was discovered in Waterford on Oct. 7.
“We’re passing the case off to major crimes not because there’s anything suspicious about it, but because it’s protocol,” Urquhart said. “Right now, due to the weather and all the snow on the ground, we can’t do searches, but as soon as the weather permits, we’ll be back out there.”
Howard’s wife, Colleen, posted on her Facebook page that Howard was last seen “wearing a black zip-up hooded sweatshirt, a dark grey T-shirt with a logo, black sweatpants and black work boots.”
Any tips can be sent to her through Facebook, the Sheriff’s Office at 743-9554, or the Maine Warden Service in Augusta at 207-287-8000.

Texto completo: RUMFORD — Ski patrol apprentice Maia Belskis, 17, of Rumford, finds it rewarding to know she can help if someone gets hurt skiing.
The Mountain Valley High School junior is in her third year participating in Black Mountain of Maine’s Ski Patrol Apprenticeship program. It gives Mountain Valley students the opportunity to learn about the ski industry — from on-hill medical training and rescue evacuation to the logistics of running equipment and the economics of the business.
Belskis also volunteers for MedCare ambulance service. These experiences are giving her training to enter a medical field; she hopes to become a nurse anesthetist. “Everything that goes into this I have a passion for,” she said.
Students who participate in the program must have a letter of recommendation and be in good standing as a student. They must also be experienced skiers.
“You need to be able to get to a scene quickly,” said Belskis, who learned to ski at Black Mountain when she was 6.
The nonprofit ski area has youth in mind with most of its offerings, including ski camps, lessons and free passes for children in grades kindergarten to second.
Black Mountain opened for the season Dec. 26, said Amanda Carey, who was selling lift tickets Saturday with her mother, Kathy Carey.
It will offer two 12-week race camps for children ages 7 to 18. Those new to skiing can learn by participating in Kinder Club, for ages 3 to 6, or Snow Kids, ages 7 to 14, which last six weeks. Individual lessons are also available.
The mountain has 5 kilometers of Nordic trails open. It will offer tubing in January once more snow can be made, according to Kathy Carey. Eleven 11 trails are open to downhill skiing and snowboarding, she said.
Skiers and snowboarders can look forward to Free Ski nights when local businesses sponsor lift passes. These are usually from 4 to 9 p.m. Thursdays. Dates will be announced on the ski area’s website, skiblackmountain.org.
To accommodate those on holiday break, the ski area is open Friday to Tuesday from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Beginning Friday, Jan. 11, the regular hours will be Fridays and Saturdays, from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., and Sundays from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Lift passes are $40 for Rumford residents and $45 for nonresidents.

Texto completo: It can be tough to get any work done while working weekends sometimes. I had read about a Pride Festival happening in downtown Lewiston and thought it would be fun to attend. I knew a fair number of people there and could not get any pictures taken because everyone wanted to talk. I jumped from one conversation to the next and even heard a 25-minute story about one man’s experience with addiction and thoughts of suicide. Once the music started and the dancing began, all conversations were off, and I was finally able to do what I promised my boss I would do — take pictures. I have run into the man I had that long powerful conversation with numerous times since the Pride Festival. But, only on weekends.
Sometimes, it is the picture that you spend the least amount of time on that turns out the best. On primary election day, I was bouncing between the Janet Mills campaign headquarters in Lewiston and the Franco Center, where candidate Jared Golden was due to arrive after the polls closed at 8 p.m. Mills arrived early so I was able to get a shot of her as she waited for election results to roll in. Golden, on the other hand, did not arrive early. I gambled that Golden would not arrive anytime soon, and drove to Lisbon to find out where gubernatorial candidate Garrett Mason was keeping an eye on results. I found Mason underneath a wall of trophy deer shortly before 11 p.m., and spent an entire 30 seconds taking his picture before driving back to Lewiston to continue waiting for Jared Golden to arrive for his victory party.
Returnable bottles and cans stack up in my basement as well. And I know how an extra $20 can help out a few days before pay day. But I never imagined I would come across someone moving their stacks of 5-cent returnables by kayak in the middle of a snowstorm. My picture of Dean Bryant, left, and McKenzie Gurley using a kayak to haul their two-month supply of returnable bottles to Gowell’s Market in Auburn did not come out as well as I had hoped, but I will bet away my basement worth of returnables that I won’t come across this again.
Cynthia Riley had stage IV lung cancer when I met her at Central Maine Medical Center in Lewiston. She did not mention the word “cancer.” Instead, Riley spoke of the stray cats that she and her husband, Ed, paid to neuter and feed. She also spoke of Gunner, the therapy dog that she had met once before. “Who knew that this was going to be a happy chemo day,” Riley said after Gunner was placed in her lap. Riley passed away 10 days after I took this picture.

Texto completo: The sad and the bad drew several online readers to the sports pages of sunjournal.com in 2018.
But so did changes in leadership, as coaches left their posts, whether by their own choices or those of others.
Lewiston native Isaiah Harris generated a lot of interest as he reached track and field success at the national (NCAA championship) and international (earning first professional win in Spain) levels. The most popular story about Harris, though, was the one in which he sat down with Sun Journal reporter Randy Whitehouse and reflected on the impact of growing up Lewiston.
The Looking Back series, in which we caught up with former athletic standouts and looked back at their athletic careers were popular, but none more than the story about former Mt. Blue quarterback Dustin Ireland and his career in the Air Force.
Here are the 10 sports stories that were viewed most in 2018 and the dates they were published, all of which happened to occur in the final five months of the year:
1. Video shows Lisbon girls’ soccer player throwing punch that sparks outrage (Oct. 26)
2. Leavitt assistant coach Pete Casey dies unexpectedly (Nov. 9)
3. Bruce Nicholas fired as Lewiston football coach (Dec. 13)
4. Rivals uniting at football game to support Edward Little player’s family (Oct. 25)
5. Poland football coach Spencer Emerson leaving for school on ‘Last Chance U’ (Dec. 3)
6. After coach’s tirade against student goes online, Maine athletes say he did the same to them (Oct. 31)
7. Longtime football coach, administrator Mike Haley dies (Aug. 22)
8. Raised by Lewiston — Isaiah Harris remembers roots as he considers what’s next (Aug. 9)
9. Girls’ basketball: Scott Wing let go as Monmouth coach after back-to-back state titles (Nov. 16)

Texto completo: LEWISTON — Tragedy. That best describes the stories that got the most traffic on SunJournal.com in 2018 — stories about drownings and killings.
But there was also crime: Leading the list was the story of the day federal, state and local law enforcement officers raided local buildings and confiscated piles of marijuana plants.
And a bit of political drama attracted readers, too. Les Gibson and Susan Collins were the main characters of the political dramas that people around the United States wanted to read.
The oddest story to make the top 10 was the story about a March 7 winter storm heading for Maine. That tale of meteorological confusion got most of its traffic in November when a lot of people shared it on Facebook, apparently thinking it was a storm forecast for later that week.
Here’s the top stories that got the most traffic in 2018 with the dates they were published on the web:
1) Police raid more than 20 marijuana sites in Lewiston, Auburn area (Feb. 27)
2) Beleaguered Leslie Gibson abandons state House race, seeks ‘peace and quiet’ (March 16)
3) Rescuers pull victim, 5, from Androscoggin River in Auburn (April 24)
4) Lewiston Middle School student, 13, drowns during Range Pond field trip (June 12)
5) Maine doctor says she is likely to challenge Susan Collins for Senate in 2020 (June 29)
6) ‘Horrified’ Democrat decides to take on Gibson for House seat (March 15)
7) Auburn police identify woman’s body found Sunday in The Basin (July 30)
8) Wednesday’s storm could be biggest one this winter (March 6)
9) Family thanks volunteers after son’s body found in Androscoggin River (May 15)
10) Son of RSU 16 athletic director dies in Route 202 crash (Jan. 17)

Texto completo: The snidely dismissive version of an old saw had it that "those who can, write - and those who can't, teach," which is demonstrably bogus, considering the great legion of working scholars who have adroitly taught and written - notably, in recent memory, J.K. Rowling (who taught English in Portugal and turned out the "Harry Potter" books); Kenneth Millar (Ph.D., English, who taught high school in Toronto and college at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, and, as "Ross Macdonald," turned out best-selling detective Lew Archer books that became major movies); Robert Frost (Ph.D., poet, reminding his students at Amherst that indeed something there was that didn't love a wall); and - yes - Stephen King (high school English, Hampden Academy, Maine, from thence soon to scare his charges and all the rest of us with "Carrie," "Salem's Lot," "The Shining" and a long line of other inspired chillers.
So it is with the joy of continuing discovery that one encounters, under the long-respected Crippen & Landru imprint, the latest stellar example of simultaneous classroom and literary ambidexterity with "The Man Who Read Mysteries: The Short Fiction of William Brittain" (222 pp., $19), a collection of lively detective stories for all ages and imaginations with or without academic degrees.
Susan Brittain Gawley, the author's daughter, notes in an afterword that her late father - a Brockport State Teachers College and Hofstra University graduate who taught English at Lawrence Junior High School of Long Island - was also a disciplined writer who hammered out his stories on a Royal manual typewriter at night after she went to bed in the next room. Brittain was loved by his students and admired by his readers. Josh Pachter, an artful editor and author of the book's illuminating introduction, celebrates the 65 stories Brittain turned out throughout 19 years for publication in Ellery Queen's and Alfred Hitchcock's mystery magazines.
Readers will recall the small press Crippen & Landru (named after a couple of historically certifiable villains) was established in Norfolk 25 years ago by now-retired Old Dominion University professor Douglas Greene, who superintended the publishing of more than 100 short story collections by major detective and mystery writers. Mystery buff Jeff Marks of Cincinnati has taken on the C&L editorship in Greene's retirement. Mystery Scene Magazine endorses their combined efforts thus: "This is the best edited, most attractively packaged line of mystery books in this decade."
That they are. "The Man Who Read Mysteries: The Short Fiction of William Britain" delivers the requisite thrills and chills.
Also something even harder to summon up on cue: laughs. To learn more about this book and how to purchase it and other delightfully offbeat adventures from this imprint, email crippenlandru- @earthlink.net or visit crippenlandru.com.

Texto completo: Looking to move to a place where your money will go further?
Though everyone's list has different must-haves, many gravitate toward places with healthy economies, a reasonable cost of living and housing they can afford. Low crime, good schools and not terrible weather are also important. So are diversity, job opportunities and access to quality health care. And, there should be plenty to do in your off-hours.
That may be a lot to ask of a place to live, but there are many small cities and towns that make the grade.
At the end of every year, Money magazine ranks the best places to live in the United States, and Frisco, Texas, came out on top for 2018. This year, Money also culled through the data to select the best place to live in each of the 50 states.
Unsurprisingly, big cities with astronomically high costs of living such as San Francisco and New York did not make the list.

Determining which cities rose to the top
Money considered 70 data points to curate the list. To narrow down the list to desirable places to live, Money got rid of any place that had a crime rate that was double the national average, lacked ethnic diversity or had incomes 83 percent less than the state's national average.
The highest weighted factors were economic health, public school performance and local amenities, including the number of health-care facilities and leisure activities such as dining, cultural institutions and green spaces. Secondary factors were housing, cost of living and diversity.
Money also sent reporters to each place to check it out and gather anecdotal and less tangible data about the perks of living there.

Texto completo: A New York manhas been arrested and charged with trafficking drugs in September and October in the Gardiner area.
Man allegedly sold cocaine, fentanyl

A New York City man has been arrested and charged with four counts of unlawful trafficking in cocaine, heroin and fentanyl in September and October in Augusta, Gardiner and Randolph.
Michael Reyes, 32, made his initial appearance Monday at the Capital Judicial Center in Augusta and is being held in the Kennebec County jail in lieu of $10,000 cash bail.
Maine Drug Enforcement Agency Agent Jonathan Richards said in the probable cause affidavit filed with the court that when he arrested Reyes on Oct. 26 after an investigation detailed in the document, Reyes had 1.23 grams of crack cocaine in a single plastic bag, which tested positive for cocaine. Richards said Reyes, who is also known as ï¿½Miz,ï¿½ also had a plastic bag with 11 small, knotted bags totaling 3.5 grams. Testing showed the contents of those bags to be a heroin and fentanyl mixture.
In an interview after his arrest, Richards said Reyes said he had been coming to Maine for a few weeks to sell illegal drugs to make money.

Texto completo: NORRIDGEWOCK ï¿½ The first shipment of athletic shoes made by New Balance for the U.S. Department of Defense was sent this month as part of a new contract that fulfills a federal law requiring the military to outfit new recruits with American-made apparel.
About 206,000 pairs of a new model of shoe ï¿½ the 950v2 ï¿½ made by New Balance will be shipped in total, officials said Tuesday during a tour and visit from members of Maineï¿½s congressional delegation.
The shoe is 100 percent American-made and will be used to fulfill a $17.3 million contract with the U.S. Department of Defense to provide athletic shoes for military personnel entering basic training.
The contract was announced in March after years of back-and-forth among the company, lawmakers and the U.S. military, which had not been following a federal law requiring it to outfit recruits, when possible, with American-made apparel.
ï¿½Itï¿½s taken several years ï¿½ and when I say several, I mean more than three years ï¿½ of hard work and perseverance on the part of many people to get us to today, and itï¿½s an important milestone in our journey,ï¿½ said Dan Wheeler, an executive vice president at New Balance.
After a tour of the manufacturing floor at the plant on Depot Street, members of Maineï¿½s congressional delegation ï¿½ all clad in New Balance sneakers ï¿½ made remarks to the roughly 350 employees at the Norridgewock facility.
The company employs about 900 people in Maine, with additional locations in Skowhegan and Norway.
ï¿½What a momentous event this is,ï¿½ said U.S. Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine. ï¿½Iï¿½m so excited to return to New Balance, and this time not just to report on the latest legislative development in this endless battle, but to join you in celebrating this success. Our military will finally, finally be distributing made-in-America athletic shoes.ï¿½
U.S. Sen. Angus King, I-Maine, who is up for re-election and is part of a three-way race, also spoke Tuesday about his work as a member of the U.S. Senate Committee on Armed Services and how he introduced legislation in the 2017 National Defense Authorization Act to ensure the military would consider athletic footwear as subject to the Berry Amendment.
The amendment, passed in 1941, requires the U.S. military to provide its personnel with American-made equipment and uniforms to the greatest extent possible. While the military has long issued Berry-compliant items such as combat boots and service uniforms, it previously had been issuing athletic footwear to recruits that was not Berry Amendment-compliant.
The late Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., was among those who opposed the amendment being enforced because it would benefit a limited number of companies, King said, but King was able to convince other members of the armed services committee to approve the legislation.
U.S. Rep. Bruce Poliquin, R-2nd District, who fought for similar legislation in the House version of the National Defense Authorization Act, also praised employees at New Balance for their role in creating an American-made shoe. Poliquin is also up for re-election and is facing three opponents in the race to represent Maineï¿½s 2nd District.
ï¿½Iï¿½ve been waiting for this day for about three years,ï¿½ Poliquin said. ï¿½I know you folks have been waiting a lot longer. This is exactly what should happen. Our federal government has a job to protect us and to help with American-made jobs, not jobs overseas; American jobs.
ï¿½For us, itï¿½s Maine first, and I am absolutely thrilled to be here to celebrate with you. This could not be done unless everybody did this together.ï¿½
Employees at New Balance also lauded the contract with the U.S. military Tuesday, saying the move is a benefit to the economy and local jobs.
ï¿½Iï¿½m kind of an old-school girl, and I really do believe we need to bring jobs back,ï¿½ said Tanya Staples, who has worked for the company for 20 years. ï¿½I think weï¿½re going on a good trail here. I really believe that.ï¿½

Texto completo: A man received an abatement on his property in Dresden after the office has misplaced it or denied it since 2015. It's the latest in a string of problems at the Dresden Town Office that we reported on Aug. 28.
Officials urge end to elected office workers
DRESDEN ï¿½ In response to several reports of problems with elected administrative workers, Dresdenï¿½s Selectboard is looking to change those positions to ones that are appointive.
Selectwoman Trudy Foss said Tuesday that a letter will be mailed to all Dresden residents informing them of criticisms of the Town Office and urging them to support switching the positions from elective to appointive, probably on the next Town Meeting warrant.
Town Clerk and Treasurer Shirley Storkson said she was unaware of any mailer and declined to comment until she knows more about the situation. Her position, as well as that of excise tax collector and property tax collector, currently held by Ann Pierce, are the positions the town is suggesting be filled by appointment.
The catalyst for Fossï¿½s revelation was an incident involving misplaced homestead exemption paperwork, creating a four-year-long logjam for a property owner looking for a tax incentive. The paperwork problem wasnï¿½t the first time the problem was raised, however, as the Kennebec Journal reported in August that residents had complained of poor service at the Town Office.
At that time, Storkson said the town doesnï¿½t allocate enough hours for adequate coverage or for training. Experts said office staff members in small towns often struggle with juggling the responsibilities of multiple positions because of complex procedures.
Foss said selectmen have no power over the Town Office staff because they are both sets of elected officials. She said any guidelines or instructions for the office workers would come from state-level organizations, while selectmen only can suggest that the workers do things.
ï¿½If itï¿½s something they donï¿½t want to do and they donï¿½t feel they have to, they wonï¿½t listen to the selectmen,ï¿½ Foss said. ï¿½I wanted to run for selectman to give a little extra input, but it hasnï¿½t worked out.ï¿½
The only thing selectmen could do to exert more control over the officer workers, she said, would be to change the townï¿½s code to make their positions appointive. Foss said the town has discussed making the switch before, but townspeople favored voting for residents rather than potentially appointing outsiders.
ï¿½(The Selectboard) would like them appointed so we can hire people that have the knowledge they need to do these jobs,ï¿½ she said.
In August, Eric Conrad, spokesman for the Maine Municipal Association, told the Kennebec Journal that all sectors in Maine have struggled to find qualified workers. With Maineï¿½s average age increasing, he said, there is no guarantee that any highly qualified candidates will apply for municipal jobs.
ï¿½You might be hiring someone that works at a retail store that may have just as much background as an elected (official),ï¿½ he said Tuesday. ï¿½Either way, you have someone who has never had municipal experience.ï¿½
Selectmen voted unanimously Monday to grant Dresden property owner Ronald Wentworth an abatement for this yearï¿½s tax bill after he complained that Town Office workers had bungled his application for a homestead exemption affecting a property at 7 Middle Road.
At the meeting, the actual figure for the abatement was unknown, but it was granted anyway.
Wentworth, a Wiscasset man who travels to Florida for the winter, is listed as a co-owner of the property with his son-in-law Jonathan Doray, who Wentworth said has lived at the property since 2015. He said he applied for homestead exemption in 2015 but was denied.
ï¿½We first applied for the homestead act in 2015,ï¿½ Wentworth said at the meeting. ï¿½Because of retirement, I go to Florida in the winter and I never got the notification (that we were denied.)ï¿½
The homestead exemption applies to permanent residences in Maine and provides a reduction of up to $20,000 in the value of a home for property tax purposes. In 2018, the property at 7 Middle Road had an assessed value of $103,281, so an exemption would have meant the value was $83,281. Town Administrative Assistant Michael Henderson said Tuesday the abatement given was for $358.38.
Henderson said the 2015 exemption request was denied because not all parties were on the deed for the property; it was edited in November 2015.
Because Wentworth leaves for Florida in November, he applied for the exemption in October 2016, but he claimed that when he returned from Florida in May 2017, that the paperwork was lost and the exemption was not granted. He said he applied again in 2018, prior to the April 1 deadline, and that paperwork also was lost.
Henderson said during the meeting that the office has the 2015 application, the subsequent denial letter and the newest application, but nothing from two other applications Wentworth described.
ï¿½I canï¿½t say if thatï¿½s us losing it,ï¿½ he said.
Wentworth said he applied again this year, after the April 1 deadline, and provided a second copy of the deed for the property, which was lost along with the paperwork.
ï¿½It seems likes your administrative office has some problems,ï¿½ he said.
Wentworth asked selectmen for a tax abatement in the amount of what would have been the homestead exemption for 2017 and 2018, citing ï¿½clerical errorsï¿½ at the office.
Selectman Alan Moeller said in a Tuesday phone call that this problem does not reflect on the current Town Office staff, as it happened before their election. He said itï¿½s difficult to condemn the Town Office staff from 2016 and 2017 because there is no proof that the forms were neither lost nor filed by Wentworth.
ï¿½I donï¿½t want to point fingers because thereï¿½s no proof to point fingers,ï¿½ Moeller said.
Pierce and Foss both served as administrative workers during the entire timeline of Wentworthï¿½s problem.
Foss said the homestead exemption will be attached to Wentworthï¿½s property for the next fiscal year. She did not recall dealing with Wentworth between the first application and the most recent application.
ï¿½I know nothing about (lost paperwork,)ï¿½ she said. ï¿½If he applied again, he didnï¿½t do it with me.ï¿½

Texto completo: NORRIDGEWOCK ï¿½ Both of Maineï¿½s U.S. senators said Tuesday they strongly oppose President Donald Trumpï¿½s plan to issue an executive order revoking birthright citizenship for the children of noncitizens and unauthorized immigrants born in the U.S.
ï¿½I completely disagree with that,ï¿½ U.S. Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said in an interview after a press event and tour of the New Balance athletic shoe company. ï¿½If you are born in this country, you are an American. To me itï¿½s that simple.ï¿½
Collins said an executive order rescinding birthright citizenship would be subject to a court challenge, and she believes the courts probably would invalidate the order.
U.S. Sen. Angus King, I-Maine, also responded in an interview after the event, by saying he was against the presidentï¿½s proposal. ï¿½Iï¿½m concerned about any president trying to rewrite the Constitution by themselves,ï¿½ King said. ï¿½Thatï¿½s not the way our process works. I think there would almost certainly be a lawsuit and the courts will decide. But the 14th Amendment of the Constitution is very clear.ï¿½
U.S. Rep. Bruce Poliquin, R-2nd District, who was also at Tuesdayï¿½s event at the shoe factory, initially said he was not aware of the issue and declined to comment.
ï¿½I didnï¿½t see that,ï¿½ Poliquin said. ï¿½Iï¿½m focused on the 900 jobs here at New Balance. For me, itï¿½s all about jobs in Maine, keeping our families safe and making sure we have opportunities. We are here to celebrate this win at New Balance.ï¿½
Later in the afternoon, a spokesman for Poliquin issued a statement from the congressman that still did not take a position on the presidentï¿½s executive order, but rather said, ï¿½We must be strong on border security, we must make sure those who enter our country do so legally, and we must know who is here in our country.ï¿½
He also added, ï¿½Certainly any executive order or law must pass Constitutional muster.ï¿½
U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree, D-1st District, was not at Tuesdayï¿½s event, which was held outside her congressional district, but her office issued a statement later in the day on Trumpï¿½s remarks.
ï¿½No President has the power to unilaterally change the constitution, nor should they,ï¿½ Pingree said. ï¿½Just as his claims of passing a tax bill while Congress is out of session were false, President Trumpï¿½s comments about American-born children are also untrue.
ï¿½One week before an election he has deliberately diverted attention away from his administrationï¿½s attempts to undo patient protections for people with pre-existing conditions and their deficit-exploding tax cuts for corporations.ï¿½
Trumpï¿½s remarks came in an interview with the news website Axios released Tuesday and follow similar hardline immigration rhetoric from the president seen in the weeks leading up to the midterm elections.
ï¿½Weï¿½re the only country in the world where a person comes in, has a baby and the baby is essentially a citizen of the United States for 85 years with all of those benefits,ï¿½ Trump said. ï¿½Itï¿½s ridiculous. Itï¿½s ridiculous and it has to end.ï¿½
Thirty of the worldï¿½s 194 countries, including both Canada and the U.S., have policies of birthright citizenship, according to the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates for low levels of immigration.
In remarks with reporters, Collins also addressed the climate of the country in the wake of bombs sent to critics of Trump earlier this month and the shooting of more than a dozen people at a Jewish synagogue in Pittsburgh over the weekend.
ï¿½Iï¿½m very concerned we seem to have lost a sense of community and caring in this country,ï¿½ Collins said. ï¿½It is never acceptable for violence to be used, whether itï¿½s an attack that happened a year ago from a Bernie Sanders supporter, where he shot the Republican leader in the House, Steve Scalise; or whether itï¿½s pipe bombs being sent to critics of Donald Trump; or whether itï¿½s shooting up a synagogue, a place of worship, in Pittsburgh. It is never acceptable to resort to violence.ï¿½
Asked whether she thinks the president has a responsibility to set a better tone for the nation, Collins said, ï¿½I think each of us has a responsibility. There is a real problem in our country today, where people are disrespectful to people who have alternative views, and thereï¿½s a lack of tolerance for differing points of view.
ï¿½Unfortunately, the rhetoric on both sides has been far too heated, and I believe everyone from the president to members of the House and Senate to local and state leaders have an obligation to calm down the rhetoric and remember what unites us as Americans.ï¿½

Texto completo: Executive director of Mid-Maine Homeless Shelter resigned to focus on family, health
WATERVILLE ï¿½ Betty Palmer says it was an honor to serve eight years as executive director of the Mid-Maine Homeless Shelter, where she met thousands of good people, including volunteers, staff, guests and donors.
ï¿½It has been my honor to serve God and to work with these wonderful people,ï¿½ Palmer said Tuesday in a Facebook message.
The shelterï¿½s board of directors on Friday announced the resignation of Palmer, who saw the shelter through a transition in 2012 from an old house on Ticonic Street to a new $2.9 million shelter on Colby Circle.
On Tuesday, Palmer was in northern Maine, where she said cellphone coverage is sketchy, so she responded via Facebook to questions about her resignation.
She said she is now focusing on her health and her family, while dealing with diabetes.
ï¿½Last year I had a health scare,ï¿½ she said. ï¿½Iï¿½m better now and ready for whatï¿½s next, but it caused me to pause and to think about spending more time with my grandchildren and my children and still being around to have great-grandchildren. I donï¿½t want to miss family events anymore, so I reallocated my life, looked at my priorities.ï¿½
Palmer said she is thankful for the eight years she spent at the shelter, putting the community first; but at this time, God and family are first in her life.
ï¿½My health is important to me,ï¿½ she said. ï¿½Diabetes is a progressive disease. Most doctors believe it canï¿½t be cured; however, it can be stabilized. Iï¿½m on a reasonable scheduled diet, movement; I will be healthy and around, by Godï¿½s grace, God willing.
Palmer said she wants weekends and evenings free.
ï¿½It may seem selfish, but for the first time in my life, itï¿½s time for me and for family,ï¿½ she said.
She said she wants to thank everyone with whom she has come in contact over the years.
ï¿½I believe that we are who we are because of whom we have shared life with,ï¿½ she said. ï¿½Each time we brush our lives across somebody elseï¿½s palate, anytime they brush their color across ours, our lives become richer and fuller. As I end my eight years serving God at the Mid-Maine Homeless Shelter, I leave it full of joy and love. My heart is full for all the experiences that Iï¿½ve had. I look forward to what God has next. I donï¿½t know where my next employment will be. I donï¿½t know what Iï¿½m called to do, but I know that God will provide something that will give me great life balance, more time to serve God in my local church and community, more time to play with my grandchildren, more time to take care of my health, more time to develop as a stronger Christian woman leader in our community.ï¿½
Palmer said she had eight wonderful years at the shelter.
ï¿½We accomplished so much toward the vision and mission of ending homelessness in this community. And Iï¿½d like to thank the community for all the support, all eight years with great staff and a wonderful, compassionate community that we live in.ï¿½
She said the shelter was ï¿½awesomeï¿½ at giving people a hand up and second and third chances, when needed.
ï¿½We are awesome at teaching people to fish, not just giving them fish. The shelter staff is just premier in getting people housed, in getting them employed and stabilized, giving them a chance to have a future, leveling the playing field.ï¿½
Sandy Myers, president of the shelterï¿½s board of directors, said the shelter hopes to hire a new executive director before the end of the year. The shelterï¿½s finance director, Karyn Bournival, is serving as interim director.
The 19 Colby St. shelter currently has 45 guests as well as more than a dozen people living in its 12-unit Youth Empowerment Services apartments on the second floor, according to Myers.
The shelter operates on a budget of about $1 million a year and employs 27 full- and part-time staff members. About 25 percent of the shelterï¿½s funding comes from federal and state programs and the rest is from fundraising, donations and events, she said.

Texto completo: EPA eyes changing tribal water rules
PORTLAND ï¿½ The Environmental Protection Agency is seeking to change water quality standards for Maine rivers where members of American Indian tribes maintain fishing rights.
The new push is an outgrowth of a long legal struggle among the EPA, the Maine Department of Environmental Protection and the Penobscot Nation and Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians. The EPA imposed stricter criteria for a pair of Maine rivers at the end of President Barack Obamaï¿½s administration, but court documents say the EPA wants to revisit those standards.
Tribes fear that means weaker protections. The Bangor Daily News reported lawyers for the tribes are pushing back at the possibility of a rollback of standards.
A federal judge is holding a hearing on an EPA motion related to the case Tuesday in Portland.
1 in Canada, 1 still in US after incident
HOULTON ï¿½ Officials say a man from Canada accused of causing a disruption at the border at Houlton that halted traffic for hours is facing charges in his home country.
The Royal Canadian Mounted Police reported that a 21-year-old man from Halifax, Nova Scotia, has been charged with obstruction in connection with the incident on Friday. A U.S. official said a second man, from Middle Sackville, Nova Scotia, is in custody of immigration officials.
Compiled from wire reports
The Mounties say the men stopped their vehicle between the ports of entry at Houlton and Woodstock, New Brunswick, and refused to communicate with authorities from either country.
The border was shut down during the incident and traffic was re-routed. The men were arrested hours later when the vehicle began moving toward the U.S. border.
Warrant that led to exhuming pigs challenged in court
SWANVILLE ï¿½ A search warrant that allowed animal welfare officials to exhume the corpses of several dead pigs at a Maine farm is being challenged by the farmï¿½s owner.
The dead pigs that agents seized from Jerry Irelandï¿½s Ireland Hill Farms in Swanville later became evidence that led to the farmer eventually being charged with 13 counts of cruelty toward animals. The Bangor Daily News reported Ireland is accused of killing his malnourished pigs before they could be inspected.
Irelandï¿½s attorney argues the warrant was defective because it wasnï¿½t specific enough and any evidence turned up by it should be suppressed. The prosecution said evidence filed in a previous affidavit did support a probable cause search.
The presiding judge asked for written closing arguments by November.
UMaine foundation had record fundraising year in 2018
ORONO ï¿½ The University of Maine Foundation says it capped a record year for fundraising in fiscal 2018.
University of Maine Foundation president Jeff Mills said the foundation received gifts and pledges totaling $36.9 million in the fiscal year. That number was an increase of 115 percent from the previous year.
The foundation said the fundraising brought its ï¿½Vision for Tomorrowï¿½ drive over $160 million, which is 80 percent of its goal. The university calls the drive a ï¿½comprehensive campaignï¿½ to advance the university on the national and international stages and better serve students.
The university said it received the largest capital gift in its history, a $10 million sum supporting the Engineering Education and Design Center.
Officials to consider turning Mercy Hospital into shelter
PORTLAND ï¿½ An architect has proposed using Maineï¿½s Mercy Hospital building for a homeless shelter.
The Portland Press Herald reported 69-year-old M. Curt Sachs recently submitted a proposal to turn the State Street hospital into a homeless shelter and neighborhood health clinic. Mercy Hospital plans to move all operations to its Fore River site and sell the current hospital.
Sachs said the shelter would need support from the city, hospitals and social services. He said the building could replace the Oxford Street shelter, which is looking for a larger home.
The cause is important to Sachs, whose 28-year-old daughter has struggled with substance abuse and is homeless.
Mayor Ethan Strimling said councilors should consider Sachsï¿½ idea and other plans.
Proposals for the building are due Nov. 1.
Samuel Adams to release commemorative Boston Red Sox beer
BOSTON ï¿½ Boston-based Samuel Adams will release a commemorative limited-run beer this week to celebrate the 2018 World Series-winning Boston Red Sox.
The Boston Beer Company, which operates the Samuel Adams brand, said it will release the special Damage Done Double IPA for this week only. The beer company said the New England-style India pale ale will be available at the Samuel Adams Brewery in Boston in 32-ounce cans and on draft starting 5 p.m. Tuesday.
This is the first year that Samuel Adams was named the official beer of the Red Sox. In October, the beer brand made a playoff bet with Brooklyn Brewery. The New York-based brewery lost and temporarily renamed one of its beers for the Red Sox.

MANCHESTER, N.H. ï¿½ Police in New Hampshire say they are investigating swastikas spray-painted in Manchester over the weekend.
Manchester police say the swastikas were spray-painted at two different locations between Friday night and Sunday. WMUR-TV reported authorities are also looking into other pieces of graffiti found in several other locations of the city over the weekend.
Democratic Manchester Mayor Joyce Craig said ï¿½symbols of hate have no place in our community.ï¿½
Anyone with information is asked to contact Manchester police.
Utility says pipeline replacement to be completed this week
LAWRENCE, Mass. ï¿½ The pipeline upgrade work that triggered natural gas explosions and fires in three Massachusetts communities last month is slated to be finished this week ahead of schedule.
Columbia Gas said in a newsletter to customers Monday that replacement of about 45 miles of gas mains and nearly 6,000 service lines across Lawrence, Andover and North Andover should be complete by Oct. 31 ï¿½ almost three weeks early.
The company has said previously it wonï¿½t meet a Nov. 19 deadline for restoring gas service to all customers. It now expects to complete that work by Dec. 16.
Thousands of customers have been without gas since the Sept. 13 incident that killed one person, injured 25 others and damaged or destroyed more than 130 structures.
Investigators have blamed overpressurization of gas lines.
Arizona inspectors help restore pipelines in Massachusetts
PHOENIX ï¿½ Arizona safety inspectors are lending their expertise in Massachusetts, where pipeline explosions last month killed one person and injured several others.
The Arizona Corporation Commission said two inspectors from their pipeline safety section began restoration work Monday in Merrimack Valley.
The two men will help crews inspect pipeline through Nov. 24.
Authorities say a series of explosions on Sept. 13 decimated homes and left 11,000 households without gas service.
Investigators found the cause was excessive pressure in natural gas lines.
Crews are still working to replace nearly 45 miles of mainline gas pipes and more than 6,000 service lines connecting residences and business.
Gas service is still shut off for a majority of the area.
Family of student who died at eating contest sue university
BRIDGEPORT, Conn. ï¿½ The mother of a Connecticut college student who choked to death on pancakes during an eating contest on campus last year has filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the university.
Rosanne Nelson sued Sacred Heart University on Monday in Bridgeport state court over the death of her daughter, 20-year-old Caitlin Nelson, of Clark, New Jersey. The lawsuit seeks an undisclosed amount of money and accuses the school of approving the contest despite the dangers and failing to provide adequate medical personnel.
Officials at the Catholic university in Fairfield declined to comment.
Caitlin Nelson was a junior social work major whose father, police officer James Nelson, was killed in the Sept. 11 attacks in Manhattan. She died at a New York City hospital three days after participating in the eating contest.
Couple dies after being swept to sea while fishing
JAMESTOWN, R.I. ï¿½ Rhode Island officials have identified the Massachusetts couple who died after being swept into the sea while fishing off some rocks at a state park.
The Department of Environmental Management said Monday that 51-year-old Kongjuan Wei and 52-year-old Xianzan Tan were pronounced dead at Newport Hospital after being pulled from the waters off Fort Wetherill State Park in Jamestown by the U.S. Coast Guard.
Witnesses on Sunday morning said they saw a large wave knock Wei down onto the rocks and drag Wei into the water. Tan then jumped into the water in an attempt to rescue her.
The couple lived in Quincy, Massachusetts.
Environmental Police estimated waves in the range of six to eight feet, generated by Saturdayï¿½s norï¿½easter, were breaking onto the ocean-facing coast of Jamestown.
2 plead guilty in scheme to manufacture illegal guns
HARTFORD, Conn. ï¿½ Federal prosecutors in Connecticut say two men have pleaded guilty to charges related to the illegal manufacture and sale of machine guns.
Authorities say 39-year-old Sean Day of Torrington made weapons including AK-47 style and AR-style guns and arranged with 69-year-old George Jaiman of Bridgeport to sell them. Neither man had a license to deal firearms.
The U.S. attorneyï¿½s office announced Monday that Dey pleaded guilty last week in Hartford federal court to charges including conspiracy to engage unlawfully in the sale of firearms. Jaiman pleaded guilty to unlawful possession of a machine gun.
The two men are scheduled to be sentenced in January.

$17.3M deal ships Maine-made shoes after lengthy fight
NORRIDGEWOCK ï¿½ The first shipment of athletic shoes made by New Balance for the U.S. Department of Defense will be sent this month as part of a new contract that fulfills a federal law requiring the military to outfit new recruits with American-made apparel.
About 206,000 pairs of a new model of shoe ï¿½ the 950v2 ï¿½ made by New Balance will be shipped starting this month, officials said Tuesday during a tour and visit from members of Maineï¿½s congressional delegation.
The shoe is 100 percent American-made and will be used to fulfill a $17.3 million contract with the U.S. Department of Defense to provide athletic shoes for military personnel entering basic training.
The contract was announced in March after years of back-and-forth among the company, lawmakers and the U.S. military, which had not been following a federal law requiring it to outfit recruits, when possible, with American-made apparel.
ï¿½Itï¿½s taken several years ï¿½ and when I say several, I mean more than three years ï¿½ of hard work and perseverance on the part of many people to get us to today, and itï¿½s an important milestone in our journey,ï¿½ said Dan Wheeler, an executive vice president at New Balance.
After a tour of the manufacturing floor at the plant on Depot Street, members of Maineï¿½s congressional delegation ï¿½ all clad in New Balance sneakers ï¿½ made remarks to the roughly 350 employees at the Norridgewock facility.
The company employs about 900 people in Maine, with additional locations in Skowhegan and Norway.
ï¿½What a momentous event this is,ï¿½ said U.S. Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine. ï¿½Iï¿½m so excited to return to New Balance, and this time not just to report on the latest legislative development in this endless battle, but to join you in celebrating this success. Our military will finally, finally be distributing made-in-America athletic shoes.ï¿½
U.S. Sen. Angus King, I-Maine, who is up for re-election and is part of a three-way race, also spoke Tuesday about his work as a member of the U.S. Senate Committee on Armed Services and how he introduced legislation in the 2017 National Defense Authorization Act to ensure the military would consider athletic footwear as subject to the Berry Amendment.
The amendment, passed in 1941, requires the U.S. military to provide its personnel with American-made equipment and uniforms to the greatest extent possible. While the military has long issued Berry-compliant items such as combat boots and service uniforms, it previously had been issuing athletic footwear to recruits that was not Berry Amendment-compliant.
The late Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., was among those who opposed the amendment being enforced because it would benefit a limited number of companies, King said, but King was able to convince other members of the armed services committee to approve the legislation.
U.S. Rep. Bruce Poliquin, R-2nd District, who fought for similar legislation in the House version of the National Defense Authorization Act, also praised employees at New Balance for their role in creating an American-made shoe. Poliquin is also up for re-election and is facing three opponents in the race to represent Maineï¿½s 2nd District.
ï¿½Iï¿½ve been waiting for this day for about three years,ï¿½ Poliquin said. ï¿½I know you folks have been waiting a lot longer. This is exactly what should happen. Our federal government has a job to protect us and to help with American-made jobs, not jobs overseas; American jobs.
ï¿½For us, itï¿½s Maine first, and I am absolutely thrilled to be here to celebrate with you. This could not be done unless everybody did this together.ï¿½
Employees at New Balance also lauded the contract with the U.S. military Tuesday, saying the move is a benefit to the economy and local jobs.
ï¿½Iï¿½m kind of an old-school girl, and I really do believe we need to bring jobs back,ï¿½ said Tanya Staples, who has worked for the company for 20 years. ï¿½I think weï¿½re going on a good trail here. I really believe that.ï¿½

Texto completo: NORRIDGEWOCK ï¿½ Both of Maineï¿½s U.S. senators said Tuesday they strongly oppose President Donald Trumpï¿½s plan to issue an executive order revoking birthright citizenship for the children of noncitizens and unauthorized immigrants born in the U.S.
ï¿½I completely disagree with that,ï¿½ U.S. Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said in an interview after a press event and tour of the New Balance athletic shoe company. ï¿½If you are born in this country, you are an American. To me itï¿½s that simple.ï¿½
Collins said an executive order rescinding birthright citizenship would be subject to a court challenge, and she believes the courts probably would invalidate the order.
U.S. Sen. Angus King, I-Maine, also responded in an interview after the event, by saying he was against the presidentï¿½s proposal. ï¿½Iï¿½m concerned about any president trying to rewrite the Constitution by themselves,ï¿½ King said. ï¿½Thatï¿½s not the way our process works. I think there would almost certainly be a lawsuit and the courts will decide. But the 14th Amendment of the Constitution is very clear.ï¿½
U.S. Rep. Bruce Poliquin, R-2nd District, who was also at Tuesdayï¿½s event at the shoe factory, initially said he was not aware of the issue and declined to comment.
ï¿½I didnï¿½t see that,ï¿½ Poliquin said. ï¿½Iï¿½m focused on the 900 jobs here at New Balance. For me, itï¿½s all about jobs in Maine, keeping our families safe and making sure we have opportunities. We are here to celebrate this win at New Balance.ï¿½
Later in the afternoon, a spokesman for Poliquin issued a statement from the congressman that still did not take a position on the presidentï¿½s executive order, but rather said, ï¿½We must be strong on border security, we must make sure those who enter our country do so legally, and we must know who is here in our country.ï¿½
He also added, ï¿½Certainly any executive order or law must pass Constitutional muster.ï¿½
U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree, D-1st District, was not at Tuesdayï¿½s event, which was held outside her congressional district, but her office issued a statement later in the day on Trumpï¿½s remarks.
ï¿½No President has the power to unilaterally change the constitution, nor should they,ï¿½ Pingree said. ï¿½Just as his claims of passing a tax bill while Congress is out of session were false, President Trumpï¿½s comments about American-born children are also untrue.
ï¿½One week before an election he has deliberately diverted attention away from his administrationï¿½s attempts to undo patient protections for people with pre-existing conditions and their deficit-exploding tax cuts for corporations.ï¿½
Trumpï¿½s remarks came in an interview with the news website Axios released Tuesday and follow similar hardline immigration rhetoric from the president seen in the weeks leading up to the midterm elections.
ï¿½Weï¿½re the only country in the world where a person comes in, has a baby and the baby is essentially a citizen of the United States for 85 years with all of those benefits,ï¿½ Trump said. ï¿½Itï¿½s ridiculous. Itï¿½s ridiculous and it has to end.ï¿½
Thirty of the worldï¿½s 194 countries, including both Canada and the U.S., have policies of birthright citizenship, according to the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates for low levels of immigration.
In remarks with reporters, Collins also addressed the climate of the country in the wake of bombs sent to critics of Trump earlier this month and the shooting of more than a dozen people at a Jewish synagogue in Pittsburgh over the weekend.
ï¿½Iï¿½m very concerned we seem to have lost a sense of community and caring in this country,ï¿½ Collins said. ï¿½It is never acceptable for violence to be used, whether itï¿½s an attack that happened a year ago from a Bernie Sanders supporter, where he shot the Republican leader in the House, Steve Scalise; or whether itï¿½s pipe bombs being sent to critics of Donald Trump; or whether itï¿½s shooting up a synagogue, a place of worship, in Pittsburgh. It is never acceptable to resort to violence.ï¿½
Asked whether she thinks the president has a responsibility to set a better tone for the nation, Collins said, ï¿½I think each of us has a responsibility. There is a real problem in our country today, where people are disrespectful to people who have alternative views, and thereï¿½s a lack of tolerance for differing points of view.
ï¿½Unfortunately, the rhetoric on both sides has been far too heated, and I believe everyone from the president to members of the House and Senate to local and state leaders have an obligation to calm down the rhetoric and remember what unites us as Americans.ï¿½

Harvard to honor Malala Yousafzai
Nobel Prize Winner Malala Yousafzai is being honored by Harvard University for her work promoting girls' education. Harvard's Kennedy School says Yousafzai will be awarded the 2018 Gleitsman Award at a Dec. 6 ceremony. Yousafzai became the youngest person to win the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 when she was recognized for her global work supporting schooling for all children. As a teen in Pakistan, she survived an assassination attempt by the Taliban. She later founded the nonprofit Malala Fund to support her work. Now 20, Yousafzai is a student at Oxford University in England. (AP)

Tribes challenge EPA water standard
A pair of Native American tribes in Maine brought its concern the Environmental Protection Agency will change water quality standards on rivers where members maintain fishing rights to court Tuesday. The Penobscot Nation and Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians are involved in a legal struggle over water quality on Maine rivers that also involves the EPA and the Maine Department of Environmental Protection. The EPA imposed stricter criteria for a pair of Maine rivers at the end of President Obama's administration, but court documents filed earlier this month show the EPA wants to revisit those standards. The EPA's court filings state that federal agencies are allowed to "reconsider the wisdom of their policies in response to a change in administrations." But the tribes fear that could mean weaker protections for the Penobscot and the Meduxnekeag rivers. Federal judge Jon Levy held a hearing on an EPA motion related to the case at US District Court in Portland. (AP)

Anonymous buyer saves elderly woman's house
An anonymous buyer is purchasing a property on Applecrest Farm Orchards so an 85-year-old woman, who has lived there for decades, can spend the rest of her years there, according to her family. Gertrude "Gert" Eaton, 85, and her family said they were approached by a man a couple weeks ago about purchasing the Nason Road property, where Eaton claims farm owners promised decades ago she could live the rest of her life. They say the buyer closed Oct. 24 on the property, which Applecrest owners have said they are being forced by their bank to sell to address financial concerns. The Eaton family announced the sale was happening in a post over the weekend on a GoFundMe page set up by Eaton's daughter Trudy and neighbor Wendy Harrington. The family said the buyer knows their identity will be made public once the sale is reflected in town records. (AP)

UMaine foundation sets fund-raising record
The University of Maine Foundation says it capped a record year for fund-raising in fiscal 2018. University of Maine Foundation president Jeff Mills says the foundation received gifts and pledges totaling $36.9 million in the fiscal year. That number was an increase of 115 percent from the previous year. The foundation says the fund-raising brought its "Vision for Tomorrow" drive over $160 million, which is 80 percent of its goal.

Keep an eye out for whales

Texto completo: Female whales are beginning their annual migration along the Atlantic coast, which could provide opportunities for sighting along the Maryland and Delaware shorelines.
Each fall, North Atlantic right whales head south to give birth and nurse their young, said Jennifer Dittman, director of animal rescue at the National Aquarium.
In spring, they will travel back north to feed on small bait fish off Cape Cod, she said.
"They like areas that are cooler and nutrient rich," Dittman said.
Right whales travel more than 1,000 miles from their feeding grounds off the Canadian Maritimes and New England to the warm coastal waters of South Carolina, Georgia and northeastern Florida, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
The whales are mostly spotted in Atlantic coastal waters or close to the continental shelf, although movements over deep waters are known, according to NOAA. Most known right whale nursery areas are in shallow, coastal waters.
NOAA Fisheries has designated two critical habitat areas determined to provide feeding, nursery and calving habitat for the North Atlantic population of right whales: a foraging area off the coast of New England and a calving area Cape Fear, North Carolina, to below Cape Canaveral, Florida.
North Atlantic right whales are the most prevalent in the area, but Dittman said humpback and minke whales can also be seen along the Maryland Delaware coasts.
A humpback whale was spotted off of Ocean City recently, she said.
Humpback whales feed during spring, summer, and fall in an area that extends across the Atlantic Ocean from Maine to Norway, according to NOAA. They migrate south during the winter to calve and mate in the West Indies and Cape Verde off the coast of Africa.
Minke whales also travel along the East Coast, but also live in the Pacific Ocean and off the coasts of Australia and South Africa.
While there are better opportunities to spot whales during their migrations, they can be seen in this area year-round, Dittman said.
"They follow the food," she said.
Commercial whaling during the 19th century brought the populations near extinction, and some species remain on the list of endangered species.
The North Atlantic right whale is one of the world's most endangered large whale species, with only an estimated 450 remaining, according to NOAA's website.
The biggest threats to whales are entanglement in fishing gear and vessel strikes, according to NOAA.
Dittman said as the whale populations rebound, the opportunity to spot them from land on onboard a boat increases, but she cautions boaters not to get too close.
"Definitely give it a lot of space," she said.

Texto completo: The Brewer School Department has distanced itself from a political mailer endorsing Rep. Garrel Craig's re-election that used the Brewer High School Witches logo.
"The Brewer School Department does not endorse any candidate or party and did not do so in this instance," Superintendent Cheri Towle wrote in a notice posted to the school department's website Tuesday. "We apologize that our logo was used without our permission and are seeking trademark status on our logo to prevent this in the future."
The mailer, paid for and authorized by the House Republican Fund, featured the Brewer Witches logo on one side, and a message "From the desks of Ed Youngblood and Ed Donnelly" endorsing Craig, R-Brewer, in Tuesday's election on the other. The House Republican Fund is the campaign arm of the Maine House Republican caucus.

Youngblood said the name "Ed Donnelly" carried the wrong first name, though he did not confirm the identity of his co-signer.
Craig said he was unaware of the mailer and its use of the Brewer Witches logo until he received it in the mail like other Brewer residents.
"There's no copyright or trademark, so have I stolen their logo?" he said.
Towle said she received complaints from residents who were confused about whether the school department was endorsing Craig. She said she put out the notice to ensure that parents and residents knew the House Republican Fund had not asked the school department for permission to use the logo.
"If they had asked me, I would have said no because it's not our school department's right to share our views on any political party or candidate," she said.
The Witches logo is protected under intellectual property laws, Towle said. "To think that anyone can use it just because it isn't trademarked is just wrong," he said.
Craig said he believed the reaction to the mailer was "more of a political thing."
Youngblood said he didn't know, either, about the use of the Brewer Witches logo until he received the mailer at the same time as everyone else.
"I had just seen the wording of my addition to it," he said, explaining that he was aware of the content but not the House Republican Fund's choice to use the Witches image.
"I've seen that logo used for an awful lot of things over the years," he said. "I don't think it was meant to imply the endorsement of the school department."
Towle said local businesses sometimes use the logo for nonpolitical purposes but always with permission from the school department.
"It doesn't matter who it was, the use of the school logo on a political ad is inappropriate," she said. "We're here to educate children, not choose political sides."
Youngblood said he thought the superintendent's notice was the right approach for the school department, but he believed that residents who complained about the use of the logo were overreacting.
"I'm confident that all the complaints are coming from residents from the other party," he said.
Brewer resident David Fitzpatrick, who received the mailer earlier this week, said he found the use of the Brewer Witches logo inappropriate as a Brewer taxpayer.
"How many people are assuming that the school is supporting this candidate?" he said. "I think this should be investigated. I'd like to know who made the decision, who approved it and who thought this was a good idea."
Neither Rep. Ken Fredette, the House Republican leader and principal officer of the House Republican Fund, nor House Republican Fund treasurer Ryan Lorrain answered questions about the mailer and the decision to use the Brewer Witches logo.
As Election Day approaches, the House Republican Fund and other political committees are required to file notices with the Maine Ethics Commission within 24 hours of making outside expenditures, including mailers and other advertisements, in legislative races. As of late Wednesday, the ethics commission hadn't received a report on the mailer supporting Craig.
Craig is running for re-election against Democrat Archie Verow in House District 128, which covers part of Brewer. Verow held the seat for two terms before Craig defeated him in 2016.

Texto completo: Midcoast Actors' Studio's production of "The Crucible" is raw, real and relevant.
Director Jason Bannister said in his program note that he chose the play because "it's a tragic reminder of the power of fear mongering, hysteria and the art of persuasion."
No one could have predicted the show would open the weekend a gunman, reportedly fueled by online fearmongering, hysteria and persuasion, would massacre 11 people in a Pittsburgh synagogue. That event made the play's message modern and immediate.
Arthur Miller's "The Crucible" is a cautionary tale first performed in 1953. On its surface, it is a story about how the antics of teenage girls in 17th century Salem, Massachusetts, grew into a frenzy that caused hundreds of men and women to be accused of being involved in witchcraft.
Miller wrote the play as an allegory for McCarthyism, a time after World War II, when the government persecuted Americans who had been members of the Communist Party. Miller himself was found in contempt of Congress when he refused to give the House Committee on Un-American Activities the names of others who had attended party meetings.
[image id="2711889" size="full" pos="center" /]
Few community theater companies could mount a production of "The Crucible" as well executed as Midcoast has done. The play requires a large cast that ranges in age from teenagers to septuagenarians. It also is longer than today's average play, so pacing is critical to keep the attention of an audience.
The company and the designers beautifully execute Bannister's vision for the show. He wanted the characters to be "literally removing parts of their surroundings, ripping away at the fabric of the community," according to the program notes.
Set designer John Bielenberg and Bannister made sections of horizontal slats removable from the vertical boards that stand like pillars on stage. At key decision points in the story, sections of the set are removed, the way clapboards might be removed from a crumbling house. By the end of the play, little is left to protect the characters from the elements of nature or society.
Nathan Roach, well known for his performances with Midcoast and Ten Bucks Theatre Company in Bangor, plays John Proctor, the man who must decide whether to lie and live or keep his good name and die. Roach's tall, lanky physique and deep voice make him a natural choice for the role, but he has never been an actor to do as deep a dive into character he does in this production.
But Roach inhabits Proctor as he has no one else. The actor disappears into the passionate Proctor wracked with guilt over his affair with the teenaged Abigail and grief for the loss of his wife Elizabeth's affection.
In his scenes with Abigail, played by Emma Bishop, Proctor's lust rises off Roach like a heat wave. The audience can almost see it. But it is in the final moments of "The Crucible" that the actor truly shines. Roach makes Proctor's decision gut wrenching, heartbreaking and unforgettable.
[image id="2711888" size="full" pos="center" /]
As Elizabeth Proctor, Leah Bannister wears the woman's anguish over her husband's betrayal as if it were her apron. The actress gives a nuanced and layered performance but is especially good at chilling the heat coming off Roach with merely a glance. In her final scenes with him, Bannister shows how well Elizabeth knows her husband. She makes those moments so intimate, theatergoers feel as if they are intruding.
Emma Bishop's performance lacks the depth Roach and Bannister give the Proctors. Bishop does not bring Abigail's defiance to the surface often enough nor is her ability to manipulate the other girls portrayed as blatantly as it should be. The actress gives subtlety to the one character in the play who should be guileless.
Standout performers in "The Crucible' by supporting players include Erin Hayes as Mary Warren, Cory Burns as the Rev. Samuel Parris, Eric Sanders as Thomas Putnam, Bryan Hayes as the Rev. John Hale and Alison Cox as Rebecca Nurse. Jason Bannister, who replaced an ailing actor in the final week of rehearsal, gives a commanding performance as Deputy Gov. Danforth, the man who condemns many to death for witchcraft.
One of the technical elements that makes this production so moving is the sound, designed by Jay Rosenberg and the director. The combination of classical and modern music underscores the play's emotional depth. Yet, Bannister also uses silence to great effect, especially during the scenes between the Proctors.
Midcoast's production, combined with tragic current events, have made Miller's message more than timely. It is now urgent that his warning be heard anew and headed. "The Crucible" in Belfast is theater at its finest in nearly every way. It should not be missed.
"The Crucible" will be performed at 7:30 p.m Thursday through Saturday and at 2 p.m. Sunday at the Crosby Center, 96 Church St., Belfast. For more information, call 207-370-7592 or visit midcoastactors.org.
Editor's note: Judy Harrison portrayed Abigail in a 1969 production of "The Crucible" in Florissant, Missouri.

Texto completo: BUCKSPORT, Maine -- A man who barricaded himself at his U.S. Route 1 home was taken into custody Wednesday night.
The 57-year-old man surrendered without incident, a Bucksport Police Department dispatcher said.
A state police tactical team and negotiator had been on scene near 161 U.S. Route 1 for most of the day. The incident began at about noon, Town Manager Susan Lessard said. Bucksport Police Chief Sean Geagan was at the scene and did not respond to requests for comment.
The Bucksport Fire Department had Route 1 blocked at State Route 46 near Tradewinds Variety. Vehicles were routed into town through Route 46. Police had also blocked Route 1 near Nicholson Avenue in downtown.
Besides stopping traffic through one of Bucksport's busiest roads, the incident forced the closure of McDonald's and Subway restaurants and a U.S. Cellular store about a half-mile west of the scene. Business continued west of the restaurants at several gas stations and a Hannaford supermarket.

Texto completo: With profound sorrow and deep outrage, the Maine Council of Churches condemns the anti-Semitic act of hatred and lethal violence perpetrated on the worshiping congregation of Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh and extends our prayers, sympathy, support and solidarity to them and our Jewish siblings here in Maine.
Over the past two years, we have witnessed a disturbing increase in anti-Semitic bias incidents and hate crimes, and last weekend's shooting represents a horrifically predictable escalation along that despicable path as hate groups become more vocal, visible and violent. The council once again cautions against this growing and toxic culture of intolerance and bigotry that has infected our society. We call on our leaders -- religious, political and cultural -- to become agents and models of civility and compassion, upholding the dignity and rights of all people to live in peace.
And we, an organization of seven denominations representing 434 congregations and 55,000 congregants in Maine, call upon all faith communities in our state to stand in solidarity against all forms of religious, political and cultural prejudice and hatred; to rededicate ourselves to bringing peace, justice and hope to our broken world and its suffering people; and to join with all people of good will in offering our love, support and solidarity as we stand with and for our neighbors, near and far, who face hatred and discrimination.
In the words of The Interfaith Council of Contra Costa County, California, "Let us not allow the madness and hatred around us to become the world within us."
[Opinion: The only way to respond to the mass killing in Pittsburgh is with strength]
We encourage Maine's churches and people of faith to reach out to the Jewish communities in our midst to express compassion and commitment to them directly. We encourage everyone to attend vigils and religious services in the coming days to show we are all in this together and love will conquer hate.
At this sad time we are inspired by a prayer written by Rabbi Seth Goldstein after his temple in Olympia, Washington, was attacked in 2015:
"Our God and God of our ancestors, hate has been visited upon another community. Their sacred space has been violated. They feel vulnerable, afraid, angry and broken. So we pray to You:
"May strength come from our vulnerability, so we can support one another, and receive the support of others with gratitude and humility.
"May compassion come from our fear, so we do not act from that fear, and we can pursue justice not revenge, peace not more violence.
"May wisdom come from our anger, so we are able to see that an attack against us is an attack against all, and we are able to join in common cause with those who are similarly oppressed and targeted.
"And may healing come from our brokenness, so we are able to rise from this challenge with renewed life, commitment and connection.
"In light of this act of violence and hatred, we maintain our commitment [to] upholding the teachings and traditions of Your covenant, pursuing righteousness and compassion, justice and mercy, peace and understanding, love and friendship.
"May You frustrate those who seek to do harm and uphold those who seek to do good. May the shelter of Your peace spread over us and over all who dwell on earth.
"And let us say, 'Amen.'"
The Rev. Jane Field is executive director of the Maine Council of Churches.

Williams has been held at the Penobscot County Jail since his arrest. He currently is boarded out to the Two Bridges Regional Jail in Wiscasset.
Bangor police arrested Williams on Aug. 5 after he allegedly assaulted his 55-year-old ex-wife at her Merrimac Street apartment. Upstairs neighbors told police that they heard the woman screaming and went downstairs to try to help. At one point, the male neighbor threatened Williams with a gun and he left, according to court documents.
The victim told police that Williams tried to strangle her and threatened her with a knife. Court documents said that the victim had abrasions on her face, neck, arms and legs.
If convicted of the most serious charge of attempted murder, Williams faces up to 30 years in prison and a fine of up to $50,000.

Texto completo: A Waterville native and well-known former Maine basketball coach is under fire after a recording was posted online of the man apparently laying into a player with a profanity-laced tirade.
The recording has drawn condemnation from Maine athletes who were familiar with him when he was a successful club coach here, as well as former professional basketball player Rex Chapman, among others.
Mike Woodbury, who now runs the Nation Christian Academy in Florida, released a statement apologizing "for the vulgar language that was used."
[Sign up for our Sports newsletter]
"I have had this particular student for a year," he wrote in a statement posted to Twitter. "He is like family, and sometimes family arguments get blown out of proportion."
In the recording, Woodbury can apparently be heard calling an academy student athlete "retarded," "stupid ass" and other expletive-laden insults, as well as threatening to send him "back to Haiti."
"I control transcripts. I control where you go next," his voice is heard saying. "I'm the one thing you don't wanna cross, cause I'm the dirtiest, baddest (expletive) on this earth."
Woodbury said in his statement the recording was an excerpt of a much longer conversation, which took place on Oct. 17, in which he is confronting the player about "multiple conduct issues when this student was attending my school and living in my home with my wife and son." Woodbury said in his statement he is not the academy's basketball coach.
Isaiah Harris of Lewiston, now an NCAA champion in track who is sponsored by athletic apparel giant Nike, said on Twitter that he played for Woodbury's AAU team when he was in high school.
"Everyone always knew he was insane," Harris wrote, in part. "This is how you run your 'Christian Academy?'"
Chapman, who played 12 years in the NBA, slammed Woodbury in a series of Tweets, calling the tirade " sickening" and the former coach's subsequent apology " a joke."
Woodbury's AAU club basketball team from Maine won the Division I 12th grade national championship in Orlando in 2011, according to the Portland Press Herald. At the time, Woodbury also ran a year-round basketball training facility in Saco, the newspaper reported.

Texto completo: Gregory Nisbet, the landlord sent to jail for his role in Maine's deadliest house fire in decades, was released Wednesday -- one day shy of the fourth anniversary of the blaze that killed six.
"It's a strange coincidence," said Luke Rioux, the lawyer who has represented Nisbet during the later stages of the drawn-out legal process that rose from the ashes of a rented Portland home.
Nisbet served 70 days of his 90-day sentence for a misdemeanor code violation, a typical term under Maine policy that allows inmates to be released early for earned "good time," Rioux said.
[Landlord not guilty of manslaughter in Maine's deadliest house fire in decades]
Save statements in court during the 2016 criminal trial in which he was acquitted of six counts of manslaughter, Nisbet has remained largely silent since the fire. In a written statement released through his lawyer Wednesday, he expressed "tremendous sadness."
"To say that Greg thinks of those young lives every day is an understatement," Rioux said. "The tragedy and the loss of life is with him constantly though everything he does."
The fire that consumed 20 Noyes St. in the early hours of Nov. 1, 2014, was was kindled by a stray cigarette butt. It killed David Bragdon Jr., 27; Ashley Thomas, 29; and Nicole Finlay, 26 -- who lived at 20 Noyes St. -- as well as Maelisha Jackson, 23, of Topsham; Steven Summers, 29, of Rockland; and Chris Conlee, 25, of Portland, who were visiting that night.
[Two years after the deadly Portland fire, two little girls learn the truth of how their father died]
Holding landlords criminally responsible for fires at their properties is rare, and a judge ultimately found Nisbet not guilty on all but one count. He was convicted of a fire code violation for the windows on the third floor of his building -- where three people where found dead -- being too small to provide a second means of escape.
At the time of the trial, the father of one of the young men who died said he saw no justice in the sole conviction.
[Landlord's $45k settlement for deadly Maine fire called 'wholly inadequate']
A year after the fire, Portland City Council voted unanimously to create a housing safety office, which keeps a registry of rental properties and employs several full-time housing inspectors to enforce housing safety code.
But years later, city staff are still finding scores of rental homes and apartments that do not meet code across Maine's largest city.
Since January 2017, when the city reorganized the housing safety office and began specifically tracking such units, inspectors have found code violations in converted garages, finished basements, top-floor apartments and other spaces, totaling to 81 "illegal" units at 72 properties, a city official said in September.
[Maine's largest city still finding scores of 'illegal' apartments]
In his statement, Nisbet said he hopes his experience will be a "wake-up call to landlords, property managers, contractors, homeowners, and others that we all need to know the building life and safety code and ensure full compliance."

Texto completo: A young hunter from Bucksport ended up with an adventure to remember over the weekend as he dealt with foul weather, a few fruitless sessions afield and an unsuccessful search for a deer before finding a buck with a striking set of antlers.
Christian Winslow, 16, checked in via email on Monday to share his tale and some photos. He spent a few hours in the woods at different times, spending a couple hours in a tree stand early in the morning, returning to help his grandfather stack wood, then heading back out for another hour with his mom.
No deer appeared during either effort.
Winslow said he then spent the bulk of the day watching the high school cross-country state championships before returning to Bucksport for an afternoon hunt.

He sat between a pair of fields near his home that seemed promising. Mother Nature wasn't cooperating, though.
"It was raining the entire time, and I didn't have any shelter," Winslow said. "I got out of where I was sitting [after an hour and a half], went up to the house and got the hunting blind as soon as I sat in it, two does and two lambs popped up in the big field."
Winslow watched those deer for a half-hour, before two more deer appeared, joining about 50 turkeys.
"Then, around 5:30, a six-point buck walked up in the middle of the big field, too far away for me to get a good shot. He's only there for about three minutes before he goes into the back field where my mom is hunting," Winslow wrote.
Then things became really interesting.
"About 20 minutes after the six-point left the field, I look back into the first field. [A] giant [11-point] non-typical buck flies down from the top of the hill and goes right next to the tree line," he wrote.
Winslow took the shot, and about a minute later, heard three more shots from where his mother was hunting. Later he learned that she'd missed the six-pointer.
Winslow, however, didn't miss. But after getting his grandfather, Ron Gross, and his mom, Rebekah Noble, involved in the search, the group spent the next few hours trying to find the buck.
"We stayed out looking until around 9 p.m., when my grandfather said we should go in because it was too rainy and dark to search," Winslow wrote. "During the entire time it was pouring rain, and I was soaked to the skin. I probably gained 10 pounds of water."
With a plan to resume searching Sunday morning, Winslow dried off, watched the Boston Red Sox for a bit, and turned in.
After a short search in daylight, Winslow's effort paid off: He found the buck 30 yards from the spot the previous night's search had ended, and about a quarter of a mile from where the deer was when he was shot.
The deer wasn't huge -- he weighed 155 pounds, field-dressed -- but had an impressive, if odd, 11-point rack.
Winslow said he was pleased that he was able to find the deer, which was hardly a stranger to him.
"I've been watching him on the trail camera for months," Winslow wrote. "I'm so happy I didn't lose him."
Nathan Bieber, the state deer biologist for the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife, had a theory about the rack, which featured what he called a "split main beam" on the right side.
"It looks as though both beams come out of the same pedicle," Bieber said. "[I] can't really say for sure what caused this, but injury to the pedicle would be my prime suspect with this deer. Other bodily injuries and genetics can cause antlers to develop in strange ways as well. Very cool rack."

Texto completo: A Whiting man awaiting trial at the Washington County Jail on charges of gross sexual assault, robbery and burglary is facing additional charges, according to the Maine Department of Public Safety.
Robert Boggia, 33, was charged Tuesday with conspiracy to commit murder and arson, Stephen McCausland, spokesman for the department, said Wednesday.
"Maine State Police troopers, working with the Washington sheriff's office and the Maine Drug Enforcement Agency, received new information in the past week that Boggia wanted to kill a witness involved in his case," McCausland said. "In addition, fire investigators say they have developed a case against him following a fire at his former home in Blue Hill in 2013."
The house was destroyed in the blaze.
Boggia has been unable to post $50,000 cash bail since his arrest Feb. 16 following a manhunt for him in Washington and Hancock counties, according to media reports.
He is expected to make his first court appearance Thursday or Friday at the Washington County Judicial Center in Machias.
If Boggia is convicted of either conspiracy to commit murder or arson, both Class A crimes, he faces up to 30 years in prison and a fine of up to $50,000.

What to expect Election Day

Texto completo: Recently, I had dinner with three very informed, intelligent, politically savvy friends, all of whom -- just for the record -- happen to be Democrats. Naturally the conversation drifted toward Election Day, and the same question that I have been asked thousands of times this year, and thousands of times in each of the preceding election years, was again asked of me.
"So, what do you think is going to happen?"
I answered, of course. Everyone else at the table answered too, but what those answers sounded like was incredibly varied. Indeed, on several questions, we had four people with four different opinions of how things would go.
"Alright," someone began, "who do you think wins the gubernatorial race?"
"Shawn Moody."
"Janet Mills, but only by a little."
"I think Janet wins walking away. Blowout."
"I legitimately don't have the slightest idea."
This same back and forth continued as we laid out our predictions in Maine's 1st and 2nd Congressional Districts, the Maine Senate, the Maine House, Question 1 and races with national significance.
But no matter the answers we gave, each and every one of us had a lack of confidence in that opinion. We all agreed, despite what we were each predicting, that we wouldn't be surprised if we ended up wrong.
Political prognosticators like to pretend like they have secret knowledge that allows them unique understanding of political trends, which makes them worthy of listening to as they predict outcomes.
Most of the time, they are blowhards who sit comfortably in their ivory towers of punditry, disconnected entirely from the voting public, regurgitating a stale and uninteresting version of conventional wisdom. When they get things right, it is because that conventional wisdom happened to be accidentally correct that year.
In the coming days, you'll hear a lot of predictions about what will happen, and you should take none of them very seriously.
To explain why, indulge me as I recount for you the parable of the blind men and the elephant.
The story recounts how a group of blind men heard tale of a strange animal that had come to town, called an elephant. None knew what an elephant was or what it looked like, so the men sought out the elephant, and demanded to inspect it by touch.
The first man touched the trunk. The second man touched its ear. The third touched its leg. The fourth touched its side. The fifth, its tusk.
When asked, the first man described the elephant as snake-like. The second man believed it to be like a fan. The third thought it was similar to a tree. The fourth believed it was like a wall. The fifth believed it was like a spear.
The point to the story, of course, is that our own limited exposure to the totality of something shows us only part of the whole. We do not get the entire picture, and fill the gaps in our knowledge with assumptions based on our own limited experience.
Those of us who follow and talk about politics are no different. We live in the bubbles of our own limited experience.
When I ask my Democratic friends, I hear of internal poll numbers showing a double-digit wipeout of this candidate or that. When I ask my Republican friends I hear optimism about everything, with internal poll numbers showing a small lead in a number of close races.
Both say the same thing, "when we are out there talking to voters, we feel real momentum and enthusiasm, and I am really optimistic." Both are being entirely truthful, because both are blind, touching only one part of the elephant.
Sometimes, some of them end up right. Sometimes some of them end up wrong. However right or wrong they are, it is more coincidence than anything else, which makes the actual value of predictions quite low.
So what should we expect on Election Day? Your guess is as good as mine.

Texto completo: In a late flurry before Election Day, the three candidates in this year's U.S. Senate contest participated in two debates on Tuesday.
Maine Public hosted an afternoon debate, followed a few hours later by the third televised Senate debate this week, sponsored by WGME and co-moderated by the BDN's Michael Shepherd.
U.S. Sen. Angus King, I-Maine, is favored to retain his seat for a second six-year term. He is being challenged by Republican state Sen. Eric Brakey of Auburn and Democrat Zak Ringelstein of Yarmouth.
The three tussled over immigration, gun control, Chinese tariffs, trade policy and health care, as well as a controversial tweet of Brakey's that was criticized in Portland Press Herald editorial Monday for fanning the conspiracy-theory flame on immigration. Brakey was also asked about his position on Trump's desire to sign an executive order to essentially alter the Constitution and end automatic citizenship for children born in the U.S. to undocumented immigrants.
When pressed, Brakey explained why he believes an executive order from Trump to rewrite the 14th Amendment would be lawful or appropriate.
"It's not just enough to be born here," Brakey said, claiming that children born in the U.S. to illegal immigrants "aren't really here under our jurisdiction." Suggesting otherwise "devalues" our citizenship process, he said.
King sharply disagreed, saying, "Anybody born here and living here is subject to the jurisdiction of the state. As a conservative, how can you possibly support a president who's saying he can amend the Constitution?"
Ringelstein said the president "wants to take us off the cliff of authoritarianism."
Otherwise, Tuesday night's debate was a reprise of earlier forums in which Brakey ripped King from the right while Ringelstein jabbed from the left. All three candidates will convene Thursday on WMTW-TV for their last debate.

Maine Democrats parlay public financing to big campaign cash advantage

Texto completo: Democrats are outspending Republicans by a historic margin in Maine legislative races in 2018 as they seek to win control of both chambers for the first time in six years -- though plenty of battlegrounds remain, particularly in the Maine Senate.
Legislative races are often overshadowed and they have been particularly this year because of the intense national interest in Maine's 2nd Congressional District and the open-seat governor's race. But the makeup of the Legislature will set the tenor for the next governor's administration.
In the Senate, Republicans hold the slimmest possible 18-17 majority. Democrats have only a plurality in the House, but they're in control of the lower chamber 73-70 over Republicans with seven other members who generally lean Democrats' way as a group.
Republicans are used to being outspent in legislative races, but this year is different. In the last five legislative cycles from 2008 to 2016, Democrats have generally used an edge in outside money to outspend Republicans in legislative races. In 2018, the candidates are also spending more and management of the taxpayer-funded Clean Election program is a major reason why.
In both chambers, Democrats have spent just over 69 percent of the campaign money and outside money that has come into legislative races this year. From 2008 to 2016, their overall edge by that measure was 55 percent -- a gap that often has proven manageable for them.
The added outside money is helping Democrats in competitive races. In the Senate, the biggest race by outside money is the one between Assistant House Minority Leader Ellie Espling, R-New Gloucester, and physician Ned Claxton of Auburn, which drew $340,000 according to data available Tuesday night -- 75 percent of that from Democratic groups.
In the House, seven races have drawn at least $20,000 in outside money. Four have Republican incumbents, three have Democratic incumbents and one seat is open. The priciest race is in Skowhegan between Rep. Betty Austin, a Democrat, and Republican Anne Amadon. Democrats are outspending Republicans in each one.
Those highest-spending Senate campaigns are being driven by taxpayer money. Some of those candidates will likely come up short. The 12 highest spenders are using the Clean Election system -- which was disabled by Gov. Paul LePage for part of the campaign -- and 10 of them are Democrats to just one Republican and one independent.
Most of them are candidates in toss-up races, including both House Majority Leader Erin Herbig, D-Belfast, and her opponent, former state Rep. Jayne Crosby Giles, R-Belfast. Claxton is third at just over $65,000 in campaign spending while Espling has spent just over $18,000.
But they also include longer shots, including Democrat Jan Collins of Wilton, running against Rep. Russell Black, R-Wilton, in a long-red district and independent Crystal Canney of Portland, who is facing Sen. Ben Chipman, D-Portland, in the state's bluest district. Sen. Jim Dill, D-Old Town, has spent $50,000 in a race with Maia Dendinger, a Maine Socialist Party candidate from Orono running as an independent.
There are still pick-up opportunities for Republicans, though mapping their road to victory in the House is difficult. All of this money, a likely Democratic-leaning national environment and a higher number of termed-out Republicans probably gives Democrats the edge in both chambers.
However, we also said that in 2016. Senate Republicans clung to a majority and House Republicans gained seats. In the Senate, Republicans have a few crucial pick-up opportunities that could decide whether or not they hang on. They include the race between Sen. Michael Carpenter, D-Houlton, and Republican Kathy Reynolds of Houlton.
It seems to be a harder road for Republicans in the more volatile House, where Democrats are sinking the most money into southern Maine districts that were generally unkind to President Donald Trump while defending some incumbents in rural seats, including Austin and Rep. Seth Berry, D-Bowdoinham, who is running against Republican Guy Lebida of Bowdoin.

Susan Collins pours cold water on Trump’s birthright citizenship move: 'Courts would rule against'

Texto completo: PHOENIX — Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, believes it is possible to craft a narrow bill to deal with birthright citizenship, but does not believe an executive order by the president would past muster with the courts.

In an interview Wednesday, Collins, a centrist, said that she isn't sure how willing the Senate will be to take up the issue after the midterm elections or in the next Congress come January. She pointed to abuses of the system, particularly by the Chinese sending women over to the U.S. to have babies, as something that could be on the negotiating table in legislation.

"There may be an opportunity to carefully craft some narrowly tailored legislation to get at the abuses that clearly are occurring," Collins said in an interview while in Arizona to campaign for Rep. Martha McSally, R-Ariz.

"I'm not certain what the appetite is in the Senate for dealing with this issue. I do know that there are some clear abuses," Collins said, referring to China. "That obviously is an abuse. But I am also cognizant of the fact that the 14th Amendment to the Constitution is pretty clear that if you are born in America, with some explicit exceptions, you are an American citizen."

"I am skeptical that the president would be able to change that through an executive order. I don't think he can," Collins said. "It would almost certainly be challenged in court, and I believe the courts would rule against the president as far as his ability to bring about that change through an executive order."

Collins' comments came a day after the president said in an interview that he could make changes to birthright citizenship through executive order. She said in Maine Tuesday that she "completely disagree[s]" with the president's assertion.

Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., one of the most ardent backers of ending birthright citizenship, said shortly after the president's remarks were revealed that he plans to introduce legislation backing the president's call.

Trump administration approves Wisconsin Medicaid work requirement

Texto completo: Wisconsin will begin requiring people on Medicaid to work or train for work as a condition of staying enrolled in the program, despite a legal battle in Arkansas over a similar program.

The Trump administration approved a Medicaid waiver for the state on Wednesday, with Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Seema Verma calling it a program to "achieve independence and self-sufficiency."

The approval came even though a lawsuit knocked down a similar provision in Kentucky and another suit is pending in Arkansas.

Wisconsinites will need to work for 80 hours a month to maintain benefits, and if they fail to do so for 48 months in a row, then they will be locked out of Medicaid for at least six months.

Critics of work requirements say that they are a thinly-veiled attempt to kick people off the healthcare program. Supporters say that work helps to reduce government dependency and that the program's goal should be to move people out of poverty.

“With more people working in Wisconsin than ever before, we can’t afford to have anyone on the sidelines: We need everyone in the game,” GOP Gov. Scott Walker said in a statement. “We want to remove barriers to work and make it easier to get a job, while making sure public assistance is available for those who truly need it."

The waiver includes a requirement for certain people to pay premiums, of about $8 a month, and also to pay out-of-pocket costs of $8 when they go to the emergency room for care. Under the Medicaid program, people would undergo a health risk assessment that will include asking about drug use.

The plan will cover residential treatment for substance abuse disorder, and people will be able to reduce their premiums by making healthy lifestyle choices such as wearing a seatbelt, maintaining a healthy weight, and not smoking.

Verma praised these provisions in the waiver, saying, "As we evaluate their results, I expect these reforms may serve as a model for states looking to tackle the drivers of poor health and improve outcomes for individuals.”

Under Obamacare, states were allowed to expand government-funded Medicaid coverage to people of under specific income level, of roughly $17,000 a year, regardless of whether they are working. Medicaid otherwise covers pregnant women, people with disabilities, people in nursing homes, and children, a group that members of the Trump administration and conservatives say should remain the focus of the program.

Though the work requirements contain multiple exemptions for people undergoing treatment for addiction and for caregivers, among other groups, critics say people will be unable to keep up with the reporting requirements and become uninsured. They have said that tracking the work requirement is more expensive than healthcare coverage.

Four months into the work requirement program in Arkansas, 8,462 people were unenrolled from Medicaid after failing to log their hours online. State officials said some people had moved to another state or obtained a job, while others had failed to fulfill the requirement.

The Trump administration has supported Arkansas-style requirements, though one program was put on hold in Kentucky after a legal challenge. The Trump administration faces a similar lawsuit in Arkansas.

At least seven other states — Arizona, Kansas, Maine, Mississippi, North Carolina, Ohio, and Utah — have pending requests for similar work requirements.

Once a political punching bag, small Obamacare insurers chug along

Texto completo: When Obamacare’s marketplaces went online in 2014, the Obama administration created 23 small insurers to boost competition on the law’s insurance exchanges.

Of those 23, only four now remain.

Their demise became a political talking point for Republicans, who claimed that the collapse was evidence of Obamacare’s failure. But the remaining insurers, called consumer oriented and operated plans, or co-ops, say that they are stable and will offer plans in 2019 and that they are fulfilling the original goal of boosting competition, if only for a few states.

A vast majority of co-ops closed in rapid succession back in 2015 and 2016. They failed for a variety of reasons, ranging from insufficient federal funding to misjudgment about who would sign up for Obamacare when the exchanges went online in 2014.

When the majority of co-ops collapsed, Republicans in Congress argued that their failures presaged a “death spiral” that would collapse the entire individual market, in which people who don't get insurance through their jobs or the government buy policies, and which is served by Obamacare’s insurance exchanges.

The four remaining co-ops are New Mexico Health Connections; Mountain Healthcare, covering Idaho and Montana; Community Health Options of Maine; and Common Ground in Wisconsin. Of the four co-ops contacted by the Washington Examine r, two of them returned a request for comment: Mountain Healthcare and Health Connections.

All four will offer plans in 2019.

Obamacare’s exchanges are entering the 2019 coverage year with signs of stability. Some insurers are re-entering the market after previously suffering financial losses and leaving. The Trump administration said that it expects premiums to decline slightly next year.

“In Idaho we have taken away some market share from the big legacy [insurance] companies and the same here in Montana,” said Richard Miltenberger, president and CEO of Mountain Health. “They take us as a serious threat.”

Mountain Health’s premiums are expected to rise by 10 percent in 2019 in Montana, and the co-op covers about 22,700 residents in the state. In Idaho, the insurer will raise rates by 7 percent.

New Mexico Health Connections also said that it has worked to boost competition on the exchanges.

“We are happy to say that our New Mexico Health Connections’ rates for 2019 have seen a decline,” said spokeswoman Joanie Griffin, referring to a 2 percent decline in its 2019 rates.

A major reason several co-ops failed was that a sicker-than-expected enrollee population signed up for
Obamacare. Obamacare insurers also generally priced their plans too low in 2014 and couldn’t keep up with the high medical claims that arose from the enrollees who signed up.

The result was that small insurance startups couldn’t keep up with the high claims and ran out of money, while larger insurers could cushion the blow.

Miltenberger said that the insurer has been able to stay stable because it built slowly.

“The folks who preceded me were very wise and made a point of not growing too quickly and didn’t become technically insolvent by outgrowing their capital,” said Miltenberger, who has helmed the insurer since May of this year.

But another key factor in the co-ops' early struggles was the ineffectiveness of federal programs to help prop up insurers to help them adjust to the new Obamacare marketplace.

For instance, the program called risk adjustment forces insurers who make profits above a certain threshold pay the federal government, which in turn distributes those funds to insurers that make a certain amount of losses. The goal is to spread around risk among Obamacare insurers.

However, New Mexico Health Connections has sued the federal government multiple times on the grounds that the formula used to determine payments into the program was flawed.

The co-op cited several other co-ops that shut down due in part to the risk-adjustment program. HealthyCT, a co-op based in Connecticut, shut down after having to pay $13 million in risk-adjustment payments in 2015, and the Illinois co-op Land of Lincoln Health had to pay $32 million in risk-adjustment payments.

Open enrollment for Obamacare starts on Nov. 1 and runs through Dec. 15 on healthcare.gov, which is used by 38 states for residents to buy Obamacare plans. The deadline for the end of open enrollment will vary among the remaining 12 state-run exchanges.

Texto completo: PORTLAND, Maine (AP) — Horror writer Stephen King is giving a deal to student filmmakers at the Blaenau Gwent Film Academy in Wales.
King sold them the movie rights to a short story, "Stationary Bike," for $1.
Kevin Phillips, a tutor at the school, tells The Boston Globe the deal is "great for our students who are fans of his writing and a great scoop for the academy."
The story is about a man who begins using a stationary bike after his doctor tells him to lose weight because of high cholesterol. He gets in shape but begins "having strange thoughts" about being followed on his daily rides.
Marsha DeFilippo, King's assistant, said the Maine author has a program in which students receive permission to make a noncommercial film.

Hed: True Troupe to stage "Love/Sick" play next weekend at LCCC CQ: Adrianna True, Kiersten Cussins If you go What: A production of "Love/Sick" by John Cariani When: Sept. 28-29, 7:30 p.m. Where: Playhouse, Laramie County Community College, 1400 E. College Drive Cost: $10 Online: Search "Love/Sick by John Cariani" on Facebook for more information.

By Ellen Fike Wyoming Tribune Eagle For the second show being staged by her new theater troupe, director and producer Adrianna True wanted to pick something with a topic anyone could relate to. So she turned to one of her favorite playwrights, John Cariani. The writer had penned a play called "Almost, Maine," which is one of True's most-loved works. It focuses on nine tales of people experiencing love and loss in the fictional town of Almost, Maine. That show was a little more lighthearted than what True was looking for. But she was in luck. Cariani also had a show called "Love/Sick," which True noted was essentially the same play as "Almost, Maine," without the magical realism elements of the latter, making it more realistic, yet darker too. "When I read 'Love/Sick,' all I could think was how I had to get this show into my repertoire," True said. "I didn't care when it would happen, though. But I found out that I could squeeze it into our schedule fairly early, so I made sure to do that. I wanted to get it out there into the world." Since she's such a fan of Cariani's works, she decided to create a send-up to him by staging "Love/Sick" at Laramie County Community College. The True Troupe's production will take place next weekend inside the college's playhouse. Tickets are on sale for $10 each. True described the show as a "circular play," one that consists of nine short scenes that are connected by a theme, but not necessarily by story. All of the vignettes are around the same length, with the performance running around two hours. "You get to see nine plays for the price of one," True joked. "This is such an interesting show. The overarching theme is about heartbreak, loss and uncertainty. It also focuses on the uncomfortability of change, which is something I wanted to convey. It's an uncomfortable show, but it still has a resolve at the end." Actress Kiersten Cussins worked on the troupe's last show, "A Midsummer Night's Dream," and fell in love with working with True during that time. When the director began discussing the upcoming show, Cussins knew she had to be involved again. But the theme of love and heartbreak was something that drew her in, as well. "I feel like I understand this theme pretty well," she said. "But I wanted to learn more about it. I experienced my first real heartbreak last year, which helped me prepare for this show. Since working on this play, though, I feel like I've learned even more about it, by seeing depictions of couples going through a divorce or breaking up."

EXPLAINED: WISCONSIN'S ATTORNEY GENERAL; POLITICS

Texto completo: In just over a week, Wisconsin voters will face a ballot asking them to choose, among other things, the state's next attorney general.
Attorney general races often have a lower profile, garnering less media coverage and public attention than gubernatorial or congressional races.
Yet the role is one of the most significant in the executive branch and wields sizable prosecutorial discretion and influence over citizens' lives. Attorneys general nationwide are also becoming more active on a national level, banding together to advance cases challenging federal policy. The position came out of England and became a part of state governments after the Revolutionary War. They were designed to be independent, keeping states apart from the federal government.
In this year's race, incumbent Republican Attorney General Brad Schimel is facing Democratic challenger attorney Josh Kaul. The latest Marquette Law School Poll on Oct. 10 gave Schimel a four-point edge. The next poll, the last before the Nov. 6 election, comes out Wednesday.
Zack Roday of the Republican Attorneys General Association and Lizzie Ulmer of the Democratic Attorneys General Association answered questions about what the attorney general does and why it matters.
What are the core functions of the AGs office?
Roday: "The Wisconsin Department of Justice is the state law enforcement agency with the attorney general serving as the top cop. The AG impacts every single person in Wisconsin from a general perspective, partnering with local, state and federal law enforcement to keep communities safe to the specific: going after pill pushers and elder abuse violators."
Ulmer: "An Attorney general's core function is to be the lawyer for the people. Regardless of race, religion, sexual orientation, gender, ability, socioeconomic status a good AG is the leader you can trust to protect you. Although the specific powers and jurisdiction of state attorneys general very widely state to state, a good attorney general is on the front lines of protecting the families and communities in their state. For example, state attorneys general may bring consumer protection actions, operate victim compensation programs, sponsor state legislation that protects natural resources in their state, or file lawsuits against bad actors for violating the Constitution."
Why is this role relevant to a Wisconsin residents life?
Roday: "The AG is leading the fight against the opioid epidemic a scourge impacting the entire state so it's critically important to have the right person in the job."
Ulmer: "Attorneys general are the only elected officials with the drive and the power to protect our democracy and hold others accountable. If people care about health care, protecting the Dreamers, workers' rights, keeping the internet fair and open, preventing gun violence, tackling the opioid crisis, safeguarding natural resources, protecting reproductive rights, protecting victims of sexual assault, then they need to pay attention to the AG race."
The governor and Senate races are taking up a lot of attention.
Why should people pay attention to the AG race in Wisconsin and vote in it?
Roday: "People want their government to keep them safe and to be fair. The AG is the ultimate protector they keep our schools and streets safe. And an AG must defend the law regardless of political preference to ensure fairness. We (RAGA) conducted focus groups with voters in both Green Bay and Milwaukee, separate groups with men and women. The participants were active voters who were undecided in the AG race and do not strongly identify as either Republicans or Democrats but are independent. Two points here experience and trust. Folks were able to identify Brad Schimel as attorney general, but few knew specifics about the role of the attorney general except those with a law enforcement background, awareness."
Ulmer: "This matters to the people of Wisconsin because if you elect a good AG one that is committed to putting people first they will protect the most vulnerable and marginalized members of their state and keep residents safe."
So what does an attorney general do, day-to-day?
It varies state by state, but in Wisconsin, the attorney general leads the state Department of Justice, which employs more than 800 people including about 200 attorneys. Attorneys general are also the lawyers for state government, so they defend the state if it gets sued. They also take enforcement actions, which would include a lawsuit against other entities, on behalf of the state.
The attorney general can also issue a formal opinion as to what the law should be to guide state agencies or lawmakers.
The attorney general also has criminal jurisdiction, so he or she prosecutes high-level criminal cases that might be referred to DOJ from county district attorneys or come to the agency from appellate courts. Day to day, the attorney general could work on all of these cases with assistant attorneys general at DOJ. The attorney general could also work on developing task forces to address specific issues and work with lawmakers to develop legislation on legal or criminal justice issues. He or she might also travel the state to work with local law enforcement agencies and district attorneys on certain criminal justice issues.
Where can I go to read more about the role of AGs generally and what other policy issues does the o.ce cover?
StateAG.org is an educational website created by former Maine Attorney General James Tierney, who lectures on attorneys general at Harvard Law School and led the National State Attorneys General Program at Columbia Law School. The site offers research on policy areas attorneys general address. According to the site, StateAG.org works with state attorneys general staff throughout the country to build alliances with state agencies and nonprofit organizations to address legal and policy issues facing state government.

OUR FUTURE DEPENDS ON DECISIVE DEMOCRATIC VICTORY

Texto completo: I've often heard people say "I vote for the person not the party." I respect that perspective, especially from folks well informed about the candidates.
However, this is not the year for that approach. In this election, it is essential that Republicans be defeated from top to bottom from governor and senator all the way down the ballot. Our democracy and our future depend on a decisive rejection of Donald Trump and the party that has become subservient to him. I say this not because Democrats don't have an excellent slate of candidates in Wisconsin. Just the opposite. Tony Evers is a strong advocate for kids and public education and is a person of unsurpassed principle, honesty and competence. Tammy Baldwin has a deep sense of compassion and is a fierce and effective fighter for Wisconsin interests. Josh Kaul would make an outstanding attorney general, bringing his background as a tough federal prosecutor and advocate for voting rights to a Department of Justice in great need of reform.
I also do not say this because Democrats lack a positive vision. Again, the opposite is true. Democratic candidates are campaigning for affordable health care, a clean environment, quality education, investment in infrastructure, respect for constitutional rights and good-paying jobs.
I say this because Donald Trump is a threat to our American values. The Republican Party, with shockingly few exceptions, has been unwilling to hold him accountable.
We now face the greatest challenge to our freedoms in many decades. If this election does not deal a resounding blow to Trump and his Republican accomplices, do not expect more of the same from Trump. Rather, expect Trumpism on steroids. He will feel empowered to push his brand of anti-democratic nationalism to new heights.
The underlying principles of the free world a free press, the right to vote, an independent justice system, opposition to dictatorship, and a rejection of violence in settling political disputes are under attack.
Trump's vitriolic rhetoric against the free press is well known, praising and inciting violent attacks on journalists. Trump has repeatedly attacked the independence of the Justice Department and threatened the independent prosecutor, Robert Mueller. It's very likely that if the Republicans retain control of Congress, Mueller will be fired and Republican politicians will say little if anything in opposition.
Republicans have undermined the right to vote in state after state. For example, the Republican candidate for governor of Georgia, Brian Kemp, is actually overseeing his own election. That candidate has blocked registrations of 53,000 voters, most of whom are African-American. An unprecedented number of absentee ballots in racially diverse precincts have been thrown out. Republican officials there went so far as to stop a busload of elderly African-Americans who were on their way to vote.
In North Dakota, Republicans passed a law that effectively revokes the right to vote for tens of thousands of Indians on reservations. In Kansas, as in Georgia, the Republican gubernatorial candidate is overseeing his own election. In that state, in order to hold down voter participation, a city of 28,000 with a large Latino population has been restricted to having just one polling place and that one polling place has been moved to a location a considerable distance outside the city.
In the face of this attack on American values and the norms of democracy, Republican politicians have been either silent or willing accomplices. Even the few who occasionally offer some timid words of concern, like Susan Collins of Maine, are easily intimidated to fall quickly in line.
With Trump threatening our democracy and Republicans unwilling to perform their duty as a check and balance, we have only one option. The Republicans must be decisively defeated. Make sure you vote on Nov. 6 (or earlier if you can) and vote Democratic all the way. Our American values and future depend upon it.

Texto completo: The coach gaining national attention for a recording of him berating players recently coached basketball in Maine.
Late Tuesday, an audio clip was posted on YouTube of Mike “Woody” Woodbury, owner and CEO of Nation Christian Academy in Port St. Lucie, Florida, shouting obscene phrases to his players on the Nation Christian Academy team.
Woodbury was the owner of the Maine AAU basketball team MB Nation, based in Saco, before leaving in 2015. Maine players who played for and against Woodbury say his behavior in the audio clip is nothing new.
Some of the most pointed phrases in the recording were to Nation Christian Academy player Marven Petion in which Woodbury threatened to send Petion back to Haiti.
“I control your transfers, I control where you go next, it could be back to Haiti, motherf—,” Woodbury said to Petion. “That’s how easy it is for me. … I am the dirtiest, baddest motherf— in this Earth.”
Jeff Goodman of Stadium, an online sports page, reported that Petion has since transferred but was surprised to find that his transcripts showed he had maintained a 1.4 grade-point average. Petion said he had held a B average while at Nation Christian Academy.

Taylor Schildroth, a graduate of George Stevens Academy and 2018 Maine Mr. Basketball finalist, had enrolled this fall at Nation Christian but transferred after the video surfaced.
“The incident did not directly involve me,” Schildroth said. “I’ve made the decision to leave the school because I don’t want to be associated with a school whose leader says things like that.”
Woodbury has always had a Maine connection. In the early 2000s, he coached a 15U AAU girls’ basketball team called Maine Elite before starting up MB Nation.
“The recording was a perfect description of his everyday behavior,” Emily Rousseau, a Maine Elite player, said Wednesday.
Rousseau and teammate Tanna Ross, who played under Woodbury from seventh grade through her sophomore year of high school, said that Woodbury would frequently yell obscenities at the players, including racially tinged threats at a black player on the team.

“I remember him making a comment to an African-American player that if she didn’t play better he would commit a hate crime,” Rousseau said.
“He was very racist to her and demeaning over and over,” Ross said.
Ross said Woodbury “just liked to control every situation we were in,” and had “very controlling tendencies.”
In the audio clip posted Tuesday night, Woodbury made reference to his control over the players.
He threatened sexual assault “next time you talk out of line. I’m going to take everything from you. I am going to end everything you’ve ever had.”

MAINE ELITE
During his time with Maine Elite, Woodbury was frequently swearing, demeaning his players and sometimes being sexually suggestive, according to a complaint filed with the AAU by Pamela Barker in 2005 that has been obtained by the Sun Journal. Barker is a parent of two of Woodbury’s Maine Elite players.
“Things like what they did/do with their boyfriends, if they even had boyfriends, what their sexual habits might be,” Barker said. “If you were a player who had a boyfriend, you were considered a ‘sperm bank,’ and he inquired about one of his player’s sexual orientation on more than one occasion.”
The “sperm bank” phrase was used frequently toward his team of girls age 15 and younger.
Parents were concerned, again, when Woodbury was found watching movies with the girls in a hotel room wearing only gym shorts and with no other adult supervision, according to the complaint.

“There was no way that I felt comfortable enough to send my girls on their own on any of these ill-supervised trips,” Barker said.
During practices, Rousseau remembers being physically moved by Woodbury.
“Even though he didn’t hit anyone, he was still very physical,” Rousseau said. “If he wanted us to go onto the court, he would drag us by our ponytail. If he wanted you to move, he would physically grab you and push you and not punch, but use a firm fist to the stomach.”
MB NATION AND BEYOND
Woodbury went on to start MB Nation after all players on the Maine Elite team quit, including Rousseau and Ross.

Woodbury’s reputation followed him, however, and his antics never changed.
“Parents tolerated his actions because kids were playing college basketball and landing scholarships,” said Nicholas Jobin, a former Westbrook High School player and opponent of Woodbury’s on the AAU circuit. “But it reached a tipping point. He needed a fresh start and Florida was the perfect opportunity to him.”
Jobin played against Woodbury before Jobin graduated in 2010 and Woodbury was already considered a bully.
Jobin said he’s talked to many people recently who have had interactions with Woodbury over the years, and many agree that the recording that surfaced Tuesday was normal for him.
When 2013 Edward Little High School graduate Quin Leary played against Jobin’s teams, he remembers a physically and verbally abusive coach.

“He was like that every time I played against him, always yelling and belittling his players,” Leary said. “He would scream and call them p—s, a bunch of 13- and 14-year-olds and smack the back of their heads.”
Elgin Physic, coach of the Lewiston-based MB Nation team in 2010, said he didn’t have many interactions with Woodbury.
“I heard him cuss at kids, but he didn’t cuss at my kids.” Physic said. “There’s no secret with how he is dealing with kids. This is his style, and either you like it or you don’t like it.”
While Woodbury is now dealing with many players leaving Nation Christian, the complaint filed against him in 2005 showed that parents wanted him to stop coaching long before now.
“If I can prevent this man who holds himself out as a coach and role model for young ladies from ever demeaning, inappropriately interacting and verbally abusing any other young lady, then my stepping forth with this information about Mr. Woodbury will be worth it,” Barker said.

Resumen: Advertisement Neither of the independents has raised any money and Bond, a Portland lawyer, has called on supporters instead to give to Maine charities, help Maine teachers with classroom projects or buy from small businesses in the state. Data gathered by the Wesleyan Media Project found that during the 10-day period that began Oct. 16, the party parity in the commercials was remarkably close, with those helping Democratic challenger Jared Golden outnumbering those for Poliquin by 170 — less than a 3 percent difference. During the entire campaign, three ads have been shown for the 2nd District race for every two shown in the gubernatorial contest in Maine, including the primaries both the Democrats and Republicans held to pick their nominees.

Texto completo: It probably seems you cannot escape the advertising for the 2nd Congressional District race in Maine.
In what may be the hottest political showdown in America, an average of 26 commercials tied to the contest aired every hour in Maine during a 10-day period that ended Oct. 25, according to the Wesleyan Media Project.
One of the most-costly political contests in the nation, Mainers are seeing more commercials this month than anywhere else in the land, all trying to convince voters either to re-elect Republican U.S. Rep. Bruce Poliquin on Nov. 6 or dump him in favor of Democrat Jared Golden.
Both of the contenders decry all of the money that is being spent, much of it by Super PACs they cannot control, but they are each spending at a rapid clip.
Candidates and outside organizations aired 6,312 ads between Oct. 16 and Oct. 25, more than 630 on average — and there is some indication the pace may have picked up since then.
Polls show that Poliquin and Golden are locked in a tight race whose outcome may well be decided in a ranked-choice vote election by the second- and third-place ballots cast by supporters of independents Tiffany Bond and Will Hoar.

Neither of the independents has raised any money and Bond, a Portland lawyer, has called on supporters instead to give to Maine charities, help Maine teachers with classroom projects or buy from small businesses in the state.
She said that if all of the money poured into her top rivals’ campaigns had gone to heating assistance, there would be many fewer poor Mainers shivering this winter.
Those forking over the money, though, are more interested in who controls Congress than they are in Bond’s notion.
During the entire midterm campaign season that began last year, only three districts in the country have seen more ads than Maine’s sprawling, mostly rural 2nd District.
The others — in Montana, Georgia and New York — are also in areas where advertising rates are comparatively cheap, as they are in Maine.
Advertisement
According to Kantar Media, $17.8 million has been spent on television advertising in Maine’s 2nd District through Oct. 25, the 10th-highest total in the nation. That bought 30,984 ads since the start of the race in 2017.
Data gathered by the Wesleyan Media Project found that during the 10-day period that began Oct. 16, the party parity in the commercials was remarkably close, with those helping Democratic challenger Jared Golden outnumbering those for Poliquin by 170 — less than a 3 percent difference.
During the entire campaign, however, Democrats have aired about 10 percent more ads than the GOP.
But GOP-connected super PACs and political organizations have spent more on ads for Poliquin than their Democratic counterparts.
There have been 6,164 ads from them aiming to help Poliquin — some boosting him and others attacking Golden — while the Democrats put on 5,648.
Advertisement
But Golden’s own campaign has aired more ads than Poliquin’s campaign by a margin of 10,560 to 6,738.
The counts of commercials look at buys made for television and national cable. There may well be local cable ads that do not show up in the totals and there are many ads on social media and websites that are not included.
Across the nation, a bit more than 1 million congressional race ads have aired for the midterm election. That means the Maine 2nd accounts for about 3 percent of the total volume.
That does not sound like much, but it is one of 435 seats — so it is accounting for about 15 times more advertising than the average congressional race.
During the entire campaign, three ads have been shown for the 2nd District race for every two shown in the gubernatorial contest in Maine, including the primaries both the Democrats and Republicans held to pick their nominees.

Texto completo: Name: Thomas Williams
Party: Democrat
Hometown: Mexico
Hobbies: Outside of work, I tend to be a person to take things as they come. I enjoy road trips, keeping up with friends and learning new things. I take pride in enhancing my knowledge about topics I may not know and really develop myself to be a well-rounded individual.
Can you talk a little bit about your background? What do you do for work?
Advertisement
My work experience is quite diverse. Upon graduation from high school, I worked as a youth training and project coordinator with the Maine Youth Action Network. My primary role was to travel to work with students and their advisers to teach advocacy and healthy partnership skills. I also had to track participation rates and have an outreach to communities that were not represented. After that, I worked in the technology field as a network technician and support specialist where customer service was a priority. Finally, and currently, I’m working in the social work field as a mental health case manager, serving Oxford, Franklin and Androscoggin counties.
How do you feel your work experience qualifies you for the position?
Throughout my various jobs, there has been a theme of customer service, record keeping, and project management. If elected, I will continue to use and expand on the skills I have acquired to ensure that the needs of the residents have been met. Record keeping and proper documentation have been two large pieces of my job in the past five years and these are the skills that will help with the position of register of deeds.
What are some things you’d like to accomplish, if elected?
The biggest change to the position compared to past years is the consolidation of the two register of deeds positions in Oxford County. Moving into the next year, I’d like to continue the work of the consolidation and ensure that the needs of the county are met. Furthermore, I’d like to continue with ensuring the integrity of our storage solutions and backups of all of the records which track the rich history of our county.

If there’s anything else that you’d like to share with readers and voters, you can write it here.
In 2017, I was elected to the Board of Selectmen in Mexico and also served on the Oxford County Budget Committee. I really enjoy working with the people in my community and addressing needs that have been brought forward while thinking of other ways to serve them.

Texto completo: AUBURN — John Michaud Sr., who with his son tied up a Park Avenue homeowner at gunpoint and stole her SUV and motorcycle a year ago, was sentenced Wednesday to serve 10 years in prison.
Michaud, 50, of 61 Shawmut St. in Lewiston agreed to a robbery plea on the third morning of his jury trial in Androscoggin County Superior Court.
Justice MaryGay Kennedy sentenced Michaud to 15 years in prison, with five years suspended, followed by two years of probation.
During sentencing, Kennedy told Michaud: “Make no mistake. Your conduct is reprehensible.”
Tina Croteau, who was bound in her home as Michaud aimed a handgun at her, spoke to him in the courtroom Wednesday.
“You, John Michaud, came into my house and terrorized me,” she said, her voice quavering.
Advertisement
Croteau said she no longer feels safe at her house.
“You kept saying to me I came home at the wrong time. Well, I came home at the right time, and I stopped you from hurting anybody else,” she said. “You should have run out the door you broke into because everybody knows you can’t fix stupid.”
Asked by the judge whether he wanted to say anything, Michaud replied, “Naw, I’m good.”
Kennedy told him, “What you did at the time was devastating, and it continues to this day.”
On Oct. 12, 2017, Croteau came home for lunch. She saw Michaud and his son, John Michaud II, 19, of Auburn at her house. They were wearing masks.

While she was still in her car, one of them pointed a gun in her face and told her, “You came home at the wrong time.”
She was forced into her house, where her wrists and ankles were bound with duct tape.
“She thought: ‘How is it going to feel when they shoot me? Will it hurt?’ She believed she was going to die,” Kennedy said.
Before Michaud and his son fled in Croteau’s SUV and her husband’s motorcycle, they added duct tape and phone cable to her restraints, Kennedy said.
Croteau was able to use the hinges on a lawn chair to free one leg. She made her way out to the street. After several cars drove past her, two men stopped and called 911.

He brother arrived after searching for her, having thought she had been in a car accident because her cellphone had disconnected earlier during a call with her mother. She was crying and shaking, Kennedy said.
Police later found Croteau’s SUV, which had been set on fire. The charred remains of her Bible were in the back seat.
Kennedy asked Croteau not to think of herself as a victim.
“You are one of the bravest people I have ever encountered,” she said. “You are a superhero to me.”
Although prosecutors had little evidence from the interior of Croteau’s home to tie Michaud to the crime, they were able to put his son at the scene because of a shoe print left inside the house and found the father’s DNA on the stolen motorcycle. Surveillance video captured the older Michaud riding the motorcycle in Poland.

Michaud entered an Alford plea, meaning he would not contest the charge of robbery with a dangerous weapon, a felony punishable by up to 30 years in prison. He also had faced felony charges of burglary and theft. Those charges and two misdemeanors were dismissed.
Michaud also pleaded guilty Wednesday to two felony charges of receiving stolen property in Franklin County, each punishable by up to five years in prison. He was sentenced to two years on each charge, to be served at the same time he serves 10 years for robbing Croteau.
In addition, Michaud admitted to a probation violation for which he was sentenced to 18 months, also to be served at the same time.
Shortly after the October 2017 robbery, Michaud Sr., who has a lengthy criminal record, and his son fled the state, the father ending up in Illinois, the son in Florida. Both were brought back to Maine months later to face charges.
John Michaud II, who had no previous criminal record, pleaded guilty to robbery. In an agreement with prosecutors, he could be sentenced to 15 years in prison, but would only have to serve between five and eight, followed by four years of probation.

He has not been sentenced.

Texto completo: Many claims are being made by candidates and commercials in the battle for Maine’s 2nd District congressional seat. Some are true. Some are, at best, a stretch.
Some are outright lies.
With millions of dollars pouring into Maine for television advertisements that often take aim at Democrat Jared Golden or Republican Bruce Poliquin — along with an assortment of nasty mailers — voters in the Nov. 6 race are hard-pressed to figure out what is true and what is not.
Here is a look at some of the claims and the facts behind them
GOLDEN WILL TAKE AWAY YOUR HEATING OIL?
An advertisement for Poliquin saying Golden would “stop Mainers from purchasing home heating oil, natural gas or even gasoline” is highly exaggerated .
Advertisement
On the energy topic, Golden has said he would support a ban on new fossil fuel infrastructure in the state (new pipelines, etc.) as part of an effort to rely on green energy for all of Maine’s energy needs by 2050.
A 32-year transition away from fossil fuels — which would be too slow to prevent catastrophic climate change, according to a recent United Nations report — does not mean Golden is against Mainers having heat for their homes or fuel for their cars, which is what the advertisement implies. Nor does it mean Mainers would no longer be able to buy fossil fuels.
POLIQUIN FIGHTS FOR MAINE JOBS?
In a recent Facebook post, Poliquin made a series of statements about his stance on jobs over the years, including the assertion that he “fought unfair Chinese subsidies before the International Trade Commission” and pushed the Veterans Administration to pay its bills more quickly. Both are true .
Poliquin helped Auburn Manufacturing Co. of Mechanic Falls win a case vital to its ongoing success. He also pressed the VA to cough up past-due bills, according to the chairman of the House Committee on Veterans Affairs, Phil Roe, R-Tenn.
Advertisement
It is also true that Poliquin has opposed many trade deals, including the Trans-Pacific Partnership that President Donald Trump quit soon after taking office. Also correct is Poliquin’s comment that unemployment is down since he took office after the 2014 election, both nationally and in Maine, and that wages have gone up.
GOLDEN TAKING AWAY SENIORS’ SOCIAL SECURITY?
A new television advertisement targeted at seniors accuses Golden of wanting “to turn your golden years into his” by supporting Medicare-for-all, and of using “your Social Security to fund other government programs.”
The National Republican Campaign Committee assertions are baseless .
The ad points to a May 23 Portland Press Herald column by Golden. However, the column merely explains Golden’s support for a home health care initiative on this year’s Maine ballot. The proposal would be implemented only in Maine and would not spend any Social Security money.
Advertisement
The NRCC claims Golden “will do anything to pay for his … agenda — even if it means ending Medicare as we know it,” said its communications director, Matt Gorman.
Again, false and misleading . The Medicare-for-all idea that Golden supports — which would be costly — would not end Medicare “as we know it.” In fact, it would extend the popular program to all Americans, not just seniors. Golden has said he would start by letting those 55 and older join the program if they needed affordable medical coverage.
POLIQUIN SUPPORTS THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT?
Poliquin routinely talks about his 2015 vote in opposition to repeal of the Affordable Care Act.
What he doesn’t mention often is his House vote in 2017 in favor of repeal of the same law, which sent the issue to the U.S. Senate, where Republican Susan Collins of Maine voted against repeal, retaining the program. For that reason, his comments on the campaign trail about his 2015 vote are less then genuine .
Advertisement
GOLDEN WILL TAKE AWAY GUN RIGHTS?
Based on Golden’s past actions and statements, for the vast majority of gun owners, that statement is false .
Poliquin has repeatedly pointed out the National Rifle Association gave Golden a D rating while awarding him an A. That statement is true . Poliquin also has the endorsement of the Sportsman’s Alliance of Maine.
Golden, a former combat Marine, said his low NRA rating came in part “because I took a stand to protect the victims of domestic abuse” by making it harder for their abusers to get guns.
Golden said in a recent debate he would also restrict access to guns to people with mental illness who are potentially dangerous, as well as to those on the federal government’s “No Fly” list compiled to target possible terrorists.
Advertisement
On the other hand, Golden has opposed banning so-called assault rifles and opposed efforts by some Democratic colleagues to pressure the Kittery Trading Post to stop selling them. He also did not go along with a move to raise the age of purchasing a firearm from 18 to 21, and opposed a 2016 referendum to expand background checks “because it went too far.”
In support of Poliquin’s A rating, Poliquin appears to have voted with the NRA line on every U.S. House bill since his 2014 election, including one in 2017 that repealed an Obama-era regulation that added some people with mental illnesses to the FBI’s background check database.

Texto completo: PORTLAND — Five more men charged in a Twin Cities-based medical marijuana-growing operation that was busted by federal agents in February have entered pleas in U.S District Court.
Police said the men cultivated marijuana at numerous warehouses in Androscoggin County and distributed marijuana to people who were not participants in Maine’s medical marijuana program, including out-of-state customers.
On Oct. 5, 14 suspects were charged in a sweeping indictment. As of this week, eight of the 14 had made initial appearances in court.
Brian Bilodeau, 33, of Auburn and his company, Brian Bilodeau LLC, made an initial appearance Monday, pleading not guilty to nine charges stemming from the busts.
Bilodeau was charged in an October indictment with conspiracy to distribute marijuana, manufacturing a controlled substance, possession with intent to distribute marijuana, possession of a firearm in furtherance of drug trafficking, money laundering conspiracy and three counts of illegal monetary transactions.
Bilodeau was released on a $140,000 secured bond and ordered to surrender his passport. His conditions of release specify he not travel outside of Maine and not possess narcotics or controlled substances, including legally prescribed medical marijuana.

According to previous reports, agents searched Bilodeau’s home Feb. 27, where they seized 183 pounds of marijuana, butane hash oil, a loaded .380-caliber pistol, a loaded 9mm pistol, an unloaded .45-caliber pistol and an unloaded .22-caliber rifle.
The marijuana, hash oil and one gun were found in a concrete room measuring 8-by-10 feet in the basement of Bilodeau’s house. The room was secured with a metal vault door, according to an affidavit filed by a federal drug agent. Two guns were found in the master bedroom, one on top of a nightstand and loaded. The rifle was found in another bedroom.
Agents also seized a 2016 Lamborghini Huracan, valued at $190,000, and a 2014 Nissan GT-R, valued at $60,000.
Daniel Poland, Brandon Knutson, Timothy Veilleux and Caleb Laberge all made initial appearances last Thursday in U.S. District Court in Portland, each pleading not guilty to many charges stemming from the bust.
Poland, 32, of Auburn pleaded not guilty to 10 counts, including conspiracy to distribute marijuana, manufacturing a controlled substance, possession with intent to distribute MDMA, possession with intent to distribute Alprazolam (a controlled substance used to treat anxiety), possession with intent to distribute marijuana, money laundering, destruction or removal of property to prevent search or seizure and two counts of illegal monetary transactions.

Federal agents Feb. 27 searched the house, warehouse and office of Poland, who was arrested March 12.
The search of Poland’s office turned up files for his company, TY Construction, which is incorporated in Maine, according to agents.
In the office, agents discovered pink ecstasy pills in a small credenza between two bookshelves, according to an agent’s affidavit.
Agents also found two bags concealed behind another desk in the office. One bag contained pink pills, the other white pills believed to be Alprazolam. No prescription bottle for the medication was found at the office, according to Gagnon.
Tax records reflected income earned by TY Construction.

Agents found a key in a baseball glove that opened an office safe where $140,000 in cash had been secured. Another $16,370 in cash was found elsewhere in the office.
Poland’s unsecured bond was set at $50,000.
Knutson, 33, of Lewiston pleaded not guilty to one charge of conspiracy to distribute marijuana. His appearance bond was set at $10,000. His conditions of release include no possession of a firearm or unlawful possession of narcotic drugs or controlled substances, including marijuana.
Timothy Veilleux, 52, of Auburn pleaded not guilty to four counts, including conspiracy to distribute marijuana, and three counts of maintaining a drug-involved premises. Veilleux allegedly distributed marijuana through a his property at 1830 St. Lisbon St. in Lewiston.
Veilleux’s unsecured bond was set at $50,000, and he was ordered to surrender his passport. Veilleux cannot possess a firearm under his bond restrictions.

Laberge, 23, of Lewiston pleaded not guilty to one count of conspiracy to distribute marijuana, and posted a $10,000 unsecured bond. Laberge’s conditions of release prevent him from possessing a firearm or narcotic drugs or controlled substances, including legally prescribed medical marijuana.
Richard “Stitch” Daniels, 52, of Lewiston and Steven Gallucci, 22, of Haverhill, Massachusetts, entered not guilty pleas to related charges last Thursday.
The same day, Charles Caliri, 70, of Woodstock, Vermont, pleaded not guilty to one count of possession with intent to distribute marijuana.

H.S. field hockey: Winthrop's Moriah Hajduk a two-way standout

Resumen: Senior Moriah Hajduk is listed as a midfielder, but depending how the game is going she might be on the front line trying to add to her point totals (she has 12 goals and 15 assists this season), or on the back line helping the defense. Most likely, when Winthrop meets Spruce Mountain in the Class C state championship at Deering High School’s Memorial Stadium (Saturday, 1 p.m.), Hajduk will need to do both as the Ramblers look to claim their first state championship since 1989. Merrill said that Hajduk is almost a coach on the field, someone who will be and an extra voice so it’s not just the coaching staff trying to relay messages.

Texto completo: One of the Winthrop’s best offensive players is also one of its best defenders.
Senior Moriah Hajduk is listed as a midfielder, but depending how the game is going she might be on the front line trying to add to her point totals (she has 12 goals and 15 assists this season), or on the back line helping the defense.
Most likely, when Winthrop meets Spruce Mountain in the Class C state championship at Deering High School’s Memorial Stadium (Saturday, 1 p.m.), Hajduk will need to do both as the Ramblers look to claim their first state championship since 1989.
If she has to choose, Hajduk’s preference is trying to stop goals.

“I actually like being more defensive, because I started off as a defensive player when I started playing field hockey because it was the only thing I felt I could do,” Hajduk said. “I really have stepped up with my offensive skills, and I like being able to play anywhere, knowing I can be there for my team when they need me. I have the confidence in myself I can help in any situation that I can.”
Hajduk’s biggest strength as a defender may be her small stature because it allows her to be low to the ground, and she’s able to use her skills better.
She credits the Maine Majestix — a club team based in Waterville — with helping improve her offensive skills and gaining the confidence to be an all-around threat on the field.
Winthrop coach Jessica Merrill likes having a rover on the field who provides flexibility in the lineup and isn’t limited one portion of the field.
“The plan was to put her wherever we needed her at the time,” Merrill said. “She’s so sound offensively and defensively, she’s solid there, so depending how the game goes we adjust it accordingly. If we need a goal, she’s up front, if we need more defense, she’s out back. It really depends on the game, we have senior backs that can carry the game as well. It’s nice to have that extra flexibility with here because she’s so versatile.”

The Ramblers have bought into that versatility,a nd Merrill said the players don’t care who’s scoring the goals or who’s defending, they just want to win.
Hajduk usually starts the game up front, as the Ramblers look to grab the lead and make the other team play catch-up. Once the lead is safe and they don’t need an insurance marker, she’ll be moved to the back line.
“We want to structure ourselves more on the defensive side to make sure they don’t get any more opportunities,” Hajduk said. “If it’s the other way around and we are down, or if it’s a tough game, I’ll stay on the offensive side.”
In the regular season, Winthrop won both matchups, 1-0 on Sept. 14 and 3-0 on Sept. 26.
Hajduk’s fellow defenders love when she moves to the back line.

“We feel like we know if Moriah is near the ball, she’s most likely going to get it,” senior midfielder Katie Perkins said. “If not, she’s going to slow the girl down, no matter what.”
Perkins said Hajduk brings intensity and is the engine that makes the Ramblers go, whether it’s during a game or in a practice.
Merrill said that Hajduk is almost a coach on the field, someone who will be and an extra voice so it’s not just the coaching staff trying to relay messages.
“She’s my floor general on the field, along with Katie Perkins,” Merrill said. “It’s nice to have them on different lines, whether she’s directing the front line and Katie is directing the back line. It’s good to have those extra voices that are out there that know what I am thinking before I even say it. Her and Kate are the first ones to step up, either before the game or at halftime, to say what I was going to say so I don’t have to.”

Texto completo: Name: Cherri Crockett
Party: Republican
Hometown: Bethel
Hobbies: I am an avid outdoorswoman and enjoy hiking, snowshoeing and exploring our great state via woods trails. I enjoy photography, reading, practicing reiki, riding my motorcycle and spending time with my family and friends. I am a dog mom to two senior Labs. I also enjoy networking events with my Business Networking International family through BNI Maine functions, where I’ve met some amazing friends and business associates.
Can you talk a little bit about your background? What do you do for work?

Understanding property rights and the history of the area have come in handy while helping my husband, a veteran logger, obtain land information for wood harvesting over the past two decades.
I am self-employed and have worked as secretary for my husband’s business for more than 20 years, and understand the importance of keeping accurate financial records. I have also worked as a customer service representative for a financial institution, caring for and categorizing account openings, closings, small loans and acting steward of safe-deposit boxes. I spent some time as a Chamber of Commerce admin, where I worked full-time promoting local business, seeking sources of growth for the area and keeping records for the nonprofit.
I’ve always had a place in my heart for history and for those who had the foresight to keep records. I am one of those people.
How do you feel your experience qualifies you for the position?
Anyone holding a public office must uphold a high standard of fiscal responsibility with taxpayer dollars. I will be that public servant.
Advertisement
Understanding the importance of accurate record keeping is vital to the Register of Deeds position. Possessing a craving, if you will, for the history of my home county and the desire to see that history preserved in a way for generations to come is of great value.
My organizational skills and commitment to working well with people are of utmost importance for a successful and productive internal work environment, as well as those who require the assistance of the deeds office.
What are some things you’d like to accomplish, if elected?
First and foremost, I would like to keep the legacy that our current registers have worked so diligently to set in place at the South Paris and Fryeburg offices. I will consider it a great honor to build off their successful efforts and make improvements where needed.
Secondly, it’s been decided by the Legislature that the East and West offices will merge after all statutes have been met in order to ensure a seamless transition to one office. During this transition, I will be in contact with attorneys, realtors and other who frequent the deeds office as part of their everyday work to do what’s best for all involved.
Advertisement
If there’s anything else you’d like to share with readers and voters, you can write it here.
I’m very much a goal-oriented individual who strives to do the best job I can with whatever task I’m handed. As your next register of deeds, I can promise you my full commitment to ensuring accurate record keeping, precise attention to my fiscal responsibility to the people of Oxford County, as well as a voice to protect the highest standards and integrity of all that the deeds office has been built to represent.

On Election Day, will two more states go to pot?

Resumen: Recreational marijuana studies are still inconclusive. Until the haze clears, voters shouldn't hesitate to nip full legalization in the bud: Our view

Texto completo: As voters in Michigan and North Dakota head to the polls Tuesday to weigh whether marijuana should be legal for recreational use, they don’t have much definitive data to help make this difficult choice.
Although marijuana has been sold legally in Colorado and Washington state since 2014, conclusions about its effect on public health and safety are either limited or mixed.
While opponents predicted that use by teenagers would skyrocket, Colorado high school students' use of marijuana has stayed about the same since 2013, according to state studies. Last year, 19. 4 percent reported use in the past 30 days, close to the 19. 8 percent who used it nationally.
For those a little older, the story is quite different: Use by adults ages 18 to 25 has increased significantly. In 2015-16, about 32 percent of Coloradans in that age group reported marijuana use — up more than 50 percent since the same federal survey was taken a decade earlier.
That increase, and the fact that 11 percent of Colorado’s ninth-graders use marijuana, are worth weighing before Tuesday’s votes, especially in light of well-documented findings of the drug's detrimental effect on young brains.
OPPOSING VIEW: Pot never should have been illegal
Marijuana exposure before birth, soon after birth and during adolescence can cause long-term changes in the brain, including problems with learning and memory tasks later in life, according to animal research and a growing body of human studies.
The brain is still developing until age 25, and much more needs to be known about pot's effects on young people's brains. A major federal study will track a large sample of young Americans from late childhood to early adulthood over the next decade. But until that’s finished, voters have little to grab hold of on this important issue.
There's also this: Despite supporters' insistence that marijuana doesn’t pose much risk, the drug is addictive for some people. About 9 percent of those who use marijuana will become dependent, rising to 17 percent among those who start in their teens. In 2015, 4 million people in the USA suffered from marijuana use disorder — a significant problem that gets little attention in the marijuana debate, particularly from the moneyed interests promoting legalization.
While legalizing sales remains a tough choice, some changes in the nation’s policies are clearly needed: Harsh criminal penalties for personal use should be abandoned. And medicinal use — already legal in 31 states and up for a vote in Missouri and Utah on Tuesday — makes sense, as long as laws are not so loose that anyone can get a prescription.
Eight states have voted for legalization at the ballot box, and Vermont has done so through its legislature. In six — Alaska, California, Colorado, Nevada, Oregon and Washington — the drug is already on sale. Massachusetts and Maine are expected to join them next year. Vermont allows adults to grow and use small amounts, but does not allow sales.
States are the right laboratories to test whether regulated sales are a viable choice, and Colorado lawmakers showed prescience by requiring that numerous aspects of its experiment be studied and reported each year.
Even so, the findings there and elsewhere leave many open questions. Until the haze clears, voters shouldn't hesitate to nip full legalization in the bud.

Texto completo: NEW YORK — President Donald Trump will turn over portions of his calendars and journals as he battles a defamation lawsuit filed against him by Summer Zervos, a one-time contestant on his former TV show The Apprentice.
The Trump Organization, his New York City-based business, will produce Trump's calendars and or journal entries from November 2007 through February 2008, according to a legal stipulation signed by attorneys for both sides and filed in New York County Supreme Court on Tuesday.
The four-month period includes entries that outlined Trump's days during December 2007, the time when Zervos alleges he groped and forcibly kissed her in Los Angeles' Beverley Hills Hotel.
Zervos has also charged that Trump “ambushed” her more than once during 2007 — six years before he was elected president — by kissing her on the mouth, touching her breast and pressing his genitals against her.
Trump has denied the allegations. Raising arguments of presidential immunity in civil lawsuits, his attorneys have also tried to dismiss the lawsuit, delay it or limit legal discovery.
Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Jennifer Schecter has allowed the case to proceed while Trump's lawyers pursue the dismissal battle in a New York appeals court.
The legal stipulation enables the Trump Organization to designate some of the calendar or journal entries as confidential if they contain proprietary information.
Schecter has scheduled a Nov. 7 telephone conference for lawyers in the case to discuss the procedure for turning over electronically-stored information potentially relevant to the lawsuit.
The judge also has set a Jan. 31 deadline for legal depositions from both sides — a ruling that raises the prospect of Trump testifying under oath in the coming months.
Zervos is one of approximately a dozen women who have publicly raised allegations of past sexual misconduct against Trump, even as he campaigned for the White House in 2016.
She also has alleged that Trump defamed her during presidential campaign rallies and via Twitter posts. During an Oct. 15, 2016, campaign stop in Maine, Trump alluded to Zervos by referring to "false allegations and outright lies, in an effort to elect Hillary Clinton President," the lawsuit charges.
Previously, Shecter ruled that Trump does not have to provide documents or answer questions related to sexual misconduct allegations by other women.

Texto completo: As voters in Michigan and North Dakota head to the polls Tuesday to weigh whether marijuana should be legal for recreational use, they don’t have much definitive data to help make this difficult choice.
Although marijuana has been sold legally in Colorado and Washington state since 2014, conclusions about its effect on public health and safety are either limited or mixed.
While opponents predicted that use by teenagers would skyrocket, Colorado high school students' use of marijuana has stayed about the same since 2013, according to state studies. Last year, 19. 4 percent reported use in the past 30 days, close to the 19. 8 percent who used it nationally.
For those a little older, the story is quite different: Use by adults ages 18 to 25 has increased significantly. In 2015-16, about 32 percent of Coloradans in that age group reported marijuana use — up more than 50 percent since the same federal survey was taken a decade earlier.
That increase, and the fact that 11 percent of Colorado’s ninth-graders use marijuana, are worth weighing before Tuesday’s votes, especially in light of well-documented findings of the drug's detrimental effect on young brains.
OPPOSING VIEW: Pot never should have been illegal
Marijuana exposure before birth, soon after birth and during adolescence can cause long-term changes in the brain, including problems with learning and memory tasks later in life, according to animal research and a growing body of human studies.
The brain is still developing until age 25, and much more needs to be known about pot's effects on young people's brains. A major federal study will track a large sample of young Americans from late childhood to early adulthood over the next decade. But until that’s finished, voters have little to grab hold of on this important issue.
There's also this: Despite supporters' insistence that marijuana doesn’t pose much risk, the drug is addictive for some people. About 9 percent of those who use marijuana will become dependent, rising to 17 percent among those who start in their teens. In 2015, 4 million people in the USA suffered from marijuana use disorder — a significant problem that gets little attention in the marijuana debate, particularly from the moneyed interests promoting legalization.
While legalizing sales remains a tough choice, some changes in the nation’s policies are clearly needed: Harsh criminal penalties for personal use should be abandoned. And medicinal use — already legal in 31 states and up for a vote in Missouri and Utah on Tuesday — makes sense, as long as laws are not so loose that anyone can get a prescription.

These crabs may not be friends, but they can be food

Texto completo: Fishermen, restaurateurs, and marine biologists from Maine to Cape Cod are working to turn lemons into lemonade — or, more precisely, pests into food.
Since arriving in New England from Europe 200 years ago, green crabs have destroyed salt marshes by burrowing and eroding their root systems and become voracious predators of soft-shell clams.
Now, a team of researchers wants to turn the invasive species into a marketable asset of the seafood industry.
“If they're here to stay — which they seem to be — are there any ways to benefit from them?" asks Marissa McMahan, senior fisheries scientist at Manomet, an environmental research nonprofit headquartered in Plymouth.
Manomet was recently awarded a $267,440 Saltonstall-Kennedy Grant from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to work on establishing a green crab fishery industry in New England.
McMahan and her team of researchers and fishermen have spent two years researching the possibility of a green crab industry at a Manomet lab in Brunswick, Maine.
The grant pays for green crab population monitoring and exploration of best practices for production, marketing, and outreach to fishermen, chefs, and seafood dealers.
Adding green crabs to the seafood market could give fishermen in the Northeast a new, abundant source of income — and give marine life an escape from the aggressive predators.
“We're trying to turn [green crabs] into a commercial product," said Roger Warner, a fisherman and researcher who wrote a 2015 piece about the challenge for The Boston Globe Magazine. “Only if the seafood industry has incentives, will there be a large incentive to reduce [green crab] populations."
Warner, the project founder and coordinator of the Ipswich-based Green Crab Research and Development Project, works side by side with Manomet in the lemons-to-lemonade project.
Currently, most green crabs are sold as low-cost bait for use in fisheries south of Cape Cod, Warner said, but they can be used in a variety of culinary creations.
Turning green crabs into a food source makes them more valuable, he said. The more profit fishermen can earn, the more likely they are to fish for the creatures. The more green crabs that are plucked from the ocean, the less an effect they have on marine habitats.
“The green crab invasion is a symptom of changing oceans," Warner said. He added that focusing on one widely found species is a narrow but achievable way to help fishermen and the coastal environment. “We think we can make a difference, and we are coming up with some practical solutions and approaches to do so."
The soft-shell green crab industry has strong roots in Venice, Italy, where they are considered a delicacy, McMahan said. Manomet worked with Venetian fishermen, who shared their technology and knowledge about molting signs, harvesting, and selling soft-shell green crabs.
The trick to harvesting green crabs, McMahan said, is knowing when they're about to shed their shell. At that point, you pluck them from the water, then harvest them while they're soft-shelled.
They sell for $25 to $50 per pound in Italy, so McMahan and her colleagues saw this as an opportunity for local fishermen in Cape Cod, Maine, and New Hampshire to rake in “lucrative" profits.
This past summer, Chris Jamison, a commercial fisherman working with McMahan, made the first sale of soft-shell green grabs to restaurants for $3 each. Restaurants “couldn't get enough," McMahan said, and the fisherman sold 60 to 100 crabs a week.
Heather Atwood, a food writer on Cape Ann, has tried a number of green crab recipes after Warner introduced her to them.
“The mission was to imagine something that would really make it worthwhile to harvest," Atwood said.
For her first recipe, she sauteed 20 to 30 green crabs in a mirepoix stock with celery, carrots, onions, and bay leaves, added wine and water, and let the mixture simmer.
“It was the best fish stock I ever had," Atwood said. She described the taste as a cross between fish and beef stock, with a savory “umami" taste that enhances all flavors it touches. With that stock, she made risotto.
“I saw the possibilities, but the market issue is tough," she said. While commercially produced green crab stock would require taking a lot of green crabs out of the ocean, fishermen still wouldn't be getting a meaningful price, she said.
Green crab stocks just wouldn't pull in enough money to make the effort worth it for fishermen — on to the next dish.
Green crab roe is called mazanetta or masanete in Italy, and is available in females just before they spawn. It's like a cross between fish caviar and the tomalley inside a lobster, Atwood said, but is full of flavor.
“We think that's really the best way to go in terms of a commercial product," Atwood said.
Finding incentives to rid the ocean of so many green crabs is a win-win for all — except the crabs.
McMahan is worried that climate change could dramatically affect the lobster industry, leaving fishermen with even fewer options. She grew up trapping lobsters with her family in Maine and now researches the effect of climate change on marine life.
“I'm really concerned [about climate change], and work towards diversifying fishery opportunities," McMahan said. “So that if something were to happen to American lobster, fishermen would have something to fall back on."

Texto completo: SALT LAKE CITY — A week before its official regular-season opener and five days after its “secret scrimmage” game in California, the Utah basketball team will play its only exhibition game of the season Thursday night at the Huntsman Center against the College of Idaho.
“We’re ready to go,” said Ute coach Larry Krystkowiak. “I’m excited about it — it’s been a long five to six weeks of beating each other up, so it’s an opportunity to play somebody else and we’re thrilled to do it. I know we’ve got a really deep bench and we can keep them fresh.”
Krystowiak couldn’t say much about the scrimmage over the weekend, but his team played three 20-minute “halves” against Saint Mary’s of the WCC and the outcome was pretty even. He said the Utes lost the first period by 15, won the second period by 15 and the third period was “a slugfest.”
At first, Krystowiak said he didn’t know who would start Thursday night when he was asked, then said his three seniors would start — Sedrick Barefield, Parker Van Dyke and Novak Topalovic, a 7-foot graduate transfer from Idaho State.
Other players expected to be the Utes’ main players are sophomore forward Donnie Tillman, redshirt freshman guard Vante Hendrix, freshman forward Timmy Allen, JC transfer guard Charles Jones, freshman forward Both Gach and junior center Brandon Morley.
Junior center Jayce Johnson has missed the past month with a broken bone in his foot, but Krytkowiak said Johnson saw a doctor on Monday and it was “real favorable” and he should be practicing soon.
College of Idaho is an NAIA school that plays in the Cascade Conference with nine other schools in the Northwest and finished 30-7 last year.
The Yotes have played twice and are led by senior guard Keun Palu-Thompson (16.0 ppg), senior guard Gibson Berryhill (13.5 ppg), senior forward Matt Meyers (13.0 ppg) and sophomore forward Connor Desaulniers (11.0 ppg, 11.0 rpg).
The Utes will open the regular season Nov. 8 at home against Maine and then play at Minnesota on Nov. 12.

L.L. Bean to expand in Canada L.L. Bean, based in Freeport, Maine, is looking to sell more parkas, sweaters, flannel, and mittens in Canada as part of its strategy for a return to sales growth. The 106-year-old retailer's iconic boot and other products will be sold in 24 stores in Canada this holiday season, and in L.L. Bean-branded stores opening over the next decade. The company also has launched a dedicated Canadian website that smooths out duties and currency fluctuations. The deal, inked last week, makes sense because L.L. Bean has a strong customer base in Canada and its cold-weather gear and outdoor focus are a good fit, CEO Steve Smith said. — ASSOCIATED PRESS

McInnes criticized the ban in an e-mail Wednesday, saying it was a way to drum up "hysteria" prior to the midterm elections next week. "The left knows they are going to lose this election so they are ramping up the hysteria with fake news and censorship in a last ditch effort to win," he said. The Southern Poverty Law Center calls the all-male Proud Boys a hate group, but the Proud Boys reject the label and describe themselves as "Western chauvinists who refuse to apologize for creating the modern world." — ASSOCIATED PRESS
WAGES
Millennials, more than Boomers, will tell you what they make Millennials are almost twice as likely as Baby Boomers to share their salary with their co-workers, according to a new survey from personal finance site Bankrate. They're also more comfortable divulging their pay to other people in their lives, too, with almost two-thirds of those surveyed sharing how much they make with their family. Employers have long discouraged talking about pay among co-workers. It's easier to underpay certain people — certain groups of people — if they don't know they're being underpaid. Calls for more fairness in pay, however, have prompted calls for more transparency. Workers want to know more about what goes into their compensation, and they want to know they're getting a fair deal. — BLOOMBERG NEWS
JOBS
Companies added 227,000 jobs in October US companies added 227,000 jobs in October, according to a private survey, a healthy gain that suggests businesses can still find workers even with the unemployment rate reaching 49-year lows. Payroll processor ADP said that employers added jobs in manufacturing, retail, and professional services such as engineering. October's hiring was the strongest in eight months. The report Wednesday comes two days before the publication of the government's jobs report. Economists believe that the Labor Department numbers will show employers added 190,000 jobs. ADP's report doesn't include government employment and frequently diverges from the official figures, however. — ASSOCIATED PRESS

Sales at Taco Bell and KFC boost parent company Better-than-expected results at Taco Bell and KFC helped Yum Brands top Wall Street's forecasts in the third quarter. But Pizza Hut remained a weak spot on the company's balance sheet, with same-store sales growth down in the United States, China, and Europe. Yum Brands Inc. CEO Greg Creed said product innovation, value pricing, and good advertising are behind Taco Bell's success. Over the summer, Taco Bell launched a $2 Duo burrito and drink combo and reintroduced its popular nacho fries. KFC saw significant growth overseas. Same-store sales jumped 25 percent in India and 22 percent in Russia and Eastern Europe in the July-September period, the company said. Pizza Hut continues to struggle with older dine-in restaurants in the United States, where customers increasingly want carryout and delivery. Dine-in makes up just 10 percent of Pizza Hut's US sales. — ASSOCIATED PRESS

Sprint and T-Mobile executives optimistic about merger Sprint Corp. and T-Mobile US Inc. soared after executives of both companies expressed optimism that their $26.5 billion merger is headed for approval. “We have been participating with regulators through the review process and we feel pretty good about our chances," T-Mobile chief executive John Legere said Tuesday in an interview after the company reported third-quarter earnings. Wednesday was the final day for opposing arguments to be filed with the Federal Communications Commission. The companies have argued that they need each other to keep up the pressure on the two biggest carriers — Verizon Communications Inc. and AT&T Inc.— and build a next-generation wireless network. Regulators must decide whether consolidation of the two aggressive competitors can be good for consumers. — BLOOMBERG NEWS
COSMETICS
Estee Lauder profits off skin-care rather than makeup Estee Lauder Cos.'s skin-care regimen is showing more signs of staying power. Revenue from skin-care products surpassed that of makeup for a third consecutive quarter at the company, which owns beauty brands such as Clinique and Bobbi Brown in addition to its flagship label. Skin care now accounts for more than 40 percent of revenue and more than half of profit. Skin care has dominated beauty conversations lately, as shoppers turn to products like niacinamide serums, hydration masks, and jelly cleansers to soothe their tired skin. Estee Lauder is taking advantage of the trend, debuting a new treatment lotion mask and supercharged eye repair gel last quarter. — BLOOMBERG NEWS

eBay bullish on holiday sales EBay Inc. gave an upbeat profit forecast for the rest of the year, signaling a busy holiday quarter and calming investor fears about slowing sales. The shares gained about 3 percent Wednesday. Earnings, excluding some items, will be $2.29 a share to $2.31 a share for the year, the San Jose, Calif.-based company said Tuesday in a statement. The profit outlook topped analysts' average estimate of $2.28. Third-quarter adjusted earnings were 56 cents a share. Analysts' projected 55 cents a share. Chief executive Devin Wenig is trying to differentiate the online marketplace as a destination for deals and discovery without membership fees.

Scotland Yard to sell its own souvenirs London's police force is aiming to earn some cash with a line of toys, clothes, and souvenirs bearing the Scotland Yard logo. The force has granted permission for its logo, images of officers on patrol, and the rotating "Scotland Yard" sign outside police headquarters to be used on merchandise. New York's Police Department has a successful range of NYPD-branded goods, but London's 189-year-old force has previously sold just a few items including cuff links, mugs, and pens. — ASSOCIATED PRESS

Texto completo: They know a thing or two about finish lines over at New Balance. Crossing this particular one is a good reason to throw a victory party.
The Boston shoe company just shipped its first order of 100 percent American-made running shoes to the Defense Logistics Agency, some 6,000 pairs. Senators Susan Collins and Angus King and Representative Bruce Poliquin toured New Balance's factory in Norridgewock, Maine, on Tuesday to celebrate with the 300-plus employees there.
This race was a marathon, not a sprint. The company, led by owner Jim Davis, has been at this for more than seven years.
First, New Balance pushed the Department of Defense to honor the 1940s-era law known as the Berry Amendment, which requires military recruits to be outfitted with apparel made in the United States. Defense officials had long argued there wasn't enough competition to apply Berry to running shoes; the supply chains for domestic footwear manufacturing, the argument went, have long been broken apart.
New Balance set out to prove them wrong. The Pentagon relented in 2014 and agreed to buy US-made shoes. But two years passed, and no orders were placed.
New Balance CEO Rob DeMartini, who is leaving his job Dec. 31, publicly tangled with the Obama administration in 2016 over the delays. So New Balance's champions in Congress, including Poliquin and Representative Niki Tsongas of Lowell, inserted language in a military spending bill that essentially forced the DoD to comply.
The federal bureaucracy's wheels usually turn slowly, regardless of who is in the White House. Finally, the Maine delegation announced in March that New Balance had won a $17 million contract. Work began on the midsoles in Brighton in August, with the bulk of the manufacturing taking place in Norridgewock. And New Balance began shipping supplies of the finished shoe — known as the 950v2 — out of its Lawrence distribution center in mid-October. The company expects to ship 92,000 pairs by the end of next year.
Another Massachusetts company, Waltham-based Saucony, was supposed to be in the running. But its parent, Wolverine Worldwide, sold its military contract business, including the Michigan factory where it made combat boots, to Original Footwear last year. That prompted Saucony to drop out of the race.
But other competitors did land athletic-shoe contracts alongside New Balance: San Antonio Shoemakers and Propper International.
New Balance, a spokeswoman said, will ship roughly 25 percent of all Berry-compliant athletic shoes to military recruits over an 18-month period.
For a company with $4 billion in global revenue, the military contract seems like barely more than a rounding error. But every little bit counts for the 1,300 workers at New Balance's five shoe factories in New England, and their 15-plus domestic suppliers. While New Balance makes the bulk of its shoes overseas, its executives continue to preach the importance of domestic manufacturing. These are important blue-collar jobs, in places that have seen too many disappear over the years.
Davis and his team probably never expected this race for military business to take so long. But their endurance has finally paid off.

St. George's Greek Ball was once the glittering highlight of Bangor's social calendar

Texto completo: From the 1950s into the early 1990s, when many Bangorians flipped their calendars from September to October, a date sometime that month would have already been circled: the date of the Greek Ball, the unofficial start to Bangor's social year.
Organized for more than 40 years by the parish council of St. George Greek Orthodox Church in Bangor, the Greek Ball attracted close to 1,000 people each year at its peak in the 1960s and 1970s. It was renowned for its elaborate decorations, top-notch music and food, eye-popping fashion, enthusiastic dancing and its steady flow of ouzo, the beloved Greek liqueur.
"Everybody dressed to the nines. It was the social event of the season," said Susan Jonason, a parishioner at St. George's, though she arrived in Bangor in 1994, just after the last kalamatianos was danced at the last Greek Ball held in 1993. "I would just have loved to see that."
[image id="2711404" size="full" pos="center" /]
Longtime St. George member Lambros Karris went nearly every year, starting when he arrived in Bangor in 1969 until the the last dance was held 24 years later.
"It was something that everybody in the church worked really hard on, and it was a really significant cultural event for the area," said Karris, a retired professor at Husson University. "It was a chance to wear tuxedos and get dressed up. It was something different."
"I remember the fun of it -- the anticipation, shopping for a dress, getting all gussied up," said Paula Page, who with her husband was a church member for years until they moved to Florida a decade ago. "It was just a bit party for everybody, Greek or not."
There were other social events in Bangor, such as the events held by the Eastern Maine Medical Center Auxiliary, the Bangor Symphony Orchestra and the YMCA -- but none had either the cachet, nor were quite as over-the-top, as the Greek Ball. Decorations were a major part of the event each year; Greek columns, costumes, statues and other icons of Greek antiquity were crafted by organizers, right alongside the homemade baklava.
"One year we had a huge Trojan horse that we made, right at the entrance to the event. My son George dressed as a Greek soldier from antiquity. Those are the kinds of things you remember," Karris said.
"I remember building that thing on somebody's lawn in Hampden because that was the only place we could fit that monstrosity," Page said. "It was really such a hoot."
Eleven years ago, Jonason and other parishioners decided to bring back some of the elements of the Greek Ball -- the food and the dancing, specifically -- with a new event, also to be held in the fall. Dancing With The Greeks, as it is now called, this year is set for 7 p.m. Saturday at the Bangor Masonic Center at 294 Union St.
"We just want to cook up some really great food, and carry on these traditions, and get into the spirit of the culture through dancing," Jonason said. "We're a fun bunch."
The Dancing With The Greeks event is also now the only place Bangor residents can get their hands on the fabulous gyros, souvlaki, spanakopita and other classic Greek dishes that were traditionally a part of St. George's booth at the American Folk Festival food court. This year was the first year St. George's did not participate, which Jonason says was simply due to the amount of time and effort it takes to make all that food for three days.
"It's a huge responsibility that takes up an enormous amount of the summer, and at some point, you just need a break," she said. "But that's why we're bringing it back to the Greek dance, so people can still get a taste of our cooking."
[image id="2711406" size="full" pos="center" /]
Hospitality is a fundamental aspect of Greek and Greek-American culture, Karris said, and that's why everything St. George's does -- the ball, the folk festival booth and, now, the Dancing With The Greeks event -- reflects that spirit.
"Greeks are very hospitable people. In the Greek language, the word 'hospitality' translates to 'friendship to the stranger,' and I think that's why people always want to come to what we do," he said.
For more information on the Dancing With The Greeks event, visit its Facebook page. Tickets are available at the door. A free Greek dancing lesson is set for 7 p.m. Thursday, Nov. 1, at St. George's, located at 90 Sanford St.

Maine Democrats parlay public financing to big campaign cash advantage

Texto completo: Good morning from Augusta. Democrats are outspending Republicans by a historic margin in legislative races in 2018 as they seek to win control of both chambers for the first time in six years -- though plenty of battlegrounds remain, particularly in the Maine Senate.
Legislative races are often overshadowed and they have been particularly this year because of the intense national interest in Maine's 2nd Congressional District and the open-seat governor's race. But the makeup of the Legislature will set the tenor for the next governor's administration.
In the Senate, Republicans hold the slimmest possible 18-17 majority. Democrats have only a plurality in the House, but they're in control of the lower chamber 73-70 over Republicans with seven other members who generally lean Democrats' way as a group.
Republicans are used to being outspent in legislative races, but this year is different. In the last five legislative cycles from 2008 to 2016, Democrats have generally used an edge in outside money to outspend Republicans in legislative races. In 2018, the candidates are also spending more and management of the taxpayer-funded Clean Election program is a major reason why.
In both chambers, Democrats have spent just over 69 percent of the campaign money and outside money that has come into legislative races this year. From 2008 to 2016, their overall edge by that measure was 55 percent -- a gap that often has proven manageable for them.
The added outside money is helping Democrats in competitive races. In the Senate, the biggest race by outside money is the one between Assistant House Minority Leader Ellie Espling, R-New Gloucester, and physician Ned Claxton of Auburn, which drew $340,000 according to data available Tuesday night -- 75 percent of that from Democratic groups.
In the House, seven races have drawn at least $20,000 in outside money. Four have Republican incumbents, three have Democratic incumbents and one seat is open. The priciest race is in Skowhegan between Rep. Betty Austin, a Democrat, and Republican Anne Amadon. Democrats are outspending Republicans in each one.
Those highest-spending Senate campaigns are being driven by taxpayer money. Some of those candidates will likely come up short. The 12 highest spenders are using the Clean Election system -- which was disabled by Gov. Paul LePage for part of the campaign -- and 10 of them are Democrats to just one Republican and one independent.
Most of them are candidates in toss-up races, including both House Majority Leader Erin Herbig, D-Belfast, and her opponent, former state Rep. Jayne Crosby Giles, R-Belfast. Claxton is third at just over $65,000 in campaign spending while Espling has spent just over $18,000.
But they also include longer shots, including Democrat Jan Collins of Wilton, running against Rep. Russell Black, R-Wilton, in a long-red district and independent Crystal Canney of Portland, who is facing Sen. Ben Chipman, D-Portland, in the state's bluest district. Sen. Jim Dill, D-Old Town, has spent $50,000 in a race with Maia Dendinger, a Maine Socialist Party candidate from Orono running as an independent.
There are still pick-up opportunities for Republicans, though mapping their road to victory in the House is difficult. All of this money, a likely Democratic-leaning national environment and a higher number of termed-out Republicans probably gives Democrats the edge in both chambers.
However, we also said that in 2016. Senate Republicans clung to a majority and House Republicans gained seats. In the Senate, Republicans have a few crucial pick-up opportunities that could decide whether or not they hang on. They include the race between Sen. Michael Carpenter, D-Houlton, and Republican Kathy Reynolds of Houlton.
It seems to be a harder road for Republicans in the more volatile House, where Democrats are sinking the most money into southern Maine districts that were generally unkind to President Donald Trump while defending some incumbents in rural seats, including Austin and Rep. Seth Berry, D-Bowdoinham, who is running against Republican Guy Lebida of Bowdoin.
A day for debates
Debates dominated Maine's political landscape on Tuesday, but the dialogue was more about brand reinforcement than making news. Gubernatorial candidates Shawn Moody, a Republican, and independent Terry Hayes spent two hours Tuesday morning talking about their campaigns on WGAN radio. Democrat Janet Mills did not participate.
Other than disagreeing on how Maine should select its attorney general -- Moody thinks the governor should appoint one while Hayes likes the current method of having the Legislature elect constitutional officers -- each candidate primarily spent the morning reinforcing campaign narratives by reiterating past statements.
Maine Public hosted debates for U.S. House candidates. The leading candidates in the 2nd Congressional District ignored it, so we will too. The three candidates vying in Maine's 1st District -- where incumbent Democrat Chellie Pingree is a distinct favorite -- engaged in some gentle back-and-forth on climate change, immigration and money in politics. Republican Mark Holbrook and independent Marty Grohman -- who is hoping that this year's first-in-the-nation use of ranked-choice voting will open a path for an upset victory -- toned down the bickering that had marked previous debates. Holbrook continued to tout his conservative bona fides -- despite running in a district where the electorate tilts left -- while Grohman continued to present himself as an antidote to partisan gridlock.
In a late flurry before Election Day, the three candidates in this year's U.S. Senate contest participated in two debates on Tuesday. Maine Public hosted an afternoon debate, followed a few hours later by the third televised Senate debate this week, sponsored by WGME and co-moderated by the BDN's Mike Shepherd. U.S. Sen. Angus King, I-Maine, is favored to retain his seat for a second six-year term. He is being challenged by Republican state Sen. Eric Brakey of Auburn and Democrat Zak Ringelstein of Yarmouth.
The three tussled over immigration, gun control, Chinese tariffs, trade policy and health care, as well as a controversial tweet of Brakey's that was criticized in Portland Press Herald editorial Monday for fanning the conspiracy-theory flame on immigration. Brakey was also asked about his position on Trump's desire to sign an executive order to essentially alter the Constitution and end automatic citizenship for children born in the U.S. to undocumented immigrants.
When pressed, Brakey explained why he believes an executive order from Trump to rewrite the 14th Amendment would be lawful or appropriate.
"It's not just enough to be born here," Brakey said, claiming that children born in the U.S. to illegal immigrants "aren't really here under our jurisdiction." Suggesting otherwise "devalues" our citizenship process, he said.
King sharply disagreed, saying, "Anybody born here and living here is subject to the jurisdiction of the state. As a conservative, how can you possibly support a president who's saying he can amend the Constitution?"
Ringelstein said the president "wants to take us off the cliff of authoritarianism."
Otherwise, Tuesday night's debate was a reprise of earlier forums in which Brakey ripped King from the right while Ringelstein jabbed from the left. All three candidates will convene Thursday on WMTW-TV for their last debate.
Mailer questioned
Targeted mailings to Maine voters from a New Hampshire-based "right to work" advocacy group piqued the interest of ethics watchdogs. The Maine Ethics Commission is scheduled to meet at 9 a.m. today for a hearing on whether New England Citizens Right to Work Inc. violated Maine law by failing to file an independent expenditure report for the Oct. 22 mailings.
In a response to the commission, representatives of the anti-labor union organization argue that the mailing campaign should be exempt from independent expenditure reporting mandates because it was a candidate survey designed "to inform and educate Right to Work supporters about their candidates' positions on the forced unionism issue and encourage them to lobby all of their candidates in support of Right to Work."
Commission staff also questioned whether the group would be required to register as a political action committee in Maine. These issues are relatively minor compared to some past late campaign season transgressions, but the questions raised highlight the ongoing challenge that campaign overseers face as tactics evolve and as gray areas in existing law come to light.
Reading list
A legal battle over whether public money can be used to pay tuition at religious schools in Maine is heating up. The American Civil Liberties Union, its Maine chapter and Americans United for Separation of Church and State on Tuesday filed a motion to intervene in a federal lawsuit that claims the denial of public funds to religious schools in Maine is unconstitutional. Three Maine families in Glenburn, Orrington and Palermo in August sued Maine Education Commissioner Robert Hasson in U.S. District Court in Bangor on behalf of their children. Those towns don't have their own high schools, and the families argued in their complaint that Maine's tuition law "violates the principle that the government must not discriminate against, or impose legal difficulties on, religious individuals or institutions simply because they are religious." Zach Heiden, legal director of the ACLU of Maine, said in a release that prior state and federal court rulings have established precedent that "taxpayers cannot be required to pay to teach children how to pray."
A Maine woman convicted of stealing her sister's identity faces deportation. Mount Desert Island resident Emilita Arindela assumed her sister's identity, faked her own death in her native Philippines and married four times, with the marriages overlapping. The 43-year-old's story just gets more interesting from there. A recent federal conviction could trigger deportation proceedings. Click here to read the details.
Penobscot County has its first contested election for district attorney this century. The rare contest has triggered more campaign spending. Republican Marianne Lynch and Democrat Joseph Belisle have spent far more than the man they are hoping to replace spent during the past two decades in his re-election campaigns. Lynch has raised $8,250, about three-and-a-half times the $2,330 Belisle has raised, according to the latest campaign finance reports filed Friday with the Maine Ethics Commission. She was her own largest contributor, giving the campaign $6,200. Belisle, a Bangor attorney with a solo practice, made a $655 contribution to his campaign, making him the largest donor. As of Friday, Lynch had about $483 on hand and Belisle had a little over $70, the reports showed. The winner will succeed retiring Democrat R. Christopher Almy, who has held the post since 1986 and run unopposed for re-election since 1998.
The incumbent sheriff of Waldo County faces a rare challenge this year. Independent John Gibbs, a Belfast police sergeant, is running to unseat Sheriff Jeff Trafton, a Republican. The pair propose different approaches to handling domestic violence complaints and the county's reentry program for soon-to-be released prisoners.
Costume customs
Happy Halloween! Have you picked your costume yet?
The process is fraught with potential perils. Reminder: DO NOT even think about blackface as part of a Halloween ensemble. It's racist and based on a derogatory, oppressive practice that should not be part of the conversation about fun Halloween get-ups. Take note, Megyn Kelly. Also, don't dress up as Megyn Kelly.
Likewise, it's a bad idea to dress yourself or your kid as a genocidal fascist dictator responsible for a world war and the deaths of millions of innocent people. Parenting bloggers warn that, in general, dressing kids up as political figures is a great way to add to the family's therapy tab.
In fact, it's probably best not to dress up as a person -- real or imagined. As a kid, I once donned a sombrero, curly mustache, fake bandoleros and a bandana to trick-or-treat as what was then a popular cartoon mascot for a brand of corn chips. To a 12-year-old in 1969, it seemed imaginative. But now it makes me feel shame, both because it reflected clueless, insensitive cultural degradation as well as a spineless susceptibility to corporate brainwashing.
I've learned that inanimate objects are the safest -- and best -- Halloween costumes. One of my sisters once dressed entirely in pink, dyed her hair pink and affixed a chair to her head to go out as a discarded wad of bubble gum. Her sore neck was worth it because she was the hit of that year's party.
Years later, a daughter dyed herself a sickly shade of greenish-blue, wrapped herself in wrinkled aluminum foil and went as spolied leftovers pulled from the far back of the fridge. People loved it, and it scored her extra treats at many stops.
Inanimate object costumes seem to be the way to go. This year, I will just dress the way I usually do, but if anyone asks about my costume, I'll offer this response: That quivering, lumpy gray mass you see in front of you is dryer lint, bub, so buzz off. Here is your soundtrack. -- Robert Long

Texto completo: MADAWASKA, Maine -- The Maine Forest Service will hold an ash log-peeling workshop Thursday, Nov. 15, in Madawaska to look for signs of emerald ash borer (EAB).
The event will begin at 8:30 a.m. at the Madawaska Town Garage, 9 Public Works Ave., and will last until early afternoon. The MFS welcomes landowners, foresters, and anyone from the general public who would like to learn more about EAB to attend all or part of the day.
Ash trees were girdled throughout Maine in the spring. Those in the north will be felled in November and MFS officials will peel sections of the trunks to look for signs of EAB. Later peelings will take place in southern and central Maine.
The workshop is open to and the latest information about what's happening in Maine. All are welcome to help the Forest Service peel logs to examine them for evidence of EAB, and learn the latest about what's happening with the pest in Maine.

Rural health care is on the Nov. 6 ballot

Texto completo: When you really need a hospital, you're grateful its specialized equipment and medical professionals are there.
Everyone in my family has had to go to a Bangor hospital -- after a mishap on a sledding hill, a fainting spell at a track meet, intense abdominal pain or a near-fatal pulmonary embolism.
For people in rural areas, the community hospital is essential.
If it closes some departments or closes altogether, people would have to travel a lot farther. Whether a joyous situation like giving birth, or a scary one like a stroke or suicide attempt, it matters when one can get care.
Maine's rural hospitals face financial stress and, as Maine voters go to the polls, the health of rural hospitals is on the ballot.
Just as people need hospitals, those hospitals are dependent on people who live in small towns and out in the country. If they can't afford health coverage, the hospital loses money and administrators have to make tough decisions.
To solve this, we must first reject a politics of negativity and distraction.
In both Maine and the United States, some politicians have promoted fear of and hate toward people who moved to our land or are seeking asylum or refugee status here.
A would-be bomber from Florida and a murderer in Pittsburgh heard those messages and acted, with deadly effect.
Recently, some pundits and politicians gave voice to a conspiracy theory that prominent Americans, including George Soros, were behind a caravan of refugees and wanted to hurt our fellow countrymen. This is barely coded anti-Semitism.
The killer of 11 people at Pittsburgh's Tree of LIfe synagogue targeted Jews because we follow the Torah's injunction to welcome the stranger and so support refugees. The toxic combination of anti-Semitism and xenophobia unfortunately can be seen in Maine as well.
Of course, there are legitimate issues with health care, immigration and other matters that aren't based in malevolence.
And so a second step to addressing those concerns is to take facts seriously over spin. Yet we have been awash in spin so strong that it barely resembles reality.
For instance, the Affordable Care Act guarantees people with pre-existing conditions insurance coverage at the same rate as everyone else. Rep. Bruce Poliquin voted to do away with that guarantee but says he supports coverage for pre-existing conditions.
With that same vote, Poliquin also decreased hospitals' funding.
According to data cited by the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, Poliquin voted for cutting $117 billion from the Medicare Hospital Insurance Trust Fund. The cut undermined Medicare's solvency as it gave a tax cut to the rich, repealing a 0.9 percent surtax on individuals making over $200,000 and couples making $250,000 that supported the trust fund. Other, larger tax cuts for wealthy people were also included.
Poliquin voted for coverage cuts in the same bill, which Sen. Susan Collins said "would affect our rural hospitals and nursing homes, and they would have a very difficult time even staying in existence." His top opponent this year, Democrat Jared Golden, opposes Poliquin's votes and supports Medicaid expansion. Golden also sponsored successful legislation focusing on health care issues affecting veterans and others, doing so with bipartisan support.
One of the two viable candidates in Maine's governor's race, Democrat Janet Mills, has been a stalwart supporter of Medicaid expansion, and points out that hospitals are the biggest employer in most Maine counties. Health researchers agree with Mills, concluding that Medicaid expansion keeps rural hospitals healthy and finding that closing these hospitals often has as big an economic impact as closing a manufacturing facility. Republican Shawn Moody opposed expansion during the primary and his position has been unclear since then.
Sen. Angus King supports policies that help Maine hospitals stay open, as he voted against ACA repeal, while his Republican opponent Eric Brakey, who opposed Medicaid expansion, does not.
And so this year the preservation of Maine's rural hospitals depends on who wins state legislative seats, the governorship and seats in the U.S. House and Senate. Vote and volunteer like hospitals' health -- and your community's -- hang in the balance.

[image id="2711425" size="full" pos="center" /]
--Incumbent Sheriff Jeff Trafton, a Republican, is being challenged by veteran Belfast police Sgt. John Gibbs, an independent. The pair differ on the county's reentry program for prisoners as well as response to domestic violence complaints. Both agree that communication and community policing are important components of the sheriff's job.
Bangor community urged to fight anti-semitism, hate speech at service
[image id="2711378" size="full" pos="center" /]
--What the Pittsburgh shooter did not know when he gunned down 11 people Saturday was that the Jewish tree of life has deep roots and cannot easily be destroyed, Rabbi Darah Lerner said Tuesday night in Bangor at a memorial service for the victims.
About 400 members of the community packed the French Street shul to remember the men and women from the Tree of Life synagogue who were massacred while worshipping.
If you want to get to Vinalhaven this winter, plan to leave earlier

--The Maine State Ferry Service will adjust its schedule for trips to Vinalhaven beginning on Nov. 4. The last ferry will leave at 3:15 p.m., an hour and 15 minutes earlier than the current departure time for the last ferry each day. Captains cited safety concerns, so the ferry service altered the schedule to reduce travel in the dark. The new schedule will be in effect for 17 weeks. The changes come despite strong opposition from Vinalhaven residents.
St. George's Greek Ball was once the glittering highlight of Bangor's social calendar

--Dancing With The Greeks, which is happening Saturday night, is today's reincarnation of the legendary Bangor party led by parishioners at St. George Greek Orthodox Church.
Do this: Watch Troy R. Bennett's short documentary on Longfellow's empty tomb
[image id="2711416" size="full" pos="center" /]
--The Bangor Daily News published a short documentary by award-winning journalist Troy R. Bennett about the missing family of poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow.
In 1986, the city of Portland went to brick up the Longfellow family tomb in its historic Western Cemetery to protect it from vandals. But when they did so, they discovered the tomb completely empty -- no sign of the six family members, including Henry's parents, who were interred there in the late 19th century.
As a local historian looked into the case more at the time, the mystery deepened.
In his new investigation into the curious case, Bennett retraced the steps of historian Bill Jordan and discovered some new leads.

Bar Harbor voters to consider changing how their town is run

Texto completo: Bar Harbor voters will decide Tuesday whether the town should form a charter commission.
The municipal referendum will be held in conjunction with the state and federal elections on the same day.
A "yes" vote on Question 2 on the municipal ballot would authorize the town to form such a commission to examine the structure of Bar Harbor's town governance.
According to a copy of the town's sample ballot, among the options that could be considered by such a commission are the "consideration of electronic voting at town meeting, streamlining the budget [development] process, and the purpose, function and structure of the Warrant Committee." The town's 22-member Warrant Committee considers and makes recommendations on each question that is presented to local voters at Bar Harbor's regular and special town meetings.
Voters also will get the chance to determine who would serve on the commission, if it gets approved. Seven candidates for six positions on the commission have their names listed on the ballot. The candidates for the commission are Joseph M. Cough, Joey M. Engling, Michael A. Gurtler, Patricia L. Samuel, E. Martha Searchfield, Peter St. Germain and Christopher A. Strout.
There also are six spaces available on the ballot for names of write-in candidates for the commission.
There are no other elections on next week's municipal ballot. Members of the town council, school board, and other elective bodies are elected at Bar Harbor's annual town meeting every June.
Another question on the municipal ballot is about whether a certain parcel of land in the local village of Town Hill should be included in that village's rural zoning district.
If approved, the boundary of the district as now shown on the town's official neighborhood districts map would be moved to encompass the property, which is where Downeast Horizons has its operations building on Route 3. Downeast Horizons is a nonprofit organization that provides support services to people with developmental disabilities.
Janna Richards, the town's planning director, said Tuesday that the Downeast Horizons property currently is split between two zones -- rural and residential. By changing the zoning to make the entire 4-acre property part of the rural district, it would allow the organization "to expand at some point," she said. As it is, the operations building is a grandfathered use in the residential zone and is not allowed to expand on that part of the property.

Texto completo: BELFAST, Maine -- Waldo County residents will choose between two veteran, but very different, law enforcement officers to be the sheriff when they go to the polls next week.
It's the county's first contested sheriff's race in decades, and it pits incumbent Sheriff Jeff Trafton against longtime Belfast police Sgt. John Gibbs. Both have served for many years in policing but would bring different approaches to the job of the county's top lawman, particularly in regard to the areas of domestic violence and the Maine Coastal Reentry Center in Belfast.
For Trafton, 56, who is finishing his first four-year term as sheriff, community policing is a longtime passion. Prior to becoming sheriff, he spent four years as the chief deputy of the Waldo County Sheriff's Office and six years before that as the chief of the Belfast Police Department. He started his Maine law enforcement career with a 20-year stint in the Maine State Police, where he ended up as a lieutenant supervising midcoast troopers.
"My philosophy as a law enforcement officer is to treat everybody with respect," he said. "I learned that early in my career, and I think it helps."
Gibbs said he would bring a fresh perspective on this and other issues if elected. The 50-year-old longtime police sergeant started his career in law enforcement in 1989 when he was hired as a corrections officer at the Waldo County Jail, and became a full-time officer at the Belfast Police Department in 1991. He's running for sheriff as a nonparty candidate and is a familiar face around Belfast because he is a part-owner of three downtown establishments: Katwalk, the Front Street Pub and the Harborwalk Restaurant.
"I've had a very successful and rewarding career, and I've done that by treating people as I would want to be treated," he said. "I feel the community loves the Belfast Police Department, and I want to carry that up the hill [to the sheriff's office]. I love my job, but I have to move on. I'm applying for a better job, and the public is interviewing me. If they choose me, I'll be glad."
Domestic violence
Trafton, a Republican, said that he is particularly proud of the focus on domestic violence that the sheriff's office has had during his term as sheriff. During the past 20 years or so, the sheriff's office has changed its approach to domestic violence-related calls for service in order to take victims more seriously and to hold abusers accountable.
Under Trafton's leadership, the sheriff's office wrote a grant to pay for the salary of a full-time domestic violence detective and has started a high-risk response team to do intensive safety planning for victims. In the past few years, New Hope for Women, the agency that works to end dating violence, domestic violence and stalking in Waldo, Knox, Lincoln and Sagadahoc counties, has moved its Waldo County headquarters to the Waldo County Sheriff's Office.
"We're the only sheriff's department in the state of Maine that has a domestic violence agency in our office," Trafton said. "I can't say enough about the benefits."
Gibbs said that he believes firmly that men are victims of domestic violence just as often as women are, and that he feels that men are not always the primary aggressors in domestic violence situations.
"It's people being mean to people and people not being fair to other people," he said.
According to him, the most important thing an officer should do is arrest the right person when they are responding to a domestic violence call.
"I feel so strongly about it," he said, adding that he would like to look at the task force, too. "I think it's admirable, the work they're trying to accomplish. I think it's important to remember that we as police officers have one goal -- to find out the truth. The second goal is to protect the victims."
Additionally, he feels New Hope For Women should be renamed New Hope for Domestic Violence Victims, to better encourage men to use the agency's services (the agency does serve men as well as women), and said that he is not sure its Waldo County headquarters belongs in the sheriff's office in the first place.
"I don't know why they're there," Gibbs said.
Statistics shared by the Maine Coalition to End Domestic Violence show that 82 percent of domestic violence is committed against women, compared with 18 percent against men.
Trafton said that he would like to continue working to combat domestic violence in Waldo County. There were 342 domestic violence calls for service in the county in 2017, not counting calls that were answered by the Maine State Police.
"That's too many, in one sense," the sheriff said. "But some of that is the work that we've done. We're getting more victims to come forward, and more calls from relations and neighbors. That level of domestic violence was always there -- we're just getting more reports now."
Maine Coastal Reentry Center
The two men also differ, sharply, on their opinions of the Maine Coastal Reentry Center. The center came into being after the Waldo County Jail was slated to be closed as part of a statewide jail consolidation plan that went into effect in 2008.
Scott Story, who was sheriff at the time, thought that Waldo County would be a good spot for a regional re-entry center, and it began accepting residents in 2009. It remains the only county-level re-entry center in Maine, and is intended to serve people who are coming to the end of their prison sentences and who need some help transitioning back to life outside of bars.
The 32-bed, minimum security facility has about 20 residents and priority is given to people who come from Waldo County. Violent criminals and sex offenders are not brought to the re-entry center, according to Trafton.
A 2015 study commissioned by the Waldo County Sheriff's Office showed that re-entry center residents had a 31 percent recidivism rate, or rate of returning to prison within a period of time. That is much lower than the statewide recidivism rate, which currently is about 70 percent.
Trafton said the residents have to do volunteer service around Waldo County and grow many tons of vegetables at the center's garden project in Swanville That produce is distributed to food pantries, soup kitchens and other nonprofit organizations in the area.
"These folks are all coming out of prison," Trafton said. "We need to work with them. We need to invest in them. Teach them how to deal with their addictions. Teach them to make better decisions. Get them caught up on child support. They learn how to pay bills. They learn how to budget. All those things, we work on. This program is wide-ranging, and it's not easy time for them. For many of these guys, this is some of the hardest time they've done. They have to face their failures, and for some people, it's tough."
But Gibbs, who for years has publicly expressed a desire to close the facility, said that he is very skeptical about what it does, who it helps and how much it costs taxpayers.
"I've said it out of frustration, continually investigating the crimes committed by reentry people. By people who wouldn't necessarily be here if if wasn't for the reentry center," he said. "You become a bit cynical of the situation at what cost is it worth it to have people come into this community who are reoffending?"
If elected, he said he would not shut down the facility, but instead make it more cost-effective by downsizing the garden project. He also would choose residents more carefully and make them more accountable when they break program rules, such as using drugs.
Many of the residents at the center struggle with drug addiction, and one resident died last summer after a suspected heroin overdose while he was working at the Dockside Family Restaurant in Belfast.
"If they slip up, they have to go back to jail," Gibbs said. "There are some success stories, but you have to want to be successful. I chewed tobacco from 14 to 42. I understand addiction. I had to want to stop."
Trafton, however, believes that this kind of rhetoric is not helpful. The residents are tested randomly for drugs, and at first, after a positive test, center staff would kick the person out of the program. But over time, officials learned that relapse is part of recovery from addiction.
"We look at the whole picture of each individual. Do they go back to jail, or do they continue?" he said. "Addiction is real, and the more treatment options and methods we can provide, the greater the chance people have of coming out of the program."

Texto completo: ROCKLAND, Maine -- The Maine Lobster Festival board of directors has issued an apology for its handling of the 2018 Sea Goddess coronation and has named new leadership.
The apology was directed toward the community and Taylor Hamlin, this year's Maine Lobster Festival Sea Goddess, who was decrowned just 24 hours after her coronation over social media posts.
Leadership changes include naming Celia Knight the new president of the Maine Lobster Festival board of directors. Outgoing president Cynthia Powell and vice president Michelle Hannan chose not to seek re-election but will continue to volunteer as members of the board of directors, according to a statement issued Wednesday by the Maine Lobster Festival.
"As a board we are continuing to work together to improve. We would also like to offer our sincere apology to Taylor Hamlin and her family, as well as the community for the events that occurred at the 2018 festival. It is my hope that the new leadership team will have the support of the community to make the 2019 Maine Lobster Festival a success," Knight said in the statement.
Knight said that new leadership is "just one of the many changes that will come to the 2019 festival," though the statement did not elaborate on other possible changes.
At a September meeting, the members of the Maine Lobster Festival board of directors discussed possible changes to the Sea Goddess competition and coronation that would "modernize" the pageant. Suggestions included opening the competition to young men as well as women.
In a Wednesday statement, the Hamlin family said they appreciate that the new festival leadership is "taking steps to make this right," adding that they have always supported the festival in the past and are looking forward to the 2019 festival.

Texto completo: A red squirrel circumvented an animal guard at a substation on West Street Monday night, connecting with energized equipment and leaving about 3,400 Central Maine Power Customers in the Freeport area in the dark for several hours.
"Even though there was an animal guard, [the squirrel] got underneath and around it, and got into contact with energized equipment and knocked out circuits," CMP spokeswoman Gail Rice said Wednesday morning.
Power went out just before 9:30 p.m. for customers in Freeport as well as a few in Pownal and Durham, Rice said.
Crews restored electricity to about 350 accounts fairly quickly, and the rest were back up by 2:15 a.m. Wednesday, she said.

Maine's handling of Hepatitis A case is welcome change

Texto completo: State health officials responded uncharacteristically this week to a reported case of Hepatitis A, publicly announcing that free vaccines will be available to anyone potentially exposed to the infected individual.
In a Monday news release, the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention shared some details of the case, including identifying two Portland shelters where the individual stayed earlier this month.
Such disclosure by a health agency attempting to thwart the spread of an infectious liver disease might seem unremarkable, was it not in stark contrast to the state's handling of a case of the very same illness several years ago.
In 2014, Maine CDC confirmed that a food service worker in Cumberland County may have exposed diners to hepatitis A. Rather than issuing a news release, the agency sent an alert to area hospitals and health care groups urging them to be on the lookout for the disease. The agency refused to disclose key information, including the name of the restaurant where the infected worker was employed, how many people were potentially exposed, and whether those at risk had been identified and informed.
At the time, a Maine CDC spokesman argued that releasing the restaurant's name would risk identifying the infected worker, a violation of the worker's privacy. He also said the agency was notified of the worker's illness after a 14-day post-exposure window during which individuals can be given a vaccine to prevent the disease from taking hold. Because it was too late for that by the time the agency was informed, there was no point in notifying the public, he said.
But even after that two-week window, the vaccine can alleviate symptoms of the disease, and patients can also receive an injection of immune globulin to prevent illness.
Even if it's too late to get immunized, people potentially exposed to Hepatitis A should be alerted to the risk so they can be diagnosed properly and remain vigilant about personal hygiene to avoid passing the virus to others.
Hepatitis A can be spread through the sharing of food, cups, eating utensils, towels, toothbrushes, cigarettes and syringes, and during sexual contact, according to the Maine CDC. Infection typically occurs when a person ingests fecal matter -- even in microscopic amounts -- from contact with objects, food or drinks contaminated by the feces of an infected person. The close quarters of a shelter make an ideal breeding ground for the virus.
It's encouraging to see Maine CDC respond to this new case of Hepatitis A with not only greater transparency but also decisive action to protect the public's health. The case comes as several other states, including nearby Massachusetts, are battling outbreaks of the disease.
It's unclear why the agency determined that fuller disclosure in this case, versus the 2014 case, posed an acceptable risk to the infected individual's privacy. Perhaps because health officials learned of this case more promptly than in 2014, that risk was outweighed by their greater ability to intervene with the vaccination clinics.
Regardless, we hope this step toward improved transparency isn't Maine CDC's last.

Two years after Diana Estey went missing, her disappearance 'doesn't make any sense'

Texto completo: When Medford resident Diana Estey disappeared from her house on Nov. 2, 2016, neighbors noticed the lights had been left on overnight, and the front door was unlocked. Inside, they found the TV on, her purse on a table and her car keys in clear sight, according to Medford resident and friend Kent Black.
Her car was in the driveway, yet the 71-year-old woman was nowhere to be found.
Two years have passed since Diana Estey was last seen, on Oct. 31, 2016, and her disappearance has left the tiny Piscataquis County community of 245 people unsettled, Black said.
Estey's family and friends have participated in multiple searches conducted by the Maine Warden Service since her disappearance. And on Sunday, the Warden Service will lead another early morning search for Estey. Her brother, Paul Estey of Bangor and other Medford residents will join in the search effort.
Diana Estey's case remains an open missing person's case, and Maine State Police are planning an announcement about the case next week, state police spokesman Stephen McCausland said.
"It's been two years since she went missing, and our goal is to find her," he said.
Paul Estey said a number of searches for his sister have taken place over the past two years.
"There have been extensive searches for her, with dogs and horses and people driving through the woods," he said. "They also had divers in the pond by her house and the river. We haven't found anything that would lead up to any conclusion."
Diana and Paul Estey grew up in Medford, and Diana returned to the small town after retiring from her career as a university registrar in North Carolina. At the time of her disappearance, she still owned a house in North Carolina, which brother sold last year. According to Black, authorities also looked for her there.
Paul Estey also said there has been no activity detected on her bank accounts.
"A 71-year-old woman doesn't just disappear with no money," Black said. "From an outsider's perspective, it doesn't make any sense, and it's unsettling."
Diana Estey had shown no signs of dementia, her brother said, and she had tested negative for Alzheimer's during a doctor's visit shortly before she vanished.
"The feeling is that she didn't just wander off. There's been some foul play," Paul Estey said.
Both Black and Paul Estey want to keep Diana Estey's disappearance in the public eye two years after she vanished, hoping for some information or leads in the case.
"The two years seem more like 10," Paul Estey said. "It's something that I think about every day, all the time, and there's been no closure."

Texto completo: Bangor writer Allen Adams may have won a rap battle judged by Coolio, as he proudly told "Jeopardy!" host Alex Trebek during the contestant intermission, but he will not be returning for another episode of the beloved trivia game show.
Adams, editor of the Maine Edge and Bangor area actor, took third place with a $1,000 prize in the show that aired Tuesday night.

"I've always had a head for trivia. I read a lot, and it tends to stick," Adams told BDN reporter Emily Burnham. His love of books was clearly represented with a bookshelf-themed tie that he wore during the contest.
Adams attended a watch party for the airing of the pre-recorded show at the new Orono Brewing Co. location.

Texto completo: MOUNT DESERT ISLAND, Maine -- Emilita Arindela assumed her sister's identity, faked her own death in her native Philippines and married four times, with the marriages overlapping.
Now living on Mount Desert Island, Arindela, 43, was sentenced last week in federal court for using her sister's date of birth in applying for a U.S. passport. With the conviction, she faces the possibility of having her citizenship revoked and being sent back to the country she was trying to escape due to an abusive marriage, according to her attorney, Terence Harrigan of Bangor.
Arindela's sentencing comes at a time when immigration once again is flaring up as a political issue days before the midterm elections, as the Trump administration has stepped up deportation arrests and as the president has suggested that those born in the U.S. should no longer be automatically granted citizenship.
It's uncertain where this political environment leaves Arindela. After her sentencing, she's left to wonder if federal authorities will pursue action to revoke her citizenship and, if they do, how aggressively they'll act.
Divorce is not permitted in the Philippines and, as part of an effort to leave her first husband, Arindela married an American citizen in the Philippines in 2000. She moved with him to the U.S. in 2002, and became a naturalized citizen seven years later.
But she married the American and moved to the U.S. while using her sister's name, Esperanza, and date of birth, according to documents filed in federal court. She had her name changed from her sister's name to her real name in Hancock County Probate Court in 2009, after gaining citizenship.
About a year later, she applied in Ellsworth for a U.S. passport using her "new" name and her sister's date of birth. She divorced her American husband in 2011.
Despite Arindela's prolonged deception about her identity, she received a sentence of only 10 days in jail, which she already has served, and one year of supervised release for making a false statement on her passport application, according to the U.S. Attorney's office in Maine. She had faced a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.
Harrigan said the lenient sentence reflects Arindela's motivation to escape an abusive marriage in the Philippines, and that she otherwise has led a law-abiding life in Maine. He said he is not sure how federal officials found out about his client's false statement on her passport application.
"She was in a troubled and awful situation," Harrigan said of her first marriage.
Arindela has two daughters who also live in the area. One was born in the Philippines, graduated from MDI High School in 2013 and now has a baby of her own. The other was born in Ellsworth in 2009 at what is now Northern Light Maine Coast Hospital.

"I think charging her with [only] the passport thing is a reflection of the good life she's led since she's been here," Harrigan said. "Nobody wanted to jam her up too much."
Andrew McCormack, spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's office, said federal prosecutors could have pursued more charges against Arindela, but that making a bigger case against her likely would have gotten more complicated -- and costly -- quickly.
The apparent identity theft of adopting her sister's name and birthday originated in the Philippines, he said, and so likely would have been more difficult to prove had Arindela's case gone to trial. Plus, he added, she was willing to plead guilty to passport fraud.
"We thought that [fraud charge] was the most appropriate for this case," McCormack said. "It could have been a situation in which you have to bring in people from the Philippines [to testify]."
McCormack said that the federal agency that investigated Arindela's case, the State Department's Diplomatic Security Service, is expected to notify immigration officials of Arindela's situation. The service is tasked with ensuring the integrity of U.S. travel documents and safeguarding U.S diplomats, and does not enforce immigration laws.
In a brief conversation last week, Arindela said she is a hard worker who sends money she earns back home to the Philippines to support relatives. She said she spoke no English when she moved to the U.S. and that she works several jobs in the summer during the island's busy tourist season -- when many seasonal Maine employers have difficulty filling job s.
"I work every day," she said with a smile.
She did not say why she used her sister's name and date of birth to get married in 2000 or why she continued to do so while getting naturalized and then applying for a U.S. passport.
Arindela declined further comment.
The complications in Arindela's life date back to the 1990s in the Philippines, according to federal court documents. She married a man there in 1993, when she was 18, under her real name, but then used her older sister's name to marry an American man in her home country in 2000.
She moved to the U.S. with her American husband in 2002 but, while on a visit back to her home country in 2007, she married another man using her real name without obtaining a Filipino marriage license, according to court documents. At the time, she was still married both to her first husband and to her American husband.
After becoming a naturalized citizen in the U.S. under her sister's name, then changing her first name to Emily, she traveled back to the Philippines in 2014 and remarried her third husband under her new name. Prior to this marriage, her third husband had submitted a certificate of death for her given name to Filipino authorities, ostensibly so she could remarry him under her American identity.
A few months later, she submitted a petition to U.S. immigration authorities -- using her new name but her sister's date of birth -- asking for approval to have her third husband move to the U.S. It is not clear whether he ever did.
The effect this history might have on Arindela's status as a U.S. citizen, if any, has yet to play out.
Anna Welch, a professor at the University of Maine School of Law who oversees the school's Refugee and Human Rights Clinic, said Monday that any immigrant who becomes naturalized as a citizen is entitled to due process in federal district court. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services is the Department of Homeland Security agency that pursues such citizenship revocation efforts.
Welch declined to comment specifically on Arindela's case but said that even someone accused of committing fraud in order to become a citizen cannot have his or her citizenship automatically revoked. USCIS has to make a referral to the Justice Department, which then would have to pursue a revocation ruling in federal district court, she said.
"You can lose your citizenship, but it is not automatic," Welch said. "There are due-process protections."
Petitioning for asylum is an option for someone who loses citizenship, she said, including for someone who faces the prospect of domestic violence in his or her home country.
U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who heads the Justice Department, has made it harder to obtain asylum status, Welch noted. She said being found to have committed fraud does not automatically bar a petitioner from seeking asylum, "but it is an uphill battle."
For Harrigan, the bigger penalty his client faces as a result of the passport fraud conviction is not the jail time she served. It is the uncertainty of what could happen to Arindela now, at any moment, a decade and a half after moving to Maine to start a new life.
"She never knows if Homeland Security is about to knock on her door," Harrigan said. "That's her punishment. It's a hard way to live your life."

4 sets of sisters lead Orono high, middle school cross-country teams

Texto completo: ORONO, Maine -- The leaderboards for the recent Class C North high school cross-country championships and Penobscot Valley Middle League title meet featured some remarkable similarities.
Not only did Orono High School and Orono Middle School win their respective girls' competitions, but the top four Red Riots in the high school meet were also the older sisters of Orono's top four runners at the middle-school event.
Leading the high school team to victory were senior Camille Kohtala, who won the Class C North race, sophomores Erin Gerbi (second place) and Julia White (fifth), and freshman Nora White (seventh).
Pacing the middle-school squad were race winner Ruth White, a seventh-grader and Nora's sister, eighth-grader Megan Gerbi (second place), seventh-grader Rebecca White (third place) and eighth-grader Katherine Kohtala (sixth).
"We're just in a unique place where four girls are in high school and four of their younger sisters are in middle school, and they're all running great," said Chris Libby, the Orono Middle School cross-country and Orono High School indoor and outdoor track coach.
While the teams can't see all of each other's races because of conflicting schedules, the older sisters were able to see the middle school team's final meet of the year Thursday at the Airline Middle School Invitational in Aurora. And the younger sisters were on hand Saturday to watch the Orono High School girls win their second straight Class C state championship.
"It's been great to have them come to our meets and support us and for us to be able to support them as often as possible," Erin Gerbi said. "It's also great knowing that after we're gone there's going to be so many talented people still at Orono who run fast and work hard."
Last weekend's title, which qualified the Orono High girls for the New England championships on Nov. 10 in Manchester, New Hampshire, was just the latest example of the college town's status as a small-school track and cross-country power.
At the high school level alone, the Orono girls cross-country team coached by Lin White -- Nora and Ruth's dad -- has won five state championships in the past six years, while producing such notable recent alumnae as newly crowned Southern Conference cross-country champion Hannah Steelman, a sophomore at Wofford College in Spartanburg, South Carolina, and fellow NCAA Division I runner Kassidy Dill, a sophomore at North Carolina-Greensboro.
Orono High also has won the Class C state crown in girls' outdoor track six of the past seven years and captured the Class B indoor state championship as recently as 2016.
On the boys' side, Orono High finished second at the Class C state meet after winning the title each of the two previous seasons and has won the Class C state crown in outdoor track three of the past four years.
Siblings have played a significant role in those success stories over the years, according to Orono High School athletic administrator Mike Archer.
"I think it's unique in regards to how much of a culture cross-country and track has been at our school for a number of years," he said. "Different families have come through, and right now we have a pocket of families with kids having success at both the high school and the middle school."
Orono's current sibling running relationships aren't limited to the girls. Orono High boys runner Colby Pawson has a younger brother, Caleb, on the middle-school team, while high school teammate Kyle McClellan's sister, Ayla, also runs middle school cross-country.
"I just think it speaks volumes about the family commitment, the motivation and inspiration of siblings, and the history of siblings running in Maine," Archer said.
Many of those athletic relationships are nurtured through the town's popular summer track and field program, where youngsters start out as participants and often grow by high school into student-coaches who help the next generation of interscholastic runners in the community.
"Everyone makes connections in summer track with the kids they'll be growing up with and doing track with for the next 10 years," said Camille Kohtala, a summer track coach for the past three years. "It's created such a legacy because it always seems like as soon as some of the kids graduate there's always new kids coming up.
"I think our [high school] success is another thing that motivates the younger girls and gets them excited about moving up to the high school or the middle school."
Both Lin White and Libby are heavily involved in the summer track program, which averages more than 120 participants per year.
"The kids get excited about the sport at a very young age," White said. "Most of these kids started in our summer track program and even from a very young age they come to see themselves as running athletes.
"The younger siblings follow the lead of the older siblings and it's just really fun to watch them come up through the years."
And while those sibling connections to cross-country and track and field are quite supportive, they're not without an occasional competitive touch.
"We talk about running a little bit when we're together," Erin Gerbi said. "Mostly I'm just scared that [Megan's] going to become faster than me."

Maine veteran who lost all 4 limbs in Afghanistan tells entrepreneurs: Never give up

Texto completo: Like many people at the Cross Insurance Center on Tuesday afternoon, Travis Mills works in the hospitality industry. He and a friend own a lakeside lodging business outside Augusta.
But that venture isn't what distinguishes Mills, a veteran of the U.S. Army. In 2012, he almost died on his third tour in Afghanistan when he was caught in the blast from an improvised explosive device. Now 31, the staff sergeant is missing all his limbs and has learned to move around with prosthetics.
He also travels the country delivering motivational talks and was invited to give the keynote speech on Tuesday at a summit in Bangor hosted by HospitalityMaine, a trade group for the state's hoteliers, innkeepers and restaurateurs.
"I'm a little nervous, I'm going to be honest," Mills said at the start of his talk, before lightening the mood with a series of jokes about his injuries. A computerized sensor in his left prosthetic leg wasn't working correctly Tuesday, so with a big smile he warned, "If I fall, don't worry, I'll most likely get back up."
Amid the laughter, Mills proceeded to explain how, at the age of 24, he suffered the catastrophic injuries that would upend his life.
At the time, his daughter was an infant. Afterward, his wife Kelsey and other relatives provided unflinching support during his recovery. A Michigan native, Mills moved to the Augusta area to be near Kelsey's family. In spite of his injuries, Mills also served as a mentor for other injured veterans, eventually earning the nickname "Mayor" during his stay at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland.
All the support Mills gave and received during those years inspired him to start a foundation for wounded veterans. In 2017, the organization opened a handicap-accessible retreat in the Belgrade Lakes region of central Maine where up to eight veterans and their families can now stay.
Mills also has more than a year of experience running his own hospitality business, Lakeside Motels & Cabins in East Winthrop. He and his partner, Zach Stewart, purchased the operation at the end of 2016.
While that was one reason Mills was invited to the conference in Bangor this week, organizers mainly hoped that he would fire up the crowd. HospitalityMaine is an organization that was recently formed from two separate trade groups, the Maine Restaurant Association and Maine Innkeepers Association.
[With tourist season around the corner, Maine's hospitality industry is facing a crisis]
"It's the bigger message of 'Never give up,'" Steve Hewins, CEO and president of HospitalityMaine, said before Mills' speech. "This is a room full of entrepreneurs. They need that motivation to keep going forward. We think his message will resonate with people at end of two days."
The conference began Monday, when the organization presented a study showing that Maine's hospitality industry employed more than 77,000 people in 2017, among other economic indicators.
To try to address a statewide shortage in hospitality workers, it also announced that it's developing an apprentice program in partnership with the Maine Department of Labor and the Maine Community College System that would train students in culinary arts and hospitality services.

Texto completo: Fund universal home care
Maine has the second-highest proportion of elderly residents among the states. The need for care increases with old age. Thousands of Mainers cannot administer their own care, are too poor to pay for it, or lack family members who can provide it. Most of these people would be better served by care at home, as Question 1 would provide, instead of in a nursing home or hospital.
A study by Case Western Reserve University shows that most elderly and disabled persons respond well to in-home care, and that such care prevents hospital admission at great financial saving. Most persons prefer care at home in familiar surroundings. Without in-home care, many Mainers have had to give up their homes to reside in a nursing home or other care facility.
Question 1's approach is the most affordable way to provide care to senior and disabled persons. According to the 2018 Genworth Cost of Care Survey, Maine nursing home costs are more than twice the costs of equivalent home care, and this differential will continue.
Care has to be paid for one way or another. What is the best way, spreading the cost to all Mainers, or taxing those who are best able to pay? Question 1 takes the latter approach, taxing only a small number of Mainers. Question 1 is an opportunity to fix a dire situation, now. The proposal's glitches can worked out by the Legislature. Vote yes on Question 1.

Amend Constitution for ranked choice
It is a travesty that the Legislature has not aligned the Maine Constitution with the democratic desires of the electorate to enable the use of ranked-choice voting in all races. The Legislature has had two years to fix the problem and has done nothing.
Ranked choice restores majority rule because candidates only win if they have more than 50 percent of the vote. If your first choice loses, then your second choice is counted. This allows voters to vote for the candidate they think is best for the job instead of voting against a worse candidate. It eliminates splitting votes between similar candidates and rewards candidates who reach beyond their base to work collaboratively. Thus, campaigning becomes more civil.
Ranked choice does not significantly delay the results of an election. If there is a clear majority, the winner is announced on Election Day. If multiple rounds are required, it may take a few days for results, just as in any close election.
I call on Mainers to rank their choices for the U.S. Senate and House this November. We have worked hard for this opportunity and need to press for expansion of ranked choice to all races.

Mills for governor
You might think Janet Mills is tough and smart (she is), but what you might not know is that she is also caring and genuine. She met me only once. I am a nobody, yet two years later, she remembered my name and everything about me, including that I was substitute teaching. Mills has a great sense of humor and can laugh at herself, which is, to me, a sign of personal strength.
When her husband had a devastating stroke that resulted in his death, Mills learned firsthand how difficult health care can be. She will fight for health care we Mainers can afford while supporting job growth for a strong economy. Don't believe the negative ads you see about Mills being a tax-and-spend candidate; they are scare tactics. She is fiscally responsible and supports business growth. Vote for Mills for governor.

Get Democrats into power
Why do people vote against their own interests? Rep. Bruce Poliquin wanted to repeal the Affordable Care Act and 116,000 Mainers would have lost health coverage.
He claims to want to solve the opioid crisis. But drug addiction is a pre-existing condition that would not have been covered by flimsy Republican health "plans." And pharmaceutical companies contribute to Poliquin's campaign.
Yes, Jared Golden wants to "change Medicare as we know it," but by allowing more people to be covered by it at a younger age, to ease into Medicare for all eventually. Poliquin wants to cut Medicare costs and privatize Social Security. They are called "entitlements" because we worked for the money, had it taken out of our paychecks for years, and are entitled to it.
Poliquin supported the Republican tax cut bill, which were tax cuts for the rich. It was "the largest wealth transfer from the poor to the rich in U.S. history," according to Democracy Now. Golden supports unions, one of the few sources of power for what remains of the middle class.
Poliquin voted with Trump 97 percent of the time. We need a balance. We need Democrats to be in power in the House of Representatives. Vote for Golden.
And please support Janet Mills for governor. This is not a ranked-choice voting, so don't dilute the Democratic votes by voting for the independents. We did that twice already, and got two terms of Gov. Paul LePage.

Yes on Question 1
As my aunt aged, she wanted to stay in her home, but our family simply could not afford it. Her home, her savings, everything quickly evaporated for nursing home care that was less than adequate.
Too many Maine families have similar sad stories. The good news is that we can fix the problem and help aging Mainers and those who love them.
A "yes" vote on Question 1 will guarantee care for Mainers who need it. The care will be paid for by a tax on incomes over $128,400. Some say it unfairly burdens some Mainers. Consider this: Someone making $150,000 would pay a tax of $418 per year, far less than the cost of long-term care insurance, which pays only a portion of the costs of care and can be purchased only if you pass the insurance underwriting guidelines.
A vote on Question 1 is an investment in the quality of life for all Mainers, many of whom have worked their entire lives and who cannot be forgotten in their later years. I will be voting yes on Question 1 on Nov. 6. I hope you will, too.

Maine and Malter face off in Lake County Board Dist. 20

Texto completo: Republican Ann B. Maine, an incumbent, and Attorney Susan Malter are vying for the Lake County Board District 20 post.
Malter said her top priority if elected will be ensuring "meaningful" ethics reform in county government. Malter, of Lake Forest, is challenging incumbent Republican Ann Maine of Lincolnshire for the 21st District seat on the county board and the Lake County Forest Preserve District board. The groups have the same 21 members.
Malter is calling for greater economic disclosure by candidates for county offices and county employees. She also wants all public meetings to be recorded on video.
Following is a portion of the candidates’ responses to a Daily Herald questionnaire.
Q: Is the county doing enough to control expenses? What additional, specific steps do you recommend?
Maine: During the past 5 years the county has frozen the tax levy twice (including this year) and once increased the levy based only on new construction. The lack of a State budget with unknown impacts of State allocations for agencies that provide funding for Lake County and the one-year 10 percent decrease in income tax payments and 2 percent surcharge on the RTA tax made County budgeting a challenge. In addition, new problems arise such as the Opioid Crisis which require new resources. We look for savings based on changing needs, use of technology and outsourcing where appropriate. We have taken the following steps to save money: decreased the number of employees by 10 percent through restructuring including the planning and IT departments; we evaluated the HR department and will assess Finance next for additional changes. Our Accelerated Retirement Option will provide millions in savings as will a new payroll system. We have also expanded our shared services in areas including building inspections and sheriff’s patrol. I am proud that under my leadership the Forest Preserve District has been able to expand land acquisition and restoration efforts in the face of a 20 percent decrease in the tax levy in part by focusing on our core mission. The next county board needs to 1) make a stronger case and engage citizens on consolidation opportunities 2) take a hard look at the services provided by the county, 3) determine which are needed and 4) if the county is the best entity to provide the service.
Malter: No, Lake County is not doing enough to control expenses. The public doesn’t see the year-end transfer of tens of millions of dollars into a general fund for construction projects. This should not continue without oversight. Taxpayer money is transferred from department budgets where dollars were carefully allocated. They move to mysterious black box accounts that can be spent without going through the process that taxpayers deserve. The departments that lose their funding come back and ask for more tax dollars the next year. Major capital projects should have the same open process we demand when setting the budget. Another way that expenses are out of control is eliminating salaried positions to appear to be saving money and then replacing them with more expensive outside contractors. I will fight for ethics reform.
We also should not continue the practice of no-bid contracts. We should certainly get rid of no-bid contracts to family members of county officials and employees. In cases of professional services, we should demand competitive bidding in Lake County, even though it is not required by state law. We should honor best practices that are known across the country as fiscally responsible. Our county has been cutting costs at the expense of our veterans. Lake County’s underfunded and understaffed Veterans Assistance Commission has resulted in compensation that is over 9 percent below the national average for service-connected disability. Lake County veterans lose out on millions of dollars of compensation to save thousands on staff positions.

Meaningful moments from the first round of the playoffs

Texto completo: Playoffs, playoffs, playoffs.
For high school football fans it’s all we think about this time of year.
But before we look ahead to the second round for DuPage County’s 11 remaining teams, it’s important to take a quick look back.
This week’s Eyes on Five reflects on a stirring moment from the first round.
Sahid Strong: When Sahid Rosas Torres wasn’t working out with teammates, he was working out with his father.
And if he wasn’t working out, he was looking out for his friends ... especially his best friend, his sister Carolina.
Sadly, Sahid, a junior football player at Wheaton Warrenville South, passed away on Oct. 21 after a battle with cancer that began with a March diagnosis.
Before WW South’s first-round home game against Belleville West, there was an amazing tribute to Sahid’s life. The crowd was decked out in purple T-shirts with "TEAM SAHID" on the front. A purple banner on the front side of the bleachers read "SAHID STRONG."
Sahid’s family gathered on the field for a moment of silence and to participate in the pregame coin toss. Belleville West coach Cameron Pettus hugged each family member at midfield as the silence endured.
It was as stunning as it was emotional. The silence kept going through the entire coin flip ceremony, finally broken by a voice from the crowd yelling "Let’s go Tigers!"
The inspired Tigers beat Belleville West 20-12 to advance to a second-round Class 7A matchup at Hononegah. They’ll take Sahid’s strength with them.
I never met Sahid, but I’ll never forget him. Not after witnessing last week’s scene at WW South.
Loaded: Lincoln-Way East, Maine South, Marist ... each Class 8A powerhouse is gearing up to eliminate DuPage County teams this weekend.
It’s not unusual for that trio to be roadblocks to a deep playoff run, but I can’t remember another season where all of them popped up in the second round. Now three of our best teams need to stage upsets just to get to the quarterfinals.
Glenbard West (8-2), which routed Bartlett 49-20 last week, has the toughest task against defending 8A champion Lincoln-Way East (10-0). The deepest and most talented team in the state will be a handful for the Hilltoppers, who beat the Griffins in the 2012 7A final and in the second round of the 2010 playoffs.
Likewise, Naperville Central (7-3) takes on a familiar postseason foe in Marist (9-1), a team that’s flown under the radar since a 4-point season-opening loss to unbeaten top seed Brother Rice. A dominant Week 7 victory over Nazareth opened a lot of eyes.
Naperville Central’s faced one of the state’s toughest schedules against Lincoln-Way East, Hinsdale Central and Cary-Grove ... and this is just another step in the process. A very big step, but nothing new for the Redhawks.
Finally, Waubonsie Valley (7-3) — fresh off an upset win over Bolingbrook as a 22nd seed — plays six-time state champion Maine South (9-1). The Warriors are accustomed to underdog status, and this is another chance to shock the state.
Best of luck to Glenbard West, Naperville Central and Waubonsie Valley. They’ll need it much earlier than they hoped in the 8A bracket.
By the way: There have been many recent seasons where Class 7A was stronger than 8A. Maybe not this season, but 7A is still pretty tough.
Which leads us to Glenbard East.
The unbeaten Rams, who have won 10 games for the first time in program history, just won their first playoff game since 1999 — their only other postseason appearance. They dominated Prospect in a 40-14 victory, extending a streak of six straight games of scoring at least 35 points and winning by at least 4 touchdowns.
Everything changes this weekend when East St. Louis comes to Lombard for a 7A second-rounder.
Technically Glenbard East is a No. 2 seed playing 15th-seeded East St. Louis (8-2), but make no mistake. This is a challenge that’s up there with the Rams’ 1999 semifinal loss to Naperville Central, a game won 49-7 by the eventual state champion.
The Flyers lost to a pair of Midwest powers. The first came to Detroit’s King High School in the opener and the second to Washington from Masillon, Ohio.
And East St. Louis is no stranger to coming up to these parts and winning. The storied program, which petitioned the IHSA to move up to 7A, has won eight state titles, including in 2016 when the Flyers burst past Glenbard North, Willowbrook and Benet in consecutive weeks.
From Glenbard East’s point of view, this is the perfect opportunity to prove it’s for real this season.
If the Rams beat East St. Louis, anything is possible for them.
Case closed: Last week we discussed the intriguing playoff prospects of teams from closed conferences, leagues with 10 teams that only play each other. That means no nonconference games and no clue how good any of the teams are until they hit the playoffs. Well, now we know a little bit more about each of the closed conferences.
As we mentioned before, there are nine closed conferences in the state that qualified 43 teams into the playoffs. It was a mixed bag of results last week.
Overall the teams went 25-18. The Sangamo, which features Maroa-Forsyth and Williamsville, went 4-0 while the Big Northern and Central State Eight went 4-1. At the other side of the spectrum, the Southwest Prairie went 1-3 with Oswego claiming the only victory.
The two closed conferences of local interest are the NIC-10 and the Upstate Eight. Both went 2-3.
From the NIC-10, unbeaten Hononegah plays host to Wheaton Warrenville South in Class 7A while St. Francis travels to Boylan in 5A. Glenbard East and West Aurora, which beat fellow UEC member South Elgin in the first round, were the only teams from that league to advance.
It’ll be interesting to see if the NIC-10 and UEC send anyone to the quarterfinals.
Stat time: Time to see how all of DuPage County’s conferences fared in the first round of the playoffs ...

Texto completo: The Red Sox' triumphant tour of Boston rolled into Government Center early Wednesday afternoon, celebrating the team's latest World Series win with a parade that has become a cherished tradition for a city of champions.
On a classic New England fall day, colorful duck boats carried the team past tens of thousands of elated fans, many of whom had staked out roadside spots hours in advance.
People stood on benches, their cellphones lifted high in the air, to get a glimpse of their favorite Red Sox players.
Those waiting for the parade inside Center Plaza offices had the best seats in the house near Government Center, with signs posted in windows: “Go Red Sox," “Boo Yah," and of course, because this is Boston, “Yankees Suck."
The crowd went wild as Red Sox star David Price, dressed in a bright red “Do Damage" hoodie, recorded the festivities from one of the duck boats. As the boat rolled past, air horns blasted and chants of “MVP! MVP!" broke out.
On another duck boat, past Red Sox hero David Ortiz hoisted a gleaming World Series trophy over his head in triumph.
At the front of the parade was a duck boat carrying the members of the Dropkick Murphys, whose songs have become Red Sox anthems over the past 15 years.
A few fans tossed cans of beer to the players. One of those beers struck Niamh Delaney, 20, in the face, and she was treated on scene by medics, she said. She may need to go to the hospital for stitches, she said.
“It was coming at like 15 miles an hour, that thing nailed me," said Delaney, holding a tissue up to the gash on her nose.
One of the World Series trophies was damaged after taking a “direct hit" from a flying beer, according to WCVB.
“It's minimal damage that's easily repaired. Not a big deal," a Red Sox spokeswoman told the Globe.
Along the route: Fans dressed in the team's jerseys and caps, while red, blue, and white confetti was shot out of cannons mounted to trucks driving the route.
During the parade, construction crews working on a building at Emerson College showed their Sox pride with a large handwritten sign hung from the side of the building: “Go Sox."
Kailen Horn, who lives in New York but is originally from Kansas, got a “Do Damage" tattoo Tuesday night.
“I wanted to commemorate this," Horn said.
Jerry Remy at Red Sox Parade: "I'm kicking cancer's ass'."

Terrence Gaspar, 32, pushed a metal shopping carriage full of Red Sox pennants and extremely loud noise makers that he was selling for $10. The Rhode Island man had sold all of the Red Sox pennants before noon.
“It was good," he said, as he pushed his carriage along the parade route, selling his wares to young fans.
Kaylee Garcia, 7, started watching the Red Sox midseason with her mother, Deidre Hiort, and kept watching the team through the World Series.
Kaylee fell asleep the last night, when the Red Sox won the World Series. There's a picture on the sign they brought to the parade of her mother trying to wake the little girl up on a school night to let her know the Sox won.
“She's waiting for her free taco from Mookie Betts," Hiort said.
The parade drove by at a good clip — many fans didn't want to go home and decided to follow the parade along its course.
Once they got to Government Center, some fans sang and danced along with music played over speakers and began streaming away from Cambridge Street as soon as it ended.
At Fenway, the crowd roared when Red Sox manager Alex Cora appeared on stage.
“It was an amazing run, it was an amazing year," he told fans. Cora thanked the team's owners for hiring him last year.
“They gave me a shot," he said. “They trusted me."
Alex Cora: "We scored 16 at Yankee Stadium...Suck on it"
https://d32e4p2yfip7hy.cloudfront.net/wp-bostonglobe/2018/10/31/5bd9d5d3e4b0e1dbeccc3709/5bd9d5e2e4b096bfa765c648_1466500054195-emrowc_t_1541002727098_1280_720_2000.mp4 World Series MVP Steve Pearce grew up a Red Sox fan and said being part of a victory parade was a “dream come true."
The championship was the team's fourth since 2004 and the city's 11th this century.
“You are living in the golden years, folks," Governor Charlie Baker told fans.
Some fans already had their favorite spots staked out hours before the parade started.
Jack Brouillard, 9, missed his school's Halloween party Wednesday, but the Westfield, N.J., native insisted he'll live.
“This is much better," he said Wednesday morning, as he stood on Boylston Street wearing a full Mookie Betts uniform.
Irene Kelley of Melrose snagged a front-row seat just outside Park Street Station well before 8 a.m. She packed a lunch and a book and brought a small chair, which she placed right against the parade barrier.
Kelley said the championship was particularly meaningful since her father, a longtime fan, died last year.
“I give him credit for this," she said. “He was born in 1919 and followed them all of these years."

Texto completo: The second annual Wreaths Across America event will take place in Ridgeland on Dec. 15 at the Ridgeland Cemetery. Live, balsam fir wreaths will be placed on the graves of the veterans in remembrance of their service.
Plans for the ceremony are underway with three additional cemeteries (Gillisonville, Grahamville, and Grimes cemeteries) joining the event to "Remember, Honor and Teach" by placing wreaths on veteran's graves.
Last year more than 100 people attended the event and about 200 wreaths were placed.
"The 2017 Wreaths Across America ceremony was inspiring and moving and we thank everyone who supported it," Ridgeland Wreaths Across America coordinator Mary Wallace Berry said.
Wreaths Across America in Jasper County is completely funded through donations and led by volunteers.
The wreaths are made in Maine and are transported to the locations by volunteer truck drivers.
"The truck driver that delivered our wreaths last year was from Florida, drove to Maine in his personal truck, picked up the wreaths while driving through a blizzard before delivering the wreaths to Ridgeland on his way to Florida," Berry said.
If someone is interested in having a wreath placed on a veteran's grave in the Ridgeland, Grimes, Gillisonville or Grahamville cemeteries, a donation of $15 is needed for the wreath. To personally place a wreath on a grave, email wreathsjasper@gmail.com.
The coordinators for the Gillisonville Cemetery are Linda Mears and Celeste Lucas; coordinator for the Grahamville Cemetery is Donna Hartley; coordinators for the Grimes Cemetery are Sonya Woods and Linda Dailey and Mary Wallace Berry is the coordinator for the Ridgeland Cemetery.
To be a volunteer location coordinator for another Jasper County cemetery in 2019 or for more information, email wreathsjasper@gmail.com.
Those wishing to sponsor wreaths to be placed on a veteran's grave can purchase them for $15 each by sending a check to: Mary Wallace Berry, 1 Pelot Ct., Bluffton, S.C. 29909.

Texto completo: Small Business Saturday began in 2010 with the goal to help small businesses gain more exposure.
Now, Small Business Saturday is a national phenomenon, and small businesses from Maine to California see a direct spike in sales on the Saturday following Thanksgiving every year.
The popular day for shopping at local businesses has also gotten the attention of some national media. NBC's "Today" show will put a spotlight on the special day this year, featuring two small businesses for the special television package.
Small Business Saturday is Nov. 24 this year, and the nation's viewers will get a glimpse of Dell Rapids when the "Today" show features the Dells Theatre on Nov. 19.
"When I was first contacted, I thought, 'Is this for real?' " said Dells Theatre owner Jeff Logan. "But when I got the emails from the 'Today' show from the right address, I thought, 'OK, this is for real. This is good.' "
The "Today" show also will feature a candy shop in Austin, Texas, according to NBC producer Samantha Wender. Wender and the crew from New York will fly to Sioux Falls on Nov. 8 and head to Dell Rapids for a day of shooting, including everything that surrounds the preparation of the 7 p.m. showtime that night.
Logan says a Wall Street Journal story about the theater from several years ago is what caught Wender's attention.
"I guess they did their homework and found us," Logan said. "For Small Business Saturday, they want to profile a business, and they liked the idea of our small-town theater. We are a little bit of a rarity -- a single-screen, small-town theater surviving in today's world."
Wender is an award-winning producer who has traveled to all 50 states and more than 70 countries around the world. Her previous stop in South Dakota was to Pine Ridge, and she says she's looking forward to returning.
Along with the "Today" show, she also produces feature stories for "Today Food" and "Sunday Today."
"I've seen a slight resurgence in these mom-and-pop classic theaters being restored and popping up all over the country," she said. "I came across this one in Dell Rapids and thought it would be the perfect family, the perfect location and the perfect theater to profile."
The movie playing on Nov. 8 when Wender is in town will be a special advance showing of "The Grinch." The inside lobby area of the theater, which is usually packed anyway because of its limited size, will certainly be even more crowded Nov. 8 with the crew from NBC inside, taking it all in.
"We're hoping for a big crowd that night," Logan said. "It's a neat deal, and I hope people come out to see it all take place."
The theater has been in Dell Rapids since 1938 and underwent a major face-lift 20 years ago. A new screen, new projectors, new carpet, new sound, new seats and new HVAC were all put in. But everything else stayed the same, including the art deco painting on the ceiling.
"Growing up in Dell Rapids, the theater was always one of my favorite places to go," said Ashley Munk of Sioux Falls. "The atmosphere and building structure was old and unique, which made it one-of-a-kind. It was the perfect place to watch a film on a Friday night with the family.
"I remember sitting in the back and munching on the best buttery popcorn I've ever eaten, and that's still true to this day. The Dell Rapids movie theater is an affordable and historical place that everyone needs to visit at least once in their lifetime."
The "Today" show premiered in January 1952, and after 66 years of broadcasting, it is the fifth-longest running American television series. It can be seen from 8 a.m. to noon each weekday on KDLT in Sioux Falls.
Steve Howard, a manager at Dells Theatre, helps customers on Oct. 24.

Texto completo: U.S. News & World Report released its ninth annual Best Nursing Homes ratings on Tuesday, and 130 facilities in Florida, includinga dozen in Central Florida, made the list.
U.S. News, a digital news and information company, evaluated the country's more than 15,000 nursing homes nationwide and gave nearly 3,000 of them the Best Nursing Home designation.
There are 683 licensed nursing homes in Florida, according to the Florida Health Care Association, a trade group for long-term-care providers in the state. Of the 130 nursing homes in Florida that made the U.S. News list, 13 rated average, 27 were better than average and the rest were high-performing.
U.S. News also for the first time rated short-stay rehab services provided by nursing homes to patients who need intensive rehabilitation or care before they return home after a major procedure or accident. More than 2,000 nursing homes earned a high-performing rating, including 127 in Florida.
"Finding a nursing home that meets an individual's specific needs can be overwhelming," said Brian Kelly, editor and chief content officer of U.S. News, in a statement. "The Best Nursing Home ratings are designed to help potential residents and their families navigate this important decision."
Wisconsin had the highest number of high-performing nursing homes and rehab centers, while Hawaii, Maine, Rhode Island and Wyoming had the highest proportion of Best Nursing Homes, according to U.S. News.
U.S. News also introduced a new online nursing home finder tool this year.
Nursing Home Finder is a searchable database of almost all nursing homes in the country. Consumers can find information about care, safety, health inspection, staffing and other measures for each nursing home.
"[Florida Health Care Association] applauds the nursing centers that have been recognized by U.S. News and World Report," said Kristen Knapp, a spokeswoman for the organization, in an email. "However, these rankings should not be the only source for someone searching for nursing center care. ...Visiting a center in person is one of the best ways to make comparisons, learn about specific services and get to know the staff and resident culture, as well as the payment options."
U.S. News has been using Medicare's Nursing Home Compare data to build its ratings, taking into account state health inspection reports, nursing staffing and medical quality. But this year, the company deviated from Medicare's overall rating. While the base for Medicare's rating is inspections, U.S. News used a facility's staffing rating as the main driver behind its overall ratings this year.
"We understand that nurse staffing is among the most important predictors of nursing home quality," said Ben Harder, Chief of Health Analysis at U.S. News, in a statement. "With our new methodology and Short-Stay Rehabilitation rating, we have taken several steps to ensure that nursing homes that consistently provide high-quality care to residents are highlighted."

Texto completo: A political engagement study by WalletHub shows that New Mexico ranks 26th in total political contributions per adult.
For a state with a relatively small population, that's a respectable ranking when 25 is average in the nation and one is tops. However, that state was rock bottom on overall political engagement.
With Election Day coming up and only 61.4 percent of the voting age population turning out for the 2016 presidential election and 36.4 percent for the 2014 midterms, the personal-finance website WalletHub last week released its report on 2018's Most & Least Politically Engaged States.
To determine where Americans are most involved in politics, WalletHub compared the 50 states and the District of Columbia across 10 key indicators of political engagement. They range from "percentage of registered voters in the 2016 presidential election" to "total political contributions per adult population."
New Mexicans appear to have been disengaged for the 2016 election, ranking at 47 on percent of registered voters in 2016 and 48 for percentage of electorate who voted in the presidential election, The state was more engaged for the 2014 midterms coming in at 21 for percentage of the electorate voting, but at at 51 for change in percentage of electorate who actually voted in 2016 versus 2012,
But New Mexicans apparently didn't mind coughing up some coin for political campaigns, coming in at the at 26 mark for total political contributions per adult population, and they took time to ensure they and their children were knowledgeable about the politics, ranking at 18 for Civic Education Engagement.
"Civic participation is a key ingredient of a well-functioning democracy, and voter turnout is one measure of the public's trust in government. But there's evidence to suggest a growing lack of political engagement among Americans," according to the study.
The place scoring the highest for political engagement, no surprise, was the District of Columbia, followed by Maine, Utah, Maryland, Washington and Wyoming. New Mexico scored the lowest, followed by Hawaii, Alabama, Indiana and Tennessee.
Presidential elections tend to get citizens more energized than midterms, the study stated.
"In 2016, a record 137.5 million Americans voted. Unfortunately, that number still only accounts for 61.4 percent of the voting-age population. The numbers are much worse for midterms. In 2014, for instance, 15 of the first 25 statewide primary elections reported record-low voter turnouts. Nationwide, only 36.4 percent of all eligible voters voted, the study stated.
Among developed nations, the United States is ranked 26 of 32 when it comes to voter turnout.
"That's no surprise, considering most states don't emphasize civic education in their schools," the study stated. "Large proportions of the public fail even simple knowledge tests such as knowing whether one's state requires identification in order to vote.
"But of the factors that affect participation rates, income is an important one, with implications on both voter turnout and public policy. In the 2016 election, only 41.4 percent of registered voters with family incomes of under $10,000 voted. In comparison, 80.3 percent of those with family incomes of $150,000 or more voted."

Yes on Q6 to cut health care costs

Texto completo: Nevada voters this November have the opportunity to reduce premature deaths, heart attacks and preventable respiratory diseases like asthma. A yes vote on Question 6 will improve air quality by increasing our Renewable Portfolio Standard to 50 percent.
I advocated for Nevada's first RPS in 1997. Although that standard was minimal, it was clear that the economic and environmental benefits of utilizing Nevada's vast renewable resources would stimulate economic development, improve our air quality and preserve our water resources. Nevada was one of the first three states to adopt an RPS and that early action allowed Nevada to become a national leader in renewable energy technology. Our lead was followed and now almost every state and public utility in the nation are adding clean, cost-effective and reliable renewable energy, which now accounts for about 17 percent of the electricity generated in the U.S.
But now states like New Jersey, New York, Vermont, Maine and Massachusetts are outpacing us.
Nearly every day, new research indicates the benefit of quickly shifting our electric production from carbon intensive fossil fuels to clean renewable resources. Recent studies have linked air pollution to diseases beyond just the lungs to maladies such as oral cancer and brain damage.
The American Lung Association recently gave Clark and Washoe counties F grades for air quality. It's clear that something must be done.
Question 6 will lead to less soot and smog, fewer respiratory ailments and not as many doctor visits and premature deaths for Nevadans. It will remove millions of metric tons of carbon pollution along with thousands of metric tons of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide. Those reductions will save Nevadans up to $28 million on health care costs, according to a new study from the Natural Resources Defense Council.
Right now, only 20 percent of our electricity in the state comes from renewables. But renewable energy sources are now more cost-effective than fossil fuels, and each megawatt of renewable generation reduces our current $700 million in annual purchases of coal and natural gas. This existing path is both economically and environmentally costly.
Nevada's current standard provides that we only reach a level of 25 percent of renewable energy by 2025. That is frankly an insulting goal for a sunny, windy and geothermally abundant state like ours. We have an obligation to aim higher and regain a leadership role in renewable energy production technology for the health of all Nevada citizens.
Twenty years of experience have exceeded the most optimistic forecasts of both the declining cost of renewable energy technology and its contributions to our health and wellness. It's clear the cost of inaction is far too high. Vote yes on 6.

Lessons from the seasons

Texto completo: I like to think the weather in South Dakota is unique, but some jokes I read on social media made me question that idea. A post titled, "You know you're from Maine when..." claimed, "when you own more than four pair of gloves and you wear a coat over your Halloween costume."
I thought, "Hey, those are South Dakota jokes, you can't borrow them!" Nor was it fair when a similar joke about Washington asked, "What do you call two straight days of rain in Seattle? A weekend."That's not funny, it's life in Brandon. Only we had two straight weeks of rain in October, or was it more than that?
It seems that every state makes certain claims about its weather, and a lot of them are the same. If you live in the north you hear jokes about having frostbite on your sunburn, and if you live in the south they tell jokes about it being so hot that the chickens lay boiled eggs. These jokes all have something in common, and that is that the weather is crazy. The other thing they have in common is that this idea is actually Biblical.
In Genesis 8:21 God promised Noah after the flood, "As long as the earth endures, seed time and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, day and night will never cease." It is comforting to know that we will always have seasons as long as the earth endures. At the same time God never promised we won't have snow followed by warm weather the next week like we did recently. That's because the natural world was thrown out of kilter by sin. Romans 8:22 says, "We know that the whole creation has been groaning as in the pains of childbirth right up to the present time." Our seasons will have rough edges on them.
So what can we learn from the seasons? Enjoy them, with their crazy unpredictable nature and all, and let them remind you of two Biblical truths. The leaves of fall remind us that as it says in 1 Cor. 7:31b, "For this world in its present form is passing away." We will have seasons, but only until Christ returns and takes those who trust him as their Savior to his Father's house where the weather is constantly perfect. But also learn from the seasons that falling leaves and the cycle of death was broken when Jesus rose from the dead. Martin Luther once said, "Our Lord has written the promise of resurrection, not in books alone, but in every leaf in springtime." So share your jokes about the weather, but remember to share your hope in Christ at the same time!

Willing to defend Freeport's playing in a regional boys' soccer championship game for the first time since 2007 thanks to a team commitment to defense.

Texto completo: FREEPORT -- The rain stopped. A rainbow appeared. Freeport boys' soccer coach Bob Strong ditched plans for working out in the gym and moved his team outside for practice Monday afternoon on their glistening new turf field.
Things are certainly looking up in Freeport, where the second-seeded Falcons are preparing to host No. 4 Cape Elizabeth in a Class B South regional championship game at 6 p.m. Wednesday. It marks the first time in 11 years Freeport has been involved in such a contest, having lost the 2007 Western Maine final to Falmouth in overtime.
"For the most part, it's just surreal," said junior back Damon Butler. "Right now we're trying to take it one game at a time, but it's in the back of our head - state championship."
The Falcons (11-3-2) last played for a state title in 1978 when they won a third straight Class B title. Since 2000, only Yarmouth, Greely or Falmouth (now in Class A) has advanced from this region - and all 18 years went on to become state champion.
Cape Elizabeth (9-4-3) is an eight-time state champion, but all in Class A, and the Capers have not played in a title match since 1997. They ended Yarmouth's four-year reign - and 45-game unbeaten streak - with a 2-1 victory in Friday's semifinals.
One of the biggest reasons Freeport is still playing is because of a defense that has registered six shutouts and yielded only 13 goals in 16 games, never more than two in any contest. Senior Atticus Patrick returned in goal, but only one - Butler - of the four main backs in front of him had any varsity experience at that position.
"Coming into the season, probably the biggest question mark was the defense," Butler said. "Now it's the most reassuring part of our team."
Strong, in his first year as coach, approached his task without preconceived notions. He tried different combinations in summer league action, moving players into unfamiliar territory, not always with great success.
"He played everybody wherever," Patrick said. "We had some mistakes, some bad games, but it didn't matter, because we found the chemistry."
Strong wound up moving senior Caleb Arsenault, who had played striker and midfield, to center back. Left wing Owen Patrick, identical twin brother of the keeper, joined Butler as an outside back. Junior Sam Larochelle, who scored half a dozen goals as the junior varsity striker last fall, filled out the defensive quartet.
Freeport's first four games included lopsided victories over Gray-New Gloucester and Lake Region along with a scoreless tie against Greely and a 1-1 tie with Yarmouth, ending the Clippers' 26-game winning streak.
"I really think our defense is the cornerstone of our team," Strong said. "They've all kind of transformed their attacking minds to become defensive players. It really speaks to the willingness of these guys to do what's best for the team. They've embraced their roles and as they've jelled, their confidence has skyrocketed."
Arsenault is the only one of the four with a goal this season, having converted a penalty kick in a 4-1 victory over Traip Academy. He also takes goal kicks. It took a while for him to realize the value of his experience on offense.
"I kind of know the tactics, where they want to go, the passes they might want to make over the top," he said, "so it's easier to read that."
While impressively steadfast, Freeport's four backs are the only line of defense, simply the last line of a team-wide commitment to making things difficult for opposing offenses. Greely Coach Mike Andreasen, whose Rangers were held to one goal - coming in a 3-1 regional semifinal loss Friday - in three games against Freeport this season pointed to leading scorer Jesse Bennell's ability to control midfield. Bennell has 14 goals and 10 assists.
"As a group, Freeport has made a conscious decision to defend and it starts with their forwards playing high-pressure defense," Andreasen said. "It also doesn't hurt that they have Atticus Patrick in goal. He's a seasoned veteran who is clearly one of the best goalkeepers around."
Yarmouth Coach Mike Hagerty, whose team beat Freeport 2-1 in their second meeting, agreed, noting the connection between all 10 field players.
"Their success should be attributed to their team defense," he said, "not just their back line."
Cape Elizabeth and Freeport split games in the regular season - the Capers winning 2-0 at home in September and Freeport capping its regular season with a 2-1 victory in front of its home crowd, which has swelled noticeably thanks to bleachers, lights and the new facility adjacent to the school.
"I'm excited to play Cape, especially because it's here, with the home crowd and my senior year," Owen Patrick said. "In the past couple years, I never thought I would be here, not in a million years, but we've really put something special together."

Texto completo: GORHAM -- Samantha Ellis scored the winning goal 27 seconds into the second overtime Tuesday, lifting the University of Southern Maine to a 2-1 win over Fitchburg State in the Little East Conference field hockey quarterfinals.
The Huskies (13-7) have won seven straight and advance to the semifinals against the winner of the No. 2 Keene State, which beat No. 7 Bridgewater State 4-0 in their quarterfinal.
Abbie Staples and Dorina Sirois worked the ball down the near side of the field to open the second overtime. Sirois centered the ball into the circle and, after a deflection off of an FSU stick, Ellis scrapped her way to a dive shot for the winner for the third-seeded Huskies.
Staples gave USM a 1-0 advantage late in the first half, redirecting a pass from Sirois. Nicole Tocco tied the game for the sixth-seeded Falcons (10-10) 10 minutes into the second half.

Texto completo: AUGUSTA -- Central Maine Muslims gathering for Arba'een, a Shia religious observance, held a brief march Tuesday as part of the event to show support for the Jewish community in the wake of last weekend's shooting rampage at a synagogue in Pittsburgh.
"We walk together," Kahlid Zamat, who hosted the Arba'een commemoration at his family's store, Mainly Groceries, said in explaining why the group decided to include a show of support for Jews as part of the observance.
He said the Pittsburgh attack was tragic and that people of different religions should be together.
Rabbi Erica Asch, leader of Temple Beth El in Augusta, who with other attendees Tuesday shared a traditional meal of beef, spiced rice, beans in sauce and bread after the brief march, said the show of support by Muslims - and by other religious leaders in the area since 11 people died in the attack in Pittsburgh on Saturday - has been moving.
"We have a really vibrant interfaith community here in Augusta. The Christian and Muslim community has really stepped up to show support since Pittsburgh," Asch said.
Temple Beth El, in turn, is inviting members of the community, regardless of their religion, to attend Friday Shabbat services, which Asch said will include a talk about the Pittsburgh attack.
"We'll be there," Zamat, one of the first Iraqis to settle in Augusta, said when he learned of the event, which will be held at 7 p.m. Friday at Temple Beth El on Woodlawn Street.
The Rev. Carie Johnsen, leader of the Unitarian Universalist Community Church of Augusta, and the Rev. Scott Dow, retired chaplain at Riverview Psychiatric Center, also were at Tuesday's event. They shared food with about 40 people, many of them immigrants, who gathered for Arba'een, which commemorates the death of Imam Husayn, grandson of the Prophet Muhammad.
"One of the most significant things we can do is come together as a multi-faith community, in both times of celebration and strife," Johnsen said. "I think our best defense versus hate in the world is to come together, in these places we have in common."
Carrying multicolored flags with pictures of Imam Husayn and the names of Husayn and his family written on them, participants gathered in front of Mainly Groceries on Northern Avenue, sipping lemon tea and listening to songs on a loudspeaker. They then marched a short loop along Northern Avenue, with some chanting, in Arabic, "Oh Fatima, we will remember your son Husayn," before returning to the store to share a meal together. Fatima was Muhammad's daughter, and the mother of Husayn.
Ali Mushari, an Iraqi native now living in Augusta, said Arba'een is a time when he and others feel sympathy, and reflect on the death of Husayn, who centuries ago was killed by government oppressors after being denied water for three days. He said Husayn was known for wanting to bring people together in equality, and for helping and feeding the poor. He said Arba'een, which is celebrated by millions of people worldwide, is meant to make sure Husayn and his sacrifices are never forgotten.
"He was a man who wanted to bring everyone together," Mushari said. "We walk to share awareness of Imam Husayn. It's a huge part of Islam. We can't ever let the people who killed him get away with it. The Prophet told us to feel sympathy for him."
Hasaneen Al-Amiri, 14, of Skowhegan said Imam Husayn is an inspirational figure - and helpful to turn to if one is going through a tough time.
Ather Oufi, an Augusta resident who helped American troops in Iraq before he came to Augusta, went to the event with his 4-year-old son, Fadhl. He said Augusta-area Muslims decided, together, to add a show of support for the Jewish community after the shooting at the synagogue in Pittsburgh.
"We all agreed, we would stand with the Jewish people," he said. The shooting "was a very sad story. It touched our hearts."

Texto completo: LEWISTON -- The Church of Safe Injection doesn't have stained-glass windows, pews, hymns, organs or an altar. Not a single chalice or robe is in sight on the dark, cold and clammy streets of Lewiston.
The church is located behind founder Jesse Harvey's blood-red Honda Fit - hatchback open - parked on Spruce Street across from Kennedy Park.
The subcompact car is packed with what Harvey calls the "body and blood" of the church: sterile needles, the lifesaving heroin antidote naloxone, condoms, alcohol wipes. Overripe bananas, potato chips, voter registration cards and Bibles also vie for space.
Huddled around the car one night last week were a few volunteers and, at times, people looking for salvation from their substance use disorder.
Harvey, 26, runs sober houses in Sanford, Lewiston and Auburn, and is a peer support coordinator at Greater Portland Health.
He doesn't preach.
His talk is practical, logistical: Here's how to use naloxone. Call 911.
Harvey doesn't have a degree in theology and has never been a pastor. He calls himself a "disciple" of the church, which is not yet formed as a nonprofit, although he intends to do so.
WORTHY GOALS, LEGAL GRAY AREA
Harvey's growing group of volunteers has a Facebook page, the car, supplies from an unnamed donor, and the determination to do the work and worry about potential consequences later. Whether the Church of Safe Injection is operating within the law is unclear.
Gordon Smith, executive vice president of the Maine Medical Association and an attorney, said the Church of Safe Injection has laudable goals, but is in a legal gray area for how it distributes sterile needles.
But church leaders and volunteers are undeterred.
"This is sacred to us," said Harvey, who previously misused opioids and crystal meth but has been sober for more than three years. "The body and blood of our church are the syringes and the naloxone."
The Church of Safe Injection is in many ways a mobile needle exchange program, similar to those that operate at fixed locations in Portland, Bangor, Ellsworth, Machias and Augusta. They aim to reduce diseases caused by sharing used needles, such as AIDS and hepatitis C. The goal is to keep people alive until they are able and willing to get into recovery programs.
The opioid epidemic has fueled a surge in hepatitis cases, with 256 hepatitis B cases and 1,908 hepatitis A cases in 2017, the highest levels in at least a decade. Although needle exchanges can be politically controversial, a 2018 report by the Maine Department of Health and Human Services cites research that shows they are effective in preventing hepatitis and other diseases. More than 5,200 Mainers used the exchanges between November 2016 and October 2017.
Naloxone, which acts as an antidote to opioid overdoses, has saved lives at a time when overdoses are claiming hundreds of lives a year, including 418 Maine deaths in 2017 and 180 in the first six months of this year. Naloxone is now more widely available than a few years ago and can be purchased without a prescription but would cost about $30 to $125, depending on what type of kit is bought.
STARTING ON A SHOESTRING
Harvey said that for some drug users, the monetary barrier and perceived stigma of buying the drug at the pharmacy is preventing some from getting the lifesaving antidote. So the Church of Safe Injection gives naloxone away. The program also accepts used needles, which it keeps in a sterile container and drops off at needle exchanges in Portland or Bangor.
Harvey said the church financially is starting with less than $1,000 in funding, plus $1,000 worth of supplies from a donor he would not identify.
Lewiston has been the focus of attention for the church, with four visits there already and three more scheduled into November. The red Honda is typically parked on the street for about two hours, starting at 8:30 p.m., depending on weather and turnout. So far, a few dozen people have received the supplies. The Church of Safe Injection also held an event in Biddeford in October and is planning events in Sanford.
Lewiston closed its needle exchange program in 2017, at the same time that Maine experienced an all-timea record number of drug overdose deaths.
The opioid epidemic has been a topic in many candidates' Nov. 6 election campaigns, and all of the candidates for governor have touted their plans to address the issue. But Harvey said Maine is in crisis and the time to act is now.
"I want people to be able to make it alive to my sober houses," he said.
The Church of Safe Injection is attracting people like Kandice Child, 44, of South Paris, who is in recovery and has an adult son who uses opioids.
"I'm trying to keep him alive until we can get him help," said Child, who volunteers with Harvey and also receives supplies. Last week, she obtained sterile needles and syringes and naloxone, some of which she planned to keep for her family and some to distribute to people she knows.
"There is so much stigma," she said. "It took me two years to be able to say out loud that my son is a heroin addict. Now I try to help people."
How the Church of Safe Injection tries to help - by distributing packages with sterile needles and syringes - is treading on murky legal ground. Even so, Harvey is forging ahead.
"What we are doing is legal," Harvey maintains. "If you ask for permission, it can take months or years. We need to save lives now."
LEGAL OR NOT, A BIG NEED
Some health care experts don't have the same certainty. A brick-and-mortar needle exchange program must be licensed by the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention.
Kenney Miller, executive director of the Health Quality Alliance, which operates needle exchange programs in Bangor, Ellsworth and Machias, said what the Church of Safe Injection is doing is a "gray area." Miller said Maine DHHS rules permit needle exchange programs to designate specific people for "secondary exchange."
These people are permitted to take more needles, naloxone or other supplies than they personally need and distribute the extras to others. That's a way to get the supplies to underserved and rural areas, Miller said.
Harvey showed the Press Herald a laminated card designating him as a "secondary exchange" recipient for the Portland and Bangor needle exchange programs.
However, Miller said, there's also a Maine law on the books that bans people from distributing syringes, so there's a potential legal conflict.
Denis D'Auteil, Lewiston's deputy city administrator, pointed out that needle exchange programs are licensed by the state.
"Any program, including a mobile site, is required to carry a copy of their certification," D'Auteil said. The Church of Safe Injection is not licensed by the state, but Harvey said as a mobile site affiliated with existing needle exchange programs, it doesn't need to be.
Harvey also points to a 2006 U.S. Supreme Court decision that exempts religious organizations from the federal Controlled Substances Act. The Supreme Court ruled that a church in New Mexico could use a hallucinogenic tea in religious services and not be in violation of the law.
Harvey said the use of safe injection is "our sincere religious belief."
Smith, the medical association executive who represents doctors before the Legislature, said Harvey's claim to a religious exemption "does not pass the straight-face test," but he noted that needle exchanges work and said Maine should try to open more of them.
"We need a lot more harm reduction in this state, and we need more needle exchanges in places that don't have them," he said.
HOPES FOR MORE PERMANENCE
In any event, the idea seems to be spreading. Harvey said people he knows have started Church of Safe Injection branches in Bangor and Augusta, Philadelphia and West Virginia. All he requests is that the church be interfaith, support people who are marginalized and espouse safe injection practices for those suffering from substance use disorder. Harvey acts as an adviser to help those programs get started.
He said the back of the Honda Fit is not a long-term answer, and he hopes to eventually open brick-and-mortar needle exchange programs in Lewiston or other places that need them. But for now, they will keep handing out supplies from his car, while trying to stay warm with coffee, hoods and gloves.
Eddie Greyfox, 42, of Lewiston, said he's a believer in the Church of Safe Injection, a volunteer and a person in recovery.
"You've got to start somewhere," said Greyfox, motioning to the red Honda parked last week on the dark Lewiston street. "This is a first, a beginning."

Attention restaurant dreamers: Vinalhaven's Salt for sale

Texto completo: If you've ever fantasized about living and working on a Maine island in summer, here's your chance. Salt, the 5-year-old restaurant on Vinalhaven, is for sale.
Owner/operator John Feingold said in an email he would prefer to lease the ground floor restaurant space and sell the business itself, but he would also consider selling the building, which includes two apartments.
Feingold plans to list the restaurant at $20 per square foot per year for the approximately 1,350-square-foot space, which includes dining room, kitchen and downstairs storage. This works out to $2,250 permonth in rent, plus the tenant's share of property insurance and taxes. The leasee would need to purchase the existing equipment and furnishings, worth about $40,000, according to Feingold.
Salt has a loyal following among both local and seasonal island residents, and has been an Open Table Diners Choice restaurant for four out of its five years. So why is Feingold selling? The 38-seat restaurant keeps Feingold, who is from New York, "nailed down" in Vinalhaven from early May through mid-October, apart from his wife, Nancy, who is town supervisor of Mamaroneck, New York. "Five years of living apart like this is something we can no longer abide," he said.
Feingold says he's done more than he initially hoped for with Salt and is ready to leave it in someone else's hands and walk away with "a feeling of accomplishment."
Contributing to that feeling is the fact that the restaurant books up every night of the summer, when it serves dinner five nights a week. Most of the staff are locals - this past season, 12 out of 18 people on the payroll were island residents, he said. For two years, Feingold kept the restaurant open on weekends year-round - and kept his staff partly employed. Other years, he held monthly weekend pop-up dinners.
Maine Sunday Telegram restaurant critic Andrew Ross gave Salt three-and-a-half stars in 2016. Ross also named it "Best Spot for a Romantic Dinner" in his year-end roundup that year.
"It's a turn-key operation with a track record and strong following, and the seasoned staff is in the wings ready and willing to show up for work," Feingold said. "I think Salt - or whatever a new owner calls it - represents a real opportunity for someone to continue a successful operation, or for a new owner or aspiring chef to exercise their talents and creativity."
As for his own plans, Feingold says he has none, except for sailing, vintage sports car racing, and spending more time with his family.
Mr. Tuna parks
Jordan Rubin, owner of the popular Mr. Tuna sushi carts in the greater Portland area, opened his first stationary location over the weekend at the Public Market House, 28 Monument Way in Portland.
Rubin's food won accolades from Bon Appetit over the summer, when Portland was named the food magazine's Restaurant City of the Year.
Mr. Tuna will be open from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday through Saturday and from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Sundays.
Dirigo's last days
After Nov. 5, Yarmouth will have one less spot to grab a burger and a beer.
Ben and Katie Grant, owner/operators of Dirigo Public House, 305 U.S. Route 1, announced on their Facebook page Monday that after being in business for three years, their last day will be Nov. 5, in order "to move into the next chapter of our lives."
The pub will be open Thursday through Monday. Sunday will be its last $5 Burger Day. "We're going to get very aggressive with our inventory and pricing," the post said.
Dirigo Public House received three stars from the Maine Sunday Telegram's restaurant critic, who also named the "rapturously messy" Dirigo Burger, served on a housemade potato roll, his favorite burger of 2016.
Look for the big rooster
Montecito Market, a new specialty food store in Westbrook, held its grand opening Saturday.
The market is located at 1102 Bridgton Road (Route 302), just below the Methodist Road. (Look for the big rooster.)
Montecito Market is owned by Scott Rehart, best known for his El Mirador Mexican Deli in the old Portland Public Market, and for Montecito Roadhouse Tortilla Chips. Rehart and his wife, Julia, will operate the store.
The retail market will sell Maine- and New England-made products such as jams, sauces and soup mixes, and will also offer homemade meals to go, including breakfast burritos, sandwiches, chili rellenos, enchiladas, chimichangas, meatloaf, chicken pot pie and lasagna.
The market is open from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. every day but Sunday. For more info, call 856-6811.
Market is hot, weather not
The Lewiston Winter Farmers' Market will be open from 10 a.m. to noon on Sundays this year, beginning Nov. 4 and running through February.
The market's location at the YWCA, 130 East Ave., has parking and a handicapped accessible entrance.
Like the summer market, the winter market will offer fruits and vegetables, meats, dairy products, fresh bread and other baked goods, prepared meals, fiber arts and handmade soaps. Look for a Holiday Fair Rummage Sale and Farmers' Market sometime in early December.
The market accepts cash, check credit card, debit and SNAP (food stamps). The market will be continuing the state wide Maine Harvest Bucks program which provides SNAP beneficiaries with bonus vouchers for more fruits and vegetables. It also has a program that rewards regular customers for their loyalty, and the Seniors and Veterans Day program, which provides seniors over 62 and veterans with gift certificates to the market the first Sunday market of every month.
Get your exorcise?
Finally, a little Halloween fun. If you're worried about your candy intake this spooky season, have you heard about that study from the University of Westminster in London? It showed that watching a 90-minute horror movie can burn 150 calories, the same number of calories as a half-hour walk.
The informal study is from 2012, and was never published in a peer-reviewed journal, but it gets trotted out every Halloween. The researchers wired up a handful of subjects and measured their oxygen intake, heart rate and carbon dioxide output while they watched 10 horror moves.
The movie that burned the most calories (184) was "The Shining," followed by "Jaws" and "The Exorcist" - the movie that's so scary it even turned horror movie queen Jamie Lee Curtis off the genre.
Douse the lights and pass the Snickers, please.

Texto completo: As I sit here recovering from an illness, I am thankful for the medical coverage and services provided by the state of Maine. With them, I have been kept out of the hospital. Without them, I likely would be hospitalized at the moment, a much more expensive proposition.
Unfortunately, not all Mainers have access to health coverage. As a result, they may delay seeking medical help and, more often than not, end up in the emergency room for services.
Maine needs a comprehensive health care system to ensure coverage for all at affordable prices without huge deductibles. Deductibles are a barrier to seeking help. We need people who are sick to get to the doctor immediately to ensure their health and provide the best possible care at the lowest cost.
Make sure to sign the Maine AllCare pledge card at your polling place on Election Day to move us forward on the campaign for health care for all in the state of Maine.

Choose Hammond for York register of deeds
My name is Patricia Mayo and I have worked at the Registry of Deeds in York County for over 31 years.
In the upcoming election, the position of register of deeds will be on the ballot. I am asking you to consider Democrat Nancy Hammond of Lyman for that position.
Nancy has worked for a Maine real estate title company for over 34 years. She has gone through the ranks and is now one of their senior closing agents. She has worked in registries throughout Maine and understands the importance of keeping accurate records. Nancy will bring much knowledge of real estate and all it entails to the office.
I hope that I can count on your vote to have Nancy Hammond as the next register of deeds. She will be an asset to a very important office in York County.

Chenette is striving for better downtown Saco
I'm supporting Democrat Justin Chenette for re-election to the Maine Senate because of his commitment to the community. Justin epitomizes community spirit. He is always at community events. I felt like I knew him before actually meeting him, because I saw him so often. This shows he's in touch with his constituents.
As president of Saco's downtown development organization, Saco Main Street, Justin has worked to promote small businesses, organize large-scale events and help our downtown thrive. He promotes a positive image of our community to attract visitors and future businesses. Justin is also vice chair of Friends of the Ballpark and a member of the Saco Bay Rotary Club and the Old Orchard Beach Chamber of Commerce.
We should elect a senator who devotes time and attention right here at home. I hope you will also support Justin Chenette for Maine Senate on Nov. 6.

Next week, voters of Buxton, Dayton, Hollis, Old Orchard Beach and Saco will have the opportunity to elect a county commissioner. My choice is Democrat Al Sicard, and I hope he'll be yours, too! He has the qualities that one would want in a public servant. Al is dedicated, honest and thoughtful.
Since the position of a county commissioner is essentially that of a member of a board of directors, I think Al's experience in this area is a significant asset. He has been a board member of York County Federal Credit Union for 20 years. Al has also been a member of the Board of Directors of Waban Projects.
As you consider the type of person you want in this office, I think that you'll agree with me that Al Sicard is your candidate.

For caring actions, elect Caricchio in S. Portland
There is no question in my mind who could best represent the citizens of South Portland on the City Council: It's April Caricchio all the way.
She is a committed resident who has walked the walk here in South Portland, focused on the welfare of her neighbors.
Ms. Caricchio has not only raised three successful children, she has worked hard to ensure that all our children get the best possible education in our schools.
She has worked to see that children and adults with disabilities are included in every way possible in the life of the city. She has worked to ensure that the environment that supports all life in the city be safeguarded. She is ready and willing to support every effort to see that our city will be wisely preparing for a robust future.
What more could a voter want? Be sure you vote Nov. 6, and be sure to vote for April Caricchio in District 4. It's in your own best interest.

As a legislator, Babine would prioritize people
I am writing in support of Democrat Shawn Babine's candidacy for the Maine House of Representatives in District 29.
Shawn Babine deserves your vote. In these difficult times, we need honest leadership that accepts government's important role to play in guarding the welfare of the people, not just clearing a path for corporate success.
The incumbent candidate (Karen Vachon) does not believe this and told me that churches, not government, should provide food assistance to the poor.
This is frightening and fantastical thinking. We need real thinking. Vote for Shawn Babine in House District 29.

Letter to the editor: Re-elect Rep. Seth Berry, who works on issues that matter to Mainers | Rep. Seth Berry, D-Bowdoinham, works for the people of Maine, not for his own agenda!
Seth reached out to me as the Maine representative for the American Tiny House Association a couple years back to get some information about affordable housing: specifically, what the roadblocks were for Maine people trying to live "tiny."
Seth was instrumental in getting Maine's Building Codes and Standards Board to recognize the need for expanding Maine's building code to include wording for tiny houses.
Seth drafted a bill but withdrew it, instead requesting that the codes board use its rulemaking authority to adopt new rules for tiny houses, because that process would be faster and less political.
If you live in Bowdoin, Bowdoinham or Richmond, vote for Seth Berry on Nov. 6, and get your friends out to vote, too! He's an upstanding go-getter who works in Augusta on things that matter to Maine people, not his own agenda.

Letter to the editor: Re-elect Sen. Vitelli, who has worked tirelessly on behalf of her constituents | I have a simple point to make as we face the upcoming midterm elections. Maine needs as many good people representing us in our state Legislature (not to mention on the federal front) as is humanly possible. Democrat Eloise Vitelli, up for re-election in Sagadahoc County and Dresden, is one of them. She has been a voice of reason in Augusta, reaching across the aisle to pass legislation for the good of all Mainers.
As a senator, Eloise has worked tirelessly on behalf of her constituents on a number of fronts - especially to benefit small businesses, local agriculture, education, health care expansion and property tax relief.
As policy director at Women, Work and Community (now New Ventures Maine), she created an entrepreneurial program that has help over 3,000 Mainers start successful small businesses.
A vote for Eloise in Senate District 23 is a vote for a stronger Maine.

Texto completo: A civil rights watchdog group wants to join a federal lawsuit over a Maine law that bars tuition reimbursements for religious schools.
Three Maine families filed the complaint against the state Department of Education in August in U.S. District Court in Bangor. The plaintiffs are represented by two national groups that advocate for religious liberty and school choice.
They are challenging a decades-old statute in Maine. Local school administrative units that do not have their own secondary schools can pay a certain amount in tuition for students to go to outside public or private schools. But that money cannot be used at religious schools, a policy that their lawsuit calls discriminatory and unconstitutional.
On Tuesday, the national and state American Civil Liberties Union, along with the Americans United for Separation of Church and State, filed a motion to intervene in that case. Their groups want to argue that it is unconstitutional to force states to fund religious education.
"Maine's state and federal courts have consistently held that Maine's law is constitutional because taxpayers cannot be required to pay to teach children how to pray," Zachary Heiden, legal director at the ACLU of Maine, said in a written statement. "We've helped defend this law four times already, and we hope to do so again."
A spokesperson for the Department of Education declined to comment on the case. The motion states that the Maine Attorney General's Office, which represents the department's commissioner, does not oppose the request.
Tim Keller, a senior attorney on the case at the Virginia-based Institute for Justice, said the plaintiffs oppose the motion.
"The proposed intervenors do not have standing to intervene in this case," Keller wrote in an email. "In 2002, the U.S. Supreme Court made it clear that there is no constitutional violation if states empower families to choose religious options as part of an educational choice program. The obvious corollary to that ruling, which has been confirmed by more recent Supreme Court precedent, is that states cannot discriminate against families who desire a religious education when families are permitted to choose between private options. The proposed intervenors cannot claim any constitutional harm should the plaintiff-parents prevail in striking down Maine's exclusion of sectarian schools from its town tuitioning program."
More than 30 states have constitutional amendments that prohibit state funding of religious organizations, including schools. Though Maine is not one of them, it passed a law in 1981 that bars public funding for sectarian schools. Legislative efforts to expand school choice and give taxpayer money to religious schools have failed to gain traction in recent years.
This is the third time the Institute for Justice has filed a legal challenge in Maine over this issue. The law firm took similar cases in 1997 and 2002, losing both times. The Maine affiliate of the ACLU was granted intervenor status in both lawsuits, according to the motion.
The group saw an opening to try again after a U.S. Supreme Court ruling last year. In that case, Trinity Lutheran Church in Missouri was barred from participating in a state program that reimburses the cost of rubberizing playground surfaces. The nation's highest court ultimately decided the church should be eligible for that public funding. So the Institute for Justice joined with the Texas-based First Liberty Institute to represent the three Maine families, who live in Palermo, Glenburn and Orrington.
If the lawsuit is successful, it would not affect districts that contract to send all their students to outside high schools as a group. It is not clear how many students live in districts that reimburse their parents for tuition at the high school of their choice. Keller said the Institute for Justice has identified a handful of districts with that policy, mostly in Penobscot, Kennebec and Lincoln counties.
The state filed its answer to the complaint in September, rebutting the arguments from the Institute for Justice and its plaintiffs.
The American Civil Liberties Union and the Americans United for Separation of Church and State filed their motion to intervene on behalf of three people who live in Regional School Unit 12, which includes Palermo. The motion states those residents "are opposed to their tax dollars being used for quintessential religious activity, such as the teaching of religious doctrine and training in religious observance."
The plaintiffs have until Nov. 20 to respond to the motion to intervene, and then the judge will issue an order.

Texto completo: Portland is in a period of rapid change, in ways that can be both welcome and not-so-welcome. Every issue, whether it's affordable housing, school funding, taxes or neighborhood preservation, involves a series of competing benefits and harms for city residents and businesses.
In the midst of all this change, we are supporting three City Council incumbents in this year's election.
Not because we think Portland should stand pat, but because these councilors are best suited to navigate the changes ahead.
CITY COUNCIL AT LARGE: NICHOLAS MAVODONES
There aren't many people on the City Council who can remember what Portland looked like when the storefronts on Congress Street were boarded up in the early 1990s, or when there was pressure on the city to close underused neighborhood schools.
That kind of perspective matters, and that's why we support Nick Mavodones for re-election. He knows how far the city has come and what it will take to keep moving forward.
We need a city government to build and maintain infrastructure, regulate land use and provide services to people in need. That takes managing limited resources and working with partners in other levels of government as well as with nonprofits and the private sector. Experience matters.
We appreciated Mavodones' sense of balance when he drafted a compromise alternative to the four-school bond that was on the ballot last year. Instead of committing to local financing for four elementary schools, he proposed bonding for two schools while continuing to seek state funding for two others.
While that approach did not win at the polls, it was the better alternative, because it could have halved the burden for property tax payers, saving the borrowing capacity for other needs.
Mavodones' opponent, Joey Brunelle, has a number of good ideas - especially around making the city budget process more transparent and inclusive. He's impatient with the pace of economic development that creates unequal property.
We think both candidates share many of the same goals, but we think Mavodones' experience will get Portland closer to them.
Council DISTRICT I: BELINDA RAY
In her first term in office, Ray has set the standard for what a district councilor should be. She comes to meetings prepared and asks the right questions. She listens to her constituents and keeps them informed of her council work by attending neighborhood meetings and maintaining a detailed blog.
Ray has provided much-needed leadership through a number of controversies, including the proposed relocation of the cluster of social services on India Street, and the current process to move and replace the Oxford Street homeless shelter.
All her skills were on display when she was able to save the view from the city-owned Fort Sumner Park, which was threatened by a proposed development. Ray worked with neighbors, the property owner, city staff and her colleagues on the council to create a fair process that produced a positive result.
Ray says it's too soon for her to stop working on these issues, and we agree.
Council DISTRICT 2: SPENCER THIBODEAU
Thibodeau is a real estate lawyer who understands how the city can make life better for the people who live here through regulation and investment.
Through issues like maintaining sidewalks, enforcement of snow-shoveling rules or building bike lanes, Thibodeau has made quality of life a focus of his first term in office. They may sound less exciting than some of the council's business but they are core municipal functions that can't be ignored.
Thibodeau's professional experience prepares him to understand complex issues of city business, like working with three neighborhood groups representing those affected by the expansion of Maine Medical Center.
But there may be more important experience that guides his work on the council. The councilor grew up in the district he now represents, and attended school in the city, That not only informs his work on the council but also could be an inspiration to the students in those schools today.
Thibodeau has done a good job in his first term, and deserves a chance to show what he can do in another.

Texto completo: KENNEBUNK -- Incumbent Rep. Christopher W. Babbidge, D-Kennebunk, will be challenged for the Maine House District 8 seat by Republican Bradley S. Ducharme in a repeat of the 2016 election.
House District 8 represents part of Kennebunk.
Babbidge is a retired teacher and trolley guide who has served as an adviser to the annual Youth in Government Model State Legislature for 36 years. He was a state representative from 2004 to 2008. He was elected again in 2014 and 2016.
Babbidge serves on the Energy, Utilities and Technology; Environment and Natural Resources; State and Local Government; Judiciary; and the Right to Know Advisory committees.
Ducharme lives in Kennebunk and is the owner-operator of Shorelands Guest Resort. He also is the chief engineer, U.S. Merchant Marine with the Marine Engineers Beneficial Association, and is an elected trustee for Kennebunk Light and Power.
Babbidge said he supports the right to bear arms, but some practical regulations are needed to reduce access to weapons used in mass shootings, such as background checks for gun purchases and limits on large magazines.
Babbidge said the solution to luring high-paying jobs to Maine and retaining younger workers includes adequate funding for education and financial incentives for expansion of industries, such as renewable energy and biotech. "We can attract young professionals by alleviating their educational debt in return for a residency commitment in areas of need," he said.
Ducharme said he does not believe that access to guns is a key component in school gun violence incidents and mass shootings.
Ducharme said the Legislature can do more to reduce health care costs and that the state can tax each bottle of water exported from Maine to help accomplish that.
Ducharme said education is key for luring young workers, and that training in robotic technology in particular can prepare workers for skilled jobs. "This will lure manufacturing back to Maine because of our youthful skilled and hardworking labor," he said.

Janet Mills prepared to fight labor crisis, revitalize government

Texto completo: In 30 years, historians will look on the 2018 election as a watershed, a time when the darkness of a demographic winter began to shorten, when Maine began to pull out of a two-decade socioeconomic death spiral and the seeds of sustainable prosperity began to germinate.
As longtime students of economic forces that shape Maine, we are confident and optimistic because of the unique combination of experience, character and vision now offered to Maine citizens by Democrat Janet Mills. It is clearly articulated in her economic plan. She alone among those seeking to be our governor has the experience, attitude and ability to bring us together and make government work again.
All clear-eyed citizens recognize that Maine faces a barrage of individual and community crises:
n
An opioid plague that kills a Maine person every day and ravages thousands of others.
n
An education system saddled with declining enrollments, rising costs and inadequately paid teachers in aging communities struggling to pay property taxes.
n
Escalating health care costs while hospitals struggle to stay open.
n
An inadequately maintained transportation infrastructure and a communications network that leaves thousands stranded on the wrong side of the digital divide.
n
A government increasingly captive to bullying and ideological brinksmanship that has left citizens of all persuasions more disillusioned than ever over our apparent inability to address serious problems.
Our most fundamental problem, however, the one whose solution will release the potential required to solve the rest, is the problem of our labor force.
From 2010 through 2017, employment in Maine grew by 45,000, an increase of 7.1 percent. Over the same period, our labor force increased by 12,000, an increase of just 1.7 percent. This differential was great for reducing unemployment. But it isn't sustainable. Employment can't grow faster than the labor force. We can't continue to create more jobs without people to fill them. And we can't get more people from a population that grew by just 0.6 percent over this same time period.
Finding people to fill jobs gets harder as the inexorable reality of our demographic structure continues to unfold. Hundreds of baby boomers retire every day. The challenge applies not just to workers, but to business owners as well. What happens when owners of Maine's economic backbone - its small businesses - can't find a new generation of entrepreneurs to buy their businesses and bring them fully into the potential prosperity that surrounds us? They close their doors, collect their receivables and walk into their golden years, leaving not just jobs unfilled but also community foundations to wither.
If we don't create more jobs, attract more workers, reach out to those who have dropped out of the labor force and keep our small and family businesses going, we can't begin to address our other problems. Indeed, they will get worse regardless of who governs. These problems, combined with the dysfunction of our government for the past eight years, seem self-reinforcing and inescapable.
This is why we are convinced that the election of Janet Mills to be Maine's next governor is so pivotal. She understands the crisis that confronts us and has a detailed plan to address it. Most importantly, she has the experience, knowledge and courage to make it work. Janet is a convener and a broker. She will mobilize political, business and community partners to work with all levels of government in a collaborative effort to address our problems.
The stark contrast between what has been and what could be is why Janet's election is so crucial. The missing piece to Maine's rebirth is a government that is part of the solution rather than part of the problem. Janet knows that, however detailed, comprehensive or convincing a plan may be, a plan alone will not solve our problems. The citizens of Maine, working with a skilled bipartisan leader, is the only way. There is no single key to economic and community development - not tax or regulatory reform, not health care, not job retraining. It is all of these things combined. It is making government work again.
And that is what Janet Mills alone can do. We must elect the leader who can accomplish this fundamental goal. It is the key to addressing all of our problems and thus to realizing the prosperity available to us if we but reach out and make it ours.

Texto completo: Scarborough school officials are assisting in the investigation and offering support to students following a stabbing Friday that injured a student in a parking lot at Scarborough High School.
Superintendent Julie Kukenberger emailed a letter to the school community Tuesday morning, after a news story about the stabbing was published in the Portland Press Herald.
Nicolas "Nico" Blanchard, 20, of Scarborough has been charged with stabbing a 15-year-old boy in the lower parking lot of the high school Friday night during halftime of a school soccer game over a supposed $20 debt, according to court documents.
Warning that "this news is unexpected and may be upsetting," Kukenberger said school staff members have taken steps to assist in the investigation and support the victim and other students at the high school.
"Over the weekend, per our protocol, Principal Ketch reached out to the victim and his family and worked with district leadership to create a network of support as we continued to gather additional facts and support the student," Kukenberger said.
"As we prepare for upcoming games, please know that we have school administrators, event staff and Scarborough police officers on site to monitor the safety of students and spectators," Kukenberger continued.
"However, we need everyone's support to ensure that children attending all SHS athletic events are supervised."
Kukenberger also noted that school counselors and social workers are available to provide support to all students, and she provided a link to tips from the National Association of School Psychologists on "Talking to Children About Violence."
Blanchard was being held Tuesday at the Cumberland County Jail on $1,000 bail. He is accused of rushing toward the victim and stabbing him in the chest before running off, according to police reports filed in Cumberland County Unified Criminal Court.
Neither police nor Kukenberger have identified the victim, though Kukenberger said he "sustained a wound that required medical attention."
Blanchard is charged with one count of aggravated assault and one count of violating conditions of release from a previous charge. He was arrested in September for criminal trespass at the Maine Mall, according to the State Bureau of Identification.
Superior Court Justice Andrew Horton also ordered Blanchard to comply with a Maine pretrial contract, stay off town-owned property in Scarborough, not possess knives or blades, and submit to random searches.

Texto completo: NORRIDGEWOCK -- Both of Maine's U.S. senators said Tuesday that they strongly oppose President Trump's plan to issue an executive order revoking birthright citizenship for the children of noncitizens and unauthorized immigrants born in the U.S.
"I completely disagree with that," Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said in an interview after a media event and tour of the New Balance athletic shoe company. "If you are born in this country, you are an American. To me it's that simple."
Collins said an executive order rescinding birthright citizenship would be subject to a court challenge, and she believes the courts would invalidate the order.
Maine Sen. Angus King, an independent, also responded in an interview after the event, saying he was against the president's proposal. "I'm concerned about any president trying to rewrite the Constitution by themselves," King said. "That's not the way our process works. I think there would almost certainly be a lawsuit and the courts will decide. But the 14th Amendment of the Constitution is very clear."
Rep. Bruce Poliquin, R-2nd District, also was at Tuesday's event at the shoe factory and initially said he was not aware of the issue and declined to comment.
"I didn't see that," Poliquin said. "I'm focused on the 900 jobs here at New Balance. For me, it's all about jobs in Maine, keeping our families safe and making sure we have opportunities. We are here to celebrate this win at New Balance."
Later in the afternoon, a spokesman for Poliquin issued a statement from the congressman that still did not take a position on the president's executive order, but rather said, "We must be strong on border security, we must make sure those who enter our country do so legally, and we must know who is here in our country."
He added, "Certainly any executive order or law must pass Constitutional muster."
Rep. Chellie Pingree, D-1st District, was not at Tuesday's event, which was held outside her congressional district, but her office issued a statement later in the day.
"No president has the power to unilaterally change the Constitution, nor should they," Pingree said. "Just as his claims of passing a tax bill while Congress is out of session were false, President Trump's comments about American-born children are also untrue.
Trump's remarks came in an interview with the news website Axios released Tuesday and follow similar hard-line immigration rhetoric from the president seen in the weeks leading up to the midterm elections.

New Balance ships first sneakers to military

Texto completo: NORRIDGEWOCK -- The first shipment of athletic shoes made by New Balance for the U.S. Department of Defense was sent this month as part of a new contract that fulfills a federal law requiring the military to outfit new recruits with American-made apparel.
About 206,000 pairs of a new model of shoe - the 950v2 - made by New Balance will be shipped in total, officials said Tuesday during a tour and visit from members of Maine's congressional delegation.
The shoe is 100 percent American-made and will be used to fulfill a $17.3 million contract with the U.S. Department of Defense to provide athletic shoes for military personnel entering basic training.
The contract was announced in March after years of back-and-forth between the company, lawmakers and the U.S. military, which had not been following a federal law requiring it to outfit recruits, when possible, with American-made apparel.
"It's taken several years - and when I say several, I mean more than three years - of hard work and perseverance on the part of many people to get us to today, and it's an important milestone in our journey," said Dan Wheeler, an executive vice president at New Balance.
After a tour of the manufacturing floor at the plant on Depot Street, members of Maine's congressional delegation - all wearing New Balance sneakers - made remarks to the roughly 350 employees at the Norridgewock facility.
The company employs about 900 people in Maine, with additional locations in Skowhegan and Norway.
"What a momentous event this is," said Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine. "I'm so excited to return to New Balance, and this time not just to report on the latest legislative development in this endless battle, but to join you in celebrating this success. Our military will finally, finally be distributing made-in-America athletic shoes."
Sen. Angus King, an independent who is up for re-election against two challengers, also spoke Tuesday about his work as a member of the Senate Committee on Armed Services and how he introduced legislation in the 2017 National Defense Authorization Act to ensure the military would consider athletic footwear as subject to the Berry Amendment.
The amendment, passed in 1941, requires the U.S. military to provide its personnel with American-made equipment and uniforms to the greatest extent possible. While the military has long issued Berry-compliant items such as combat boots and service uniforms, it previously had been issuing athletic footwear to recruits that was not Berry Amendment-compliant.
The late Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., was among those who opposed the amendment being enforced because it would benefit a limited number of companies, King said, but King was able to convince other members of the armed services committee to approve the legislation.
Rep. Bruce Poliquin, R-2nd District, who championed the issue and fought for similar legislation in the House version of the National Defense Authorization Act, praised employees at New Balance for their role in creating an American-made shoe that meets the military's requirements. Poliquin also is up for re-election against three opponents in Maine's 2nd District.
"I've been waiting for this day for about three years," Poliquin said. "I know you folks have been waiting a lot longer. This is exactly what should happen. Our federal government has a job to protect us and to help with American-made jobs, not jobs overseas; American jobs.
"For us, it's Maine first, and I am absolutely thrilled to be here to celebrate with you. This could not be done unless everybody did this together."
Employees at New Balance also lauded the contract with the U.S. military Tuesday for creating jobs and benefiting the local economy.
"I'm kind of an old-school girl, and I really do believe we need to bring jobs back," said Tanya Staples, who has worked for the company for 20 years. "I think we're going on a good trail here. I really believe that."

Texto completo: Raymond
Knife-wielding man robs clothing store, takes cash
The Cumberland County Sheriff's Office is investigating an armed robbery Tuesday afternoon at a clothing store in Raymond.
Lt. Donald Foss said a man entered Mexicali Blues on Route 302 around 1:30 p.m. and displayed a knife.
An employee handed over an undisclosed amount of cash before the robber ran away. He is described as a white male with an average build. The employee was not injured.
Police said the robber was wearing a dark hooded sweatshirt and jeans. His face was partially concealed by a piece of clothing.
Witnesses told police that they saw the man enter a silver or gray sedan, which had been parked a short distance from the business.
Foss said investigators are looking for anyone who might have recorded the man or his getaway vehicle on video. The Subway sandwich shop in Standish was robbed on Saturday, but police are not certain that the two crimes are related.
In the Subway robbery, the man did not display a weapon, but indicated to the clerk he had one.
Maine State Police are assisting sheriff's deputies. Anyone with information regarding the Raymond robbery is being encouraged to call the Cumberland County Sheriff's Office at 893-2810.
Freeport
More than 3,000 CMP customers lose power
One year after a powerful Halloween eve windstorm downed trees and knocked out power to hundreds of thousands of Maine homes and businesses, more than 3,000 Central Maine Power customers, mostly in Freeport, were without power Tuesday night.
The Oct. 30, 2017, storm packed hurricane-force winds and torrential rains. The damage was so extensive that it left some customers in the dark for more than week.
Gail Rice, a spokeswoman for CMP, said she is not sure what caused Tuesday night's outage, which knocked out power to 2,903 customers in Freeport, and just over 100 customers in the neighboring towns of Pownal and Brunswick.
SWANVILLE
Owner of exhumed pigs contests search warrant
A search warrant that allowed animal welfare officials to exhume the corpses of several dead pigs at a Maine farm is being challenged by the farm's owner.
The dead pigs that agents seized from Jerry Ireland's Ireland Hill Farms in Swanville later became evidence that led to the farmer being charged with 13 counts of cruelty toward animals. Ireland is accused of killing his malnourished pigs before they could be inspected, the Bangor Daily News reported.
Ireland's attorney argues that the warrant was defective because it wasn't specific enough and any evidence turned up by it should be suppressed. The prosecution says evidence filed in a previous affidavit supported a probable cause search.
HOULTON
Canadian faces charges in disruption at border
Officials say a man from Canada accused of causing a disruption at the border crossing in Houlton that halted traffic for hours last week is facing charges in his home country.
A 21-year-old man from Halifax, Nova Scotia, has been charged with obstruction in connection with the incident Friday, officials with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police said.
A U.S. official says a second man, from Middle Sackville, Nova Scotia, is in the custody of immigration officials. The Mounted Police say the men stopped a police vehicle between the ports of entry at Houlton and Woodstock, New Brunswick, and refused to communicate with authorities from either country.

Paul Mercer, who has headed the DEP since January 2016, is the latest Cabinet-level departure from the LePage administration as voters prepare to elect a new governor. Mercer will retire from state service on Nov. 9 and his position will be filled, at least temporarily, by the deputy DEP commissioner, Melanie Loyzim.
"Paul's leadership at DEP has had a positive effect on the agency and the state," Gov. Paul LePage said in a statement. "Paul has worked collaboratively with businesses and advocates, as well as state and federal agencies, to protect Maine's natural resources while growing our economy. His innovative and balanced approach has helped to move our state forward while ensuring our environment is protected. I thank him for his service to the people of Maine."
Mercer is an engineer who specialized in energy and waste issues in the private sector as well as a former professor and administrator at Maine Maritime Academy. He was the third DEP commissioner during LePage's nearly eight years in office and took over leadership of the agency after a tumultuous, four-year term by predecessor Patricia Aho.
While environmental groups continued to criticize LePage administration actions and stances during his term, Mercer has kept a lower profile than Aho and department staff appeared to have good relations with lawmakers overseeing the agency.
Mercer is departing the DEP at a busy time for the agency, however. In addition to several major rule-making processes and petitions, the DEP is gearing up to begin its review of Central Maine Power's controversial proposal for a 145-mile high-voltage transmission line through Maine to allow HydroQuebec to supply electricity to Massachusetts.
Additionally, Mercer is the latest member of the governor's controversial Wind Energy Advisory Commission to leave office just as the group begins its review of the wind industry's impacts in Maine.
It is common for top administration officials to depart the executive branch in the months prior to an election because the next governor will select his or her own Cabinet members. In addition to Mercer, the commissioners of the Maine Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Economic and Community Development, as well as the director of the Governor's Energy Office, have left in recent months.
The new governor will take the oath of office in January. Three candidates are vying for the job: Republican Shawn Moody, Democrat Janet Mills and independent Terry Hayes.

Texto completo: SKOWHEGAN ï¿½ Musician Scott Cole said he dedicated a song at a local venue the other night to his Uncle Gene.
The song, a traditional Christian spiritual called ï¿½I Surrender All,ï¿½ was the first song he learned as a boy and he played it for his uncle when he was a kid.
ï¿½It was the first song that I learned and a couple days after I learned it Uncle Gene came over and I played it for him and he said I had perfect rhythm and he was always saying that whenever we talked about music so I thought Iï¿½d play that one.ï¿½
Scottï¿½s Uncle Gene was Somerset County Sheriffï¿½s Office Cpl. Eugene Cole, who was shot and killed sometime early Wednesday in Norridgewock. John Williams, 29, of Madison, was arrested Saturday on suspicion of murder. He is expected to appear in court this week to face the charge.
A court date has not be announced.
Behind the badge, Gene Cole was a family man and a music man, his brother Tom Cole said Sunday from the family kitchen in Skowhegan. Tom, 59, and Gene, 61, played music together in a local band called Borderline Express ï¿½ his nickname was Geno. The brothers also did acoustic guitar acts as The Cole Brothers.
Tom Cole, a one time prize fighter with a record of eight wins ï¿½ seven by knock out ï¿½ and five losses in the 154-pound class, also is an Elvis Presley impersonator whose shows have sold out the Skowhegan Opera House.
Scott Cole, 23, is the guitarist and lead vocalist for the pop-punk band, Uncle Spudd, based in Skowhegan. Their initial record release last year made the top 15 local albums of the year sold at Bull Moose Records.
ï¿½Music with Gene and I, it was huge,ï¿½ Tom Cole said Sunday. ï¿½Weï¿½re bothers. We did everything together growing up. I remember sitting around and dad would play guitar and weï¿½d all sing. Then Gene started playing guitar and weï¿½d all sing.ï¿½
Their brothers Fred and Billy also played guitar.
ï¿½Now Iï¿½ve lost all three,ï¿½ he said.
Tom said his older brother Gene started playing music at 7 years old. He said their father, Philip Cole, played guitar and ï¿½just taught us all. It was a family tradition.ï¿½
The family played mostly classic country music.
ï¿½My grandpa gave me a guitar when I was 10 and my dad taught me my first few chords and Uncle Gene was always teaching me little things along the way,ï¿½ Scott Cole said. ï¿½He talked me up so I felt like I could do it.ï¿½
As a lead guitarist, Gene played with his brother Tom in Borderline Express beginning in 1987 for more than 20 years, and after his retirement from the group in 1994, he continued to fill in for them occasionally.
ï¿½When I first joined the band, 30 years ago, it was mostly country and oldies,ï¿½ Tom said. ï¿½Then as music progressed, we progressed ï¿½ we played everything, playing mostly bottle clubs ï¿½ Smittyï¿½s, Melody Ranch, Fox Den and the Solon Hotel.ï¿½
Tom said the band still plays gigs around Maine.
ï¿½They played down in Chelsea last night down at Crystal Falls and they did a moment of silence and performed a song in memory of Gene,ï¿½ Tom said. ï¿½I heard that you could hear a pin drop.ï¿½
Most recently, Gene and his brother Tom, known as The Cole Brothers, played at T&Bï¿½s in Skowhegan every month.
Scott Coleï¿½s band Uncle Spudd experienced another tragedy in recent months. The bandï¿½s bass player, Mike Spauldingï¿½s father was murdered on July 5, 2017, on Russell Road in Madison when Carroll Tuttle Jr., 51, shot his partner, their son and Michael Spaulding, 57, before being shot to death by sheriffï¿½s deputies.
ï¿½When everybody was around, he was the strength, I think, for everybody else,ï¿½ Scott said of Mike Spaulding after his fatherï¿½s death. ï¿½Weï¿½ve had some talks about it and he definitely suffered. Today is the first time I saw him and we had a good hug and weï¿½ll probably talk a little more later.ï¿½
As for his brotherï¿½s shocking death this past week, Tom Cole would say only that the arrest of John Williams has brought a measure of healing, but not enough to fill the loss of his brother.
ï¿½Relief and the beginning of closure,ï¿½ he said of the arrest and pending charges against Williams. ï¿½He was more than a brother. He was more than a friend. He was like a father figure as well.ï¿½

Massive Fairfield project gets government approval

Texto completo: NextEra Energy expected to produce 20 megawatts of energy, enough to power 3,000 homes
The company building multiple massive solar arrays throughout the state has received environmental approval for its project in Fairfield.
NextEra Energy Resources received approval April 11 from the Maine Department of Environmental Protection to move forward with the Fairfield project and is awaiting approval for a similar project in Clinton, two towns just outside of Waterville. The permit, under the Site Location of Development law, requires review of developments that may have a substantial effect upon the environment.
The two projects are expected to produce 20 megawatts of energy each, enough to power upwards of 3,000 homes, and are projected to cost $30 million each.
The Fairfield project is slated to occupy 240 acres along U.S. Route 201, the Clinton project 150 acres between Holt Road and Channing Place, which is near the Sebasticook River.
The Fairfield project has become the largest planned solar project in Maine to receive this DEP certification.
NextEra ï¿½ a Florida-based company that recently took over the assets of Ranger Solar out of southern Maine ï¿½ is one of the largest generators of solar energy in the country and develops other forms of renewable energy. The company is the largest owner and operator of wind generating facilities in the country. It also owns the fossil fuel power plant on Cousins Island and gas-fired facilities. It also works with nuclear energy.
Aaron Svedlow, project director for solar development, said the next step for the Fairfield project is to go before the municipality for approval, which he expects to go smoothly. After that, the plan is to proceed with construction, which is expected to begin in 2019.
ï¿½Things are going well,ï¿½ Svedlow said. ï¿½These projects are sort of the first of their kind in Maine and have been received well by the DEP. Theyï¿½ve gone through the process in a very expeditious manner I would say.ï¿½
The pair of projects would each create about 85 construction jobs for the towns and require tens of thousands of panels. Once operational, the sites would create four full-time jobs.
The Clinton project, sited on private property that already hosts a cellphone tower and doesnï¿½t have much agricultural value any more, will be slightly more visible to residents than the Fairfield one. The energy from both projects will be sold to Connecticut.
NextEra is also responsible for developing a large scale solar array in Farmington. The 75-megawatt solar facility will cost about $80 million. Bowdoin College and four Massachusetts colleges ï¿½ Amherst, Hampshire, Smith and Williams ï¿½ have signed on to purchase renewable energy credits to help fund the array.
Bowdoin recently announced it had become the stateï¿½s latest carbon neutral campus, joining the ranks of College of the Atlantic in Bar Harbor and Colby College. Svedlow called the project a ï¿½great success storyï¿½ since it already has a number of power purchasing agreements. NextEra has said the Farmington project wonï¿½t be highly visible to nearby residents.
NextEra is also working to develop a facility in Moscow just north of Bingham. The Moscow facility, which was endorsed by the townï¿½s Board of Selectmen in a letter to Massachusetts Clean Energy officials, would send energy to the Bay State while also creating jobs and other economic benefits for Moscow.

Texto completo: Democratic congressional candidate Jonathan Fulford suspended his campaign Monday.
Fulford said he made the move for personal reasons. He also said he regretted the necessity to make the unexpected move and would not answer questions about it.
Fulford, a Monroe builder, is one of four Democrats vying for his party’s backing in a June 12 primary to decide which of them would be the standard-bearer in the 2nd District race against U.S. Rep. Bruce Poliquin, a two-term Republican.
None of the other candidates — Jared Golden, Lucas St. Clair and Craig Olson — could be reached for comment Monday.
All four were expected to appear Monday night at a forum in Orono sponsored by the University of Maine College Democrats, but only Golden, Olson and St. Clair showed up.
Fulford’s move shocked insiders Monday. This weekend, he got the endorsement of Our Revolution, a political action committee established to push candidates who promote U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders’ agenda.
Fulford said in a prepared statement Sunday that he was grateful for the backing.
“The people deserve a representative who will fight for their interests, not the special interests,” he said, vowing to work with the people of the 2nd District “to build a better future.”
Suspending a campaign has no legal status. Candidates are either in the race or not. Fulford remains a candidate as far as the Federal Election Commission and the Maine Secretary of State’s Office are concerned unless he actually drops out.
Informally, though, it is something candidates sometimes say before quitting a race. Candidates who have suspended their campaigns can continue to raise money.
Occasionally, a candidate will cease campaigning for a period and then resume the effort.

Texto completo: AUBURN — Mayor Jason Levesque used a close straw vote on Monday to direct the School Committee to reduce its proposed fiscal 2018-19 budget.
The decision came during a budget workshop between city and school officials in which City Manager Peter Crichton and Superintendent of Schools Katy Grondin presented their respective budgets.
A number of councilors said they would not support the proposed school budget.
Councilor Belinda Gerry said she would not support the municipal budget as it stands.
As a result, Levesque used a 3-2-2 straw vote to direct the School Committee to come back to the City Council with a budget that has a zero percent impact to the property tax rate. The School Department’s proposed budget represents a 1.89 percent increase.
However, Grondin said after the meeting that the vote represented a mixed message from the council, and that school officials would work to find a compromise budget.
Councilors in favor, as well as Levesque, said the School Committee should have used unexpected savings in health insurance costs to lower the impact to taxpayers rather than propose new positions.
The difference would be about $400,000, the mayor said.
“If you want council support, we’re going to hold you to a default status of (a) zero increase,” Levesque said.
He said has been “a myriad of questions” from the public concerning the School Department’s handling of proficiency based learning, instructional coaches and more. However, the council was split on what direction to give.
Councilors Gerry, Leroy Walker and Andrew Titus voted in favor on the straw vote, while Councilors Holly Lasagna and Bob Hayes were opposed. Councilors Alfreda Fournier and David Young abstained.
The combined municipal and school budget proposed for fiscal 2018-19 is $87.4 million, or a tax increase of 3.49 percent.
For a home valued at $150,000, the proposed budget would add roughly $117 to next year’s tax bill. For a home valued at $200,000, it would add $156.
“When you get a windfall like that, you need to put that toward savings,” Titus said.
Positions added to the budget for next year include one new teacher each at Sherwood Heights, Park Avenue, Fairview and Auburn Middle and Edward Little High schools. The total is $383,420.
There is also roughly $300,000 for two part-time guidance counselors, two interventionists and one instructional coach.
Levesque, Walker and Gerry said they had recently received calls from multiple constituents with concerns about budget increases, as well as any positions that would support proficiency-based learning. The system has come under increased scrutiny in Auburn, as well as other Maine districts.
“Personally, in listening to taxpayers, I can’t support this budget. I personally want to see a zero impact,” Walker said.
School officials, including Grondin, said the added positions are going directly to support students, and would reduce class sizes.
Councilor Fournier said constituents have told her they can’t keep up with high taxes, but said in her experience, the class sizes proposed with the new positions, about 20 students per teacher, “are excellent numbers.”
Hayes argued that the School Department plays an important role in attracting young families to a city, and compared the city’s proposed impact on the tax rate to the School Department’s.
“It is relative,” he said. The city’s proposed tax increase is 4.3 percent.
Grondin told councilors that the School Department did not receive any direction from the council during its first joint budget meeting.
School Committee Chairman Tom Kendall said the committee’s ultimate interest is students. Rebutting a previous comment from Levesque about a lack of planning, he said the committee came to the city with a plan to add positions to help students.
“To say we don’t have plan is absolutely inaccurate,” he said.
Broken down, the proposed municipal budget is $43.4 million, an increase of $1.5 million, while the school budget is $43.99 million, an increase of $2.2 million from this year.
However, the School Department is expecting a $1.9 million increase in state subsidy, offsetting much of the increase.
The majority of the School Department’s expenses – $32.9 million – are for salaries and benefits.
In his presentation materials, Crichton said his goal was to “strike a careful balance between the needs of the departments with the importance of having as minimal an impact on the taxpayer as possible.”
He said, “All of us involved, from department heads to myself, we’re all trying to balance it. We understand it, and we try to strike that balance, which isn’t always an easy thing to do.
Much of the increased expenses on the city side, Crichton said, come from salaries and benefits. He said the city’s health insurance rates went up 16 percent, meaning the city will focus on wellness programs. He said drafting a new strategic plan, which has already begun, will help spur economic development.
In next year’s budget there is also $25,000 for a compensation study, which Crichton originally proposed last year after employees from Auburn Public Services picketed outside Auburn Hall.
Crichton also announced two organizational changes. The departments of Recreation, the Norway Savings Bank Arena and the Ingersoll Turf Facility will be one department known as the Recreation and Sports Facility Department, and the Auburn Police Activities League Center will become part of the Recreation Department.
The budget includes $9.9 million in capital spending, the majority going toward Public Services equipment and paving projects, economic and community development projects and school maintenance.
A joint resolution urging the city manager and superintendent of schools to collaborate to find savings in the budget received unanimous support from the City Council on April 10. A resolution has no binding impact, but is meant as an official statement of policy.
The language of the resolution directs city and school staff “to consider, and when appropriate, develop a plan to collaborate in order to achieve savings and (or) improved services that are consistent with Maine law.”
The first reading on the fiscal 2018-19 budget is Monday, June 4, with a final reading on June 18.
The City Council and School Committee will hold another joint meeting May 14, when the City Council is set to vote on the school budget.

Texto completo: PERU — The Board of Selectpersons on Monday evening prepared for a special town meeting Tuesday for voters to decide whether to take surplus money to cover a $26,000 shortfall in the 2017-18 municipal budget.
The meeting begins at 6 p.m. in the Town Office.
The board also discussed the recommendation of Road Commissioner Brad Hutchings to hire an equipment operator and heavy maintenance mechanic.
The board agreed on the candidate Hutchings recommended, but not on Hutchings’ proposed hourly wage of $16, with a 50-cent per hour raise after a first review.
Chairwoman Raquel Welch said the previous employee made $15.79.
The board voted to offer $15 per hour, with a 50-cent raise after a six-month probation.
Board member Carol Roach said the proposed budget for 2018-19 includes a 2.5 percent increase for all road workers beginning July 1.
Hutchings will call the candidate to offer the position.
The board accepted the resignation of Animal Control Officer Cory Marquis, effective May 11. Marquis cited scheduling conflicts and an inability to obtain the required certifications within six months of being hired.
The board voted to advertise the position through the Maine Municipal Association and the Maine Department of Labor and include that the town intends to pay for the required training and certification.
Fire Chief Bill Hussey told the board his department has already received 40 calls this year, which is unusual, considering the town usually gets 60 to 70 for the entire year.
Ryan and Amanda Putnam from the town recreation field were present to ask the board to approve a $500 donation to the Dixfield Recreation Department. According to Amanda Putnam, about 50 youngsters from Peru participate in Dixfield sports teams, and the donation will help pay for uniforms and equipment.
Putnam said youngsters from Canton and Carthage also play on those teams, and Canton donates $500, while Carthage donates $1,200.
The board voted to approve the $500 donation.
Town Clerk Vera Parent said advised the board that there are more than 400 accounts that owe taxes and she has sent letters to those property owners.
“We’ll hopefully get some more income that way,” Parent said.

Paris residents get info on marijuana law

Texto completo: PARIS — District Attorney Andrew Robinson told residents Monday night at a public hearing on a town recreational marijuana ordinance that “it won’t just be a free-for-all just because retail marijuana is legal.”
“There are still going to be some strict regulations on the state level, strict regulations with municipalities, and people still need to comply with the rules or they’re breaking the law,” Robinson said. “Determining who is out of compliance and how to pursue it is all new.”
Police Chief Hartley “Skip” Mowatt said, “Right now, we’re not sure who will be responsible for policing” the new law. “Once the state sets the law and the rules for the law, the task force will sit down and figure how how we’ll deal with it.”
Robinson said enforcement will likely “be similar to liquor enforcement. There will probably be an enforcement division of some kind for marijuana. There may be inspections at times, too, to make sure that establishments are abiding by the law.”
Code Enforcement Officer Kingston Brown said the purpose of the hearing was to discuss a retail marijuana ordinance that sets parameters on locations, licensing and operations. The ordinance covers retail marijuana cultivation facilities, stores, product manufacturing and testing facilities, he said. Marijuana social clubs will be “prohibited,” he said.
The ordinance states that any person who has been a resident of Maine for at least four years, is 21 years old or older, undergoes a background check, and has at least 10 percent ownership in the establishment, can apply for a license to operate a retail marijuana establishment.
Board of Selectmen Chairman Rusty Brackett asked whether any of the taxes going to the state will filter down to municipalities.
Brown said it was his understanding that all of the taxes are going to the state.
“The licensing fees are the only thing that the towns can receive from this,” he said. “Nothing comes down to the local level from the state.”
A few residents attended the hearing at the Paris Fire Station.
Another public hearing on the ordinance will be held at 6 p.m. Monday, May 21, at the Fire Station. Residents will vote on the ordinance Tuesday, June 12, according to Sarah Glynn of the town’s ad-hoc committee on recreational marijuana.

Franklin County communications center director to retire June 30

Texto completo: FARMINGTON — Stanley “Stan” Wheeler, director of the Franklin County Regional Communications Center, plans to retire June 30.
Wheeler, 68, of Farmington submitted his letter of intent to retire to county commissioners on Monday.
He was hired as director of the dispatch center on Nov. 27, 2013. He started in 2000 as a dispatcher in Livermore Falls and has been with the county since 2006.
Wheeler also spearheaded a dispatch building committee to get a new center built across from the Sheriff’s Office building. It opened in April 2014 as a regional communications center.
County dispatching services had previously been under the control of the sheriff and had been in the Sheriff’s Office on County Way.
“I will be 69 this summer and it is time to move on,” Wheeler said Monday.
He plans to enjoy retirement. His wife, Donna, also recently retired, he said.
“I’m going to fish a lot and do some traveling,” Wheeler said.
He was born in Germany and moved to Virginia when he was 5 years old. During his career, he was marketing manager of business paper for Mead Corp. and oversaw a $15 million budget.
He moved to Maine in 1988 to attend the Bangor Theological Seminary to become a minister.
He has been chaplain for the Farmington Fire Rescue Department for many years.
“One of the first tasks I undertook was to upgrade and revitalize the communications system,” Wheeler wrote in his letter to commissioners. “For many years, no one had paid attention to the ‘system’ and instead had just attempted to add ‘band-aid’ fixes whenever a problem arose. What was needed was systematic approach to communications and an attempt to catch up for the many years of neglect.”
Among the upgrades was the procurement of a taller tower on Mosher Hill in Farmington that was suited to the county’s needs.
They “successfully rebuilt the entire site to include far greater output power, a whole new ‘filtered’ radio system that eliminated much of the static and other issues we experienced, and provided a Radio Over Internet Protocol backbone for our system,” Wheeler wrote.
Additionally, working with Tim Hardy, director of the county Emergency Management Agency, Wheeler said he was able to tie-in to the Maine Emergency Management Agency radio network which has “given us the ability to provide radio coverage in many of the areas of Franklin County which were previously inaccessible,” according to Wheeler.
The aging radio console was replaced with a new digital console that firmed up the center’s radio over internet protocol.
“Although we did experience problems with that console for a longer period of time than we would have liked, those problems are now behind us and we can look forward to a long period of time when that equipment will serve us well,” Wheeler wrote.
Wheeler also obtained an additional two-year extended warranty on the new console.
“Overall, I am very proud of what I have been able to accomplish in a relatively short period of time and feel that I have made a positive impact for Franklin County Regional Communications Center and will be leaving it in better shape than when I arrived,” Wheeler wrote. “It has been a privilege for me to be able to service the citizens of Franklin County in this capacity.”
Wheeler pledged to do everything he can to make the upcoming transition to a new director as smooth as possible.

Efforts launched to raise money for family of boys who fell into the Androscoggin River

Texto completo: AUBURN — Police said two fundraising websites have been approved by the family of two young boys who fell into the Androscoggin River last week, one of whom is still missing, the other hospitalized.
Auburn Deputy Police Chief Jason Moen confirmed that a Facebook page has been created by the boys’ aunt, Michelle Naous, that can be found at www.gofundme.com/for-two-beautiful-children. Naous of Hallowell is the sister-in-law of the boys’ mother, Helena Gagliano-McFarland.
The brother of the boys’ father, Jason McFarland, also created a fundraising website. Shawn Thomas of Augusta has organized a fundraising page at www.youcaring.com/scottemileandfamily-1177282.
Naous’ GoFundMe page had raised more than $2,000 by Monday evening as had Thomas’ page, which purports to be raising money for Scott Emile and family. The goal of both fundraisers is $5,000.
The Sun Journal checked with local police for confirmation that both fundraising efforts are legitimate. Moen said they were.
According to information published at those websites and links, the parents of the two boys met in Italy and married in December 2007. McFarland had served two tours of duty in Iraq, the latter in 2009.
In 2012, the couple opened Gagliano’s Bistro on Water Street in Augusta, a family restaurant that served authentic Italian food. The couple held charitable and community events there, including dropping their own version of the New Year’s ball, which McFarland himself had built. Three years later, they were forced to close because of code violations in the building owned by their landlord.
Gagliano-McFarland has worked as an interpreter at St. Mary’s Regional Medical Center in Lewiston since last year. According to her Facebook page, she also works as an interpreter for Maine Judicial Branch and Catholic Charities.
The two fundraising pages contain conflicting information about the family and the events that occurred on the evening of April 24, the day the two boys fell into the river.
One of the pages says the older boy is 10 years old, he other 9. Police had reported that the older brother, who was last listed in stable condition at Maine Medical Center in Portland, is 9.
The younger brother, who is 5 years old, was at Bonney Park, tossing rocks in the river in one version of events. In another, he was fishing with his father and older brother. In one version, Gagliano-McFarland was at the riverbank with her children. In another version, she was absent.
According to Moen’s initial report, the two brothers had fallen into the river and their sister and father attempted to pull the boys from the water but were unsuccessful.
The 9-year-old brother was pulled from the water about 30 minutes after the first call came in Tuesday, and was eventually taken by LifeFlight to Maine Medical Center in Portland.
He was in critical condition until Friday, when Moen announced he had improved to stable condition.
Search efforts for the 5-year-old were in full force until the weekend, when the search was scaled back due to weather and resources.
On Monday, Moen reported that the Maine Warden Service would continue to monitor the river with boat and aircraft patrols for the immediate future.

Texto completo: LIVERMORE FALLS — Like many of his spring sports peers, Spruce Mountain senior Jordy Daigle is balancing enjoying his last days of high school with preparing for his future.
“It’s been a lot on my mind, for sure,” he said. “It’s tough to balance planning the next four years of your life and, at the same time, I still want to finish baseball strong.”
What separates Daigle from most of his peers is planning for his future involves choosing between a pair of Ivy League schools — Harvard and Columbia.
Daigle plans to study chemical engineering. Following recent visits to both campuses, he is leaning heavily to the Crimson, but hasn’t made his decision official.
Having missed a couple of practices for those visits, he’s glad to be back in the swing of things with the Phoenix. But even though he has some pretty big plans for his final season, he’s in no rush to take his final diamond exams.
“We’re definitely looking to make a deep playoff run, but I don’t think we’re entirely focused on getting to the playoffs right now,” he said. “We’ve got to get some regular season wins and get out some of those early-season jitters and everything that comes along with spring baseball in Maine.”
Daigle has spent the last four springs with Spruce Mountain’s varsity. Last year, he emerged as the Phoenix’s ace — and was named the MVP of a senior-laden team — after posting a microscopic 0.92 ERA and walking just three batters all season, including playoffs.
Command of the strike zone is one thing, but disrupting the hitter’s timing is the essence of pitching. Daigle has the baseball IQ and experience to recognize he needed to do more of that this season.
“I’ve tried to incorporate new pitches this year,” he said. “I worked on some off-speed stuff. I’ve usually been a two pitch guy, so I’m just trying to change speeds a little more often.”
Daigle plays third base when he’s not pitching and has moved up from the lower part of the batting order to the No. 2 spot in a lineup that uses its speed to manufacture runs.
Batting in the two-hole in that kind of offense often means sacrificing yourself to move runners up. Spruce Mountain coach Brian Dube thinks he has the perfect player for the job.
“He does all of the little things right,” Dube said. “Overall, he’s pretty quiet. He goes about his business and leads by example.”
A member of Spruce Mountain’s state championship Envirothon team, Daigle hopes to ultimately pursue a career in renewable energy.
“It’s a growing area,” he said. “The intersection of chemistry and engineering is a great area to be in. Technology is increasing at such a rapid rate and global warming is becoming more of an issue. That’s the future, I think.”
As he nears his college decision, Daigle is pondering a more immediate future where he is expanding his horizons.
“I love small town Maine. It’s sort of who I am,” he said. “But at the same time, there are just so many more opportunities (in the world). It’s something I’ve worked toward and this is a good time in your life to try new things. Why not branch out and meet some new people?”

Texto completo: What: Appleton North High School presents "Almost, Maine"
When: 7:30 p.m. May 2-4; 1 and 7:30 p.m. May 5; and 1 p.m. May 6
Where: Appleton North High School auditorium.
Admission: $10. Tickets are available at the door one hour before each performance. Advanced tickets may be purchased at the box office 3:30 to 5:30 p.m. April 30 and May 3. For more information, visit www.appletonnorththeatre.com.
Background: Almost, Maine, is a town that's so far north, it's almost not in the United States — it's almost in Canada. And it almost doesn't exist, because its residents never got around to getting organized. So it's just ... Almost. One cold, clear Friday night in the middle of winter, Almost's residents find themselves falling in and out of love in the strangest ways. Love is lost, found and confounded. And life for the people of Almost, Maine, will never be the same.
What they're saying: "'Almost, Maine,' is a wonderful romantic comedy," said senior Lexi Asare, a student director.
"The stories are sweet without being too cute and resonate with what it's really like to fall in love in the world we live in today. There's something about love that's magical, but at the same time it's hard work, and 'Almost, Maine' doesn't shy away from that but showcases it."
Take-home message: "'Almost, Maine' is currently one of the most-produced plays in America and the most popular play among high schools in the nation," said Ron Parker, Appleton North theatre director.
"It was written by New York actor and playwright John Cariani and features eight short vignettes, each about a different aspect of love and relationships set against the backdrop of this tiny, northeastern town and each including a unique, magical twist."
CAPTION:

Texto completo: A passenger-train advocate from Maine will be this year's featured guest speaker during Toledo's National Train Day event Saturday, which as in the past will include operating model-train layouts, display booths, and other train-themed activities.
Richard Rudolph retired in 1996 as an academic dean at the University of Massachusetts, Boston and then founded a nonprofit organic farm in Steep Falls, Maine, that established cooperative programs with schools and senior-housing sites in that state.
But it is his lifelong interest in passenger rail that brings him to Toledo. He was a founding member and chairman of Amtrak's Customer Service Committee and is chairman of the Rail Users' Network, a nationwide advocacy organization.
He and local rail advocates and public officials will speak and participate in a panel discussion during National Train Day's opening at 9:30 a.m. at the Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Plaza and Central Union Terminal.
The event, running until 4 p.m., will feature more than 40 exhibitors and include an array of children's activities, handcar and motorcar rides, and several freight locomotive displays. Clowns and musicians will perform and food will be available.
"The goal is to increase community awareness of the critical role of passenger and freight rail in our multimodal transportation system," organizers said in a statement announcing the event's lineup.
No passenger-train equipment will be displayed, but tickets for travel on Amtrak will be among the event's raffle prizes.
Among this year's new exhibitors will be the Eastwood Middle School Hobby Club, composed mainly of special-needs students who have built a Lionel train layout to display.
"The club was formed to give these students a chance to learn interaction and socialization doing activities they enjoy," said Bill Gill, an event leader.
The Sofia Quintero Art and Cultural Center, meanwhile, will mark Cinco de Mayo with an arts-and-crafts station.
National Train Day is in its 11th year in Toledo, with typical attendance between 6,000 and 8,000 people. Admission and parking are free, with overflow parking and free shuttle service provided at the Owens Corning lot.

Texto completo: Prosecutors confident that Cosby conviction will stand
NORRISTOWN, Pa. - The prosecutors who put Bill Cosby away say they're confident the conviction at his suburban Philadelphia sexual-assault retrial will stand.
Kristen Feden and Stewart Ryan spoke to The Associated Press on Saturday about the nearly three-year journey from reopening the case to last Thursday's verdict and how they restructured their approach after last year's hung jury.
An accuser's story that Cosby drugged and molested her in 2004 was supported by those of other women who said he violated them, too.
The 80-year-old Cosby is a prisoner in his own home and faces the prospect of spending the rest of his life behind bars as he awaits sentencing. He has maintained his innocence. His publicist has declared his conviction a "public lynching." His lawyers have vowed to appeal.

Democrats strive to tighten hold in several states

Texto completo: INDEPENDENCE, Ore. - Unfazed by signs banning soliciting and dogs that barked at her in almost every home she visited, a political newbie knocked on doors, handed out campaign flyers and asked voters to elect her to the Oregon Senate.
Deb Patterson, who canvassed in the riverside town of Independence on a recent Saturday, hopes to win the May 15 primary and unseat four-term Republican Sen. Jackie Winters in November. A win could propel Democrats into a "supermajority in the Legislature, with the ability to increase state revenue without Republican support.
Democrats buoyed by anti-Trump political activism want to wrest control of legislatures from Republicans, but they're also striving to tighten their hold in states where they have an edge - or where control is split - in order to pass legislation ranging from gun control to health care and from taxation to campaign finance reform.
Republicans also consider these states battlegrounds. In Oregon, a political action committee called No Supermajorities has received a $5,000 contribution from Koch Industries, the Kansas-based energy conglomerate of billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch who advocate for conservative causes.
"If even one Republican loses re-election in November 2018, there is no telling what kind of new taxes Democratic leaders might push through, the PAC's website proclaims.
A supermajority is a level that exceeds the threshold to produce a majority.
In Oregon, Democrats need just one more seat in the Senate and one in the House to reach a three-fifths supermajority in both chambers. That would give them a better shot at increasing corporate taxes in a state where corporations pay one of the lowest rates in the nation.
"We continue to have a pattern where families pay more into the tax system to support state services than do corporations and businesses, said Jeanne Atkins, chair of the Democratic Party of Oregon. "With a supermajority maybe there's a better chance, but of course the devil is always in the details.
Atkins called Patterson "a serious candidate who's among those who might take seats from Republicans.
Patterson is a pastor at a rural church who has worked as a health care advocate and never held elected office. But after Donald Trump was elected president in 2016 and threatened the Affordable Care Act, Patterson was so upset that she decided to enter politics.
"I'm running for office because the last election took me by surprise, and I realized that people had to get active and get involved, Patterson said after spending a morning knocking on doors. "We have to stand up at the state level to push back against the changes that are coming at the federal level.
Heading into the 2018 elections, Republicans control 32 state legislatures, Democrats 13, and four are split between the parties, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Nebraska, unique among U.S. states, is unicameral and officially nonpartisan.
For their part, Republicans hope to snatch seats away from Democrats in November.
"Republicans have proven with the right candidate and right policies they can win in historically adverse areas, said David James of the Republican State Leadership Committee.
In New York, Democrats dominate the state Assembly. On Tuesday, they won two Senate seats in special elections, leaving them one short of controlling that chamber. In theory they have a one-seat advantage, but a Democrat consistently sides with Republicans. If Democrats gain another Senate seat in November, they can more easily push liberal priorities like gun control, advance voting and campaign finance reform.
Sen. Andrea Stewart-Cousins, leader of the Senate Democrats, said of Tuesday's elections: "These electoral wins are part of the blue wave' sweeping our state and nation which will help even more Senate Democratic candidates win in the upcoming general election.
In Colorado, Democrats control the House and are one seat away from flipping the Senate. If they succeed, and hang onto the governorship, health care would be a priority, with single-payer or Medicaid for all at the top of the agenda. They would also try to strengthen gun control legislation and undo several constitutional amendments that severely restrict spending.
The national Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee is also targeting other key chambers like the Maine Senate. Democrats in Maine need only one seat to establish a majority in both chambers - if they maintain control of the House.
"We are harnessing the incredible momentum we've seen from volunteers and activists all over the country and we're mobilizing record numbers of door knockers, volunteers making phone calls, and doing everything we can to elect more Democrats, said Mara Sloan of the campaign committee.
Having a supermajority doesn't always translate into unity, though, as both Democrats and Republicans discovered in Illinois and Kansas.
Illinois Democrats want at least four more House seats to reach the 71 needed to overturn vetoes by the governor. They've had a supermajority in the Senate since 2015. But from 2015-2017, they also had that magic number of 71 in the House, yet had little to show for it because three party members refused to get in lockstep with Democratic House Speaker Michael Madigan.
It wasn't until July 2017, when the Democrats' control slipped to 67 seats, that they managed to break a two-year budget stalemate with Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner by persuading five House Republicans to join them in overriding his veto of an income-tax increase.
Illinois Democrats also diverged on social issues. For instance, some Democratic senators voted against a plan to set up a state licensing system for firearms dealers.
In Kansas, a Republican split emerged last year as the GOP-controlled Legislature sought to roll back income tax cuts enacted by Republican Gov. Sam Brownback in 2012 and 2013. The cuts resulted in the state not having enough money because tax revenues fell and promised economic gains didn't make up the difference. Conservative Republicans blasted the proposed rollback as a tax hike. Still, it passed, Brownback vetoed it, and lawmakers overrode the veto.
In many legislatures, Republicans have used their clout to cut taxes, limit union powers and expand school-choice initiatives.
It's a blueprint that shows Democrats can push their own agenda if they consolidate power in these states.
"I am feeling good about progressives' chances on the ballot this fall, Oregon Gov. Kate Brown said.

Maine Gov. Paul LePage sued for blocking Medicaid expansion

Texto completo: Maine Republican Gov. Paul LePage is being sued for blocking the state's expansion of Medicaid after voters approved a ballot measure to extend the program to low-income residents.

The provision, which was created under Obamacare, would expand the government-funded Medicaid program to anyone making less than roughly $16,800 a year. An estimated 70,000 people in the state are expected to sign up for the program.

Voters in November passed Medicaid expansion through a ballot measure that had the support of 59 percent of voters. Under the law, Maine must submit an application for expansion to the federal government by April 3 and have the program expanded by July 2.

The lawsuit filed Monday is led by Maine Equal Justice Partners, an anti-poverty group that also led the ballot movement in the state.

LePage, who is in his last year in office, opposes Medicaid expansion and said he would not allow the expansion until the legislature finds a way to fund the program without tax hikes and without taking money from the state's surplus funds. He has vetoed Medicaid expansion in the state five times.

State lawmakers have approved $3.8 million in spending to help cover the administrative costs of expansion but the funding is caught up in ongoing negotiations on other matters.

Under the way Obamacare was written, all states were originally intended to expand Medicaid, but a Supreme Court decision made the provision optional. The law specifies that the federal government is to cover 100 percent of the expansion costs beginning in 2014 but that support dwindles to 90 percent by 2020, giving the states responsibility to pick up the rest.

Molina CEO considers returning to some Obamacare markets. Molina Healthcare is leaving open the possibility of returning to two Obamacare marketplaces the company left in 2017 after heavy losses. Chief Executive Officer Joseph Zubretsky told investors today that the insurer may resubmit price proposals for Utah and Wisconsin, but is still developing preliminary bids due in June. Molina withdrew from the two states and sought to cut 1,500 jobs after a net loss of $230 million in the second quarter of 2017. “We have decisions to make in Florida and New Mexico,” he said. “The other states are performing well, so there is no reason to believe we wouldn’t still be successful.” Industry experts have warned that premiums costs across all Obamacare plan levels may continue to jump in 2019. The plans start at bronze, with the lowest premium payments and highest treatment costs, and continue through silver, gold and platinum with progressively higher payments and increased coverage.


Maine governor sued for blocking ​Medicaid expansion. Maine Gov. Paul LePage was sued today for not expanding the Medicaid program in the state, after residents passed it during a ballot measure in November. The lawsuit is being led ​in Superior Court by Maine Equal Justice Partners​, an anti-poverty organization. ​LePage, who vetoed five bills that reached his desk to expand Medicaid to low-income people under Obamacare, has said that he won't pass expansion until the legislature finds a way to pay for the program. The law, passed under the ballot measure, says an expansion plan must head to the federal government by April 3 and that by July 2 the state expansion is supposed to occur. An estimated 70,000 people would be covered under the provision.

White House on Ronny Jackson: ‘No personnel announcements at this time.’ The White House today pushed back on reports that Dr. Ronny Jackson wouldn’t be returning to his role as President Trump’s doctor after he withdrew himself from consideration to be the next Veterans Affairs secretary. The reports said Dr. Sean Conley, the Naval officer who replaced Jackson as President Trump's personal doctor, would continue to treat Trump. “Rear Admiral Ronny Jackson is currently on active duty, assigned to the White House as deputy assistant to the president,” said Raj Shah, White House principal deputy press secretary. “Despite published reports, there are no personnel announcements at this time.” Jackson withdrew his VA secretary nomination after unverified reports were made to the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee concerning his behavior in previous management positions. The complaints included working drunk on the job and over-prescribing pain sleep and medication. Trump and the White House have defended Jackson in the wake of the allegations. On Saturday, Trump called for Sen. Jon Tester, D-Mont., the ranking member on the panel who spoke publicly about the accusations, to resign. "The great people of Montana will not stand for this kind of slander when talking of a great human being. Admiral Jackson is the kind of man that those in Montana would most respect and admire, and now, for no reason whatsoever, his reputation has been shattered. Not fair, Tester!" Trump tweeted. During his speech in Michigan later in the day, Trump said: "I know things about Tester that I could say too. And if I said them he'd never be elected again."


Republicans tarnish Manchin with Mylan layoffs, EpiPen scandal. The Republican National Committee is attacking vulnerable West Virginia Senate Democrat Joe Manchin for accepting donations from drug maker Mylan, which his daughter Heather Bresch heads. The RNC bashed Manchin Thursday after Mylan announced it was laying off 500 people at a plant in West Virginia. Manchin has taken heat before from his opponents over Mylan’s decision a few years ago to jack up the price of allergy drug EpiPen by 500 percent. “Amidst the layoffs and scandals, Mylan has continued to contribute to Manchin's war chest for his upcoming election,” an RNC bulletin said. “Mylan executives and employees contributed more than $50,000 to Manchin's campaign in the first quarter of 2018.” Manchin is considered to be one of the most vulnerable senators up for re-election in November, seeking another term in a state that Trump won by 20 percentage points in the 2016 election.


Democrat introduces bill to allow auto-enrollment in Obamacare. A California Democrat has introduced a proposal for Obamacare that Senate Republicans backed within the context of their repeal and replace efforts last year. The legislation from Rep. Ami Bera would allow states to set up programs that automatically enroll people in Obamacare plans or in Medicaid, depending on which programs they qualify for. People would have 60 days to opt out of the health insurance.


Pro-Obamacare group launches web ads blaming Trump administration for Obamacare prices. The pro-Obamacare group Protect Our Care is launching digital ads today that aim to blame the Trump administration and congressional Republicans for premium prices on Obamacare plans.  “From the moment he took office, President Trump has launched attack after attack on our healthcare, and congressional Republicans have been eager to help,” said the group’s campaign director, Brad Woodhouse.


Top Democrat questions CDC chief salary. Sen. Patty Murray, the top Democrat on the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, sent a letter last week to Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar asking for more information about whether the agency properly used a special hiring mechanism to bring on Dr. Robert Redfield as director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Redfield was hired in March through a provision known as Title 42, which allows government workers to receive higher salaries when they have a particularly valuable area of research they specialize in. Redfield, an expert in HIV/AIDS, makes $375,000 a year, more than his recent predecessors and more than other current officials, including Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar.


Supreme Court agrees to hear case of man on death row with rare medical condition. The U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to hear a case involving a Missouri man on death row with a rare disease who is challenging the state's method of execution. The justices stayed the execution of Russell Bucklew, 49, last month pending the court’s decision to consider the case and said Monday they would hear Bucklew’s appeal. Bucklew was scheduled to die by lethal injection March 20. But his lawyers argue that his rare medical condition would cause him to experience “the excruciating pain of prolonged suffocation” in violation of the Eighth Amendment. Bucklew has a tumor in his throat, caused by cavernous hemangioma, that often blocks his airway. Bucklew likely would struggle to breath during the injection procedure, causing the tumor to rupture, his lawyers say.


Illnesses from eating romaine lettuce rise to 98, CDC says. Federal health officials found another 14 cases of sickness linked to contaminated romaine lettuce from Yuma, Ariz., increasing the total to 98 illnesses in 22 states. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention did not change its advisory for consumers to stay away from romaine lettuce grown in Yuma because of the outbreak of E. coli. It also has warned that consumers should not eat romaine if they cannot identify where it came from.


Alfie Evans mourned by Pope Francis. Prominent international figures mourned the death of Alfie Evans on Saturday after the 23-month-old British boy was taken off life support. Evans, who had a terminal illness because of a degenerative brain condition, was taken off life support five days before he died after multiple courts in Britain ruled that keeping him alive was not in his best interest. His parents had drawn the support of Pope Francis and waged a legal battle to take their son to the Vatican children's hospital for treatment, but doctors in Rome concluded that Evans couldn't be treated. “I am deeply moved by the death of little Alfie,” Francis tweeted. “Today I pray especially for his parents, as God the Father receives him in his tender embrace.”


FDA chief: Calorie labeling rule could help Americans shed up to five pounds a year. The head of the Food and Drug Administration said a requirement for restaurant chains to post calorie counts would reduce their caloric intake by 30 to 50 calories. “That turns out to be about 3-5 pounds a year that you can lose by having better information,” Gottlieb said in an interview on Fox News on Sunday. He added that the menu labeling requirement is “pro competition” because restaurants “are gonna probably reformulate their foods to make them more healthful. Some consumers are still gonna opt for the high calorie optio but they will know what they are getting.” The menu-labeling rule requires any restaurant with 20 or more locations to post calorie information on food items. The agency extended the compliance date for menu labeling requirements from May 5, 2017, to May 7, 2018.

Texto completo: An Idaho grassroots group says it has gathered enough signatures for a November ballot initiative on whether to expand Medicaid.

The group Reclaim Idaho plans to submit on Monday more than 60,000 signatures to get expansion on the ballot, according to a report in the Idaho Statesman.

The group needs 56,192 valid signatures, which has to include 6 percent of registered voters from at least 18 legislative districts to be considered, the report said. The state must validate that the signatures are authentic.

If the referendum passes in November, Idaho would become the 21 st state to expand Medicaid under Obamacare. The group says 78,000 Idahoans could get coverage through the expansion.

Rep. Raul Labrador, R-Idaho, who is running for governor, said in a recent debate he would work to overturn the initiative if voters passed it in November, according to the Associated Press.

Maine voters in 2017 decided to expand Medicaid through a ballot initiative. However, Republican Gov. Paul LePage, who vetoed several bills to expand Medicaid, has blocked the expansion. Now the anti-poverty organization Maine Equal Justice Partners is suing LePage over his obstruction.

Texto completo: The most bipartisan lawmakers in the Senate last year were mostly Republicans, while Democrats were ranked least likely to see eye-to-eye with those across the aisle, according to a study released Monday.

Sen. Susan Collins of Maine was ranked the most bipartisan senator, and she was followed by two other Republicans, Rob Portman of Ohio and Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, according to the Lugar Center and Georgetown University's McCourt School of Public Policy biannual study.

Sens. Joe Donnelly of Indiana was the only Democrat among the top 10 members.

The other Republicans rounding out the top 10 were Sens. Dean Heller of Nevada, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Chuck Grassley of Iowa, Cory Gardner of Colorado, Todd Young of Indiana, and Marco Rubio of Florida.

At the bottom of the list, eight of the 10 least bipartisan legislators were Democrats. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent who caucuses with the Democratic Party, was deemed the least bipartisan person in the upper chamber.

Sanders was followed by Sens. Chris Murphy, D-Conn.; Richard Shelby, R-Ala.; Patty Murray, D-Wash.; Luther Strange, R-Ala.; Al Franken, D-Minn.; Ed Markey, D-Mass.; Dick Durbin, D-Ill.; Chris Van Hollen, D-Md.; and Jeff Merkley, D-Ore.

Texto completo: A 46-year-old Scarborough woman pleaded guilty Monday to embezzling nearly $550,000 from a medical practices where she worked.
Carrie Caporino pleaded guilty in U.S. District Court to two counts of embezzlement from health care providers and one count of Social Security number fraud, according to a release from U.S. Attorney Halsey B. Frank.
Prosecutors said that between 2014 and 2016, Caporino made personal charges on office credit cards, used office funds to pay a personal credit card and her PayPal account, and wrote office checks to pay for personal expenses including her rent.
In 2016 and 2017, Caporino embezzled approximately $253,000 from a Falmouth physician by mobile depositing checks made payable to her employer from patients and insurance companies into her personal bank accounts and by writing checks to herself that had not been authorized by her employer, according to the release.
She also used a Social Security number not assigned to her on an application for health insurance while she worked for the dental practice.
In July 2017, Caporino was one of more than 400 people arrested across the country as part of a nationwide crackdown on health care fraud, The Boston Globe reported.
The Department of Justice said at the time that 412 people, including 56 doctors nationwide, were arrested as part of what Attorney General Jeff Sessions called "the largest health care fraud takedown operation in American history."
Caporino faces up to 10 years in prison for the embezzlement counts and up to five years for the Social Security charge. The maximum fine for each count is $250,000.
She will be sentenced after completion of a presentence report by the U.S. Probation Office.

Texto completo: The Orono Bog Boardwalk, one of most popular nature walks in the Bangor area, will open for its 16th season at 7 a.m. on Tuesday, May 1, with several improvements.
Return visitors will notice that a large portion of the boardwalk has been rebuilt since last season. After the boardwalk closed in mid October, a group of nearly 40 volunteers worked for hundreds of hours to install 96 new sections of the boardwalk, three wheelchair turnouts and two interpretive stations.
The new sections are a part of an ongoing $1 million restoration project. Over the past five years, boardwalk volunteers have worked together to replace 396 of 509 sections of the original wooden boardwalk, which has begun to rot in recent years. The new sections are made of more durable composite decking with cladded aluminum siding and stainless steel posts featuring floats that keep the sections level in the water-filled bog.
To date, 113 sections are left to be purchased and installed. Fundraising is in progress for that phase of construction, which should cost about $139,000. The goal is to complete the reconstruction by the end of 2018.
"Once everything gets done, we'll be able to refocus efforts on education, trying to get out to various service groups and schools and advertising more tours," said Jim Bird, director of the Orono Bog Boardwalk Committee.
Measuring about a mile long, the wheelchair-accessible boardwalk winds through a forested
wetland to emerge into an open peat bog, filled with interesting plants including gnarled black spruce, fluffy-tipped cotton sedge, carnivorous pitcher plants and a wide variety of flowers, including sheep laurel, rhodora, blue flag iris and rose pogonia. Interpretive panels with color photos, diagrams and illustrations help visitors learn more about the various habitats the boardwalk travels through, and there are benches along the way so people can rest and enjoy the surroundings.
Located on the eastern edge of the Rolland F. Perry City Forest -- commonly known as the Bangor City Forest -- the boardwalk is jointly managed by the University of Maine, the City of Bangor and the Orono Land Trust. Since it opened in June 2003, it has been visited by more than 350,000 people.
The boardwalk can be accessed from the forest's parking lot at the end of Tripp Drive off Stillwater Avenue in Bangor. Throughout the spring and summer, the boardwalk is open daily from 7 a.m. to 6:30 p.m., with hours adjusting for day-length changes in autumn. Admission is free. Dogs are not permitted.
For more information, visit umaine.edu/oronobogboardwalk or the Orono Bog Boardwalk Facebook page. Coming up, there will be guided bird walks on the boardwalk on Saturday, May 12, and Saturday, May 19, as well as the boardwalk's major annual fundraiser, a yard dale, running from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. Saturday, June 16, at 139 Main Street in Orono. If interested in any of the events, email Jim Bird at james.bird@maine.edu or call 207-866-2578.
Donations for the reconstruction of the boardwalk can be made online at our.umaine.edu/OronoBogBoardwalk or by mail to the University of Maine Foundation, 2 Alumni Place, Orono, ME 04469-5792.

Texto completo: Maple Leafs' Lamoriello will not return as GM next season
TORONTO -- Toronto Maple Leafs general manager Lou Lamoriello will not return to the role next season.
Team President Brendan Shanahan said Monday he was sticking to a plan that called for the 75-year-old Lamoriello to serve as GM for three years and then transition to senior adviser for four years.
Shanahan said he doesn't have a timeline for filling the GM position.
The Maple Leafs set franchise records for points (105) and wins (49) in the regular season, but were eliminated in seven games by the Boston Bruins in the first round of the playoffs last week. Coach Mike Babcock, Shanahan and the rest of the team expected more this year after getting back to the postseason a year ago.
Auston Matthews found his scoring touch amid injury woes and goalie Frederik Andersen set a franchise record for wins in a season with 38. Among the issues for the new GM: Veteran forwards James van Riemsdyk, Tyler Bozak and Leo Komarov are among the players set to hit unrestricted free agency, and Matthews, Mitch Marner and William Nylander are due big raises in the not-too-distant future.No hearing for Wilson for hit on Dumoulin
WASHINGTON -- A person with direct knowledge of the decision says there will not be a disciplinary hearing for Washington Capitals winger Tom Wilson for his hit to the head of Pittsburgh Penguins defenseman Brian Dumoulin.
The person spoke to The Associated Press on Monday on condition of anonymity because the NHL does not announce when there is no hearing for a player.
Wilson struck Dumoulin, a Biddeford, Maine, native, in the head with his left shoulder 4:36 into the second period of Game 2 Sunday. No penalty was called. Dumoulin adjusted his positioning at the last second to brace for a hit from Alex Ovechkin, which was enough to keep Wilson from being suspended. Wilson will be available for Game 3 Tuesday at Pittsburgh.
Wilson said after the game he watched replays and didn't know what he could have done to avoid hitting Dumoulin's head. Dumoulin remained down on the ice for several minutes, went down the tunnel and never returned.
Penguins captain Sidney Crosby and teammates expected the league to take a look at Wilson's hit on Dumoulin in part because of the Capitals winger's track record. Wilson was suspended twice this season stemming from incidents in exhibition games.Ex NFL player, GM Matt Millen has rare ailment, heart woes
ALLENTOWN, Pa. -- Former NFL player and general manager Matt Millen says he is being treated for a rare disease that has robbed his heart of most of its normal function.
The 60-year-old Millen told the Morning Call in Allentown, Pennsylvania, that he has been diagnosed with amyloidosis, a life-threatening illness that may force him to seek a heart transplant. Millen said he has been receiving chemotherapy once a week to treat the condition that left his heart functioning at just 30 percent.
Millen played 12 seasons as a linebacker in the NFL for the Raiders, 49ers and Redskins -- and won four Super Bowl rings.
He later served as Detroit's general manager and has also spent three decades as a broadcaster. Millen told the Morning Call he plans to return to the booth in the fall.
Millen's heart issues began in 2011, when he first felt chest pain while exercising. Heart tests, including a cardiac catheterization, showed nothing wrong.
Amyloidosis often goes undiagnosed because its symptoms mimic those of more common diseases. But Millen's symptoms grew worse over time, and he visited doctors for six years before finally getting diagnosed with the rare disease last July.
"I know what you have," Millen recalled the doctor telling him, "and you're not going to like it."
Millen's case reached the point where he was risking the kind of heart failure that would eventually require a transplant. Millen spent the week before the Super Bowl undergoing tests at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota.
"When a bump comes up in the road, you deal with it," Millen said. "It's ridiculous to feel sorry for yourself. I'm thankful for what I have, and I'll take what I get."University of Minnesota settles harassment claims for $300K
MINNEAPOLIS -- The University of Minnesota paid nearly $300,000 to settle sexual harassment complaints related to former athletic director Norwood Teague, newly released documents show.
Teague resigned in 2015 after two high-ranking administrators said he sexually harassed them at a senior leadership retreat at Breezy Point Resort in Pequot Lakes. He apologized for what he said was his "offensive behavior." Teague said he'd had too much to drink at the retreat and that his behavior doesn't illustrate his true character.
Ann Aronson, former deputy chief of staff in University President Eric Kaler's office, and Erin Dady, special assistant to the president, said they reported Teague's actions because they were frightened and feared others would be subject to such behavior.
"Sexual harassment is a predatory act. Having too much to drink does not excuse it," they said in a joint statement in 2015. "It's a problem that continues to plague our institutions and our working lives despite programs and training designed to suppress it. The only way to eliminate it is to call attention to it when you see it or experience it."
The women signed separate agreements in 2016 and received settlements totaling nearly $300,000 in exchange for waiving any legal claims they might file against the university.
Terms of the settlements hadn't been disclosed until the Star Tribune and the Wall Street Journal requested the information.
University officials are continuing to promote "a culture that prevents sexual misconduct and aggressively addresses it when it occurs," said Evan Lapiska, a university spokesman. Settlements "acknowledge wrongs and attempt to heal wounds," he said.
The university previously paid former associate athletic director Regina Sullivan $175,000 in 2013 to settle a gender discrimination complaint against Teague.
Teague's previous employer, Virginia Commonwealth University, paid a former women's basketball coach $125,000 to settle another gender discrimination complaint.

Texto completo: BANGOR, Maine -- While the American Legion baseball ranks are decreasing statewide, the Queen City will be the sport's capital in late July as it plays host to back-to-back state tournaments.
According to Zone 1 commissioner Dave Paul, the Senior Legion state tournament will be held at the Winkin Complex on the campus of Husson University in Bangor from July 28 to Aug. 1. However, with the reduction of teams statewide from 27 in 2017 to as few as 20 this summer, the number of teams and the format for the 2018 state tournament have not yet been made final.
The Bangor Comrades are the defending Senior Legion state champion and have won the state title in three of the last four years.
The Senior Legion state tournament will follow the Junior Legion state tournament, which is scheduled for July 26-28 at Mansfield Stadium in Bangor.
Paul said teams expected to compete statewide at the Junior Legion level this year number in the low- to mid-20s, with 11 of those teams expected to represent the Zone 1 region that also encompasses all of the Senior Legion programs in northern and eastern Maine.
There will be three Senior Legion regions, or zones, as they traditionally have been called, this summer while Junior Legion will have North and South divisions.

Texto completo: Stonewall Kitchen is voluntarily recalling 732 jars of its Basil Pesto Aioli due to a labeling mix-up that omitted egg, which can be an allergen, from the list of ingredients.
The York-based speciality food purveyor began shipping the product on Monday, April 23, with labels for Basil Pesto mistakenly placed on the jars of Basil Pesto Aioli. It has not experienced any problems or complaints from consumers, according to a press release issued Monday afternoon.
"If consumers have any of the above product, they must discontinue use and discard product immediately," the company said in the statement. "Basil Pesto Aioli contains the dairy allergen egg, whereas Basil Pesto does not. People who have an allergy or severe sensitivity to egg run the risk of serious or life-threatening allergic reaction if they consume these products."
The 10.25 ounce jars have a use-by date of Sept. 28, 2019 and were shipped to 38 different wholesale retailers, which all have been notified of the labeling mistake.
Consumers are asked to contact Stonewall Kitchen Premier Guest Services by email at guestservices@stonewallkitchen.com or by phone at 800-826-1735 for refund instructions and further information.

Texto completo: No longer simply the preferred meal for holidays like Mother's Day and Easter, or for bridal and baby showers, brunch is now a definitive part of American culture.
There's a whole line of merchandise emblazoned with phrases like "Brunch Squad" and "Hakuna Mimosa." The meal's popularity even spawned a backlash in the form of critical think pieces -- which seems like a lot of fuss about bacon, French toast and champagne.
Just five years ago in the Bangor area, there was only a small handful of brunch options. In 2018, you can take your pick from multiple places that offer the luxurious mid-day meal.
We've rounded up eight places to get brunch in the Bangor area. For our purposes, we are differentiating between breakfast (something that's served every day and starts earlier in the morning) and brunch (generally a weekend-only affair that starts later in the morning).
Blaze
18 Broad St., Bangor; 922-2660
Blaze recently hired Leslie Wilson, the former chef at the now-closed Bacon Tree in Winterport, to head up its brunch offerings. Blaze does well with scrambles, eggs benedicts and breakfast pizza, but expect some of Wilson's favorite dishes, like the reuben omelette and buttermilk fried chicken and waffles. Brunch is served from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Sundays.
Evenrood's
25 Broad St. Bangor; 517-2456
Weekend brunch at Evenrood's in downtown Bangor has a fun selection of both breakfast-y and brunch-y items, including several types of eggs benedict and build-your-own omelette options, as well as a bunch of fancy-schmancy breakfast sandwiches. Prime rib, cheddar and horseradish, served with two eggs on an English muffin? Sounds good to us.
Mason's Brewing Co.
15 Hardy St., Brewer; 989-6300
The view from Mason's huge deck overlooking the Penobscot River is as tasty as the menu, though the menu's pretty tasty, too. Mason's offers brunch every Sunday, including such weekly treats as an array of egg benedict served multiple ways, and a build-your-own Bloody Mary bar. On the first Sunday of the month, there's a live DJ spinning classic vinyl.
Miguel's Mexican Cantina
697 Hogan Road, Bangor; 942-3002
If you're more of a tequila person when it comes to your day booze, you're in luck: Miguel's offers a Sunday brunch complete with huevos rancheros, chilaquiles and, yes, tequila. Other specialties include horchata and blueberry pancakes and breakfast tacos and burritos.
Timber Kitchen & Bar
22 Bass Park Blvd, Bangor; 433-0844
The brunch offerings at Timber take things to the next level. A Sunday-only treat, Timber has a multi-course brunch for $25 per person ($15 for kids 12 and under), designed for large tables of brunchers. It includes a starter and a main for each diner, plus popovers, sides and roasted meats to share for the table. Brunch is served from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Sundays, and reservations are recommended.
Stone Sparrow Cafe
1492 State St., Veazie; 942-9552
The cozy little cafe in between Bangor and Orono only seats a few dozen, but if you're lucky enough to get a table during their weekend brunch service -- served 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. Sundays -- Stone Sparrow makes some of the best eggs benedict in Maine. There are always some surprises available during brunch that make it a different sort of meal from its regular weekday breakfast. Call ahead to make sure you can get a seat.
The Family Dog
6 Mill St., Orono; 866-2808
On Saturdays and Sundays from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m., The Family Dog -- which already serves breakfast during the week -- expands its offering to include more brunchy items, like house-made beef hash, bananas foster French toast, and a Bloody Mary bar. It can be lively and crowded, with regular live music as well.
The Lucerne Inn
2517 Main Road., Dedham; 843-5123
Long before there were T-shirts that read "Brunch Hard" or "You had me at mimosas," the Lucerne Inn in Dedham was doing a brunch buffet. Not much has changed over the years at this Route 1A stalwart: waffles, omelettes, eggs benedict, carving stations, fresh bread and baked goods, smoked salmon and all the usual good stuff. On Mother's Day, the inn accommodates hundreds of people eager to brunch with mom. $31.95 for adults; $14.95 for 12 and under.

Texto completo: AUGUSTA, Maine -- Republican U.S. Senate hopeful Max Linn on Monday asked Maine's high court to put him back on the June primary ballot after a lower-court judge's decision to uphold the state's decision to boot him from it over fraud on his nominating petitions.
Linn of Bar Harbor was initially certified for the June ballot in March, but his petitions were challenged by the campaign of state Sen. Eric Brakey of Auburn -- the only other Republican running for the nomination to run against independent U.S. Sen. Angus King in November.
After challenges from Brakey's campaign, a Maine judge on Thursday upheld Secretary of State Matt Dunlap's ruling that Linn should be removed from the ballot after invalidating a total of 258 signatures for many problems, including several purported signatures from dead people.
Linn's lawyer, Steven Juskewitch, filed a notice of appeal to the Maine Supreme Judicial Court in an Augusta courthouse on Monday. A Linn spokesman didn't respond to a request for comment. David Boyer, Brakey's political director, said he hopes the high court "respects the Superior Court's decision."
Linn has admitted that fraud existed on his petitions, though he has said that he doesn't know who among his campaign was responsible. He has blamed Brakey for sabotaging his campaign's signatures without providing any evidence to back the claim.

Texto completo: NORRIDGEWOCK, Maine -- The man accused of killing a Somerset County sheriff's deputy on Wednesday admitted to shooting him before fleeing into the woods, a friend of the suspect said.
After John D. Williams, 29, allegedly shot Cpl. Eugene Cole -- sometime after 1 a.m. -- he called Christopher "Chris" Williams, 38, from inside the slain deputy's stolen cruiser and told him, "Eugene Cole snuck up behind me and I turned around and shot him," Chris told the Bangor Daily News on Friday. Elements of his story were contained in a court document released Monday.
The men share a last name but are not related. During an interview on Friday, Chris told the BDN they were introduced in the fall by John's fiancee and Chris' longtime friend, Kristina Pomerleau.
[Suspect in deputy's slaying to undergo psych evaluation]
Leading up to the killing, John was high on a "six-day crack bender" and increasingly "bent out of shape" about his upcoming court date in Massachusetts for a pending gun charge, said Chris, a Skowhegan carpenter.
John was also frantically trying to come up with $5,000 to bail his fiancee out of county jail, after she was arrested over the previous weekend on drug charges, he said. Cole was one of the deputies who arrested her at a traffic stop, Chris said.
Chris said he and John spent all day on Tuesday, April 24, hanging out.
They parted ways when Chris dropped John off at a Skowhegan apartment complex, Indian Ridge, around 1 a.m., he said. John got into a blue car and drove off, and Chris headed home to sleep, he said.
Less than a half hour later, at 1:15 a.m., Chris said John called him and told him he'd shot Cole, but didn't say why or where. An arrest affidavit released Monday revealed Chris told police John said he shot Cole in the head, although the document states Cole died of a gunshot wound of the neck that perforated his spinal cord.
When later interviewed by police, Chris told an investigator that he couldn't recall if John told him that he snuck up on Cole, or Cole snuck up on him, according to the affidavit.
[What we know about the shooting death of Cpl. Eugene Cole and the manhunt for John D. Williams]
In the early hours of Wednesday morning, after John's alleged confession and at John's request, Chris said he drove in a state of disbelief to meet John at Martin Stream Road -- before it turns from pavement to gravel -- where John had ditched Cole's stolen marked police cruiser.
Prior to that -- but after he shot Cole -- John drove the stolen cruiser to the Cumberland Farms convenience store on Route 2, and stole a pack of cigarettes, according to the affidavit. The butt end of a gun was tucked in his waistband, the clerk observed, the document said.
When Chris arrived at Martin Stream Road, John jumped out of the woods, got in Chris' black Mustang, and ordered him to hand over the car, Chris said. He was armed with a 9mm handgun and had a rifle in his lap, and immediately dug around for his crack pipe and started smoking it, he said.
When Chris refused to give John his car, John turned the 9mm on him and repeated the order, he said.
"I'm like, 'John, stop. You need to stop right now,'" Chris told him. "He said, 'what do you want me to do, turn myself in?'"
He told John to get rid of his guns, but John wouldn't, Chris said. About five minutes went by as the two argued, he said.
[ Suspected killer secured with slain deputy's handcuffs]
Chris eventually started to drive back toward Norridgewock, he said. After traveling less than a mile, John got out of the car, stole Chris' phone, and with his guns in hand, ran toward the railroad tracks and into the woods, Chris said.
Cole's body was found around 7:15 a.m. on Wednesday at 16 Mercer Road -- the house where John formerly lived under the care of a woman who helped raised him. That woman, Kimberley Sirois, told the Bangor Daily News on Thursday that police also found a rifle and body armor stashed in her car that morning.
The slaying marked the first time a Maine law enforcement officer was killed in the line of duty in nearly 30 years, and launched a 4-day multi-agency manhunt that culminated in John's Saturday capture in the Norridgewock woods, only a few miles from where Chris said he last saw him.
[Slain officer remembered as gentleman and skilled negotiator]
After John fled the car -- sometime after 2 a.m. -- Chris drove on and found a Fairfield police officer parked on Martin Stream Road.
"I stopped him and told him he was just down the road. I told him about the guns that he had -- that it wasn't just a handgun," Chris said he told the cop. At that point, Chris believed police were looking for Cole, he said.
Within a half hour, "there must've been 20 cops showing up," said Chris, who stayed with them for about 45 minutes until he was escorted to the Norridgewock fire station to be interviewed.
He returned home around 6 a.m., but was called back to Martin Stream Road by police after Cole's body was found and police told Chris he was the "last witness to see a homicide suspect," he said.
On Friday, eating two Boston Creme doughnuts at a Skowhegan Dunkin' Donuts, Chris puzzled over what "snapped" in John in the hour after he dropped him off on Tuesday.
"John was a good guy," Chris said, saying he had become fond of him in the months since John started dating his friend. "I think he finally snapped. He couldn't see past the next obstacle in front of him.
On Tuesday -- as he scrambled to come up with his fiancee's bail -- John reportedly told Chris he might "rob every drug dealer I know."
"I could see him going out robbing stores to get money, but to kill the cop? I didn't think he'd do that," Chris said.
Confiding in Chris after he allegedly pulled the trigger, John sounded shocked, too.
"'I'm dead,'" Chris said John told him before fleeing into the woods. "'My life's over.'"

Texto completo: CARIBOU, Maine -- The Aroostook Mental Health Center will mark May as Mental Health Month with an initiative highlighting the importance of physical health on overall mental fitness.
"When you or someone you love is dealing with a mental health concern, sometimes it's a lot to handle. It's important to remember that mental health is essential to everyone's overall health and well-being, and mental illnesses are common and treatable," said Greg Disy, LCSW and CEO of AMHC.
"So much of what we do physically impacts us mentally," Disy said. "That is why this year's theme for May's Mental Health Month, 'Fitness #4Mind4Body,' is a call to pay attention to both your physical health and your mental health, which can help achieve overall wellness and set you on a path to recovery."
Mental Health America (MHA) started "May is Mental Health Month" 69 years ago to raise awareness about mental health conditions and the importance of good mental health for everyone. This May, AMHC will focus on working with clients and its staff to emphasize how a healthy lifestyle may help prevent the onset or worsening of mental health conditions, as well as heart disease, diabetes, obesity and other chronic health problems.
Healthful living can also help people recover from these conditions. Eating healthy foods, managing stress, exercising, and getting enough sleep can go a long way in making you both physically and mentally healthy.
"It is important to really look at your overall health, both physically and mentally, to achieve wellness," said Disy. "Getting the appropriate amount of exercise, eating healthy foods that can impact your gut health, getting enough sleep and reducing stress -- it's all about finding the right balance to benefit both the mind and body."
MHA has developed a series of fact sheets (available at www.mentalhealthamerica.net/may) on the importance of exercise, diet and nutrition, gut health, sleep and stress management.
"Also new this year is the #4Mind4Body Challenge, where we call on everyone to join us in completing a small task each day during the month of May -- and tell us about it on social media using #4Mind4Body," Disy said.
"We know that living a healthy lifestyle is not always easy, but it can be achieved by gradually making small changes and building on those successes," he said. "By looking at your overall health every day -- both physically and mentally -- you can go a long way in ensuring that you focus on your Fitness #4Mind4Body."
For more information on May is Mental Health Month, visit Mental Health America's website at www.mentalhealthamerica.net/may.
AMHC is a non-profit provider of mental health, substance abuse, brain injury, and social services in Aroostook, Hancock and Washington Counties.

Texto completo: BREWER -- The Brewer High School Witches got only one hit in their match-up against defending two-time Class B state champ Old Town on Monday and it didn't factor in a run being scored.
But the Witches, in their first year in Class B after dropping down from Class A, took advantage of three costly Coyote errors, received a four-hit gem from junior right-hander Libby Hewes and played errorless ball behind her to triumph 3-0 at Coffin Field.
Hard-throwing Old Town senior righty McKenna Smith had a no-hitter until Kenzie Dore hooked a sharp line-drive double to left with one out in the sixth inning. And she struck out 14, including three on nine pitches in one stretch.
But her defense let her down and the Coyotes couldn't capitalize on a bases-loaded, one-out situation in the third inning.
Brewer improved to 6-0 while Old Town fell to 3-1.
"We knew we had to bring our A game," said sophomore shortstop Dore. "They're obviously really good. We had to focus and play our butts off.
"We took advantage of those errors and and our defense was really good today," added Dore.
"This was our third game without any errors," pointed out Brewer coach Skip Estes. "Our defense was phenomenal. McKenna is such a good pitcher, we had to capitalize every time we got runners on. We capitalized on their mistakes."
The opportunistic Witches scored a run in the first and two in the third.
Jordan Goodrich opened the first by reaching on a two-base throwing error by the shortstop, she moved to third on a wild pitch and scored on Dore's grounder to short.
"I knew I had to do my job and bring her in," said Dore.
In the third, Smith issued her only walk of the game to Jayden Keefe leading off the inning and Keefe moved to third with nobody out on a pair of passed balls.
One out later, Goodrich grounded to third and Keefe scored when the third baseman overthrew first. Goodrich scored one out later when the left fielder dropped Dore's fly ball.
"We should still be playing. They were able to manufacture three unearned runs," said Old Town coach Jenn Plourde. "That's the game right there. We had our opportunities but we just couldn't get the runs in."
Old Town had a runner on second with nobody out in the second inning when Mikaela Kenny walked and stole second.
But Hewes induced a grounder to third and struck out the next two hitters.
In the third, a walk to Olivia Westura, Morgan Love's bunt single and Smith's infield single loaded the bases with one out.
But Dore made a nice play on Olivia Albert's grounder, throwing to the plate for the forceout, and then third baseman M.J. Sellars made an equally impressive play on Kenny's hot-shot grounder, snaring it and stepping on the bag for the final out.
Hewes allowed only one baserunner the rest of the way. Three of the four hits off her were infield hits.
"It was just a really good day on the mound and I had great defense behind me," said Hewes. "I had a lot of confidence. It's pretty easy to pitch with them behind me."
Hewes struck out 10 and walked two while throwing 54 strikes among her 77 pitches.
"She had pretty good movement on her ball and we definitely struggled with her curve," said Old Town junior shortstop Albert.
Smith threw 62 strikes among her 81 pitches and had just the one walk to go with her 14 strikeouts.
"I would have rather had no strikeouts and a win. They didn't make any errors and we had some. Props to them for getting it done," said Smith.
"McKenna's a great pitcher. She's the best pitcher we've seen so far, absolutely," said Hewes.
Morgan Love and Westura had the other singles for Old Town.

Texto completo: BELFAST, Maine -- A Jackson man will spend the next 18 years in prison for raping a young female relative repeatedly over a two-year span.
Paul Andrews, 34, pleaded guilty to four of 14 counts of gross sexual assault that police had filed against him. He was arrested in late December 2016.
Assistant Attorney General Bill Entwistle said that Andrews "preyed upon" the girl "innumerable times" starting when she was 5 years old and continuing for two years until his arrest.
Andrews faces additional misdemeanor charges for allegedly attacking another inmate at Two Bridges Regional Jail in Wiscasset in early March. Jail officials said Andrews "blindsided" Julio Carrillo, who is accused in the beating death of 10-year-old Marissa Kennedy, his stepdaughter. Those Class D charges, assault and criminal threatening, haven't yet been addressed in court.
Waldo County Superior Court Justice Robert Murray sentenced Andrews on Monday in a Belfast courtroom. Prosecutors had asked for a 28-year sentence, while Andrews' defense attorney requested 10-15.
Entwistle said the age of the victim and the fact that Andrews assaulted her "every other day" for two years warranted a lengthy sentence. Andrews was also allegedly abusing alcohol during much of the time he committed the assaults, and allegedly threatened to hurt the girl further if she told anyone about the abuse.
Andrews' defense attorney argued that several mitigating factors should be taken into consideration. One was Andrews' decision to plead guilty, preventing a trial that could have forced the young girl to testify. Another was Andrews' history as a victim of childhood sexual abuse.
During sentencing, Diane Tennies, a forensic psychologist who evaluated Andrews, testified that Andrews had described a second "persona" named Saul, who was "domineering, mean and self-gratifying." Andrews said he was able to control "Saul," but heavy alcohol use made it more difficult.
"I accept the responsibility that I've done things I wasn't supposed to do," Andrews told the judge
After completing his sentence, Andrews will spend 25 years under supervised release and court monitoring. He'll be included on Maine's sex offender registry for the rest of his life, and can't have contact with anyone younger than 12 or immediate family members.
To reach a sexual assault advocate, call the Statewide Sexual Assault Crisis and Support Line at 800-871-7741, TTY 888-458-5599. This free and confidential 24-hour service is accessible from anywhere in Maine. Calls are automatically routed to the closest sexual violence support service provider.

Texto completo: Editor's note: Beginning Tuesday, May 1, the Bangor Daily News is distributing Amjambo Africa! in the City of Bangor. Look for the free publication inside the BDN the first Tuesday of every month and on Bangor newsstands around the middle of each month.
Amjambo Africa! is Maine's new monthly newspaper for and about new Mainers from Sub-Saharan Africa. The newspaper is an initiative of Ladder to the Moon Network, a nonprofit organization based in Portland. Amjambo Africa! is published in English, French, Kinyarwanda, and Swahili. The paper is free, with ad revenue and small grants providing funding. The publisher of Amjambo Africa! is Georges Budagu Makoko, and the managing editor is Kathreen Harrison, both of whom are board members of Ladder to the Moon Network. Harrison is from the United States and Budagu is from Democratic Republic of Congo.
Warner Graphics of Camden handles design. A team of three New Mainers -- Nathalie Gorey, Jean-Claude Niyibizi, and Pastor Maurice Namwira -- handles translation.
The publication was the brainchild of Harrison and Budagu, who met at an event sponsored by Camden Conference one year ago. In conversation after the event they found they shared the belief that both the newcomer and local populations in Maine could benefit from more information about each other. Harrison speaks English and French and Budagu speaks English, French, Kinyarwanda, Swahili, Kirundi, Kinyamulenge, Lingala and a little Kifurero. They worked for a year to get the paper off the ground. April 1 marked the publication of the first issue of 10,000 copies. Publication has increased to 12,500 copies with the second issue. Distribution extends from South Portland to Bangor. The newspaper is available by subscription by writing to amjamboafrica@gmail.com. Amjambo Africa! is also available for download http://www.laddertothemoonnetwork.org/newspaper.html
The paper includes cultural information, profiles of individuals and organizations, listings of resources, coverage of events of interest to both local and newcomer populations, news from Africa, fun facts, and information about why people have moved to Maine. Amjambo Africa! welcomes letters to the editor, notices of relevant local events, photographs, and suggestions for future stories. Contributions are published at the discretion of the editor and as space allows. Rate sheets for advertising are available by request.

Maine Lobster Festival opts for politics-free parade

Texto completo: Maine's annual lobster festival is leaving politics at the door this year, barring political parties and politicians from marching in the parade for the first time in its 70-year history.
Festival organizers approved the new policy during a meeting last week, and the parade participation application already reflects the rule change.
"The Maine Lobster Festival Parade is a non-partisan, secular and neutral private event which celebrates our community, our people and our lobsters," the application states. "Because of this, we will no longer be accepting political applications. We anticipate and appreciate your respect of this policy."
Cynthia Powell, president of the festival's board, told the Courier-Gazette that some parade entrants said they didn't want to march before or after various political groups because they didn't want to be associated with those groups.
She argued the rule was fair because all political groups are banned.
A message sent to festival organizers on Monday wasn't immediately returned. Knox County's Republican and Democratic committees also didn't reply to emails Monday.
The parade rules also bar weapons, any use of alcohol or drugs by participants, and require that candy be thrown on the grass and sidewalks, not the road.

Fulford halts bid in Democratic primary to challenge Poliquin

Texto completo: Democrat Jonathan Fulford announced Monday that he has suspended his campaign in Maine's 2nd Congressional District for personal reasons.
"I regret the necessity and will not be taking questions at this time," said Fulford in a news release.
Fulford was one of four Democrats vying for the party's nomination in the June 12 primary for a chance to unseat Republican U.S. Rep. Bruce Poliquin.
If Fulford bows out of the race permanently, Democrats Jared Golden of Lewiston, Lucas St. Clair of Hampden and Craig Olson of Islesboro would be left in the primary. Ballots are already printed, so Fulford's name will appear on the ballot, but voters would be notified of his withdrawal at the polls.
Poliquin is seeking his third term representing the 2nd District.
Fulford of Monroe became better known in Maine political circles through two close but unsuccessful campaigns against Republican Maine Senate President Mike Thibodeau of Winterport in 2014 and 2016. He positioned himself in the 2nd District primary as a progressive, courting Mainers who aligned ideologically with independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who won the state's Democratic presidential caucuses in 2016.

Texto completo: From May 5 through May 11, former NASCAR driver Kyle Petty will lead 225 motorcyclists on a 1,200-mile trek from Maine to North Carolina in the 24th edition of the Kyle Petty Charity Ride Across America.
The ride is a fundraiser for the Victory Junction Gang Camp, a North Carolina camp which serves children with chronic or life-threatening illnesses. The camp was started by the Petty family in 2004 in memory of Petty’s son, Adam, who was killed in a crash during practice at New Hampshire Motor Speedway in 2000.
Over two decades of rides, Petty has become an expert at organizing and leading tours along some of the country’s best motorcycle routes. This year, he admits, will be a bit different and a bit more emotional. Kyle and his wife, Morgan, the tour director, are expecting their first child in June. Kyle had three children with his first wife, Pattie.
“Camp changes your perspective,” he said. “Obviously, Adam’s death is the reason we have camp. At the same time, bringing a new life into the world changes your perspective.
“Look at all the kids who come to camp and all the parents who have benefited from camp. We’re right there with them. All that goes up a notch by having another child. ”
Among the celebrities on this year’s ride are Heisman Trophy winners Herschel Walker and George Rogers, Richard Petty, Harry Gant, Donnie Allison, Hershel McGriff, David Ragan and Ricky Craven.
The tour will include stops at New Hampshire Motor Speedway and Pocono Raceway, a Harley-Davidson factory, the site of the Woodstock Music Festival and the Richard Petty Museum. It will end at the camp in Randleman, N. C.
Hembree: Joey Logano keeps his cool to collect third Talladega win
Appreciation: Iconic NASCAR driver James Hylton dies in highway crash
Logano: Talladega win a shot in the arm for Fords, big boost for Team Penske
The ride has concluded at the camp several times, but this will be the first time since 2010.
“When you see camp and the kids and see how that place affects them, it affects you,” Petty said. “The first time we rolled through the gates on the ride, I looked at riders - big guys I love and respect, and they had a tear running down. That’s an impactful moment. ”

Celtics-76ers rivalry could be just like the good old days

Boston-Philadelphia. Basketball wars.
The Celtics are playing the Philadelphia 76ers in the second round of the NBA playoffs and it is a renewal of hostilities that goes back 60 years. This is the 20th postseason meeting between Boston and Philadelphia. It is as close to Red Sox-Yankees as you are going to get in any Celtic spring.
In one of their more impressive wins of the season, the undermanned Celtics (no Jaylen Brown, no Kyrie Irving, no Gordon Hayward, no Malcolm Butler) thrashed the white-hot Sixers, 117-101, in a 48-minute Game 1 frenzy that honored six decades of playoffs featuring the Colonial rivals.
It's odd that this is only the third time the cities have dueled in the NBA tournament in the last 33 years. Celtic fans of a certain age remember when it seemed like Boston and Philly jousted in the playoffs every spring.
This is the rivalry that gave us Wilt Chamberlain vs. Bill Russell (Russell made a rare appearance at the New Garden for Game 1). This is the rivalry that gave us “Havlicek Stole the Ball" and Sam Jones picking up a photographer's stool to defend himself against a charging Chamberlain. This is the rivalry that gave us Cedric Maxwell going after a fan at the old Spectrum, and Larry Bird wrestling with Julius Erving on the Garden parquet floor. Boston vs. Philadelphia gave us Red Auerbach challenging Moses Malone to a fight, Kevin McHale blocking Andrew Toney's shot, and Celtic fans chanting “Beat LA!" when the Sixers eliminated the Celtics to go to the Finals in 1982.
“Those were good days," McHale recalled before Game 1 (he is here working for TNT). “And I think the rivalry is going to be back for a while now. These two teams we are seeing in this series have a chance to be relevant for the next six or seven seasons and that's hard to do. That's about what our real window was from 1981-88 and I think they might be going back to that."
I asked McHale which Sixer he routinely guarded back in the day when the Celtics met Philadelphia almost annually in the playoffs and he answered, “Whoever the best guy was. You don't think Larry was going to take him, do you?"
Max had pretty much the same response.
“Did you guard Julius when you played these guys?" I asked Max.
“What do you think?" he answered, smiling. “Larry? No way!"
Tommy Heinsohn first played against the Philadelphia Warriors in the playoffs in 1958 and remembers his favorite moment at Convention Hall in the 1960 conference finals.
“That was Wilt's first season [37.6 points, 27 rebounds per game]," said Heinsohn. “We beat them in the final game of the playoffs [119-117] when I made a tip-in of Bill Sharman's shot at the buzzer. Wilt was all lined up to block a shot, but I shut up 11,000 fans all at once. You know how tough that is to do?
“They had famous hecklers. One guy was on me before a game one night and I went over to him and said, in a stage whisper, 'No one is allowed to talk to me like that unless his fly is up.' The guy was so embarrassed, he never came back.
“There was another guy who sat right under the basket and was brutal to us year after year. One night Jack Nichols and Cooz hatched a plan at halftime. While we were warming up for the second half, Nichols stood in front of the fan and called for a ball from Cousy, who was standing at the foul line. Cooz wound up and threw his fastball and Nichols stepped aside and Cooz hit the guy right in the head!"
Good times.
The modern-day Sixers are coached by Brett Brown, a 57-year-old basketball lifer from South Portland, Maine, who played four years of college ball on Commonwealth Avenue at Boston University for Rick Pitino. Brown and his dad are both in the New England Basketball Hall of Fame and the Sixer boss has a true grasp of what this rivalry was and could be again.
“I personally grew up with this rivalry," said the coach. “It was right on my doorstep growing up."
Brown is supposed to have the better team in this series. The “Trust The Process" Sixers, who went 75-253 (average season, 19-63) over the last four seasons, broke out in a good way this year and earned theNo. 3 seed in the Eastern Conference. Philly won 24 of its last 28 games and wiped out the Miami Heat in five games in its first-round series.
The Sixers had not played a game in six days when they took the floor Monday and it showed. Tatum scorched them for 16 of his career-high 28 points in the first half and the Green led, 56-45, at intermission.
Tatum kept the heat on in the second half and became the first Celtic rookie with three straight 20-point playoff games since Bird did it four times in 1980. Meanwhile, the estimable Brown was just another Prunty speedbump for Brad Stevens.
“Defensively, offensively, this isn't who we are," Brown said after the loss. “This was a very poor game from us. To think that this game is a reflection of what we've been doing the last few months would be a mistake."
The Celtics had a lot to do with Philly's woes. And yet Stevens, in Belichickian fashion, said it was not one of Boston's better games.
It looked pretty good to all of us.
Philadelphia's Joel Embiid — a legitimate big man cut in the mold of Wilt the Stilt — led the visitors with 31 points and 13 rebounds.
But the Sixers lost. As Russell, Heinsohn, McHale, Maxwell, and Danny Ainge nodded in approval.
It just like the old days at the New Garden.

Texto completo: As the rain drops fell at Moakley Park in Dorchester Monday afternoon, Excel High baseball coach Justin Curley shepherded a full squad of players around before they took the field for a short live scrimmage.
Curley and his players are still in the introductory stage.
Less than three weeks ago, the three-year assistant at John D. O'Bryant School was officially named head coach of the Knights. He replaced former Northeastern pitcher Isaac Lippert , a first-year teacher/coach at Excel High (South Boston) who has taken a leave of absence from both positions according to City athletic director Avery Esdaile .
In his short tenure, though, Curley has commanded the respect of his players, shifting the program into an unfamiliar direction.
“For me, personally, it's a great help to have a coach who is willing to do a lot for us," said senior Alex Trancoso Dipre , who has emerged as a vocal leader as well as a key cog in the Knights' 3-0 start.
“For the guys, it is better than not having anything at all. I can honestly say that we are going to go far with him and we are going to make him a good coach, and possibly win a championship with him before I leave."
Dipre, along with junior righthander Carlos Vasquez , who already has thrown a perfect game this season, form arguably the best pitching duo in the Boston City League.
But as exhibited in wins over Madison Park (15-0) and Burke (22-0), Excel can also produce at the plate. Dipre belted a pair of homers against Madison Park.
“We are tired being overlooked because we haven't been the best the past couple of years. We pretty much have a chip on our shoulder," said Vasquez.
One player whose impact cannot be understated is Hidalgo Villar , a transfer from Snowden International. Positioned at shortstop during the live scrimmage, Villar has provided an early spark for a program that won just two games last spring. He homered against Burke.
[Hidalgo] is only a sophomore, but when I first saw him I thought he was as senior the way he carries himself," said Curley, who teaches at the Community Academy of Health and Science (CASH) in Dorchester.
“Not only is he a great ball player, he is a good leader and he is a huge part of this team. No way we would be 3-0 without him."
Curley acknowledges that not having a connection to his players during the school day is a disadvantage. But he credits the leadership of Dipre, Vasquez and Villar, along with assistant coach Genesiz Gudiel , in making the transition easier.
“We have just been giving 110 percent on and off the field," said Villar. “Never give up even if we are down, we just got to keep going."
Previously, the Knights have struggled with keeping players committed to the program. But as the rain continued to fall on Monday afternoon, and the temperature dropping, the players were all smiles, eagerly waiting to get on the field.
“It makes me feel like a million bucks," said Dipre as he looked out to teammates on the field.
“It makes this program feel like it is doing something for the kids. Even though I am [graduating], if they have this passion and they keep going with it, even the years after I leave, they will still have this fire under them."
Curley said the turnout, and interest “says a lot about them not only as baseball players, but more as people.
“Just their work ethic [and] their character. Alex is a senior so he knows they were kind of the bottom of the league with really low attendance. And now, they are not only winning games, they are getting a full squad."
Extra bases ■ Framingham, in the words of 35-year coach Dan Avery , has been a Jekyll and Hyde team, unfortunately. The Flyers pounded out 16 hits in a season-opening 11-1 Bay State Conference win over Milton before losing three straight games. In last week's matchup against third-ranked Braintree, however, junior righthander Tommy Clarke was superb, tossing a complete game while striking out five in a 10-1 BSC Carey win.
Faced with a bases-loaded, no-out jam in the top of the first inning, Clarke escaped trailing just 1-0, thanks to a pivotal double play turned by junior shortstop Nick Seeto . The Flyers then plated five runs in the third inning, one in the fourth, and four more in the sixth. Seeto, who is hitting .500, turned three double plays.
“The Braintree game, he was our ace," said Avery of the 6-foot-3, 210-pound Clarke, who has compiled a 1.16 earned run average with 21 strikeouts in 18 innings of work.
“He's gotten both of our wins. He's one of the top pitchers and he didn't get rattled. The double play was huge. I think from the time we turned the double play in the first inning, [Clarke] basically took control of the game. They didn't threaten again for the rest of the game.
■ Fourth-ranked Austin Prep (4-1, 3-0 Catholic Central) ran off four straight wins before being blanked by No. 1 Central Catholic, 4-0, on Saturday,
Coach Steve Busby's squad has outscored opponents 35-21 in the first five games of the season.
“Experience . . . we have a really strong nucleus and a really strong senior class," said Busby. “With our pitching, the guys are throwing strikes. The defense has been solid. We've swung the bat really well.
“We do consistently play pretty good defense . . . We work the count and make the pitchers work so they get tired. There are no easy outs in our lineup. It's very much a grind on the other team for the pitcher. It has a lot to do with guys returning. Some guys have been three or four-year starters. We've had a lot of success the last three years, so that gives guys a lot of confidence."
A pair of seniors, catcher Peter Burns and shortstop Logan Bravo , have provided the Cougars with solid production. Burns, a Boston College recruit, is hitting at a .412 clip with four RBIs. The Harvard-bound Bravo has seven RBIs while carrying a .467 average. Sophomore Andrew Croteau (2-0) has compiled a 1.27 ERA in 11 innings, striking out 10.
Players of the Week Robbie Gomes, Plymouth North – The junior catcher went 3 for 4 with a double and two RBIs to help the Eagles stay undefeated with an 11-3 win over Patriot League rival Plymouth South.
Paul Horgan, Hamilton-Wenham – The junior righthander fired his second consecutive no-hitter in a 10-0 Cape Ann League win over Lynnfield. He struck out three and walked three, not allowing a baserunner until the fourth inning.
Brendan Jones, Arlington – In the Spy Ponders' 13-4 Middlesex League win over Lexington, the sophomore second basemen had three hits, scored four times, and drove in a run.
Nick Sinacola, North Attleborough – The 6-foot-2 senior righthander tossed a 10-strikeout no-hitter in a 10-0 Hockomock League victory over Stoughton. The Maine commit did not issue a walk.
Matt Sullivan, BC High – In a 13-3 victory at Catholic Conference foe Malden Catholic, the senior from Boston hit for the cycle, ripping a single, double, triple and homer, and driving in six runs. He also reached base three times in a 13-6 non-league win against Newton North.
Games to Watch Wednesday, Catholic Memorial at BC High, 3:45 p.m. – This Catholic Conference bout features the second-ranked Eagles (5-2) and the No. 5 Knights (5-3).
Wednesday, Newton North at Wellesley, 3:45 p.m. – After losses to Malden Catholic and Norwood last week, the Raiders (4-3) bounced back against Natick on Saturday, 8-1. Now Wellesley can make it two straight in the BSC.
Friday, Lexington at Burlington, 3:45 p.m. – The Minutemen were dealt their first loss by Arlington. Now Lexington (5-1) will likely see ace Jack Pawloski on the mound in this Middlesex matchup.
Friday, Andover at Lowell, 7 p.m. – This Merrimack Valley rivalry will be played under the lights at Martin Alumni Athletic Complex as the No. 10 Golden Warriors look to remain a Top 10 team.
Saturday, Austin Prep at Bishop Fenwick, 2 p.m. – The Cougars go for the season sweep in the Catholic Central contest. Junior ace Colin Jaena could potentially get the start for Prep (4-1).

Texto completo: HEALTH CARE
American Well acquires another firm in telehealth industry American Well, a Boston company that provides technology for doctors to consult with patients via videoconferencing, has acquired another firm in the so-called telehealth industry, Avizia. While American Well focuses on connecting doctors to patients that don't have access to in-person health care or certain specialties, Avizia focuses on remote communication directly between clinicians. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. Avizia is based in Virginia and reports more than 1,300 hospital deployments, while American Well said its products are used by 75 health systems. The goal of the acquisition is to allow American Well to not only connect health care providers with patients wherever they are, but also to connect local clinicians with specialists to consult about a patient's specific issues. “You may have a rural hospital that needs a neurologist but doesn't have one on staff," said American Well chief executive Dr. Roy Schoenberg. “Bringing them together allows us to create a much broader switchboard of live health care services that can be rendered around the country." — MARGEAUX SIPPELL

Marathon Petroleum to buy rival for $23.3b in largest oil refiner deal Marathon Petroleum Corp. agreed to buy rival Andeavor for $23.3 billion in the biggest-ever deal for an oil refiner that would create the largest independent fuel maker in the United States. The offer, payable in either cash or shares, values Andeavor at about $152.27 a share, the companies said in a statement Monday. That represents a 24 percent premium over Friday's closing price. Marathon shares sank as much as 8.9 percent in early trading with analysts at RBC Capital Markets seeing the deal done at “peak refining bullishness." Andeavor rose as much as 18 percent. Shares of Andeavor, Marathon, and other independent refiners have soared to record highs this year. Growing fuel demand, both in the United States and Latin America, and a shale boom that's expanded access to relatively inexpensive domestic supply have given American refiners a leg up against foreign competitors. — BLOOMBERG NEWS
TIME SHARING
Marriott to buy rival ILG for about $4.7 billion Marriott's timeshare business is buying rival ILG in a cash-and-stock deal valued at about $4.7 billion. ILG has more than 250,000 owners in its Vistana Signature Experiences and Hyatt Vacation Ownership portfolios. The combined company will have the rights to develop, market and sell under the Hyatt Vacation Ownership programs. The combined company will include approximately 650,000 owners and seven upscale and luxury brands. ILG shareholders will receive $14.75 in cash and 0.165 shares of Marriott Vacations Worldwide stock for each ILG share. Marriott Vacations Worldwide Corp. said Monday that its board will expand from eight to 10 members to include two ILG directors. The deal is expected to close later this year. — ASSOCIATED PRESS

McDonald's sales rise on fresh patties and new value menu Higher prices on McDonald's menu led to surprisingly strong comparable-store sales during the first quarter, sending shares up sharply Monday. The company worked to grow its US business with new initiatives, like swapping out frozen beef patties for fresh ones in its Quarter Pounder burger. It also launched a new value menu earlier this year, reviving its once-popular Dollar Menu, but with items priced at $1, $2 or $3. Sales rose 2.9 percent at established restaurants in the United States, the company's biggest market. Worldwide, that figure rose 5.5 percent, which is a lot stronger than the 3.6 percent increase that industry analysts had forecast, according to a survey by FactSet. — ASSOCIATED PRESS
RETAIL
Walmart selling British unit to local rival Sainsbury's for $10.1b Walmart is selling its British unit, Asda, to local rival Sainsbury's for 7.3 billion pounds ($10.1 billion), a deal that lets the world's largest retailer focus on online sales in countries where it has stronger growth prospects and faces less-intense competition. The cash and stock deal will reshape Britain's supermarket industry. It combines the No. 2 and No. 3 supermarket chains, with a total 31.4 percent share of the market that would put it ahead of the current leader, Tesco, according to data from Kantar Worldpanel. — ASSOCIATED PRESS
ECONOMY
Americans increased their spending slightly in March Americans boosted their spending by 0.4 percent in March, the best showing in three months. Meanwhile, a key gauge of inflation closely watched by the Federal Reserve rose at the fastest pace in more than a year. The March increase in consumer spending followed two months of very weak readings with no gain in February and only a 0.2 percent increase in January, the Commerce Department reported Monday. — ASSOCIATED PRESS

Maine company to use grant to focus on growing scallops faster A Maine firm is set to receive a $300,000 grant to work on a scallop farming technique that has helped the valuable shellfish grow faster in Japan. Coastal Enterprises Inc. will receive the money via The Foundation for Food and Agriculture Research, which is a nonprofit corporation set up by the farm bill in 2014. Coastal will investigate the economic viability of the Japanese technique, which Pingree says has also been shown to grow larger, meatier scallops. The money is part of a round of grants from The Foundation for Food and Agriculture Research that will be matched by five companies, an industry group and three universities. — ASSOCIATED PRESS
MEDIA
Disney and Twitter team up to create live sports progamming, other content Walt Disney Co. is working with Twitter Inc. to create live sports programming and other content for the social-media platform, part of a push to turn Twitter's service into a destination for premium streaming video. Twitter and the Disney-owned ESPN sports network will announce specific live shows in development this week at their NewFront presentations, the companies said in an e-mailed statement. Disney's media portfolio includes television networks ABC, Disney Channel, and Freeform; the Disney Digital Network; Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures; Radio Disney; and the Marvel comic-book universe. — BLOOMBERG NEWS
MEDIA
New York Times to expand its television shows and podcasts The New York Times plans to expand its roster of television shows and podcasts, retooling popular columns and behind-the-scenes tales of its journalism to help attract subscribers who may have never read an article in the newspaper. Buoyed by the success of “The Daily," a hit podcast hosted by Michael Barbaro, Times executives see new storytelling tools as a gateway to audiences who may be coaxed into signing up for the newspaper, executives told advertisers at an event Monday in New York. Projects include a podcast for kids and “Caliphate," an audio series that tells the story of a Times reporter covering the Islamic State. The licensing fees and ads from TV shows and podcasts will be small at first, and unlikely to approach the revenue the company gets from traditional sources. But Times executives see them as tools to attract more subscribers, which now total 3.6 million, including customers for its crossword puzzle and cooking product. — BLOOMBERG NEWS

Texto completo: AUGUSTA, Maine — Court documents indicate a Maine man shot a sheriff's deputy in the head — but don't shed any light on the motive.
A state police affidavit became public Monday as 29-year-old John Williams made his initial court appearance in Augusta, Maine.
Williams is charged with killing 61-year-old Somerset County Cpl. Eugene Cole on April 25 in Norridgewock.

The affidavit indicates Williams then stole the deputy's cruiser, drove to a convenience store and stole some cigarettes. The affidavit indicates he confessed to the killing to friends.
He was captured on the fourth day of a manhunt Saturday.
Williams was not required to enter a plea, and a judge ordered him held without bail. A court-appointed defense lawyer said he wasn't ready to discuss specifics of the case.

Texto completo: Officials say John D. Williams spent three days evading 200 law enforcement officers. On Saturday, the fourth day of the manhunt, authorities arrested him, using the handcuffs of the sheriff's deputy they say he fatally shot.
"I thought that it was fitting," Somerset County Sheriff Dale Lancaster told reporters on Saturday afternoon. "He killed my deputy, Corporal Gene Cole, and he was brought to justice using Cole's handcuffs."
Cpl. Eugene Cole was fatally shot sometime after 1 a.m. Wednesday in the small Maine town of Norridgewock. Maine State Police said Williams killed the deputy before stealing his cruiser and committing a theft. Williams was seen on surveillance camera walking inside a convenience store minutes after the shooting.
The deputy's cruiser was found abandoned a few hours later.
The manhunt covered a large, wooded area near Norridgewock. Lt. Col. John Cote of the Maine State Police said dozens of officers who were divided in teams combed through rough terrain and found evidence, such as fresh foot tracks, suggesting that Williams was in the area. One of the teams spotted Williams at a remote campsite just before 1 p.m. Saturday, police said.
A photo shared on Facebook by Maine State Police showed Williams lying on his stomach with his hands behind his back while an officer grabbed a handful of his hair. Cote said officers needed to take a picture of Williams to confirm his identity, but Williams refused to raise his head.

Williams was not injured, Cote told reporters.
Photos taken by local media showed the heavily tattooed 29-year-old shirtless, barefoot and wrapped from the waist down with what appears to be a yellow tarp as he was being led by authorities.
The sheriff's office said Cole was a 13-year veteran of the agency.
"Had another officer been a victim in this case, we knew Gene would have been here every day, bringing his best effort to apprehend the suspect," Lancaster, the sheriff, told reporters. "He would've been proud of our efforts."
Lancaster said Cole's career epitomized what community policing meant.
"Part of the outpour we've had with this community was because of Gene's interaction with the people here," Lancaster said. "He was part of this community. He was their deputy sheriff."
Investigators declined to comment further on why Cole was killed. It's also unclear what charges Williams will face.
The FBI, along with local and state agencies, had offered a $20,000 reward for information leading to Williams's arrest.
Shortly before Williams was arrested, Cole's widow urged him to turn himself in.
"Mr. Williams, be assured you'll be treated the same way Corporal Cole would have treated you if you had given him the opportunity - with dignity and respect," according to the widow's statement, ABC affiliate WCJB reported. "We just want you to talk to someone. Please, please talk to us."

Texto completo: As Governor Charlie Baker pinned a gold medal to the lapel of Sidney Walton's blazer in the State House Monday, the 99-year-old World War II veteran grinned up at him from beneath the brim of his baseball cap, mentally checking another governor off his list.
Massachusetts was the Army veteran's second stop on a nationwide “No Regrets" tour to visit every governor in the country before making his last stop at the White House on Feb. 11, 2019, his 100th birthday. Accompanying him on the journey is his son, Paul.
“Before we started, we took him on a bucket list tour" of the world, Paul Walton said. Then they decided to embark on this tour.
Sidney Walton says his one regret in life is that he had a chance to meet Civil War veterans at a gathering in New York but decided not to go. Because he missed that opportunity, he's touring the states to make sure all 50 governors have a chance to meet a WWII veteran.
Baker welcomed Sidney Walton to his office shortly after 1 p.m. and presented him with a citation, declaring appreciation for his service, as well as a Governor's Medal of Merit. The two shared memories of Cambridge (where Walton once lived) — despite their Ivy league rivalries.
“Aw, geez, he's a Yalie?" Baker, a Harvard College alumnus, joked.
“Aren't you a Yalie?" Sidney Walton responded. The room erupted in laughter.
Baker read his citation to the veteran and thanked him for his service.
“Your tour serves as a true reflection of your character and your patriotism," Baker said.
Sidney Walton, a retired engineer from San Diego, was all smiles and said the honor was “wonderful." On Wednesday, the Waltons will go to a Red Sox game before heading to Maine to meet the next governor on the list.
To fund the tour, Paul Walton is raising money for his father at www.gosidneygo.com.

Widow of slain Maine sheriff's deputy speaks out; suspect appears in Maine courtroom

Texto completo: Sheryl Cole lost her husband, Somerset County Deputy Corporal Eugene P. Cole, to gunfire last week in the small town in Central Maine where Cole lived and worked as a law enforcement officer for the past 13 years.
In a powerful remembrance of him, Mrs. Cole wrote on Facebook about the last time she saw her husband of 41 years alive, how she spent her time as police worked for four days tracking down Cole's alleged killer, and how she is preparing for her own “new normal."
“I am the wife of Corporal Eugene Cole. I am not a widow (I always told him the 'til death do us part' thing wasn't going to get him out of anything). I am not a victim," she wrote. “With the help and support of my family, my community, and my country, I will get through this. I have to adjust to what will become the new normal."
The alleged shooter, John D. Williams, was ordered held without bail during his initial appearance Monday in an Augusta, Maine, courtroom. Williams was not required to enter a plea. The judge ordered a mental health examination and moved the case to Portland to ensure he gets a fair trial.
The Associated Press reported that Williams stared ahead and quietly answered a judge's questions.
Williams is charged with killing Cole last Wednesday on a darkened road in Norridgewock, Maine. Officials say the 29-year-old Williams also stole Cole's cruiser and robbed a convenience store. Williams was captured Saturday outside a remote cabin after a four-day manhunt.
A Maine State Police affidavit filed in court Monday said a police vehicle — it didn't specify whether it was Cole's — appeared in the early-morning hours as friends were dropping Williams off in front of a house. Cole's body was later found outside the home. The friends described Williams as antsy and having body armor with him.
The document alleged that Williams confessed the crime to a friend, but it didn't clarify Williams's motive. A court-appointed defense lawyer told reporters that he wasn't ready to discuss specifics of the case.
Mrs. Cole wrote in her Facebook post that at times people who look in her direction will see the loss she feels about her husband's death. “When you look at me, you may see the sorrow in my eyes, the reflection of a gold badge with the number 1312 across it," she wrote, referring to the badge number for her husband.
Williams was due in Haverhill District Court later on the day Cole was shot to death. He told a friend he did not want to return to Massachusetts because he feared spending 10 years behind bars if convicted for an illegal gun possession charge.
The circumstances of Cole's shooting have not been publicly disclosed. The shooting took place between 1 a.m. and 2 a.m. Williams allegedly then robbed the store while using Cole's cruiser, which was found around 5 a.m. on Martin Stream Road, police said. Cole's body was found around 7:15 a.m. on the lawn of a woman in Norridgewock who helped raise Williams.
In her Facebook posting, Sheryl Cole did not discuss the circumstances of her husband's death. Instead she focused on how the support from neighbors, strangers, law enforcement, and her relatives buoyed her after Cole's murder, and during the days Williams was on the run. She also wrote that she read every word she could find about her husband, with whom she raised four children to adulthood.
“The last five days have been the purest form of hell and torture," she wrote. “The waiting when they couldn't find his body, the finality when they did, and the uncertainty of the days that followed."
She added: “I have read every single word. As sad it makes me, and how hard it is to read through tears, it touches my heart and gives it that tiny lift it so desperately needs right now. So to you all — a heartfelt thank you."
Visiting hours will be held Sunday at the Skowhegan Armory in Skowhegan. A celebration of Cole's life will be held May 7 at the Cross Insurance Center in Bangor.

Advocates take Maine Medicaid expansion fight with LePage to court

Texto completo: AUGUSTA, Maine -- Supporters of Medicaid expansion sued Maine on Monday to force state officials to implement the voter-approved law that has been held up by Gov. Paul LePage, who has stalled it for months while imploring the Legislature to first fund it on his terms.
In doing so, they put Attorney General Janet Mills on the hot seat, with a lawyer saying the suit will end quickly if the Democratic gubernatorial candidate and frequent foe of the Republican governor agrees with them because she controls the state's legal representation.
The lawsuit against the Maine Department of Health and Human Services was filed Monday in Kennebec County Superior Court by Maine Equal Justice Partners, a progressive anti-poverty group, health groups and individuals who would be eligible for coverage in July under the law.
Maine became the first state to pass expansion under the Affordable Care Act at the ballot box in 2017, where 59 percent of voters backed it. But LePage -- who has five times vetoed Medicaid expansion efforts passed by the Legislature -- has blocked it thus far.
A day after it passed, the Republican governor said that he wouldn't implement it unless lawmakers fund it at a disputed cost estimate and without tax hikes or raids of Maine's surplus fund. Democrats have argued that it doesn't need to be fully funded immediately.
But on Monday, Robyn Merrill, the executive director of Maine Equal Justice Partners, said the state's surplus -- estimated earlier this year to be more than $130 million -- could be used to fund expansion immediately and that the governor's roadblocks constituted "excuses."
"He really doesn't have any excuses any longer, but the fact of the matter is the law is the law and he needs to follow it," Merrill said.
The voter-approved law set out a specific timeframe for Maine to implement expansion. By April 3, the state was supposed to send an expansion plan to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, but the deadlined came and went.
Since then, advocates have contended that the state is in "clear" violation of the law, and by July 2, the state is supposed to be covering an estimated 70,000 more people with incomes between 101 percent and 138 percent of the federal poverty level.
LePage spokesman Peter Steele said in an email that he "cannot comment on active litigation," but that the governor's position hasn't changed since he outlined his conditions for expansion in a December letter to legislative leaders.
On Monday, James Kilbreth, an attorney representing the groups that are suing the state, said that Mills could end the suit "within a day or two" if she agrees with their position. In a brief statement, Mills shot back by saying that Kilbreth was "wrong" that she could end the suit because she isn't a party to it.
The issue is laden with election-year politics. Mills is one of seven Democrats running in a June primary for the nomination to replace the term-limited LePage, and her office controls legal representation for state agencies, though she has often been in conflict with LePage and has often refused to represent him in certain cases.
LePage sued Mills over that last year, but his complaint was dismissed. State law says that Mills must sign off before a state government entity can hire outside lawyers to represent it. While that power could be used in a bid to block LePage's legal effort, the Maine Supreme Judicial Court said in 2015 that it was unaware of any time that approval has been withheld.

American Legion baseball faces continuing battle for survival in Maine

Texto completo: With Maine's American Legion baseball ranks continuing to be thinned by the popularity of regional travel baseball programs, state American Legion baseball officials have held frequent planning sessions in an effort to adapt to the sport's changing summer landscape.
"It was a long offseason," said Dave Paul, a longtime commissioner for Zone 1, which covers northern Maine. "We usually meet a couple of times leading up to our state meeting. I think we met five times this year and I still don't quite know if we've got everything done or not.
"We've been sort of in a state of change trying to figure out exactly who was still going to have a Senior or Junior Legion team or both and who was not."
The number of Senior Legion teams -- largely for older high school players -- has dipped dramatically in Maine during the last decade, from a high of 48 in 2007 to 27 last summer. Several Cumberland County communities started their own high school-age leagues for weekday games in order to free up weekends for travel-team competition.
That trend has extended farther south this year, with several former York County legion teams taking the same path as the number of Senior Legion teams statewide has fallen to 20.
The nosedive from 48 teams to 20 represents a decrease of 58 percent in only 11 years.
"All those places have decided to go in another direction and leave the weekends open so those kids can play travel baseball. That's the way it's heading," Paul said. "We're not going to fight it, we'll just continue to move forward and keep promoting the tradition of American Legion baseball, the history of American Legion, the strength of American Legion baseball and the fact that kids are together every day for five or six weeks shooting for a zone tournament berth followed hopefully by a state tournament and possibly a chance to go to the New Englands and a World Series."
Some legion officials have discussed adapting regular-season schedules to play two or three days during the week to accommodate the growing interest in travel baseball across southern Maine.
"But it always gets back to the crunch we're under with the time frame we have to get our games in," Paul said. "Everything is based off when the [legion] World Series takes place and we have to work backward from that."
The Maine American Legion baseball regular season begins in mid-June at the end of the high school season but must be completed by mid-July to accommodate zone, state and regional tournaments that ultimately qualify teams for the Senior Legion World Series, set this year for Aug. 16-21 in Shelby, North Carolina.
"Legion's been such a great program over the years, but we've got to adapt to where we're at," said Dave Morris, coach of the reigning state champion Bangor Senior Legion club. "I think there's a compromise with what kids are doing, and at the same time Legion is trying to do different things."The survivors
Maine's remaining Senior Legion teams will be divided into three regions or zones, one fewer than in 2017. There were as many as five as recently as 2014.
The northernmost zone overseen by Paul is on track to experience the least change this year, remaining at six Senior Legion teams as Post 51 of Oakland and Skowhegan will merge their efforts while Motor City of the Bangor area returns after a one-year hiatus.
Motor City and Post 51-Skowhegan will be joined in Zone 1 by Bangor, Brewer, Hampden and Trenton.
Zone 2 will have eight teams: Rogers Post 153 of Auburn, Locke Mills of Bethel, the Capitals of South China, Bessey Motors of South Paris, Augusta Elks, Franklin County Flyers of Farmington, Pastime Club of Lewiston and Rumford-Dirigo.
Zone 3 will have six teams, including two survivors from York County, the Waterboro Eagles and Staples Crossing of South Berwick. Other entries are Coastal Landscaping of Portland (Cheverus High School), Post 202 of Topsham, Post 86 United (Gray-Cumberland-Freeport) and Yankee Ford of South Portland.
Plans for the zone and state tournaments have yet to be confirmed, but eight-team and six-team state tourney formats are being considered.
"We'd like to keep it at eight to reward as many teams as we can," Paul said. "But on the other hand if we only have 20 senior teams, that's almost 50 percent going to the state tournament. We haven't gotten that far yet."A Junior Legion boost?
One source of possible optimism for American Legion baseball, particularly in its more northern reaches, involves the Junior Legion division for younger high school players.
Paul said Junior Legion teams are expected to number in the low-20s statewide this summer, including a bump up to 11 in Zone 1. Teams are planned for Bangor, Brewer, Motor City, Trenton, Waldo County, Penquis (Dover-Foxcroft), Skowhegan, Fairfield, Oakland and two from Hampden.
"We've talked in our area about how in order to stay strong and viable there should be more Junior Legion teams than Senior Legion teams theoretically," Paul said. "Those kids hopefully will filter up through as they get older and become the Senior Legion players."
Some of Junior Legion's growth in eastern Maine may stem from the loss of the Little League-franchised Senior League World Series and its automatic bid for the host team -- which concluded a 15-year stay in Bangor in 2016.
"Those kids are your incoming freshmen and sophomores and some of your juniors," he said. "If they are going to need a place to play during the summer I think Junior Legion is a perfect fit."
Paul also hopes the Waldo County and Penquis Junior Legion entries could lead to the re-introduction of Senior Legion baseball in those areas.
"It's like a JV and a varsity if that's what you want to call it," Paul said. "Hopefully, that will keep the interest there so the kids can eventually transition up to the next level of legion baseball."
Morris said Junior Legion's success is pivotal to the health of Senior Legion baseball in the region.
"It's tough playing legion baseball, it takes a great deal of sacrifice from kids," he said. "Hopefully, the Junior Legion teams really grow because that's really going to be key in the development of baseball around here because geographically it's hard to go from Dover-Foxcroft to Boston for travel baseball.
"In the southern part of the state, they have a little easier situation."

Texto completo: A faux pas in politics is often defined as telling the truth, intentional or otherwise. By this definition, Mick Mulvaney, a former congressman and the White House's budget director, made a faux pas last week when he let the world know that money talks in the nation's capital.
The substance of the revelation is not shocking; most people know that big donors to campaigns, candidates and political organizations are made in the hopes of influencing policies to be more beneficial to the donors and their interests.
What was surprising about Mulvaney's comments was how unabashed he was in stating this truth.
"If you're a lobbyist who never gave us money, I didn't talk to you. If you're a lobbyist who gave us money, I might talk to you," Mulvaney said at an American Bankers Association conference last week. He served in the U.S. House of Representatives for six years, representing South Carolina's 5th Congressional District. He served on the Financial Services and Small Business Committees.
The implication was clear -- if you want to be heard in Washington, donate money to the people who have the power to do what you want.
Mulvaney appears to have continued that mindset while working for the White House, as both the director of the Office of Management and Budget and the head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the latter on a temporary basis.
According to an analysis by The Daily Beast, Mulvaney has kept the practice of prioritizing meetings with donors. In his first nine months at the Office of Management and Budget, Mulvaney met with eight lobbyists and six executives who had donated to his congressional campaigns, visitor logs show. All had interests before federal agencies or finances that could be affected by the bureau.
"It sounds like Mulvaney is importing his pay to play operation from Congress into the administration," Brendan Fischner, the director of federal reform programs at the Campaign Legal Center, a watchdog group, said in an email to The Daily Beast.
This is not surprising in an administration that has little regard for ethics. President Donald Trump himself has refused to cut ties with his company, the Trump Organization, and he and his family often appear to be using the presidency to promote their business interests.
The Trump administration may be an egregious example, but buying influence is nothing new in Washington. "Mulvaney's words, and apparently his actions, are just unvarnished examples of how the entire political system is tilted in favor of deep-pocketed special interests," Fischner said.
There is one important caveat to Mulvaney's congressional meeting hierarchy -- his constituents were at the top of the meeting list, whether they contributed money or not. "If you came from back home and sat in my lobby, I talked to you without exception, regardless of the financial contributions," Mulvaney told the bankers last week.
This is a lesson Rep. Bruce Poliquin should heed. The 2nd Congressional District representative does not allow anyone, including constituents, into his local offices without a pre-arranged appointment. Appointments at offices in Maine are typically with staff members, not the congressman himself.
By speaking the truth, Mulvaney reminds Americans of the sad truth that much of Congress and the White House aren't working for them, but rather for the deep-pocketed donors who can buy access.

Texto completo: A police affidavit released Monday after the first court appearance of a man accused of slaying a Somerset County deputy sheriff last week points to how the two may have encountered each other, but offers no motive for the crime.
John D. Williams, 29, of Madison is charged with intentional or knowing murder in the death Wednesday of Cpl. Eugene Cole, 61, of Norridgewock. Williams made his first court appearance Monday before Superior Court Justice Robert Mullen at the Capital Judicial Center in Augusta.
Williams, who appeared to be wearing a bulletproof vest under a blue dress shirt in court, was not asked Monday to enter a plea to the charge because he has not yet been indicted by a grand jury.
He softly answered questions from Mullen about whether he understood the charges. Williams said he did.
The judge ordered that Williams be held without bail at the Maine State Prison in Warren, where he has been since his arrest. Mullen also ordered that the defendant undergo a psychological evaluation.
Williams was arrested Saturday on the Norridgewock/Fairfield town line, following an intense four-day manhunt.
According to the affidavit, filed Wednesday by police, Cole began his shift at 4 p.m. Tuesday, April 24, dressed in his uniform and wearing his gun belt. He was driving a white, marked Chevrolet Silverado pickup truck bearing a county license plate.
Cole apparently was leaving the Cumberland Farms store in Norridgewock sometime after 1 a.m. Wednesday. A sheriff's pickup truck was parked at the gas pumps and Cole was on the phone with another Somerset County deputy around that time when the call ended abruptly, the affidavit states.
Meanwhile, Williams had asked his friends, Christopher Shulenski, 31, and Brittany Roseberry, 26, of Skowhegan to meet him about 1 a.m. Wednesday at an apartment complex in Skowhegan. He wanted them to drive him to his former residence on Mercer Road in Norridgewock, the affidavit said, which is half a mile from the Cumberland Farms.
When the couple met Williams, he was with Christopher Williams, 39, of Skowhegan. The two men are not related, the affidavit said.
John Williams moved several bags, a bulletproof vest and a shotgun from Christopher Williams' car to Shulenski's, witnesses allegedly said. Shulenski and Roseberry both told police that they dropped the defendant off at a home in Norridgewock where John Williams previously lived.
Shulenski told detectives at about 9 a.m. Wednesday -- less than two hours after Cole's body was found in the yard of 16 Mercer Road in Norridgewock -- that when he'd dropped off John Williams, he'd seen a Somerset County Sheriff's Department pickup truck drive slowly by and the driver stepped on its brakes.
Shulenski stated that John Williams told him that he should not leave, but "Shulenski and Roseberry left Norridgewock and returned to Skowhegan," the affidavit said.
What happened next between Cole and Williams was not included in the affidavit, but John Williams called Christopher Williams at 1:30 a.m. and confessed to killing Cole and stealing the pickup, the document said.
"Chris [Williams] explained that John [Williams] told him Cpl. Cole snuck up on him, or John snuck up on Cpl. Cole," the affidavit said.
Christopher Williams allegedly told police he picked the defendant up at John Williams' request on Martin Stream Road. John Williams, who had taken out a crack pipe, demanded the other man's cellphone and his car. Christopher Williams gave the defendant his cellphone but told him to get out of the car, which he did.
At about 1:45 a.m., a clerk at the Cumberland Farms in Norridgewock reported that a male carrying a handgun in the waistband of his pants took a pack of cigarettes without paying.
Cole's county-issued vehicle was found at 5:08 a.m. at 508 Martin Stream Road.
Cole's body was discovered at about 7:30 a.m. by Kimberly Sirois, 54, at her home on Mercer Road, the affidavit said. She told police that John Williams had lived with her until Christmas 2017, when she told him to leave due to drug use. She did not hear gunshots but did hear her dogs barking in the middle of the night and did not get up to check on them, according to the affidavit.
Also made public Monday was Cole's cause of death, listed in the affidavit as a perforating gunshot wound to the neck with perforation of the cervical spinal cord.
Williams reportedly was distraught over a scheduled court appearance last Wednesday in Massachusetts in an illegal gun case that could lead to a sentence of more than 10 years in prison, according to a spokeswoman for the Essex County district attorney's office and court documents.
He was arrested in Massachusetts on March 22 and faces a variety of charges, including possessing a firearm without a license. He posted bail on March 31, according to state police and Carrie Kimball Monahan of the Essex County district attorney's office.
His girlfriend, Kristina A. Pomerleau, 32, of Norridgewock, was arrested on April 21 on drug charges. She remains at the Somerset County Jail unable to post bail.
Williams could face other charges because he allegedly stole Cole's police vehicle, stole merchandise from a convenience store and may have burglarized camps while fleeing from authorities.
Also Monday, the judge agreed to move the case to Cumberland County.
Defense attorneys Verne Paradie and Patrick Nickerson of Lewiston were appointed to represent Williams.
After the hearing, Nickerson read a statement about his firm's decision to represent Williams, but took no questions about the case or his client.
Because the alleged crimes took place in Somerset County, Williams' first appearance typically would have been held at the courthouse in Skowhegan. The Augusta courthouse, which opened in 2014, is considered more secure.
Security in the courtroom was heavy Monday. The case has drawn reporters from as far south as Boston.
If convicted of murder, Williams faces 25 years to life in prison. The Maine Supreme Judicial Court has found that a life sentence may be imposed if the victim was an on-duty police officer, as Cole was.
Deputy Attorney General Lisa Marchese said outside the courthouse that her office would seek a life sentence if Williams is convicted of murder.

Eves campaign staff is first in Maine history to unionize

Texto completo: EDITOR'S NOTE: Since our staff cannot meet with all candidates or cover their campaign events, we have created this site to share candidate press releases and statements with our readers. The items are posted in their words and unedited. The views expressed are their own and do not necessarily reflect the views of Northeast Publishing.
PORTLAND, Maine -- On Sunday, staff for Mark Eves' campaign for governor and the board of the Campaign Workers Guild (CWG) voted to accept a collective bargaining agreement, making his the first political campaign in New England history, and only the third governor's race in America, to unionize. The contract establishes guidelines for minimum pay, workplace health and safety, and procedures for hiring and firing, among other protections. The staff chose to affiliate with CWG, an independent national union founded earlier this year.
Eves supported the efforts of his staff to organize, saying, "It is long past due that Democratic candidates who claim to stand up for working people walk the walk and encourage their own campaigns to organize. I want every Mainer to have access to health care, paid family leave, and protections from workplace abuse. I will push for those policies as governor and until then I'll do what I can to ensure my staff have them now."
Eves' commitment to working people was additionally recognized Saturdaywhen, at the Labor Gubernatorial Debate in Winslow, he won the Democratic primary straw poll of union members in attendance. The debate was co-hosted by the Maine AFL-CIO, Maine Education Association, Maine State Employees Association, and Maine State Building & Construction Trades Council.
"I'm proud to be a part of a campaign that's actually living Democratic values and not just talking about them," said Claire Cummings, Field Director for the campaign. "It wasn't a surprise that Mark would support this decision - he's always been on the side of working Mainers - but it's still very exciting for all of us. Hopefully our decision to unionize will a new standard for campaign work in Maine."
Staffers in other campaigns have faced opposition to unionization from candidates and campaign managers, even as many of those same candidates espouse pro-labor positions. Earlier this month, National Public Radio quoted a retired Democratic campaign manager as claiming that unionization would hurt Democratic candidates.
Meg Reilly, who serves as the national Vice President of CWG and lives in Portland, thinks that is hypocritical.
"We are sick and tired of candidates who identify themselves as pro-union or pro-worker when they fail to guarantee the same labor rights they claim to support," she said.
Eves agreed:
"Throughout my career I have always supported organized labor because I think every working person – whether they work at a paper mill, a nursing home, or on a political campaign – is better off when they have the protections of a union. If you can't rely on a candidate to treat their own workers with dignity, how can you expect them to stand up for workers when they get elected?"
Eves is the son of a public-school teacher and a retired military chaplain. A licensed family therapist, Eves spent eight years in the Maine House of Representatives, including two terms as Speaker. During that time, he earned a career 98% voting record from the Maine AFL-CIO and consistently stood up to Governor LePage's attempts to weaken organized labor. Eves lives in North Berwick with his wife Laura, their three young children, four goats, two pigs and a coop full of chickens.

Texto completo: The U.S. Coast Guard told Rockland officials on Thursday that it would not seek to establish a federal anchorage in the outer harbor to accommodate large cruise ships.
Coast Guard Cmdr. Andy Meyers wrote in an email Thursday to the city that larger cruise ships could still anchor in the Broad Cove area, the Courier Gazette reported Friday.
The Penobscot Bay and River Pilots Association, whose member captains pilot large foreign-flagged vessels into port, has said the requested anchorage in Broad Cove, located in Owls Head, would provide more safety for cruise ships entering the harbor.
But some worried that establishing the anchorage would attract more cruise ships to the city
Meyers said in the email that the Coast Guard would not initiate a notice of proposed rulemaking to establish the federal anchorage.
Rockland City Manager Tom Luttrell did not immediately return a phone call on Monday.
Staff writer Lauren Abbate contributed to this report.

Texto completo: EDITOR'S NOTE: Since our staff cannot meet with all candidates or cover their campaign events, we have created this site to share candidate press releases and statements with our readers. The items are posted in their words and unedited. The views expressed are their own and do not necessarily reflect the views of Northeast Publishing.
PORTLAND, Maine -- On Sunday, staff for Mark Eves' campaign for governor and the board of the Campaign Workers Guild (CWG) voted to accept a collective bargaining agreement, making his the first political campaign in New England history, and only the third governor's race in America, to unionize. The contract establishes guidelines for minimum pay, workplace health and safety, and procedures for hiring and firing, among other protections. The staff chose to affiliate with CWG, an independent national union founded earlier this year.
Eves supported the efforts of his staff to organize, saying, "It is long past due that Democratic candidates who claim to stand up for working people walk the walk and encourage their own campaigns to organize. I want every Mainer to have access to health care, paid family leave, and protections from workplace abuse. I will push for those policies as governor and until then I'll do what I can to ensure my staff have them now."
Eves' commitment to working people was additionally recognized Saturdaywhen, at the Labor Gubernatorial Debate in Winslow, he won the Democratic primary straw poll of union members in attendance. The debate was co-hosted by the Maine AFL-CIO, Maine Education Association, Maine State Employees Association, and Maine State Building & Construction Trades Council.
"I'm proud to be a part of a campaign that's actually living Democratic values and not just talking about them," said Claire Cummings, Field Director for the campaign. "It wasn't a surprise that Mark would support this decision - he's always been on the side of working Mainers - but it's still very exciting for all of us. Hopefully our decision to unionize will a new standard for campaign work in Maine."
Staffers in other campaigns have faced opposition to unionization from candidates and campaign managers, even as many of those same candidates espouse pro-labor positions. Earlier this month, National Public Radio quoted a retired Democratic campaign manager as claiming that unionization would hurt Democratic candidates.
Meg Reilly, who serves as the national Vice President of CWG and lives in Portland, thinks that is hypocritical.
"We are sick and tired of candidates who identify themselves as pro-union or pro-worker when they fail to guarantee the same labor rights they claim to support," she said.
Eves agreed:
"Throughout my career I have always supported organized labor because I think every working person – whether they work at a paper mill, a nursing home, or on a political campaign – is better off when they have the protections of a union. If you can't rely on a candidate to treat their own workers with dignity, how can you expect them to stand up for workers when they get elected?"
Eves is the son of a public-school teacher and a retired military chaplain. A licensed family therapist, Eves spent eight years in the Maine House of Representatives, including two terms as Speaker. During that time, he earned a career 98% voting record from the Maine AFL-CIO and consistently stood up to Governor LePage's attempts to weaken organized labor. Eves lives in North Berwick with his wife Laura, their three young children, four goats, two pigs and a coop full of chickens.

Texto completo: Support ranked-choice voting
As a lifelong Republican voter, I have chosen to support ranked-choice voting. The recent Maine Supreme Judicial Court ruling favoring ranked-choice voting for the June primaries gives Maine voters an opportunity to use the system that they have clearly favored. Until the court ruled, the process had become so convoluted that it looked like the voters would not be allowed to use the system.
The people of Maine approved ranked-choice voting in 2016, but legislators tried to kill the proposal. The people fought back, collecting more than 80,000 signatures for the people's veto. We now have the opportunity to pass it again in June and to use ranked-choice voting in the primaries.
Maine voters will have the opportunity to rank their choices in situations where there are more than two candidates, and that means that the winners will have majority support from the Maine voters. Ballots are counted in rounds where last place finishers lose until one candidate receives a majority and is declared the winner.
This June primary is an opportunity for all voters to express their true preference. I hope others will join me in voting yes on ranked-choice voting -- Question 1 -- and helping prove that the system will be best for Maine in all future elections.

Wind turbine fire danger
Google Caithness Windfarm Information Forum's "windfarm accident reports" and "wind turbine fires" for data on turbine fires. The forum's entries are derived from world media accounts because no government records turbine fires. Lack of official data enables wind power advocates to claim fires are rare. The forum reports 312 turbine fires since 2000, some involving oil spills or creating fires in fields and forests.
Maine is especially vulnerable. Its turbines are placed high up on forested mountain sides. Leading causes of turbine fires are overheated gearboxes and lightning strikes. Science knows higher elevations are more susceptible to lightning. Maine is fortunate its two turbine fires occurred in snowy winters, not during droughts.
Denmark recently led a second European effort to curb fires by creating a joint investigatory commission. In 2010, a similar European commission recommended hiring state inspectors who would test lubricants in independent laboratories every two to five years in efforts to reduce friction in gearboxes.
Maine has no independent inspectors or state laboratories that make such tests despite the fact lubricants do break down. Maine also has no operating regulations or limits on numbers, and no plan. Laissez-faire rules.
Maine people should realize that turbines involve placing 350- to 450-foot poles containing 250 to 250 gallons of flammable liquid hundreds of feet in the air (football fields are only 300 feet, goal to goal).
Where are our environmentalists, foresters and responsible legislators? Nowhere.

A path to recovery
Lauren Abbate's recent article on community resources for alcoholism and addiction did a good job pointing out the lack of public paid resources. For someone who really wants to stop, however, resources are there, such as Narcotics Anonymous and Alcoholics Anonymous, which the article glibly glossed over.
They are right there in every community across the state, and they are free. For the person who truly really seeks recovery, AA is an effective program. Meetings are governed by alcoholics and drug addicts, and for them. Part of the recovery is hearing your own story in others and identifying with it. Another part of recovery is learning to help others, and not focusing on yourself. It may start as simply as making the coffee or telling your story to someone who needs to hear it, the focus is on doing something positive.
Unfortunately, for AA to remain fully anonymous for the protection of its members, it uses the attraction, not promotion, theme as its mantra. An addict needs to hear the stories of recovery from another recovering addict to be convinced it will work. If the addict really needs help, he only needs to go to his first AA meeting to hear about recovery. It is there and functioning well, and it is fully self-supporting through its own contributions.

A generational misunderstanding
Barbara Bush had a great response, as highlighted in a recent column in the BDN, to the 1990 Wellesley College petition objecting to her invitation to speak at graduation on the grounds that women should be "rewarded on the basis of our own merit, not on that of a spouse." We have a generational misunderstanding.
My mother, of the Barbara Bush generation, proudly described herself as a "homemaker." She wasn't ambitious for personal achievement, but she had a strong sense of purpose. She ran a serene, well-ordered home for four children: home-cooked meals every night, growing and canning healthy food, sewing clothes, selecting books and newspapers, encouraging us to be well-read citizens, and organizing our neighbors to force a local industry to clean up polluting smokestacks. She had a high-school diploma; she wasn't "privileged."
In her childhood, most girls were raised to be wives, mothers, homemakers, involved in their church and community. At that time, our nation believed that our collective well-being lay in stable homes and families, and girls were raised to be the stewards of this responsibility. We didn't idealize so much the amazing individual.
Now we teach our daughters that their grandmothers were "oppressed" and bored with their lot. And some probably were. But as time passes, my respect grows for what that generation of unpaid and unsung homemakers did for this country, their communities and the children they raised. It was a nice time to grow up.

On whose side is Poliquin?
The talk about the huge amounts of money raised by Rep. Bruce Poliquin is not such a surprise when one realizes how much money he has received from the NRA. We can only wonder to whom he owes his allegiance, the NRA or the children of America, who with good reason fear for their safety?
As a concerned mom and grandmom, all I ask is for reasonable gun laws: background checks, a ban on assault weapons and a waiting period for gun purchases. The momentum is now on our side. We need someone in Congress who represents our interests, not that of the NRA.

Texto completo: Olof Olsson Nylander was the youngest child born to Ola Larsson and Elisabeth Jonsdotter on June 14, 1864. He had two brothers, Jacob and Lars; one sister, Elna; and six other siblings who died in infancy. Ola worked as a shoemaker and had a plum orchard on the farm of Öremolla, in Skivarp, Malmöhus County, Sweden.
Growing up on this small farm about a half-mile from the Baltic Sea, Olof spent a lot of time playing along the shore and collecting shells. Olof's love of learning from and observing nature was just beginning. Because he was a bright child, his parents taught him reading and math before he started school.
When Olof was about 16 years old he moved to Stockholm, Sweden, to learn to paint houses with a cousin. Evenings and weekends, Olof would be at one of the museums and libraries studying and learning what he could about their numerous collections.
Olof's brothers immigrated to America in 1880; Jacob settled in Woodland, Maine and Lars worked in the Boston area. Olof soon followed them in 1883 and stayed in the Boston area for about three years, working at a paint shop, studying at the museums in the Boston area, and exploring the East Coast. Olof eventually settled in the town of Woodland, and in the spring of 1886 his parents and sister Elna emigrated from Sweden to live with him.
Olof married Wilhelmina Christina Johanson on Jan 1, 1902. Wilhelmina's family had also emigrated from Sweden; her father, Carl J. Johanson, came in 1871 to begin building a home for his family. Wilhelmina came a year later with her mother, Maria, brother, Karl, and grandparents, Lars and Brita Björkdahl. Carl and Maria had seven more children, all born in Maine.
Olof and "Mina" had three children: Eldena, Henry and Gladia. Eldena married George Ketch of Woodland and they raised nine children. Henry had a serious head injury while skiing when he was about 21 and never fully recovered. He was 82 when he died at a nursing home in Dexter. Gladia was only 10 months old when she died from cholera infantum in 1908.
This column was written by a Nylander family member.

Texto completo: The University of Maine's baseball team finds itself perilously close to the cellar in America East after getting swept by the University of Maryland, Baltimore County in Baltimore over the weekend.
The team that finishes last in the seven-team conference doesn't qualify for the league tournament and the tourney is going to be held in Orono on May 23-27.
The Black Bears mustered only 17 hits in the three games as defending tournament champ UMBC is now 7-1 over its last eight games.
UMBC's Matt Chanin and Greg Albert combined on a five-hitter on Sunday as UMBC triumphed 5-2 after coming from behind on Saturday to post 9-4 and 7-4 victories.
The Retrievers scored nine unanswered runs in Saturday's opener to erase a 4-0 deficit and wiped out a 3-0 deficit with six straight runs in the nightcap.
UMBC improved to 9-6 in the conference, 17-20 overall, while the Black Bears fell to 6-9 and 11-28, respectively. The Black Bears have now lost five conference games in a row.
UMaine owns just a half-game lead over last-place Binghamton (7-11, 11-25-1) and Binghamton will visit UMaine for a three-game set next weekend.
On Sunday, UMaine sophomore reliever Cody Laweryson made just his second career start and pitched four scoreless innings before UMBC scored a run in the fifth to break a scoreless deadlock and chased him in a four-run fifth-inning rally.
Matt Campbell singled in the fifth and eventually scored on Zack Bright's sacrifice fly.
In the sixth, Raven Beeman and Collin Stack singled and Zack DeThomasis' squeeze bunt single scored Beeman. Campbell's ensuing squeeze went for an RBI single and A.J. Wright walked. Jonah Normandeau replaced Laweryson and Bright's groundout delivered another run before a Joey Goodwin sacrifice fly capped the rally.
UMaine reached Albert for a pair of runs in the ninth as Jeremy Pena and Danny Casals each singled before a one-out groundout by Chris Bec delivered Pena. Following a walk to Jonathan Bennett and his stolen base, Caleb Kerbs singled home Casals but Bennett was thrown out at the plate to end the game.
Christian Torres, Goodwin, Dimitri Floyd and Campbell all had two hits for UMBC and Pena had two singles for UMaine. Campbell, Bright and UMaine's Brandon Vicens had doubles.
On Saturday, after Casals' two-run single highlighted a three-run second-inning rally in the nightcap, Beeman hit a solo homer in the second and a five-run third inning that gave UMBC the lead for good featured Bright's two-run homer and Beeman's two-run triple off UMaine starter and loser John Arel, who had no-hit UMass Lowell in his previous outing.
Beeman also had a single to go with his triple and homer in the game. Wright doubled and singled and Floyd singled twice.
Pena homered and singled for Maine and knocked in a pair of runs and Hernen Sardinas doubled and singled.
In the Saturday opener, a decisive seven-run third-inning rally featured a grand slam by Stack after Bright had walloped a two-run homer off starter and loser Zach Winn.
UMaine had built its 4-0 lead thanks to Bennett's two-run double and RBI single.
Goodwin had three singles for UMBC, Bright had a double to go with his homer and Beeman singled twice.
Bennett's double and single represented two of UMaine's four hits.

Where Democrats who want to be Maine's next governor stand on raising taxes to pay for home care

Texto completo: In addition to electing a new governor and 186 legislators in November, Mainers will again vote on whether to raise the income tax rate on higher earners.
In 2016, voters approved a 3 percent surtax earmarked for public education, but Republicans in the Legislature thwarted its implementation as written. This year, the revenue from increasing the tax rate for income that proponents say would define earners as "wealthy" would pay to expand direct-care services for older and disabled Mainers.
A coalition led by the progressive Maine People's Alliance has proposed the creation of a new Home Care Universal Trust Fund and collected enough signatures to put the issue on the November ballot. The initiative would claim a total of 3.8 percent of payroll taxes from income above $127,200 annually to fund daily in-home living services for people older than 65 and people with disabilities, regardless of their income. Proponents estimate the new taxes could generate $132 million per year.
With the focus on the current legislative session and the primary election in June, there has been little public debate about the proposal, which would fall to the next Legislature and governor to implement if voters endorse it. Given that overseeing a tax increase and implementing the program could become their responsibility, the Bangor Daily News surveyed the candidates for governor who have qualified for primary ballots about their thoughts on the measure.
All four Republicans running for the party's nomination said they oppose the proposal. A summary of their responses will appear elsewhere.
Responses from Democrats appear below. Some wording has been edited for grammar and brevity.
Position on the referendum
The Maine People's Alliance and other groups have spearheaded a citizen-initiated referendum to create a universal home health care system for all elderly and disabled Mainers, regardless of income. The program would be supported by a total of 3.8 percent payroll taxes for employers and employees on income above $127,200 annually. Do you support the initiative? Explain.
Betsy Sweet: "Yes, I support the initiative. Our health care system is simply not serving everyone adequately and our seniors in particular are hit the hardest. This initiative will provide much-needed care to those who have done so much for Maine and, as governor, I will work to make sure it is fully implemented when the people pass it."
Janet Mills: "It's critical that we ensure seniors and Maine people with disabilities have access to quality care and can stay in their homes. That's why I support restoring our public health system, including undoing [Republican Gov. Paul] LePage's devastating cuts to public health nursing, and have fought to expand Medicaid. I share the goals of this referendum, but I have yet to review the proposed statutory language."
Donna Dion: "In reviewing the bill we have two sections to focus on. Section 5002: Imposition on employer, which seems to require an employer to tax employees who exceed the $127,200 threshold from Social Security. Now review section 5204-D: Additional tax on high earners' non-wage income to support universal home care, which states 3.8 percent. Does this bill collect a total of company tax 1.9 percent and an additional 3.8 percent from a second level?"
Mark Eves: "Yes. As speaker of the House, giving Maine's seniors the freedom to age where and how they wanted was one of my top priorities. That's why I worked across the aisle to pass a $15 million senior housing bond that still languishes on the governor's desk. This referendum is a good next step and would allow even more of Maine seniors to afford the care they need and age in place if they so choose."
Adam Cote: "I support the intent of the home care initiative and believe it is an attempt to deal with a very important challenge. I am still in dialogue with supporters of the initiative about questions I have on its implementation and possible impacts on professional standards for home care as drafted. As far as funding, my preference is to pay for initiatives through the existing state budget, smart bonding, or by growing our existing progressive tax base by helping more people and businesses succeed and grow in Maine versus raising tax rates."
Diane Russell: "Yes, we must find a rational way to pay for quality home health care for our elderly and disabled residents. Currently, they are some of the lowest-paid employees in the state which means lower quality of care for our most vulnerable."
Mark Dion: "Yes. More and more Mainers are retiring from lifetimes of hard work only to find themselves alone and isolated in their homes without the kind of support and care that they need to sustain healthy lives. Without more resources, this shortage of services for seniors and the disabled will only get worse."
Is it class warfare?
Opponents of higher tax rates for households with higher income call it class warfare. Why would or wouldn't that be the case with this ballot question?
Mark Dion: "It's not 'class warfare' to expect Maine's wealthier residents to pay their fair share. Under LePage, taxes for the wealthy have been cut repeatedly. It's time now to reconsider whether Maine's tax system is doing its job -- raising adequate revenues, and doing so as efficiently and fairly as possible."
Betsy Sweet: "The class warfare that exists now is the attacks on the middle class. They are continually squeezed as we make our tax code more and more regressive through the LePage tax cuts for our wealthiest residents. Everyone should have to pay their fair share and that is why I support making our tax code more progressive."
Janet Mills: "'Class warfare' and other terms like it are poll-tested turns of phrase generated by expensive consultants to polarize the debate and keep people fighting each other. To address the real issues facing Maine -- ensuring our state has affordable health care, good jobs, clean air and water, and great schools -- we need to bring people to the table and work together. That's what I'll do as governor."
Donna Dion: "This is similar to the 7.65 percent taxes paid currently by employers for all levels of wages, and 15.3 percent from self-employed workers. If this is the concept, my interpretation is correct. The state of Maine is placing an increased tax to employers of 1.9 percent and having an additional amount collected from the employee earning over $127,200 another 1.9 percent for a total of 3.8 percent."
Mark Eves: "LePage pushed a tax cut for the wealthy with every budget, including another one this year. That's on top of the giveaway that the wealthy got from President Trump. It's time our tax code -- and our budget -- started tilting more toward the needs of working families. This referendum is a step in the right direction."
Adam Cote: "After seven-plus years under the 'opponents' economic leadership, Maine is lagging New England and the country when it comes to job, income, and economic growth. The question is why do all the Republicans running for governor profess to want to 'stay the course' on an approach that cut revenue sharing, underfunded the state contribution to local schools, and drove local property taxes up on Maine people, especially in rural areas? That is class warfare."
Diane Russell: "It's time the rich pay their fair share."
Tax code changes
What changes, if any, would you propose to Maine's tax code as governor?
Diane Russell: "I plan to close the offshore tax loophole which would bring in $10 million more per year, and channel that money toward closing the food insecurity gap and ending hunger by 2020. We would invest money in our local farms to ensure quality, nutritious food is available and deployed to families who need it -- all while ensuring corporations currently hiding their money on offshore bank accounts will foot the bill."
Mark Dion: "The LePage tax cuts, and the new tax cuts from Congress, mean that a greater burden is shifted to lower-income families, and, in Maine, to local governments. The state does need to raise more revenue, not only to help the elderly and disabled, but to fund basic programs like property tax relief through revenue sharing and school funding. I will consider all existing taxes, including sales, income and business taxes, in funding the services Mainers believe are essential."
Betsy Sweet: "I would eliminate the numerous sales tax exemptions for businesses, especially those in tourism and entertainment, and would drastically cut the corporate welfare that is handed out with no accountability. I would also repeal the LePage tax cuts for the wealthiest and implement a 3 percent surcharge on our highest income earners that was enacted by the people to pay for education. I would also expand the circuit breaking program to provide property tax relief and the earned income tax credit."
Janet Mills: "We need to address the simple fact that LePage's much-touted tax cuts largely shifted the the burden onto local communities and property taxes, which are now driving seniors out of their homes. I support restoring revenue sharing, fully funding the state's education obligations, and expanding the homestead exemption, all of which would lessen the burden on homeowners."
Donna Dion: "More transparency of the tax impact and make the poverty level for one person $12,400 per year and that would be a benefit of $23.56 per year or 45 cents per week to have the benefit. We would have a more self-sufficient program if 100 percent participation instead of just the top 6 percent of wage earners. If we are developing cost-effective programs to keep individuals in their homes, they should equally share the burden."
Mark Eves: "First we need to broaden the sales tax base. That's something most Mainers can agree on. Then we need to make the wealthy pay their share through a more progressive income tax. Finally we need to restore revenue sharing so that local communities can provide targeted property tax relief where it's affordable."
Adam Cote: "Taxes and budgets are about your values. As governor and as a kid who grew up in a family of public school teachers and welders, my goal is to turn an economy that lags New England and the country on job, income, and economic growth into an economy that works for all Mainers in every part of our state. My plan is to fund key initiatives (clean energy, infrastructure, workforce skills) that will drive growth, grow state revenues, and then prioritize tax incentives and other policies that help women, families, small businesses, and working Mainers succeed."

Texto completo: DEDHAM — A young Lowell woman lured 19-year-old Reina Rodriguez into prostitution with the promise of money, but later conspired with two men to rob her at a Braintree hotel, in a scheme that resulted in Rodriguez's death, prosecutors said Monday.
Assistant Norfolk District Attorney Lisa Beatty laid out the chilling allegations during the arraignment of Juana Rivera, 19, in Norfolk Superior Court on murder and other charges stemming from the death of Rodriguez. She was found naked from the waist up with her hands and legs bound by cellphone cords on June 22, 2017 inside a Hyatt Place Hotel room in Braintree, according to prosecutors.
Rodriguez's mother, Sigryd Garcia, told reporters after the hearing that she hopes Rivera lives “a miserable life" behind bars for her alleged role in the murder.
“She took the life of my daughter," an emotional Garcia said.
She added that her daughter had “a very good heart. She was a beautiful girl."
Beatty said Rivera initially promised to show Rodriguez, a former Lawrence resident who was homeless, how to make “a lot of money" through prostitution.
But “significant animosity and conflict" developed between the two, and Rivera allegedly hatched a plan with two codefendants, Kentavious Coleman and Kenyonte Galmore, to rob Rivera inside the hotel room on the night of her death.
A statement of the case filed by prosecutors said Rivera became angry when Jason McLeod, an alleged pimp who took proceeds from Rodriguez's sex work and who previously had a relationship with Rivera, began a relationship with Rodriguez.
On the day of the murder, Rivera, posing as a client, set up a meeting with Rodriguez via text message and passed along Rodriguez's room number to Galmore, the filing said.
A witness identified only as J.J. told a grand jury that after the killing, Rivera confronted Coleman and Galmore, who claimed that “the victim struggled so they had to smother her until she died," the document said.
The medical examiner determined that Rodriguez died from “homicidal asphyxia," according to the filing.
Prosecutors said Galmore's DNA profile was found on a cellphone cord that bound Rodriguez's legs, in a red-brown stain on the bed, and in Rodriguez's finger nail clippings.
Galmore and Coleman are in custody in Mississippi and will be brought back to Massachusetts to face murder charges in the slaying, prosecutors said.
Hotel surveillance footage showed Coleman entering the lobby with Galmore before the murder, and a hotel clerk saw them leave the lobby separately, according to prosecutors.
McLeod was arrested Friday in Maine and faces human trafficking charges in connection with the case, officials said.
“Defendant McLeod told investigators that the first person he thought could be responsible [for the killing] was Defendant Rivera," the filing said. “He said he called Defendant Rivera soon after finding the victim and told her, 'they killed my girl.' "
Rivera was handcuffed and wore a beige shirt and pink pants as she pleaded not guilty to all charges. She was ordered held without bail and her next hearing is scheduled for May 10.
She briefly shut her eyes as the clerk read out the charges but showed no obvious signs of emotion.
Her attorney for the arraignment, John Amabile, did not address the allegations in court.
Rodriguez's older sister, Sigryd Rachad, also attended the arraignment and fought tears as she spoke to reporters afterward.
“She didn't get away with this," Garcia said of Rivera. “Justice comes to everyone, what goes around comes around. . . . [Rodriguez] was my best friend, but I know she's OK now."
Marcos Rodriguez, the father of Reina Rodriguez, also became visibly upset as he discussed the case. His daughter, he said, loved horseback riding and roller skating.
He said she was “hanging out with the wrong" crowd at the time of her death.
“She was very caring," Marcos Rodriguez said. “That's all I can say right now."

NORRIDGEWOCK, Maine - A man accused of killing a sheriff's deputy was held in the state's maximum-security prison on Sunday pending his initial court appearance.
John Williams was transferred to the Maine State Prison in Warren after his arrest on Saturday, the fourth day of a massive manhunt in the central part of the state.
Williams, who's expected in court today or Tuesday, is accused of killing Somerset County Cpl. Eugene Cole, 61, early Wednesday.
Helicopters, tactical vehicles and rifle-toting law enforcement officers poured into the region, putting residents on edge, but that gave way to relief when Williams was taken into custody outside a remote cabin.
Shirtless and shoeless when captured, Williams, 29, appeared to be exhausted when he was led out of the woods.
Cole's brother, Tom Cole, said people were honking their car horns as they drove by his house on Saturday.
"The whole town was celebrating with me," he told WMTW-TV.
During the manhunt, area residents were discouraged from holding any sort of public memorial because law enforcement didn't want any mass gatherings.
Tom Cole said the grieving for his brother can start now that Williams is in custody. Eugene Cole's funeral will be May 7 at the Cross Insurance Center in Bangor.
Williams couldn't be reached for comment while in custody, and it was unknown if he had a lawyer who could comment for him. A lawyer likely will be appointed for him at his initial court appearance.
Williams' family members also couldn't be reached for comment.
Burning Man co-founder dies
SAN FRANCISCO - Larry Harvey, whose whimsical decision to erect a giant wooden figure and then burn it to the ground led to the popular, long-running counterculture celebration known as "Burning Man," has died. He was 70.
Harvey died Saturday morning at a hospital in San Francisco, surrounded by family, Burning Man Project CEO Marian Goodell said. The cause was not immediately known but he suffered a stroke earlier this month.
Burning Man takes place annually the week before Labor Day in Northern Nevada's Black Rock Desert. The weeklong festival attracts some 70,000 people who pay anywhere from $425 to $1,200 a ticket to travel to a dry lake bed 100 miles east of Reno.
There they must carry in their own food, build their own makeshift community and engage in whatever interests them. On the gathering's penultimate day, the giant effigy - or Man as it is known - is set ablaze during a raucous, joyful celebration.
An "esoteric mix of pagan fire ritual and sci-fi Dada circus where some paint their bodies, bang drums, dance naked and wear costumes that would draw stares in a Mardi Gras parade," is how the Associated Press once described the gathering.
While tickets now sell out immediately, Harvey described in a 2007 interview how he had much more modest intentions when he launched Burning Man on San Francisco's Baker Beach one summer day in 1986.
"I called a friend and said, 'Let's go to the beach and burn a man,'" he told the website Green Living. "And he said, 'Can you say that again?' And I did and we did it."
Within a few years the event had outgrown Baker Beach and moved to the desert.
Burning Man flourished as Harvey meticulously oversaw its every detail from the various communities that would spring up overnight to its annual arts theme to the beautifully crafted temple that accompanies Burning Man and is also burned.
Harvey eventually formed a limited liability corporation to put on Burning Man, converting it in 2013 to a nonprofit with 70 employees and a budget of $30 million. He was president of its board and "chief philosophic officer."
Harvey had a falling-out with John Law, who had co-founded Burning Man with him and who sued to have its trademark placed in the public domain. They settled out of court and Harvey retained control.
"We don't use the trademark to market anything. It's our identity," said Harvey, who often spoke against the commodification of popular culture.
He is survived by his son, Tristan Harvey, and brother, Stewart Harvey.

While college may cause headaches for some, Middlesex Communit College helped her on the road to recovery

Texto completo: Adriana Guy's firsthand experience with doctors and nurses in high school helped her select a career path. The Middlesex Community College student expects to graduate in May with a degree in Medical Assisting.

During her freshman year of high school, the 21-year-old Lowell resident was diagnosed with vestibular migraines, a nervous-system disorder that causes severe headaches and dizziness.

"I felt like I was on the fastest spinning ride, nonstop," Guy said. "I also had pseudo-seizures and developed severe anxiety."

The illness left her unable to attend high school. At first, Guy was home-tutored, but she was failing her courses. Then, during her junior year, she enrolled in an online high school and things began to turn around.

She improved her grades and graduated sooner than her high-school peers. This spring, after graduating from MCC, she plans to work as a medical assistant before continuing her education to become a pediatric nurse.

"During the time of my illness, I was in and out of various doctors' offices and hospitals," said Guy, who now manages her illness through medication. "I remember the staff, the medical assistants and nurses who made me feel better, and I want to be able to help someone that way, too."

Her path to MCC was well-thought out, also.

"I chose Middlesex because I wanted to start classes slowly while dealing with my illness," Guy said. "Also, since I had been enrolled in an online high school, I didn't want to jump right into a four-year school. MCC seemed to have the right path for me to become comfortable with college."

But Guy got more than comfortable She jumped right into extracurricular activities, joining clubs and looking for leadership opportunities.

"I love the community here at MCC, the resources available for students, the clubs and activities, and the overall support the college offers," she said. "Middlesex changed my life in many ways. I didn't think I would be successful in college, but MCC helped prove me wrong."

Guy is currently president of the Medical Assisting Club and is a past member of the Middlesex Activities Crew, and the Multicultural Achievement Peer Program.

The highlight of her college experience so far was attending the annual Diversity Summit, a multiday, off-campus experience held in Maine.

"I felt like I learned a lot more about myself and others at the summit," she said. "When I came back, I felt like a new person, more open to be myself."

Over the past few years, Guy has faced obstacles that might have broken many other young people. Instead, she's proud to have persevered -- even when she wanted to give up -- and has used those obstacles to push harder toward her goals.

"I learned that no matter what challenges you face, there is always a chance to conquer them," she said.

Texto completo: Another quarterback switch couldnt stop the Jacksonville Sharks slump from taking a steeper turn for the worse.Adrian McPherson made his first start behind center for the Sharks, but Tyrone Laughinghouse, Charles McCullum and the Carolina Cobras overwhelmed Jacksonville 55-21 Saturday at Veterans Memorial Arena.Carolina (3-1) blew the game open in a four-minute span in the fourth quarter, with Laughinghouse receiving two of his five touchdowns and Cobras lineman Toni Pulu returning a McPherson interception for another score, igniting a run of 32 unanswered points.Its a game of runs, man, Sharks receiver Chris Gilchrist said. They made a few runs, and we were trying to play catch-up.The loss was the Sharks heaviest at home since going down 62-27 to the Arena Football Leagues Philadelphia Soul on June 16, 2012.Not even three first-half takeaways on defense could keep the Sharks (1-3) from their third consecutive loss, their worst skid since joining the National Arena League in 2016.If the Sharks expected the 34-year-old McPherson to instantly turn around their sagging season, theyre going to have to wait a bit longer.The night started badly for the former Florida State quarterback, returning to the indoor game after nearly two years away from the field, and didnt get much better.He was sacked on his first snap and intercepted on his second, was downed behind the line five times, delivered a severely underthrown pass directly to Carolinas Pulu for a fourth-quarter pick-six and was briefly benched before halftime in favor of former Jacksonville University quarterback Ryan Walker.Aside from a 30-yard touchdown delivery from McPherson to Tom Gilson, which brought Jacksonville within 23-21 in the third quarter, the Sharks showed little cohesion on offense.The offenses woes were matched by a secondary that repeatedly lost track of Laughinghouse, who caught four touchdowns from Cobras quarterback McCullum and also scored a kickoff return.The Sharks, now fifth in the six-team NAL, next travel Saturday to the Maine Mammoths.

Texto completo: Susan Northrup Huber Gross of West Hartford, died peacefully at her home on April 27, 2018 surrounded by her loving family and four legged family members. She is survived by her loving husband, Howard I. Gross of 51 years, her loving daughters, Mindy Ottmann of Farmington, Wendy Wassell and her spouse Mark Resnisky of Farmington, her loving granddaughter Jennifer Ottmann and her finance Tim Therian, Jr. of Windsor. Her step daughters Margaret Howard of Richmond, VT, Stephanie Gross of New York City, her step granddaughter April Howard, her step grandson Elias Howard, her step great grandchildren, Leon and Eulalie Summers.
Born August 20, 1933 in West Hartford, to Thomas and Eva Dorothy (Yost) Huber. She was a child piano prodigy blessed with absolute pitch. She performed in numerous recitals and with her favorite duo-pianist, Rial Ogden and with the Hartford Symphony. She attended the Fernwood School until she was old enough to be enrolled at Oxford School which she attended to the ninth grade when she left to benefit from the boarding school experience at Mary Burnham School in North Hampton, MA, where she blossomed. Her formal education ended at Bennett College from which she graduated in 1953. Her association with instructions of higher learning was extensive; as a guest of numerous beaus she visited almost every college in the eastern U.S., especially Princeton where her brother Charles F. Huber II was a student in the mold of F. Scott Fitzgerald, who could have taken celebratory instruction from the Huber family.
Susan was an avid fisherman, a love which she developed during the summers spent at her Grandfather's Maine estate, Huber Camp, on Belgrade Lake with her parents and her beloved Uncle Paul Huber, a noted Broadway and radio actor. Her love of fishing was enhanced after her marriage to her husband, Howard, and the two of them spent many wonderful days on the waters at Belgrade and fishing the Niagara River, with Susan landing a 42 pound, all-time Huber champion salmon. A tennis player of note, she was coached by Eddie Reid at Hartford Golf Club from the time of her youth and played in many tournaments in the Northeast. She and Howard loved to travel Europe with crossings on the Queen Elizabeth and the Concorde. No shrinking violet she, her adventurousness is illustrated by her eighth day hot air ballooning journey through the Loire Valley in France with Howard.
Second to her family was her love of entertaining at her West Hartford home with elaborate and imaginative pool and dinner parties, enlivened by musicians from far and near including one memorable evening at which the noted recording artist Barry Harris and his quartet performed for her guests.
A lifelong member of the Hartford Golf Club, she was also a former member of the Country Club of Farmington, the Junior League (Chairman of the Clothes Horse committee), Town and Country Club, Society of Mayflower Descendants and Daughters of American Revolution.
Susan firmly believed that Heaven was where you were greeted by all the dogs you ever loved, and she would appreciate your contributions in her memory to an animal rescue organization of your choice. Private Funeral arrangements are in care of Taylor and Modeen in West Hartford. A memorial service and reception will be held in the future.
This is a paid death notice.

Texto completo: Sarbanes: Take big money out of elections
Kudos to Baltimore for taking an important step toward citizen-owned elections ("Baltimore City Council to consider public financing of city elections," April 23). This kind of system would put Baltimore among the vanguard of cities and states - including Maryland's own Montgomery and Howard Counties - that are leading the fight against big money in politics.
Around the country, we've seen the positive effect of citizen-owned elections. In places like Seattle, Connecticut, Maine, Arizona and New York City, people are reducing the corrosive influence of wealthy special interests and taking charge of their democracy. Citizen-owned elections are empowering everyday voters, giving them a greater voice in government and encouraging them to engage in the political process. Citizen-owned elections are also diversifying and expanding the candidate pool by enabling more people - not only those with access to large sums of money - to run for office and win.
Importantly, the success of these small-donor systems is helping build momentum for federal reforms like The Government By the People Act, a bill I've authored to create a citizen-owned elections system for Congressional candidates. This bold reform proposal would diminish special-interest influence and make Congress more receptive to the issues that people care about like gun safety, protecting our environment and lowering prescription drug prices. By pointing to places across America where clean elections have made a meaningful and constructive impact, we can create more energy and enthusiasm for national reform.
The citizen-owned elections system proposed in the City Council presents Baltimore with an opportunity to join a growing national movement to reform our politics. If we can build a democracy of the many, not the money, we can return to a government of, by and for the people.

Corner stores aren't driving crime numbers
If you ever wondered why Mayor Catherine Pugh and Baltimore City Police Department officials can't come up with an effective crime reduction strategy, you only need to consider the underlying logic of the Mayor Pugh's criticism of the corner stores in our poorest neighborhoods ("Pugh's war on corner stores," April 25). The mayor relies on studies that show a "connection" between the over-concentration of corner stores and violent crime. But she confuses correlation with causation, and this could lead to more futile crime fighting policies. The stores aren't the problem, the repeat violent offenders are the root cause of the skyrocketing crime rate (as Sen. Bobby Zirkin observed in his April 25 commentary, "State Senate's new violent repeat offender law"). If you closed every corner store, would the open air drug markets disappear? Would retaliatory murders cease?
The bad news is Mayor Pugh diverting her efforts to peripheral crime theories. The good news is that since criminals cluster around corner stores, it should be easier to round up these thugs and get them off the streets. Of course, as mayor, she would have to re-empower the patrolmen and women, demand aggressive prosecution and push hard for judicial reform so that repeat violent offenders can anticipate, with certainty, a long prison stay.
Joseph Migliara, Owings Mills
Cyclist's outrageous attack on Roland Park
Liz Cornish is paid to advocate for cyclists as executive director of Bikemore, not attack neighborhoods like Roland Park ("Baltimore needs a citywide approach to street design," April 24). Her tactics have crossed a line in a commentary that should never have been published.
There is no racism or equity issue connected to the need for a redesign of Roland Avenue, rather the safety of all is what's at stake. Neighbors here asked for a Complete Street but were given an incomplete one and now demand the city correct their mistake. If Ms. Cornish truly wanted safety for all, she'd be working with us.
M.K. Battafarano, Baltimore
Why no love for Gilman track?
I know The Baltimore Sun's sports desk is in love with the McDonogh girls lacrosse team, and 200 wins in a row is very impressive ("Girls lacrosse Game of the Week: No. 2 Notre Dame Prep at No. 1 McDonogh," April 26), but your varsity sports section has been leaving out a team even more dominant - the Gilman track team.
So far this year they have won every event, and usually by 80 to 90 points (average scores this year have been on the order of 112-to-30). That's not just dominance. There are no other schools in the area that even come close. Why no love for the track program ("2017-2018 All-Metro boys indoor track and field Coach of the Year: Matt Tully, Gilman," April 10)?

Hit-and-run deaths up 60% in 2016

Texto completo: Hit and run fatalities increased 60 percent from 2009 to 2016, according to a study of national data, resulting in more than 2,000 deaths in 2016.
Nearly 65 percent of people killed in hit-and-run crashes were pedestrians or bicyclists, according to the study by the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety. In the last 10 years, 20 percent of all pedestrian deaths were caused in hit-and-run crashes, compared to 1 percent of driver fatalities.
"Hit-and-run crashes in the United States are trending in the wrong direction," said Dr. David Yang, executive director of the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety. "Our analysis shows that hit-and-run crashes are a growing traffic safety challenge, and the AAA Foundation would like to work with all stakeholders to help curtain this problem."
Every state has laws that make it a crime to flee an accident. In South Dakota, state law requires motorists in accidents to remain on the scene, provide information to authorities and to render aid. Leaving the scene of an injury or fatality accident is a class-6 felony.
"It is every driver's legal and moral responsibility to take necessary precautions to avoid hitting a pedestrian, bicyclist or another vehicle," said Marilyn Buskohl, spokeswoman for AAA South Dakota. "While no one likes being involved in a crash, leaving the scene will significantly increase the penalties for drivers, whether they caused the crash or not."
New Mexico, Louisiana and Florida had the highest per-capita rates of fatal hit-and-run accidents while New Hampshire, Maine and Minnesota had the lowest rates.

Texto completo: Next month will mark the 40th anniversary of a tragedy, its memory eroded by time. On May 18, 1978, an Austin police officer was murdered, shot 10 times during a routine traffic stop by a University of Texas honors student-turned-drug dealer.
It was my first week in the newspaper business. A callow teenage obituary clerk at the Austin paper, I watched the sleepy newsroom jolted into action. I saw shock on the faces of veteran reporters, some of whom had covered the 1966 tower shootings on the UT campus.
The murder of a cop was one of the few things that could still rattle them -- the same way it rattles me today, decades later. The way it rattles all of us, entire communities, every time it happens.
Dallas patrolman Rogelio Santander, shot Tuesday by a shoplifting suspect, was not the first U.S. police officer murdered this month. He wasn't even the only one to die this week: Just a few hours before Santander died, a 62-year-old sheriff's deputy in rural Maine was shot to death by a suspect who stole his police cruiser.
"Few events are more psychologically destabilizing to a police agency than the death of one of their own in the line of duty," according to a study published in the International Journal of Emergency Mental Health.
I can think of no more descriptive term than "destabilization" to characterize the disorienting shock that gripped this region following the sniper attack summer before last that killed five of our officers and injured nine others.
But the murder of a police officer -- like the murder of a child -- still leaves us shaken, destabilized. There's a reason both of these are capital crimes in the state of Texas.
In the case of children, we're heartbroken by their innocence. When it's cops, we're unsettled because we're temporarily reminded of their willingness to accept risks that most of us would not.
Every day, they deal with people and situations most of us would take a long detour to avoid.
If I live to be a hundred, I will not forget the name of that Austin police officer who died the week I joined the news business.
His name was Ralph Ablanedo. He was 26 years old, with a young wife and two little boys. He was murdered during a traffic stop by a man who mowed him down with an AK-47 assault rifle.
There's a short street in South Austin named Ralph Ablanedo Boulevard, but you likely have to be of a certain age to remember why.
That, or you have to be a cop. They remember him -- the same way they'll remember Rogelio Santander.

Texto completo: We love our national parks. But the problem is, we love them too much. The value of good administration and stewardship for our parks has become overwhelmed and the backlog of maintenance needs for our parks has climbed to a whopping $11.6 billion as of fiscal year 2017. Whether it is Crater Lake in Oregon or Yellowstone spanning across Idaho, Wyoming and Montana, our parks need our help.
Last fiscal year, the National Park Service's entire congressional appropriation was a mere $2.9 billion. With four times that in the existing backlog, the math doesn't add up. Combined with visitation pressures, costs that increase the longer that repairs are delayed, and decades old facilities and infrastructure — it's difficult to keep pace with needs much less get ahead of them. Under the status quo, the backlog will only continue to grow.
That is why, along with senators Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., and Angus King, I-Maine, as well as Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, we have proposed a bipartisan, House-Senate solution to bring that backlog down and help our national parks.
Simply put, our National Park Restoration Act will redirect unused revenues from a variety of energy sources on federal lands into a new fund called the National Park Restoration Fund. This fund will then be used to bring down the maintenance backlog throughout our parks, restoring trails, roads, campgrounds and water systems for generations to come.
Using energy revenues for conservation priorities is nothing new. This is the same revenue source that has been used for decades for the Land and Water Conservation Fund with bipartisan support. Our bill does nothing to require, incentivize or change any aspect of energy production across our federal lands. And it does nothing to take away funds from the LWCF. In fact, our bill actually expands the revenue sources to include renewables like solar, wind and hydropower.
Energy revenues have been used for years to pay for protecting our public lands. Now we need to use these same funds to restore and rebuild them.
The legislative process can be long and should be filled with debate. Throughout that process, we welcome and encourage input from national park advocates. It is why we sought to offer a solution in the first place. We also thank the current supporters of the bill from the conservation, business, and outdoor communities. We can all agree that there is a dire need to take care of our public lands.
Former president Franklin D. Roosevelt once said that "there is nothing so American as our national parks." Let's work together to rebuild and restore our parks to the condition they ought to be — the crown jewels of our great nation.

Texto completo: Jamil Demby is going to get an opportunity to play in the National Football League.
The Vineland native was selected by the Los Angeles Rams in the sixth round (192nd overall pick) of the NFL Draft on Saturday.
"Words can't describe what I'm feeling right now, I'm just so blessed," Demby said. "I want to show everyone in Vineland and the youth of the city that dreams really do come true. I can't wait to get started."
Demby was part of a watch party for the NFL Draft at the Double Eagle in East Vineland when his cell phone rang around 4:30 p.m..
"It was a California number, so I knew something might be happening," Demby said. "The GM (Les Snead) was on the other end and asked me 'Are you ready to be a Ram?'. I said, 'Yes, sir.' and he introduced me to the head coach Sean McVay."
Demby, a 6-foot-5, 335-pound offensive line, was a four-year starter at the University of Maine and saw his draft stock soar after competing in the NFLPA Collegiate Bowl and Senior Bowl along with the NFL Scouting Combine.
Prior to the NFL Draft, Demby worked out for eight teams including a trip to Los Angeles to meet with the Rams. He's familiar with L.A., where he practiced before NFLPA Collegiate Bowl, and said he also has family in the area.
"It's beautiful out there," Demby said.
The lineman said he will be flying out to Los Angeles to join the team for rookie mini camp in a couple weeks.
Demby didn't have any big plans to celebrate the history-making event Saturday night.
"I'm just going to kick back with some of the people who were influential for me getting to this point," Demby said.
Vineland High School football coach Dan Russo, who helped organize the watch party, said that Demby was emotional when the selection was made around 4:30 p.m.
"Lots of tears, lots of joy for the Demby family," Russo said. "It's a great day for the family. it's a great day for Vineland. It was crazy here. The whole town came out to cheer for him. It was great."
Demby started 40 games at left tackle at Maine, but projects more as a guard in the pros according to scouting reports.
Demby is the first-ever player from Vineland to be selected in the NFL Draft and aims to be just the second to ever to play in the NFL. Lou Piccone, who went undrafted out of West Liberty State, played with the New York Jets and Buffalo Bills from 1974-1982.
"I told him they've been playing football in Vineland since 1895 and there's only been one player to play in the NFL, he's going to be No. 2," Russo said. "To see him go in the draft, it's just a great feeling. There's a lot of pressure about being drafted, but I knew he was going to get a chance to play in the NFL."

Texto completo: MIDDLEBROOK - It's up a long driveway, so you can't see the home from the road. Surrounded by towering pine trees where the mountains peek out slightly, it's the seclusion that both Beverly and Pete Frank wanted.
Built in 1996, the Franks have a total of 38 acres to stretch out on and Folly Mills Creek runs through the property.
"It's peaceful," Beverly Frank said. "Everyone who comes up here says it's peaceful."
Part of the 85th Annual Staunton and Augusta County House and Garden Tour that took place on April 21, the Frank's home on Sleepy Hollow Road is one of four homes on the tour. This year, the tour focused on homes and farms in Middlebrook.
The home serves as a midway point for Pete Frank, Beverly said.
As a defense contractor, Pete designs furniture for the U.S. Navy, Coast Guard and ferryboats. Middlebrook was the midway point between Maine and Louisiana — where all the ship building was going on.
The old Hopeman Brothers used to be his biggest customer, Beverly said.
Although they built their 5 bedroom and 3 and half bathroom home in the 1990s, they've called the Staunton area home since the 1980s.
"We built the house with the idea of having a large number of people," she said. "It has a nice flow in here. We've had 60 people in here before for dinners. But it was built to be comfortable, because it's not a formal house. It can be whatever you want, truthfully. You can make if formal, but we don't think it's formal.
"I think it's just a large, comfortable home with a peaceful setting and a pastoral view," she added.
The view also comes with horses — the couple own Norwegian Fjord ponies who gallop past the bottom of the hill that the home sits on.
The Franks raised their three daughters in the home, having their youngest daughter spending the most time there.
"It was great, it was wonderful," Beverly said.
The home was always filled with music and art. The walls are covered in artwork, showcasing many local artists including Mary Ann Vessey (who's home is also featured on the tour), Anita Cooper and Laura Gilliland along with Columbian artist Kay Rodriguez.
They own a 1859 Steinway and Sons piano in the front room, part of their music room. Beverly studied music in college — voice and piano, but also learned the cello and plays in the Waynesboro Symphony.
The home also features a large recreation room, which used to be an indoor pool.
It's a large home, but it feels cozy. You can feel the warmth of it as you enter the door. The exterior of the home is finely manicured featuring various trees and perennial beds. Plus, a great mountain view from a set of Adirondack chairs.
Her favorite part of the home is the gazebo that sits just down from the front door.
"It's just relaxing and peaceful," she said.
They like to just sit out there and unwind when the weather is nice.
"We do that a lot, sitting in the swing," she said. "It's very relaxing."

Push would raise age for cigarette sales

Texto completo: One day soon, if local health advocates get their way, the age to buy cigarettes, vaporizers or other tobacco products will rise to 21 in Cincinnati.
Making tobacco a little harder for young adults to buy could go a long way to improving Greater Cincinnati's overall health, the advocates say. Setting the purchase age at 21, they say, can save lives by bringing down the infant mortality rate, reducing the risk of cancer and improving heart health.
"We hope this is a unifying policy," said Jeff Gaylor, senior director of community health for the local affiliate of the American Heart Association. "This is such a widespread issue that we think it's unifying for the city."
Columbus, Cleveland and eight other Ohio cities have already raised the tobacco-purchase age to 21: Akron, the Cleveland suburb of Euclid, and the Columbus ring cities of Bexley, Dublin, Grandview Heights, New Albany, Powell and Upper Arlington. Nationally, Hawaii, California, New Jersey and Oregon have raised the purchase age statewide, and Maine follows suit in July.
Gaylor said the Cincinnati ordinance would not criminalize possession of tobacco.
Retailers across the state who sell tobacco products are not thrilled by such changes in the law, said Alex Boehnke, manager of public affairs for the Ohio Council of Retail Merchants. Chiefly, business owners don't appreciate the additional training or fees that come along with a new ordinance. "It's more the patchwork of regulation that is a concern for us, more than it being specifically about tobacco."
Any such ordinance would have to come before City Council for consideration, and nothing has been scheduled yet. Gaylor and other advocates say they want to build more community support first — but the effort got a boost April 24 when the city's Board of Health unanimously voted to support a city ordinance to raise the tobacco-buying age to 21.
An ordinance would cover all tobacco products including e-cigarettes and vaporizers.
Raising the purchasing age can reduce racial and ethnic differences in tobacco use, since young adults of color, particularly African-Americans, are more likely to start smoking at 18, 19 and 20. Plus, older teenagers also are frequently the suppliers of tobacco for underage friends.
The Institute of Medicine has found that raising the purchasing age for tobacco to 21 will cut the number of 15- to 17-year-olds who start smoking. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that every day, more than 3,200 people under 18 smoke their first cigarettes.
Tobacco use is the single most important risk factor for developing cancer and heart disease. The Institute of Medicine also has reported that if the purchasing age were raised nationwide to 21, there would be nearly a quarter of a million fewer premature deaths caused by tobacco use and 50,000 fewer deaths from lung cancer.
The national smoking rate is 15.1 percent, the CDC says. The private nonprofit America's Health Rankings database reveals that Ohio's smoking rate is 22.5 percent, and Hamilton County's rate is 18 percent.
The Heart Association has teamed to push for the local ordinance with the local chapters of the American Lung Association and the American Cancer Society, the health education nonprofits Interact for Health and the Health Collaborative, the Cincinnati Health Department, Hamilton County Public Health, the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids and Cradle Cincinnati, the nonprofit fighting the county's high rate of baby death.
Ten Ohio cities have already enacted ordinances that raise the legal age to purchase tobacco products to 21. Local health advocates are pushing to make Cincinnati the next one.

Suspect in Deputy's
Killing Is Behind Bars
A man accused of killing a sheriff's deputy was being held in the state's maximum-security prison on Sunday, officials said.
John Williams was transferred to the Maine State Prison after his arrest on Saturday, the fourth day of a massive manhunt.
Mr. Williams, who is expected in court early this week, is accused of killing Somerset County Cpl. Eugene Cole, 61 years old, on Wednesday after the two had an encounter on a darkened road in Norridgewock.
Mr. Williams, 29, was shirtless and shoeless when captured outside a remote cabin in the woods.
Mr. Cole's brother, Tom Cole, said people were honking their car horns as they drove by his house. "The whole town was celebrating with me," he told WMTW-TV.
Mr. Cole said the grieving for his brother can start now that Mr. Williams is in custody. Eugene Cole's funeral will be May 7.
Neither Mr. Williams nor a family member could be reached for comment, and it was unknown whether he had a lawyer.

Burning Man Festival
Co-Founder Dies
Larry Harvey, whose whimsical decision to erect a giant wooden figure and then burn it to the ground led to the popular, long-running counterculture celebration known as "Burning Man," has died.
Mr. Harvey, who was 70 years old, died Saturday at a San Francisco hospital, surrounded by family, said Burning Man Project CEO Marian Goodell. The cause wasn't immediately known, but Mr. Harvey suffered a stroke earlier this month.
Burning Man takes place annually the week before Labor Day in northern Nevada's Black Rock Desert. The weeklong festival attracts some 70,000 people who pay anywhere from $425 to $1,200 a ticket to travel to a dry lake bed 100 miles east of Reno. There they must carry in their own food, build a makeshift community and engage in whatever interests them. On the gathering's penultimate day, the giant effigy -- or Man as it is known -- is set ablaze during a raucous, joyful celebration.

Texto completo: Aging brings inevitable losses, the Rev. Constance Chandler-Ward said in an interview posted on a blog a couple of years ago, not long after she turned 80, though such experiences open other doors.
Her own life energy was “expanding my awareness of everything," she told blogger Pat Taub for the Women's Older Wisdom website. “I'm also aware of what's lost — not just friends and loved ones, but my memory. I have trouble with names. I see this as a gift in that it becomes an introduction to mystery, rather than knowing."
For those who live long enough to be old, Rev. Chandler-Ward added, “all that's left is mystery. The world is bigger. Boundaries disappear. Mystery is present when language and images fall away. Then one moves from looking at a particular thing to its essence."
On the afternoon of April 2, while driving along Route 1 in Warren, Maine, she apparently experienced heart difficulties, her family said. Rev. Chandler-Ward, who was 82, died after her car crossed into the path of an oncoming tractor-trailer, authorities told local newspapers.
She had moved to the village of Tenants Harbor, Maine, at the beginning of the 1990s, after serving for about a decade as chaplain of Wellesley College. With two other women who, like her, were Episcopal priests, Rev. Chandler-Ward opened and ran the nonprofit Greenfire retreat center for women.
“Greenfire came from our commitment to do deep, inner work in the context of circles of women, beginning with our own sisterhood circle and extending out to all with whom we met," the Rev. Judith Carpenter, a cofounder, said at a memorial service in Maine on April 21.
Rev. Chandler-Ward had the idea of “offering what we called 'Work-Visions,' in which three of us would meet with a woman for three sessions of two hours each," Carpenter added. “We would listen closely to her work-life questions and struggles, seeking to offer back to her what we were each hearing so that she could more clearly and deeply hear herself."
The collaborative nature of their spiritual work with women was much in keeping with Rev. Chandler-Ward's character. Arjo Klamer, who had been an assistant professor at Wellesley while she was chaplain, spoke at the service of “her shyness, her dislike of being photographed – oh gosh, how glad she must be that she does not have to be here. She hated to be the center of attention."
And yet “she had a wonderful way of interacting with people, especially one-on-one and in small circles," said her brother David Chandler of Ashfield, a former Globe science writer. “And I think many, many people through the years felt strongly influenced by those interactions."
Sarah Chandler-Ward of Haydenville said that when she thinks of her mother, “the words that come to mind are wisdom and grace. She was always a very solid, still presence for people."
In the Women's Older Wisdom interview, Rev. Chandler-Ward said she was “happy to pass along my life experiences, but without adding value to them," and added: “I don't want to carry the tag of 'elder.' It feels too judgmental — passing on wisdom I decide is important."
A poem she wrote included the lines: “Now I am old./Now a few of my coverings crumble."
The third of five siblings, Constance Chandler was born in Cambridge. Her mother, the former Ruth Doggett, was a civil rights activist in places including Selma, Ala., and Chicago. Her father, the Rev. Edgar Chandler, was a United Church of Christ minister who for a time directed refugee services in Geneva for the World Council of Churches.
With her sister and brothers, Connie Chandler grew up in Switzerland, where the family had “a diverse mix of people from all parts of the world — all languages, all cultures, all religions — around us all the time," David said.
She graduated from Trinity College in Dublin with a bachelor's degree and a master's, and went to Yale Divinity School, from which she graduated with a master's in divinity in 1961.
That same year she married David Ward, who graduated from Berkeley Divinity School, which also was in New Haven. They combined their last names.
David was ordained in 1965, before the Episcopal Church allowed women to serve as priests. He also was an actor, playwright, and poet. “They made an odd pair," Klamer said. “He sought the public attention that she was running away from."
When she was ordained in 1977 in Charlottesville, Va., Rev. Chandler-Ward told a local newspaper that allowing women to serve as priests was “a necessary and important movement in the Episcopal Church. The ministry must be performed by all people who feel called to it."
Though she was among the first women to be ordained, “the church never gave her a full rectorship anywhere," said her daughter, who noted that in her early years as a priest, Rev. Chandler-Ward mostly served “an assistant rector to my father" at St. Paul's Memorial Church in Charlottesville and Grace Episcopal Church in Providence.
Sarah added that in the 1980s, her mother “took it upon herself to rewrite" Episcopal liturgy, “to change the language so that it wasn't gender exclusive." In Rev. Chandler-Ward's rendering, “the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost became Creator, Christ, and Holy Spirit so that it conveyed the meaning without the gender," Sarah recalled.
Rev. David Chandler-Ward died of cancer in 1984 at age 52.
By then, Rev. Constance Chandler-Ward was the Wellesley College chaplain. In 1990, she delivered the invocation at the ceremony when then-first lady Barbara Bush delivered the commencement address.
“Help us, oh God, who is love itself, to love ourselves and our connection to each other beyond the limits of race, class, age, sexual preference, and culture, and guide us through the farewells and the completion of this cycle to approach with deep hope whatever is next for us," Rev. Chandler-Ward said that day.
What was next for her was Greenfire and a move to Tenants Harbor, where Suzanne Chambliss Neil became her longtime partner. Neil died in December 2013.
“For the first time in my life I'm alone, following the death of my partner two years ago," Rev. Chandler-Ward said in the Women's Older Wisdom interview. “I find the gift of living alone allows me to be undisturbed. Without the presence of another I am expanding in a new way. There is no one to reflect back to me, so a new aspect of my life is opening."
A service has been held for Rev. Chandler-Ward, who in addition to her daughter Sarah and brother David leaves her other daughter, Jennifer Chandler-Ward of Cambridge; a sister, Marjorie Chandler of Oxford, England; two other brothers, Hugh Chandler of Urbana, Ill., and Christopher Chandler of Chicago; and three grandchildren.
Rev. Chandler-Ward, participated in church choirs, played instruments, and performed with choral groups in Maine. A lifelong artist, she moved from medium to medium, painting in oils and acrylics and, in Maine, creating sculptures from sea glass and driftwood. She also made a prayer shawl that was used as the altar cloth at her memorial service.
In her poem about aging, she wrote:
Now I am old.
Now I have no use for protection.
I feel most of all what has been feared and refused.
From my heart's isolated chambers there flows ache and gratitude.
Together they melt into a strange love.

Failed N.J. casino will reopen with a new owner
Atlantic City's former Revel casino did plenty of things wrong in the two years it was open. Now the new owner says he's fixing them and plans to reopen the property as the Ocean Resort Casino. Colorado real estate developer Bruce Deifik said he plans to allow smoking, open a buffet, welcome bus tours, and reconfigure the casino floor to make it easier to move around. All those things were considered problems with the $2.4 billion Revel, which closed in 2014. Deifik bought it for $200 million in January and plans a summer opening. — ASSOCIATED PRESS
COMMODITIES
As demand for lithium surges, company boosts production
A little-known Chilean company that until recently churned out mostly crop nutrients may hold a key to the future of electric-vehicle production. And a Chinese mining company is poised to grab a big piece of it. Soc. Quimica & Minera de Chile sits on the world's richest deposit of lithium. It produces more than 20 percent of the global supply and is about to produce a lot more. SQM will at least double and could eventually quadruple lithium capacity, thanks to recent agreements between the company and the Chilean government. Ramping up production of the mineral will help meet seemingly insatiable demand from electric-car makers. The green light to mine vastly more lithium has put SQM in the sights of several mining companies, including London-based Rio Tinto Group and China's Tianqi Lithium Corp. "Tianqi owning the stake would be another step toward overall Chinese consolidation of the lithium industry," said Chris Berry, a New York-based energy-metals analyst. Christopher Perrella, a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst, said a Chinese move to control SQM makes sense. "The Chinese view electric vehicles as a key technological focus," he said. "Most of the world's batteries are made in China, and access to lithium would be of strategic interest." Lithium prices have reached historic highs on the strength of growing EV ­production. — BLOOMBERG NEWS
MERGERS
Largest warehouse owner gets even bigger with $8.4b deal
Prologis Inc. has agreed to acquire DCT Industrial Trust Inc. for $8.4 billion in stock and assumed debt, making the world's largest warehouse owner even bigger as demand surges in the age of online shopping. DCT stockholders will receive 1.02 Prologis shares for each of theirs, the companies said Sunday — a premium of about 16 percent over DCT's closing price of $58.75 on Friday. The boards of both San Francisco-based Prologis and Denver-based DCT approved the purchase, which is expected to be completed in the third quarter. DCT's 71 million square feet of real estate will help Prologis deepen the its presence in high-growth markets including Southern California, the San Francisco Bay area, Seattle, South Florida, and New York and New Jersey, according to the companies. — BLOOMBERG NEWS
FISHERIES
Feds will assess health of the Atlantic scallop fishery
Federal regulators are reviewing the health of sea scallops in the Atlantic Ocean to get a better handle on their status. Sea scallops are among the most valuable wild-harvested seafood products in the United States. They were worth more than $485 million at the docks in 2016, when fishermen harvested more than 40 million pounds of them. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration describes the assessment as a "scientifically rigorous review." It will help in the writing of future regulations for the sea scallop fishery. The agency says results of the assessment will be available in July. Sea scallops come to shore from Maine to Virginia. Massachusetts is the most productive state; in 2016, more than half of America's sea scallops came to land in Massachusetts. — ASSOCIATED PRESS
AIRLINES
Wow Air may seek funding as it ponders expanding, including with more US flights
The Icelandic carrier Wow Air, which offers low-cost trans-Atlantic flights via a hub in Reykjavik, may seek to raise funds this year by selling a stake in the company. Wow needs to finance expansion plans that include service to Asia and its first direct ­Europe-United States flights. It could seek a nonindustry investor or opt for an initial public offering of stock, founder and chief executive Skuli Mogensen said. He said that other airlines have shown an interest in Wow but declined to name them. Major carriers are sold on the concept of discounted long-distance travel, Mogensen said. Wow will announce its first Asian route from Iceland­ next month, with the aim of connecting­ travelers to the eastern seaboard of North America via the shortest Arctic flight path. Dublin and London remain options for a base for Wow's first direct US discount flights, while Wow is continuing­ to explore the possibility of establishing­ a “counter-seasonal" hub to which it could shift some of its aircraft during­ the Northern Hemisphere's winter, when demand ebbs, Mogensen said. — BLOOMBERG NEWS

Has Maine found a bipartisan solution to easing health care costs?

Texto completo: Might we ever see a bipartisan health care bill that addresses costs and receives unanimous legislative support? Although one emanating from Washington seems unlikely anytime soon, an innovative bipartisan health care bill — referred to as Right to Shop — unanimously passed the Maine Legislature in 2017 and merits a closer look.
Americans spend over $3 trillion a year on health care, with out-of-pocket costs to patients topping $353 billion in 2016. Yet the national debate on health care largely fails to tackle health care prices, including those increasingly paid by patients.
There is a growing concern that, without cost relief, individuals will struggle to maintain access to health care, and high costs will hurt employer hiring or their ability to afford the workers they have. This concern is hardly new. However, as federal reform has stalled, recent innovative actions in the states deserve more attention than they've received.
The Maine Right to Shop law begins by giving patients direct access to price information, enabling them to make informed decisions about costs of their care. It simultaneously incentivizes them to shop for high-quality, lower-cost providers by offering them financial rewards when they do so.
Maine's bill was developed by a local lawmaker who was fed up with the rising cost of coverage at his small, family-owned business. He borrowed from initiatives promoting transparency in at least three other states — Arizona, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire — and cleverly coupled these with cash (or other) incentives to encourage patients to shop. This combination has already shown promising results with state employees and at large companies, but until this legislation, it was largely nonexistent for those at small companies or buying insurance on their own.
But will this work to lower health spending? Some have questioned the effectiveness of price transparency, and others have reported mixed outcomes with transparency alone. But this shouldn't be surprising, because price transparency has rarely been coupled to meaningful incentives — like paying cash to patients who use high-value providers.
Today, most of us make online purchasing decisions to obtain savings of a few dollars. But remarkably, we remain indifferent to choices between care options whose prices differ by tens of thousands of dollars, despite numerous studies showing that higher health care prices do not correlate with better quality. Choosing the wrong provider might cost patients and the overall system more, with no improvement or even with lower quality care.
Until providers are incentivized to compete for patients based on both the cost and quality of care, the massive waste of resources produced by this predictable market failure is unlikely to be remediated. The Maine law is one approach that just might open the door to such developments.
In addition to transparent pricing and rewards, a third key feature of the Maine law allows out-of-network providers to compete for patients on a level playing field. In other words, you can see any provider you want out of network, as long as they are lower-cost. Together, these ingredients could set off a race to provide high-quality care at lower prices. In addition, this policy would provide a counterweight to the growing trend toward hospital consolidation and narrower insurer networks, both of which reduce patient options. Consolidation drives prices and expenditures higher.
By combining transparent prices that enable a patient to shop with financial rewards for accessing the best-value providers — independent of insurer network — incentives may finally align to improve quality and reduce cost of care.
Like many legislatively driven health care solutions, Maine's new law certainly won't solve all the problems in health care. But broader application of Right to Shop could catalyze innovation to improve both cost and quality. Indications of bipartisan interest in the Maine law on the part of state lawmakers across the country suggest this approach could help break today's partisan health care legislative gridlock. Why? At the risk of overgeneralizing: Republicans are drawn to the potential for more competition and Democrats to greater access to care, and both like the outcome of lower costs.
Some incumbent providers will probably resist this change, fearing price competition, and insurers may claim this would burden them with added administrative costs. Yet without innovations like Right to Shop, we'll be stuck with high prices and inconsistent quality — the worst possible combination.
In 2018, federal lawmakers would be wise to consider similar efforts by rewarding patients who can shop on both private and public-subsidized insurance, like Healthcare.gov, Medicare, and Medicaid. Without such sensible innovations, many patients, whether insured or not, will struggle to afford care. With respect to both cost and quality of health care, Maine's new law could be just what the doctor ordered.
Dr. Jeffrey S. Flier, former dean at Harvard Medical School, is distinguished service professor at the school. Josh Archambault is a senior fellow at the Foundation for Government Accountability and the Pioneer Institute.

Cigarette butt receptacles gain fans, but in city, a bit of a stink

Texto completo: Mike Roylos dislikes cigarette butt litter so intensely that he sold his Greek cafe in Monument Square in 2015 so he could focus his attention on growing a business aimed at cleaning up the streets.
In the past few years, the Sidewalk Buttler business has taken off well beyond its beginnings in Portland. His cigarette butt receptacles, which are fastened to street signs and light posts, are now in 26 states. And Roylos said he currently is working on fulfilling a 10,000-unit order for a cigarette company.
Cigarette butts are a common form of litter that often end up in waterways, especially in coastal communities like Portland. The invention, originally designed as a plastic tube painted to look like a mustachioed butler in a bow tie and bowler hat, is credited with cleaning up Portland sidewalks. Now Roylos is seeking a more formal agreement with his hometown to take over maintenance of the original Buttler stations around Portland.
"It's made a big difference," said Tom Watson, whose Port Property Management has purchased about two dozen units and installed them near its downtown apartment complexes.
Watson also has noticed a difference outside his office in Longfellow Square, where a Buttler is installed. "There seems to be very few (butts) to none in front of the building," he said.
Since launching a pilot program in 2013, Roylos has installed just over 200 Sidewalk Buttlers throughout the city. The cheeky butler design has been replaced with a more durable aluminum design. They cost about $99 each; the prototype was $39.
The units have been largely sponsored by local businesses and environmental groups. The butts were originally collected by Roylos, who sent them to Terracycle in New Jersey so the plastic filters could be recycled into new plastic products.
Steve DiMillo Sr. bought about 53 units to install, mostly on Long Wharf. DiMillo said his company, which operates DiMillo's On the Water restaurant, empties and services the units because they're on private property.
"It kills me to see smokers flick their cigarette into the street," DiMillo said. "We thought it was a cost-effective way for us to help the situation. There's less cigarette butts on the property now."
But now, a disagreement with the city could lead to the removal of some of the Buttlers installed on public property.
Roylos said he had an agreement with city officials that they would take over the emptying and servicing of the units on public property by using workfare participants who receive General Assistance from the city. But for the past two years he has been getting complaints about the units not being emptied and being in poor condition, with locks seized and collection tubes missing.
"The city has just reneged completely on their agreement," Roylos said. "Portland is the only city we work with that has a problem."
CITY GETS COMPLAINTS, TENSIONS RISE
City Manager Jon Jennings is looking to rein in the program, saying that except for the pilot program, there has never been a formal agreement with Roylos for the ongoing installation and maintenance of additional Buttlers. He has been receiving complaints from downtown businesses about the proliferation of the units. The city repeatedly has asked Roylos to stop installing the units on public property, he said.
"There was no follow-up" after the pilot program was launched, Jennings said. "And this gentleman has continued to go out and sell the Buttlers to businesses - and making money - and expecting the city to do the maintenance."
Portland Downtown, a nonprofit business-district improvement group representing downtown business and property owners, purchased more than a dozen units during the pilot stage. Executive Director Casey Gilbert said the proliferation of units has led to a "lopsided" arrangement between Roylos, who is making money, and the city, which is expected to maintain the units.
"There are a myriad of issues that come into play, which include environmental concerns around cigarette waste, public health, and the negative externalities associated with the municipal government absorbing the expense of this program," she said in an email. "While Portland Downtown does not have the final say, the outcome will absolutely affect our downtown public works team, our downtown property owners, and those who live, work and visit downtown."
In March, Jennings sent a letter to Roylos proposing that the city take over units in the public way at no cost. The two sides planned to meet next month to discuss the details, but Jennings canceled the meeting after Roylos sent an email to councilors and the press with the subject line "Dismantling Sidewalk Buttler Program."
Jennings said in an interview that the city will take over the units on public property beginning in May. He sent Roylos a list of about 60 units that need to be replaced because the locks don't work or the units are missing key components. If that is not done by the end of May, Jennings said they will be removed.
"If we're doing to do the maintenance, we're going to oversee the program and limit the number of Buttlers in the public way," he said.
Jennings said the city also plans to remove the units from public parks, where smoking is prohibited.
"There is a public benefit to this," Jennings said, referring to cleaner city streets. "We appreciate everything Mr. Roylos has done for the city. But of course this got out of hand. We should have had better monitoring of this, and that's what we're doing now."
BUSINESS GROWS OUTSIDE OF MAINE
The issues in Portland come as Roylos is expanding his presence nationally. He said his Buttlers are in 25 other states, including Oregon, South Carolina and Florida. Each community has its own system for emptying and maintaining the units, some of which have QR scan codes so groups can monitor usage, he said.
After being named Score Maine's Best Green Small Business last year, Roylos said he was recruited by the Altria Group, the parent company of Philip Morris, to build 10,000 units for a national campaign. Those units are being produced in a new workspace in Scarborough.
Roylos is also one of 13 semifinalists for at $100,000 prize from Green Light Maine.
"Cities love what we're doing because it gives them an opportunity to combat cigarette litter," he said. "We give smokers the opportunity to not litter."
Roylos said he plans to offer 60 additional units to his home city of Portland. But the donation would come with conditions - primarily that they only be used to replace the old plastic units or to increase the number of units on public ways.
"The end result will be a cleaner city, sidewalks and water," he said. "Who is to find fault with that?"

Texto completo: LEWISTON -- Fatuma Hussein, 38, was not just part of the first wave of Somali immigrants who came to Lewiston in 2001. She helped make that wave.
On Tuesday, the organization she founded in 2002, The Immigrant Resource Center of Maine - formerly known as United Somali Women of Maine - will celebrate its anniversary at the Hilton Garden Inn Auburn Riverwatch.
The United Somali Women of Maine was the first successful refugee organization in Lewiston, former Deputy City Administrator Phil Nadeau said. He worked with the arriving immigrants.
"Her work to create one of the most successful immigrant organizations in the state has earned her recognition at the state and national level," Nadeau said.
She is well-known and well-regarded across Maine, the subject of several newspaper and magazine articles.
For what Hussein has done, she was given an honorary degree from Bowdoin College in 2017.
Born in Somalia, she fled the violence from the civil war when she was a youth. She lived in refugee camps in Kenya and immigrated to Atlanta, where in high school she met Muktan Hersi, the man who would become her husband.
They now have eight children, several of whom are in college.
Hussein arrived in Portland on a snowy February day in 2001 looking for a better place to live. She was welcomed by Somali refugees crammed into an overcrowded shelter or tiny apartments.
She asked them why they stayed in Portland. They told her they were advised to move to Lewiston, "but they said: 'We're very afraid. None of us live there,'" Hussein said.
Pregnant with her third child, Hussein asked for the contact information and went to Lewiston, greeted by a fresh blanket of snow.
"It was most beautiful" and peaceful, she said. "It was quiet. No tall, tall buildings, no traffic."
She met with three Somali families living at Hillview apartments on Rideout Avenue, who told her Lewiston was a good place to live.
Hussein went back to Portland, then Atlanta, and told Somali refugees they needed to move to Lewiston.
"This is a safe place," she recalled telling them. "Lewiston would be the best thing that ever happened to you."
In March 2001, 50 Somali families moved to Lewiston, followed by many more.
"Nobody knew that we were coming," she said. "Nobody was prepared."
City officials hired their first Somali case manager to help. The manager asked Hussein if she would speak to the State Refugee Advisory Council. She said she had never given a public presentation.
"You're a woman," the manager told her. "They will listen to you."
She did, and it was the beginning of her advocacy work.
A few months later, she was meeting with a representative of a Coastal Enterprise program that helped refugees. Hussein was asked what would be her dream to help Lewiston's new residents.
Her answer: A women's center to provide English speaking skills, help with getting jobs and help with accessing programs.
She was told, "Go write a proposal."
She did.
Before long, she was approved for a $40,000 grant from the Maine Department of Health and Human Services, with Community Concepts serving as the fiscal agent.
But with no community to help, she scheduled a meeting of Somali women at the Multi-Purpose Center in Lewiston in May 2002.
On a Saturday, "100 women showed up. We came up with a name, a vision, what services we would do," she said.
The United Somali Women of Maine provided all kinds of help.
"We were doing anything. But our first order of business was working with the school systems in Lewiston and Auburn, making sure schools had what they needed" to help students, Hussein said.
The organization was so named because most of the immigrants it helped were women and children whose male family members died in the violence in Somalia.
The name was changed later to better reflect help for all immigrants.
The programs meant a lot of work and volunteerism from the Somali immigrants.
"If we were going to succeed it had to be a two-way street," Hussein said. "It wasn't just Lewiston-Auburn and Maine giving to us. We were going to do our part."
One big part was community education, understanding how things worked. For instance, initially there was a high rate of child protective services cases with immigrants.
"We'd bring providers to the community so they could talk about what they do," Hussein said. "That was empowering."
Reflecting on what the Immigrant Resource Center has done since its formation, Hussein said it has given voices to many people, whether through helping women break out of domestic violence or living in housing without lead poisoning.
"We have brought an awareness, courage, resiliency and, more than anything, hope to the very systems and communities we've interacted with," Hussein said.

Travis Mills plays host as veterans tour retreat

Texto completo: ROME -- During the spring open house Sunday at the Travis Mills Foundation Veterans Retreat, U.S. Sen. Angus King defended a Senate colleague who is being sharply criticized by President Trump.
On Saturday, Trump called on Sen. Jon Tester, D-Mont., to resign after Tester released a series of allegations that led Ronny Jackson to withdraw his name last week from consideration to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs.
Among the allegations were that Jackson, a Navy rear admiral and the White House physician, drank on the job and improperly prescribed and dispensed medications.
"What happened this time was really unfortunate," King said, "but it's not typical. Tester, who is getting all this flak, I checked, voted for 14 of Trump's nominees to the VA, he voted for Dr. Shulkin, and he voted for and supported seven or eight bills the president has signed on veterans matters. He's not an anti-Trump guy. He just got these reports from military people and he couldn't sweep them under the rug."
Trump fired David Shulkin, who had served as Veterans Affairs secretary, in March.
King said he hopes Trump's next nominee will have the management skills and experience to run the second-largest department in the federal government.
But national affairs were not center stage Sunday - that role belonged to Mills, who spent the afternoon meeting and talking with visitors, signing books and standing with veterans for photos on the front lawn of the Travis Mills Foundation's retreat.
With the energy of a showman, Mills joked and flirted and at one point announced the birthday of a veteran named Tom, leading the people assembled in an enthusiastic and off-key rendition of "Happy Birthday to You."
The retreat for wounded veterans and their families opened last summer. It includes a handicapped-accessible lodge, lake access, kayaks, bicycles, paddleboards, a movie theater, a children's play space and other amenities.
Mills, a retired U.S. Army staff sergeant, lost all four of his limbs after surviving an explosion in Afghanistan. He started his foundation to raise money for wounded veterans.
For Leo and Chris Deon of Farmington, Sunday's event was a chance to see the veterans' retreat - the former Elizabeth Arden estate perched on a hill overlooking Long Pond in northwestern Kennebec County.
Leo Deon, retired from the U.S. Coast Guard after 21 years, is now a consultant at the Maine Career Center and a veterans representative. He has seen Mills at several events for veterans and wanted to come out to support him.
"We wanted to get some information possibly to volunteer," Chris Deon said.
If they follow through, they will join the ranks of the many volunteers who contribute to operating the retreat - from groundskeeping and housekeeping to running programs for the veterans and selling merchandise.
"They are the lifeblood of what makes us work. We need everything to make a traditional home operate," said foundation executive director Brandy Cain.
The foundation has more than 300 volunteers, including some who travel from other states to spend a few days helping out.
"We're kind of like a duck on the water, paddling underneath and smooth on top," Cain said.
Barbara McCosh, who just relocated to Rome from Manchester, New Hampshire, has been watching the progress at the retreat and has been following Mills on social media and on television, and she was looking forward to meeting him.
"I just think he's inspiring," she said.

Shocker: Opposition forms to Maine hydro plan

Texto completo: Here's a shocker: The state's latest plan to obtain clean electricity from dams in Canada has run into opposition.
In a recent report in the Globe, David Abel outlined the worries raised by Mainers, who expressed mixed feelings about an electric conduit for Massachusetts running through their communities. Some consider the towers and cables unsightly, and don't want to host a superhighway for another state's electricity. Others welcome the revenues the 145-mile transmission line would provide for towns along the route.
The project still has permits left to obtain, which should provide an opportunity for supporters and opponents to air their concerns.
Somewhere — in New Hampshire, to be exact — proponents of Northern Pass are chortling. That rival transmission project through the Granite State was the state's first choice but became a lightning rod for controversy. Northern Pass maintained that the rivals would become just as divisive too, once they left the drawing boards and communities were confronted with the real possibility of power lines in their backyards. Looks like Northern Pass may have been onto something.
Hopefully, federal and state authorities will find a way to make the Maine transmission project work, since the 1,200 megawatts of hydropower the line would make available are crucial to reducing the Commonwealth's greenhouse gas emissions. But the opposition — which mirrors the pushback against virtually any energy infrastructure — shows the difficulties that state energy policies, which are often built on best-case scenarios, can face. With enough pushback, the state's initial hope of putting the transmission line in service by 2020 is at risk.
Massachusetts is now weighing a second clean energy procurement, this one for offshore wind projects. Wind companies have been roaming Southeastern Massachusetts, promising speedy completion of offshore farms.
As a technological matter, wind farms — and electric transmission lines — are mature technologies. Increasingly, the obstacles to building them are legal, economic, or political. The bottom line: Dividing up the offshore wind procurement, so that the whole project isn't hanging on one company's abililty to navigate those shoals, continues to look like a good idea.
When the transmission line opens, Massachusetts will claw back the carbon-free energy it's about to lose at the Pilgrim nuclear station — and then some. That helps Maine, too. It's a message that should prevail, but it'll be up to the line's developer and proponents to make that case.

Don't oust Scarborough board members

Texto completo: We are writing to share our support for the qualified and competent Scarborough Board of Education members and to urge Scarborough citizens to vote "no" in the recall election May 8.
These board members (Donna Beeley, Cari Lyford and Jodi Shea) are dedicated to making decisions based on the best interests of all Scarborough students. Using a recall to attempt to solve dissenting opinions in the town and the district is not the correct path to strengthen our schools and is not the precedent Scarborough should set.
Please consider the following repercussions if the recall passes:
n
Come November, we would have two board members with one year of experience and five inexperienced members. Performing the duties of the Board of Education effectively and competently in that environment will be challenging. Also, what and who will make the new Board of Education so much better?
n
Finding people to run for the Board of Education will become much harder. It is already a thankless job. Who will want to take the risk?
n
Thousands of dollars would be spent if the new board chose to end the superintendent's contract, not to mention the costs of finding a replacement. The pool of applicants that Scarborough could attract after such vitriol would be minimal at best.
The three targeted Board of Education members are indeed competent, so let's let the democratic process proceed as it should. Scarborough citizens can vote and/or run for the two new board openings in November. We would still have experience on the board, and we would have some fresh voices as well. The Board of Education members do not deserve to be caught in the middle of this chaos.
Please vote "no" on May 8 to send the message that this is not the way to solve disagreements. Thank you for your consideration.

It's hard for parents to find good help for troubled child
Regarding the letter headlined "Youths taking action to prevent suicides" (Page A4, April 24): As a parent who struggled to find help for a now-grown child, let me make it clear: The stigma and shame came as the result of seeking help, both from professionals and other community resources.
One of the most stinging and unjust rebukes I endured came from a therapist who told me I "lacked empathy" for my child, though they knew of my long search for help.
Clearly, I was paying attention to my son, and suffering on his behalf. The not-so-subtle point I was constantly speared with was this: "If you were a 'good' mother, your child would be fine."
Few wanted to acknowledge that good therapeutic intervention for minors was grossly lacking in Maine. Thus, it was easier to blame the parent than help the child.
My child eventually was diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. I found a good book with which to educate myself. A detailed profile of characteristics of one type of ADHD described him exactly. The book also included interviews with parents. One statement, repeated over and over: "I never thought being a parent would be so hard." (Read, "I never thought I would be this alone to help my child.")
I talked about my child's problems, loud and clear. It did not make either my child or me feel "less alone," in the words of the letter. I regret every single therapist I let in my child's life, for the damage they did, to the pain they exacerbated.
"Awareness" alone isn't enough. It makes it too easy to find a convenient target to blame, even demonize. It is education and knowledge we need, and there is not nearly enough to go around.

Maine families in dire need of single-payer health care
My grandmother recently turned 91. She lives on a farm in Tennessee and has always prided herself on being happy and healthy. However, as one enters old age, health deteriorates. Even with the best medical care, her bills have increased over the years. Thus, with as much time as my extended family spends with her, the amount of time set aside for bills is always increasing.
One day, my father and in-laws will most likely live with me. As much as I will spend every second I have with them, I as well will have to set aside time for medical bills.
We need a single-payer health care system here in Maine. Not only will it be more affordable for my family in the long run, there will be less paperwork and fewer limitations and it will allow my family to spend every second together. Every family in Maine should have this time. With a single-payer system, every individual in Maine will have not only this time, but also full medical coverage.
So even if you are happy and healthy, remember the individuals who are not. Remember the individuals who do not have time with their families. Going forward as a state, our path is clear: We must embrace single-payer health care.

Lawyer Segal enters race for Cumberland judge of probate
I am pleased to announce my candidacy for judge of probate for Cumberland County as a Democrat. I currently have a solo law practice in Portland, which I have maintained for almost 30 years.
I am a native of Portland, having grown up on Munjoy Hill, where my parents had a mom-and-pop grocery store for many years. I continue to reside in Portland.
I graduated from Portland High School as valedictorian, followed, in 1970, by my bachelor of arts degree from Bowdoin College. I received my master's degree in psychology from Duquesne University in Pittsburgh. Subsequently I graduated from the University of Maine School of Law in 1987.
After graduating from law school, I served as a law clerk to U.S. Claims Court Judge Thomas J. Lydon in Washington, D.C., followed by two years as law clerk in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for Portland. As a law clerk, I had the opportunity to actively participate in the judicial process.
My current general law practice includes bankruptcy, wills and estates and co-guardian work, as well as child protective, mental health and criminal cases.
I would like to serve Cumberland County residents in this capacity because it reflects the work that I have done on behalf of many over the course of 30 years, and I can continue to serve Cumberland County residents in related areas of the law.

Support Maine legislation to prevent 'food shaming' of students
Over the past year, shocking reports of school "food shaming" have come out across the United States. "Food shaming" refers to when students are denied food, given an alternate meal, forced to complete chores to pay for the meal, or otherwise stigmatized for having school lunch debt that their families are unable to pay off.
In an effort to combat this, Maine legislators are considering L.D. 1684, a measure that would prevent Maine's public schools from food shaming children whose parents have an overdue lunch balance.
While some opponents of this bill may think that this is just a problem of parents not paying for their children's lunches, we believe that the accumulation of school lunch debt reflects a larger problem of poverty and food insecurity in Maine.
Of all the New England states, Maine has the highest rate of child food insecurity (21.4 percent), which means that 21.4 percent of children in Maine lack reliable access to a sufficient quantity of affordable, nutritious food.
According to Feeding America, in Maine's 1st Congressional District, 48 percent of children identified as "food insecure" are likely from families that don't qualify for free and reduced-price lunch. This means that there are many families in Maine experiencing food insecurity who are expected to pay full price for school meals.
For many of these students living in food-insecure homes, school lunch may be the only consistent meal of the day.
While we must think of creative solutions to financially support school lunch programs, shaming students should never be a way to persuade parents to pay their bills. By supporting L.D. 1684, we are helping to ensure that all Maine children attend schools where they are able to access lunch without being stigmatized for debt that is out of their control.
We urge you to support L.D. 1684 and advocate by contacting your local legislators.

Texto completo: Lately, it's almost impossible to avoid getting swept up into the bluster of Washington drama. I write this as a reminder for all of us to keep tabs on the happenings that are creeping behind sexy headlines about Stormy Daniels. The fact is that the current administration has been moving forward rapidly to advance questionable policies. The latest example being the 2018 Farm Bill (H.R. 2), which cleared the House Agriculture Committee on April 18.
Maine has the third highest rate of hunger, or "very low food security," in the United States. One in seven Mainers utilizes the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, formerly known as food stamps, to put food on the table. According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, 68 percent of these Mainers are families, more than 46 percent are in households with a disabled or elderly person, and over 42 percent are "working poor" families.
We're all well aware that Maine's labor force is often seasonal, because of our strong economic dependency on tourism and hospitality. Well-paying, steady jobs are not easy to come by. There is a lot of good work going on to advance workforce and economic development across the state, but in the meantime many Mainers are left without enough money to buy nutritious food, make rent, pay for child care and heat their homes. SNAP is a lifeline, offering folks a very modest meal stipend based on household income and necessary expenses.
While many Mainers graciously volunteer their time, energy and resources to the charitable food system of pantries across the state, this "system" simply cannot and does not fight hunger. The reality is that many people in need do not have access to transportation. Food pantries are open for limited hours, and, in our rural areas, pantry locations are few and far between.
Further, food pantries receive very little to no fresh produce - a commodity that people need desperately in a state where 30 percent of the population is obese and 11 percent suffer from Type 2 diabetes. These conditions disproportionately affect our low-income individuals, and it's clear that Mainers need access to more fresh produce, not preserved sweets. If you've never been to a food pantry before, I suggest you pay a visit - there will be cake and lots of it.
So, what does the Farm Bill have to do with hunger in Maine? SNAP is funded through the Farm Bill. The bill that passed the House Agriculture Committee cuts SNAP funding by more than $20 billion over the next 10 years, largely achieving those savings by imposing work requirements on recipients. This includes parents caring for small children, unemployed adults between jobs and underemployed "work-capable adults."
Work requirements might sound nice as a concept, but they are historically ineffective. We already have work requirements for able-bodied adults without dependents here in Maine. Thousands of Mainers have lost benefits, and there are no data to show that these folks are back at work. Work requirements necessitate available work, which - as referenced - is not readily available here in Maine.
Further, the Farm Bill's work mandate requires SNAP recipients to turn in pay stubs to the Maine Department of Health and Human Services every month. This is nearly impossible when phone wait times are over 90 minutes and documents that are sent in on time are frequently lost or not filed.
I send in paperwork for my clients on a daily basis and have been told by four different DHHS caseworkers that I must "follow up on every document because (the department) does not have the time or manpower to file everything." This bill would require spending additional resources at the state and federal level to effectively manage these new administrative requirements - that is the opposite of efficiently using taxpayer dollars and a bureaucratic nightmare.
Several other SNAP changes outlined in the Farm Bill pose further burdens on our social safety net and public resources. I beg you to look into this issue for yourself - before Congress returns from recess May 7. The Food Research and Action Center, an anti-hunger organization, provides ample analysis and information on this bill. Please call Reps. Bruce Poliquin and Chellie Pingree today. Tell them to vote "no" on H.R. 2 and say "no" to SNAP cuts.
The United States spends significantly less money on social services than the rest of the industrialized world, and we are paying for our frugality in skyrocketing health care costs and rampant poverty. Withholding food from people will not help them get back to work. We need SNAP funding. Don't sit idly by. If you do, I suggest you prepare yourself for the health care costs associated with forcing our neighbors to subsist on cake.

Texto completo: WINDHAM -- The Town Council has continued a moratorium on development in Windham's portion of the Highland Lake watershed but modified the 180-day ban to allow for certain projects to move forward.
The narrowed moratorium would scale back the restrictions on smaller projects while continuing to put a hold on subdivision development, projects requiring site plan review by the Planning Board and the construction of new private roads.
The council voted 6-1 last week in favor of the amended Highland Lake moratorium, with Councilor Clayton Haskell the only member opposed.
The original ban on certain development activities within the watershed was first passed in September 2017 in response to concerns about the lake's health, and was scheduled to expire in early March.
The council voted in late February to extend the development ban but was required by the town charter to have another vote within 60 days because the extension was passed as an emergency measure.
Since the measure was originally passed, Windham has worked with Falmouth to create a Highland Lake Leadership team and enacted surface water-protection ordinance changes in the watershed.
The Highland Lake Association has supported the moratorium since the beginning and raised alarms about the health of the lake - particularly in the wake of a temporary bloom, believed to be cyanobacteria, that has hit the lake the past four summers.
Lake association board member Dennis Brown said the group supports the scaled-back version of the moratorium.
"Highland Lake Association supports modifying the moratorium so that small projects can move forward," Brown said.
"We think it's essential that it stays in place some time longer for subdivisions and commercial projects, and there's several reasons for that."
Brown expressed concern about the existing town and Maine Department of Environmental Protection review process for larger projects, saying that some details can be missed.
He also mentioned the lake association's watershed survey on May 19, which aims to pinpoint potential areas and sources of excess nutrients in the lake.
Rich Merk, who owns land that he's been trying to sell in the watershed, has addressed the council previously about how the moratorium has hindered potential sales.
He thanked the council at its meeting for considering the modifications.
"I think the town has got a long way to go - I think you've come a long way already," Merk said. "Having the modifications will probably get more support as you take the time to develop information that you need to make decisions, and as you spend time educating the public on the resource issue."
Town Manager Tony Plante also mentioned several proposed ordinance amendments for the Highland Lake watershed that the lake association has put forth and the Planning Board has recently endorsed.
The board voted 5-2 last week to recommend adoption of the lake association's suggestion to lower the allowed phosphorous allocation for a subdivision or site plan project, remove the ability for a subdivision developer to pay a fee in order to exceed the phosphorous limit, and prohibit density bonuses for cluster subdivisions.
Those changes would apply only to the Highland Lake watershed.
The lake association also has pushed for those changes to be made retroactive to the same Sept. 5 enactment date of the original moratorium.
Plante said the earliest that the formal Planning Board recommendation on the ordinance changes could come before the council would be May 22.
"I support this - extending it. I think it's a good idea that we allow individual homebuilders to start building their homes and getting things going," Councilor Tim Nangle said about the amended moratorium.
"My feeling is we rescind this moratorium as soon as we have the ordinance language in and in effect so that we can restart business as usual.
"Don't take that the wrong way. Not business as past, but we can restart allowing these types of developments, providing they meet all the requirements."

Texto completo: If states are, as in a popular phrase, the "laboratories of democracy," then the results of an experiment in Maine have a lot to teach us.
In this experiment, Gov. LePage took from tens of thousands of poor residents benefits from the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program, more commonly known as SNAP or food stamps, under the idea that it would force those residents to find work and thus remove themselves from government dependency.
Not many got jobs they wouldn't have eventually found otherwise, and most of those who did find work likely still qualified for assistance. Meanwhile, hunger in Maine got worse, even as it improved almost everywhere else.
In short, it's been a disaster for the poorest Mainers. Still, House Republicans want to take this experiment nationwide.
ANOTHER BARRIER
Included in the 2019 Farm Bill are provisions that build on what conservatives see as progress in Maine. Together, these provisions, including one from Maine Republican Rep. Bruce Poliquin, would make work requirements more strict.
These requirements would force SNAP recipients to work, volunteer or participate in training 20 hours a week. If they miss more than three months of activity in a four-year span, they lose their benefits. Children, the disabled and the elderly - as well as pregnant women and caretakers of a child under 6 - are excluded.
These barriers may not sound like much, but they come out of a profound misunderstanding of how these Americans live.
Most of them work intermittently at a series of unstable, low-paying jobs with uncertain schedules. Many look after someone at home, or have health problems of their own that fall short of disability but still get in the way of steady work.
They use SNAP when work dries up, or their car breaks down, or their health takes a turn for the worse. It's not the average benefit of $123 per month - or $4 a day - that is keeping them home, but any number of troubles or missteps that can derail a vulnerable person who does not have the resources to weather them.
When work requirements are entered into these stressful, white-knuckle lives, they become just another barrier. Beneficiaries don't run afoul of them because they are lazy or apathetic. Instead, they live in a rural area without training or work opportunities, or they can't get to them, or they're needed at home. Often, they run into an ambivalent bureaucracy when they try to figure out what to do.
WRONG WAY ON HUNGER
That's what happened here, as the number of SNAP beneficiaries in Maine declined from 243,301 in 2010 to 178,193 in 2017.
Some of those Mainers found work as the economy improved. Some likely found jobs through state training programs.
But for the vast majority, life just got a whole lot harder. If work requirements worked as they are supposed to, we could expect to see hunger in Maine fall along with the SNAP numbers. Instead, while most of the country was improving, Maine got worse. People removed from SNAP didn't find a job - they instead began relying on food pantries, which have set new records.
Instead of following the poor example set by Maine, House Republicans of 2018 should look to the House Republicans of 2014.
Four years ago, the Farm Bill included experimental programs that made work and training provisions voluntary. Some of these programs have been quite successful, as they allow limited training funds to be focused on people who volunteered.
A full report is due in March 2019. If the point is to help people better their lives, rather than simply cut the welfare rolls, Congress should wait until we see what these programs can do.

Heavily armed search teams detected evidence of activity in the woods and eventually found John D. Williams outside a small, remote camp in Fairfield.

Texto completo: Police searching for suspected cop killer John D. Williams were confident they had contained him in the marshy, wooded area near Bear Mountain and Lost Brook, west of Route 139, where the towns of Norridgewock and Fairfield meet.
"Each day we assembled teams from federal, state, local and county agencies to slowly and methodically search the difficult terrain - each day moving, searching for evidence and any signs of movement by the suspect," Maine State Police Lt. Col. John Cote told reporters Saturday afternoon.
Police say Williams, 29, of Madison shot and killed Cpl. Eugene Cole of the Somerset County Sheriff's Office in the early morning hours of Wednesday in Norridgewock. Cole, a 13-year veteran of the sheriff's office, was the first Maine police officer fatally shot in the line of duty since 1989.
Police said Williams then stole Cole's cruiser and tried to rob a convenience store in Norridgewock. Cole's cruiser was later found abandoned on Martin Stream Road in that town, and Williams was on the run.
What followed over the next four days was a sprawling, frantic manhunt involving an estimated 200 armed police officers, sheriff's deputies and game wardens from all over Maine, as well as New Hampshire and Massachusetts, along with federal authorities from the FBI, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the U.S. Border Patrol and the U.S. Marshals Service.
It ended with Williams' arrest about 12:43 p.m. Saturday on Norridgewock Road in Fairfield, not far from the search grid marking a wide area around Martin Stream Road.
The handcuffs that police placed on Williams were the very ones that Cole had used.
"I thought that it was fitting, where he killed my deputy - Corporal Gene Cole - and he was brought to justice using Cole's handcuffs," Somerset County Sheriff Dale Lancaster said during a final briefing on the manhunt Saturday afternoon.
FOOT TRACKS, OTHER CLUES FOUND
Cote - who is second in command of the Maine State Police and is soon to be sworn in as a colonel and chief of the force - said that during the search, police had to be on guard for the possibility of a continuing threat from Williams, whom they had determined to be armed and dangerous. He said critical evidence was found - foot tracks and other signs of human activity - during the searches. Each day the teams - heavily armed and some with search dogs - covered more ground and set target ground to be covered the next day, Cote said.
Helicopters were sent up when the weather was right.
"Throughout the week we found tracks that appeared to be fresh," Cote said.
On Saturday, one of the search teams found Williams outside a small, remote camp in the area of Lost Brook.
"In a testament to the teamwork that has been evidenced throughout this case, the seven-man capture team was comprised of members of the Maine Warden Service, the Maine State Police, the Fairfield, Maine, Police Department and the FBI," Cote said.
He said Williams exerted "limited resistance."
Williams was taken to the Maine State Prison in Warren rather than Somerset County Jail in East Madison at the request of county jail officials, said Joseph Fitzpatrick, commissioner of the Maine Department of Corrections. In a statement Saturday night, Fitzpatrick called Williams' diversion to the state prison a "routine process" used when a county jail has an inmate who requires additional security precautions for secure confinement while awaiting trial or sentencing.
Fitzpatrick said state police arrived at the state prison with Williams about 5:30 p.m. Saturday. He was received, screened by medical staff and placed into secure housing. A prison official confirmed Williams' presence there Sunday but would not release any other information.
Authorities had initially said that Williams would be taken to the Maine Correctional Center in Windham.
Williams is expected to make his initial court appearance this week, but it could not be determined Sunday night exactly when or where that will be. The state police Major Crimes Unit is investigating the slaying of Cpl. Cole, and the Maine Attorney General's Office will prosecute the case.
Cote said police have learned from previous manhunts, including that of Robert Burton in 2015, to establish a plan early in the investigation.
"In this case, from day one, we approached this manhunt as if it would go for a long time," Cote said. "We knew to establish the command structure, the teamwork, from the very beginning. ... From the first few hours we had the right people plugged in, clear roles and objectives for everybody ... using the idea that no one of us is as smart as all of us."
The long ordeal began at 1:42 a.m. Wednesday with a report of a robbery at the Cumberland Farms store on Waterville Road in Norridgewock.
A man, later identified as Williams, was seen entering the store on video footage from the dashboard camera of Cole's marked cruiser.
Hours later, Cole's body was discovered in a woman's yard on Mercer Road, also known as U.S. Route 2, near downtown Norridgewock. Investigators learned that Williams had lived in that house as a teenager after he had a falling-out with his parents.
Police said Williams, who was scheduled to appear in court that day in Massachusetts on gun charges, had shot Cole and stolen his cruiser. The fully marked cruiser was found abandoned on Martin Stream Road in Norridgewock.
Precious few details on the shooting and the ensuing manhunt have been released by police.
"There will be times when that information comes out throughout the process, but this is not the time for those details yet to be released," Cote told reporters on Saturday.
After Williams' capture, police said only that he was not injured and that he was checked by medical personnel before being taken for questioning to the Waterville Police Department. He was later transferred to the state prison in Warren.
Cole, 61, had been involved days earlier in the arrest of Williams' girlfriend, Kristina Pomerleau, on charges related to cocaine possession, but police were tightlipped as to the details of that relationship and whether it had anything to do with Cole's death.
Pressed by reporters Saturday, Cote would not say if Williams was armed when he was apprehended. He said Williams was the only suspect in the shooting, but would not offer details about how police knew that.
The arresting officers were not wearing body cameras, he said.
Police have not said if Cole was on duty when he encountered Williams, although the radio log from the communications center lists Cole - his call number Somerset 1312 - as being one of several units dispatched to the robbery report at Cumberland Farms at 1:42 a.m.
Police also have not said if it was Cole's weapon that was used to kill him or if the weapon was found. Cole's body was not discovered until 7:15 a.m. Wednesday. Authorities said Cole was shot between 1 and 2 a.m. The cruiser was found abandoned shortly after 5 a.m. off Martin Stream Road in Norridgewock, police said.
"We believe the suspect then fled the vehicle on foot," state police said in a news release Wednesday morning.
MOTIVE FOR KILLING STILL UNKNOWN
Police have offered no motive in the killing.
It also is not clear if Cole's cruiser had a GPS device that would have made it easier to track. Police would not say if Williams had food or supplies to help him survive the cold, wet weather in woods or if he had been in contact with anyone while on the lam.
Around 11:15 a.m. Wednesday, Cole's body was taken out in a state police evidence response truck with a state police cruiser ahead of it, lights flashing, en route to the medical examiner's office in Augusta. A shoulder-to-shoulder line of police officers stood at attention near the scene.
As the procession left, a flurry of police sirens echoed across the downtown. Officers stood at attention and saluted as the body was delivered to the medical examiner's office in Augusta.
Cole's body was returned to Skowhegan amid a procession of police cars, lights flashing and sirens blaring later in the day.
Visiting hours will be held from 4-7 p.m., Sunday, May 6, at the Skowhegan Armory, 11 North School St., Skowhegan. A celebration of Cole's life will be held at noon Monday, May 7, at the Cross Insurance Center, 515 Main St., Bangor, with Chaplain Kevin Brooks officiating.

Festival bans politics from annual parade

Texto completo: ROCKLAND -- Gov. Paul LePage, Sens. Angus King and Susan Collins, U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree and Knox County Sheriff's Office Chief Deputy Tim Carroll - a former president of the Maine Lobster Festival - are among those people who will not be allowed to march in this year's festival parade.
The festival board voted Tuesday to exclude all political organizations and candidates from the annual parade scheduled for the first Saturday in August.
The online application for parade entrants already includes the new policy.
"The Maine Lobster Festival Parade is a nonpartisan, secular and neutral private event which celebrates our community, our people and our lobsters. Because of this, we will no longer be accepting political applications. We anticipate and appreciate your respect of this policy," the policy says.
Board President Cynthia Powell said in these highly charged political times, there were other entrants to the parade who did not want to be marching alongside and be associated with various political groups.
Powell said the policy is fair because it excludes all political groups.
"We want to celebrate the lobster industry, celebrate the community and not necessarily make a political statement," she said.
Representatives of local political parties questioned the action.
"I am troubled by this decision," said Rockland Democratic Chairman Gerald Weinand.
"Maine has a long tradition of candidates marching in parades held throughout the state, where they often zig-zag from curb to curb to shake hands and have a brief chat with constituents," Weinand said.
"Ironically, it is just this sort of person-to-person contact that can help to defuse the 'highly charged political times' that Board President Powell laments," he said.

Maine sees unexpected sales growth as shoppers pay up online

Texto completo: State bean counters got a surprise this year: unusually vigorous winter spending on merchandise and lodging that seems fueled by online retailers.
In the first two months of 2018, sales of some merchandise and lodging grew by double digits, adding more than $4 million to the state's sales tax coffers, compared with the same period last year.
Sales of jewelry, books, toys, pet products and other specialty items are up 16.5 percent compared to last year, lodging sales are up almost 29 percent, and general merchandise sales are up 7 percent, according to a Maine Revenue Services report released April 20.
State officials suspect online companies now collecting and remitting taxes are responsible for much of the sales growth in a historically slow retail period, said Michael Allen, associate commissioner for tax policy. Some of the growth is normal additional spending in Maine stores, he added.
"We were really shocked at how strong January sales were given the type of weather we had," Allen said. "I guess if you are not going out to the mall, you might be sitting at the house in front of the fire with a laptop and buying stuff. People aren't necessarily cutting back on the spending, just doing it in a different way."
The surge of lodging sales during the darkest days of the winter indicates new revenue from online home-sharing sites, which are overshadowed by other accommodation outlets during the summer, fall and holiday seasons, Allen added.
"It will really change the way we need to start thinking about monthly sales when we think about that industry," he said. "As we do this year-over-year comparison, businesses that were not previously in our system and now are are driving that growth."
Online shoppers for years dodged state and local sales tax because under federal law, retailers do not have to collect taxes unless they have a physical presence, or nexus, in a state such as a store or a warehouse.
But pressure has built on companies to collect those taxes. A South Dakota lawsuit seeking to overturn the law governing remote sales is being considered by the U.S. Supreme Court.
Last April, online giant Amazon started to collect Maine's 5.5 percent sales tax. At the same time, home-sharing platform Airbnb began charging guests the state's 9 percent lodging tax.
A number of other online retailers have elected to charge Maine sales tax. But the state doesn't have the ability to track how many online retailers have registered with the state, and the identity of companies that are voluntarily collecting tax is confidential, said David Heidrich, spokesman for the Department of Administrative and Financial Services. Shoe retailer Zappos and pet supplies outlet Chewy.com both say they collect taxes in Maine.
Precisely what impact taxable online sales have on the state's bottom line is unclear because they are lumped in with sales from brick-and-mortar retailers. However, increased lodging sales and purchases of specialty products and general merchandise netted the state close to $4.6 million in extra revenue in the first two months of 2018 compared to the same time last year. In fiscal year 2017, $1.4 billion was collected from all sales and use taxes.
Many online retailers do not collect tax in Maine, which costs the state up to $20 million a year in lost revenue, according to Allen. Merchandise sales are a small portion of the state's overall sales tax revenue, especially compared to automobile and building material sales, he added.
"We have to give credit to the companies that choose to comply with the law of the land and are accurately reporting sales tax to the state," said Curtis Picard, president and CEO of the Retail Association of Maine.
The association, like the National Retail Federation, has fought for years to make online companies pay sales tax, arguing current laws unfairly disadvantage brick-and-mortar stores. Last year, Maine lawmakers passed a law drafted by the association to force remote sellers with more than $100,000 in sales or 200 transactions a year to collect state tax. The law was identical to the South Dakota measure that prompted the current Supreme Court case. It also pressured online sellers to begin collecting taxes, Picard said, adding that states could decide to come after companies for uncollected back taxes depending on the Supreme Court ruling.
"This isn't an issue of if they collect, it is when," he said. "Certain companies don't want to be part of that issue, so they are being proactive and that is great."
Amazon, Zappos and Chewy did not respond to emails asking if the new law influenced their decision to begin collecting taxes.
Under current law, consumers, not retailers, are required to pay sales tax, but most do not. Maine residents are supposed to pay a 5.5 percent "use tax" for out-of-state purchases on their income tax filing. But only 8 percent of tax filings reflected that tax in 2016, accounting for about $3.6 million in revenue, according to the state.
"The burden has always been on the consumer to self-report that tax, and everyone knows most people don't report that," Picard said. "It shouldn't be on you or me to pay that tax just because we shop online."

Texto completo: STANDISH -- Melodie Bailey drove home a pair of runs in each game and also scored in each as St. Joseph's College ended its softball regular season Sunday with a doubleheader sweep against Albertus Magnus, 9-1 and 6-2.
The Monks (18-17, 14-9 GNAC) won the opener in five innings. Bailey singled home two runs and scored to highlight a six-run second inning that gave St. Joseph's a 9-1 lead. Madeline Wood added a two-run double during the big inning.

Texto completo: CUMBERLAND -- The Town Council voted 6-1 last week to work with ReVision Energy on potential installation of a solar farm to meet most of the town's electricity needs.
The array would be built atop a capped landfill on Drowne Road.
The panel authorized its Finance Committee to negotiate a power purchase agreement with ReVision. The agreement must return to the council for full approval, which could happen May 14.
No public comment was taken at the council's meeting last week, which riled several audience members who live at the nearby Village Green housing development. The neighbors have concerns about the visual impact of a solar farm, as well as adverse effects on their property values.
But Council Chairman Mike Edes assured residents they will have the opportunity to speak when the agreement comes before the council for consideration.
"Nothing is sealed yet," Councilor Bill Stiles told the audience. "We're still looking at it, looking at where it would be positioned, looking at possible screening."
Councilor Tom Gruber, who voted against the motion, said he supports solar panels and the goal of reducing carbon footprints. "The issue is the location," he said.
Gruber confirmed with Denny Gallaudet of the Cumberland Climate Action Team that no other locations had been considered for the solar panel.
"The landfill makes really a lot of common sense, because it's not really usable for anything else" and there is flexibility for how the array is positioned, Gallaudet said. But he noted that "all we need is 4 acres somewhere in town; that's the footprint."
Concerns about the solar array come as neighbors have criticized the town for not moving forward with plans to relocate the nearby public works garage, salt shed and school bus building. Space has become tight at those facilities, and relocation would facilitate more housing development, placing the land on the tax rolls.
Cumberland officials have eyed vacant town-owned land bordered by Tuttle Road and the Town Forest, as well as a piece of Cumberland Fairgrounds property, as relocation sites, but both plans have stalled. Councilor Peter Bingham said that no one wants such a facility near where they live.
A neighborhood meeting on the relocation of Public Works is scheduled for 6 p.m. Monday, May 14, at Town Hall.
"The neighborhood increasingly feels, sounds and looks like an industrial complex with decisions made by the town that blatantly disfavor Village Green and renege on previous agreements," Katherine Pelletreau of Drowne Road wrote April 22, criticizing the fact that Public Works has yet to move and the Village Green development has yet to be fully implemented.
"Meeting the town's energy needs through alternative sources of power such as solar makes sense," she wrote, "but there are lots of better spaces in Cumberland - Twin Brooks or the roofs of the new fire station or school buildings, for example - better suited to this project that wouldn't pose risks to resident housing values and aesthetics the way the current proposal does."
Dennis and Mary Chick of Wyman Way noted that locating on a landfill "appears to be a good choice for South Portland and Belfast, but these locations are not adjacent to planned subdivisions or neighborhoods. They are located out of sight."
Councilor George Turner cautioned residents against assuming their property values would be compromised by a nearby solar array.
"I can assure you that we don't have any desire to diminish anybody's values, because that's where revenues come from, and that's where taxes are paid," he said. "As this process goes forward, I think this council in general is going to be very careful to do all it can, if indeed this site ends up being the site, to protect you from any adverse effect of the project."
ReVision proposes building a $1.1 million array, with 1,376 panels that generate about 617,000 kilowatt-hours annually. To take advantage of federal renewable-energy tax credits and reduce expenses, the array would be sold through a power purchase agreement to an outside investor.
When the tax credits expire in about six years, the town could purchase the array for about $663,000, according to ReVision's proposal. The municipality could then have free electricity for the life of the array, which could be 40 years. The town could save $2.4 million as a result, Cumberland Climate Action Team member Eric Fitz said in February.
The town spends about $120,000 each year on electricity, including about $70,000-$80,000 for nine municipal properties that include Town Hall, the Val Halla Golf & Recreation Center, Central Fire Station, public works garage and Prince Memorial Library, according to a presentation prepared this year by Cumberland Climate Action Team members Jane Wilson, Gallaudet and Fitz.
Those properties consume roughly 650,000 kilowatt-hours each year - 80 percent of the municipal government's total energy consumption. Maine Public Utilities Commission regulations for distributed solar energy currently limit municipalities to 10 meters, or accounts, that use energy from solar arrays, Gallaudet said.
