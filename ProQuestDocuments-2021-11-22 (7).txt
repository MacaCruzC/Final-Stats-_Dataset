Texto completo: Music, movies, television, theater, art and dance: Here's who broke away from the pack this year.
Daring, defiant and unwilling to be watered down, the stars who closed out the year on top shared a similar mentality: break rules, break through. Here are 14 artists from across the board who shook up their scenes.
Billie Eilish, Lil Nas X, Lizzo, Rosalía
The new pop music superstars of 2019 didn't need to adhere to the industry's long-held (and fast-aging) trajectory to be anointed as such. They were perfectly motivated to carve out a fresh path, detouring around some of the existing gates and the old one-size-fits-all guard, to head straight for their audiences.
Masters of self-marketing that were relative unknowns before 2019, these four artists -- Lizzo, 31; Lil Nas X, 20; Billie Eilish, 18; and Rosalía, 26 -- leveraged social media platforms to broadcast their talent and larger-than-life personalities, and somehow managed to come across wholly authentic at the same time. The result: billions of streams, millions of devoted fans, sold-out concerts, Grammy nominations and many records broken.
Helping to facilitate their rise was the widespread adoption of streaming, allowing listeners to seek out the music they want, leading them to artists -- diverse in appearance, race and ethnicity -- who might have been considered too unconventional for the mainstream not long ago.

Phoebe Waller-Bridge
Phoebe Waller-Bridge, the British actress, writer and producer, owned 2019 by not trying to be a hero to anyone. Plot twist: She became a hero to so many, especially women.
"It's just really wonderful to know, and reassuring, that a dirty, pervy, angry, messed up woman can make it to the Emmys," Waller-Bridge, 34, said onstage in September, accepting the first of three Emmys that night for her cutting, filter-free tragicomedy "Fleabag," which began in 2013 as a one-woman show. (She was nominated for a fourth Emmy, for outstanding drama series for the spy thriller "Killing Eve," which she helped write and create.)
What's next? "I feel like I might scale up a bit," she recently told Vogue. "I feel maybe I want to start thinking more politically, more globally. I don't know, but I can feel something bubbling."
Taylor Russell
The name Taylor Russell might not be a household one just yet, but after watching her breakthrough performance in Trey Edward Shults's domestic melodrama "Waves," you may never forget her.
Midway through "Waves," about a black Florida family that endures a cataclysmic tragedy, the film's weight shifts onto the shoulders of Emily, a stoic teenage girl played by Russell, 25. In a review of the movie in The New York Times, Manohla Dargis, the co-chief film critic, called Russell "an open-faced heartbreaker." Russell connected with Emily as soon as she read a scene from the movie, she told Elle magazine last month. "I know her, I know this girl," she remembered thinking to herself. "What I love about 'Waves' is the message of healing," Russell said, "and that nobody's perfect."
Jeremy O. Harris
In the most daring Broadway debut this year, Jeremy O. Harris pushed boundaries with "Slave Play," a show about "antebellum sexual performance therapy" that offers sexual content warnings and unflinchingly takes on the traumatizing legacy of slavery on black Americans. "It is new territory for everyone," Harris recently told The New York Times. "You have to be ready for the conversation."
Both Ben Brantley and Jesse Green, the theater critics of The Times, named the production as among the best theater of the year.
Of the success of "Slave Play," Harris, 30, said: "I'm really excited that this gets to happen for a black queer person, because it's creating a new conversation about how big we can imagine."

Heji Shin
"I knew people would hate this exhibition," Heji Shin told Artnet News in January.
Shin, a German-Korean photographer born in 1976, was talking about her massive portraits of Kanye West (if you're drawing parallels between the size of these prints and his much discussed ego, you won't be the first). When she shot West, she wasn't "particularly interested in his comments on slavery, if he liked Trump, or if he did his incoherent tweets," Shin said. "But it changed quickly when I saw people getting really mad."
Two of the Kanye portraits and five pieces from her 2016 "Babies" series were among the most talked-about works in the 2019 Whitney Biennial. "Babies" -- striking shots of newborns as they crown from their mothers' vaginas -- was also among 25 works of art that defined the contemporary age, according to The New York Times Style Magazine.
"Her photographs do not answer any questions," the article said. "Instead, they ask a lot of their audiences."

Jharrel Jerome
At only 22 years old, Jharrel Jerome has awed critics and audiences. In 2016, he starred in the best movie Oscar winner, "Moonlight." This year, in the Ava DuVernay Netflix mini-series "When They See Us," his wrenching, emotionally complex portrayal of a teenage boy wrongly convicted of a brutal attack earned him a best actor Emmy and quite likely secured his future in Hollywood.
While researching the role, Jerome bonded deeply with the man he portrayed in the series: Korey Wise, who was exonerated in 2002 after the confession of another man.
"I've learned that it's our job as artists to go beyond what we think is O.K. for a film," Jerome told The Times. "I think it's good to step out the box, and tell stories that challenge the heart and the mind."
Lise Davidsen
Lise Davidsen didn't even see an opera until she was in her 20s. Last month, at 32, she made her debut at the Metropolitan Opera in Tchaikovsky's "The Queen of Spades" -- "gaining a reputation as the great Wagnerian promise of her generation," as The Times put it.
"It's a one-in-a-million voice," the conductor Antonio Pappano said of Davidsen, a soprano.
The show comes on the heels of her first major-label album and her acclaimed debut at the Bayreuth Festival in Germany over the summer. The Met wasted no time casting her in several shows over the next three seasons.
In November, Davidsen told The Times that she had long grappled with fears of inadequacy. "I was constantly afraid," she said, "and in a way that made me work so hard, that I could be where I am today."
Ayodele Casel
"I want to create more experiences of joy for myself -- it's all that I'm craving right now," the tap dancer Ayodele Casel recently told Gia Kourlas, The Times dance critic.
Casel, above center, has been in the field for more than 20 years and inspires people to describe her with words like illuminating, electric, mesmerizing -- as Aaron Mattocks, director of programming at the Joyce Theater in New York, put it. It was about time that Casel, 44, got her due, Kourlas wrote.
Casel's collaboration with the composer Arturo O'Farrill at the Joyce this year earned her that. The performance was a spectacular display of technique and heart, skill and spirit, Kourlas wrote. And there was history too, as Casel paid homage to the female tap dancers who came before her.

Ali Stroker
When Ali Stroker accepted her Tony Award in June for her turn as Ado Annie in "Oklahoma!," she made history as the first person who uses a wheelchair to win a Tony. "This award is for every kid who is watching tonight who has a disability, who has a limitation or a challenge," she said in her acceptance speech.
Stroker, 32, who lost the use of her legs in a car accident when she was 2 years old, has been active in theater since she was 7, when she played the titular character in her neighbor's production of "Annie."
Before her win, Stroker talked to The Times about what keeps her motivated in an industry where people with disabilities are not represented. "I'm very aware that when I was a little girl I wasn't seeing anybody like me, and on days when I'm exhausted or discouraged about something, that lights a fire."
Michael Armitage
When the new, expanded Museum of Modern Art debuted in October, it devoted a ground-floor gallery to the large-scale narrative paintings of Michael Armitage in partnership with the Studio Museum -- just another high point in a year of achievements for the 35-year-old Kenyan-born, London-based painter who focuses on global social and political issues. The paintings explore, in his words, "parallel cultural histories," as modernism breaks with Western traditions.
Starting in May, several of his works were displayed at the prestigious 2019 Venice Biennale.
And, his auction debut in November was remarkable. His 2015 painting on bark cloth, "The Conservationists," was expected to sell for between $ 50,000 and $ 70,000. The sale blew those estimates to smithereens. It went for $ 1.52 million.
"An artist's role is defined by the artist and how they wish to live and express themselves," he told Studio magazine last year. "There is no set role for artists."
Mira Nadon
Mira Nadon -- with a feline, self-assured beauty and an undulating flow -- "is a ballerina, capital B," Kourlas wrote after seeing Nadon, 18, above center, in her dazzling debut in George Balanchine's "Rubies" this fall. On Instagram, she called her first week of rehearsals "fun and fulfilling."
Before that, Nadon, who began her ballet training at the age of 6 and was a student at the School of American Ballet, also triumphed as the female lead in Balanchine's "Scotch Symphony" at the annual Workshop Performances, Kourlas wrote in May.
Nadon doesn't worry about playing it safe, exuding qualities that can't be taught, according to Kourlas, who wrote that her "Rubies" debut wasn't just a good show, but "a promise to the future."

'Racist hypothesis': New York Times corrects Bret Stephens column on 'Jewish Genius’

Autor: Brest, Mike.

Texto completo: The New York Times issued an editor's note to Bret Stephens's recent column explaining that it removed a section where the writer cited a study that was conducted by someone with white nationalist ties.
Stephens's Friday column, headlined "The Secrets of Jewish Genius," asked how Ashkenazi Jews were able to contribute so much to society despite there being such a small Jewish population worldwide. Stephens, who briefly left Twitter this fall after being called a "bedbug," argued that Ashkenazi Jews, or Jewish people who are from Europe, "are, or tend to be, smart."
He then cited a 2005 study that determined that Ashkenazi Jews have a higher average IQ over other ethnic groups. One of the authors of the study is Henry Harpending, who was identified as having "promoted racist views." The New York Times removed the part of the column referencing Harpending's study after being criticized on social media.
The editor's note reads: "An earlier version of this Bret Stephens column quoted statistics from a 2005 paper that advanced a genetic hypothesis for the basis of intelligence among Ashkenazi Jews. After publication Mr. Stephens and his editors learned that one of the paper’s authors, who died in 2016, promoted racist views. Mr. Stephens was not endorsing the study or its authors’ views, but it was a mistake to cite it uncritically. The effect was to leave an impression with many readers that Mr. Stephens was arguing that Jews are genetically superior."
Tweet
"That was not his intent," it continues. "He went on instead to argue that culture and history are crucial factors in Jewish achievements and that, as he put it, 'At its best, the West can honor the principle of racial, religious and ethnic pluralism not as a grudging accommodation to strangers but as an affirmation of its own diverse identity. In that sense, what makes Jews special is that they aren’t. They are representational.' We have removed reference to the study from the column."
The column was published amid an increase in anti-Semitic attacks in New York this month. Over the weekend, Grafton Thomas, 38, broke into the home of a rabbi and injured five with a machete. He was charged Sunday morning with five counts of attempted murder and one count of burglary. Friends of the attacker said he had a history of mental illness.

Our culture of apathy has normalized anti-Semitism

Autor: McGhee, Kaylee.

Texto completo: As dozens of Jewish New Yorkers gathered in Rabbi Chaim Rottenberg’s home to celebrate the seventh day of Hanukkah, a passerby spotted the Menorah, stopped, and walked toward the front door.

Worshipers had begun to filter into the synagogue next door for a holiday meal as 37-year-old Grafton Thomas barged into the home, pulled out a knife that looked “almost like a broomstick,” closed the door behind him, and said, “Nobody's going anywhere.”
He began to stab and slice at “everyone he could,” leaving one victim with wounds to the head, neck, back, and arm, and injuring four others. He then tried to enter the synagogue next door, but the congregants had heard the commotion next door and locked him out. Thomas fled the scene, and police later found him with stains on his clothes, smelling of bleach, blood, and hate.
The attack lasted only two minutes, but it was brutal and all too familiar to New York’s Jewish community — a people that now live in fear on the streets they once claimed as their own. Saturday’s attack was the ninth that week.
And each one of the individual attacks bears certain similarities: the victims are almost always Hasidic or Orthodox Jews, the attacks are seemingly random, and the attackers' motivations are labeled “unclear,” just as Thomas’s were.

But Thomas’s motivations weren’t “unclear” at all, and his attack wasn’t random. He saw the Menorah and chose to enter that home and kill as many Jews as he could, simply because they were Jewish. It’s likely he had intended to attack the Jewish community at some point that night. He was carrying around a machete, for goodness sake.

For those unfamiliar with the history of anti-Semitism, Thomas’s attack might indeed seem random and even strange. Why would a man enter a Jewish home unprovoked just to kill? Why would a group of teenagers randomly beat a 65-year-old Jewish man and his 6-year-old son? Why would a crowd of spectators laugh as a young man poured his drink on a 25-year-old Jew in Brooklyn? Why would a woman begin hitting a 34-year-old Jewish mother with her purse as her children watched?

The frustrating thing about anti-Semitism is that it has no explanation. It makes no sense. We can't just explain it away, attribute it to a particular group, person, or political party, and look the other way. Anti-Semitism can't be fit into a box or tied to an ideology because it predates ideology, race, political structure, and just about every other hatred that has ever plagued this world.
Anti-Semitism tends to be more common among the extreme Left and Right. But that's because radicals on both sides of the political spectrum are simply taking advantage of a historical, and often socially acceptable, hatred. Just look at the situation in Europe. The shame of the Holocaust created a temporary reprieve, but now virulent hatred of Jews is once again common. No one blinked an eye when Italians protesting Gaza called for a boycott of Jewish merchants. Or when a popular French comedian introduced a new kind of Nazi salute. Or when a rabbi and his three children were murdered in their home in France. As of last month, about 1 in 3 Europeans admitted to holding some sort of anti-Semitic opinion.
Here in the United States, it seemed like we had rid ourselves of Europe’s hatred. But Thomas’s attack, and the dozens that occurred before it, are a painful reminder that we have not, and we will not until we admit what we’ve done to foster it.

We have created a political culture of apathy. Anti-Semites such as Al Sharpton and Louis Farrakhan have become normalized — so normalized, in fact, that prominent politicians and presidential hopefuls meet with Sharpton to seek his blessing.
Anti-Zionism and visceral hatred for Israel — one of the last Jewish safe havens in the world — is normal and often expected on the Left, especially on today’s college campuses. Anti-Zionism is not the same as anti-Semitism, but the two go together so well that the adherents of one usually can't pass it up. Anti-Semitic tropes are casually thrown around on college campuses, not just in alt-right online circles. In the very halls of Congress, they are declaimed by elected representatives of the people. And simple gestures — such as President Trump’s recent executive order extending civil rights protections to Jewish college students — are condemned as unnecessary, misplaced, and (get this) anti-Semitic.

I doubt that any of the factors I just named inspired or caused Thomas to enter a Rabbi’s home and stab five people. But it is a reminder that our words, actions, and policies create a context in which anti-Semitic rhetoric and violence find justification.

There will always be individuals looking for an excuse to hate, and unfortunately, Jews are often the target. Sometimes it is because of their ethnicity, culture, or faith, but oftentimes it is because “in the eyes of the anti-Semite, the Jew is … everything” and anything the “anti-Semite needs him to be,” as New York Times columnist Bari Weiss writes in her book How to Fight Anti-Semitism.
Anti-Semitism exists in part because we allow it to — because we read about these attacks, offer a few sympathetic remarks, and then return to life as normal. The media, too, has ignored this issue, as my colleague Seth Mandel pointed out on Twitter. And as a result, anti-Semitism has slowly become normal.
It is an old hatred, perhaps the oldest, and it cannot be allowed to spread any further. New York used to be safe; now, it is not. And it is incumbent upon each of us to stigmatize anti-Semitism, to reject it, and to create a culture that refuses to accept it in all of its forms.
This problem extends far past the Jewish community, and if we do not act now, it will leave a dark stain on our nation for years to come.

Texto completo: WHITE SETTLEMENT, Texas -- Congregants returned fire and fatally shot a gunman who killed at least one person in a church near Fort Worth, Texas, on Sunday, police said.

A second parishioner has life-threatening injuries following the attack at the West Freeway Church of Christ, White Settlement Police Department Chief J.P. Bevering said during a news conference Sunday afternoon.

The assailant fired at least once before the "heroic actions" of the congregants cut his assault short, Bevering said.

"Unfortunately, this country has seen so many of these that we've actually gotten used to it at this point. And it's tragic and it's a terrible situation, especially during the holiday season," Jeoff Williams, a regional director with the Texas Department of Public Safety, said at the news conference. "I would like to point out that we have a couple of heroic parishioners who stopped short of just anything that you can even imagine, saved countless lives, and our hearts are going out to them and their families as well."

Authorities have released scant details about the victims, the shooter and what led to the attack.

An elder at the church told the New York Times that one of those killed was a security guard who responded to the shooter, calling him a dear friend.

"He was trying to do what he needed to do to protect the rest of us," said the elder, Mike Tinius.

"It's extremely upsetting to see anyone committing violence," he said.

Tinius said he didn't know the gunman and that the shooting appeared to be random.

A woman who answered the phone at the West Freeway Church of Christ told the AP she could not answer any questions and that she was told to direct inquiries to authorities.

In a livestream of the church service, the gunman can be seen getting up from a pew and talking to someone at the back of the church before pulling out a gun and opening fire. Parishioners can then be heard screaming and seen ducking under pews or running as papers fly to the floor.

More than 100 people, including children, can be seen sitting in the pews from the livestream's viewpoint.

Two people with minor injuries sustained while ducking for cover were treated at the scene, MedStar Mobile Healthcare spokeswoman Macara Trusty said.

Gov. Greg Abbott asked the state to pray for the victims, their loved ones and the community of White Settlement, about 8 miles (12 kilometers) west of Fort Worth.

"Places of worship are meant to be sacred, and I am grateful for the church members who acted quickly to take down the shooter and help prevent further loss of life," Abbott said in a tweeted statement.

It is not the first deadly shooting to take place at a church in Texas. In November 2017, Devin Patrick Kelley opened fire on the congregation at a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, killing more than two dozen worshippers, before taking his own life.

Texto completo: WHITE SETTLEMENT, Texas >> A man pulled out a shotgun at a Texas church service and fired on worshippers Sunday, killing two people before he was shot to death by congregants who fired back, police said.
Authorities at a Sunday evening news conference praised the two congregants who opened fire as part of a volunteer security team at West Freeway Church of Christ in White Settlement. It was unclear if the two people who were killed were the two who shot at the gunman.
"This team responded quickly and within six seconds, the shooting was over. Two of the parishioners who were volunteers of the security force drew their weapons and took out the killer immediately, saving untold number of lives," said Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who also hailed the state's gun laws.
Britt Farmer, senior minister of the church, said, "We lost two great men today, but it could have been a lot worse."
Authorities said there were more than 240 parishioners in the West Freeway Church at the time of the shooting.
White Settlement Police Department Chief J.P. Bevering said the gunman had sat down in a pew before getting up, taking out a shotgun and firing at a parishioner, who was killed. He said the church's security team then "eliminated the threat."
Officials have not released the names of the victims or the gunman. FBI Special Agent in Charge Matthew DeSarno said they're working to identify the gunman's motive, adding that he is "relatively transient" but had roots in the area.
DeSarno also said the gunman had been arrested multiple times in the past but declined to give details.
An elder at the church told the New York Times that one of those killed was a security guard who responded to the shooter, calling him a dear friend.
"He was trying to do what he needed to do to protect the rest of us," said the elder, Mike Tinius.
"It's extremely upsetting to see anyone committing violence," he said.
Tinius said he didn't know the gunman and that the shooting appeared to be random.
A woman who answered the phone at the West Freeway Church of Christ told the AP she could not answer any questions and that she was told to direct inquiries to authorities.
In a livestream of the church service, the gunman can be seen getting up from a pew and talking to someone at the back of the church before pulling out a gun and opening fire. Parishioners can then be heard screaming and seen ducking under pews or running as papers fly to the floor.

It is not the first deadly shooting to take place at a church in Texas. In November 2017, Devin Patrick Kelley opened fire on the congregation at a church in Sutherland Springs, killing more than two dozen worshippers, before taking his own life. And in 1999, a gunman killed seven people in Wedgwood Baptist Church in Fort Worth before detonating an explosive device and killing himself.

Texto completo: The Times is committed to correcting our mistakes, whether we mixed up Jimmy Fallon and Jimmy Kimmel or grossly (really, grossly) overestimated the number of bacteria on a toilet seat.
Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
Each day of 2019, the journalists of The New York Times strove to bring readers information about the world clearly, concisely and -- most important of all -- correctly.
Sometimes, we missed the mark.
When The Times makes a mistake, we publish a correction. It's more than a procedural obligation: According to our style guide, it's "an ethical responsibility."
Errors were often tiny: a missed letter here, a date off by a digit there. But other corrections left us red-faced -- and left readers chuckling. Here are some of our most notable corrections of 2019.

One of the very first corrections of the year proved a single letter can make a world of difference in meaning.
An earlier version of this article misstated the name of an organization that has documented a crackdown on journalists in Saudi Arabia. It is the Committee to Protect Journalists, not the Committee to Project Journalists.
So did one later in the year -- although you can probably guess why the writer had horses in mind.
An earlier version of this briefing misstated the name of the Kentucky Derby winner. It is Country House, not Country Horse.
Another single-letter correction scrambled President Trump's family tree.
Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated the given name of President Trump's first wife. It is Ivana, not Ivanka.
Some corrections might have made a reader wonder how on earth the miscommunication happened in the first place.
An earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to the Quran that Representative Rashida Tlaib used for her ceremonial oath of office. She was sworn in using a Quran that was given to her by a friend, not one that belonged to Thomas Jefferson.
An earlier version of this article misidentified the subject of a sculpture by Jonathan Lyndon Chase. It is of a plastic bag, not a toilet seat.
It's widely understood that journalists aren't arithmetic experts; many times this year, just like every year, we confused "millions" for "billions" or vice versa. But on one occasion, we forgot to say either one, and painted a rather stingy picture of wildfire recovery efforts:
Because of an editing error, an earlier version of a capsule summary with this article misstated the size of a fund proposed by Gov. Gavin Newsom to help victims of California wildfires. As the article correctly noted, it would be $ 21 billion, not $ 21.
On the other hand, we also added a "million" where one didn't belong -- much to the relief of readers of this correction.
Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated the number of bacteria per square inch on the average toilet seat. It is about 50, not about 50 million.
Those weren't the only instances that toyed with our sense of scale.
An earlier version of this article misstated the amount of sodium in a large egg. It is 71 milligrams, not 71 grams.
For reference, there are about 71 grams of sodium in about two-thirds of a cup of pure table salt.
On several occasions, we also mischaracterized party details, presumably to the chagrin of those present -- starting with a report from the Playboy Club.
An earlier version of this article misidentified the person who introduced the Bunnies and misattributed comments made during the evening. While Brandon James Gwinn, the evening's music director, shared hosting duties with the vocalist Anne Fraser Thomas, he did not introduce the Bunnies nor did he suggest that a conga line might be forming and urge people to take pictures.
An earlier version of this article misstated the location of a pride parade in which James Schwartz, a former member of an Amish community, participated. It was in Lansing, Mich., not Grand Rapids. It also misstated the vehicle Mr. Schwartz rode in during the parade. It was a convertible, not a horse and buggy.
An earlier version of this article incorrectly described Peter Shire's holiday open house. He will not be cooking food for attendees.
That last correction was made two days before Thanksgiving -- hopefully giving Mr. Shire's guests enough notice to adjust their expectations.
We misrepresented Burger King's buns.
An earlier version of this article misstated the kind of seeds on Whopper buns. They are sesame seeds, not poppy seeds.
And called into question a particular historic episode of shoe-banging.
An earlier version of this briefing said that the widely remembered story about the Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev banging his shoe during a 1960 address at the U.N. probably didn't happen. Although a biographer of Khrushchev has questioned details of the episode, numerous news outlets, including The Times, reported that Khrushchev did bang his shoe.

We were visited this year, in February, by the curse of the late-night Jimmy mix-up.
Because of an editing error, an earlier version of a picture caption with this article misidentified the person in the photograph. He is Jimmy Kimmel, not Jimmy Fallon.
And again in November, when turnabout was fair play.
An earlier version of this briefing misattributed a joke in the item on late-night comedy. The line about daylight saving time giving people an extra hour to boo at a sporting event was Jimmy Fallon's, not Jimmy Kimmel's (though he had some zingers too).
The Jimmys weren't our only consequential misattributions this year:
A previous version of this story misstated the origin of a quote that the historian Ron Chernow shared during his remarks at the White House Correspondents' Association dinner. While Mr. Chernow attributed the remark to Mark Twain, there is no evidence that Twain ever said, "Politicians and diapers must be changed often, and for the same reason."
An earlier version of this article misattributed a quotation. The lines, "We don't read and write poetry because it's cute. We read and write poetry because we are members of the human race," were said by a character in the movie "Dead Poets Society," not by Walt Whitman.
An earlier version of this article misattributed a quotation about whom Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor takes after. It was Meghan, Duchess of Sussex -- not Prince Harry -- who said, "We're still trying to figure that out."
Apparently, so were we.

Finally, special mention must be made of this Jan. 29 correction from T Magazine, which at 189 words was more than half as long as the 336-word blurb it corrected.
An earlier version of "The Perfect Fisherman's Coat," the first item above, had multiple errors. The article misidentified the founders of Kassl Editions; they are Ilse Cornelissens, Tim Van Geloven, Bart Ramakers, Charlotte Schreuder and Christian Salez, not a 10-person team including Gijsje Ribbens and Merel van den Bergh. The article also misidentified when the brand was launched; it was last June, not September. The article referred incorrectly to the coat styles that Kassl offers. All Kassl coats have the same basic silhouette; there is not one new silhouette per collection. It also referred incorrectly to the frequency of new editions; there are a few editions per year, released at irregular intervals, not a new edition every three months. The article misspelled the given name of one of Kassl's founders; she is Ilse Cornelissens, not Isle. It also misspelled the name of a concept store in Antwerp; it is Graanmarkt 13, not Granmaarkt. And it mischaracterized Cornelissens's role in the founding of Graanmarkt 13; she was the store's co-founder, not its founder. Finally, the article misspelled the German city that is the brand's namesake; it is Kassel, not Kassl.
As we bid 2019 -- and all its mistakes -- farewell, here's to accuracy (and, in its absence, good humor) in the new year.

Texto completo: Sweet, savory, sentimental, sad, silly, and even star-studded stories spiced up the food world in 2019.

Here, in no particular order, is a tasting menu of 10 top tidbits.

For one night only

World-renowned chefs and restaurateurs Thomas Keller and Daniel Boulud visited the Culinary Vegetable Institute at The Chef's Garden in Milan, Ohio, in September. They were hosts of a fund-raiser to support Team USA in the prestigious Bocuse d'Or, a biennial, international culinary competition.

Chefs from Texas, New York City, and Cleveland, as well as the United States' only gold medal Bocuse d'Or winner - Mathew Peters in 2017 - prepared an illustrious six-course meal.

One man in attendance suggested that there would be more stars at that dinner than there are stars in the sky.

The event raised money to support culinary scholarships and future Bocuse d'Or competitors. Chefs Jeffery Hayashi and his assistant, William Barrera, will represent the United States in January, 2021.



Beard buzz

For the fourth year in a row, the prestigious James Beard Foundation Awards only named Chicago chefs as finalists in the Best Chef: Great Lakes category, despite this being a four-state region encompassing Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, and the rest of Illinois.

In better Beard news, Washington, D.C.-based former Top Chef contender Kwame Onwuachi was named Rising Star Chef of the Year at the Beard Foundation's annual awards ceremony in May.

The previous month, he had published his autobiography, Notes From a Young Black Chef. A searing story, it forced the culinary world - especially some of the world's most exclusive restaurants - to face accusations of institutional racism.

In accepting his Beard award, Mr. Onwuachi pointed out: Fifty-four years ago was when the last restaurant was integrated and Jim Crow was lifted. And here I am, my ancestors' wildest dreams.

Downtown dining

Beloved PJ's Deli closed in June, when owner Polly Vallade decided, after 40 years, that it was time for a well-earned retirement. Biggby Coffee also closed, as did Subway and the Potbelly Sandwich Shop.

While Bleak House Coffee closed its Adams Street site, it reinvented itself as Curious Cat Coffee on Bancroft Street, near the University of Toledo. (Note that it is not a cat cafÃ© with frolicking felines waiting to be adopted.)

But in April, Coney Island Hot Dog Downtown Toledo celebrated its 100th anniversary with a party so popular that the staff had to close early when they ran out of the special $1 coneys.

As for newcomers, in October the downtown area welcomed Deet's BBQ and Brew, its first location with a liquor license and a full bar.

And on Dec. 2, the city's first all-vegan restaurant, The Leaf and Seed, opened in the Davis Building.

The loss of luminaries

Three of the most respected women in the food world died within a two-week period in June: 96 year old Leah Chase; Maida Heatter, at 102; and Molly O'Neill, who was only 66.

Mrs. Chase, of the famed Dooky Chase's restaurant, was a vital part of New Orleans' culinary scene. She hosted civil rights leaders, and once even chastised former President Barack Obama for putting hot sauce in her gumbo.

Ms. Heatter, a noted pastry chef nicknamed the Queen of Cake, had published a collection of her favorite recipes, Happiness is Baking, just a few weeks before she passed away.

And Ms. O'Neill published cookbooks and wrote for The New York Times, in addition to teaching and holding retreats to nurture the next generation of food writers.

Romaine recall, version 2.0

In what is becoming a new Thanksgiving tradition, it was dÃ©ja vu all over again when romaine lettuce was recalled in late November because of E. coli contamination.

According to the United States Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service, products from Salinas, CA, were at risk. So once again, as also happened during the 2018 holiday season, store shelves were cleared of the offending products.

But lettuce hasn't been the only food on the naughty list: Hard-boiled eggs, frozen sausage breakfast burritos, flour, chicken pies, pork, and ground beef all joined the poisonous party. The various reasons for these recalls ranged from risks of listeria to foreign matter found in the foods, failure to list allergens, and salmonella.

And that's not all: In mid-July, the City Grill closed its doors temporarily for a thorough cleaning after a less-than-stellar inspection.

Both of Toledo's Steak 'n' Shake locations had their operating licenses suspended by the Toledo-Lucas County Health Department, having been deemed immediate threat[s] to public health. The one at 2141 S. Reynolds Rd. has re-opened, while the Monroe St. site has closed.

Winner winner, chicken sandwich

Chicken. Brioche. Pickles. New. Sandwich. Popeyes. Nationwide. So. Good. Forgot. How. Speak. In. Complete. Sandwiches. I mean, sentences.

That's what Popeyes Chicken tweeted on August 12.

The introduction of its chicken sandwich created such a demand that the company had to declare a lack of supply only two weeks later.

But as it teased Chick-fil-A, the former fan favorite, about its success on social media, all was not fun and games: a fight began at a Maryland Popeyes when one man was stabbed to death after accusations of cutting in line to get the popular poultry.

Fast food nation

The Clemson University Tigers won the College Football National Championship in January, beating the Alabama Crimson Tide.

That prompted an invitation from the White House, to celebrate the success.

Unfortunately, this was during the 35-day government shutdown. So, with staff having been furloughed, who was going to provide food for the festivities?

President Donald Trump.

Because of the shutdown, you know we have the great Clemson team with us, the national champions. So we went out and we ordered American fast food, paid for by me, Mr. Trump said. Lots of hamburgers, lots of pizza ... great American food, he added.

It was all served in style on silver trays, complete with the cachet of cardboard boxes and paper wrappers.

Aw, SNAP

The Trump administration has proposed new rules and regulations regarding SNAP: the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program that helps to combat food insufficiency for those who live in poverty.

A study by the Urban Institute analyzed the potential ramifications of the revised unemployment standards and work requirements necessary to qualify for benefits, using 2018 SNAP Quality Control data.

The report says that had the new terms been implemented, the average monthly number of participating households would have fallen by 2.1 million .... Nearly a quarter of households without children, elderly, or members with disabilities would lose eligibility. Twelve percent of households with elderly members would lose eligibility as would 7 percent of households with children.

If enacted, sixteen percent of households would receive lower benefits, though 13 percent could potentially receive an extra $14 per month.

Applause to the Claws

Spiked seltzer has become a singular sensation, in the tradition of hard lemonade, root beer, and orange soda, as well as the former phenomenon that is La Croix sparkling water. The fun, fizzy fruity drink offers a bit of a buzz with about 5 percent alcohol by volume.

Its popularity has soared, with sales increasing by 200 percent in 2019. Wine Enthusiast magazine reports that, by 2021, some analysts predict hard seltzer could be a $2.5 billion industry.

White Claw has a 50 percent share of the market (and a majority of social media memes, too), but Truly, Bon and Viv, Henry's, Smirnoff, and others have also jumped on the boozy bandwagon.

Whole-y Toledo

More than four years after first teasing Toledo with a promise to open here, on Aug. 7 Whole Foods Market welcomed customers to its shiny, new location at 3420 Secor Rd.

Everyone was so excited about the opening that an estimated 800 to 1,000 people were lined up before 9 a.m.

From organic, non-GMO, and vegan items to sustainable meats and fish, and from prepared foods and baked goods to beer, wine, and fair trade coffees, the store offers a wide array of specialty groceries, some of them locally grown and/or produced.

Those who used to drive up to Ann Arbor's Whole Foods stores don't need to do so anymore.

You will shop better in Toledo.

Texto completo: Morgan Stickney began training for the Paralympics after having her left leg amputated below the knee. But a familiar pain struck again.
The New York Times Sports department is revisiting the subjects of some compelling articles from the last year or so. Here is our March report on Morgan Stickney's first recovery .
Something awful happened to Morgan Stickney on her way to joining the world of Paralympic swimming.
Stickney had been a young distance swimmer with dreams of Olympic glory until a foot ailment forced her to have her left leg amputated below the knee in May 2018, when she was only 20. But with an unyielding determination that has become her trademark, Stickney made the best of her situation: As The New York Times wrote in March, the amputation meant an end to five years of severe foot pain and dependence on opioid painkillers, and it enabled her to get back into the pool.
Within a few months, Stickney set remarkable times in the 100- and 400-meter freestyle and was invited to train at the United States Olympic and Paralympic Training Center in Colorado Springs. A new dream formed for Stickney, as a Paralympian in Tokyo next summer.
But then one day after training, she felt pain in her right foot. X-rays revealed fractures, and doctors said they would heal. Stickney dreaded something much worse, however.
She was right. The pain endured for weeks, and in June she had to leave the training center and move back home to Bedford, N.H., while a team of doctors tried to discover the root cause for her slowly dying right foot.
"I thought swimming was over forever, this time," she said. "For two or three weeks, I just cried every night."
For her father, Tony Stickney, the day he went to Colorado Springs to pack up Morgan's things and take her home was one of the saddest of his life. His daughter had endured so much pain and isolation in her late teenage years, but once she got off opioids and back into the pool, the old, happy Morgan resurfaced. And then all that was gone again.
On the plane ride home, Tony Stickney wept.
"I knew the happiness I felt eight months earlier was over," Tony Stickney said. "I was bawling my eyes out."
But it would get much worse.
Morgan's pain was intense, and she grew dependent on opioids again, sometimes taking as many as 20 pills to get through a day. Her parents feared an overdose.
She saw a series of doctors over several months until it was finally determined that a cardiovascular abnormality was preventing blood from flowing to her lower legs. An angiogram showed blood stalled after reaching her calf. There was no blood circulation in her remaining foot, and the bones were dying.
The diagnosis also explained why a broken bone in her left foot had never healed -- necessitating the first amputation.
Reluctantly, all her physicians agreed there was no alternative. At age 22, Stickney would need to have her other leg amputated, again below the knee. Terrified, she summoned all her strength to go through with it, and on Oct. 8, as she was wheeled into surgery, Stickney asked the nurses to pull back the sheet so she could get one last look at her foot.
Immediately after the surgery, Stickney and her family went through three days of unfathomable torment when her epidural did not work. For hours at a time, Stickney endured the excruciating pain of an amputation without a pain blocker while doctors tried to balance her medication and fix the epidural.
"It was brutal," Tony Stickney said. "At one point I mumbled a prayer to myself, 'God, where are you?"'
Over the next two days, Morgan fell in and out of consciousness, sweat pouring off her face as her screams echoed down the corridor while she squeezed her father's hand so tightly, they wondered if she had crushed his bones.
Late one night, Morgan tapped out a short text to an acquaintance: "I can't do this," she wrote.
"It was pure torture," she said in an interview in November. "If I had one leg to get up with, I would have jumped out a window. I'm not exaggerating."
Finally a nerve blocker, a more targeted form of pain relief, was inserted on Oct. 12, and the pain was brought under control. Her father snapped a photograph of his daughter actually smiling again, and from that moment forward, Stickney began the process that she hopes will get her back in the swimming pool and onto the medal stand.
She spent the next three weeks at a rehabilitation facility in Boston learning the initial stages of life without lower legs, starting with how to sit up in bed. Ten days after the operation, Stickney said, she stopped taking all opioids.
By early November, Stickney returned home to begin what she calls "my new normal." Until she can be fitted with a prosthesis, she has three wheelchairs -- one on each of the two floors of her house and one to get to the car. She scoots up and down stairs sitting down, and her father carries her around piggyback.
Through it all, Stickney has been taking college courses online and still hopes for a career in medicine. But first, there is swimming to do. A crowdfunding page had yielded more than $ 117,000 in donations by late Christmas week, and Stickney used some of the money to buy a Vasa machine -- an out-of-pool apparatus used by swimmers to train their upper bodies.
There is a long way to go, but Stickney still plans to compete for a spot at the 2024 Paralympics, and perhaps even sooner. She has been invited to the Indianapolis Paralympic World Series in April. If she can get ready in time, she could return to Colorado Springs and be chosen for the 2020 United States Paralympic team in Tokyo.
Stickney is reluctant to talk about that possibility. For now, she wants to learn how to walk again.
"I've been through hell the last few years, but I'm stronger because of it," she said. "Hopefully I can show others that, although life isn't perfect, you can still find happiness."

A More Organic Front Page Process

Texto completo: Today's A1 is the result of a far more democratic and organic process than the one in place when I arrived at The Times in 1978.
In an effort to shed more light on how we work, The Times is running a series of short posts explaining some of our journalistic practices. Read more from this series here.
When I started at The New York Times in 1978, the newsroom was a smoky, male dominion and the front-page meeting was held promptly at 5:30 p.m. around a small table in the executive editor's office.
Only the most senior editors were allowed to attend and pitch their stories, and their fear as the hour approached was palpable.
By midafternoon, it was not unusual to hear the crash of the national editor kicking a desk or slamming his phone down in frustration. Invariably, the reporter out in the field couldn't be found as the deadline neared, and the editor would have to go into the meeting far less prepared than he would have liked.
The front-page meeting was a place where the newsroom's best minds would choose the day's most important stories. But it was also a place where careers were made and sidelined.
It would take me years to get into that room, at first just to watch the prodding and questioning that went on, often with humiliating consequences for the editor who offered a story that was not deemed ready for publication.
It was hard not to be impressed by the intellectual firepower in the room. But it was also daunting to see gray-haired adults literally hiding their hands under the table so no one could see that they were shaking as they talked.
A lot has changed since then. Today's front page is the result of a far more democratic and organic process. For one thing, the newsroom's energy is no longer focused solely on the deadlines of a press run. Stories and slide shows, videos and interactive graphics are among the features going up on the web all day long.
There are "news meetings" at 9:30 a.m. and 4:30 p.m., where often 40 to 50 people sit around on modular furniture inside a glass-box room visible to much of the newsroom.
Washington editors, who once weren't even allowed to speak, now beam in on a giant TV screen, as do editors based overseas. In these meetings, it is routine to hear from sections that rarely have front-page candidates. Nowadays they are looking for "home page" time -- an ever-evolving 24-hour formula that allows far more stories to be showcased -- and promoted in newsletters and on our social media accounts.
For the most part, the front-page decisions are hashed out throughout the day, never far out of alignment with those being made for the web, though there is a separate front-page meeting at 3 p.m. There the final calls on stories are made (until something new happens and the page has to be remade). But much of the focus of that meeting is on looking at the available photos and designing the page. The design will dictate the size of headlines, leaving editors little room to maneuver -- unlike the more flexible, and fluid, procedure for the web. Often the headline on the print story deemed the most important of the day is in a narrow column, allowing only six or seven words -- not even half a tweet. (This got us into trouble recently, when the need for a very short front-page print headline resulted in one that lacked sufficient context.)
Though in some ways the front-page decisions have become secondary in today's 24-hour news cycle, many reporters and editors still measure their success by how many of their stories land there.
It is still a tradition in the newsroom to commemorate a reporter's first front-page story with a metal plate of the page used by our local plant. (So far, no one seems satisfied with a screen grab.)
The types of stories that appear on the front page have also changed mightily over the years. In the 1980s, government announcements, ceremonial meetings between world leaders and stories based on newly released reports often dominated the page, as did pictures of mayors and businessmen standing behind lecterns.
Since then, the definition of important news has pushed into new areas. Analysis, lifestyle and original reporting began to edge out yearly stories about the Macy's parade and particularly hot or particularly cold days in New York. (Yes, as a young reporter I wrote countless parade and weather stories.)
The changes were often distressing to the old guard. When I was named National editor in 2005, a retired managing editor who had once taken an interest in my career took me out to lunch to celebrate. But he could not stop talking about what he saw happening at the paper.
How, he asked, could a story about how some parents in America were trying to mimic the toilet training habits used in foreign countries have made its way onto the front page? "That is a subject for the Style section!" he railed.
I couldn't have disagreed more. Someplace in the world there is a 7-month-old baby who doesn't need diapers at night? That has to interest just about anybody who has ever had a child. But trying to breach the boundaries was not necessarily a good thing for your career, either.
Dean Baquet, the executive editor of The New York Times, counts himself lucky to have survived his decision in 1997, when he was National editor, to offer a story for A1 about teenagers who, fearing AIDS, were engaging in more oral sex.
The room went silent, Mr. Baquet recalls. The assistant managing editor running the meeting that day slowly let his head drop until his forehead hit the table. The story did eventually make its way into the paper, but not onto the front page.
Today, Mr. Baquet notes, the story wouldn't raise an eyebrow. "By today's standards," he says, "it reads like a science story."

Texto completo: Those of us in journalism primarily do one thing: cover events. We report and opine about events like election campaigns, wars and crimes. A lot of the events we cover are decisions - a decision to reform health care or write a tweet - so we tend to congregate in the cities where decision-makers live. The internet has sped up the news cycle. Now we put more emphasis on covering the last event that just happened. But it's still mostly events.
But a funny thing has happened to events in this era. They have ceased to drive politics the way they used to. We've seen gigantic events like impeachment, the Kavanaugh hearings, the Mueller investigation and the "Access Hollywood" tapes. They come and go and barely leave a trace on the polls, the political landscape or evaluations of Donald Trump.
Events don't seem to be driving politics. Increasingly, sociology is.
Do you want to predict how a certain region is going to vote in the 2020 presidential race? Discover who settled the region in the 17th and 18th centuries. If the settlers were from the East Anglia section of Britain, then that region is probably going Democratic. If the settlers were from the north of Britain, that region is very likely to vote for Donald Trump.
Do you want to predict how a state is going to vote? Find out how that state voted in the 1896 presidential election. As Washington University political scientists Gary Miller and Norman Schofield have observed, 22 of the 23 states that voted Democratic in 1896 had turned Republican by 2000. Similarly, 17 of the 22 states that voted Republican in 1896 had turned Democratic by 2000. The parties have flipped regions.
Do you want to predict how an individual is going to vote? Ask a simple question: Is she urban or rural?
Geographic and psychosociological patterns now overshadow events in driving political loyalties and national electoral outcomes. Demography is destiny.
There's a more precise way to put this. An event is really two things. It's the event itself and then it's the process by which we make meaning of the event. As Aldous Huxley put it, "Experience is not what happens to you, it's what you do with what happens to you."
When a whole country sees events through a similar lens, then you don't have to think a lot about the process people use to make meaning. It's similar across the land. But when people in different regions and subcultures have nonoverlapping lenses, the process by which people make sense of events is more important than the event itself.
For reasons I don't understand, we've had an epistemic explosion over the past few decades. Different American regions and subcultures now see reality through nonoverlapping lenses. They make meaning in radically different ways. Psychosocial categories have hardened.
We in the media will continue to cover events, which, of course, is absolutely necessary. But with some noble exceptions (I'm thinking of Thomas Edsall of The New York Times and Ronald Brownstein of The Atlantic), we underreport on how meaning is made in different subcultures. You can't make sense of reality without that. Often we throw up our hands: "Can't these people see the facts?!?" I'm as guilty as anyone.
In this new context, I'm curious to know how lenses get crafted. For example, intersectionality is a lens that was created by theorists decades ago and is now a way of seeing that many people use to organize their view of reality. How did that happen?
I'm curious to know how a man in rural Idaho who has lost a son to suicide and a brother to fentanyl sees the impeachment hearing. How does he make meaning of that event in real time?
I'm curious to know how you can change another person's lens. Can you do it by writing and talking or do you have to move her to a different place and immerse her in a different reality?
I'm curious to know how power inequality shapes people's lenses. As Jonathan Rauch suggests in the current issue of National Affairs, ideological polarization is not on the rise; emotional polarization is on the rise. We don't necessarily disagree more. We perceive our opponents to be more menacing. We see more fearfully.
The big difference for those of us in media is that the main story is not only where the decision-makers are creating events. It's also and maybe more so in the eyes of those doing the perceiving.
Obviously, in this era it's even more important to have a news organization that is ideologically, culturally and geographically diverse, so you can surface and explore the different unconscious ways groups see.
It's also important to ask different questions. It's not enough to simply ask people's opinions through polls and interviews. Epistemology is deeper than opinions. It's found through deeper probing.
This is a wonderful opportunity for us to think about our jobs in more profound ways. The core insight is that in a hyperpluralistic society you can't know people in other groups until you know how they know you.

Texto completo: Sue Lyon, who was cast as a 14-year-old in the title role of Stanley Kubrick’s 1962 film, “Lolita,” died Thursday in Los Angeles. She was 73.
Longtime friend Phil Syracopoulos announced her death, The New York Times reported. He said she had been in declining health.
Lyon played the title role in the film adaptation of Vladimir Nabokov’s novel about a middle-aged man who becomes obsessed with a 12-year-old girl.
Nabokov, who helped adapt his novel for the screen, called Lyon, “the perfect nymphet,” using the word he used in his novel, the newspaper reported.
Lyon won a Golden Globe in 1963 in the most promising newcomer-female category for “Lolita,” Variety reported.

Godspeed Sue Lyon, brilliant in Lolita of course, but I also loved her in John Ford's late classic, Seven Women. Much of her life seems to have been a struggle. I hope she's at peace. #TCMParty pic.twitter.com/eVsrYX65d5

After “Lolita,” Lyon appeared in “The Night of the Iguana” (1964), “Tony Rome” (1967), and “Evel Knievel” (1971). Her last film credit was in “Alligator,” a 1980 horror movie, the Times reported. She also appeared on television in shows including “Police Story,” “Night Gallery,” “Men at Law” and “The Virginian.”

Texto completo: A Catawba Island beagle named Oscar is one of the dogs featured in the book "Doctor Dogs" by New York Times bestselling author Maria Goodavage
The book highlights medical alert dogs from around the world. Oscar was abandoned by his previous owner before Deanne "DeeDee" Kramer and her late husband, Bill, adopted him as a walking companion. But Oscar did more than become a walking buddy. He saved their lives.
Bill was struggling with complications from diabetes, which kept sending him to the emergency room several times a month. Finally, his doctor told him he needed to get a dog to help him become more active.
"We couldn't handle a lab," DeeDee said. "And then we heard about Oscar."
Oscar's first rescue came before he had any training. When Bill collapsed from a heart attack, Oscar, barking, ran to DeeDee to let her know. The incident exposed Oscar's intelligence and potential, and the Kramers decided to see if he could be trained as a diabetic alert dog to alert Bill when his blood sugar levels changed. Their search for a trainer eventually brought them to Nick and Tammy Blackford of North Coast K-9, who have offices in Sandusky and Monroeville. Nick, who has been training dogs since 1974, has trained many of the area's police dogs.
Oscar excelled through 500 hours of training, which included Canine Good Citizen, therapy dog, and public access training. His training to detect blood sugar level changes was intensive.
To prepare for the training, Bill spit on cotton balls when his sugar was high and when his sugar was low. Nick placed those cotton balls, along with other cotton balls, in containers around the training facility. When Oscar found the right cotton ball, he was rewarded. As a result, Oscar was able to detect when Bill's sugar changed. If it was high, he pawed on Bill's knees. If it was low, he pushed his nose into Bill's face.
"He was 10 minutes faster than the meter," DeeDee said. "After Oscar got trained, Bill had zero emergency room visits."
After Bill died, DeeDee's mourning kept her from caring for herself the way she normally did, and her hypoglycemia began to worsen. Now, Oscar alerts her when her blood sugar reaches dangerous levels. "If I'm driving, he'll come from the back of the car and make me pull over," DeeDee said.
Dogs can be trained to respond to medical emergencies in a variety of ways that suit their owners' needs. "Some are trained to bark so if the person is in another room with the door shut, the dog can still alert them," Nick said.
In addition to helping the Kramers, Oscar detected cancer in DeeDee's friend. The story of that miraculous rescue is recorded in "Doctor Dogs." "He wasn't even trained for that," DeeDee said.
Oscar also accompanies DeeDee when she volunteers at the Ohio Veterans Home.
DeeDee said it's not unusual for beagles to be trained as alert dogs because their ability to smell is so acute.
"Basset hounds are good, too," she said. "But if you want a diabetic alert dog, go to trainer, and they will find one suited to you. Don't just go out and get a puppy."

Texto completo: The end of each decade affords us a chance to look at our world from the proverbial 30,000-foot view and see how we've changed.
With the help of Maxar, a provider of advanced, space-based technology solutions, Google and NASA, we've taken many more steps back – more than 300 miles above Earth to be exact.
That perspective reveals some engineering marvels stoked by commerce and others driven by international power struggles. The views help us see how our technological advances could put us at risk in the decades to come.
Eyeing Apple
As Apple stormed toward becoming one of the most valuable companies on the planet, its campus in Cupertino, California, took the shape of a dial on the original iPods – the product that marked Apple's reemergence as tech leader at the turn of the century.
A cautionary note for Apple Park: Glitzy corporate digs don't always pan out
Skyscrapers in the sand
Apple's 175-acre, space-age architectural marvel stands out as a monument to tech. The same might be said for tourism, trade and energy about the ostentatious structures and engineering feats that emerged from the sands of Dubai in the United Arab Emirates.

Thirteen of the largest buildings in the world were completed in Dubai – the most in any city – during the past decade, according to the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat. Seventy-seven of the 100 largest buildings worldwide have been built since 2010, including 40 in Chinese cities.

The world’s tallest buildings: Why they aren’t being built in the USA anymore
China's influence grows
You need look no farther than the Spratly Islands in the South China Sea to see signs of China's growing influence in the region and the world. There it has reshaped Fiery Cross Reef into a landing strip and port.
China added a maritime rescue center on the man-made island this year, but that hasn't alleviated concerns that the port might allow China to exert greater control in the resource-rich South China Sea.

Man-made climate?
As the structures and global economy grew during the decade, so did the levels of greenhouse gases in our atmosphere and the intensity of our climate events. Each year has brought new highs in carbon dioxide – the greenhouse gas most responsible for global warming.
Three hurricanes in 2017 are among the five costliest weather and climate disasters in U. S. history. Hurricane Harvey dropped record-breaking amounts of rain – more than 40 inches in areas around Houston – aided by unusually warm water in the Gulf of Mexico.
"We show, for the first time, that the volume of rain over land corresponds to the amount of water evaporated from the unusually warm ocean," said Kevin Trenberth of the National Center for Atmospheric Research. Seawater in the Gulf was nearly 86 degrees, which helped boost Harvey's intense rainfall.
Simonton, Texas, on Aug. 30, 2017
Harvey took 89 lives and caused $130 billion in damage, according to NOAA. Less than two weeks later, Hurricane Irma devastated the U. S. Virgin Islands – St. John and St. Thomas – as a Category 5 storm before making landfall at Cudjoe Key, Florida, as a Category 4 storm. The storm killed 97 people and cost $52 billion.
Anse Marcel, St. Martin, on Sept. 11, 2017
The biggest loss of human life came 10 days later when Hurricane Maria made landfall in southeast Puerto Rico. The storm left 2,981 dead – a toll that took months to determine – and cost $93. 6 billion.
Puerto Rico on Sept. 24, 2017
More intense fires
The Camp Fire in 2018 was the deadliest and most destructive fire in California history, burning nearly 14,000 homes and killing 85 people. PG&E, whose equipment ignited the fire, said recently that it's looking into technology-based solutions to the pressing problem of wildfires, which have become increasingly destructive for a number of reasons, including climate change, a major contributor to vegetation drying and becoming more combustible.
The West's next deadly wildfires: The risks are everywhere
Melting glaciers
A study this year suggests our planet's glaciers continue to melt away, losing up to 390 billion tons of ice and snow each year. The largest losses were glaciers in Alaska, followed by melting ice fields in South America and glaciers in the Arctic. A New York Times report this year focused on the Tuyuksu glacier in Kazakhstan. The glacier is melting rapidly and within a couple of decades could be lost as a source of drinking water for 2 million people.

Concerns with nuclear power
Though nuclear power plants don't fuel climate change the way carbon-based fuels do, Japan's Fukushima disaster in 2011 was a potent reminder of the dangers of relying on nuclear reactors for power. The devastating earthquake, tsunami and nuclear accident at Fukushima killed one worker and cost nearly $120 billion. The tsunami swamped reactors 1 through 4 and crippled the nuclear plant.

Hope for the future?
Maybe one sign that Americans are taking climate change more seriously is near Reno, Nevada, at Tesla's ever-expanding electric car facility. When the facility is completed, it will cover more than 10 million square feet.
If not, maybe Elon Musk's other venture SpaceX or Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin will chart our next course.

Texto completo: When you happen to be dating Aaron Rodgers, getting the Green Bay Packers quarterback to be a guest on your podcast becomes a whole lot easier.
Danica Patrick sat down with Rodgers for an hour and 45 minutes for the latest episode of her Pretty Intense podcast that debuted Thursday. It's a wide-ranging conversation that covers spirituality, smarts, football, winning and losing, religion, Chives Restaurant, music, leadership, authenticity, UFOs, food, "Jeopardy," Johnny Cash, badminton, social media, Wisconsin weather, scotch, Scooby-Doo, mustaches and Dairy Queen Blizzards.
Here are 10 fun takeaways to get you started, but be sure to stick around until the end of the podcast for the "I love you's."
1. Rodgers does eight to 12 crossword puzzles a week. Spending time with his grandparents as a kid introduced him to his love of crosswords. He does them on his New York Times app, in USA TODAY and occasionally the local newspaper for both fun and to help keep his mind sharp. Sometimes he'll even do one in the three hours before a game at Lambeau Field.
"I do enjoy them, but also I've had a number of concussions and you worry about your future brain functions, and I feel like doing crosswords, doing Sudoku, doing KenKen, watching 'Jeopardy,' brushing your teeth with a different hand, tying your shoes in different orders, there's a lot of different things that you can do to stay sharp mentally, and I think that's one of them, crosswords."
2. He has a serious sweet tooth. There was a time when he could easily polish off a half-gallon of ice cream or a bag of Starburst jellybeans — two things he has given up since cycling off dairy and meeting Patrick, who he said is "way more disciplined" in her eating habits.
"I've always had a major sweet tooth. I love just about anything sweet," he said.
That includes waffles for dinner, Jordy Nelson's grandma's candy bar pie and Patrick's (healthy) vanilla cupcakes. She asked if it made him mad when she called him out for too much peanut butter or maple syrup.
"No, because I have a love affair with food. You can't put a damper on it."
While Patrick never has a cheat day, Rodgers did admit to a couple of cheat meals when she's not around (and also raiding the vegan chocolate chips that she sometimes tries to hide from him in the pantry.) Patrick has helped him with his diet, reading labels and being more aware of where food comes from.
"I miss Blizzards for sure from Dairy Queen, 100 percent," he said. His Blizzard of choice: Oreo and Reese's Peanut Butter Cup mixed together.
3. He's never had a speeding ticket. He likes to remind Patrick that he's a fantastic driver, telling her, "You may have been a professional race car driver, but I'm a professional in-street driver, highway driver."
4. He doesn't just read a book, he gets out the highlight marker. A passionate reader with what Patrick categorized as "a giant book collection," he counts John Krakauer among his favorite authors and cited his 2009 book, "Where Men Win Glory: The Odyssey of Pat Tillman" as one of his favorite reads. He also listed "The Shack" by William P. Young as interesting to him when he was younger, and "Love Wins: A Book About Heaven, Hell, and the Fate of Every Person Who Ever Lived" by Rob Bell as meaningful.
"I enjoy reading books on JFK. I recently read a crazy expose with just unbelievable detail about his life. The most dense book. I literally read it three times just to try and wrap my head around the information in it," Rodgers said.
Patrick pointed out that he also went through multiple highlight markers in the process.
"I love to highlight and underline in my reading," he said, saying that he also took notes. "Because there's so much information, and I want to retain it."
5. His pregame playlist sounds like this: Bon Iver, Trevor Hall, Nahko, Lord Huron and Jon Bryant, along with old favorites like Counting Crows, Nirvana, Pearl Jam and Foo Fighters. Last year, he was on a Johnny Cash kick. (Unrelated fun fact but too good not to mention: He says he can sing a mean karaoke version of "Wind of Change" by The Scorpions.)
6. His idea of fun covers a lot of territory. "I enjoy watching 'Jeopardy.' I enjoy reading. I enjoy doing crosswords. I really enjoy being out in nature. I like traveling."
He considers golf a good escape, likes to hike and loves the ocean and lakes. He looks forward to skiing and skydiving when he retires from football, and traveling to Egypt is on his bucket list.
7. He's all about the calm in the clutch. Patrick, calling him "the most clutch player ever," said you can almost feel his mental shift into a new space when it's down to the final minutes and the game is on the line. She asked him what that feels like for him.
"Calm. Yeah, very calm. When I was 5 and I watched Joe Montana take the Niners down the field against the Bengals and throw a touchdown to John Taylor for the win, I remember thinking that's what I wanted to do. Then fast forward to 14 and I'm watching MJ, Michael Jordan, last game with the Bulls, and he crosses up (Bryon) Russell at the foul line and drains a mid-range shot and that's what I always said, 'I want to do that. I want the ball in the clutch moments.' "
8. The three best concerts he has ever seen were all at iconic venues. Nahko and Trevor Hall earlier this year with Patrick at Red Rocks Amphitheatre in Colorado; Tegan and Sara and Death Cab for Cutie at the Hollywood Bowl; and The Killers for a standing-room-only show at The Rave in Milwaukee in 2009. He also gave shout-outs to live shows by Pearl Jam at the Bradley Center in Milwaukee, Foo Fighters in Madison, Prince and Brad Paisley.
9. Patrick has changed his life. From a practical standpoint, that means fewer cheat days when it comes to eating, and having dogs in the house (she has two).
"From an emotional standpoint, I think you're a very steady person, so that's been nice to have a steady energy," Rodgers told her, adding she brings a calm to the house. "You're a peacemaker. Sometimes you fight for it, but you're a peacemaker."
He also talked about what an amazing cook she is, her work ethic ("You put your mind to something and you're going to do it") and her sense of curiosity. When she said she can sometimes be stubborn, Rodgers can be heard with a well-timed clearing of the throat.
10. He knows his mustache can be "a little creepy." He always wanted to have a great mustache, thanks to "Tombstone," one of his all-time favorite movies and basically a showcase of bad-ass mustaches (Kurt Russell, Sam Elliott, Bill Paxton). His dad also had a mustache when Rodgers was growing up.
"It's a little creepy at times but I do enjoy it," he said of his own at age 36, pointing out that the creepy goes away a little when it covers the top lip. Then it's just cowboy.

Texto completo: Yes, the rich have too much political influence.
Elizabeth Warren has been getting a lot of grief in the news media lately. Some of it, no doubt, reflects campaign missteps. But much of it is a sort of visceral negative reaction to her criticisms of the excessive influence of big money in politics -- a reaction that actually vindicates her point.
It's true that earlier in her career Warren, like just about everyone else, did fund-raisers with wealthy donors. So? Charges of inconsistency -- "you said X, now you say Y" -- are all too often a journalistic dodge, a way to avoid dealing with the substance of what a candidate says. Politicians should, after all, change their minds when there's good reason to do so.
The question should be, was Warren right to announce, back in February, that she would halt high-dollar fund-raisers? More broadly, is she right that the wealthy have too much political influence?
And the answer to the second question is surely yes.
The first thing you need to know about the very rich is that they are, politically, different from you and me. Don't be fooled by the handful of prominent liberal or liberal-ish billionaires; systematic studies of the politics of the ultrawealthy show that they are very conservative, obsessed with tax cuts, opposed to environmental and financial regulation, eager to cut social programs.
The second thing you need to know is that the rich often get what they want, even when most of the public want the opposite. For example, a vast majority of voters -- including a majority of self-identified Republicans -- believe that corporations pay too little in taxes. Yet the signature domestic policy of the Trump administration was a huge corporate tax cut.
Or to take an issue close to Warren's heart -- and her signature policy achievements -- most Americans, including a plurality of Republicans, favor tougher regulation of big banks; yet even before Donald Trump took office, the relatively mild regulations put into effect after the 2008 financial crisis were under sustained political assault.
Why do a small number of rich people exert so much influence in what is supposed to be a democracy? Campaign contributions are only part of the story. Equally if not more important is the network of billionaire-financed think tanks, lobbying groups and so on that shapes public discourse. And then there's the revolving door: It's depressingly normal for former officials from both parties to take jobs with big banks, corporations and consulting firms, and the prospect of such employment can't help but influence policy while they're still in office.
Last but not least, media coverage of policy issues all too often seems to reflect the views of the wealthy. Take, for example, the issue of policies to combat unemployment.
Unemployment in the United States is currently at a historical low, just 3.5 percent -- and we're achieving that low unemployment without any sign of runaway inflation, which tells us that we were capable of this kind of performance all along. Remember when people like Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, told us that high unemployment was inevitable because of a "skills gap"? They were wrong.
But it took us a very long time to get here, because unemployment receded only slowly from its post-crisis peak. The average unemployment rate over the past decade was 6.3 percent, which translates into millions of person-years of gratuitous joblessness.
Why didn't we recover faster? The most important reason was fiscal austerity -- spending cuts, supposedly to reduce the budget deficit, that exerted a steady drag on the economy from 2010 onward. But who was obsessed with budget deficits? Voters in general weren't -- but surveys indicate that even when the unemployment rate was above 8 percent the wealthy considered budget deficits a bigger problem than lack of jobs.
And the news media echoed these priorities, treating them not as the preferences of one small group of voters but as the only responsible position. As Vox's Ezra Klein noted at the time, when it came to budget deficits it seemed that "the usual rules of reportorial neutrality" didn't apply; reporters openly advocated policy views that were at best controversial, not widely shared by the general public and, we now know, substantively wrong.
But they were the policy views of the wealthy. And when it comes to treatment of differing policy views, the media often treats some Americans as more equal than others.
Which brings me back to the 2020 campaign. You may disagree with progressive ideas coming from Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders, which is fine. But the news media owes the public a serious discussion of these ideas, not dismissal shaped by a combination of reflexive "centrist bias" and the conscious or unconscious assumption that any policy rich people dislike must be irresponsible.
And when candidates talk about the excessive influence of the wealthy, that subject also deserves serious discussion, not the cheap shots we've been seeing lately. I know that this kind of discussion makes many journalists uncomfortable. That's exactly why we need to have it.

Texto completo: Forget big donations. Go for structural reforms.
In May, the billionaire Robert Smith was widely lauded when he announced he would pay the student debt of Morehouse College's graduating class to the tune of $ 34 million. So were Michael Bloomberg, the former New York mayor and presidential candidate, who gave $ 1.8 billion to his alma mater, Johns Hopkins University, in 2018, and Steve Tisch, who earmarked $ 10 million for middle-class students at U.C.L.A. in October. Ken Langone, a founder of Home Depot, appeared on a TV show last year to celebrate his surprise gift of $ 100 million to help pay the tuition of medical students at New York University.
Welcome to the world of those I call shock benefactors. While these 1-percenters deserve praise for their generosity, the reality is these donations are also symptoms of an economic system out of whack; this kind of giving does little to alleviate structural problems afflicting millions of others who are not being helped by a theatrical act of philanthropy. Such sudden altruism will likely inspire copycats but, without structural change, the system will continue to indenture college graduates, whose debt burden totals $ 1.6 trillion. These givers just palliate a small part of it.
In addition, the lucky students are hardly saved from an economic system that remains hostile to them. As Daniel Edwards, a junior at Morehouse, told me, "It's a Band-Aid fix." He's happy for his "brothers who got economic freedom," but also noted that "in every classroom you sit in, odds are one of the students to the left or right of you is still in financial struggle." That's because only a few colleges are affordable for families earning under $ 70,000 a year. In other words, the issue is inequality.
It's likely that the billionaires would have had a much bigger impact had they put at least some of that money toward reforming either the astronomically expensive college system, or the tax regulatory one which has allowed them to hoard money, depriving us of tax revenues that would pay for better schools, better health care, better everything.
It's obvious why shock benefactors appeal to us, with their sudden joyous and viral acts of generosity. They satisfy our narrative needs, resembling the long-lost relatives in Victorian novels who bequeath their fortunes to our heroes and heroines, making their lives bearable. But as Anand Giridharadas, the author of "Winners Take All," put it: "While a gift like that gives the giver a moral glow, that glow is undeserved" because, as he told me, "The Morehouse gift helped one class of students at one college while not alleviating the debt burden in any other school or in any other year or any other college."
Sara Goldrick-Rab, a professor of higher education policy and sociology at Temple University, noted the tremendous media attention these gifts receive, in contrast to Washington State's less visible move to make tuition free or reduce its cost for every admitted low-income student at its state schools. This disparity in attention is probably because it was neither exciting nor elite. This points to yet another problem with the shock benefactors' gifts: They are often given to the most heralded universities rather than to far needier community and state colleges.
Many critics also cite the tax benefits that philanthropists may receive, allowing them to take advantage of dubious tax loopholes like carried interest. So what should philanthropists who want to avoid these pitfalls do instead?
They might question the loopholes that have made many of these billionaires too wealthy in the first place (again: depriving working people of income that has gone to the 1 percent, and depriving the government of revenues to provide services we need). They could buy the debt of students from a range of social class backgrounds, as the Debt Collective has done.
Caitlin Zaloom, the author of "Indebted" and an associate professor at New York University, said, "It would be better if philanthropists can work together to make all or most colleges affordable and sustainable for students, whether they are middle class or lower income." College benefactors could also band together and donate to community and other public colleges each year.
Finally, they could donate to local, state and national candidates who are supporting student debt relief or who propose to make college free or highly subsidized. Supporting these candidates isn't going to provide structural transformation in and of itself. But if the candidates win, their policies could bring about these changes. The truth is, real change may not require shocking amounts of private money, but rather brave public policy.

Andrew Cuomo vetoes popular bill by his own party just so he can stick it to Trump judges

Texto completo: New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has vetoed a popular state bill sponsored by a member of his own party because it would have allowed any federal appellate or district judges, even those appointed by the Trump administration, to officiate wedding ceremonies in the Empire State.

That will show the president who is the boss.

“I cannot in good conscience support legislation that would authorize such actions by federal judges who are appointed by this federal administration,” the governor said in his veto message. “President Trump does not embody who we are as New Yorkers.”

We are all about “diversity, tolerance, and inclusion,” Cuomo's note continued.
“Based on these reasons, I must veto this bill,” he wrote, adding once more in what I presume is a mistake, “Based on these reasons, I must veto this bill.”

For the record, the list of officials who can legally officiate a wedding in New York is long and comprehensive, and it includes the governor himself. State judges can officiate weddings, but federal appeals and district court judges cannot! Take that, Drumpf!

The bill’s Democratic sponsor, state Sen. Liz Krueger, is equal parts befuddled and annoyed.

“This is the least substantive or controversial bill I have ever introduced,” she told the New York Times. “I did not think the reasoning made sense.”

Her bill passed the state Assembly by a margin of 144-2. It later passed the Senate by a margin of 61-1.

Krueger said she is alarmed by some of the positions staked out by Trump-appointed judges, especially in regard to illegal immigration. However, she added, “I’m not sure my moral outrage extends to refusing them the right to perform weddings.”

Republican state leaders, naturally, are picking apart Cuomo for his decision.
“It’s hard to imagine a more petty, small action from a sitting governor, but that’s Prince Andrew in a nutshell,” said state Republican Party Chairman Nick Langworthy.

For now, Krueger says she has no intention of reintroducing the bill until she sees a change in Cuomo’s way of thinking. She added that there are enough workarounds for anyone who wants to get married in New York.

“[P]retty much everyone had a way to officiate,” she said. “I actually became a fake minister years ago to marry two friends who met through me. My father felt I should have become a fake rabbi, but there wasn’t a website.”

In other words, the governor’s veto is exactly what we have come to expect from the anti-Trump "resistance" crowd: performative acts of rebellion that are small, weak, and, most importantly, impotent.

Texto completo: OLIVESBURG, OHIO – For Sam Donohue, philanthropy started early.
The son of Crestview graduates Sean and Molly Donohue, the 5-year-old came up with the idea to have a drive for socks for needy children.
His idea blew up more than his parents could have imagined. The drive led to the donation of 619 pairs of socks, 80 hats and 121 pairs of gloves. People also contributed three earmuffs, three headbands, a pair of shoes, a fleece jacket and a scarf.
"It kind of spread, which was really awesome," Molly Donohue said. "It got exciting for us as parents."
The idea came from the children's book "What Do You Do with an Idea," a New York Times bestseller.
"You change the world," Donohue said. "It's kind of a lot for a 5-year-old. We tried to make it make more sense to him.
"We could help other people. Socks and warm things are not something everybody has. It started very small."
It grew very big.
Donohue's mother, Joyce Brennan, shared the idea with her garden club.
"They did a huge collection," Donohue said.
A neighbor – the Donohues live in Akron – donated 200 pairs of socks. Sean Donohue mentioned the drive at his workplace.
Because of the huge haul, the Donohues divided the donations between Crestview and Akron City Schools, where Sam is in preschool.
"I'm hoping that this continues his whole life," Donohue said.
Sam Donohue, 5, started a sock drive for needy kids that ended up with nearly 600 donated pairs.

Texto completo: Even if you know nothing about American jurisprudence, you probably know Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
Such is the U.S. Supreme Court justice's street cred that her likeness has appeared on socks, T-shirts, coffee cups and pillow covers. She even has her own action figure. The Brooklyn native is also a popular meme on the internet, often with the words "I dissent," and a recurring character played by Kate McKinnon on "Saturday Night Live."
So how did it all come to be?
A traveling exhibition celebrating Justice Ginsburg's work as a civil and women's rights activist attempts to answer that question. And its first East Coast stop is the city where our country took its first steps toward independence - Philadelphia.
The special exhibit at the National Museum of Jewish American History is called "Notorious RBG: The Life and Times of Ruth Bader Ginsburg." It was inspired by the Tumblr blog and New York Times bestselling book of the same name and was created in partnership with its authors, Irin Carmon and Shana Knizhnik. It came to Philly this fall by way of the Skirball Cultural Center in Los Angeles, where the original exhibition opened in October 2018. You still have a few weeks left to see it before it closes Jan. 12.
Only the second woman - and first Jewish woman - to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court, Justice Ginsburg's accomplishments are many. The retrospective brings that pioneering work as a lawyer and women's rights activist to life with items ranging from archival photographs and documents to historical (and fun) artifacts.
One of the more interesting is a tattoo of the justice in profile created by artist Ari Richter. It's made from pigmented cheek skin cured onto glass panes.
Then there's a fundraising letter for Columbia Law School, where she graduated first in her class in 1959. When the letter said "him" she added the words "or her." There's also the spiky jabot (collar) Justice Ginsburg wears to telegraph her mood when she offers her dissent to Supreme Court decisions.
Visitors get to watch home movies, view family photographs, see a mock-up of her desk and examine an outfit worn by actress Felicity Jones when she played RBG in the film "On the Basis of Sex." You'll also hear the 86-year-old justice's voice in recordings of court decisions, including her famous dissent in the 2013 Shelby County vs. Holder case on voters' rights in Alabama.
"I think people instinctively consider her stature when they think about her," says Josh Perelman, the museum's chief curator and director of exhibitions and interpretation.
But the exhibition also aims to tell the story of the person behind the robes - from her childhood growing up in Flatbush to her 56-year marriage to lawyer Martin D. Ginsburg.
"All people on the Supreme Court seem untouchable because it's the highest court in the land," says Mr. Perelman. The RBG exhibit affords the justice "the humanness" she deserves and does justice to her legacy, he says.
While photos, sadly, are not permitted in the gallery, fans can take a selfie with a life-sized cutout of Justice Ginsburg on the museum's concourse level. At the nearby gift shop, you can memorialize your visit with any number of RBG-themed items. (I bought a dissent collar bib for my new granddaughter.)
You also can try on a judicial robe and jabot or pose at a mock Supreme Court bench wearing a crown.
"She's one of the few figures in contemporary American life who's universally admired," says Mr. Perelman. "She is an inspiration, not only for what she has achieved in her life but for what she continues to achieve on a daily basis in her stand for equal rights and equal opportunities and the value of American freedom."
After the exhibition closes Jan. 12, it will travel to the Illinois Holocaust Museum and Education Center in Skokie, near Chicago.

Boeing's New CEO to Focus on FAA Cooperation; Dave Calhoun seeks to ease friction with regulators as 737 MAX grounding persists

Texto completo: When Dave Calhoun called the head of the Federal Aviation Administration on Monday, the incoming Boeing Co. chief executive officer purposely left other executives off the line.
That personal approach, highlighting the importance of the relationship and Mr. Calhoun's desire to start off on the right foot, marks the first step in his strategy to reset the plane maker's troubled dealings with regulators, people who know him said.
The most immediate challenge confronting Mr. Calhoun, who is 62 years old and takes over Jan. 13 , is persuading FAA policy makers that Boeing will be more reliable and cooperative in providing data to verify flight-control fixes for the grounded 737 MAX fleet. That would mean abandoning his predecessor Dennis Muilenburg's prodding of the agency over many months to accelerate vetting of the proposed software fix.
Mr. Muilenburg was ousted Monday, not long after Steve Dickson, the FAA administrator, publicly repudiated that approach and warned Boeing it had to produce more timely and complete information. In calls Monday to airlines, suppliers, pilot union leaders, lawmakers and the FAA, Mr. Calhoun and his team said their aim is to be more open and less confrontational, according to industry and government officials.

Boeing's problems with the FAA extend beyond technical issues. Earlier this year, regulators and lawmakers faulted the company for failing to swiftly provide internal documents from years earlier that appear to raise questions about the safety, design and extent of pilot training for the MAX.
The company's conduct in this regard could come under even more scrutiny, which Mr. Calhoun will likely have to deal with immediately in his new role. The FAA is currently examining how long ago Boeing officials discovered certain documents that it sent to the agency and congressional committees on Monday, and whether it should have alerted the agency sooner, a person briefed on the matter said.
Those documents, the contents of which haven't been disclosed publicly, include additional material involving Mark Forkner, the former chief technical pilot for the MAX, people familiar with the matter said. They add to a previous set of instant messages from 2016 in the FAA's possession, which suggested that Mr. Forkner had concerns about the safety of the aircraft's flight-control system after encountering some problems in a simulator. Mr. Forkner's attorney has said that in the initial messages, his client and other pilots had concerns with the simulator, not the flight-control system itself.
On Tuesday, an aide for the House Transportation Committee said the latest communications "appear to point to a very disturbing picture" of concerns expressed by some Boeing employees about the company's commitment to safety. A Boeing spokesman said the company "proactively" turned over the documents as part of its commitment to transparency with regulators and lawmakers, but he added "the tone and content of some of these communications does not reflect the company we are and need to be." When asked about the new documents, Mr. Forkner's attorney said his client and other military veterans who flew the MAX "believed the plane was safe; the problem they saw was in the simulator."
The underlying challenges confronting Boeing, more than a year after the first of two fatal MAX crashes that took a total of 346 lives, haven't changed. Mr. Calhoun and his management team might find it tough to depict themselves as reformers because many of the same executives held high-ranking positions at the company during the development and marketing of the MAX. Even if Boeing makes more personnel changes, lawmakers and other critics said they will remain skeptical that Boeing has sufficiently revamped its culture or set a new precedent for its engineers or production workers.
Mr. Calhoun, a Boeing board member since 2009, also shares ultimate responsibility for the MAX's design and oversight of the company's response to the first accident in late 2018. The trio of leaders now atop Boeing—including new Chairman Larry Kellner and Chief Financial Officer Greg Smith, who will be acting CEO until mid-January—all share that history.
Boeing's board selected Mr. Calhoun to lead the company in part because he is familiar with the crisis and wouldn't need months to get up to speed on its complexities, a person close to the board said.
Analysts said they expect Mr. Kellner to concentrate on smoothing customer relations while Mr. Smith focuses on the financial community and customer compensation amid estimates that Boeing's ultimate price tag from the MAX crisis could top $20 billion.
Boeing declined to make Mr. Calhoun available for an interview on Tuesday. The company said its board appointed him CEO to restore confidence in the company and promised "a renewed commitment to full transparency."
Many FAA officials, frustrated by a pattern of delayed technical submissions, are skeptical of Boeing's latest promises. Foreign regulators have said they would independently vet changes to MCAS, an automated stall-prevention system that misfired and resulted in the accidents.
Mr. Calhoun also needs to change the company's engineering approach, former employees said. "You don't get your reputation back saying you're going to do things differently. You need to do things differently," said Jim Albaugh, who retired as chief executive of Boeing's commercial airplane division in 2012. "And the engineering part of it is key."
Mr. Calhoun will also have to work to repair Boeing's relationship with fliers. Boeing told airlines last week that its own polling showed around 40% of travelers world-wide are unwilling to fly on the MAX, according to materials reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.
Boeing has held calls with airlines this year to lay out plans for restoring confidence in the MAX and providing support to carriers when the plane returns to service. The plans described last week include testimonials from pilots, materials such as printed cards that airlines can share with pilots and flight attendants about the changes made to MCAS, and suggestions to help crew members reassure anxious travelers.
The materials in the presentations to airlines were earlier reported by the New York Times. A Boeing spokesman said the company is working to restore confidence in the company and the MAX.
U.S. airlines are planning their own demonstration flights during the period between when the MAX is recertified and when it returns to scheduled flying. Some airline executives have said they are hopeful Mr. Calhoun will improve relations with the FAA, helping smooth the process of returning the MAX to service.
Mr. Calhoun faces a major test on Jan. 29, when the company is slated to report full-year financial results. Outsiders will likely seek answers to how he intends to restore Boeing's reputation and reset a product strategy that has left it trailing arch rival Airbus SE.

Christmas Turns the World Upside Down

Texto completo: What does it mean for God's power to be "made perfect in weakness"?
If you were wholly unfamiliar with the life of Jesus and listened only to what many Christians in America say today, you could be forgiven for thinking that the most important thing Christianity values is worldly power -- the power to control and compel, to impose one's will on others, to vanquish one's enemies. Blessed are the politically powerful and the well connected, you might assume, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
The birth and life of Jesus shatter this narrative. Those of us of the Christian faith believe that Christmas Day represents the moment of God's incarnation, when this broken world became his home. But it was not an entrance characterized by privilege, comfort, public celebration or self-glorification; it was marked instead by lowliness, obscurity, humility, fragility.
The circumstances of Jesus' birth "were calculated to establish his detachment from power and authority in human terms," wrote Malcolm Muggeridge, a 20th-century British journalist who converted late in life to Christianity.
That could be said not just about Jesus' birth but also his entire life, which was in many respects an inversion of what the world, including much of the Christian world, prizes.
"Christ was born in a manger to a family for whom there was no room," Craig Barnes, the president of Princeton Theological Seminary, told me. "He was raised by unremarkable parents in an unremarkable part of the world, conducted a ministry that was missed by most people, died as a criminal on a cross, and his ascension was seen only by a small band of disciples who then led a movement that within three centuries changed the world."
The paradox is that Christianity changed the world despite Jesus' declaration that his kingdom was not of this world. His disciples did not have notable worldly status or influence. Jesus' energies and affections were primarily aimed toward social outcasts, the downtrodden and "unclean," strangers and aliens, prostitutes and the powerless. The people Jesus clashed with and who eventually crucified him were religious authorities and those who wielded political power. The humble will be exalted, Jesus said, and the last shall be first. True greatness is shown through serving others and sacrifice.
All of this calls to mind an account in II Corinthians, one I have been intrigued by for nearly as long as I have been a Christian. In his epistle, Paul is describing a "thorn in my flesh" that was tormenting him. (We don't know specifically what it was.) Three times he beseeched the Lord to remove it, according to the apostle, to which Jesus replied, "My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness." Paul went on to add, "For when I am weak, then I am strong."
What does it mean for God's power to be made perfect in weakness?
It's a statement as much about us as it is about God. Most of us know that we often grow in times of weakness rather than strength, when we face hardship rather than experience success. That isn't always the case; sometimes hardships and suffering simply overwhelm us and no good thing comes from them.
Everyone has a breaking point.
But it's also true that weakness can open the way for greater personal growth, reflection and self-reflection, and focus us on what is essential rather than ephemeral. Last week, a friend who is a counselor told me of a former colleague of his who, because of chronic pain, was bedridden for two years. That pain she's now largely free of. He described his former colleague as one the most cheerful and loving people he's ever met. "She's a better person" for having gone through her ordeal, he said. The point my friend was making isn't that suffering is good but that sometimes it can serve a purpose. This is true for people of different faiths and people of no faith.
But from a Christian standpoint, Craig Barnes told me, "Our weakness finally opens our eyes to the need for a Savior. Nothing prevents that more than our strength. No one has ever said, 'I was so successful I just had to come to Jesus."'
"We can only love when we are softened," according to Peggy Wehmeyer, a former religion correspondent for ABC. "We are most likely to be softened when we are weakened." Ms. Wehmeyer, who wrote movingly about her husband's suicide in these pages, told me that the aftermath of his death was "the most powerless I've ever felt. Trusting in God's goodness and yielding without being able to nail him down. That's where peace begins: Surrender, in powerlessness."
It's important to point out here that there are sufferings we may experience that make us a more resilient, deeper and more compassionate person, yet if we were asked whether we are glad for having gone through it, we would answer no.
James Forsyth, senior pastor of McLean Presbyterian Church in Virginia, which I attend with my family, was sexually abused as a teenager. "I wish this thing hadn't have happened to me," he says. But, he adds, "You can have scars and still be healed. There are some things in life you never move on from, but you do learn to carry them differently."
Whatever their full effects, human weakness and suffering are not meant to be ends in themselves. For Christians, they are meant to spur us to seek out God from a place of need and provide an opportunity for the display of divine power. And again: Power understood through the prism of Christianity is different from how the world generally understands power. Kerry Dearborn, professor emerita at Seattle Pacific University, described to me the difference between power over others and the power of connecting with others, which she said requires that there be openness and vulnerability.
As I understand the words of Jesus as recorded in II Corinthians, weakness opens us up to a fundamentally new definition of strength -- strength that is not coercive, domineering, prideful and self-seeking but rather compassionate, sacrificial, humble and empathetic. God's power, perfected through our weakness, makes us instruments of mercy, seekers of justice, agents of reconciliation. It helps us see the world in a different way.
Renée Notkin, a pastor at Union Church in Seattle, told me: "I am daily inspired by how Jesus continually turns the world upside down in regards to power, might, world success and achievement. Jesus' subversive challenges to the human-crafted structures that oppress and bind is what keeps me following Jesus and holding on to hope that there is a third way -- the Jesus way that brings healing to individuals, communities and nations."
The pastor, with whom I attended high school and college, added, "Jesus was most frequently out among the people -- engaging and paying attention to the realities of ordinary people's lives and helping them see that in God's eyes they are extraordinary -- and so often these are the people who are viewed as weak in the world. I am learning how to live well from those who hold very little worldly power but who are some of the most content and real people I've ever met."
"Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy," Jesus declared in his most famous sermon. "Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God."
This type of power, often arrived at having traveled through what the Psalmist called "the valley of the shadow of death," wasn't simply Jesus spouting off abstract teachings; it was his life story. What the incarnation represents is God entering history not as the screenwriter of the drama but as an actor within it. Jesus is the suffering protagonist.
No one thought it would start quite this way, an infant placed in a manger in a troubled corner of a troubled world. You would have thought he would be among the most inconsequential individuals ever.
You would have been wrong.

Texto completo: NEW YORK -- Former Uber CEO Travis Kalanick is resigning from the board of directors, severing ties with the ride-hailing company that he co-founded a decade ago and ran until a series of scandals led to his downfall.
The departure, announced Tuesday, did not come as a surprise. Kalanick recently sold more than $2.5 billion worth of stock in the company, or more than 90% of his holdings.
"Uber has been a part of my life for the past 10 years. At the close of the decade, and with the company now public, it seems like the right moment for me to focus on my current business and philanthropic pursuits," the 43-year-old entrepreneur said in a statement.
Uber turbocharged the gig economy and since 2010 has logged 15 billion trips. But Kalanick was ousted as CEO in the summer of 2017 with the company mired in lawsuits.
Uber under Kalanick grew with incredible speed, but like a number of other tech startups, it ran into trouble with a corporate culture that appeared at times to be spinning out of control.
In 2017, a former Uber engineer, Susan Fowler, leveled sexual harassment and sexism allegations in a blog post about her year at Uber. Fowler said a boss -- not Kalanick -- propositioned her and higher-ups ignored her complaints. Kalanick called the accusations "abhorrent" and hired former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder to investigate.
Days later, Waymo, the self-driving car company spun off from Google, sued Uber. Waymo alleged that a top manager at Google stole pivotal technology from the company before leaving to run Uber's self-driving car division.
Then, The New York Times revealed that Uber used a phony version of its app to thwart authorities in cities where it was operating illegally. Uber's software identified regulators who were posing as riders and blocked access to them. The U.S. Justice Department is investigating.
"Many investors will be glad to see this dark chapter in the rear view mirror," Dan Ives, managing director of Wedbush Securities, said in a note to investors.
After Kalanick's ouster, Dara Khosrwoshahi was brought on as CEO to clean up Uber's image and steer the company to its stock market debut in May. But Uber's stock floundered and fell almost 11% in its first day of trading as a public company. It has tumbled more than 30% since.

An emotional start to Hanukkah in Jersey City

Texto completo: JERSEY CITY, N.J. - JC Kosher Supermarket no longer has broken windows and strips of yellow police tape.
Less than two weeks ago, two gunmen charged the market in an anti-Semitic attack, leaving three bystanders dead and shocking Jersey City's thriving multicultural community.
Now the market is boarded up, spray-painted with a mural of a blue heart and the Pulaski Skyway bridge.
But Rabbi Moshe Schapiro, one of the organizers of a menorah lighting at the market Sunday, at the start of Hanukkah, had a hopeful message.
"The first night of Hanukkah at the very place of this shooting, which created so much darkness and negativity, can bring light and positivity," he said. "When we celebrate at a time like this, almost two weeks from a terrible shooting, we start thinking about what's the meaning of the holiday."
The menorah lighting is a central part of Hanukkah, which celebrates the victory 2,000 years ago of the Jewish Maccabees in their battle to regain Jerusalem from the Syrians. The menorah was used to cast light as they rebuilt their temple. There was enough oil to burn for only one night, but it lasted fcr eight.
On Sunday evening, a small silver menorah and boxes of doughnuts sat on a folding table in front of the market.
A little after 6:30 p.m., Yoely Greenfeld stood at the table, just a few feat away from where his sister, Leah Mindei Ferencz, was killed. With a red lighter, Greenfeld touched a flame to light the candle in the center of the menorah.
Children surrounded Greenfeld and Schapiro, who used both hands to shield the candle fiom the wind. One girl recorded them with an iPhone. Seconds later, after the wind settled, the first cancie was lit.
"My sister Mindy was someone who lit up the world with her smile and her beautiful personality, brightening lives both in Brooklyn and in her new home, Jersey City," Greenfeld said. "As we celebrate Hanukkah, may the lives of our candles shine away the darkness, easing the pains of all those who have suffered."
Greenfeld lit another candle, which he held in his hand as he chanted blessings and the crowd sang along. Then he placed the lit candle in the top right corner of the menorah.
Bouquets of flowers and posters were below the mural. One had the name Douglas Miguel Rodriguez, in memory of a market employee who had emigrated from Ecuador and was killed during the rampage. There were dozens of handwritten messages. "I miss his smile," one read.
After the lighting ceremony, Martha Freire Carrasco, Rodriguez's wife, stood by her husband's memorial and held back tears. It was the first time she had returned to the site since the shooting, she said.
Standing there resurfaced bad memories, she said, but seeing the messages of support comforted her. When she read the message about her husband's smile, she could not help but smile herself.
"That's the smile I fell in love with," Freire Carrasco said. "My husband Was love."
There were also scores of messages for Moshe Deutsch, a 24-year-old student killed in the attack. "May God rest your soul in eternal life," one message said. "We love you," read another.
The rabbi said that though the community had been shaken by the attack, he and other Jews still felt safe in Jersey City.
"The message of Hanukkah," he said, "is no matter where we are, light will always win over darkness. Good will always win over bad."
Bryan Leib, a board member with Americans Against Anti-Semitism, said he had come from Brooklyn to celebrate the first day of Hanukkah and to shine some light after two rough weeks.
"The Jews, we are very resilient people and we've always had to be," Leib, 34, said. "I'm sure no one will be leaving anytime soon. When things like this happen. We don't run away. Jews don't run."
Marissa Cossolini, who lives with her husband one block away from the scene of the shooting, said her family had no plans to leave the neighborhood. They still felt safe, she added.
"This is definitely not what defines Jersey City at all, which is why it's so shocking," Cossolini, 24, said.
She added: "Being present definitely shows something. We are one as a community."

California businesses at the breaking point due to minimum wage hikes

Texto completo: California’s minimum wage rises to $13 an hour on Jan. 1, and a number of its localities now have wage rates above $15 an hour.
Labor groups promised that $15 would be an economic boon for the state, while then-Gov. Jerry Brown worried that “economically, the minimum wage may not make sense.” The state’s experience with rapidly rising wage rates show the former governor was right to be concerned.
Consider the impact on the state’s full-service restaurant industry, which faces a double-whammy when the wage floor rises. California is one of a handful of states that doesn’t count tips towards an employee’s income; even if a server earns $300 on a Friday night, an effective wage rate of $60 an hour, his employer can’t count one cent of it towards the minimum wage requirement.
Restaurant owners are forced to give a raise to top-earning employees who take home far more than the minimum, with few options to offset the cost.
Paul Fraga, who announced he’s closing Sacramento diner Original Perry’s after more than 50 years in business, explained the dynamic. “For every dollar that [minimum wage] goes up, it costs me around $40,000…I can’t raise menu prices fast enough to compensate [for] that.” He added: “If they could sign a waiver, 99 percent of my servers would be against a minimum wage increase…”
Fraga isn’t alone in feeling the pinch from a rising minimum wage. Another affordably-priced option in town, the beloved Greek restaurant Opa! Opa!, announced that after 14 years in business it would be shuttering its doors. The owner said that since he first opened, prices have increased over 50 percent as a result of burdensome mandates placed on him by the state. Now, fourteen employees are left jobless right before the holidays.
These aren’t just anecdotes. Census Bureau data suggests the state’s restaurant owners have reacted to scaled-up wage costs by scaling back on hiring. In Los Angeles County, for instance, year-over-year full-service employment growth topped seven percent as recently as 2012; it’s fallen every year since then, and dipped below one percent in 2018. In Orange County, growth last year was near-zero.
A similar trend is seen statewide, with sub-one percent growth replacing five percent growth from as recently as 2013. In San Francisco County, stagnant growth turned negative last year, with the city losing nearly 1,000 restaurant jobs. A study published by Harvard University Business School and Mathematica examined the impacts of wage increases in the San Francisco Bay Area. The results were startling. The research found that each one dollar increase to the minimum wage resulted in a 14 percent increase in the likelihood that a 3.5 star (the median rating) restaurant would be forced to close.
Another study, recently released by my organization, found that in states like California with a high minimum wage for tipped employees, full-service restaurants hired 18 percent fewer tipped workers as a share of the workforce. In practice, that means full-service restaurants embrace self-service alternatives where the customer provides much of the service themselves. (The New York Times chronicled a trend in San Francisco of fine-dining restaurants adopting elements of fast-food style service models.)
Will California legislators wise up? Don’t hold your breath.
The state’s Future of Work Commission, which was assembled by the governor to examine future workplace challenges for employers and employees, is stacked with some of the very parties responsible for those challenges. SEIU president Mary Kay Henry, who co-chairs the governor’s commission, has overseen more than $100 million in spending on the Fight for $15, a policy that has forced countless employers to replace human employees with automated alternatives. Another commission member, labor activist Saru Jayaraman, has encouraged other states to follow California’s failed payment model for tipped employees. She’s been opposed in that goal by thousand of tipped servers, who understand the consequences for their own bottom line should their states make California’s mistake.
Gov. Newsom boasts that California is setting an example for the rest of the country to follow. He’s right; the state is showing the rest of the country why a $15 minimum wage is a bad idea.

When Donald Trump ran for president in 2016, U.S. Sen. Susan Collins of Maine refused to vote for him.
Denouncing him for mocking the vulnerable and attacking “ethnic and religious minorities,” she wrote in House Speaker Paul Ryan instead, a choice that didn’t even register in the final results since the Wisconsin Republicans hadn’t registered as any sort of candidate in Maine.
But it appears that Trump, unusually for him, isn’t holding a grudge.
<img class="size-full wp-image-13570818" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2019/12/trumptweet.jpg" alt="" width="512" height="332" />
U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham recently issued a tweet recently hailing Collins, a four-term Republican, for showing “unbelievable courage” during the bitter confirmation fight surrounding U.S. Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh last year “and at other times when our country has needed a steady voice.”
“We need her to ensure a GOP majority in 2020,” Graham wrote, and urged his supporters to send money to Collins’ campaign. He also linked to her recent reelection announcement.
On Monday evening, Trump retweeted Graham’s words and added a few of his own.
“I agree 100%!” Trump said.
It marks one of the few times that Trump has directly praised Collins, who has proven a presidential ally on some key issues and a thorn in his side on others, especially in her 2017 vote to block repeal of the Affordable Care Act.
The day after her speech in favor of Kavanaugh in September 2018, Trump told reporters he “thought that Susan was incredible yesterday.”
Collins has avoided saying anything about whether she’ll endorse Trump in 2020, focusing instead on what she perceives as the need to work with him on matters of national importance.
While she hasn’t taken a stand on the presidential race next year — which is bound to have a major impact on her effort to win a fifth term — she also hasn’t retracted any of the harsh comments she issued about Trump in a 2016 column for The Washington Post.
Collins has expressed distaste for Trump’s tweets on a number of occasions, occasionally denouncing some as over the line and sometimes simply wishing he would stop using the social media platform.
It isn’t clear whether Trump has ever referred to Collins so directly before on Twitter.
In 2018, he blasted a bipartisan immigration bill she cosponsored, claiming it would be “a total catastrophe” for the nation.
Generally, though, he’s avoided mentioning her.
He’s retweeted or touted U.S. Rep. Doug Collins, a Georgia Republican, dozens of times. He’s even assailed Gail Collins, a New York Times columnist, more often than he’s ever referred to Maine’s senior senator.
One of the Democrats hoping to unseat Collins in Maine’s election next year, Betsy Sweet of Hallowell, said on Twitter on Tuesday there’s a reason Trump and Graham want Collins to return to the Senate in 2021: “Because they know she’ll take the side of Republican special interests, not the people of Maine.”

Weinstein is living the good life, ankle monitor notwithstanding

Texto completo: Harvey Weinstein, once one of the most brash and powerful men in Hollywood, has lately been having issues with his ankle bracelet.
The shunned former movie producer is wearing a court-ordered monitor while he awaits trial for allegedly raping one woman and forcing another to let him perform a sex act on her.
Last week, a Manhattan prosecutor told a judge that the tracking device on Mr. Weinstein's ankle had stopped transmitting at least 57 times during a two-month period.
"These were not technical glitches in any shape or form. Mr. Weinstein did not want people to know where he was," asserted the prosecutor, Joan Illuzzi-Orbon.
Mr. Weinstein's attorney said the ankle monitor randomly quit working because of dead batteries and shaky wireless connections. The hearing ended when the judge doubled Mr. Weinstein's bail to $2 million, which Mr. Weinstein promptly secured with stocks and other equities.
Such are the problems of super-rich sexual predators, trying to decide which seven-figure assets to post with your bondsman.
Mr. Weinstein, 67, was notorious in the entertainment world long before his monstrous behavior was chronicled in the New Yorker magazine and New York Times, igniting the #MeToo movement.
He got away with it so long because he could wreck young careers - and threatened to do just that. So people feared him. What finally brought him down were brave women who agreed to go public.
Unlike the late Jeffrey Epstein, Mr. Weinstein has so far been able to sleep in his own bed and avoid the indignities of incarceration. However, if convicted of the most serious criminal charges, he could be in prison the rest of his life.
Mr. Weinstein also has been sued in civil courts by more than 30 actresses and former employees who say he assaulted or harassed them.
Three of his most well-known accusers - Salma Hayek, Gwyneth Paltrow and Angelina Jolie - have spoken up but not joined the lawsuits.
Mr. Weinstein's lawyers say he's looking forward to clearing his name. On the same day he faced the judge about his ankle monitor, another set of attorneys was working to finalize a $25 million settlement with dozens of his alleged victims.
Eighteen of the women would divide $6.2 million, and another $18.5 million would be earmarked for others who are part of a class-action suit and for future claimants.
Still, the deal would be a coup for Mr. Weinstein and the board of his now-bankrupt movie studio. Under the proposed terms, the money paid to the women would come not from Mr. Weinstein's pocket but, rather, from the insurance companies representing the studio.
The total package of $47 million would also generously include $12 million to cover some of the legal expenses for Mr. Weinstein, his brother Bob and other former members of the board.
As a capper, the settlement would not require Mr. Weinstein to admit any wrongdoing.
Some of the women who've signed off on the settlement have said they're displeased, but they also know it could be their last shot at being compensated. Mr. Weinstein reportedly might soon file for personal bankruptcy - even though prosecutors say he has sold $60 million worth of real estate in New York.
Not all of Mr. Weinstein's accusers will participate in the settlement. An attorney for TV producer Alexandra Canosa, who has stated that Mr. Weinstein raped and threatened her, said there is "nothing fair or just" about the agreement.
It's natural to be incensed by a deal that allows a wealthy creep to slither off without paying the victims any of his own money, or even acknowledging responsibility for the pain he has caused.
But settling a messy civil lawsuit is different than beating sexual assault charges in criminal court.
True, most predators aren't rich and surrounded by smart lawyers - but ask Bill Cosby if that's always helpful when your victims are on the witness stand, telling their stories to a jury.
The fact is, Mr. Weinstein probably will never admit what he's done, much less apologize. He'll continue to insist that many of his accusers are making up incidents that never occurred and that the rest of them had sex with him consensually.
Mr. Weinstein's trial is set for Jan. 6. In the meantime, he remains free, staying at home in the New York suburb of Bedford.
His lawyers have assured the judge that their famous client isn't going anywhere.
They said he's actually hired someone to help him make sure that his ankle monitor is working properly.

Texto completo: Under a government regulation, teachers at some international schools face intrusive questions aimed at identifying those with "abnormal" sexual orientations.
JAKARTA, Indonesia -- Agree or disagree, the exam asked: "I would feel uncomfortable knowing my daughter's or son's teacher was homosexual."
Or this, true or false: "The gender composition of an orgy would be irrelevant to my decision to participate."
In recent weeks, foreign teachers at some private schools in Indonesia have been required to answer these questions and many more like them in what has been billed as a psychological exam.
The goal is to determine teachers' sexual orientation and attitude toward gay rights under a 2015 government regulation that prohibits international schools from hiring foreign teachers who have "an indication of abnormal sexual behavior or orientation."
"For foreign teachers, if the psychologist declares that a candidate has a deviant sexual orientation, certainly the school will not hire that person," said Waadarrahman, an official with the Ministry of Education and Culture. Like many Indonesians, she uses one name.
The test comes as lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transgender people face growing hostility across Indonesia, which was once seen as among the most tolerant countries in the Islamic world. Officially secular, Indonesia has the world's largest Muslim population.
In September, Parliament came close to passing an overhaul of the criminal code that would have effectively outlawed gay and lesbian relations. A similar proposal is expected to come up in the new year.
In Bekasi Regency, which adjoins the capital city, Jakarta, the Child Protection Agency said this month that it had used police records to identify 4,000 people who suffer from the "disease" of being lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender.
Promoting theories debunked in the West, the agency's commissioner, Mohamad Rojak, told reporters that "the majority of sexual disorientation" was caused by "carefree lifestyles" and urged the people on his list to overcome their condition by getting "therapy."
The crackdown on L.G.B.T. people in Indonesian workplaces extends beyond schools. The office of Indonesia's attorney general, which is responsible for enforcing laws against discrimination, last month said on its website that job applicants must not have "sexual orientation disorders" or "behavioral deviations."
"We just want the normal ones," a spokesman for the attorney general's office, Mukri, told reporters. "We don't want the odd ones."
Homosexuality is currently not illegal in Indonesia except in the autonomous province of Aceh, where gays and lesbians can be caned under Shariah, the Islamic legal code.
But the country's new vice president, Ma'ruf Amin, formerly a leading Islamic cleric, has long supported criminalization and harsh punishment of gays and lesbians.
The teacher-testing requirement was adopted after a contentious 2014 case in which a Canadian educator and six Indonesians were accused of sexually abusing young students at the prestigious Jakarta International School.
All seven were convicted and sentenced to long prison terms on the basis of preposterous evidence, including that the Canadian, Neil Bantleman, used magical powers to seduce the children and render the crime scenes invisible. He was granted clemency in June and freed after serving five years.
Officials say one purpose of the testing regulation was to prevent foreign pedophiles from being hired as teachers. But the psychological exam questions reviewed by The New York Times focus instead on sexual orientation and attitudes toward homosexuality.
Ms. Waadarrahman, the education ministry official, said the regulation applies to 168 schools, including the renamed Jakarta Intercultural School, that offer an international curriculum.
Many of the schools attract wealthy Indonesians who want their children to have access to an international education with Advanced Placement or International Baccalaureate programs.
The Jakarta Intercultural School's headmaster, Tarek Razik, declined to comment on the regulation or how the school handles the psychological screening of its teachers.
The recent wave of testing has alarmed some foreign teachers who are concerned that schools or government officials are seeking to remove teachers who may be gay or lesbian.
But teachers who were critical of the test declined to speak out publicly for fear of losing their jobs.
Under the regulation, the schools are required to have a psychologist certify that each teacher does not have a behavior disorder or an "abnormal sexual orientation."
Enforcement of the regulation, however, is haphazard. Each school is left to hire a psychologist to conduct the teacher certification process, which is required both before a teacher is hired and every six years when a school's accreditation is renewed.
There is no standardized exam. The testing procedure is left to individual schools and some versions of the exam are more intrusive than others.
One school that administered the test last month was the Mentari Intercultural School in Jakarta.
The exam included many behavioral questions, at least 38 of which dealt with sexual orientation and attitudes toward gay rights, according to pages of the test provided to The New York Times.
While the intention of the regulation might have been to root out predators, many of the questions covered attitudes toward gay rights.
For example, agree or disagree:
"A sexual education curriculum should include all sexual orientations."
"Celebrations such as gay pride day are ridiculous because they assume an individual's sexual orientation should constitute a source of pride."
"Teachers should try to reduce their student's prejudice toward homosexuality."
Many questions appeared to be derived from the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory, which is designed to assess personality traits and psychopathology. Other questions aimed to show where each teacher fit on the Kinsey Scale of sexual orientation.
Many of the questions were personal. These were asked of men:
"I wouldn't want to die without having experimented sexually with both men and women."
"I can be sexually attracted to anyone in the right circumstances."
"I am only attracted to men."
Mentari school officials did not respond to questions about the test.
A psychologist in the city of Bandung, Ifa H. Misbach, said she declined a school's request to prepare such an exam because it would be unethical for members of her profession to engage in discriminatory practices.
"It is weird for me, in my humble opinion," she said in an interview. "Psychologists cannot discriminate on the basis of sexuality."
She noted that attitudes toward homosexuality are very conservative in Indonesia, where being gay is widely seen as a choice, not a characteristic determined by birth.
"It is different from American culture," she said. "Every day they have to hide from a society that judges them badly."
Discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation in hiring is "against Indonesia's constitution, and against Indonesia's obligations under international human rights law," said Usman Hamid, director of Amnesty International Indonesia.
The advocacy director for the Support Group and Resource Center on Sexuality Studies, Riska Carolina, said gays and lesbians face increasing government obstacles in many areas of society, including barriers to scholarships or high-profile positions in sports programs.
"The pattern is clear," she said. "If there are groups that are considered different, they get excluded instead of getting taken care of."

Longtime linguists will choose word of decade

Texto completo: One word was used to epitomize the entire 20th century.
Was it "progress," to mark the march of civilization from buggies to astronauts and the iPhone?
Maybe "upheaval," to delineate genocides and civic unrest?
No. Try "jazz," to describe not only music, but the sweep and swing of the quintessential American century, and the cultural flows that invigorated it.
Who gets to decide such weighty, wordy things? The little-known American Dialect Society, or ADS, founded in 1889, and dedicated to the study of the English language in North America.
ADS has been picking a word of the year since 1990, longer than any other entity. Its members selected "jazz" from dozens of possible words in January 2000.
Now fast forward to the first week of 2020, when 300 to 400 of the society's language scholars are expected to meet in New Orleans to determine the word of 2019, as well as the even more consequential word of the decade that ends on New Year's Eve. The word of the previous decade, by the way, was "google," meaning "to search the internet."
A fun bunch that's not as tweedy or as uptight as you might think, society folks are known for their passionate, sometimes raucous, conclaves in which culture, politics, art and technology are distilled to their dense essence - a single word or phrase freighted with enough punch and validity to capture the zeitgeist.
"We keep our finger on the pulse of words in America," said ADS member Dennis Preston, a linguist from Oklahoma State University. "We don't take ourselves too seriously, and we do it with a certain amount of whimsy.
"But never forget: Human language carries enormous meaning and symbolism."
Along with the ADS, dictionary publishers also pick words of the year. Recently, Dictionary.com determined that the word of 2019 was "existential," relating to world events involving climate change, gun violence and changing democratic institutions.
Last month, Oxford Dictionaries selected "climate emergency." 
"They're just imitators," sniffed Preston, who, at 80, believes he can get away with spewing tartly outrageous trash talk. "I'm happy Dictionary.com exercised their First Amendment rights coming up with 'existential.' But the authentic word of the year will be chosen by the American Dialect Society. Nothing is so flattering as imitation."
Many people in the word-of-the-year business rely on reams of data to determine what popular words were looked up on search engines or were trending on Twitter in any given year, noted Ben Zimmer, the internationally known linguist and language columnist for The Wall Street Journal, who once penned the "On Language" column for The New York Times Magazine.
But, said Zimmer, who is chair of the New Words Committee of the ADS, the society's words are harvested during nominating sessions followed by lively debates and show-of-hands votes.
"It's basically from hundreds of language scholars who have a pretty keen eye on the way language develops," Zimmer said. "We've never had fights. But discussions definitely become animated."
The words of the year chosen by the ADS are not necessarily new words; they could be old ones used in new ways, said Marianna Di Paolo, emeritus linguistics professor and ADS member from the University of Utah. One example is "occupy," connected to the 2011 Occupy Wall Street protest against economic inequality.
"We observe what words have been salient," she said.
During the last decade, the words of each year have bubbled out of the high-boiling soup of turbulent and tech-conscious times:
"App" in 2010. "Occupy" in 2011. "Hashtag" in 2012. "Because X" (a modern construction illustrated by the example, "Why would men wear capes? Because fashion") in 2013.
"#BlackLivesMatter" in 2014. "They" as a singular pronoun in 2015. "Dumpster fire" (describing election-related "public discourse and preoccupations") in 2016. "Fake news" in 2017. Last year, "tender-age shelter" (a euphemism referencing the facilities in which some immigrant children were separated from their parents). It beat out "the wall" (at the southern border).
The word of the decade won't necessarily be one of the yearly winners, Zimmer said. The ADS draws up lists of candidates that may not become words of the year, but might still have a shot at being the 2010-19 representative.
There are "most likely to succeed" words, thought to have legs beyond any single year, such as "ghost," a verb from 2015 meaning to abruptly end a relationship by cutting off communication, especially online.
Other possibilities include "mansplaining" (let a woman define it for you); "selfie"; "Obamacare"; and the Generation Z exclamation "yeet," among many more examples.
Just for fun, the ADS likes to make lists of "most unnecessary" words, which definitely won't represent the decade. These include "manbun" (a man's hair pulled into a bun); "baeless" (without a bae, or romantic partner); and "sharknado" (a tornado full of sharks, as featured in the Syfy Channel movie of that name).
Asked what he thinks the word of the decade will be, Zimmer was initially noncommittal, then added, "I wouldn't be surprised if 'they' as a singular pronoun does very well," he said.

Living in the 'golden age of crosswords'

Texto completo: In 1924, the U.K.-based newspaper The Tamworth Herald warned of a dangerous craze that had "enslaved" the United States.
The paper described a "menace ... making devastating inroads on the working hours of every rank of society." People were "shamelessly" participating at all hours of the day. It was dealing "the final blow to the art of conversation."
The culprit? Crossword puzzles.
Yep, crossword puzzles, those grids of black-and-white blocks and often pun-ny clues that appear in the pages of newspapers. They were all the rage in the 1920s, until the nationwide fad eventually died along with the Charleston and pole sitting.
Nearly a century later and we're in the "golden age of crosswords." Or so says Will Shortz. He should know: Shortz has been the editor of the storied New York Times crossword puzzle since 1993, and before that worked at Games magazine for 15 years.
"They have never been as popular, with the possible exception of 1924," Shortz, who lives in Pleasantville, in Westchester County, New York, told NorthJersey.com. "Now crosswords are more up to date, they're livelier, they feel more modern. I think they're attracting a wider audience than ever."
'A good kind of torture' Once upon a time crossword fans had to rely on newspapers, magazines or published puzzle books to get their fix. Now you can solve on your tablet or phone via apps, or subscription-based sites like The Inkubator and Fireball Crosswords can send them to your inbox. You can sign up for Queer Crosswords or Women of Letters by donating to specific charities.
"Now there are so many other options and venues," said Anna Gundlach, a puzzle fan and crossword constructor who lives in Portland, Oregon. "A lot of the distribution channels are able to be bypassed entirely."
The proliferation of independent crossword puzzles means a wider range of clues and answers and more provocative content. Puzzle editors at the New York Times reject puzzles if they decide a clue or answer is too obscure. Gundlach said the paper passed on one of hers because it referenced Bell Biv DeVoe.
"The American Values Club, which I've done a crossword for recently, has a more Gen X, millennial bent to it," she said. "Fresher clues, not afraid to swear or talk about sex."
Gundlach has had a nearly lifelong puzzle obsession. For Howard Barkin, a love of crosswords came late. He started solving them in his early 30s during lunch breaks to get his mind off work. Now he's 45 and a legit crossword puzzle champion. Barkin, who lives in Somerset County, New Jersey, finished first place in the 2016 American Crossword Puzzle Tournament in Stamford, Connecticut.
Shortz is the director for the contest, which pits the best crossword solvers against one another in seven games over the course of a weekend, culminating in a final round for the three finalists. Barkin's tournament victory came after solving the last puzzle in seven minutes and 49 seconds.
The stress level was high, Barkin said.
"Most people aren't used to solving a crossword with a timer counting down in a room full of 500 people," he said.
Barkin also constructs crosswords when he frees up time between doing dishes and raising two young daughters. He said his favorite to solve involve "extremely evil" tricks.
"A puzzle that breaks the rules, but for a good reason," he said. "A puzzle where you have to write a Greek letter into a square or something. It's a good kind of torture."
'Wow us' Even with a host of alternatives, the gold standard crossword remains the one The New York Times publishes.
"It's capital T, capital C: The Crossword," Gundlach said. "When people talk about 'the Sunday crossword' or 'the Friday crossword,' that's generally assumed to be the New York Times crossword."
Crossword fans use the hashtag #NYTXW on Twitter to brag about their finish times and offer their often-harsh criticism of that day's puzzle. The Dec. 12 crossword elicited reviews like "Ugh. So Bible heavy and then that twist? No." and "Ok #NYTXW sorry I don't know the ATOMIC NUMBER of NEODYMIUM?!?!"
The paper's associate puzzles editor, Sam Ezersky, doesn't take that kind of criticism personally. His Facebook banner photo is a foul-mouthed pan of one of his crossword puzzles.
"It's an obsessive culture," Ezersky said. "I get being so passionate about something like this."
Ezersky grew up in a D.C. suburb as a puzzles fanatic and sold his first crossword puzzle to the Los Angeles Times when he was 16 years old. He's 24 now, lives in Hoboken and spends his days sifting through some of the roughly 600 crossword puzzle submissions the New York Times receives monthly (via snail mail only). Some he turns down with nothing more than a glance. Either the grid is an odd pattern, or the words are meh.
"We're just looking for fresh things that really capture our attention," he said. "These days we really need the puzzles to wow us."
Ezersky does not construct puzzles as much as he used to, but he snagged a dream assignment this year, creating the annual "super mega" crossword that ran Sunday in the New York Times' special puzzles section. It was a massive undertaking: a 50x50-square grid with 708 answers. It's so big the clues are printed on a separate page. Ezersky estimates it took hundreds of hours to construct. Still, he would have begged to do it if necessary.
"I know there were other constructors that declined because it's a such a Herculean task," he said. "If I could have been totally no filter and not cared about professionality, I would have been like, 'Please please please please please.'"
An Ezersky crossword from August shows how his mind works when he puzzles out a puzzle. He began with the across answer at the bottom left, where he placed "tech savvy." He then stacked "heist film" right on top, giving himself the unenviable challenge of finding a down answer that ends with "lv." He did: "capital V."
Once the grid is done, he dreams up clues. He clued "tech savvy" with "E-sharp?" — that question mark is crossword-ese indicating there's a joke or pun involved — and asked readers to get to "capital V" with the clue "Symbol for 54-down." The answer there was "volts."
Constructing crossword puzzles can be agonizing, Ezersky said, but he wouldn't want any other job.
"My mantra to myself is I'm just getting started," he said. "I'm just humbled and grateful to be doing what I'm doing."

Texto completo: A reporter who has covered the tech industry for more than two decades explains how we may be entering a progressive era of antitrust.
Each week, we review the week's news , offering analysis about the most important developments in the tech industry.
Hello, my name is Steve Lohr. I cover technology and economics for The New York Times, and I'm this week's tour guide through recent tech news.
One of the big stories of the year has been the Big Tech companies becoming targets of major antitrust investigations by the nation's federal enforcement agencies, Congress and states. The concern is not only the companies' market power but also how they handle personal data, spread disinformation and amplify partisan divisions.
To someone who has covered technology and antitrust for The Times for more than two decades, this period seems different than anything I've seen before. To me, it raises a question: Are we entering a new, progressive era in antitrust?
The answer to that question matters a lot. The official scrutiny of the big tech companies -- Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple -- is just getting underway. Whether it results in meaningful curbs on the companies will depend in good part on the persistence of the investigators.
Investigations have a way of finding things. And the institutional commitment to antitrust, or lack of it, will be shaped by economics, ideas, politics and public opinion.
There are intriguing parallels with the progressive era of the late 19th and early 20th century: growing gaps in wealth, concentration of markets and a perceived threat to democracy.
Then, the technology engine was the industrial revolution. Today, it is the digital revolution. Then, the targets of enforcement were the industrial trusts, led by Standard Oil. Today, it is the digital behemoths. Then, the policy response was new antitrust laws -- the Sherman Act of 1890 and the Clayton Act of 1914 -- and aggressive enforcement. Today, the policy response remains to be seen.
While reporting recent stories and a few interviews last week, I've been struck by two things: the very different climate now compared with the one surrounding the antitrust case against Microsoft in the 1990s, and the extent of the bipartisan support for pursuing the big tech companies.
The Microsoft investigation and trial, which I covered, was fairly narrowly focused. It was about market dominance and the software giant's tactics to stifle innovation.
The second half of the 1990s, when the Justice Department and a group of states investigated and then filed a major antitrust suit against Microsoft, were banner years economically. It was not only a period of strong overall growth but a time when productivity rose. For a few years, income gaps narrowed.
Microsoft was a purely economic case. "But now we're seeing an evolution in antitrust, to take in greater social and political concerns, as well as economics," said Maurice Stucke, a former Justice Department antitrust official and a professor at the University of Tennessee College of Law. "Antitrust is starting to capture the public imagination in a way that Microsoft never did."
Current antitrust thinking is expanding to take in matters like the control of data and privacy. Since the 1980s, a central focus of antitrust has been a dominant company's power to increase prices. But there is a lively debate now about so-called nonprice components of competition. A loss of privacy to a data-harvesting giant like Facebook or Google, for example, can be cast as reducing the quality of the service and thus as a signal of monopoly power.
"Nothing's free," Makan Delrahim, head of the Justice Department's antitrust division, said at the Times's DealBook conference last month. "If consumers think they're getting any service for free, they're being misled."
Data, Mr. Delrahim explained, is an asset for internet companies, and gathering and analyzing large amounts of personal data is not necessarily a problem. But digital data, he added, "can give you market power. And its abuse would be a violation of antitrust law."
In the last couple of weeks, Representative Doug Collins, Republican of Georgia, who is the ranking minority member of the House Judiciary Committee, has been a fixture on cable TV news as a hyperventilating, partisan opponent of impeachment. But in an interview last month for an article on a Judiciary subcommittee's antitrust investigation of the big tech companies, Mr. Collins was a voice of bipartisan reason.
Mr. Collins is less critical of the tech giants than the Democrat leading the inquiry, Representative David Cicilline of Rhode Island. And he dismisses the calls to break up the companies from the Democratic presidential candidates Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders.
But Mr. Collins supports the House investigation. And he thinks that consumers should be given greater control over how the tech giants use their data and that the companies should be prevented from buying up nascent competitors. "Those are genuine concerns of mine," he said.
Barry Lynn, executive director of the Open Markets Institute, a research and advocacy group, points to the states' investigation of Google, joined by 50 attorneys general and led by Ken Paxton, a conservative Republican attorney general in Texas, as a sign of the changing times in antitrust. An investigation of Facebook, led by Letitia James, the attorney general of New York and a Democrat, has nearly as many supporting states.
"The environment is radically different than it was even a year or two ago," Mr. Lynn said. "It's a grass-roots rebellion against concentrated power."
But whether shifting sentiments will translate to a pendulum swing in antitrust, reminiscent of the progressive era of a century ago, is uncertain at best. Major enforcement actions would be challenged in court. For years, the courts have generally embraced the "consumer welfare" standard -- typically, though not always, dependent on higher prices. The courts have also been guided by the assumption that markets are self-correcting.
"I think antitrust should move, but it will really take the alignment of a lot of stars to move this ship," said Andrew Gavil, a law professor at Howard University.

On crucial Trump-era test, media stumbled

Texto completo: The most telling moment of how the media covered impeachment may have come, oddly enough, on Fox News.
Todd Piro of 'Fox - Friends' " President Trump's most reliable cheerleading squad " was interviewing residents of Battle Creek, Mich., the morning after the House of Representatives passed two articles of impeachment.
He stuck his microphone in front of a middle-aged white woman identified as Carol.
Would the impeachment hurt or help the president in the 2020 election, Piro inquired?-
She was succinct: 'I think it'll help him among people who don't care about facts.'
Piro mustered a quick 'all right' and moved on.
Carol, though, in a dozen words, had put her finger on something: Not everybody seems focused on the facts. And sadly, some of those who aren't are members of the mainstream media.
Six weeks ago " before Marie Yovanovitch's stunning testimony, before Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's appalling statement that he would work hand in hand with the White House on a Senate trial strategy, before House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's 'don't you dare' glare at her own members " I urged the news media to rise to the most difficult challenge of the Trump era so far.
Their test was to cover the impeachment proceedings without getting mired in the usual traps: false equivalence; distraction by presidential stunt; rampant speculation; the use of squishy language; and what I called Barr-Letter Syndrome, a reference to the way the mainstream press allowed Attorney General William P. Barr last spring to mischaracterize the findings of the Mueller report.
Now that Trump has been impeached, it's not possible to say that the mainstream media has earned anything close to an A.
Nor did they flunk out. Here's a look.
Equating the unequal: In an unceasing effort to be seen as neutral, journalists time after time fell into the trap of presenting facts and lies as roughly equivalent and then blaming political tribalism for not seeming to know the difference.
'Too much coverage seems to have got stuck in a feedback loop,' wrote Jon Allsop in Columbia Journalism Review. 'We're telling the public that politicians aren't budging from their partisan siloes, and vice versa, with the facts of what Trump actually did getting lost somewhere in the cycle. The cult of 'both sides' is integral to this dynamic, and it's serving the impeachment story poorly.'
Other critics, including the Atlantic's James Fallows, NYU's Jay Rosen and Dan Froomkin of Press Watch, among others, pointed particularly at the New York Times.
However, the problem is broader and deeper. Watch the broadcast evening news for a couple of nights in a row and, to varying degrees, you'll see it in action: The Democrats said this; the Republicans said that; we don't know " it's so tribal! " so you decide.
The 'pizazz' and 'polarization' problems: The first hearings, featuring State Department officials William B. Taylor Jr. and George Kent, failed to provide adequate thrills for some, despite their helpfulness in establishing that Trump had strong-armed Ukraine for political favors.
Some news organizations seemed to join with President Trump in dubbing them dull " a '#snoozefest' as his son Eric saw it.
NBC News tweeted that the first hearings lacked 'pizazz,' and though this was mockable enough to create an Internet meme, it did speak to a serious issue: the expectation that every major news event should offer drama in the style of a reality TV show.
Author Jennifer Weiner warned in a Times opinion piece: 'If we keep insisting that impeachment has to entertain us, we're going to channel-surf our way right out of our democracy.'
When that excitement level isn't met, the media often steps in to provide it. That takes the form of dramatizing the nation's polarization, compete with laments about 'divided America.' But, as lawyer and commenter David A. Love put it, that's both accurate and a flawed lens: 'When part of the nation supports authoritarianism . . . I'd hope there's some division. It's not like we're arguing over what we're having for dinner.'
What went right: For Americans who were truly interested and willing to do some of the work of being informed, the facts underlying impeachment " and plenty of opinions " were readily available. They might have had to do some comparing and contrasting of news outlets and varying views, and to pay careful attention to the hearings themselves.
That was fully possible.
The broadcast networks rightly abandoned a great deal of their regular programming to air day after day of hearings. CBS Evening News, which recently moved to Washington from New York, gave its full 30-minute broadcast on Wednesday to impeachment coverage.
The four national newspapers gave the hearings voluminous coverage for weeks " and their editorial boards eventually all wrote in support or opposition. The Washington Post, USA Today and the Times all made strong cases for impeachment. By contrast, the Wall Street Journal, whose board has steadily opposed impeachment, took a swipe at the 'impeachment press' and went further: 'Based on the House evidence, Senators are justified in voting to acquit without hearing anyone.'
Coverage aplenty. Opinions unending.
As for plain old facts " like the ones mentioned by Carol in Battle Creek?
You certainly could find them amid the lush forest of words and views, but you might have to cut through a lot of brush first.

Democrats are cautious about ideas on far left

Texto completo: Progressive policy ideas have dominated the early stages of the Democratic primary campaign. But Democratic voters may be seeking more moderate options.
Only 1 in 4 Democratic voters said they would favor eliminating private health insurance and replacing it with a government-run plan — the centerpiece of the “Medicare for All" proposals put forward by Senators Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. And only 1 in 3 favors making public college tuition free for all Americans regardless of income, another idea shared by the two leading progressives in the race.
Those results, from a survey conducted this month for The New York Times by the online research firm SurveyMonkey, are striking because past polls, including those from the Times, have shown broad-based support for progressive ideas among Democrats. Last month, 81 percent of Democrats said they approved of Medicare for All; in July, 82 percent said they supported making public colleges free for all.
But those earlier surveys asked simple yes-or-no questions. The most recent survey offered respondents more options to choose from. And it found that Democratic voters consistently preferred policies that were well to the left of current law but were more moderate than those proposed by Sanders and Warren.
Most Democrats, for example — 58 percent — said they would like to make government-run insurance universally available while allowing people to keep their private insurance if they prefer it, a policy similar to the “Medicare for all who want it" plan proposed by Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., and a related proposal from former vice president Joe Biden. A further 15 percent said the United States should reform the health care system without adopting a government-run plan at all, or that the current system was working well. Only 25 percent said they would prefer a Medicare for All plan that eliminated private insurance.
The preference for more moderate policies cuts across age groups, races, education levels, and even ideology: Among Democrats who said they were “liberal" or “very liberal," only 30 percent chose the most progressive option for health care reform.
The Times survey showed similar results when it came to “free college" proposals. About one-third of Democrats said that the government should make public colleges free to low- and moderate-income families but that the wealthy should still have to pay — again, a policy close to that proposed by Buttigieg. Another third said that college should be more affordable but that most families should have to pay something. The remaining third expressed the most liberal position, that college should be free for all.
New York Times
Key Democratic senator undecided on Trump
Senator Doug Jones of Alabama, who won a special election victory in 2017 and faces a difficult reelection campaign next year, said Sunday that he remains undecided on whether President Trump should be removed from office.
Jones, a former prosecutor and moderate Democrat representing a deeply conservative state that overwhelming backed Trump's presidential campaign in 2016, said he is keeping his mind open ahead of the pending Senate trial, following the House's vote to impeach the president last week.
Jones and other Democrats who represent states won by Trump, such as Senator Joe Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia, and Senator Gary Peters, Democrat of Michigan, are seen by top Republican strategists as possible swing votes in a Senate trial.
But Jones is considered by party leaders to be the most vulnerable Senate Democrat ahead of the 2020 campaign season, because Trump defeated Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton by 28 percentage points in Alabama.
Republicans who are being monitored ahead of a Senate trial include Senators Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, and Mitt Romney of Utah, according to two GOP officials who were not authorized to speak publicly.
The Republican primary race to challenge Jones is crowded. Former attorney general and former senator Jeff Sessions has launched a comeback bid, and Representative Bradley Byrne is also running, as are former Auburn University football coach Tommy Tuberville and Roy Moore, among others.

Buttigieg leads 2020 rivals in Wall Street contributions
The financial sector, blamed by progressives for spawning the 2008 economic collapse, is lining up behind Pete Buttigieg's presidential campaign.
The mayor of South Bend, Ind., has collected more campaign cash from donors and political action committees tied to the financial, insurance, and real estate sector than any other White House hopeful, according to data compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics.
The $3.06 million in contributions compares with $2.8 million directed toward former vice president Joe Biden and $2.03 million for Senator Cory Booker, whose home state of New Jersey has strong ties to Wall Street.
While Buttigieg is hardly alone in turning to the finance industry for support, the data could leave him exposed to further attacks from his progressive rivals, especially Senator Elizabeth Warren. The Massachusetts Democrat repeatedly hit Buttigieg during Thursday's presidential debate for his ties to large donors.
Buttigieg's campaign said Friday it has returned a $5,000 donation from one of Wall Street's most prominent lawyers, H. Rodgin Cohen.
Buttigieg's team argues his campaign has broad support, noting his average donation was $32 for the third quarter if 2019 and that 98 percent of the donations are under $200. Buttigieg spokesman Sean Savett said the candidate is “proud to be running a campaign that's powered by more than 700,000 grassroots donors from across the country."

Texto completo: NEW YORK - Storm Marrero is the first Afro-Latina singing ringmaster for the Big Apple Circus, which is running through Feb. 2 next to Lincoln Center.
Marrero was born in Brooklyn, moved to Puerto Rico in her early teens, and then returned to New York in 2005, where she focused on her singing career, performing at venues like the burlesque supper club Duane Park. For the past five years Marrero, 43, has lived in a one-bedroom apartment in the Bronx. In May, her mother moved in with her.
HOME PREP I wake up at 8.1 take care of my mother, who has dementia. She's been up since 6 and makes Bustelo, which is strong Cuban coffee. Then I have a health shake. I prepare everything for my mom. I've cooked the day before, and everything is in bowls for her to heat up. It very hard caring for a parent who isn't well. I'm waiting for Medicare to kick in so that we can get a visiting attendant.
SHOW PREP I'm in an Uber by 10:30. It's a gift I give myself. If not, it's double the time to get to work, and I love the extra hour of sleep. I'm at Lincoln Center by 11, and go straight to wardrobe where I do my own makeup. Years of doing burlesque taught me makeup techniques like contouring and highlighting. It's also where I found my sense of worth as an entertainer because they accept you with open arms about being different and unique. Then I get into my costume.
IT'S SHOWTIME This is the wackiest, most wonderful job I've ever had. It's a fun group of people to work with. When the curtain opens at noon, it's electrifying. The five-minute mark before I go onstage is when my when my brain is on fire. I mentally go through the list of acts and what I'm supposed to do. Then I hear the kids' laughter, which is like magic. I'm still shocked by Jason, who does the Wheel of Death. It's exhilarating. He's jumping rope in the air on this massive rotating wheel and somehow he sustains himself in the air.
SECOND ACT During the 20-minute intermission, I drink water, rest my voice, retouch my makeup, close my eyes and then it's time for the second act, where I sing my third song, "La Vida Es un Carnaval," by Celia Cruz. I love watching the Latinos in the audience stand up and dance. My other favorite moment is the Aliev Troupe, which happens after the cats perform. It's humans catching each other in the air with their hands. There's no bar or trapeze. It's heart-racing, regal and jaw-dropping. The audience does a collective wooooo.
MEET AND GREET We close the show with introductions. Then I'm escorted to the concession area for photos with the audience. The outgoing kids come directly to me. The shy or scared ones hide behind their parents. Then there are the adults who come on their own. That's sweet because they still believe in the innocence.
COZY SPOT By 2:30 I'm starving. I change back into my clothing and get lunch at this deli a block away on Broadway. I get a mixed salad, aloe juice and chips. Then I hang out in wardrobe; the room is warm and quiet. I'm the youngest of eight, but I've always been a loner. I'm a local and everyone is from another state so they have a trailer where they eat or sleep. I answer texts and emails, and call my mother. Then I lay down on the floor with my coat under my head and close my eyes.
ONCE MORE At 3:15 the whole thing starts all over. I place water bottles strategically around the ring. I get into my costume and do my makeup. On Sunday we perform two shows; some days we do three. Most acts only come out once. I'm onstage for the full two hours so there's no way to escape. You have to be present.
BACK TO THE BRONX By 6 the second show ends. If I'm really exhausted I'll Uber home. If not, it's a 90-minute commute. I take the D train, get out at Yankee Stadium, then catch the bus to my home.
MOTHER/DAUGHTER TIME It's usually 8:30 when I walk in. I mentally prepare myself to talk with my mother, because she's easily agitated and paranoid. It's very sad to see this strong woman who raised us by herself act like this. For dinner I'll have a chicken or egg sandwich, chips and apple juice. Then we'll watch "Criminal Minds" or "Law & Order," which she loves. We fight about who is going to sleep in the bedroom. I want her to, because it's more comfortable, but there's no TV in there. If I win, I open up the couch and fall asleep by 11.

Texto completo: When Rita Moreno, Gina Torres and Laurie Hernandez were announced in October as grand marshals for the 131st Rose Parade, the selection was fitting.
Over the years, several past choices reflected California in some way. These three Latina women (a veteran Puerto Rican entertainer, Cuban-American actress, Puerto Rican-American Olympic gymnast) epitomize the 2020 “Power of Hope” theme in a state where Hispanics comprise the population’s largest ethnic group.
“Through their talent, efforts, persistence and dedication, they have achieved excellence and have given back to the world stories of hope, dreams fulfilled, dignity, respect and inspiration,” Laura Farber, the Tournament of Roses president, said about the trio in a statement.
A look at the careers and accomplishments of the 2020 grand marshals:
Rita Moreno — who turned 88 on Dec. 11 — was born in Puerto Rico and grew up in Long Island, N.Y. She started doing Spanish voice-overs for American films at age 11. A couple years later, Moreno scored her first Broadway role and was soon starring in multiple film, television and theater productions.
The multi-faceted entertainer is probably best known for the performances that netted Primetime Emmys (“The Muppet Show,” “The Rockford Files”), a Grammy (“The Electric Company”), an Oscar (1961’s “West Side Story”) and Tony (1975’s “The Ritz”) — putting Moreno in the rare EGOT club. She also won Golden Globe, Peabody, Kennedy Center, Presidential Medal of Freedom and National Medal of Arts awards.
During the 1970s and ’80s, Moreno did guest spots on “The Love Boat,” “The Golden Girls” and “Miami Vice.” Other notable TV appearances include “Where on Earth is Carmen Sandiego” (the animated series and its 2019 film version), “Oz,” “The Nanny,” “Law & Order: Criminal Intent,” “Ugly Betty,” “Grace and Frankie” and “One Day at a Time.” In late 2020, Moreno will be seen in the Steven Spielberg-directed film remake of “West Side Story,” starring Ansel Elgort.
Having participated in the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, famous for one of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s stirring speeches, Moreno still keeps active in social causes. Two years ago, she joined Jennifer Lopez, Gloria Estefan, Camila Cabello, Marc Anthony and others for the Hurricane Maria benefit single, “Almost Like Praying,” under the name Artists for Puerto Rico. The project was spearheaded by “Hamilton” creator Lin-Manuel Miranda.
Gina Torres , 50, is a Manhattan native who grew up in the Bronx. She started singing as a child, attended a performing arts high school in NYC, trained in jazz and opera and was in a gospel choir. Torres appeared in Broadway plays and musicals working with acclaimed theater legends Tommy Tune and Jerry Zaks.
But her main focus was acting, and the 1990s saw appearances on such TV programs as “Law & Order,” the daytime soap opera “One Life to Live,” “Xena: Warrior Princess,” “Hercules: the Legendary Journeys” and “La Femme Nikita.”
Since the 2000s, the Afro-Cuban actress has gained a reputation for taking tough, confident female roles. She added some big screen work, notably with two of “The Matrix” sequels and more television appearances on “Alias,” “Firefly,” “CSI: Crime Scene Investigation,” “24,” “The Shield,” “Without a Trace,” “Boston Legal,” “Bones” “Criminal Minds” and “Gossip Girl.”
Astute gamers might recognize Torres’ voice work on “The Matrix” and “DC Universe” online, as well as the “Destiny” series and “Lego DC Super Villains.” More recent TV roles include “The Vampire Diaries,” “Hannibal,” “Westworld” and “The Catch.”
Torres spent seven seasons as Jessica Pearson, the co-founder of a law firm on USA Network’s “Suits” and then transitioned to the short-lived “Pearson” spinoff earlier this year. She is now recurring on “Riverdale.”
Laurie Hernandez , like Moreno, knows her way around the dance floor, from jive to cha-cha and tango. She won ABC’s “Dancing with the Stars” in 2016 with partner Val Chmerkovskiy. Hernandez is the youngest winner of the main competition to date.
The 19-year-old Hernandez is an Olympic medal-winning gymnast born in New Jersey to parents of Puerto Rican descent. As a member of the Final Five women’s team at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Hernandez won gold in the team event and silver on the balance beam.
A 2017 inductee into the USA Gymnastics Hall of Fame, she is currently training at Gym-Max in Costa Mesa with an eye toward making the U.S. team again for the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo.
Outside of gymnastics, Hernandez has authored “I Got This: To Gold and Beyond,” which covers her young life journey, and the children’s picture book “She’s Got This.” Both appeared on the New York Times Best Sellers list.
On television, she appeared on “Celebrity Family Feud” and co-hosted “America Ninja Warrior Junior” and also voiced the Valeria character on Nickelodeon’s “Middle School Moguls.”
Additionally, Hernandez serves as a global ambassador for STOMP Out Bullying, a prominent national bullying and cyberbullying prevention organization for children and teens.

Brodi Ashton: I started watching a famous Christmas movie and was immediately uncomfortable

Texto completo: The other day, my friend was shocked to learn that I’d never seen any of those old stop-motion Christmas movies like “Santa Claus is Comin’ to Town” and “Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.”
So, in one night, we vowed to watch all the Christmas movies.
We started with Rudolph, the story about the adorable little reindeer who is born with a red nose, which his embarrassed — but loving — parents insist he cover up, lest they be shamed by the community. The fake nose is uncomfortable for Rudolph, but his father reassures him by imparting such nuggets of wisdom like, “There are more important things than comfort. Self respect!”
Unfortunately, during a reindeer practice led by a coach who would make Bobby Knight look like Florence Nightingale, Rudolph’s fake nose falls off. The reindeer immediately recognize the usefulness of a teammate with a headlamp and take him into their fold and ... of course I’m kidding. He is forced to flee the North Pole with the town’s other outcast, an elf who’s shunned because he wants to be a dentist. (Which might be the reason North Poleians are known for their bad teeth).
The two encounter an older man and they all end up on an island of misfit toys whose population includes an elephant with spots and a ragdoll with depression.
Don’t worry. Santa eventually finds Rudolph useful.
Then we moved on to “Santa Claus is Comin’ to Town,” where the story arc takes place in a village called Sombertown which is occupied by bad guys, who, judging by the accents and uniforms, are Germans. Their only mode of transportation is goosestep.
Toys are outlawed in Sombertown because, I’m guessing, Germans don’t like fun? Anyway, never fear, Kris Kringle comes into town. He tells the kids he watches them while they’re awake and while they sleep, and then he spreads toys while singing, “If you sit on my lap today, a kiss a toy is the price you’ll pay.” And the price is non-negotiable.
After the small children kiss the old man, he is run out of town by the Germans — er, I mean, Burgermeister Meisterburger. So like any misunderstood older man who loves children and toys, Kringle sneaks back in, breaks into houses and forces toys upon the townsfolk, with no concern that their children will end up in a dungeon. Because handing out toys is more important than child imprisonment.
Then we moved on to “Home Alone,” where there are no working phones, no flights and the cops don’t care about abandoned children in jeopardy. After one such abandoned child, Kevin, burns his face with after-shave and makes a pizza delivery boy think he’s about to be shot and killed, he overhears two burglars say they are going to break into his house at 9 p.m. True to the burglars’ guild, they arrive as the clock is striking nine. They remain steadfast to their mission, despite stepping on nails, burning their scalps and getting clobbered in the face by hot irons and paint cans.
The moral of the story, I assume, is if you’re going to rob a house, be tenacious.
Last was “Holiday Inn,” a 1942 classic about an inn that was only open on holidays. It was filled with familiar songs, like the debut of a ditty called “White Christmas,” and another song about Abraham Lincoln… which was performed in black face.
So, uh… these classics hold up well. Enjoy your own favorites this holiday season, and may your days be merry and bright!

Texto completo: The House of Representatives impeached President Bill Clinton on Dec. 19, 1998. It was a Saturday. The votes, in which two articles of impeachment passed, were held around midday. By 3 p.m., the House had passed a resolution naming its impeachment managers, and those managers had physically delivered the articles to the Senate for trial.
Impeachment was on. The House, controlled by a Republican majority, was serious about its ultimately failed effort to remove Clinton from office.
Contrast that to today. On Wednesday, Dec. 18, at around 8 p.m., the Democratic-controlled House passed two articles of impeachment against President Trump. Speaker Nancy Pelosi immediately announced that the House would not appoint managers, and the articles would not be delivered to the Senate. The next day, Pelosi told reporters she did not want to talk any more about it, and the House went into recess until Jan. 7.
Impeachment was not on, or at least a Senate trial was not on. Pelosi was holding out, apparently, for better terms in a Senate trial.
That is where events stand today.
Pelosi acted after a Harvard professor and zealous impeachment advocate, Laurence Tribe, published an op-ed in the Washington Post arguing the Democratic strategy should be "voting for articles of impeachment but holding off for the time being on transmitting them to the Senate."
Withholding the articles, Tribe said, would strengthen Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer's hand as he negotiates with Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on the terms of the trial. It would do so, Tribe speculated, "because of McConnell's and Trump's urgent desire to get this whole business behind them."
Without McConnell's concessions, Tribe urged Democrats to withhold the articles indefinitely because a trial dominated by majority Republicans "would fail to render a meaningful verdict of acquittal."
It seemed a far-fetched idea, to be generous. McConnell and Senate Republicans would be perfectly happy if they never had to hold a trial; after all, they didn't impeach Trump. "I admit I'm not sure what leverage there is in refraining from sending us something we do not want," McConnell said drily.
After the weekly Senate Republican lunch, I asked one GOP lawmaker, via text, what the party's reaction was. He texted back a one-word answer: "Laughter."
Nevertheless, Tribe's idea took off like a rocket in some circles of the Democratic left. He published the article on Monday afternoon, and by Wednesday night, Pelosi had adopted his plan.
Just to be clear: Pelosi has no leverage at all over a Senate proceeding. The Constitution gives the House the "sole power" to impeach, a power Pelosi and her majority used to its fullest. But the Constitution gives the Senate the "sole power" to try all impeachments. The speaker of the House has no role.
Given that, Republicans have been wondering what Pelosi is up to. Crazy theories (at least, they seem to be crazy theories) have emerged. Democrats would impeach the president repeatedly. (That was actually a serious suggestion from a New York Times columnist in October.) Or Democrats would never send the articles to the Senate, to keep impeachment hanging over Trump's head. Or whatever.
The key Democrats involved aren't saying. But one plausible notion came from Hill columnist A.B. Stoddard, who keeps a close eye on Democrats. Party leaders have their eye on the ongoing investigations into Trump, Stoddard said on Fox News Thursday. What about reports of Russian money going to Ukraine figure Lev Parnas' wife? What are prosecutors in the Southern District of New York doing? Is something big coming? There is, Stoddard said, "a lot of pressure on Democrats to wait this out until there is more to throw at the president."
It's not clear precisely how that would work because the House has already passed two articles of impeachment that make specific accusations against Trump. Beyond that, withholding impeachment indefinitely in hopes that a federal investigation will come up with something big (basically what Democrats did in the Trump-Russia affair) might end in disappointment.
In any event, Pelosi is withholding the articles of impeachment. It is unclear how long she will do it, but it seems they will be withheld at least until Jan. 7, when the House returns for business. That alone will delay a Senate trial significantly. (In the Clinton impeachment, as noted above, the House vote was on Dec. 19, the articles were sent to the Senate the same day, and the trial began Jan. 7.)
In the limbo Pelosi has created, almost anything seems possible. On Saturday, Brit Hume, of Fox News, tweeted that "if House Democrats continue to play this game, I can't see what would prevent McConnell and the Senate Republicans from dismissing the articles of impeachment for lack of prosecution. It would take two-thirds to convict, but only a simple majority to dismiss." That seemed like an entirely sensible option for Senate Republicans, although one certain to draw howls of opposition from Democrats.
During the House impeachment inquiry, Republicans often complained that Democrats did not observe basic rules of fairness. On one hand, Democrats denied the charge, and on the other, they argued that the majority can do what it wants. It's true. Given the constitutional authorities involved, the House Democratic majority could do what it wanted during impeachment. Now, if there ever is a trial, the Senate Republican majority can also do what it wants. And whatever they choose in the end, Pelosi's gamesmanship will likely make the GOP more united.

Resumen: The holidays are expensive, but we've got your back. Here are five phone apps to help you save money on hotels, gas and books this holiday season.

Texto completo: Here’s the thing about the holidays: If you could save some cash, wouldn’t you?
Whether you’re traveling over the winter break or planning a “staycation,” there are several apps that can help keep your hard-earned cash in your pocket.
After all, you probably racked up a couple of credit cards to buy gifts for family and friends, so the last thing you want is to spend more, am I right?
All you need is your trusty smartphone and tablet, and a few good apps, to provide a bit of a financial reprieve this time of year.
Not including shopping apps – as we’ve covered those here and here – be sure to load up your device with these following five freebies.
Save on hotels: Hotel-booking tricks, tips and tools to try if you want to score a deal on your next trip
1. Save on hotels (after you book)
Get a better price on your hotel – after you’ve booked it. This is the simple premise behind Pruvo.
Here’s how it works: Reserve your hotel room however you like – such as Hotels. com, Expedia or Trivago – and then forward to confirmation email to save@pruvo. net. If the hotel drops the rate on the room before your stay, which happens more often than not, you’ll be notified on your phone about how much you’ll save by canceling the original reservation and rebooking at the lower rate.
(And don’t worry, the app walks you through the entire process. )
The only catch is you need to have the ability to cancel your room to begin with.
2. Borrow e-books, audiobooks
Of course, you’re aware you can buy e-books and audiobooks for your smartphone or tablet, but did you know you can also borrow them from your local library? Yes, for free. You don’t need to drive to the library, nor are there late fees to worry about.
So long as you have your library card and the Libby app installed on your device, there are tens of thousands of supported libraries worldwide. On the day it expires, it won’t be accessible on your device – unless you extend the loan period.
And no, it’s not just old classics available, but many of the newer New York Times bestsellers, too. Libby also boasts an impressive built-in e-book reader, graphic novel viewer and audiobook player.
On a related note, also the Internet Archive (archive. org), a nonprofit resource with millions of free books, movies, music, old radio plays and more.
Holiday spending bill: Most of us spend $1,000 or more on gifts, travel and goodies
Be aware: This challenge could delay your holiday packages
3. Trade in your old gadgets
Perhaps you treated yourself to a new smartphone this season or simply want to declutter ahead of 2020.
Whatever the reason, you can get rid of your old tech and earn some cash in the process.
With Gazelle. com, answer a few questions about your “previously enjoyed” device, ship it for free and get money fast. And yes, if you decide to buy something from Gazelle, all products are certified pre-owned, which means they are “like new,” says Gazelle, at a fraction of the cost of retail.
Those who want cash even faster can use Gazelle’s ecoATM app, which shows you where the closest ecoATM kiosks are. It’s a nationwide network of over 4,000 automated kiosks, found in many malls, supermarkets, department stores and other retail spaces. Put in your device, answer some questions on the touchscreen, and the machine will provide instant cash right then and there.
Trade turmoil: With trade war looming, will shoppers spend more this holiday season?
4. Save money on calls, texts
With the free TextNow app for iOS and Android, not only can you make free phone calls and texts, but you also get your own incoming number at no charge.
Make unlimited calls to any 10-digit number in the U. S. and Canada, even on an iPad (or other tablet) or iPod touch, over Wi-Fi. The app will first ask what city you’d like your number to be from, such as Chicago, and will find a local area code for you to use. Some people like having a second number on their existing smartphone – like a “burner phone” – to use for things like online dating, selling items over online classifieds and other instances where you might not want to give our your real phone number.
And if you want to call around the world, TextNow offers low-cost international rates, or you can watch ads or install other apps to earn credits. It’s free because the app has some ads, but there’s an optional in-app purchase ($2. 99) to remove them.
5. Save on gas
If you’re planning a road trip this holiday season, GasBuddy helps sniff out deals on gasoline and diesel in the U. S. and Canada.
Using your phone’s GPS, the app shows you which nearby stations have the lowest prices – for regular, midgrade and premium fuel – and provides maps if you don’t know the area.
View gas stations by distance, price, company or amenities (like car washes, restaurants and washrooms).
It’s optional, but paying with a free GasBuddy card saves 5 cents per gallon on every fill-up, nationwide, plus you’ll get access to special offers and access to giveaway to win free gas.
According to the company, GasBuddy has saved users nearly $3 billion in fuel over the past 15 years.

ASU says Zócalo Public Square leader resigns after investigation

Texto completo: The leader of an events and journalism organization owned by Arizona State University resigned from his job on Friday following allegations of misconduct against his employees that were found credible by an investigation.
Gregory Rodriguez, the founder and publisher of the Los Angeles-based Zócalo Public Square, faced complaints from 10 people who work or worked at the organization. The organization currently has nine full-time employees.
Despite finding the many of the complaints credible, the university had not fired Rodriguez, The Arizona Republic first reported last week.
The university said in a statement on Friday that Rodriguez submitted his resignation to them, and the university accepted.
ASU plans to continue operating Zócalo, the university said. It will announce a new executive director in the "near future," the statement said.
What were the allegations? After receiving complaints from employees, the university started an investigation and placed Rodriguez on paid administrative leave.
ASU's Office of University Rights and Responsibilities conducted the investigation, ultimately concluding that Rodriguez had discriminated against employees based on sex, sexual orientation and disability, all of which are protected classes.
That meant Rodriguez had violated a university policy prohibiting discrimination, harassment and retaliation.
A determination letter from the university laid out the complaints against Rodriguez: physically touching employees, swearing at employees, treating women with children differently, poking fun at perceived disabilities and discriminating against an employee in a same-sex relationship.
At least initially, the violations weren't considered a fireable offense by the university.
Instead, the university said it would be "taking steps to address this behavior," according to a letter from James O'Brien, the senior vice president for university affairs, obtained by The Arizona Republic.
Rodriguez was to be removed from any managerial or supervisory position, O'Brien said in the letter, and all of Zócalo's employees would have to undergo training on workplace policies, conduct and avenues for reporting concerns.
ASU said last week that a final decision about Rodriguez's employment status hadn't yet been made by ASU President Michael Crow.
What the ASU investigation found The university's investigation found that Rodriguez created an "intentionally informal" workplace culture at Zócalo, "where cursing, yelling, and speaking openly about employees' private lives is routine."
But there was "overwhelming evidence" that when he became frustrated or upset at employees, he would act in a way that was "unacceptable for a person in a managerial role," according to a report on the investigation.
Multiple people who complained to investigators said he would repeatedly berate them in person and by text. He would yell at them multiple times per week, they said.
He called them names like "dumbass" and "f--kup," the report said.
The behavior was inappropriate for a manager toward any employee, ASU said. But there were specific instances that targeted employees who were members of protected classes, discriminating against them on the basis of sex, sexual orientation or disability.
His treatment of female employees was "notably worse" than for men, the report said. He "yelled at multiple female employees in a manner that was physically intimidating and made them fearful."
He touched two female employees "in an intimidating manner," which ASU described as "grabbing one employee and shaking another."
Female employees who wanted to get married and/or have children faced disparaging comments. He said the desire to marry and have kids showed they weren't inclined to work hard and weren't able to succeed in the workplace, ASU said.
He didn't make similar comments to male employees about fatherhood.
He also called people gender-based names, like "p---sy" to male employees and "bitch," "biatch" and "little girl" to female employees.
An employee in a same-sex relationship was not allowed to bring her partner to Zócalo's public events, although opposite-sex partners were invited. He told investigators this was because he viewed the partner negatively, not because of her gender.
"The evidence indicated that he had never attempted to apply a 'no partners' policy for employees in opposite sex relationships, even when he felt negatively about the employee's opposite sex partner," the investigation found.
He called an employee he perceived to be disabled "Eeyore" and "mopey" and implied to others that the employee was depressed.
What is Zócalo Public Square? Zócalo Public Square was founded in 2003 as a nonprofit by Rodriguez that aimed to bring people together for conversations on major questions facing society. The organization also publishes "ideas journalism." Recent events focused around themes such as immigration, homelessness and voting.
Its mission is to connect "people to ideas and to each other by examining essential questions in an accessible, broad-minded, and democratic spirit," its website says.
The organization has partnered with major Los Angeles institutions such as the Getty Museum, the Natural History Museum of LA, KCRW Public Radio and the Smithsonian.
Rodriguez had been a longtime columnist for the Los Angeles Times, his now deleted biography on the Zócalo website stated. He also has written in the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, the Economist, Time and the Atlantic, the bio said. He wrote a book about Mexican immigration and race in America, which was published in 2007.
ASU and Zócalo started a formal partnership in 2011, and it is now an ASU "knowledge enterprise."
The organization's annual budget is more than $1 million, ASU said.
ASU plans to move Zócalo into its new building in Los Angeles, which formerly housed the Herald Examiner. It's likely the organization would hold events there that help build ASU's presence and brand in its new location.
The office's distance from ASU led some employees to feel they didn't have a place to turn when there were problems, several former employees told The Republic.
Several of the former employees interviewed by The Republic said Zócalo did not have human resources staff on site, and it wasn't clear how they could file complaints about the leader of the organization. ASU should have recognized the high turnover rate, with some employees leaving just weeks after they started, and looked into it, they said.
In a statement issued Dec. 13, the university said its human resources staff had visited Zócalo in the past year and that employees were able to use the same reporting process for complaints that all ASU employees have.
But, the university acknowledged, the investigation and recent exit interviews made clear that people working at Zócalo still felt "disconnected" from the university's human resources system.
"This is prompting the university to provide additional training and outreach to employees located at Zócalo Public Square," the university said in that statement.

Texto completo: U.S. Sen. Rick Scott is asking NBC to refuse to air the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics.
Scott and U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Missouri, penned a letter to NBC Universal CEO Stephen Burke and NBC Olympics president Gary Zenkel asking they join in demanding the International Olympic Committee strip the Games from China or else not air the two-week event.
Scott and Hawley cited China's human rights abuses against the Muslim Uyghurs and the crackdown on pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong in their letter, first reported by Axios.
"Communist China is one of the great human rights abusers in the world, and it presents a threat to the safety and security of every athlete and tourist who will travel to Beijing," they wrote.
China has set up a surveillance infrastructure "that tracks every person's location and internet activity ... [and] uses millions of cameras, powered by facial recognition technology, to spy on and persecute those who criticize the regime."
In addition, "documents obtained by the New York Times revealed the lengths to which Communist China uses this technology to track and oppress Uyghurs, a Muslim ethnic group in the province in Xianjing. ... And they confirmed, as had previously been reported, that more than a million Uyghurs are in prison and 're-education camps,' simply because of their religion."
NBC Universal, the letter said, "is faced with an important decision. ... By overlooking China's human rights record, you betray your viewers in misleading them about the most important threat facing our values and our way of life. Please pick human rights over profits."
NBC Universal did not return a request for comment
Scott has been outspoken on China during his first year in office, telling CNBC in November, "Communist China wants to control the entire world, including Americans. They're not our partner. They're never going to be our partner under these existing leadership teams."

'Bombshell' blows up myths and facts

Texto completo: "Bombshell" exploded into the awards race last week, leading the Screen Actors Guild Awards nominations with four nods, including best ensemble, actress (Charlize Theron) and supporting actress (Margot Robbie and Nicole Kidman).
The drama goes behind the scenes at Fox News in 2016. It chronicles the efforts of a group of women – including on-the-outs host Gretchen Carlson (Kidman) and star anchor Megyn Kelly – to expose a culture of misogyny, leading to the ouster of Machiavellian CEO Roger Ailes (John Lithgow), who was accused of sexual harassment by more than 20 women.
Fox News spokesperson Caley Cronin declined to comment to USA TODAY beyond confirming that "Bombshell" producers "never reached out to Fox News during any part of the production."
The film was directed by Jay Roach ("Trumbo") and written by Charles Randolph ("The Big Short"), who breaks down what's fact, fiction and somewhere in between.
Is Robbie's character real? Robbie plays an ambitious, wide-eyed staffer named Kayla Pospisil. A lifelong Fox News fanatic and young evangelical ("I see myself as an influencer in the Jesus space," she says), Pospisil soon catches the eye of Ailes, who promises to promote her to on-air talent in exchange for sexual favors.
Although Pospisil is a fictional character, her experiences of harassment are drawn from interviews Randolph and Roach conducted with ex-Fox News staffers (some of whom violated their non-disclosure agreements to speak with filmmakers).
"What happens inside of Roger's office is based on the stories of three women we had access to," Randolph says. The rest is pulled from Randolph's evangelical upbringing.
"Her being ideologically fervent like a dedicated Republican, but a little sexually fluid and utterly morally sincere, that's based more on women in my life."
Is McKinnon's character fictional? The "Saturday Night Live" favorite is a scene-stealer as Pospisil's savvy co-worker Jess Carr, a closeted lesbian and liberal who has complicated feelings about working at a network that preaches against her values and lifestyle.
Carr was "all made up," Randolph says.
"I wanted to show the bystander narrative. Megyn's story is the story of someone who comes to discover she is complicit by virtue of the institutional norms and her ability to manipulate them in the predation of a younger generation of women. Likewise with Kayla: Her willingness to look the other way creates this dynamic, and she realizes at the end that it affects herself."
Did someone poison Kelly? The film begins with an anxious but steely Kelly en route to moderate the first debate of the Republican primary campaign. She accepts coffee offered by her driver, only to fall violently ill before the debate is about to begin. Rattled, she later relays the incident to Ailes, wondering aloud whether it was nerves or if the man tampered with her drink.
The scene is lifted directly from Kelly's 2016 memoir "Settle for More," although the journalist refuted inferences by the New York Times and others that she was poisoned. Yet "Bombshell" leaves the circumstances around her mystery illness intentionally vague.
"Roger said, 'How dare you have a cup of coffee from a guy you don't know. What are you, crazy?'" Randolph says. "Megyn has a good ear for absurdist details."
Did Ailes consult Rudy Giuliani? "Bombshell" is a who's who of famous faces, including Malcolm McDowell as Rupert Murdoch, Allison Janney as Ailes' legal counsel Susan Estrich, and Connie Britton as Ailes' wife, Beth. Then there's Richard Kind, who portrays Ailes' friend Rudy Giuliani. The embattled Ailes asks the politician/attorney how to handle the fallout of his sexual harassment allegations.
"Ailes had three different lawyers who we let Giuliani stand in for," Randolph says. "If you wanted to be a Republican public intellectual, all avenues went through Roger Ailes' office, and that mattered in terms of his ability to prey on young people who had aspirations."
Was Ailes known as 'the legs man'? The film shows a competitive work environment at Fox News for female anchors and producers, many of whom rarely spoke or befriended each other. (Kelly and Carlson, for instance, only share the screen once in passing in an elevator – true to real life, where they worked different shifts and "almost never interacted," Randolph says.)
"Bombshell" also illustrates Ailes' predatory behavior: asking women to spin in front of him during meetings, and demanding that on-air talent wear short skirts to show off their legs. Such scenes were drawn from Kelly's book, as well as Gabriel Sherman's 2014 Ailes biography, "The Loudest Voice in the Room," and Sarah Ellison's 2016 expose for Vanity Fair, Randolph says.
"All the women who filed complaints about him who have gone public have been really brave in articulating ... what happened to them," Randolph says.
The film's most chilling scene is a private meeting between Ailes and Pospisil when he pressures her to lift her skirt. The camera lingers on Pospisil, near tears, as he orders her to inch it higher and higher, revealing her underwear. By letting the abuse play out in real time, Randolph hopes male viewers, in particular, will feel uncomfortable but also feel greater empathy for victims.
"When you're in the room and you appreciate the intonations and context of it, you can see how it could be utterly life-changing and maddening and complicated for a young woman,'" he says.
Kayla (Margot Robbie, left) and Jess (Kate McKinnon) are Fox friends and confidantes in "Bombshell."

Texto completo: Of the two biggest news stories this year, only one of them is truly a scandal, and it’s not the one that's led to the ridiculously partisan impeachment.
No, the big scandal is that our most important and powerful law enforcement agency, the FBI, engaged in an unwarranted spy operation against a major party's presidential campaign. That story is only just now being told, thanks to U.S. Attorney General William Barr having called for multiple investigations into the matter.
It’s a scandal of epic proportions, and yet New York Times columnist Bret Stephens, who insists he’s a conservative living in the real world, thinks it’s only on the same scale as an impeachment by Democrats over a phone call.
“If conservatives are right to object to the abuse of power by F.B.I. agents,” wrote Stephens on Wednesday, “shouldn’t they be far more alarmed at the abuse of investigatory and other powers for political ends by the president of the United States?”
Well, yes, that would be the case if Trump had abused his “investigatory and other powers for political ends.” But that’s not what he did. Whether Trump abused the power of his office is at best debatable. But at minimum, we know that high-level FBI agents, elected to nothing, abused their own power for what looks like the purpose of taking down a presidential candidate they didn’t like. That fact isn’t up for debate. The inspector general said it, and so did the head judge of the FISA court, which the FBI relies on for surveillance warrants.
True, Trump potentially stood to benefit from any investigation Ukraine might pursue into Joe Biden and its own meddling in the 2016 election. (A Ukrainian government agency in 2016 mysteriously uncovered the evidence that Paul Manafort, who then served as Trump’s campaign manager in 2016, was tied to an off-the-books Russian money scheme — all by coincidence, I’m sure.)
Only one of these things is a scandal. There is no case for real conservatives to treat impeachment and the FBI’s malfeasance as equivalent.

Texto completo: A phrase I kept jotting in my notebook during a "Bombshell" screening, "So many great women!" could apply to the star-studded cast or to the real folks who have stepped forward in the #MeToo era to insist that their voices be heard.
Three key women in "Bombshell" are among those voices: Fox News hosts Megyn Kelly (Charlize Theron), Gretchen Carlson (Nicole Kidman) and a composite character called Kayla (Margot Robbie). One of the most potent, even suspenseful, scenes in the fact-based movie features them entering an elevator one by one and eyeing each other, as if working up the nerve to speak. All three are being abused by Fox honcho Roger Ailes and, at that point in the movie, they're unsure what -- if anything -- to do about it, especially since none is sure if she's the only one. Knowing what we know now, we wish they'd say something to each other even though we're pretty sure they won't.
The abuse depicted is shocking, but "Bombshell" is surprisingly entertaining. And a com
edy. The screenplay by "Big Short" Oscar winner Charles Randolph is jam-packed with zingers such as a Fox employee (Kate McKinnon) explaining to a newbie (Robbie) as they walk through their office: "Ask yourself what would scare your grandmother or piss off your grandfather. That's a Fox story."
Theron's brittle intelligence suits Kelly, who is depicted as so career-focused that she hesitated to do anything about Ailes. Her hesitation is called out when Kayla and Megyn finally do speak and when Kelly asks a female underling if she knows of anyone who has been harassed and the underling shoots back, "Is this one where you really want to know or one where you want to look like you want to know but you don't?"
Kidman captures Minnesota native Carlson's calm decency as she leads the charge and waits for others to join her. Robbie is the most moving as a woman whose ideals vanish in front of our eyes (and in front of Ailes', as he demands to see her panties). McKinnon is not only hilarious but also poignant in a regretful scene in which, sensing co-worker Robbie is about to share a story of abuse, she asks her not to.
In many ways, "Bombshell" is a depiction of a whisper network so quiet it can't benefit anyone. For a variety of reasons, all the women we meet are afraid to talk about what happened to them. As a result, much of the abuse remains a secret even at the end of the movie, a secret that director Jay Roach smartly reminds us of by capturing pointed looks from Brooke Smith as a public relations exec with an impossible job, Allison Janney as Ailes' brassy lawyer, Holland Taylor as his mysterious assistant, Connie Britton as his deluded wife and Alanna Ubach as the even-more-deluded Jeanine Pirro. Those looks linger long after the movie is over and, in fact, I'm still trying to puzzle out Taylor's meaningful glances as she buzzes Robbie into Ailes' office.
The only thing "Bombshell" has more of than great women is iffy prosthetics. Theron looks just fine but John Lithgow as Ailes appears to have reused his Winston Churchill jowls and gut from "The Crown" and slathered more on top of that, and the guy who plays Bill O'Reilly is so encased in rubber body parts that he resembles a Muppet.
Luckily, those dudes aren't onscreen much. This movie belongs to the women and, like the book from New York Times reporters who wrote "She Said" about women coming forward with accounts of abuse, it's both a spellbinding effort to get to the bottom of a mystery and an inspiring call to arms.

THE FORCE IS (STILL) WITH US

Texto completo: Valley News Staff Writer
It makes me feel old and yet strangely young to say this, but I saw the first Star Wars in the theater. It’s hard to imagine now, but it was a sensation.
It came out in May 1977 and ended up staying in some theaters for more than a year. I can’t recall whether I saw it early in its run, or later on, but I do remember that the theater was packed, the audience jubilant. At the time, it was like nothing else ever put on film.
With The Rise of Skywalker, the final film, the ninth in a trilogy of trilogies, opening in theaters Friday, and with a tween boy in my household, Star Wars and what it has wrought are on my mind. Objectively speaking, these are not great movies, and yet they have built up a cultural gravity that seems as inescapable as a black hole. How is it that the film I saw when I was 6 or 7 was the beginning of a story that’s still being told?
It’s hard to overstate how much Star Wars and its immediate successors changed cinema. As the first film in the space Western genre (although an argument could be made for Star Trek, Flash Gordon and Buck Rogers as the first voyagers to that ultimate frontier), Star Wars birthed a new and all-American type of storytelling. It had all of the American optimism, which was a tonic in the post-Watergate, post-Vietnam malaise era. That it was goofy, not particularly well written and kind of schlocky was over-ridden by the film’s energy, verve and special effects, which were amazing on the big screen.
Star Wars and its successors were meant to be watched with child-like wonder. There’s a reason George Lucas started that first film with “A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away …,” and every installment starts the same way, to divorce us from our earth-bound critical faculties. Think a little about the films and they all come crashing down, though I think the current trilogy functions better as a narrative than the previous ones.
My son wanted to watch Return of the Jedi recently, and I couldn’t ignore just how cringe-inducing the cute little Ewoks are, an animist native population stumbled upon by our white heroes. The effort to make the current films more representative, with the young female Jedi Rey and the former stormtrooper Finn, who is black, among other diverse characters, led to a petty, ugly backlash on the internet, that deep well from which all petty backlashes now spring.
And how is it that the fearsome Empire manages to bungle its every advantage? During the “global war on terror,” do the films read differently? As the old saying goes, one man’s freedom fighter is another man’s terrorist. Even as a child, I wasn’t sure the destruction of the Death Star and all the people on it was something to celebrate, but this was a war we were supposed to be happy about.
An argument could be, and probably has been made that Star Wars gave rise to our shallow culture of movie blockbusters, currently embodied most fully by the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Those films, particularly the last two Avengers films, Infinity War and Endgame, were sprawling and preposterous, over-burdened with unearned seriousness, full of lame posturing and juvenile wordplay. These films are totalizing, if not totalitarian, in their unspoken belief that it’s fine to wield vast power so long as you’re on the side of the angels, forgetting the old maxim that power corrupts, and that absolute power corrupts absolutely.
For films that resist critical interpretation, the Star Wars saga has produced some excellent reviews, and by excellent I don’t mean “positive” but smartly written.
The New Yorker’s film critic, Pauline Kael, started her brief September 1977 review of Star Wars thus: “The loudness, the smash-and-grab editing, the relentless pacing drive every idea from your head; for young audiences Star Wars is like getting a box of Cracker Jack which is all prizes. This is the writer-director George Lucas’s own film, subject to no business interference, yet it’s a film that’s totally uninterested in anything that doesn’t connect with the mass audience. There’s no breather in the picture, no lyricism; the only attempt at beauty is in the double sunset. It’s enjoyable on its own terms, but it’s exhausting, too: like taking a pack of kids to the circus.”
And A.O. Scott’s review of The Rise of Skywalker for The New York Times is a master class: “The struggle of good against evil feels less like a cosmic battle than a longstanding sports rivalry between teams whose glory days are receding. The head coaches come and go, the uniforms are redesigned, certain key players are the subjects of trade rumors, and the fans keep showing up.”
I can’t really argue with that, but viewers of Scott’s age, and mine, who grew up with Star Wars, each have our own relationships with this long story. What I love most about the films are the world-building scenes. The droids marooned on Tatooine, and Ben Kenobi saying, “Mos Eisley. You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy.” And the workings of the Force and other details that make this movie universe what it is.
The beginning of The Force Awakens struck me as a beautiful piece of filmmaking, in which every detail counts. The dialogue is so sharp and the visual cues, such as the bloody handprint on the helmet of stormtrooper FN2187, soon to become Finn, convey meaning with an almost effortless grace. The introduction of Rey as a spirited, nameless young woman eking out a living among scavengers on a desert planet is a brief but glorious portrait of a life circumscribed yet still full of color and hope.
It’s fair to wonder, as I often do in watching these films, how do these characters find one another in the vast galaxy they inhabit? I suppose it’s the Force, which becomes a metaphor not for faith but for storytelling, for truth over falsehood and for the power of stories to forge connections.
What’s most surprising to me as I watch the films now is how much they resemble modern American life, albeit on a galactic scale. Traveling through hyperspace ain’t like dustin’ crops, in the immortal words of Han Solo, but it isn’t unlike getting on a plane in Boston and getting out again only hours later in Sydney or Hong Kong, voyages that until relatively recently would have taken weeks of perilous sailing. Even interstate driving is like interstellar travel in our human scale. The difference between Luke Skywalker’s land speeder and a Toyota Land Cruiser isn’t an apples and oranges kind of thing. Who hasn’t thought of the jump to hyperspace while driving on a snowy night?
Above, I called The Rise of Skywalker the “final” Star Wars film, but that notion is as laughable as calling Return of the Jedi the final Star Wars film would have been in 1983. There’s too much money on the table to stop making these movies now.
Not that I’m complaining. I’m not going to see the movie the night it opens, or even in the first week, but there will be a new episode of The Mandalorian, a spinoff set just after the fall of the empire, on Disney Plus.
I could sign off with “May the Force be with us,” but it looks like it will be whether we want it to or not.

Texto completo: Long after their days in workshops and graduate seminars have ended, some authors still find support and inspiration in writing groups.
Jenny Zhang was in sweatpants, wrestling one Sunday afternoon with a short story that wasn't coming together. She typed out an email to seven other writers: "Yo. Can we meet up next week? I have something that I kinda semi-urently" -- the g key on her keyboard was broken -- "need help on."
The story, which jumped back and forth between plotlines, was intentionally nontraditional, and she didn't want to lose that. The peers whose advice she sought, she said, "would let the jagged edges remain" while making the story "better than it was." When she met with them, they helped her find the thread in the story, which she finished and included in her 2017 book "Sour Heart."
Writing is often considered a solitary act, but some writers have figured out a way to make the process more collaborative even before editors, agents and other publishing professionals get involved. Zhang's group, which includes Alice Sola Kim, Karan Mahajan and Tony Tulathimutte, has been meeting about every month since most of them were undergraduate students at Stanford University. Their sessions are highly structured, with deadlines for submitting drafts and detailed manuscript notes, while other groups gather more informally to talk about their careers, commiserate over deadlines or gossip about the publishing industry.
"You will feel like writing is very lonely and very difficult and very frustrating and that you don't really know what you're doing," said the Chicago-based writer Mikki Kendall. But in a writing group, "you can talk to other people in that place and that are feeling their way out."
For Zhang, the group grew out of a need for a more supportive space than the ones she was encountering in creative-writing classes.
"There would be, like, racist stories being put up and praised in workshops," she said. "I didn't have adults or published writers to look up to, so it was nice to have this horizontal space." Over the years, aside from editing one another's work, they've also turned to each other for advice on choosing an agent or applying to writing residencies.
That these groups are self-selecting means they can be modeled after their members' specific needs. Last year, David Greenberg, who teaches history and media at Rutgers University, was on sabbatical working on a biography of Representative John Lewis when he decided to form a writing group to keep him accountable. He emailed about a dozen academics and journalists who specialized in history, and most of them were game.
"We have a certain degree of expertise and knowledge about both content and approach that makes it a particularly informed, high-level discussion," Greenberg said. Critiquing a chapter of a forthcoming Judah Benjamin biography by James Traub, another member of the group, "We got in a big discussion about slavery and Benjamin's slave-owning, and it led someone to encourage him to draw a more detailed portrait of slavery in New Orleans, where Benjamin lived." One of the members also recommended a recent academic book that helped Traub's research on the topic.
Mira Jacob's critically acclaimed graphic memoir "Good Talk," which reflects on her life through the lens of race, sexuality and identity, came about partly through challenging discussions with her writing group. She left an earlier one, she said, after a member dismissed an early draft of her book as an example of what "was ruining America."
Her new group, which includes the novelists Alexander Chee and Julia Phillips, is made up mostly of people of color, and Jacob said their conversations resulted "in my most vibrant book." "Good Talk" closes with an open letter to Jacob's young son, whose questions about race and politics frame the book. At first, Jacob said, the writing was made more difficult by her anger at having to write it, but the group pushed her to go deeper: Who was the anger directed toward? What did it mean to be angry in a letter to her son? What exactly was she trying to convey?
"I know I was really raw when we talked about it. I know I was kind of terrified. But I know also I never would've even gotten to that place with the other group because the only thing I would've been doing the whole time is saying, 'No this is real,"' she said. "Writing for the voice that demands complexity of you and nuance of you, that makes you a better writer."
Other groups get into everything but writing. The one that Ingrid Rojas Contreras, author of the novel "Fruit of the Drunken Tree," belongs to doesn't exchange work at all, instead focusing on providing mutual support and resources. Members take turns hosting each other in their Bay Area homes, cooking, drinking wine and sometimes using tarot cards for fun to answer career questions.
"I was interested in having community," Rojas Contreras said. "Sometimes when you're exchanging writing, that can be all that it becomes."
But for Zhang and the other members of her group, there is value in developing long-term relationships with each others' work, and it has helped them analyze how their writing is evolving over time. "It's just a really deep and rich context," Zhang said.
In October, they gathered in Tulathimutte's Brooklyn living room, spreading takeout containers and open bottles of Brooklyn Lager and La Croix, to discuss one of Zhang's new stories. The critique was frank ("I felt all over the place in the first few pages," one member, Anna North, said) but meant to be helpful, not snarky. Tulathimutte noted that a side character was being used as a plot device, and in one case, the group went back and forth discussing just one line.
That session was the first time Zhang had felt comfortable submitting something that still contained some typos and redundancies -- but that she knew would benefit from feedback from people she trusted, she said. "I was like, 'It's O.K. with these guys."'

Texto completo: LOS ANGELES — It's the sixth and final Democratic primary debate of the year.
Seven 2020 Democratic presidential candidates will debate at Los Angeles’s Loyola Marymount University on Thursday, the most intimate and least diverse meeting of White House contenders since they began convening over the summer.

Down from 10 candidates who gathered in Atlanta last month, the PBS Newshour and Politico debate will feature leading hopefuls former Vice President Joe Biden, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg from center stage. Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, billionaire hedge fund manager and Democratic megadonor Tom Steyer, and entrepreneur and nonprofit organization executive Andrew Yang will flank them from the outer podiums.

Yang, 44, is the sole minority candidate who qualified to debate in the delegate- and donor-rich “Super Tuesday” state of California. The state’s junior senator, Kamala Harris, dropped out of the race this month, while New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, and former housing secretary Julian Castro failed to meet the polling and fundraising criteria by Dec. 12.

More than six million people tuned in to see November’s debate in Atlanta. Here are seven trends or moments to watch for during Thursday’s three-hour format, which starts at 8 p.m. ET:

Fireworks between Buttigieg and Warren

The smaller debate field means candidates will have more time to sell themselves — and undermine each other. Buttigieg, 37, and Warren, 70, are competing for the same pool of professional-class voters while trying to expand their appeal among black Americans and other minorities. The pair of ascendant contenders will likely escalate their war of words over transparency. They've been at loggerheads on the campaign trail in recent weeks, pummeling each other regarding their corporate work histories.
Buttigieg, an openly gay Afghanistan veteran, was a McKinsey & Company management consultant for three years after he graduated from Harvard College and was a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford. He once advised a major healthcare insurer in Michigan on how to reduce its overhead costs.
Warren, a former Harvard Law School professor, had a range of private legal clients as she taught across the country, including large corporations that pitted her against their middle-class employees. The Consumer and Financial Protection Bureau champion has also swung at Buttigieg over his hesitancy to release the name of his fundraising bundlers.

Tensions between Biden, Buttigieg, and Warren

National polling for Biden, 77, indicates he’s on steadier ground, solidifying his status as the contest’s front-runner after a shaky start to his third presidential campaign. But he’s not in the clear just yet, particularly with surveys showing he’s still behind in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Biden and Buttigieg, two center-left candidates, have ramped up their attacks on Warren, a more liberal contender who hasn’t been shy about hitting back over their ideological differences. While Sanders, 78, has largely been ignored by his rivals occupying the top-tier, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, 59, is another center-left hopeful who’ll likely take a dig at Warren. The former prosecutor is enjoying a late surge ahead of Iowa’s opening caucuses on Feb. 3.
Sharp elbows between Biden and Buttigieg
Although four decades separate Biden and Buttigieg, the opponents are trying to woo the same moderately center-left voters turned off by Warren and Sanders’s more liberal brand of politics. In a way, they’re also both vying for the right to carry on former President Barack Obama’s legacy, with Biden as his two-term No. 2 and Buttigieg evoking the memory of the party elder as “another young man with the funny name” during iterations of his stump speech. The former Rhodes scholar needs to tread lightly though. Other candidates who have gone after Biden, such as Harris, 55, and Castro, 45, have come up on the losing end.
A wedge between Warren and Sanders?
Although Sanders hasn’t been afraid to point out his liberal ally Warren is still a capitalist, the former teacher has been reluctant to draw distinctions between herself and the socialist. As Warren’s campaign loses steam after a summer of momentum, watch for her to be prodded on what distinguishes her from the former representative for Vermont in the House, whose “Medicare for all” platform she embraced to her detriment. She’s unlikely to take the bait though in case she can scoop up some of his supporters in what’s looking more and more like a tight race for the nomination.
The shadow of Michael Bloomberg
The late entry of Michael Bloomberg, 77, into the primary in November sent ripples through the field. The Biden camp, in particular, is nervous given the former Republican and independent New York City mayor chalked up his decision to enter the fray to Biden’s poor performance. Although the billionaire businessman and philanthropist, who’s already spent in excess of $100 million on his campaign, has notched up an average of 5% support in national polls, his choice to self-fund his bid meant he couldn’t be considered for Thursday’s debate. Any salvos lobbed at Bloomberg may also be directed at Tom Steyer, 62, the other megawealthy candidate hoping to become the party’s standard-bearer. Sanders and Warren have been especially vocal about their distaste for the duo.
Impeachment
The issue of impeachment is sure to be raised after the House introduced two articles of impeachment against President Trump, 73. The first article covers abuse of power and the second obstruction of Congress, each stemming from allegations Trump improperly leveraged U.S. military aid to pressure Ukraine to investigate Biden. The House’s timeline sets up a likely January trial in the Senate, impinging on many of the Senate candidates’ plans to make a final push with voters before Iowa. As an aside, the topic of trade may also be broached after the Trump administration and congressional Democrats finally reached an agreement regarding the U.S.-Mexico-Canada deal.
Boasts about solving Loyola Marymount University’s labor dispute
Thursday’s debate was at risk of not happening at Loyola Marymount University after a labor dispute boiled over between the food workers' union, Unite Here Local 11, and subcontracted on-campus food service provider Sodexo. Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez, a former Obama administration labor secretary, stepped in to help broker a deal after the seven candidates, as well as Booker and Castro, pledged to boycott the event rather than cross the union’s picket line. The debate was supposed to be at the University of California Los Angeles, but was shifted to Loyola Marymount because of a separate labor disagreement.
The next debates will be hosted by the early-voting states of Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina, staggered to take place on Jan. 14, Feb. 7, Feb. 19, and Feb. 25, just before each respective nominating contest.

CIA opposed expelling Chinese diplomats who breached US military base: Report

Texto completo: The CIA argued against expelling two Chinese diplomats who were suspected of spying in the United States.
During interagency discussions on how to respond to the breach at a sensitive military base in Norfolk, Virginia, the CIA argued the expulsions could prompt Beijing’s intelligence services to change how they operate, a U.S. official told the Washington Times. Ultimately, it was the State Department's decision.
The agency was concerned that sending the officials home would lead Chinese intelligence agencies to adopt spying measures that are harder to counter.
The CIA declined the Washington Examiner's request for comment.
American officials suspect at least one of the Chinese officials was an intelligence officer operating under diplomatic cover.
The U.S. government quietly expelled the diplomats this fall after they drove onto the base near Norfolk in September and only stopped when fire trucks blocked their path, the New York Times reported. The officials were accompanied by their wives when they were told to turn around and exit the base by a guard. They claimed to have not understood the guard’s instructions.
The Chinese government denounced the expulsions on Tuesday.
“The U.S. accusation on our officials is completely inconsistent with the truth. We made stern representations and protests to the U.S. side. We urge the U.S. to correct its mistake, withdraw this decision and protect Chinese diplomats' legitimate rights and interests according to the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations,” said Geng Shuang, a Foreign Ministry spokesman, making it the first official acknowledgment by either side of the expulsions.
American officials have increasingly warned about China’s threat to national security.
The expulsions appear to be the first of Chinese diplomats suspected of spying in more than three decades. In 1987, the U.S. apprehended two Chinese diplomats who had tried to obtain classified National Security Agency documents.

Sólo 7 candidatos en el último debate demócrata del año en Los Ángeles

Texto completo: Solo siete de los 15 precandidatos demócratas participarán esta noche en el sexto y último debate de 2019, que se celebrará un día después de que Congreso aprobara la noche del miércoles el juicio político en contra del presidente Donald Trump.
En el encuentro, que se llevará a cabo en la Universidad de Loyola Marymount en Los Ángeles, se enfrentarán nuevamente los tres precandidatos que lideran las encuestas: el exvicepresidente Joe Biden encabeza las preferencias con un 28%, seguido por el senador Bernie Sanders (19%) y por la senadora Elizabeth Warren (14,8%), según el compilado de encuestas RealClearPolitics (RCP).
Se espera Warren protagonice una de la confrontaciones de la jornada junto a Pete Buttigieg, quien aparece en el cuarto lugar (8,2%) de las encuestas. La senadora y el alcalde de South Bend han incrementado el intercambio de ataques, especialmente en temas relacionados con transparencia, como los orígenes de sus fondos de campaña o la información sobre devoluciones de los impuestos, según detalla The New York Times.
En el debate participarán también Andrew Yang, exejecutivo de la industria de la Tecnología; Amy Klobuchar, senadora demócrata por Minnesota, y Tom Steyer, multimillonario y activista por el cambio climático.
Biden llega fortalecido
Biden, de 77 años, ocupará por primera vez en los debates de este año, la posición central en el escenario. El exvicepresidente llega a la cita fortalecido por el apoyo recibido de John Kerry, que fue jefe de la diplomacia en el segundo mandato de Barack Obama, pero como en cada debate surgen los miedos por su propensión a salirse del libreto y sus lapsus.
A principios de diciembre, Biden se exasperó con un votante que cuestionó el rol de su hijo en la compañía de energía ucraniana Burisma, que está en el centro del escándalo que desató el proceso de juicio político contra Trump. El compañero de fórmula de Obama en sus dos mandatos le respondió aireado descalificándolo como un “maldito mentiroso” y además lo llamó “gordo”.
Para hacer frente a las críticas, Biden publicó el martes un parte médico sobre su salud.
El principal capital de Biden es su experiencia y su promesa de que si es electo el país va a volver a la normalidad, dejando atrás la polarización de la era Trump. Con estas credenciales, Biden se ha labrado el preciado apoyo de los obreros y de las comunidades negras.
Además, ha prometido ha prometido abrir un camino a la ciudadanía a todos los inmigrantes indocumentados actualmente en el país, entregando una serie de propuestas para sus primeros 100 días de gobierno, para, según dijo, revertir la “dañina” política migratoria de Trump.
El debate se desarrollará bajo la sombra de Bloomberg, que pese a su avance en las encuestas no logró clasificarse ya que no tiene el mínimo de 200,000 donantes individuales. El millonario, que financia su propia campaña, sabe que llegó tarde a la contienda por lo que se concentrará en los estados que votarán a partir de marzo, entre ellos Texas y California.
El camino a la nominación
Tras el debate, solo faltarán 46 días para que empiecen, en Iowa, las votaciones para las primarias, en un largo camino que terminará a mediados de año con la Convención del Partido Demócrata y la definición del candidato que participará en las elecciones de noviembre de 2020.
En este proceso, en el que a medida que van votando los estados los distintos candidatos van sumando delegados, son muy importantes los resultados en los primeros en votar. En Iowa, Buttigieg – que está rezagado a nivel nacional – lleva la delantera con 22,5%, seguido de Sanders con 19,3% y de Biden con 18%.
En el siguiente estado en votar, New Hampshire, la tendencia se invierte y Sanders es el favorito con 19%, seguido por Buttigieg con 17,7% y de Biden con 14%.

Además, ha prometido ha prometido abrir un camino a la ciudadanía a todos los inmigrantes indocumentados actualmente en el país, entregando una serie de propuestas para sus primeros 100 días de gobierno, para, según dijo, revertir la “dañina” política migratoria de Trump.
El debate se desarrollará bajo la sombra de Bloomberg, que pese a su avance en las encuestas no logró clasificarse ya que no tiene el mínimo de 200,000 donantes individuales. El millonario, que financia su propia campaña, sabe que llegó tarde a la contienda por lo que se concentrará en los estados que votarán a partir de marzo, entre ellos Texas y California.
El camino a la nominación
Tras el debate, solo faltarán 46 días para que empiecen, en Iowa, las votaciones para las primarias, en un largo camino que terminará a mediados de año con la Convención del Partido Demócrata y la definición del candidato que participará en las elecciones de noviembre de 2020.
En este proceso, en el que a medida que van votando los estados los distintos candidatos van sumando delegados, son muy importantes los resultados en los primeros en votar. En Iowa, Buttigieg – que está rezagado a nivel nacional – lleva la delantera con 22,5%, seguido de Sanders con 19,3% y de Biden con 18%.
En el siguiente estado en votar, New Hampshire, la tendencia se invierte y Sanders es el favorito con 19%, seguido por Buttigieg con 17,7% y de Biden con 14%.

Texto completo: The candidates must know the quirks of California's vast political geography.
LOS ANGELES -- Welcome, Democrats and debate spinners, to the city with a Mexican-American-Jewish-Italian Rhodes Scholar mayor, who is not running for president, in the state with an Irish Catholic governor who surely is, just not this time.
The landmarks are no doubt familiar -- the Hollywood sign, the Santa Monica pier, the Griffith Observatory memorialized in "Rebel Without a Cause," a movie released more than a quarter century before Pete Buttigieg was born.
Young and old can at least agree that, by any measure, California is big -- hence its 495 presidential delegates, so coveted, yet so costly to woo. Los Angeles County is more populous than 41 states. Neighboring San Bernardino is the largest county in the contiguous United States, and about the size of West Virginia. California has more of everything: Democrats, immigrants, billionaires, homeless, traffic and natural disasters.
But there are nuances of political geography that may not have been covered in the prep for the Democratic debate here on Thursday night.
The outsize clout of labor in Los Angeles, for example, was underscored by the difficulty in finding a place to hold the debate that would not require candidates to cross a picket line. The Los Angeles County Federation of Labor, an umbrella group of several hundred unions representing more than 800,000 workers, has been central to national organizing campaigns like Justice for Janitors and the Fight for 15. Building power from its largely immigrant membership, the "county fed" has also been a political springboard, particularly for Latino leaders in state government.
The rise of labor in Los Angeles is relatively recent. Until quite late in the 20th century, Los Angeles was a virulently anti-union town. San Francisco was the heart of the state's labor movement, ever since the longshoremen's union led the 1934 general strike that shut down the city for four days.
The Bay Area was long the locus of Democratic influence and money in the decades when California was staunchly Republican. (The state's deep blue status is also recent: Gov. Gavin Newsom, whose presidential aspirations are a popular topic in Sacramento, is only the fifth Democrat elected to lead the state in modern times.) By the 1960s, rapid growth began to shift power south, hastened by court decisions that forced the allocation of State Senate seats by population rather than by county. But Northern California, the Bay Area in particular, has remained a Democratic power base. The party's past two governors, four United States senators and four attorneys general -- not to mention House Speaker Nancy Pelosi -- all have roots there.
In part, that's because Bay Area voters consistently turn out in higher percentages, which is just another reason they feel smug. On the whole, Northerners look down on Southerners -- though not of course to the degree that East Coasters do -- while Southerners tend to ignore the rivalry. The different cultures, history and topography divided by the Tehachapi Mountains have confused political outsiders going back to the 1960s, when the Kennedys could never understand why they needed separate campaign operations for north and south California.
Another split, exacerbated in recent years, has been between the (reliably blue) coastal areas and the (more red though leaning purple) inland areas, particularly the huge Central Valley, which the former bodybuilder governor Arnold Schwarzenegger recently called "the abs of California." By many measures, it is a core that needs strengthening. The valley is not home to the wealth of the coastal areas, and yet income inequality is most severe there because the poorest are so poor.
California is a state of extremes. Angelenos like to boast that in normal weather, if such a thing ever returns, you can ski in the morning in the mountains east of the city and swim in the ocean in the afternoon. The political equivalent may be the jarring juxtaposition of Representatives Adam Schiff and Devin Nunes. Only two congressional districts separate their respective seats.
Mr. Nunes is from Tulare, one of the leading agricultural counties in the country, where his family once owned a dairy farm. Now he is suing a cow on twitter. The popularity of the parody cow account has prompted people to don cow suits outside the congressman's events, which has cramped his style but not diminished his fund-raising. One of only seven Republicans left in the state's 53-member delegation, he reported $ 7 million cash on hand in the most recent cycle, the most of any House member.
Money is a perquisite for running in California, but no guarantee. If Michael Bloomberg had qualified for the debate, he could have spoken to both those points: The last time he campaigned in California was for Republican Meg Whitman, who broke national records by spending $ 144 million of her personal fortune. She lost the 2010 governor's race to Jerry Brown.
Now Mr. Bloomberg is spending his personal fortune to compete for Democratic votes. And there are more of them than ever. Registration has peaked at 80 percent of eligible voters, the highest it has been at a comparable point this century. Democrats have maintained a steady 44 percent of the total, while the number of voters choosing not to register in any party has for the first time surpassed the number of Republicans. Those independents can vote in the Democratic primary, too.
Anti-Trump sentiment is credited for the surge in voter registration, especially among the young. But the president did bring one silver lining for Los Angeles -- an end to the frequent "Obama jams" that snarled traffic.
How to get people out of cars, particularly in Los Angeles, has become an increasingly important focus. The city's mayor, Eric Garcetti, recently started a competition to redesign streetlights, partly as an aesthetic exercise, partly in an effort to redirect light to illuminate sidewalks. The project also aims to redress inequities in the city between rich and poor neighborhoods. Before you make jokes about the weather, consider that climate and the natural world underlie almost every facet of life in California, shaping not only lifestyles but also the economy.
That formidable economy, the world's fifth largest, has thrived, despite the state's penchant for regulations. As of January, solar panels will be required on new homes. California has banned foie gras, the sale of fur coats, small shampoo bottles in hotels and smoking at state parks and beaches. ("If people can't smoke even on a deserted beach, where can they? There must be some limit to the coercive power of government," Mr. Brown wrote in a 2017 veto message. Mr. Newsom signed the bill this year.) In January, the sale of alligator skin boots will become illegal -- a move Louisiana officials charge will decimate the multimillion dollar industry that relies on the Golden State for 30 percent of its business.
California does, however, make some things easier. While other states are purging voter rolls, California has gone the other direction. More than 65 percent of ballots cast in November 2018 were mailed in. This year, for the first time, ballots came with postage prepaid envelopes. Ballots postmarked Election Day are accepted up to three days later. Next year, the state will expand same-day registration, so voters can more easily cast provisional ballots at the polls.
All that means, don't count on knowing the results of the primary on election night. The general election, though, is probably a safer bet.

Texto completo: "Blue Collar Comedy Tour" alum Ron White is coming to Hershey Theatre on Thursday, March 26, 2020.
White's show starts at 8 p.m., and tickets go on sale Friday, Dec. 20 at 10 a.m. Tickets will be available at the Hershey Theatre Box Office or online at hersheyentertainment.com and ticketmaster.com.
One of White's most famous bits is about being arrested, and when asked if he had any aliases, he gave a smart aleck response: "They call me... Tater Salad." The bit continues with an arrest 17 years later, in which White tells the police officer "You caught me! You caught the Tater."
White's often seen on stage with a scotch and cigar in hand. A press release for his upcoming tour notes he'll have a different drink in hand this time: tequila, since he purchased the company Number Juan Tequila.
White's achievements include two Grammy nominations, a feature in Cameron Crowe's showtime series "Roadies," and writing the New York Times Best Selling book "I Had the Right to Remain Silent... But I Didn't Have the Ability."
Hershey Theatre is located at 15 E. Caracas Ave. in Hershey. For more information, visit hersheyentertainment.com.

Texto completo: His "Paco's Story" was the surprise winner of the National Book Award for fiction in 1987, beating books by Toni Morrison and Philip Roth.
Larry Heinemann, a Vietnam veteran who drew on his war experiences in two well-received novels -- one of which, "Paco's Story," startled the literary world when it won the National Book Award for fiction in 1987 -- died on Dec. 11 in Bryan, Texas. He was 75.
His daughter, Sarah Heinemann, said the cause was chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
"Paco's Story," published in 1986, was an unexpected winner not only because Mr. Heinemann was not well known -- he had published only one previous novel -- but also because of the daunting competition it beat out. Other nominees that year included "Beloved," by Toni Morrison (which won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction a few months later), and "The Counterlife," by Philip Roth (which won the National Book Critics Circle Award for fiction). It had been widely expected that one of them would win the National Book Award.
"When Mr. Heinemann's name was announced," an account of the awards ceremony in The New York Times said, "a brief silence gripped the ballroom, followed by uncertain applause."
Among those surprised was Mr. Heinemann himself, who had traveled from Chicago for the awards ceremony at the Pierre Hotel in Manhattan.
"I didn't come here expecting to win," he said after the announcement. "I came here for the party."
The selection of "Paco's Story," about the war and its aftermath for the lone survivor of a battle, set off hand-wringing in the literary world.
A week after the award presentation, Michiko Kakutani, chief book critic of The Times, wrote an essay pointing out what she thought were the weaknesses of "Paco's Story" and all but saying that "Beloved" should have won. Two months later (but before Ms. Morrison and "Beloved" had been awarded the Pulitzer), 48 black writers and critics published a statement deploring the fact that Ms. Morrison, an African-American and by then one of the country's leading writers, had never won a National Book Award or a Pulitzer Prize.
Some theorized that in picking Mr. Heinemann's book, the three-judge panel was seeking to reaffirm the award's reputation for recognizing out-of-the-mainstream talent. Certainly one of the remarkable things about Mr. Heinemann and his writing was that his was a voice not often found in refined literary circles.
"Larry Heinemann came from and wrote for and about the working class in this country -- a class woefully underrepresented in our literary fiction," Gerald Howard, an executive editor at Doubleday who edited and published "Black Virgin Mountain: A Return to Vietnam," Mr. Heinemann's 2005 memoir, said by email. "Also the class that tends to have to fight our wars for us. He told the truth about that with unrivaled power and honesty."
Larry Curtis Heinemann was born on Jan. 18, 1944, in Chicago. His father, John, owned a small bus company, and his mother, Dorothy (Denton) Heinemann, was a homemaker who also owned a babysitting business.
Mr. Heinemann received an associate's degree at Kendall College in Chicago in 1966, the year he was drafted into the Army. He was sent to Vietnam in 1967 as part of an infantry battalion.
"We were not pleasant people," he wrote of himself and his fellow soldiers in a 1997 essay for the PBS website, "and the war was not a pleasant business. I have no doubt we radicalized more southern Vietnamese to Ho Chi Minh's national revolution than we 'saved."'
He served a year in Vietnam. After leaving the Army in 1968 he returned to Chicago and earned a bachelor's degree at Columbia College Chicago in 1971.
"I was not one of those guys who got home and went to their room and shut up," he told The Los Angeles Times in 1988. "I know guys who the war's been eating up for 20 years. Anybody who asked me about it, I told them. I shot my mouth off about everything -- the whorehouses, the endless hatred, the ugliness, the real work of the war. It took two to three years of talking to get the story out."
Then he wrote the story.
His first novel, "Close Quarters," was published in 1977. It was the tale of an ordinary soldier in Vietnam, starkly told. In Newsweek, Peter S. Prescott reviewed it along with "A Rumor of War," a memoir by another Vietnam veteran, Philip Caputo, that had come out at the same time.
"Larry Heineman in his novel, like Caputo in his memoir, is telling us that the Vietnamese experience was, for Americans, much worse than many of us had imagined," Mr. Prescott wrote. "Each implies that this kind of war, with its peculiar combination of stress and fatigue, of futility and lunatic violence, batters the average American boy loose from his reason -- as well as from whatever moral and spiritual resources he has."
"Paco's Story" largely focused not on the war but on the return to civilian life of its title character, who washes dishes at a diner.
"The Vietnam War continues to elude our attempts to represent it, just as the sublimity of storms and volcanoes challenged artists of earlier generations," Christopher Benfey said in a review in The Times. "Mr. Heinemann's carefully crafted, oblique narrative suggests that the right words are not going to be found in ever-more-graphic, frontal approaches to 'gruesome carnage.' Its horrors may be as forcefully conveyed by a haunting scene in a greasy spoon as by the tearing of human flesh."
In addition to his 2005 memoir, Mr. Heinemann wrote "Cooler by the Lake" (1992), a lighter novel about a family of hustlers in his native Chicago. He also wrote reviews, magazine articles and short stories and held academic posts. He had been writer in residence at Texas A&M University since 2005.
Mr. Heinemann married Edie Smith in 1968; they divorced in 2014. In addition to his daughter, he is survived by his partner, Kathy Favor; a son, Preston; and a granddaughter.
Mr. Heinemann was critical of the line of argument that emerged after the war holding that the conflict had been winnable, and of airbrushed versions of warfare in general.
"Since then, several other wars have come our way, including Iraq and Afghanistan, and I don't know about you, but I have watched and been appalled by the horror-struck nonchalance with which we seem to enjoy them," he wrote in an essay adapted from his memoir. "We are fascinated and repelled simultaneously by the endless loop of televised imagery and skimpy narration, oiled with the patina of exaggerated patriotism. On television, at least, war has been justified and prettified in a way that is truly pornographic."

A Win for Russia's Tech Sector Is Tainted by a Heavy-Handed Police Action

Texto completo: A case linked to a $ 670 million acquisition shows that there may be a limit to the authorities' abuse of law enforcement to advance corrupt business interests.
MOSCOW -- The deal, worth $ 670 million, was a triumph for Russia's tech sector, which is rich in talent but often impoverished by the country's stumbling efforts to market its world-class skills.
The sale to an American company this year of Nginx, a Russian company that developed web server software now used by more than a third of the world's websites, sent a clear message that Russian programmers can create valuable products for the global market.
But that was before Russia's notoriously capricious and aggressive law-enforcement system got involved.
In a series of raids late last week, police officers armed with automatic weapons searched the homes of the company's Russian founders, Igor Sysoyev and Maxim Konovalov, who were taken in for questioning, and also their company's Moscow office. Both men now work for F5 Networks, a Seattle-based tech company that purchased Nginx -- pronounced "engine-x" -- in May.
Amid widespread dismay and anger over the raids, a criminal case initiated by the authorities against Nginx has turned one of Russia's biggest IT success stories into a case study of why the country has so much trouble developing its economy beyond just pulling oil, gas and other natural resources out of the ground.
Aleksandr Belov, the head of an internet start-up incubator at the Moscow Physics and Technology Institute, warned that the case "kills technological progress, kills entrepreneurship, kills the already dead venture market and closes the windows to capital for Russian start-ups."
The police action against Nginx came just weeks after armed security officials raided a prestigious Moscow physics institute as part of a criminal case against a private, high-end optics company that, from rented office space at the Lebedev Physics Institute, had developed a small business processing raw glass imported from China and exporting the finished products abroad.
Aleksandr Gorbunov, an acerbic and hugely popular social media critic of Russia's often lawless law-enforcement agencies, condemned the latest raids as another sign of how Russia is governed by "the law of the jungle, where the only way to survive is to constantly demonstrate your strength over the weak in the hope that stronger animals will leave you alone."
The early morning raids on Mr. Sysoyev and Mr. Konovalov were triggered by a criminal case over claims that Nginx does really not own the software acquired by F5 Networks when it bought their Russian company, which was registered in the British Virgin Islands.
In a summary of the case in a search warrant, a Ministry of Interior investigator, E.A. Spirenkova, said Nginx's popular software belonged to Rambler, a Russian internet and media holding company controlled by a state bank and a well-connected billionaire.
Both Mr. Sysoyev and Mr. Konovalov worked previously at Rambler, which, according to the investigator, has "exclusive rights" to the software they sold. A criminal conspiracy to steal the software, the investigator said, had defrauded Rambler of 51 million rubles, around $ 810,000.
In the face of the public outcry, Rambler executives disowned the criminal case.
Writing on Facebook, Igor Ashmanov, Rambler's former chief executive, dismissed the claims of theft as "frivolous" and "not based on anything at all," a view echoed by many others in Russia's IT sector. A group of former Rambler employees issued a statement saying they were "ashamed" of their former employer, accusing it of "intimidating business and trying to increase its capitalization by commandeering and misappropriating."
Assailed on social media and in the Russian press as a bullying behemoth bent on grabbing a share of the money paid by the American company, Rambler issued a statement on Monday insisting that it had played no role in initiating the criminal case against Nginx and wanted it stopped.
Disputes over intellectual property are a regular feature of the fiercely competitive IT sector around the world, but these are usually adjudicated by courts in civil proceedings. In Russia, such cases quickly escalate into criminal investigations featuring security officers waving guns. Powerful figures in business with connections to the Russian state often use the security forces to extort money or favors from weaker rivals.
Mr. Konovalov, one of the Nginx founders whose Moscow home was raided, denounced the police action in an interview with Meduza, a news portal, as a "typical racket. Simple as that." He said the raids had been "professional and polite, if you exclude the fact that special forces agents were standing around with automatic weapons." Contacted by The New York Times, he declined to comment about accusations that he and his partner, Mr. Sysoyev, had stolen Rambler's intellectual property.
Rambler, in a statement issued after an emergency board meeting on Monday, blamed Lynwood Investments, a Cyprus-registered company controlled by billionaire Aleksandr L. Mamut, a major shareholder in Rambler, for the criminal case against Nginx.
Rambler's board ordered the company's management to ask the law enforcement authorities to "terminate" the criminal case. Rambler's chairman, Lev Khasis, said, "It's natural for tech companies to defend their rights, but these issues should be decided by civil laws."
The decision by Rambler's board to step away from the case does not automatically end the criminal investigation, but it does indicate that at least some powerful forces in Russian business -- including the state-controlled bank Sberbank, which purchased a 46 percent stake in Rambler in August -- want to put an end to the predatory practices that have done so much to stymie Russia's economic development.
The Kremlin, too, has tried to distance itself from the ruckus. President Vladimir V. Putin has for years insisted that Russia's future economic health rests on exploiting its large reserves of scientific and technological talent but has done nothing to rein in law enforcement agencies that keep undermining this goal.
Asked about the raids on Nginx's founders, Mr. Putin's spokesman, Dmitri Peskov, said on Monday that the Kremlin was not involved and could not interfere. Russia, he added, "remains attractive for investment."
F5 Networks also distanced itself from the dispute, insisting in a statement that it was "currently not a party" to the criminal investigation unfolding in Moscow.
In a message to customers, it assured them that all of the disputed Nginx software it purchased was "stored on servers outside of Russia" and that "no other products are developed within Russia."

Texto completo: This week, the U.S. House of Representatives is set to vote on two articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump — only the third time an American president has faced such a vote. This will be a defining moment in our nation’s history, one that will be written about for generations to come and one that lawmakers in Congress will carry for the rest of our lives.
In the face of overwhelming evidence, pressure on lawmakers in Washington to impeach Trump is growing by the hour.
Two polls released this weekend show that a majority of Americans support impeaching and removing Trump from office.
More than 100,000 Americans have pledged to take to the streets at “Nobody Is Above The Law” rallies tonight to demand that both chambers of Congress hold Trump accountable before the House of Representatives votes this week.
A bipartisan coalition — which includes progressive organizations like Stand Up America, MoveOn, and Indivisible as well as conservative groups like Republicans for the Rule of Law — has driven hundreds of thousands of constituent calls to lawmakers urging them to support impeachment.
More than a dozen editorial boards at some of the largest papers in the country—including The New York Times, USA Today, and The Washington Post — have called for Trump to be removed from office.
Several GOP governors also say Congress should impeach Trump, as do former Republican elected officials like former Ohio Gov. John Kasich and ex-Pennsylvania Rep. Charlie Dent.
Yet not a single Republican in Congress has shown a willingness to break with Trump, including three GOP members of Minnesota’s congressional delegation.
But the evidence of Trump’s impeachable conduct is incredibly damaging. During a thorough and transparent investigation by lawmakerss in Congress, it became clear that Trump withheld nearly $400 million in military aid and a critical White House meeting in order to pressure Ukrainian officials into interfering in the 2020 election.
Witness testimony, call transcripts, text messages, and phone records all show that Trump used the power of the presidency for his own personal gain — and that he undermined our rule of law, our foreign policy, and our national security in the process. Then, after a whistleblower and several government officials came forward, Trump and senior members of his administration tried to cover it up by defying congressional subpoenas, concealing evidence, and blocking witnesses from testifying.
As Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar so aptly said, these actions amount to a “global Watergate.”
The only way to address such blatant corruption and likely criminal wrongdoing? Impeachment.
That’s exactly why the House Judiciary Committee voted last week to advance two articles of impeachment against Donald Trump — one focused on his abuses of power and another on his efforts to obstruct Congress.
So lawmakers must now decide: Will they uphold their oaths of office and defend the Constitution by voting to impeach Donald Trump, or will they allow a lawless president to go unchecked?
With the evidence we’ve seen so far, the choice should be clear. Yet only four members of Minnesota’s congressional — Democrats Angie Craig (District 2), Dean Phillips (District 3), Betty McCollum (District 4), and Ilhan Omar (District 5) — have pledged their support for impeachment. Rep. Craig said voting to impeach is “about upholding [her] oath to the Constitution and the rule of law,” while Rep. Phillips said that there is “no alternative.”
A fifth Democrat — Collin Peterson (District 7) — has said that he doesn’t “condone what the president did,” but has not made a decision on whether to support impeachment.
The three Republicans from Minnesota — Jim Hagedorn (District 1), Tom Emmer (District 6), and Pete Stauber (District 8) — have said they oppose impeachment, with Stauber going so far as to claim that Trump committed “no high crimes and misdemeanors.”
But with the evidence of Trump’s impeachable conduct uncontested and the process barreling toward the finish line in the House of Representatives, a reckoning is coming. Every member of Congress must evaluate whether he or she will be on the right side of history after taking this vote.
For the sake of our democracy, I implore every single one of our representatives to vote to impeach.
Ryan Thomas is the national press secretary for St and Up America , one of the largest grassroots organizations in the country working on impeachment. He is a Minnesota native from Andover.

Paul Krugman: Trump’s trade wars made American weak again

Texto completo: Trade wars rarely have victors. They do, however, sometimes have losers. And Donald Trump has definitely turned out to be a loser.
Of course, that’s not the way he and his team are portraying the tentative deal they’ve struck with China, which they’re claiming as a triumph. The reality is that the Trump administration achieved almost none of its goals; it has basically declared victory while going into headlong retreat.
And the Chinese know it. As The Times reports, Chinese officials are “jubilant and even incredulous” at the success of their hard-line negotiating strategy.
To understand what just went down, you need to ask what Trump and company were trying to accomplish with their tariffs, and how that compares with what really happened.
First and foremost, Trump wanted to slash the U.S. trade deficit. Economists more or less unanimously consider this the wrong objective, but in Trump’s mind countries win when they sell more than they buy, and nobody is going to convince him otherwise.
So it’s remarkable to note that the trade deficit has risen, not fallen, on Trump’s watch, from $544 billion in 2016 to $691 billion in the 12 months ending in October.
And what Trump wanted in particular was to close the trade deficit in manufactured goods; despite giving lip service to “great Patriot Farmers,” it’s clear that he actually has contempt for agricultural exports. Last summer, complaining about the U.S. trade relationship with Japan, he sneered: “We send them wheat. Wheat. That’s not a good deal.”
So now we appear to have a trade deal with China whose main substantive element is … a promise to buy more U.S. farm goods.
Trump’s team also wanted to put the brakes on China’s drive to establish itself as the world’s economic superpower. “China is basically trying to steal the future,” declared Peter Navarro, a top trade adviser, a year ago. But the new deal, while it includes some promises to protect intellectual property, leaves the core of China’s industrial strategy — what’s been called the “vast web of subsidies that has fueled the global rise of many Chinese companies” — untouched.
So why did Trump wimp out on trade?
At a broad level, the answer is that he was suffering from delusions of grandeur. America was never going to succeed in bullying a huge, proud nation whose economy is already, by some measures, larger than ours — especially while simultaneously alienating other advanced economies that might have joined us in pressuring China to change some of its economic policies.
At a more granular level, none of the pieces of Trump trade strategy have worked as promised.
Although Trump has repeatedly insisted that China is paying his tariffs, the facts say otherwise: Chinese export prices haven’t gone down, which means that the tariffs are falling on U.S. consumers and companies. And the bite on consumers would have gone up substantially if Trump hadn’t called off the round of further tariff increases that had been scheduled for this past Sunday.
At the same time, Chinese retaliation has hit some U.S. exporters, farmers in particular, hard. And while Trump may quietly hold farm exports in contempt, he needs those rural votes — votes that were being put at risk despite a farm bailout that has already cost more than twice as much as Barack Obama’s bailout of the auto industry.
Finally, uncertainty over tariff policy was clearly hurting manufacturing and business investment, even as overall economic growth remained solid.
So Trump, as I said, basically declared victory and retreated.
Will Trump’s trade defeat hurt him politically? Probably not. Many Americans will surely buy the spin, and the trade war was never popular anyway.
Furthermore, voting mostly reflects the economy’s direction, not its level — not whether things are good, but whether they’ve been getting better recently. It may actually be good political strategy to do stupid things for a while, then stop doing them around a year before the election, which is a fair summary of Trump’s trade actions.
There will, however, be longer-term costs to the trade war. For one thing, the business uncertainty created by Trump’s capriciousness won’t go away; he is, after all, a master of the art of the broken deal.
Beyond that, Trump’s trade antics have damaged America’s reputation.
On one side, our allies have learned not to trust us. We have, after all, become the kind of country that suddenly slaps tariffs on Canada — Canada! — on obviously spurious claims that we’re protecting national security.
On the other side, our rivals have learned not to fear us. Like the North Koreans, who flattered Trump but kept on building nukes, the Chinese have taken Trump’s measure. They now know that he talks loudly but carries a small stick, and backs down when confronted in ways that might hurt him politically.
These things matter. Having a leader who is neither trusted by our erstwhile friends nor feared by our foreign rivals reduces our global influence in ways we’re just starting to see. Trump’s trade war didn’t achieve any of its goals, but it did succeed in making America weak again.

Democratic leaders push to end labor dispute and save debate

Texto completo: Democratic officials are pushing for an end to a labor dispute that threatens the party's sixth presidential primary debate, scheduled for Thursday on a California university campus.
Xochitl Hinojosa, the Democratic National Committee's communications director and a lead debate organizer for DNC chairman Tom Perez, said Monday that Perez “spent the entire weekend" urging stakeholders to engage in good-faith, mediated negotiations. He's seeking a resolution to the dispute between the food services company Sodexo and about 150 of its employees who work on the Loyola Marymount University campus that is scheduled to host the debate.
The seven candidates who have qualified for the debate have all said they would not attend a Loyola debate if the dispute persists, and at least nine candidates in the Democratic race have expressed solidarity with the UNITE HERE Local 11 amid collective bargaining that involves disagreements over wages and health care benefits.
The DNC is not looking for an alternate debate site.
A local union leader said talks with Sodexo could resume Tuesday.
Sodexo spokesman Enrico Dinges said in an e-mail that the company is “100 percent committed" to reaching an agreement and remains at the bargaining table.
UNITE HERE attracted immediate attention last week with its promise to picket Thursday's debate, prompting quick statements from Perez and presidential candidates. Progressive Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont were the first to say they'd boycott the debate. Former vice president Joe Biden; Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota; South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg; entrepreneur Andrew Yang; and billionaire activist Tom Steyer followed suit.

President threatens to bypass debate commission
President Trump made clear Monday that he intends to participate in at least three general election debates, but he is threatening to sidestep the nonprofit charged with running them.
“I look very much forward to debating whoever the lucky person is who stumbles across the finish line in the little watched Do Nothing Democrat Debates," Trump tweeted Monday morning after The New York Times reported that he was considering skipping them entirely.
Trump said his record “is so good" that “perhaps I would consider more than 3 debates." But he also complained, without evidence, that the Commission on Presidential Debates is “stacked with Trump Haters & Never Trumpers" and threatened to bypass them.
“As President, the debates are up.......to me, and there are many options, including doing them directly & avoiding the nasty politics of this very biased Commission," Trump wrote, adding that he would “make a decision at an appropriate time."
Trump tussled with the commission and Fox News about the debates during the 2016 election cycle.
He incorrectly claimed Monday on Twitter that the commission was “forced to publicly apologize for modulating my microphone" in the first general election debate against Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in September 2016.
In a statement, the commission said, “The televised general election debates are an important part of our democratic process." It said the commission has conducted 30 general election presidential and vice presidential debates since 1988.

Judge permits Georgia voter roll purges prior to hearing
A federal judge is allowing Georgia to proceed with a mass purge of its voting rolls planned for Monday evening, but he also scheduled a hearing later in the week to hear more arguments about the matter.
That decision came after a lawyer for the state assured him that if the judge finds later that some people should not have been removed, they can be easily and quickly reinstated.
Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger in October released a list of over 313,000 voters whose registrations were at risk of being canceled, about 4 percent of the state's total registered voters.
Notices were mailed in November giving those voters 30 days to respond to keep their registration valid. A spokesman for the secretary of state's office said last week that the purge was set to begin Monday evening.
Fair Fight Action, a voting rights group founded by Democrat Stacey Abrams, had filed an emergency request Monday morning asking the court to halt the purge of some people.
US District Judge Steve Jones initially set a hearing on Fair Fight's request for Thursday and said the purge should be placed on hold until then, but he later decided to hold a hearing Monday afternoon at the state's request.

Men get probation for trying to access Trump tax returns
Two men were sentenced Monday to probation and community service for trying to hack the IRS to obtain President Trump's tax returns.
Andrew Harris, 23, of Philadelphia, and Justin Hiemstra, 22, of St. Paul Park, Minn., both previously pleaded guilty to federal charges of computer fraud.
Harris and Hiemstra were students at Haverford College outside Philadelphia in 2016 when they used a school computer lab to open a fraudulent federal financial aid application for an unnamed Trump family member.
The students managed to reset a password and, using Trump's Social Security number and date of birth, repeatedly tried to import Trump's federal tax information into the application, according to court documents.
The Department of Education and IRS detected the attempts.
A federal judge gave each defendant two years' probation and 200 hours of community service.

Can an old newspaper learn new tricks? Absolutely.

Texto completo: One of the earliest and most vivid memories I have of holding this newspaper is as a young teenager. My dad, who worked on the presses, would arrive home after dark carrying crisp, folded copies of that day’s Lancaster New Era and Intelligencer Journal in one hand and an ink-blotched lunch pail in the other. I’d sit at the kitchen table, leafing through both papers until dinnertime.
I marveled at the idea that, at the instant the ink hit the newsprint, those pages conveyed information and ideas that would immediately become the shared knowledge of an entire community. The couples who had given birth. The families mourning a death. The weddings and graduations and milestones, both celebratory and somber, in the lives being lived in Lancaster County.
This was in the 1980s, when the press crew was putting in 14-hour shifts to learn how to run the company’s new $13.5 million Man Roland “Flexoman.” The move from direct lithography, or “di litho,” to a new printing technology called flexography, used by only a few newspapers in North America at the time, was a difficult one.
A thank you from LNP's publisher, president as we celebrate 225 years: You inspire us
It would allow for the use of color pictures throughout the newspaper and, more importantly, a water-based ink that wouldn’t rub off on your hands. But getting to that ideal, getting the Flexoman to cooperate, was easier said than done. “We put out some ugly-looking papers at times,” my dad told me some time ago.
The long days, the new press, the first few ugly papers three decades ago — they were about learning a new technology, about embracing innovation, about navigating the uneven path of progress.
Sound familiar?
Yes, this is what we still do today.
This is what our news organization has done for 225 years.
And despite the forecasts of doom and gloom — I was in the room when New York Times executive editor Dean Baquet predicted most local newspapers would die in the next five years — we will keep finding new ways to tell your stories.
Change is a constant. We get that. And we will adapt. We will keep getting better.
As the new executive editor of LNP | LancasterOnline, I assure you our reporters, editors, artists and photographers will continue producing the finest, most comprehensive and impartial news report on our community you can find anywhere.
We are sharpening our focus on the topics and issues you care most about. The quality of your drinking water. The rising cost of health care. The safety of your neighborhoods. The irresponsible development of productive farmland. The traffic-choked network of pikes from the city to the suburbs. And carefully researched, fearless investigative reporting on our government institutions.
We are able to do this because of your support, and because of the support of our advertisers.
LNP announces move, new press, commitment to downtown at 225-year anniversary fete
LNP | LancasterOnline, unlike many community newspapers, benefits from a growing base of subscribers, who allow us to provide coverage that is deeper and more comprehensive than most newspapers our size. It is an exception in an industry that has been decimated by layoffs and the steep decline in advertising revenue, an existential threat.
Two-thirds of U.S. counties do not have a daily newspaper. In those that do, most have been gutted by their hedge-fund owners, leaving news deserts in their wake. The number of newsroom employees has fallen from 71,000 in 2008 to just 38,000 as of 2018.
We are not immune.
But we’ve found new ways to report on our community. We’ve launched a journalism fellowship program for emerging minority reporters, and our first — Hurubie Meko — has been hitting it out of the ballpark with her reporting on contaminants in private wells across Lancaster County. In 2020, we will bring on a new fellow and reporting interns.
We’ve obtained grant money for testing more wells for our readers and those concerned about the quality of their drinking water.
Lancaster newspaper archives from 1795 to now will be available online; here's how to explore them
In 2020, we will enter our fourth year of publishing The Caucus, our award-winning weekly newspaper that does investigative reporting on state government and politics. To expand our reach and enhance our reporting, we’ve teamed up with journalists at WITF and PA Post; The Inquirer in Philadelphia; The Patriot-News in Harrisburg; and The Post-Gazette in Pittsburgh. We’re partners in Spotlight PA, the investigative reporting news organization in Harrisburg.
We’ve teamed up with a nonprofit law firms and law school clinics to fight for public access to government records.
Earlier this month, the nonprofit group Investigative Reporters & Editors chose LNP | LancasterOnline to be one of 10 sites across the country for an intensive training program that will allow our reporters and editors to sharpen their investigative skills and better serve as watchdogs on our local government institutions.
Working in the community, we’ll host debates and open those forums up to the public next year, when members of Congress and the Legislature are up for election. We’ll hold Democracy Day for high school students to learn more about issues facing our government and the importance of media literacy.
Readers reminisce on newspaper memories in celebration of LNP's 225th anniversary
LNP Media Group President Caroline Muraro and her teams in advertising and marketing are finding creative new ways to make sure local businesses are successful. Shane Zimmerman, president of The Steinman Foundation, works with seed money from this news organization to fund community journalism and media literacy programs, workforce development programs, and STEM and early-childhood education.
There are lots of amazing, innovative and just plain cool things happening inside LNP | LancasterOnline. There are lots of amazing, innovative and cool things happening in Lancaster County.
And we’re here to report on them.
Like the talented and versatile press crews who tamed the Flexoman, like the reporters and editors who gave up their typewriters for terminals, we’re learning every day. We’re adapting to change. We’re finding new ways to deliver news to you.
And we’re able to do it because of your support.
Thank you.

Texto completo: Rachel Glenn loves to puree food and put it in her 4-year-old’s feeding tube. The Arkansas mom said her thick concoctions of fruit, vegetables, meat and grains provide the concentrated nutrition he needs.
When he was on formula, Asher, who can’t swallow due to a brainstem condition, vomited several times a day. Since his mom started making his meals in a blender, when he was about 15 months old, that has stopped and Asher has more energy. Plus: “He gets his two cups of greens a day and he doesn’t argue about it.”
So Glenn was upset to learn about a new type of connector being promoted for feeding-tube equipment that could prevent her son from consuming her home-blended food. It has a one-size-fits-all opening that’s much narrower than the holes on syringes she currently uses to push food through the feeding tube implanted in his abdomen.
When Glenn and her husband tried using a syringe tipped with one of the new plastic connectors, called ENFit, they could barely get Asher’s food to budge. She worries her son’s health will suffer if manufacturers start putting ENFit connectors on all feeding devices.
“We feel being forced back onto formula is unfair to him,” said Glenn. “I don’t see any evidence that they have taken the needs of actual tube-feeding families into consideration.”
As the new connector standard intended to prevent deadly errors in hospitals has been introduced in the niche device industry, patients and their families who use feeding tubes long term at home say their concerns have been largely ignored. The ability to consume normal food and control their nutrition is a precious benefit they fear could vanish.
Some critics say ENFit also creates new risks, including dosing errors and infections among preemie babies.
ENFit sprung from an industry effort backed by patient safety groups and the Food and Drug Administration to create a global system of connectors that would prevent devices with different functions from being linked.
Both the Joint Commission, which accredits hospitals, and the World Health Organization flagged such misconnections as a risk more than a decade ago. In 2010, The New York Times drew attention to the issue with a case of a pregnant woman who died after a bag of formula was connected to her IV port.
An industry committee, led by an FDA official, convened to set a standard for feeding-tube connectors. Some manufacturers began investing in production and marketing years before the standard was approved in 2016.
At some point, “the ‘P’ that stood for patient safety that should have been in the center of decision-making was changed for a ‘P’ that stood for profit,” said Maureen Burger, chief nursing officer at Visante, a pharmacy consulting firm based in St. Paul, Minn. Her firm has served as a consultant for Becton Dickinson and Co., a leading syringe maker.
Unintended Consequences
ENFit syringes have an empty space at the tip where medication and food can get trapped, potentially leading to bacterial contamination as well as dosing inaccuracy that can be especially hazardous for tiny infants. One study found ENFit syringes delivered the wrong dose about a fifth of the time.
Babies with neonatal abstinence syndrome are weaned off drugs — often with morphine every three hours for 30 days, said Keliana O’Mara, a pharmacist at the University of Florida Health Shands Hospital in Gainesville, Fla., who co-authored the study. “That’s 240 chances to have a problem with dosing accuracy.”
That hasn’t stopped a trade group from pushing hospitals to convert all their equipment — including the feeding tubes implanted in patients as well as tubes and syringes used to deliver food and medicine — to ENFit. In July, the Global Enteral Device Supplier Association startled many people by announcing that its member manufacturers would begin phasing out non-ENFit products next year.
In response to questions, association Executive Director Michael Cusack referred to a document on the organization’s “Stay Connected” website that says there have been “no reported misconnections, dosing concerns, or major transition problems” with ENFit in the United Kingdom, where adoption has been widespread.
While the entrance of new connectors is causing distress for home users — who call themselves “tubies” — some experts say it has not done much of anything to address the problem it was supposed to resolve.
“It was poorly designed, it was poorly thought out, and it doesn’t get at the root of the misconnections,” said Shelley Buma, who owns a medical device design firm in Massachusetts.
While the suppliers association highlights tragic cases of patients hurt or killed by misconnections, some of its critics say ENFit doesn’t fix any misconnection hazards. They say it would not have prevented any of 23 feeding-tube misconnection events reported to the FDA between 2005 and 2016.
“That’s really a point of outrage for me,” Buma said.
By the time the design was approved, misconnection risks with feeding tubes had largely been mitigated, at least in the U.S., said Buma.
What’s more, she added, ENFit’s design created unnecessary challenges for the growing population of tubies, many of whom use funnel connectors and catheter tip syringes with wide openings that she said have no risk of misconnection with other devices.
Beyond problems with blended food, tubies complain of slower flow rates for formula, the clogging of medication and a screw-on design that’s a barrier for people with limited use of their hands, such as those with arthritis.
The Push To Switch
The suppliers association has petitioned for the FDA, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and the Joint Commission to take steps that would compel universal adoption. So far, that hasn’t happened.
While there’s no mandate, some hospitals came to believe a shift to ENFit was inevitable. “The message most people got was, ‘You have to convert because it’s going to be required in the future,’” said O’Mara, whose own hospital system aborted a switch to ENFit last year after taking a closer look at the effect on patient care.
And reluctance to make the change appears to be widespread. A suppliers association survey in 2018 showed 28% of U.S. hospitals had transitioned to ENFit, though some industry experts said they believe the adoption rate is lower.
Some manufacturers also have resisted a switch to ENFit. Becton Dickinson left the supplier association in 2015 citing ENFit dosing safety. The company said it’s developing an alternative design that will be available to all manufacturers and will comply with the standard without a misdosing risk.
French neonatal manufacturer and association member Vygon and Ohio-based feeding-tube maker Applied Medical Technology have said they will keep non-ENFit devices on the market.
Still, the push for ENFit has left some tubies feeling burned. They are angry that formula makers such as Nestle and Abbott Laboratories served on the standards committee and joined the suppliers association, though it is unclear whether those companies held sway in selecting a design that ultimately appears to serve their interests.
Nestle and Abbott declined to comment on their involvement.
Tubies worry their trusty devices could disappear, forcing them to rely on commercial formula that is costlier and, some believe, less nutritious than regular food.
“It’s my great concern that as more and more unknowing tubies are supplied with ENFit, the demand for legacy products will be diminished,” said David Rowland, an 80-year-old South Carolina resident who co-founded a group called Tubies Against ENFit.
Some, like the Glenn family, say they are hoarding supplies, just in case.

Judiciary Committee report argues Trump ‘betrayed the nation’

Texto completo: Washington • The House Judiciary Committee formally presented its case for impeaching President Donald Trump in a 658-page report published online early Monday, arguing just days before a final vote in the House that he “betrayed the nation by abusing his high office.”
The report, which echoes similar documents produced after the committee’s approval of impeachment articles for Presidents Richard M. Nixon and Bill Clinton, contains no new allegations or evidence against Trump.
But it offers a detailed road map for the two articles of impeachment the committee approved, charging that Trump abused the power of the presidency to enlist Ukraine in tarnishing his political rivals and obstructing Congress by blocking witnesses from testifying and refusing to provide documents.
The House is expected to vote Wednesday on whether to impeach the sitting president for only the third time in the nation’s history, setting in motion a trial in the Senate early next year that could lead to Trump’s removal from office.
“President Trump has placed his personal, political interests above our national security, our free and fair elections, and our system of checks and balances,” the report states. “He has engaged in a pattern of misconduct that will continue if left unchecked. Accordingly, President Trump should be impeached and removed from office.”
The report argues that the House should charge Trump with abuse of power for holding up nearly $400 million worth of security aid and the promise of a White House meeting until Ukraine agreed to announce investigations into former Vice President Joe Biden and 2016 election interference.
“When the president demands that a foreign government announce investigations targeting his domestic political rival, he corrupts our elections,” the report states. “To the founders, this kind of corruption was especially pernicious, and plainly merited impeachment. American elections should be for Americans only.”
It also urges the House to approve an article of impeachment charging the president with obstruction of Congress, saying that “President Trump’s obstruction of Congress does not befit the leader of a democratic society. It calls to mind the very claims of royal privilege against which our founders rebelled.”
The report includes a scathing 20-page dissent from Rep. Doug Collins of Georgia, the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee, who accuses Democrats on the panel of conducting an unfair process in a partisan attempt to drive Trump from office because of their dislike of him and his policies.
“The case is not only weak but dangerously lowers the bar for future impeachments,” he writes. “The record put forth by the majority is based on inferences built upon presumptions and hearsay. In short, the majority has failed to make a credible, factually-based allegation against this president that merits impeachment.”
Collins concludes: “Before the House are two articles of impeachment against the president of the United States, Donald John Trump. To these articles, the minority dissents.”
The report by the Democratic-controlled committee rejects the criticism that the impeachment inquiry was unfair to Trump and Republicans, arguing that the president had many opportunities to have his lawyer present evidence or cross-examine witnesses during the inquiry.
“The president’s decision to reject these opportunities to participate affirms that his principal objective was to obstruct the House’s inquiry rather than assist in its full consideration of all relevant evidence,” the report states.

Texto completo: Washington • Democrats vowed Sunday to push forward this week with the third impeachment of a sitting president in history, a move Republicans denounced as a grave and partisan misuse of the Constitution’s power to hold a president accountable.
Democrats showed no sign of slowing down even as one of their few members to oppose impeachment, Rep. Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey, planned to switch parties, and Republican senators lined up to announce their intentions to acquit the president.
The debate about impeachment came as James Comey, the former FBI director, acknowledged that he was wrong when, in a separate investigation of President Donald Trump, he said there were no problems with the warrants used to approve surveillance for an adviser to the president’s 2016 campaign.
Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y. and the Democratic chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, which Friday approved articles of impeachment against Trump, said the president deserved to be impeached for pressuring Ukraine’s government to investigate his political rivals and obstructing Congress.

Nadler accused Trump of continuing to solicit foreign help in the 2020 elections and urged Republicans to join with Democrats in the House to impeach him during the vote expected Wednesday, a prospect that appeared increasingly remote.
“This is a crime in progress against the Constitution and against the American democracy,” Nadler said on ABC’s “This Week.” “We cannot take the risk that the next election will be corrupted through foreign interference solicited by the president, which he is clearly trying to do. It goes to the heart of our democracy.”
Republicans defended Trump, insisting that after a nearly three-month investigation, Democrats had failed to prove that the president committed a crime. Rep. Will Hurd, R-Texas, who has criticized the president’s behavior in the Ukraine matter, nonetheless said he would vote against impeaching him.
“My fear is that you weaponize impeachment for political gains in the future,” Hurd said on CNN’s “State of the Union.” “For me, my standard for impeachment has always been a violation of the law.”
Members of both parties, considering Trump’s impeachment in the House a foregone conclusion, turned their attention Sunday to a trial in the Senate early next year.
A group of more than two dozen freshman Democrats in the House is quietly lobbying for Rep. Justin Amash of Michigan, an independent who left the Republican Party this year, to serve as one of the six or more impeachment managers to present the case against Trump during the Senate trial.
Amash has been an outspoken proponent of the president’s impeachment, and the freshman lawmakers believe his selection would be a sign of bipartisanship. The idea, which was first reported by The Washington Post, appeals to moderate Democrats from conservative-leaning districts where the president is popular who are wary of joining in a one-sided impeachment vote and looking for ways to show they pushed for a fair process.
“If he would be willing to do it, it would send all the right signals to have a principled, constitutional conservative front and center in a process that is not supposed to be partisan,” said Rep. Tom Malinowski, D-N.J.
Speaker Nancy Pelosi will have the final say on who serves as managers, which are high-profile, coveted spots for Democratic lawmakers. A final decision is likely early this week, but Pelosi, who has kept tight control over the impeachment process so far, has given no indication that she would be willing to invite anyone but a loyalist to serve as the face of the House impeachment investigation.
A spokesman for Pelosi declined to comment about the possible selection of Amash as an impeachment manager. A person close to the impeachment inquiry said it would be highly unlikely that the speaker would risk appointing Amash when several of her own members are eager to be managers.
Two Republican senators said they had already decided they would vote to acquit Trump.
Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, predicted that the president would be cleared of the charges against him in the Senate.
“I think this is the beginning of the end for this show trial that we’ve seen in the House,” Cruz said. “I think it’s going to come to the Senate. We’re going to have fair proceedings, and then it’s not going anywhere because the facts aren’t there.”
Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said he hoped the Republican-led Senate would conduct a short impeachment trial that can be over quickly, without calling numerous witnesses on both sides.
“I think what’s best for the country is to get this thing over with,” Graham said on CBS’ “Face the Nation.” “I’m not trying to hide the fact that I have disdain for the accusations in the process.”
The Republican leader in the Senate, Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, has also voiced support for a short, dignified trial, even though Trump has privately pushed for a longer process that would allow him and his allies to mount an aggressive defense against what he has repeatedly called “a hoax” being perpetrated on the American people.
Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif. and the Democratic chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Sunday condemned McConnell and others for seeking to conduct a trial without demanding testimony and documents that the White House refused to provide to House investigators.
“They don’t want the American people to see the facts,” Schiff said on “This Week.” “There’s more damning evidence to be had, and they don’t want the American people to see that, and I think that’s disgraceful.”
Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., said that if the Senate proceeding was “dismissed on the first day, obviously that’s not a full and fair trial.” And he said he was worried about what the president would do if he was not removed from office.
“If the Senate Republican majority refuses to discipline him through impeachment, he will be unbounded,” Coons said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” “And I’m gravely concerned about what else he might do between now and the 2020 election, when there are no restrictions on his behavior.”
The admission from Comey came just days after the inspector general for the Justice Department, Michael Horowitz, released a report in which he found “17 significant inaccuracies and omissions” in the applications the FBI submitted to a court to surveil Carter Page, a onetime foreign policy adviser on Trump’s campaign. The surveillance of Page was one part of the investigation into the contacts between Russia and Trump’s 2016 campaign.
Comey, who was fired by Trump in May 2017, had previously said the case involving Page was handled in a “thoughtful, responsible way” during the time he was director of the agency.
“I was wrong,” Comey said on “Fox News Sunday.” “The inspector general found significant mistakes, and that is not something to sneeze at. That’s really important.”
Trump seized on Comey’s admission to attack him.
“So now Comey’s admitting he was wrong,” he said on Twitter on Sunday. “Wow, but he’s only doing so because he got caught red handed. He was actually caught a long time ago. So what are the consequences for his unlawful conduct. Could it be years in jail? Where are the apologies to me and others, Jim?”
But Comey noted that the inspector general did not find evidence of the most serious charges of political bias and a “deep state” conspiracy that Trump and his allies have leveled against the FBI in the years since the 2016 campaign.
He firmly defended the FBI, saying the bureau had been proved to be honest and apolitical but “flawed.”
“The inspector general did not find misconduct by FBI personnel, did not find political bias, did not find illegal conduct,” Comey said. “The American people — especially your viewers — need to realize they were given false information about the FBI.”

Texto completo: Jack Davison's photographs capture this year's best actors with a minimalist and inventive approach.
Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
Released in December, just before awards season, the Great Performers Issue is one of The New York Times Magazine's most anticipated of the year. After watching many hours of movies released in 2019, The Times's co-chief film critic A.O. Scott and critic-at-large Wesley Morris narrowed down their choices for most striking performances in film this year to 10 actors: Adam Driver, Scarlett Johansson, Jennifer Lopez, Elisabeth Moss, Brad Pitt, Leonardo DiCaprio, Lupita Nyong'o, Julianne Moore, Antonio Banderas and Robert De Niro. All 10 appear in this weekend's issue of the magazine.
Mr. Scott and Mr. Morris finalized their list in October. That left about a month for the magazine's photo director and deputy photo director, Kathy Ryan and Jessica Dimson, to commission the London-based photographer Jack Davison and to wrangle all 10 celebrity subjects for portraits. Mr. Davison first photographed the Great Performers in 2016, and accompanying those photos were nine original virtual-reality films by the director Gina Prince-Bythewood. Last year, the choreographer Justin Peck created pieces of dance for each actor to perform in a series of short films for The Times, with photos by Philip Montgomery. This year, for the first time in a long time, the staff decided to focus solely on the actors and their craft. No accompanying experiential projects. Just stories and photos.
The visual concept was to be stripped down, too, said Ms. Dimson, so it felt natural to ask Mr. Davison to return to shoot this year. "Jack's work pulls away from the artifice" of celebrity, she said. "What he's presenting is real."
Deceptive in their simplicity, Mr. Davison's black-and-white photos can trick a viewer's brain for half a beat before the subjects' identities click into place. He shot the portraits on film, "so we didn't even quite know what the end result was going to be," Ms. Dimson said. That sense of uncertainty was cloaked in more mystery when he incorporated materials like sheets of glass, fabrics and glass jars on set. Not knowing what photos will look like right away can be "disarming to big-name talent," Ms. Dimson said. "They had a lot of trust in him."
"You have to kind of read the room," Mr. Davison said. Some actors asked questions and wanted to collaborate; others wanted him to do his thing. Mr. Pitt, for one, "was quite interested in what the materials did when I was shooting through them," Mr. Davison recalled. Mr. Banderas even got playful. All told, Mr. Davison spent two days shooting in Los Angeles, two more in New York and one in Spain (to shoot Mr. Banderas).
All of the setups comprised a simple background with what Ms. Dimson described as "an abundance of light," whether streaming through a window in a studio or shining above on a rooftop. Having been on set for almost all of the shoots, Ms. Dimson could look back at this minimalist approach and appreciate the remarkable difference between the portraits. "On each shoot, he pulled something from within the person, and they all feel like unique images in vastly different ways," she said.
Consider the soft contrast on Scarlett Johansson's face, the delicate sculpted light around Lupita Nyong'o. Then the fractured features of Leonardo DiCaprio, the dreamy ethereality of Jennifer Lopez and the shard of harsh sun on Adam Driver's profile, otherwise engulfed in darkness. Readers won't see every photo from the shoots, but Mr. Davison said he created layers of distortion for each one.
"There's a really weird one of Robert De Niro that I really like that's about as abstract as you could possibly go," in which the actor's nose, facial mole and furrowed brow are barely perceptible through heavily abstracted glass, Mr. Davison said. He likes the cover of Mr. Driver for the same reason: "It shows how little you can show of someone to still be recognizable."
"Jack sees it," Ms. Dimson said. "He knows when he holds up a piece of glass that it's going to have a certain sort of distortion, but it's still so elegant and so finely tuned."
In the end, the shoots revealed the essence of the actors: both as themselves and in the transformations they experience to become someone else for the camera. In that respect, Ms. Dimson said, "I think it's refreshing for them to just be seen as they are."

It's time for U.S. to dramatically disarm its citizenry

Texto completo: I write in response to a recent New Mexican article (" 'Sad reality': Student kills two classmates at Calif. high school," Nov. 15), which first appeared in the New York Times. Once again there's a fatal shooting at a school. The 16-year-old shooter died from self-inflicted wounds. While not covered as widely, the same day there were two people injured by gunfire at a high school football game in Pleasantville, N.J. There is much talk about such incidents but, sadly, almost no action. From my perspective, the basic problem is the absurd number of guns in the hands of the American public.Our country has over 11 times as many guns per 100 citizens as the world average. There are about 88 gun deaths per day in the U.S. Barely 2 percent of these are mass shootings, over 80 percent are suicides and the rest are domestic arguments, police shootings and accidents. The availability of a gun makes a suicide or domestic incident much more likely to result in death. After the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, much was said but nothing was done. My wife and I believe the same lack of action will continue to occur. If the killing of so many innocent children and school staff can't promote action, what can?
We're not protesting guns for hunting. In New Mexico, as other areas, hunting provides winter food for many families. For many Native American tribes, the Hunter's Moon comes after September's Harvest Moon. In our pueblos, the Hunt Chief is one of the chiefs of the Winter People. When we lived in northern Italy, we learned licensed hunters had to keep their rifles or shotguns in the questura, police station, except during the hunting season.
Consider this sad but incomplete list (the numbers are the best I can determine): Dec. 14, 2012, a 20-year-old fatally shot 20 children and six adult staff at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn; Oct. 1, 2017, a gunman shot concertgoers at a music festival in Las Vegas, Nev., leaving 59 people dead and 869 injured (413 by gunfire); Nov. 5, 2017, a gunman in Sutherland Springs, Texas, killed 26 people and wounded 20 at the First Baptist Church; and on Feb. 14, 2018, a gunman opened fire at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., killing 17 people and injuring 17. A semi-automatic rifle was used in all of these shootings. The Las Vegas shooter had 24 guns; 14 were AR-15 types with bump stocks that allowed them to function as automatics. The list goes on and on.
Palliative ideas, like a universal and more thorough "background check," are just that. There's no way to reduce overall gun deaths without seriously reducing the number of guns in private hands. Banning the AR-15 and other semi-automatics seems an obvious and enforceable measure. Several presidential candidates have suggested a mandatory buy-back program to collect such weapons already in public hands. Realize that this might reduce school and other mass shootings; however, it would not significantly lower the overall number of gun-related deaths.
The National Rifle Association was once an organization promoting hunting and marksmanship; now it promotes gun production and sales. We have police to protect us; private ownership of guns for self-protection promotes higher earnings for gun manufacturers, accidental shootings and a large fraction of our gun deaths.
Our country should dramatically disarm its citizenry. Alas, I realize this is very unlikely given our present beliefs and mentality.

Texto completo: Award-winning New York Times bestselling author Karen Abbott adds to her popular lineup of historical nonfiction with "The Ghosts of Eden Park" – a surprising memoir of the life and times of George Remus, the 1920s teetotaling opportunist whose skyrocketing rise to "King of the Bootleggers" during Prohibition would end in tragedy.
An instant New York Times bestseller, Indie Next pick, Amazon best book of August, and a top fall title for both Newsweek and Publishers Weekly, the book is as important for its historical worth (many of the characters in this real-life saga have been practically wiped off the historical map of America's past) as for its entertainment value.
Abbott's work has also appeared in the Wall Street Journal, the Washington Post, Smithsonian Magazine, and other publications. Her previous books include "Sin in the Second City," "American Rose," and "Liar Temptress Soldier Spy."
A native of Philadelphia, she now lives in New York.
Tell me how you first learned about George Remus's true story, and why it caught your attention and inspired you to write "Ghosts of Eden Park."
I usually get my ideas by perusing old archives and out-of-print books, but this one came through television – specifically the show "Boardwalk Empire," which aired on HBO for five seasons. There was a minor character named George Remus. He spoke of himself in the third person and stole every scene he was in. I wondered if Remus was a real person, and indeed he was! His real story was much more dramatic than the show's portrayal, with a sordid love triangle, a devastating betrayal, a murder, and a sensational trial.
The real Remus also spoke of himself in the third person: "This is going to be a hell of a Christmas for Remus"; "Remus has been betrayed by everyone he had trusted"; and my favorite: "Remus's brain exploded."
In all my years of researching history, I have never come across a more interesting, bizarre, and brazenly outlandish character. He was an impoverished, abused German immigrant kid who, through determination and savvy, became the most successful bootlegger in American history. Within a year of launching his operation, he owned 35 percent of all the liquor in the United States – an astonishing figure. Newspapers at the time compared him to Vanderbilt and Rockefeller.
At the height of Prohibition, Remus lived an "outrageous" lifestyle on many levels, using his background as both pharmacist and lawyer to game the system. Can you give us an example about Remus's story that you would say proves the old saying that "truth is stranger than fiction?"
Remus is said to be a real-life inspiration for Jay Gatsby, mainly because of his lavish parties. The most famous was his 1921 New Year's Eve party, when he unveiled his brand-new Greco-Roman bath, built for $175,000. At one end stood a variety of Turkish and Swedish needle baths, a style and pressure for every taste, and even electric baths – an early version of a tanning bed, heated by incandescent lights and said to make the user "frisky." Remus's glamorous wife, Imogene, put on a daring one-piece and executed a perfect dive. Remus handed out party favors: diamond stickpins and watches for the men, 1922 cars for the women, and a $1,000 bill tucked under everyone's plate. In a gesture emblematic of the times, one what would be remembered in awe decades later, Remus lit guests' cigars with $100 bills. All this in an era when the average annual salary was about $1,200.
Mabel Walker Willebrandt has been called "the most powerful woman in the country" at the time when she became the assistant attorney general of the United States in 1921 and took on the challenging task of enforcing the National Prohibition Act, which prohibited the manufacture and sale of alcoholic beverages. Tell us about her role in this story.
When President Warren Harding appointed Willebrandt to be the assistant attorney general of the United States, she, along with all other adult female citizens, had only had the right to vote for nine months. She was 32 years old, only five years out of law school, and had never prosecuted a single criminal case – and yet suddenly she was in charge of the thousands of Prohibition cases that began piling up in the courts, including cases against Remus.
To add to the pressure of her job, she had a serious hearing problem, and spent an hour every morning styling her hair to conceal her hearing aids. She was almost inhumanly tough and thick-skinned, qualities that were reinforced by the ice-cold bath she took every morning. Her favorite saying was: "Life has few petted darlings" – and she didn't consider herself one of them. Her formative childhood event: She once bit a pet cat's ear. To teach her a lesson, her father bit her ear back. During her time, she was the most powerful and the most famous woman in the country, and I couldn't believe she'd be so lost to history.
Your astounding research for this book made it possible for you to complete it with "no invented dialogue," thanks to government files, archives, diaries, letters, newspaper articles, books and hearing and trial transcripts, as you listed in your Author's Note. Tell me about this extraordinary investigation and why this level of accuracy of detail was so important to you.
A confession: I have never had so much fun researching a book. When I discovered that the Yale University Law Library possessed a 5,500-page trial transcript, I immediately set out for New Haven. Nearly every page was a treasure trove – all of the details I would need to recreate conversations and craft scenes. I found incredibly intimate details about Remus. For example, he didn't like to wear underwear, which in the 1920s was considered evidence of an unsound mind. It took me four months to go through the trial transcript and compose an outline, which amounted to 85,000 words – nearly as long as the finished book itself.
George Remus's wife, Imogene, fell in love with Franklin Dodge, the very Prohibition agent who put her husband in jail. Who was Imogene, and was she truly in love with Agent Dodge?
Imogene Remus was a classic villain: greedy, conniving, duplicitous – qualities for which she was roundly denigrated and punished. As awful as she was, a man who'd engaged in similar misdeeds likely would have gotten away with them. I think she was aware of this double standard and that it fueled her rebellion. She was the epitome of what the New York Times called the "middle-aged flapper," defined as one who yearns to escape from a monotonous routine and seeks independent adventures.
When Imogene met Remus, she was going through a nasty divorce, supporting herself and her young daughter by working as a "dust girl" in Remus's law office. She'd had a difficult life, and here was this brilliant, doting man who was poised to make millions as a bootlegger.
She was full partners with Remus before she turned on him, and she used all that knowledge to fortify her relationship with Dodge. Trial witnesses testified about Imogene and Dodge's flirtatious phone calls, about their afternoon rendezvous in speakeasys, and about their plans to hire a hitman to kill Remus.
I don't know if Imogene and Dodge were truly in love, but they definitely shared a common goal: to steal Remus's fortune and ruin his life.

Texto completo: Save it from the ravages of warming and we can save the planet.
MADRID -- Delegates from nearly every nation spent the last two weeks here at a United Nations climate summit struggling to chart a course to meet the extraordinarily difficult goal of net zero emissions of carbon dioxide by the year 2050.
Yet long before then, the effects of global warming could spin out of control. As the United Nations' secretary general, António Guterres, warned in opening the meeting: "The point of no return is no longer over the horizon. It is in sight and hurtling toward us."
Perhaps nowhere is that more true than in the Arctic. The surface air there is warming at twice the global rate and temperatures over the past five years have exceeded all previous records since 1900. This past week, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported that the extent of Arctic summer sea ice was at its second lowest point since satellite observations began in 1979, and that average temperatures for the year ending in September were the second highest since 1900, when record-keeping began.
What will this mean? A study published in Geophysical Research Letters in June described the catastrophic consequences of losing the Arctic's reflective summer sea ice. The ice is a great white shield that reflects incoming solar warming back to space during the long summer days of the midnight sun. Otherwise, it would be absorbed by the ocean. Losing this ice, the study explained, would be the warming equivalent of an extra 25 years of emissions at current rates, pushing us more quickly past the threshold of warming that scientists say could lead to catastrophic damage, from more intense heat waves and coastal flooding to extinctions of species and threats to food supplies.
The heating up of the Arctic is also speeding the thawing of permafrost, causing the release of more carbon dioxide and methane, a greenhouse gas 84 times more potent than carbon dioxide when measured over 20 years, along with nitrous oxide, a powerful long-lived climate pollutant.
The world needs an all-out effort to keep the Arctic ice strong. This requires cutting emissions of carbon dioxide, of course, but also attacking short-lived climate pollutants -- especially black carbon, methane and tropospheric ozone. Another one, hydrofluorocarbon refrigerants, are now being phased down under an international agreement, the Montreal Protocol.
Targeting these short-term superpollutants for aggressive reduction -- which, according to one study, could avoid twice as much warming by midcentury as aggressive reductions in carbon dioxide -- would have a pronounced effect in the Arctic, with the potential to cut the rate of warming there by up to two-thirds.
California has shown the world how to reduce these pollutants. The state has cut black carbon emissions by more than 90 percent since the 1960s, primarily by reducing diesel emissions. California has also imposed the nation's strongest standard for limiting methane emissions from landfills and strict regulations on refrigerants in air-conditioners and consumer products.
Other countries can build on California's success by including plans to reduce these short-lived climate pollutants in updates to their national commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, due next year under the Paris climate agreement.
The race to maintain the Arctic's stabilizing role in the global climate means, in addition, that we need to put geoengineering into the policy mix, despite its hazards, moral or otherwise. This should start with "soft" geoengineering that can be carefully monitored as it is scaling up, and reversed if side effects become too troubling.
One example, developed by the nonprofit group Ice911, would be to cover thin, first-year ice with a type of white sand to enhance the reflectivity of the sun's radiation and allow the ice to grow stronger. We should start field-testing this strategy immediately.
A riskier approach would be to introduce sulfates or other particles into the atmosphere to reflect solar radiation, mimicking the temperature-reducing effect of volcanic eruptions. We don't know enough yet to employ this idea.
But we've reached the point where we need to understand whether it would be effective, while developing a strong governance system to manage it. The risk of losing the Arctic's stabilizing function for the global climate now appears far greater than the risk of experimenting with geoengineering.

Texto completo: The consulting company chases after government contracts, but it has a habit of evading the oversight that comes with them.
This article is copublished with ProPublica , the nonprofit investigative newsroom.
It's not easy being McKinsey & Company these days.
For most of its 90-odd-year existence, the prestigious management consultancy prided itself on remaining above the fray. McKinsey consultants plied the executive suites of Fortune 500 companies, counseling chief executives with discretion and quietly building a business that, with $ 10 billion in annual revenues, is now bigger than many of the entities it serves. The substance of the company's work, and even the identities of its clients, lie concealed under an institutional code of silence. That reticence, enforced by a nondisclosure agreement, bedeviled Pete Buttigieg's presidential campaign until last Monday, when McKinsey granted him a rare dispensation to reveal the names of his former clients.
On the occasions when McKinsey's work has been scrutinized of late, it hasn't reflected well on the firm. Reporting by The New York Times, ProPublica and others over the past 18 months has raised serious questions about how it does business at home and abroad: corruption allegations against companies McKinsey partnered with in South Africa and Mongolia; a federal criminal investigation into the firm's bankruptcy practice in the United States; attempts to deny that it helped put into effect controversial Trump administration immigration policies; and evidence that McKinsey cherry-picked nonviolent inmates for a pilot project and made it seem that an attempt to curb violence at New York City's Rikers Island jail complex was working (it wasn't). McKinsey has denied wrongdoing in each of these instances.
These and other examples of McKinsey's recent conduct reveal a common dynamic. An examination of these episodes, including thousands of pages of documents and interviews with dozens of current and former McKinsey consultants and clients from multiple projects, suggests McKinsey behaves as if it believes the rules should bend to its way of doing things, not the other way around.
McKinsey's self-regard has long been uncommonly high. In the firm's 2010 internal history, a copy of which ProPublica obtained, partners compare the firm to the Marine Corps, the Roman Catholic Church, and the Jesuits: "analytically rigorous, deeply principled seekers of knowledge and truth," the history's authors write. One McKinsey partner went a step further, declaring without a hint of irony that the firm's trait of shared values is more than "even the Catholic Church can promise."
This attitude works for the firm in corporate consulting, an unregulated field where McKinsey's reputation leaves it largely free to do things its own way and where its insistence on not being publicly credited has also shielded it from blame for its failures. But as McKinsey has expanded its consulting empire in recent years, it has taken on a growing book of work for government entities, as well as for corporate clients in areas subject to government oversight, such as advising bankrupt companies on restructuring.
In that field, consulting firms confront a web of contracting, disclosure and ethics rules that are designed to dictate and limit their behavior. These rules exist to prevent governments from wasting taxpayer money on underqualified or overpriced contractors and to protect government integrity and avoid conflicts of interests. In recent years, as McKinsey has burrowed deeper into this world, interviews and records show, it has developed a habit of disregarding inconvenient rules and norms to secure, retain and profit from government work.
Consider McKinsey's imbroglios in South Africa and Mongolia. The firm did not follow the due diligence protocols commonly deployed to avoid running afoul of anti-corruption laws. The result: Its consultants found themselves working alongside dubious local companies that got them entangled in corruption investigations. Only after McKinsey became embroiled in the South Africa corruption scandal did the firm decide it needed to put more stringent safeguards in place.
In the United States, a damning but largely overlooked report issued in July by the Office of Inspector General for the General Services Administration, the hub for federal contracting, depicted McKinsey as ignoring rules and refusing to take no for an answer. The report examined McKinsey's attempts to renew a major long-running contract in 2016. The firm was asked to provide additional pricing information to satisfy federal contracting rules. Rather than comply, McKinsey went over the contracting officer's head, lodging complaints with top G.S.A. officials, who refused to exempt the firm from the rules.
Eventually, the firm found a friendly G.S.A. manager who was willing to not only award the contract, but also manipulated the G.S.A.'s pricing tools to increase the value of the contract by tens of millions of dollars. The report concluded the manager "violated requirements governing ethical conduct."
The pattern repeated itself when McKinsey failed in multiple attempts to win a separate contract around the same time. Stymied, according to the report, McKinsey browbeat the contracting officer, threatening to resubmit the proposal until it got its way. The G.S.A. manager again intervened -- for reasons left unexplained by the report -- and McKinsey got its contract.
The report's assessment of McKinsey's behavior was withering, and it revealed that the firm subsequently used the same friendly manager to help secure contracts at three other federal agencies in 2017 and 2018. "Multiple contracting officers," the inspector general wrote, told investigators that McKinsey's requests were "inappropriate" and "a conflict of interest."
The report recommended that the G.S.A. cancel the contracts, which as of earlier this year had earned McKinsey nearly $ 1 billion over a 13-year span. In a response to the report, the G.S.A. stated that it would ask McKinsey to renegotiate the contracts to lower the price. "If McKinsey declines" or "renegotiations do not yield a result in the government's best interest," the agency wrote, it would cancel them. Neither has happened to date, according to federal contracting records. A McKinsey spokesman said: "We have reviewed the report and the relevant facts, and have found no evidence of any improper conduct by our firm. We are in negotiations with G.S.A. and look forward to completing them soon." A G.S.A. spokesperson said it is negotiating for "better pricing" and will not award McKinsey any further work under the contracts until those negotiations are concluded.
McKinsey has also taken steps to evade public accountability. As ProPublica reported, a senior partner leading McKinsey's work at Rikers asked top corrections officials and members of the consulting team to restrict their communications to Wickr, an encrypted messaging app that deletes messages automatically after a few hours or days. That insulated some of McKinsey's work from government oversight and public records requests. ("Our policies require colleagues to adhere to all relevant laws and regulations," a McKinsey spokesman said. He neither confirmed nor denied the use of Wickr.)
Speaking more broadly, the McKinsey spokesman said: "We hear the calls for change. We are working hard to address the issues that have been raised."
McKinsey has so far escaped serious repercussions for its reluctance to follow inconvenient rules. That could change next year.
Consultancies such as McKinsey, which advise companies restructuring under bankruptcy protection, are required to disclose potential conflicts of interest. For the past few years, McKinsey has been locked in a complicated set of court disputes with Jay Alix, the founder of a competing advisory firm, and with the Justice Department's bankruptcy watchdog over whether McKinsey failed to follow bankruptcy disclosure rules, a subject The Times has covered in depth.
McKinsey has, since then, disclosed a number of new potential conflicts in old bankruptcy cases and paid $ 32.5 million to creditors and the United States trustee to settle claims over insufficient disclosures. The trustee has said that "McKinsey failed to satisfy its obligations under bankruptcy law and demonstrated a lack of candor." The firm denies wrongdoing and says it settled "in order to move forward and focus on serving its clients."
Subsequently, McKinsey has moved, in effect, to rewrite the rules. It drafted a protocol ostensibly meant to clarify what advisers like itself need to disclose. Critics pointed out that McKinsey's protocol allows such firms to avoid disclosing relationships they deem indirect or "de minimis."
There remains more to come. Apart from the criminal investigation, a judge in Houston has scheduled a trial in February to decide the merits of Mr. Alix's allegations. The judge, David R. Jones, has described the trial in apocalyptic tones. It will be, Judge Jones has said, "the ultimate career ender for somebody." For McKinsey, a trial would mean being called on to defend its work in public -- with real accountability and real consequences for its actions. The firm might even benefit in the long run from the sunlight.

Texto completo: The freshman Democrat, who represents a New Jersey district where President Trump is popular, told aides he would announce his switch next week.
Dec. 16, 2019
WASHINGTON -- Representative Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey, a moderate Democrat who is among his party's staunchest opponents of impeaching President Trump, told aides on Saturday that he is planning to switch parties and declare himself a Republican as soon as next week, just as the House is casting its historic votes on articles of impeachment.
At a White House meeting on Friday, Mr. Van Drew sought Mr. Trump's blessing for the move, which could be critical to his ability to avoid a primary challenge next year, and the president urged him to make the jump, according to two Democrats and one Republican who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the talks were intended to be private.
Mr. Van Drew has spoken with senior advisers to Mr. Trump about announcing his switch at an event at the White House either immediately before or just after the House votes on two articles of impeachment, which is expected to happen on Wednesday, according to Republicans and Democrats.
Beyond the potential boost to Mr. Van Drew's own political fortunes, the move would also provide a silver lining for Mr. Trump as he becomes the third president ever to be impeached. The president has characterized the drive to remove him as an entirely partisan exercise that will cost Democrats their majority in the House, and a high-profile Democratic defection could help bolster his case while allowing him to divert attention from the vote.
The decision by Mr. Van Drew reflects the heavy political consequences hanging over next week's impeachment vote, particularly for moderate Democrats in districts that supported Mr. Trump in 2016. While there is little doubt that Democrats will have the votes to approve the charges against the president in a near party-line vote, a small number of their conservative-leaning members are deeply uncomfortable with the idea of taking part in a Democrat-only impeachment vote and are spending the weekend torn over how to proceed.
Mr. Van Drew did not respond to a request for comment.
Last month, Mr. Van Drew vowed in a two-hour teleconference that he would remain a Democrat.
"I am absolutely not changing," he said, stating his lifelong position as a moderate Democrat.
But conversations between Mr. Van Drew and top advisers to Mr. Trump intensified in recent days, according to a Republican familiar with the discussions, with the lawmaker making clear that he was nervous about losing his seat, either in a Democratic primary or the general election.
Those talks came after Mr. Van Drew saw the results of a poll conducted this month that suggested that a vote against impeaching Mr. Trump would damage his chances of winning his Democratic primary. The poll, a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times, showed that the overwhelming majority of Democratic primary voters -- 71 percent -- would be less likely to support his re-election if he opposed the charges against Mr. Trump.
A freshman lawmaker from a historically Republican-leaning southern New Jersey district, Mr. Van Drew has already made clear he will not support impeachment, which has prompted talk of a liberal primary challenger.
"I don't see anything there worthy of actually taking a president out of office," he said earlier in the week.
Mr. Van Drew was one of only two House Democrats who opposed the impeachment process when the party's leaders brought the matter to a vote in October to lay out ground rules for the inquiry. That stance has made him the target of sharp criticism from progressive activists and protests outside his district office. Perhaps more notable, his state's machine-aligned Democratic leaders have also gone public with their own discomfort over his stance.
"I am imploring you to vote in favor of impeachment," Michael Suleiman, the Atlantic County Democratic chairman, wrote in a letter to Mr. Van Drew, warning about repercussions for other Democrats. "A 'no' vote on impeachment will suppress Democratic turnout down-ballot, which my organization cannot sustain," he continued.
A former state senator, Mr. Van Drew represents a congressional district the president won by about 5 points in 2016. Mr. Van Drew won the seat more easily thanks to a Republican opponent who made racist comments and lost his backing from the national party.
But congressional Republicans were already focusing on Mr. Van Drew, considering him a top target in their effort to take back the House.
Mr. Van Drew kept his discussions about leaving the Democratic Party closely guarded. On Saturday afternoon, as word circulated about his switch, his re-election campaign emailed a fund-raising invitation for an event next month in New Jersey to benefit him and his fellow freshman Democrats in the state's delegation.
"These frontline members are facing incredibly difficult re-election campaigns and are a critical piece of the puzzle as we work to protect our majority in the House," the invitation said.
Mr. Van Drew may already have Democratic challenger. Brigid Harrison, a politics professor at Montclair State University, had been publicly signaling that she was considering a primary challenge to Mr. Van Drew. Already, she has met with many of the county Democratic leaders in the district, as well as Stephen M. Sweeney, the powerful State Senate president.
Now, she says an announcement about her candidacy as a Democrat is imminent.
"At the end of the day, whether you're a Democrat or a Republican or an independent, what you don't like is a traitor," Ms. Harrison said in an interview. "So now, in addition to prioritizing his political career over the direction of the country, Congressman Van Drew is also a traitor to his voters."
Mr. Van Drew has long had a difficult relationship with many Democrats in his home state, based in part on his support for gun rights. But during his years in the state legislature, he was an important Democratic vote for the southern block of the state, so he was largely spared from intraparty threats.
Still, once he was elected to Congress, Mr. Van Drew began to stray more visibly from the state delegation. He skipped a delegation meeting in Washington with Gov. Philip D. Murphy, the lone lawmaker from New Jersey's 13 Democratic representatives and senators to do so.
And since he has been publicly indicating he will not vote for impeachment, party leaders in New Jersey have intensified their opposition. Mr. Van Drew had reportedly sought a letter of support from Democratic county leaders to help prop him up after his impeachment vote, but was denied.
Instead, Mr. Suleiman, the powerful Atlantic County chairman, sent the stern letter to Mr. Van Drew.
"Atlantic County Democrats have a tough time as it is facing 100 years of 'Boardwalk Empire;' we cannot afford to have Democrats sit on their hands in a presidential year when we usually perform well," he wrote in a letter first obtained by The New Jersey Globe.
The drop-off in support from party leaders also comes after Mr. Van Drew failed to deliver legislative victories in his district last month. A slate that was publicly called "Team Van Drew" lost all three of its legislative seats, one of the few blue-to-red flips in the New Jersey off-year elections.
Mr. Van Drew would hardly be the first political moderate to change parties before what could be a difficult election. In December 2009, then-Representative Parker Griffith of Alabama, a freshman who was elected as a Democrat, became a Republican. But Mr. Griffith, with no Republican president in office to vouch for him, lost his primary the next year.

An Even More Traumatic Public Bathroom
My 50-person team got relocated to a new floor in our building, and the bathroom situation is curiously abysmal. There are two, one labeled "male," the other "female." In each room, there are two toilets with no dividers whatsoever. Rumor has it H.R. has ordered fabric curtains to separate them. I trust all of my co-workers, but I don't think curtains could ever provide sufficient privacy or security for people to feel comfortable using the restroom. Lots of us are upset and plan to use bathroom facilities on other floors of our building. Are we justified in feeling this way? Is having curtains to divide bathroom stalls even legal?
-- New York
I'm not authorized to practice bathroom law on land, but the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's sanitation regulations appear to indicate that a workplace of 50 employees is required to maintain at least three "water closets" (cute), each consisting of "a separate compartment with a door and walls or partitions between fixtures sufficiently high to assure privacy." It seems to me that even if H.R. hung truly luxurious curtains, multitoilet restrooms without lockable stalls could count only as single-use facilities, which would place two on your floor. (Of course there's no point in gendering single-use facilities, especially with adjectives as oddly scientific as "male" and "female." It seems to me that whoever made those labels panicked and forgot what bathroom signs typically say.)
But! If your company provides "unobstructed free access" to other toilets -- imagining, in this scenario, that it operates on multiple floors, not that employees have propped open a fire escape to facilitate backdoor bathroom access to the offices of corporate neighbors -- this unholy circumstance may violate the laws of good taste while just barely complying with those of New York State. In 1976, an OSHA director wrote that a restroom facility in a separate building 90 feet from the building where employees worked was in compliance. (Why are social rules upended for men at urinals? Nice try -- I can't be tricked into pondering a gentleman's thought process.) My advice: Familiarize yourself with OSHA's complaint guidelines and see if any of the options appeal to you -- but also seriously consider finding a new job. A love seat bathroom setup does not suggest a business with a bright financial future, or tremendous concern for its employees.
Editors to the Letter
I am periodically asked to write letters of recommendation for former students or colleagues. I'm generally happy to do this and pleased if they offer some direction about skills or experience they want me to emphasize. Often they ask to proofread the letter, and I'm fine with them correcting a typo or asking me to tighten up sentence structure.
Increasingly, however, the critiques of my draft letter include requests for specific phrases. I'm not sure how to say, "Sorry, Mo, but I don't actually think you have leadership skills." How can I politely convey that I will only provide the letter if it's in my own words?
-- Pittsburgh
Even if you don't believe a hijacking attempt demonstrates leadership skills, your students' and colleagues' efforts to forcibly steer your recommendations in the direction of their choosing are, at the very least, indicative of proactive styles of problem-solving.
That being said, someone who needs to borrow $ 50 doesn't get to choose the bills. I'm slightly concerned that applicants ask to proofread your letters "often." This is either a sign that you lack basic letter-writing skills (which could explain why the only people who solicit your endorsement are immoral ne'er-do-wells with no flair for leadership) or a trick to ensure applicants can collaborate with you on their own compliments. Assuming your email to Work Friend is indicative of your usual style (and was not proofread by someone seeking your recommendation), you are a neat and clear writer whose prose does not call out for extensive rewrites. Either problem can be solved with the same solution: asking a reasonably intelligent acquaintance to give your letters a quick once-over.
Of course, it's ideal if your letter features airtight sentence structure and suggests to recipients that its subject has earned the admiration of someone with a sound knowledge of modern grammar and spelling conventions. I once asked an authority figure for a letter of recommendation that -- when received one day before the application deadline -- contained so many errors, I feared submitting it would call into question my own judgment. So I did what any considerate, rational person would do: burst into the office of someone else at the same institution, begged them to write me a letter with no notice, apologized profusely for not having asked them in the first place and swore them to absolute secrecy, thereby preserving the dignity of the original letter writer, and dusting intrigue like powdered sugar over everyone's plain lives.
When someone asks you to write a letter of recommendation, that person is seeking your approval. Accept only thanks. (Not edits.)
Retiring Vicariously
I'm retiring. I'm surprised how consistently I'm asked what I'm going to do. Any suggestions? After I organize my house, go through my reading list and get a good gym regimen, what's next? What does successful retirement look like?
-- Portland, Ore.
I recently encountered a man who was retired and taking a scenic train ride through the American Southwest. At the time, his retirement was very fresh -- so fresh he could still revel in its novelty among strangers. He confided to me that his new workless life had required "a short period of adjustment -- about 10 minutes!" That's a perfect joke, and he delivered it flawlessly. Practicing this joke so you can incorporate it into your repertoire will eat up a couple of minutes of your abundant free time.
Your retirement will be successful by virtue of the fact it will take place -- a circumstance neither I nor my friends (an ironic term referring to my enemies in competition for the Earth's dwindling resources) will ever experience. People who ask about your plans for the chapter of your life when every day will be Saturday afternoon are not looking for a reasonable reply. They are dim-eyed soldiers who, their lower limbs having just been blown apart by German artillery, are posing to you the blood-choked, hopeless question: "What will happen to me now?"
The appropriate response (accompanied by a smile): "A scenic train ride through the American Southwest."

Texto completo: As the largest protests in weeks rocked Hong Kong last Sunday, with hundreds of thousands filling downtown streets, I was struck by the simple statement from Alice Wong, 24, a biology researcher, a protester among the many in the city’s Victoria Park: “We don’t want to become like China.”
That’s it. Well, she also told a New York Times reporter the obvious intertwined truth in what the mostly young constant demonstrators are after: “We want Hong Kong to continue being Hong Kong.”
That is, she wants her city-state, the former British colony, to continue being culturally Chinese in the broader sense of the diaspora, in the way that Singapore is Chinese — but not; that vast parts of Kuala Lumpur are Chinese — but not; that, well, Arcadia is Chinese — but not.
A heritage, common tongues, an entrepreneurial bent — but without the snooping authoritarian leadership with which the Communist Party has merely replaced the ancient Chinese landlord class in a political system that is anything but communal.
If the plutocrats in Beijing were smart about it, were able to let go of their manic goal of roping all the billions of Chinese peoples in the world into one system, they would realize letting Hong Kong be Hong Kong — letting Taiwan be Taiwan, for that matter — would be by far the best thing for the Mainland as well. That way they don’t have to move toward systems like those in HK and Taipei and Singapore that are mildly democratic, with a few more civil liberties. They can let the broader Chinese nation let off a little steam of freedom without becoming more open themselves.
Instead, the People’s Republic has to control all things in the territories of its growing empire, even if that means putting a million Uighur Muslims in concentration camps.
I wish I could say that it was remotely possible to foresee a successful end game in the Hong Kong kids’ mass marches. But I can’t. As there’s something in a scorpion’s nature that leads it to sting, there’s something in Beijing’s emperors that won’t broach dissent. Sooner or later they’ll send in the People’s Army to put down the actual people.
But it’s not just Chinese people Beijing wants to control. It’s the rest of us, too.
Pasadena lawyer Rob O’Brien, President Trump’s new national security advisor, came back to town last week to speak at a defense forum.
Outside it, he gave an interview to NPR from which I was very happy to find he’s leading the administration’s anti-China world domination wing by detailing the dangers of other nations allowing the Chinese telecommunications company Huawei to build the internet’s new 5G networks:
“So every medical record, every social media post, every email, every financial transaction, and every citizen of the country with cloud computing and artificial intelligence can be sucked up out of Huawei into massive servers in China,” O’Brien told NPR.
Inside the meeting, he kept up the theme, telling defense industry and military officials: “This isn’t a theoretical threat.”
It’s not. And, as if in some over-the-top parody of international bad guys, China’s leaders are coming after your kids, too. TikTok, that latest fad you don’t understand, is the most-downloaded app this year, featuring 15-second videos mostly shared by young people. Here’s how Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Missouri, puts it: “A company compromised by the Chinese Communist Party knows where your children are, knows what they look like, what their voices sound like, what they’re watching and what they share with each other.” If that sounds like a real-life “The Man in the High Castle” world, then I suggest we join the HK kids, and protest.

Even As Humans Send Probes Deep Into Space, An Interstellar Comet Visits In Time For Holidays

Texto completo: It came out of the northern sky, a frozen breath of gas and dust from the genesis of some distant star, launched across the galaxy by the gravitational maelstroms that accompany the birth of worlds.
It wandered in the deep freeze of interstellar space for 100 million years or so, a locked vault of cosmo-chemical history. In spring 2019, this ice cube began falling into our own solar system. Feeble heat from the sun, still distant, loosened carbon monoxide from its surface into a faint, glowing fog; the orphan ice cube became a new comet.
Six months later, Gennady Borisov, a Crimean astronomer, saw it drifting in front of the constellation Cancer and sounded the alarm.
On Sunday, the comet that now bears his name - 2I Borisov - made a wide turn around the sun and began heading back out of the solar system. As it departs, it will steadily brighten and grow in size as sunlight continues to shake off the dust from a long, cold sleep. On Dec. 28, the comet will pass 180 million miles from Earth, its closest approach to our planet.
This procession is being greeted with hungry eyes by a species only just knocking on the door of interstellar exploration and eager for news from out there.
Humanity’s most distant artifacts, the two Voyager spacecraft, recently punched through the magnetic bubble that closes off the solar system from the rest of the galaxy. Meanwhile, a band of scientists and engineers are developing an extravagantly ambitious plan, called Breakthrough Starshot, to launch a fleet of butterfly-size probes all the way to Alpha Centauri, the nearest star system to our own.
But what’s Out There is already In Here. Nature, generous as ever, has been slinging “Scientific CARE packages,” as Gregory Laughlin, a Yale astronomer, put it, toward us in the form of interstellar comets.
Two years ago, astronomers discovered an interstellar rock called Oumuamua cruising through the solar system. It caused a sensation, exciting talk of alien probes until further study concluded that it was actually a comet with no tail - albeit a comet from reaches unknown. Now 2I Borisov has astronomers tingling again, ready to follow its outbound run with their telescopes.
“I think the sense of excitement stems in part from the timing of these discoveries,” Laughlin said. Oumuamua and Borisov, he added, augur well for a new telescope the National Science Foundation is building in Chile called the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, which will sweep the entire sky every few days, producing in effect a movie of the universe.
That telescope will be superbly positioned to find more interloper comets, perhaps even in time to send probes to greet them with “Deep Impact”-style missions. “The situation is reminiscent of when the first exoplanets were detected,” Laughlin said.
So far, the two examples of interstellar comets that humans have observed could not be more different. Oumuamua was mistaken for an asteroid at first because it had no cometary cloud of gas and dust around it, at least that could be seen. But as it was traveling out of sight, small perturbations in its motion suggested that in fact the rock was actually a comet, being pushed around by jets of gas shooting from its surface.
Estimates of the object’s shape - long and cigarlike - spurred speculation that it could be an alien probe or even a solar sail. Recent analysis by Sergey Mashchenko, an astrophysicist at McMaster University in Ontario, has concluded that Oumuamua was less a rod than a thin slab rocking back and forth as sunlight and radiation wore it away.
“It was vanishing as it went away, like a bar of soap in the shower,” Laughlin said.
Borisov’s comet underwent an astronomical rite of passage of sorts in October, when the Hubble Space Telescope got a good look at it: a white knuckle at the head of a bluish fan of light.
Subsequent observations by telescopes on Earth have confirmed the presence of alien water and carbon monoxide as well as a growing list of chemicals from another part of the universe. As of Nov. 24, the comet’s tail had grown to 100,000 miles long. The comet’s nucleus is only a mile across.
Early in November, the Gemini observatory spotted the wanderer passing about 1 billion light-years in front of a spiral galaxy “romantically known” as 2dFgrS TGN363Z174, said Travis Rector, an astronomer from the University of Alaska Anchorage who was involved in taking the photograph. As if to tease us humans with a reminder of places unknown and unvisitable, the backdrop to the portrait is speckled with faint smudges of even more distant galaxies and stars.
When December began, 2I Borisov was drifting through the constellation Crater. Its brightness in astronomical terms was magnitude 16, far too faint for the naked eye or even binoculars, but accessible to a modest telescope and a CCD camera. (You can track it in real time at SkyLive.)
The comet is expected reach a peak brightness of about magnitude 15 around Friday, plus or minus a week, according to Quanzhi Ye, an astronomer at the University of Maryland and another in the network of observers following the comet.
The comet came from the general direction of Cassiopeia and will exit the solar system through the southern constellation Telescopium, Ye said.
But this is only the beginning of comet-tracking season, he added. Astronomers will be following Borisov through at least the end of next year. Anything could happen on this watch. As comets approach the sun, geysers of vaporized ice, gas and dust can spring forth. Subsurface gas can heat up and explode, ejecting huge plumes of dust, which would make the comet much brighter and more visible.
“Solar system comets often (but not always) display outbursts near perihelion,” Laughlin said in a recent email. “But so far Borisov has been ‘boring’ in this regard.”

Texto completo: OLIVESBURG, OHIO – For Sam Donohue, philanthropy started early.
The son of Crestview graduates Sean and Molly Donohue, the 5-year-old came up with the idea to have a drive for socks for needy children.
His idea blew up more than his parents could have imagined. The drive led to the donation of 619 pairs of socks, 80 hats and 121 pairs of gloves. People also contributed three earmuffs, three headbands, a pair of shoes, a fleece jacket and a scarf.
"It kind of spread, which was really awesome," Molly Donohue said. "It got exciting for us as parents."
The idea came from the children's book "What Do You Do with an Idea," a New York Times bestseller.
"You change the world," Donohue said. "It's kind of a lot for a 5-year-old. We tried to make it make more sense to him.
"We could help other people. Socks and warm things are not something everybody has. It started very small."
It grew very big.
Donohue's mother, Joyce Brennan, shared the idea with her garden club.
"They did a huge collection," Donohue said.
A neighbor – the Donohues live in Akron – donated 200 pairs of socks. Sean Donohue mentioned the drive at his workplace.
Because of the huge haul, the Donohues divided the donations between Crestview and Akron City Schools, where Sam is in preschool.
"It was all going to be for Crestview," Molly Donohue said. "I wanted to give back. Our roots go back to Crestview."
Molly graduated in 1999, while her husband graduated in 1998.
She and Sam took the items to Crestview Elementary School early last week, coordinating with school counselor Taylor White.
"We have a lot of students that come in without gloves or hats," she said.
White gave socks to a boy whose family had recently moved. She said she was impressed with Sam's initiative.
"It was very unexpected that a 5-year-old had the idea," White said. "It was very much appreciated."
Donohue also has a niece who is in the first grade at Crestview.
One of the family's neighbors bought the book "What Do You Do with an Idea?" for Sam and asked him to pick another child he thought would have good ideas to change the world.
"Pretty cool," Donohue said.
According to amazon.com, "What Do You Do With an Idea?" is for anyone who's ever had a big idea.
It's the story of one brilliant idea and the child who helps to bring it into the world. As the child's confidence grows, so does the idea itself. And then, one day, something amazing happens.
Amazon.com says it is a story for anyone, at any age, who's ever had an idea that seemed a little too big, too odd, too difficult. It's a story to inspire you to welcome that idea, to give it some space to grow and to see what happens next. Because your idea isn't going anywhere. In fact, it's just getting started.
Donohue said she and her husband try to give back, noting the Ronald McDonald House is one of their favorite charities.
She is challenging News Journal readers to keep the idea going on their own. She wants the same for Sam.
"I'm hoping that this continues his whole life," Donohue said.
Sam Donohue, 5, started a sock drive for needy kids that ended up with nearly 600 donated pairs.

Impeachment heads to full House; Judiciary panel's Democrats prevail to advance the case against Trump

Texto completo: The House Judiciary Committee approved two articles of impeachment against President Trump on Friday, setting up a vote by the full chamber next week that is likely to make him the third U.S. president to be impeached.
The articles -- accusing Trump of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress -- relate to his attempt to have Ukraine investigate his political enemies while he was withholding nearly $400 million in military aid to the country, a scheme Democrats described as an invitation for a foreign power to meddle in a U.S. election.
"Today is a solemn and sad day," Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) said in brief comments to reporters after the votes.

Nadler surprised Republicans late Thursday night by concluding the hearing after 14 hours of withering debate, delaying the vote until Friday morning to defang a potential GOP claim that the Democrats were voting in the dark of night when most Americans weren't watching.
He urged members to "to search their consciences" before making their decision, but the votes on both counts broke along party lines as expected -- all 23 Democrats voted yes and all 17 Republicans voted no.
Republicans told reporters after the votes that Democrats would pay a political price for what they called a blind pursuit of the president rooted in frustration that he won the 2016 presidential election.
"They predetermined they were going to do it, and they did it," said Rep. Debbie Lesko (R-Ariz.). "They had no proof, no evidence, no crime. But they went ahead anyway, and they're tearing the country apart. And they should be ashamed."
The Democratic-controlled House is expected to consider "H. Res. 755, Impeaching Donald John Trump, President of the United States, for high crimes and misdemeanors" on Wednesday or Thursday of next week, with the impeachment expected to pass nearly along party lines.
The abuse of power article relates to the pressure campaign on Ukraine. The obstruction of Congress article relates to Trump's refusal to cooperate with the impeachment investigation and his blocking federal employees and agencies from providing Congress with testimony or documents.
Passage would set up a trial in the Republican-controlled Senate in January, which is all but certain to acquit the president and leave him in office.
"This desperate charade of an impeachment inquiry in the House Judiciary Committee has reached its shameful end," White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham said in a statement. "The president looks forward to receiving in the Senate the fair treatment and due process which continues to be disgracefully denied to him by the House."
There have been disagreements among Republicans about how to handle the trial, and some of Trump's fiercest allies want a drawn-out process with witnesses.
"I understand their desire to just get it behind us. But the country needs to hear what a farce this was," said Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-Texas).
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has sent signals that he would prefer a short trial, but said Thursday night that he would work with the White House to design the rules for the trial.
"I'm going to take my cues from the president's lawyers," he told Fox News.
Trump insisted to reporters in the Oval Office on Friday that he didn't care about the length of the trial.
"We did nothing wrong," he said. "So I'll do long, or short."
Rudolph W. Giuliani, the president's lawyer, who arrived at the White House shortly before Friday's vote, sent a text message saying that "either way it's bull."
McConnell's comments about coordinating with Trump's lawyers outraged Democrats, who accused him of abandoning his duty to conduct a fair process.
"If Sen. McConnell is saying there's no chance that there's a conviction and he's coordinating with the White House, he essentially has surrendered the constitutional mandate that the Senate conduct a trial," said Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.).
After weeks of investigations, public hearings and nightly sniping on cable news, the final marathon session in the Judiciary Committee featured the most direct confrontation yet between members of Congress over whether Trump's actions merit impeachment and removal from office.
In Thursday's 14-hour session, called a markup, Republicans floated amendments to eliminate or water down the impeachment articles, forcing lengthy debates on sometimes unrelated topics that inevitably ended with Democrats swatting down the proposals.
With no witnesses to question and little chance of substantive changes, the markup session -- which began Wednesday night and spread over three days -- rambled across topics from what the Founding Fathers would have wanted to whether President Clinton's impeachment should have happened.
"No matter what they threw at the wall, no matter what spaghetti they were throwing at the wall, it wasn't sticking because it's not real," Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) said of Republican attempts to derail the process. "And so I think we just have to continue to bring it back to the facts."
Democrats maintained that they were reluctant to impeach Trump, but argued that Congress serves as the last line of defense against a presidency that they say has veered out of control.
"This is a moment of personal conscience," said Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee (D-Texas). "This is a moment where we had to hold the president accountable."
Republicans said it was Democrats, not the president, who overstepped their authority in their push for impeachment. They said the case against Trump was the product not of careful investigation, but intense hatred of the president and his supporters.
Democrats' case against Trump focuses on his push for Ukraine to launch investigations that would help him politically. He pressed Ukraine to announce an investigation of Joe Biden, his son Hunter and Burisma, the Ukrainian gas company on whose board Hunter Biden sat. The former vice president could be Trump's Democratic opponent in next year's election.
Trump also wanted Ukraine to investigate a debunked conspiracy theory involving the Eastern European country and the hacking of Democratic Party emails in 2016, an operation that was carried out by Russia.
According to the articles of impeachment, Trump "betrayed the nation by abusing his high office to enlist a foreign power in corrupting democratic elections," and "abused the powers of his high office" by directing administration officials to defy congressional subpoenas.
Republicans have repeatedly pointed out that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said publicly he wasn't pressured by Trump. But Nadler noted Ukraine, which relies on U.S. military aid and support in its war with Russian-backed separatists, may by reluctant to openly challenge Trump's version on events.
Democrats also say the act of asking a foreign government to get involved in a U.S. election is an abuse of power regardless of whether that government's leader is willing to say that he felt under pressure.

Texto completo: Headnote Recordings reveal slights facing Blacks
Jimmy Kennedy earned $13 million during his nine-year career as a player in the National Football League. He was the kind of person most banks would be happy to have as a client.
But when Kennedy tried to become a "private client" at JPMorgan Chase, an elite designation that would earn him travel discounts, exclusive event invitations and better deals on loans, he kept getting the runaround.
At first, he did not understand why. Then, last fall, he showed up at his local JPMorgan branch in Arizona, and an employee offered an explanation.
"You're bigger than the average person, period. And you're also an African American," the employee, Charles Belton, who is Black, told Kennedy. "We're in Arizona. I don't have to tell you about what the demographics are in Arizona. They don't see people like you a lot."
Kennedy recorded the conversation and shared it with The New York Times.
It is no secret that racism has been baked into the American banking system. There are few Black executives in the upper echelons of most financial institutions. Leading banks have recently paid restitution to Black employees for isolating them from white peers, placing them in the poorest branches and cutting them off from career opportunities. Black customers are sometimes profiled, viewed with suspicion just for entering a bank and questioned over the most basic transactions.
This year, researchers for the National Bureau of Economic Research found that Black mortgage borrowers were charged higher interest rates than white borrowers and were denied mortgages that would have been approved for white applicants.
Banks, including JPMorgan, say they are committed to eradicating the legacy of racism. And they insist that any lingering side effects simply reflect stubborn socioeconomic imbalances in society as a whole, not racial bias among their employees.
What recently transpired inside a cluster of JPMorgan branches in the Phoenix area suggests that is not true.
Kennedy was told he was essentially too Black. His financial adviser, Ricardo Peters, complained that he, too, was a victim of racial discrimination. What makes their cases extraordinary is not that the two men say they faced discrimination.
It is that they recorded their interactions with bank employees, preserving a record of what white executives otherwise might have dismissed as figments of the aggrieved parties' imaginations.
Patricia Wexler, a JPMorgan spokeswoman, defended the bank's overall treatment of Peters and Kennedy. She said that the bank had not been aware of all of the audio recordings and that "in light of some new information brought to us by The New York Times," the company put one of its executive directors on administrative leave while the bank investigates his conduct.
The back of the branch
Peters started his career at JPMorgan as a salesman in the bank's credit cards division. After about eight years in various roles, he was promoted to a financial adviser position in Phoenix in 2016. His job was to help bank customers prudently invest their money.
Peters had won numerous performance awards at the bank, but things soon started going wrong for him.
He was working in a JPMorgan branch in the affluent Sun City West area of Phoenix. He sought a promotion to become a private client adviser, a job that would have let him work with wealthier and more lucrative clients.
The promotion never came. Instead, Peters was moved out of an office at the heart of the branch where he worked with other financial advisers and was relegated to a windowless room in the back.
In April 2017, one of his bosses, Frank Venniro, told Peters that another manager had accused him of taking customers' files home at night, a violation of the bank's code of conduct. Peters denied it, and Venniro accepted that he was telling the truth, according to a recording of the conversation. But, he added, Peters needed to be more cognizant of how his colleagues perceived him.
Peters was left with the impression that his managers, who were white, were predisposed to view him suspiciously. Could he prove it? No
What happened next was clearer.
Peters complained to Venniro that another financial adviser was trying to steal a prospective client: a woman who had just received a $372,000 wrongful death settlement after her son died. She was Black.
Venniro told Peters that there was no point in his intervening in the dispute, because the woman was not a worthwhile client.
"You've got somebody who's coming from Section 8, never had a nickel to spend, and now she's got $400,000," Venniro said, referring to the federal program that provides vouchers to help with housing costs and whose title is sometimes used as a racial slur. "What do you think's going to happen with that money? It's gons."
"But I thought that's why we get involved," Peters protested.
Venniro said no, as he knew from experience that she would quickly burn through the money.
"You're not investing a dime for this lady," he said. "It happens every single time."
When Peters tried to argue, Vennino interjected.
"This is not money she respects," he said. "She didn't earn it."
Venniro declined to comment.
Wexler, the bank spokeswoman, said that Venniro was put on leave after inquiries from The Times and that he resigned Dec. 5.
"Our employee used extraordinarily bad judgment and was wrong to suggest we couldn't help a customer," she said, acknowledging that Venniro knew the client was in subsidized housing but did not know her race.
Marching orders
In February 2018, Peters was transferred from the Sun City West branch to a JPMorgan branch in a less wealthy neighborhood. He perceived it as another example of managers, including Venniro, mistreating him because he was Black.
One day, Peters met Kennedy, then 38. Kennedy had played for five NFL teams as a defensive tackle. In 2011, he had joined the New York Giants - a homecoming that, The Times wrote at the time, was notable because of his impoverished childhood in Yonkers, New York. That season, Kennedy and the Giants won the Super Bowl.
Kennedy retired and later moved to Phoenix. JPMorgan bankers had been courting his business, but he had not liked the financial advisers the bank had proposed to manage his investments. Then he met Peters.
"The chemistry was just so real because he knew exactly what I needed to do," Kennedy said.
In the summer of 2018, Kennedy gradually moved $800,000 to the bank. Peters and a colleague promised he would get "private client" status, which was reserved for accounts with more than $250,000.
Landing a wealthy client like Kennedy was a big win for Peters, but he was anxious about being Targeted by his superiors.
On Aug. 24, Peters filed a formal complaint with the bank. He said he had alerted Venniro "that I feel that I am being treated differently because of my race and color of my skin" and that Venniro had suggested that the solution was for him to work in the less-wealthy branch.
Less than two weeks later, JPMorgan agreed to pay $24 million to end a class-action lawsuit brought by other Black employees who said the company had discriminated against them - in some cases by isolating them from colleagues and dumping them in poorer branches.
On Oct. 5, Venniro took Peters to a meeting room and said he was being fired. Venniro said he didn't know why.
"I'm just given marching orders," Venniro told him, according to a recording of the conversation.
Peters filed a discrimination claim with the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the civil rights division of the Arizona attorney generals office, accusing JPMorgan of racial discrimination. JPMorgan denied that and said Peters was fired for improperly assigning credit for a new client to en employee who managers did not think deserved it.
"We stand by our decision to terminate Peters," sa:d Wexler, the spokeswoman. "The facts are indisputable."
Peters disputed the facts. He said that he had given credit to the correct employee and that the bank was using a mundane internal dispute as an excuse to fire him. He has since started an investment advisory firm in Arizona.
'If this dude gets upset'
Peters' terminaion left Kennedy in the lunch. A number of his transactions were frozen or not carried out. In one case, $92,000 of Kennedy's money that was supposed to go into a new investment product ended up in a holding account, inaccessible to Kennedy. (Wexler said the problems were caused by administrative errors.)
JPMorgan assigned him a new financial adviser, Belton. He struck Kennedy as inexperienced. He was Black, and Kennedy thought that was the only reason they had been paired. Kennedy said he began recording their conversations so he could get feedback from other people about Beltons financial recommendations.
Kennedy had been under the impression that he had been granted the coveted "private client" status that Peters had promised. When Kennedy learned that was not the case, he complained to Belton - and then to Venniro.
Belton warned Kennedy not to talk to Venniro again. In two secretly recorded conversations in October 2018, he asked Kennedy to think about the impression he left on people at the bank. He pointed out that Kennedy was a big Black man in Arizona. And he said that Venniro had been afraid to tell Kennedy that his application to become a private client had been deleted when Peters was fired.
A few days later, Kennedy went back to the branch and the conversation returned to the question of why the bank refused to grant him the status and perks of being a private client.
Belton said that bank employees were scared of dealing with him and that therefore Kennedy would be better off interacting only with Belton.
"They're not going to say this, but I don't have the same level of intimidation that they have - you know what I'm saying? - not only being a former athlete but also being two Black men," Belton said.
Referring to Venniro, he added, "You sit in front of him, you're like three times his size - you feel what I'm saying? - he already probably has his perception of how these interactions could go."
Moments later, he said: "We've seen people that are not of your stature get irate, and it's like, 'Well, if this dude gets upset, like what's going to happen to me?'"
Kennedy asked if Belton was saying that Venniro was racist.
"I don't think any person at that level is dumb enough for it to be that blatant," Belton replied. "I don't have any reason to believe blatantly that he's that way. You feel what I'm saying? Now, whether there's some covert action? To be honest? I always err on the side of thinking that. You know, people that are not us probably have some form of prejudice toward us."
Kennedy pulled most of his money out of JPMorgan and filed a grievance with an industry watchdog and in June the bank sent him a letter trying to put an end to his complaining.
"You stated that Mr. Belton informed you that our firm was prejudiced against you and intimidated by you because of your race," the letter said. "We found no evidence to substantiate your allegations."

Texto completo: Former GOP Rep. Trey Gowdy has rejoined Fox News as a contributor following his attempt to join President Trump's legal team.
A network representative confirmed his return, which was first reported by Annie Karni of the New York Times, and it comes only two months after the two went different ways.
The network initially terminated their relationship with the former South Carolina representative in October after it became clear that he was planning on joining the president's outside counsel during the impeachment investigation. Despite his return to the legal profession after the midterm elections in 2018, federal law prevents Gowdy, 55, from taking on Trump as a client in the impeachment fight until Jan. 3, 2020.
The president told reporters that Gowdy was "a terrific guy," but that "there's a problem with, he can't start for another couple of months because of lobbying rules and regulations," on Oct. 10. Weeks later, he told CBS's Margaret Brennan that he had "no idea" if he was going to join the Trump legal team once he's legally permitted to do so.
Gowdy, who served four terms for South Carolina's 4th District, returned to his old legal firm Nelson Mullins Riley & Scarborough when he left Congress last January.

Texto completo: The president's concern is not so much whom he will be debating but the commission that runs the debates.
WASHINGTON -- President Trump is discussing with his advisers the possibility of sitting out the general election debates in 2020 because of his misgivings about the commission that oversees them, according to two people familiar with the discussions.
Mr. Trump has told advisers that he does not trust the Commission on Presidential Debates, the nonprofit entity that sponsors the debates, the two people said.
Less of a concern for Mr. Trump than who will emerge as the Democratic nominee is which media personality will be chosen as the debate moderator, according to people in contact with him.
At a state-of-the-race campaign briefing in Arlington, Va., the president's advisers declined to comment on what their plan was for the debates. One senior adviser to the president seemed to wince at the question, and said it was not something advisers were prepared to discuss until next year.
In the 2016 general election debates, Mr. Trump repeatedly complained about being at a disadvantage to Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee. And the post-debate polls showed Mr. Trump had good reason to be concerned: Mr. Trump and Ms. Clinton were essentially tied in the polls going into the first debate, but she received a bump after each of the three face-to-face matchups.
A Gallup poll conducted after the third debate, for instance, found that 60 percent of viewers thought Ms. Clinton did a better job, while 31 percent chose Mr. Trump.
After his performance in one of the debates was panned, Mr. Trump blamed a "defective mic" and questioned whether it was done "on purpose" to put him at a disadvantage. It turned out that a technical malfunction had indeed affected the volume of his voice during that debate, in September 2016.
That acknowledgment by the commission, however, never mollified Mr. Trump.
His 2016 debate team -- led primarily at that time by Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former New York City mayor -- also clashed with the commission over where to seat a group of women who had accused former President Bill Clinton of sexual assault or sexual harassment.
The Trump campaign invited the women as surprise guests to the second debate in St. Louis. Mr. Trump wanted them seated in his V.I.P. box, where Mr. Clinton would have to walk past them; they would also have been in her line of site from the stage. In the end, the campaign had to stand down after the commission threatened to call security and have the women removed.
Former Clinton aides said they expected Mr. Trump to participate in at least one 2020 debate, despite the president's hints that he would refuse. "Not doing any would not be strategically smart," said Philippe Reines, a longtime Clinton adviser, who predicted that "he'll bluff that he won't do any with the goal of only having to do one."

Texto completo: French government raises age to retire as strikes grind on
PARIS -- France's prime minister said Wednesday that the full retirement age will be increased for the country's youngest, but offered concessions in an ill-fated effort to calm a nationwide protest against pension reforms that critics say will erode the nation's way of life.
The government says it wants to make the pensions system sustainable and simpler but is facing public pressure, including a week of the most debilitating transport strikes in decades.
Major unions were quick to reject the proposals and vowed to strike on.
The day after more than 300,000 people protested across France, metro lines in Paris but two were closed and many train routes remained canceled as unions dig in their heels against President Emmanuel Macron, whom they accuse of shaping policies in favor of the rich.
Prime Minister Edouard Philippe detailed the pension changes in a speech Wednesday, saying bluntly that the French "will need to work longer."
People born after 1974 will have to work until age 64 to get a full pension, instead of 62 previously. Those born before that date will not be affected, he said.
The new scheme is aimed at replacing a complicated pension system that included dozens of special privileges for some sectors, like public transport, with one set of rules.
Philippe said the changes ensure the pension system is "fair and sustainable" for a growing population with a record number of people over 90.
For people entering the workforce, the reforms will only start to apply in 2022, which happens to be the last year of Macron's term.

Nobel laureate Suu Kyi defends Myanmar army in UN court
THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Nobel Peace Prize winner and former political prisoner Aung San Suu Kyi denied Wednesday that Myanmar's armed forces committed genocide, telling the United Nation's top court that the mass exodus of Rohingya people from the country she leads was the unfortunate result of a battle with insurgents.
The image of the former pro-democracy icon appearing before the International Court of Justice to defend the army that kept her under house arrest for 15 years was striking.
Myanmar's accusers have described a deliberate campaign of ethnic cleansing and genocide that drove more than 700,000 Rohingya to neighboring Bangladesh.
Suu Kyi calmly rebuffed allegations that army personnel killed civilians, raped women and torched houses in 2017.

Leaders scramble for votes as UK's ugly campaigning ends
LONDON -- Britain's election has been like the country's late-autumn weather: chilly and dull, with blustery outbursts.
On the last day of the campaign, political leaders dashed around the U.K. on Wednesday trying to win over millions of undecided voters who will likely determine the outcome.
Opinion polls suggest Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Conservatives have a lead over the main opposition Labour Party led by Jeremy Corbyn ahead of Thursday's election.
Britain's first December vote since 1923 for all 650 seats in the House of Commons has been dubbed the Brexit Election. It comes more than two years early in hopes of breaking the political deadlock over the country's stalled departure from the European Union.

Report: Giuliani settles long divorce from his third wife
NEW YORK -- Former New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and his third wife have reached a settlement in a yearslong court battle that exposed details about their luxurious lifestyle, The New York Times reported.
Giuliani, 75, and his wife, Judith, put an end to their differences and "intend to remain friends in the years to come," Judith Giuliani's divorce attorney, Bernard Clair, told the newspaper.
The couple was married for 15 years.
Throughout the divorce, details about the couple's $230,000 monthly budget became public, including six houses, 11 country club memberships and $12,000 on Rudy Giuliani's cigars.
Giuliani previously was married for 20 years to Donna Hanover. Before that, he was married for 14 years to Regina Peruggi.

YouTube cracks down on racist, sexist insults
SAN FRANCISCO -- YouTube is taking another step to curb hateful and violent speech on its site.
The video streaming company said it will now take down videos that lob insults at people based on race, gender expression, sexual orientation or other "protected attributes." The Google-owned company will also prohibit veiled threats of violence, taking a step further into moderating what people can say on the videos they create and upload.
YouTube has been slapped with criticism from politicians, viewers and video creators for the material it allows on -- and bans from -- the site. The site has been accused of allowing and fostering hate speech and extremism and creating spaces for harassment to linger online, along with other digital sites that allow people to upload their own material, such as Facebook and Twitter.

Chile: Debris found believed to be from missing plane
PUNTA ARENAS, Chile -- The Chilean Air Force says it has recovered debris believed to be from a military transport plan carrying 38 people that vanished days earlier en route to Antarctica.
Air Force Gen. Eduardo Mosqueira says "sponge" material was found floating roughly 18 miles from the place the C-130 Hercules last had radio contact.
It had left southern Chile and was flying over Drake Pass, a notoriously turbulent area.
Mosqueira said Wednesday the debris will be analyzed to see if it corresponds to the missing plane. He says the process could take up to two days to confirm.
The C-130 Hercules took off Monday afternoon from a base in far-southern Chile on a regular maintenance flight for an Antarctic base. Radio contact was lost 70 minutes later.

In Niger: About 100 Islamic militants ambushed an army camp in western Niger, a military spokesman said late Wednesday, killing at least 71 soldiers in the deadliest attack on the West African country's forces in years.
The large-scale attack comes amid a surge of assaults on army camps in the Sahel region, which have allowed jihadists to amass weapons and vehicles for their arsenal. Neighboring Mali has seen such an increase in ambushes on its army that it has even closed some of its most remote and vulnerable army outposts.
A Niger army spokesman read the death toll announcement on state TV Wednesday night and said a dozen others had been wounded after the ambush overnight.

Texto completo: Textbooks are too expensive.
As the semester ends, instructors at universities and community colleges around the country will begin placing their orders for next year's textbooks. But not all professors will pay enough attention to something that students complain about: the outlandish prices of the books we assign. Having grown at many times the rate of inflation, the cost of a leading economics book can be over $ 250; a law school casebook plus supplement can cost $ 277. Adding to such prices is the dubious trend of requiring students to obtain digital access codes, averaging $ 100, to complete homework assignments.
Professors love tough questions. Here's one we need ask ourselves: Are we helping rip off our students?
A good instructor wants to use the best materials, and some of the expensive textbooks are excellent and arguably worth the price. But some really aren't, especially when there are cheaper or free alternatives of equal quality out there. Basic ethics suggest we have a duty to look for cheaper options before we inflict the $ 200 or $ 300 books or the $ 100 access codes on our students. Professors who write successful textbooks need to think harder about the professional ethics of allowing a book to be sold at exploitative prices to young people.
The root problem is that it is just too easy for us, the professors, to spend other people's money. Just like doctors who prescribe expensive medicine, we don't feel the pain of buying a $ 211 book of uneven quality and no real use when the course is finished, or a digital access code that costs $ 100 and is designed at least in part to disable the used-book market. The fact that professors choose and students buy destroys whatever power a competitive market might have to keep prices lower. That, and a touch of greed -- the author of one successful book has earned an estimated $ 42 million in royalties -- is why textbook prices have increased over 1,000 percent since the 1970s.
For students, those $ 200 books add up to real money. The average student spends over $ 1,000 on textbooks each year; some spend more, and at state-subsidized community colleges, the prices of the textbooks can compare with tuition. As basic economics suggests, when prices rise, some people go without: students, often poorer students, try to get by without them.
For professors the path of least resistance is just to keep assigning the same book, in its latest edition. When prices were reasonable, that was a fine practice, but it is increasingly indefensible. There is sometimes substantial variation among textbook prices, and also books with stronger rental and used markets. In addition, important progress has been made by groups trying to create high quality alternatives. The Rice University-based nonprofit OpenSTAX has spent years developing high-quality, peer-reviewed textbooks that are free or cheap for more than 20 of the most popular college subjects. M.I.T. has an impressive collection of free online textbooks, and there are others. The publisher Cengage has been experimenting with a Netflix-style subscription model. At a minimum, instructors should at least take a look at what's out there.
As authors, we have another role to play. Writing a good textbook takes enormous time and effort, and most textbooks yield neither great uptake or riches. Given those odds, might it be worth devoting the efforts into a book designed to be cheaper, or even free, as a form of public service? As for the authors whose textbooks do achieve success, what are the professional ethics of agreeing to price a textbook plus materials at over $ 300, or agreeing to some of the more dubious "access code" schemes?
Teaching is a profession with its own ethical duties; students are both our charges and a captive market. I don't think there's anything wrong with assigning an expensive book if it is really worth the money and the alternatives are inadequate. (It helps if there's a good used or rental market). But we at least owe our students the time to make sure we aren't just absent-mindedly ripping them off.
I long felt guilty teaching first-year criminal law out of a mediocre book that was both detested by my students and priced at $ 235. I gave up and switched to a free book from Harvard's H2O project. It required work to switch, but it saved my students money and felt like a sweet liberation from a nasty racket.
Across the economy, over the last few years, there's been a backlash against exploitative pricing, headlined by the condemnation of figures like Martin Shkreli of Turing Pharmaceuticals. Textbook authors and publishers may not be selling necessary medicines, but the practice of exploiting market power to its fullest raises similar ethical questions. The old-fashioned phrase is "price gouging," and we shouldn't be a part of it.

Texto completo: Defense attorneys blame alcohol
Racist images cited in stabbing of black soldier Prosecutors and defense attorneys agree that Sean Urbanski killed Richard Collins III as the two men waited at a bus stop at the University of Maryland in the days before graduation. But both sides presented starkly contrasting motives in the fatal stabbing of the black Army lieutenant, who was killed at a time of heightened racial tension on the College Park campus.
Urbanski, who is white, had filled his mind with images that demeaned African Americans, and he killed the only black person at the bus stop in a race-fueled attack, prosecutors said in opening statements Wednesday at Urbanski's trial in Prince George's County Circuit Court.
'He poisoned his mind,' Principal Deputy State's Attorney Jason Abbott told jurors. Stifled gasps went around the courtroom when Abbott shared an image of a racist meme and slur found on Urban ski's phone that described the pleasure of seeing a black person stuffed into a wood chipper.
Attorneys for Urbanski, 24, of Severna Park, acknowledge that he killed Collins. But in a bid to secure a conviction less serious than first-degree murder and to avoid his being found guilty of a hate crime, they argued that their client acted on an alcohol-fueled impulse. The state's case, Urban ski's lawyers argued, amounted to sheer speculation about motive based on a handful of vile memes pulled from about 17,000 images on Urbanski's phone.
'This case is an unspeakable tragedy for all concerned,' William C. Brennan Jr., one of Urbanski's attorneys, told the jury, accusing prosecutors of 'using race to divide the community.'
The jury " 16 people, including four alternates " is majority African American.
Two years after Collins's killing, the panel heard the opening statements in a packed courtroom. Collins's mother sank against her husband's shoulder and wept as the trial got underway. A young woman sitting with Urbanski's family on the opposite side of the courtroom dabbed at tears when he entered.
Several people in the courtroom on the Collins family side wore black-and-white buttons with the words 'Love Not Hate' and two wore bright yellow T-shirts that read 'Justice for Richard.' Before breaking for lunch, the judge advised spectators against any emotional outbursts and directed those with visible mes sages of any kind to conceal them or face possible expulsion from the courtroom. After the lunch break, the yellow T-shirts had been turned inside out, and the buttons had been removed.
Surveillance cameras captured glimpses of what the defendant and the victim were doing in the hours leading up to their fatal confrontation and the crime itself. But the trial is expected to focus more on what Urbanski was thinking rather than what he did.
Urbanski and Collins each had been drinking with friends on the night of May 20, 2017, prosecutors said. Collins, a 23-year-old ROTC student who had received his commission as a second lieutenant in the Army a week or so earlier, was a few days from receiving his degree in business at Bowie State University. It was a festive time on both campuses as students prepared for graduation ceremonies.
About 3 a.m., Collins, with two friends, was waiting for an Uber at a bus stop on the U-Md. campus.
Urbanski, a former U-Md. student, came upon the group. He was screaming, but no one could make out what he was saying, Brennan said.
'Step left, step left if you know what's best for you,' Urbanski said, according to court documents.
'No,' Collins replied, according to the documents.
Urbanski attacked him, severing Collins's pulmonary artery with a single thrust of the knife, prosecutors said, and the knife later was found in his pants pocket.
Cpl. Thomas Kelley, a Prince George's County patrol officer who responded to scene, testified that he saw Urbanski sitting at the bus stop about 100 feet from Collins. Urbanski approached the officer, yelling incoherently, before Kelley ordered him to sit back down.
Prosecutors argued that Urbanski targeted Collins because his mind was filled with racist hatred.
At the bus stop, Urbanski stood off to the side and watched Collins talking with others for some time, prosecutors said. Urbanski left but later returned, confronting the group. He then bypassed a white man and an Asian woman before attacking Collins, who had his hands in his pockets, Abbott said.
Defense lawyers said Urbanski was raving drunk and might have attacked anybody in his way. They say that the material on his phone is undoubtedly hateful but that there's no evidence it's directly connected to what they deem Urbanski's impulsive actions that night.
Urbanski's attorneys said their client never advocated for violence against black people or other minorities, never issued any hateful manifesto, never demonstrated racism against anyone. And, Brennan said, Urbanski was too drunk that night to form any discernible motive. He suggested that Urbanski, who had lashed out at a sign with his fists earlier that night, was primed to attack anyone.
While questioning Cpl. Garfield Kelly, who was the lead detective from the U-Md. campus police, defense attorney John M. McKenna attempted to elicit evidence showing that Urbanski was mindlessly drunk.
McKenna asked whether, after Urbanski was detained, he was singing in the cell, urinating in a drain, and asking police why he was there and whether he could go home.
Isn't it true, McKenna asked, that when the detective told the suspect that he had killed someone, Urbanski began to cry?
'Objection,' one of the prosecutors said, and the corporal never answered.
Collins's killing occurred at a time when campuses around the country, including U-Md., were experiencing a surge in racist incidents documented by the Anti-Defamation League and others. That August, white supremacists and neo-Nazis paraded with torches at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville on a weekend that ended in violent clashes downtown and the killing of counterprotester Heather Heyer.
Urbanski must be convicted of murder or manslaughter to be convicted of a hate crime. If convicted of first-degree murder, he could face life in prison without parole.
Law enforcement officials initially said there was no evidence a hate crime had occurred. But police said later that Urbanski had some connection to 'Alt-Reich: Nation,' a Facebook page " since deleted " that police said trafficked in racist themes. Law enforcement, with the assistance of the FBI, dug into Urbanski's electronic gadgetry and social media postings and found memes expressing violent hostility toward African Americans and other racist material, according to prosecutors.
Defense lawyers have suggested that Urbanski's relationship to the offensive material is unclear and tenuous. They cite a New York Times interview with the Facebook page's creator saying the Alt-Reich site had been intended as satire.

The role of feminism in the movie 'Bombshell'

Texto completo: One of the more poignant televised moments of the Trump administration was White House counselor Kellyanne Conway going on CNN and sharing a deeply personal detail of her history. Ostensibly there to comment on the news, she instead found herself " unplanned, she'd later say " clearing her throat several times before telling Jake Tapper, 'I'm a victim of sexual assault.' Her voice trembled slightly, and then she jutted out her chin and continued with the job she'd come to do: defending Supreme Court nominee Brett M. Kavanaugh and President Trump.
It was such an emotional, unexpected moment, and I found myself wondering, not for the first time, what made Conway tick. How did she identify with, or not identify with, the #MeToo movement? Had she ever wondered how she might feel if someone dismissed her experience, as she's dismissed the testimonies of the 20-plus women who have accused Trump of sexual misconduct?
The first big-budget, post-#MeToo dramatization about sexual harassment opens this month in theaters around the country. It's not about the liberal activists who invented the hashtag or the liberal actors and politicians who championed it. 'Bombshell,' starring Charlize Theron as Megyn Kelly and Nicole Kidman as Gretchen Carlson, is about the toppling of Fox News founder and alleged serial sexual harasser Roger Ailes. So really, it's about the experiences of a group of strong conservative women.
The characters in 'Bombshell' suit up every morning in the Ailes-mandated uniform of short skirts and teetering heels because they dearly believe in the channel's mission. They're women who, after a producer in one scene mentions the New York Times, utter a collective, vocal ' ugh .' In another scene, a devoted employee has a lesbian sexual encounter. Does she feel conflicted about sleeping with a woman ? her paramour asks afterward. The Fox employee, noticing a Hillary Clinton poster in the bedroom, replies that she a) wants it to be clear she's not gay, and b) is mostly horrified she slept with a Democrat.
More than anything, the movie is about women who repeatedly announce, 'I'm not a feminist.'
Megyn Kelly's character says it not once but three times. In a staff meeting about an upcoming presidential debate, Kelly, who will be the debate moderator, shares her plan to ask then-candidate Trump about his derogatory statements toward women. 'Is this some feminist thing?' a wary colleague replies " as if only an unhinged misandrist would object to a man calling women 'fat pigs, dogs, slobs and disgusting animals.' Kelly's team immediately runs interference: ' She's not a feminist ,' they say in panicked unison.
We could quibble here about the definition of 'feminist' and argue that anyone fighting against slamming women for their appearances actually is one, at least on some level. But the relevant information is that Kelly doesn't see herself that way. Neither does a fictional composite character played by Margot Robbie " an ambitious reporter named Kayla who cites watching Fox News as a cherished communal tradition in her family.
They don't want to overhaul the system; they like the system just fine. They would simply prefer that as they moved through the system, their bosses stopped demanding to see their underwear.
'Bombshell' is a feature film, not a documentary, but it brings up interesting questions. How should a movement pushing for mass social change fold in women who are happy with the status quo? Who carry tremendous personal pain, but who are lukewarm on policy shifts that might stem pain for thousands of victims? And is feminism an identity or can it be actions undertaken by conflicted figures who drag stubborn institutions toward equality?

'My parents are Fox people,' screenwriter Charles Randolph shared at a recent Washington screening of 'Bombshell.' As he figured out how to tell a compelling story of sexual harassment, he thought of his family. His mom and dad might doubt the broader #MeToo movement, but they could identify with Megyn Kelly; They watched her every night. Telling the story from her perspective, Randolph said, 'would connect it to the idea that this isn't a partisan issue. Maybe my parents would pay attention to a woman who doesn't consider herself a feminist.'
At the same event, Theron talked about her struggle to portray Kelly, whom she finds emotionally inscrutable and politically distasteful, with the right notes of humanity. 'I want to believe we can all be terrible, and we can all still have a moment where we shine,' Theron said.
Which is, of course, the way to think about it. Good women, bad women, liberal women, conservative women, black women, white women, rich women, poor ones " none of them deserve to be sexually harassed, ever.
What I appreciated about 'Bombshell,' though, was its willingness to let the stories of these women be messy and complicated. Theron's Kelly is ostensibly the hero, but when she tells Robbie's Kayla that Kayla will be supported if she goes to HR to report her harassment, Kayla asks why Kelly never reported her own. It would have paved the way, she says, for more junior female employees. Kelly's face turns stony as she explains she had her own career to think about. Her feelings about Ailes are conflicted. Yes, he grabbed her and forcefully tried to kiss her. He also championed her career and, at times, offered mentoring that was entirely platonic.
This feels right, and true to life. The #MeToo movement isn't filled with saintly women and individual bad men. It's filled with complexities " women who turn the other cheek because they don't want to jeopardize their own success. Women who don't immediately do the 'right' thing because, frankly, it's not even clear what the right thing is half the time. Women who have been harassed or assaulted themselves, but can't believe that someone like Donald Trump or Brett Kavanaugh " or Bill Clinton or John Conyers Jr. " could be guilty of it. Abusers who have been genuinely wonderful friends and advocates to some victims, while making others' lives miserable.
Even bad men aren't bad all the time. They're human, of course. And even 'heroes' aren't good all the time. They're human, too.

Texto completo: Trump derangement syndrome manifests in increasingly puzzling ways, and Tuesday’s announcement by the White House about an executive order to be signed on anti-Semitism is perhaps the most galling recent example. In response to the serious situation for American Jews on college campuses (this Commentary article is a good primer), Trump issued an executive order to clarify that the Civil Rights Act of 1964 protects against anti-Semitism on college campuses, with the intention to extend the scope of the Civil Rights Act, which bars discrimination on the basis of race, color, and national origin, to include anti-Semitism as well.
Lahav Harkov of the Jerusalem Post explained on Twitter, “Title VI allows the government to revoke funding from schools if they discriminate based on a few things. Nationality is one, religion isn’t. The Executive Order was meant to allow schools to be penalized for anti-Semitic activity on campus.”
This is how many on the Left are choosing to cover it:
Tweet
And the freak-out over literally Hitler came right on cue:
Tweet
Erin Biba was so terrified she spent the rest of the night tweeting about eyeshadow. But, I digress.
Taking this step to carve out a special definition for Jewish peoplehood is hardly unprecedented; Jews have defended themselves as a people since the days of the Torah.
Tweet
Nevertheless, people who are all too happy to ignore campus anti-Semitism because it’s perpetrated by their own side would rather continue to deny the dire situation on campuses because it’s too inconvenient to their narrative.
Tweet
These liberals have spent the last day comparing the president of the United States to Adolf Hitler and Soviet government authorities — all because he has taken a step to protect Jewish students by pointing out how the uniqueness of the Jewish people can make them a target, similar to Muslim and Sikh Americans.
It’s obscene, and it sends a very clear message: They care more about scoring cheap political points than actually protecting Jews.
The origins of the hysteria begin with misreporting from the New York Times about how exactly the order worked and how Jews were specifically defined.
Tweet
It’s funny how all of these kinds of mistakes break in one direction and how concerned the president’s opposition is with the facts.
Tweet
Matt Gertz, a fellow at the liberal group Media Matters, pointed out this extremely inconvenient truth about the origins of the most offensive parts of this order: defining Jews as a separate and protected classification came from the Obama administration’s Department of Justice.
Tweet
One can argue that the executive order is bad for free speech on campus, and more generally, or that defining Jews in this manner may not be precise enough or set a good precedent. Unfortunately, almost none of its critics have decided to offer this kind of substantiate analysis. Instead they’ve chosen to compare the president to mass murderers.
It’s more of the same “Orange man bad” we’ve come to expect from the Left. In the process, we’ve come to see where their priorities lie, and it isn’t with Jews.

Texto completo: After two years of legal wrangling, Harvey Weinstein and the board of his bankrupt film studio have reached a tentative $25 million settlement agreement with dozens of his alleged sexual misconduct victims, a deal that would not require the Hollywood producer to admit wrongdoing or pay anything to his accusers himself, according to lawyers involved in the negotiations.
The proposed global legal settlement has gotten preliminary approval from all the major parties involved, according to several of the lawyers. More than 30 actresses and former Weinstein employees, who in lawsuits have accused Weinstein of offenses ranging from sexual harassment to rape, would share in the payout — along with potential claimants who could join in coming months. The deal would bring to an end nearly every such lawsuit against him and his former company.
The settlement would require court approval and a final signoff by all parties. It would be paid by insurance companies representing the producer’s former studio, The Weinstein Co. Because the business is in bankruptcy proceedings, the women have had to make their claims along with its creditors. The payout to the accusers would be part of an overall $47 million settlement intended to close out the company’s obligations, according to a half-dozen lawyers, some of whom spoke about the proposed terms on the condition of anonymity.
Representatives for Weinstein declined to comment. Lawyers did not respond to requests for comment for board members and other parties.
Weinstein is scheduled to be tried in New York in early January on charges of sexual assault involving two women. On Wednesday, a state judge raised his bail after prosecutors accused him of mishandling his ankle monitor. While his criminal prosecution has drawn public attention, the largely hidden negotiations over civil claims have been far more consequential for many of his accusers, who include women from the United States, Canada, Britain and Ireland.
More than $12 million — a quarter of the overall settlement package — would go toward some, but not all, legal costs for Weinstein; his brother, Bob; and other former members of their company’s board, the lawyers said. The board members would be insulated from future liability, and the alleged victims would drop their claims against Weinstein and other executives.
Several plaintiffs’ lawyers said Weinstein, who would avoid making a personal payout, had claimed that he might soon file for personal bankruptcy.
Katherine Kendall, 50, an actress who accused Weinstein of luring her to what she thought would be a work discussion in 1993 and then chasing her around his New York apartment while he was nude, said she was disappointed by the terms but had agreed to them partly because she didn’t want to block fellow plaintiffs from getting whatever recompense they could. “I don’t love it, but I don’t know how to go after him,” she said in an interview. “I don’t know what I can really do.”
Genie Harrison, a sexual harassment lawyer representing Sandeep Rehal, a former Weinstein assistant who is part of the proposed settlement, said that holding out for more favorable terms might have left the alleged victims empty-handed. A combination of preliminary legal rulings against various plaintiffs, laws that protect boards against liability, and previous failed settlement efforts had put the women in a weaker bargaining position.
“I don’t think there’s a markedly better deal to be made,” Harrison said. “We have really, truly done the best we can under the circumstances, and it’s important for other victims to know this, come forward and be able to get the best level of compensation we were able to get.”
The settlement would resolve lawsuits filed by dozens of women since 2017, when The New York Times exposed allegations of sexual harassment and abuse by Weinstein. Although the producer’s accusers include some of the highest-profile women in the entertainment world, such as Gwyneth Paltrow, Angelina Jolie and Salma Hayek, none have joined the proceedings. A lawsuit by actress Ashley Judd, who has said she intends to take Weinstein to trial, would not be part of the deal.
The process has been long and complicated, involving lawyers for the women, Weinstein, his former board members, creditors, insurers and the New York attorney general’s office. Last year, when The Weinstein Co. entered bankruptcy, the accusers watched a potential settlement payout dwindle from a projected $90 million victims’ fund that had been discussed as part of a possible sale of the studio. Then Eric T. Schneiderman, who as state attorney general had sued the studio and the Weinstein brothers and was steering settlement talks, resigned amid allegations that he had abused women.
Even if the proposed deal goes through, its terms would come with uncertainty. Eighteen of the alleged victims would split $6.2 million, with no individual getting more than $500,000. A separate pot of money, $18.5 million, would be set aside for those who were part of a class-action case, the New York attorney general’s suit and any future claimants, with a court-appointed monitor allocating payments based on the severity of the harm alleged.
Two women who have brought civil suits against Weinstein — Alexandra Canosa, a producer who used to work for him, and Wedil David, an actress — intend to challenge the tentative agreement, according to their lawyers.
Douglas Wigdor, who represents David, said he objected to the current deal because of a clause saying that if the two women did not participate, $1 million from the fund could be used instead by Weinstein for his own defense costs. He added that they would be precluded from pursuing board members or the insurance companies. “What’s most offensive is that they’re trying to force our client to settle,” Wigdor said.
Now that most of the participants have agreed to go forward, the lawyers can work to turn the preliminary term sheet into an official settlement agreement — a longer, more detailed document that will require approval from at least two judges, one from the federal court in Delaware overseeing The Weinstein Co.’s bankruptcy and the other from a federal court in New York. But it could still fall apart because of objections by lawyers representing the dissenting women.
The narrow scope of Weinstein’s upcoming criminal trial only heightens the significance of the civil settlement, likely to be the only legal recourse for many of the women who said he abused them. Because some alleged victims have declined to participate in a criminal trial, or have complained of offenses that are not criminal or fall outside the statute of limitations, the court case in New York centers on just two people.
One woman accused Weinstein of raping her at a Manhattan hotel in 2013, and the other claimed he forced oral sex on her at his town house in 2006. Weinstein has denied any nonconsensual sexual activity.
He also sought to have insurance companies cover the cost of his criminal defense if he were acquitted. They refused.
Zoe Brock, 45, a former model who has accused Weinstein of sexually inappropriate behavior, said in an interview that agreeing to the settlement terms made her feel “defeated and hopeless,” because neither Weinstein nor his former board members would be required to pay the alleged victims. But when she looked for legal alternatives, she found none.
Other plaintiffs said they were trying to find value in the tentative agreement.
“Many of us are outside the statute of limitations, and we can’t have our day in criminal court with Harvey,” said Caitlin Dulany, 56, who has accused Weinstein of sexually harassing and assaulting her in the mid-1990s. Even a flawed settlement, she said, might “bring some justice and relief.”

Texto completo: Unlike most politicians in Tallahassee and Washington, D.C., those in the Florida Keys don't mince words when talking about climate change.
How can they with two Key Largo neighborhoods having endured flooded streets for most of the past three months? The flooding arrived with autumn's king tides and didn't drain because the surrounding sea is so high. It's been an unusual year, but leaders expect more, given the impacts of climate change and sea-level rise.
How can they with commercial flood insurance premiums jumping 18 percent a year? Monroe County Mayor Heather Carruthers fears rising insurance costs will put commercial property values underwater in just five years.
How can they after learning it could cost $180 million to raise just three miles of road high enough to last 40 years? Monroe has over 300 miles of county roads. "It's not all doable," Rhonda Haag, the county's sustainability director, told the New York Times.
Some South Florida residents fear such frank talk could financially sink low-lying communities before the water that is coming our way in coming decades.
But denial was not the issue at last week's annual meeting of the Southeast Florida Regional Climate Change Compact - a coalition of Monroe, Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach County governments, plus 109 cities and two Native American tribal governments.
Rather, we heard an urgency for launching projects - now! - that can calm financial markets, slow insurance spikes and reimagine our region as a world leader in resiliency.
If action is taken now, regional leaders are optimistic that our coastal landscape can be reshaped and remain a vital economic engine for our state and nation. Where Miami Beach raised roads and installed pumps, for example, a city official said condo prices jumped 10 percent.
But first, a gut check, heightened by one of the worst king-tide seasons in memory, the slowing Gulf Stream and the lingering effects of Hurricane Dorian.
Conference presenters showed photos of recent tidal flooding like nothing previously seen in South Florida.
Others showed slides of coral, bird and fish populations in decline because of warmer temperatures and ocean acidification.
Still others raised red flags about the region's rising groundwater table, sludge-filled canals and aging flood-control gates, some of which are just six inches higher than the water they manage.
For the first time, conference speakers used words like:
* Woke. As in, more people and governments have awoken to the climate crisis this year.
* Retreat. As in, some low-lying neighborhoods cannot ultimately be saved.
* Courageous conversations. It's time for blunt talk with people living in risky places. Do we buy people out? Who decides?
* Accelerating. Five years ago, experts predicted a two-foot rise in South Florida sea levels by 2060. Now, because of rapidly melting ice sheets and how oceans circulate, this year's update projected another three to five inches by then.
* Tipping point. If we don't soon act to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions that are warming our planet, the window of opportunity will close within the decade.
* Lost decade: Under the leadership of former Gov. Rick Scott, Florida refused to address the threats we face from climate change. To this day, state officials cannot say what level of sea rise - if any - is considered when designing roads and buildings meant to last a hundred years.
But all was not doom and gloom at South Florida's 11th annual climate summit, held this year in Key West.
Also of note:
* Similar climate collaboratives are sprouting in Tampa Bay, East Central Florida, Northeast Florida and Southwest Florida. Soon, it will be hard for state and federal officials to ignore the coalesced voices of regional business, government, academic, nonprofit and neighborhood leaders.
* Because batteries can now store far more energy, solar power is becoming a disruptive technology for the fossil-fuel industry. Rob Kornaherns, owner of Fort Lauderdale's Advanced Roofing, the state's largest solar contractor, called battery storage a "real game-changer." By 2050, he sees everyone "off the grid around the world."
* Business leaders are engaged. Regional chamber of commerce leaders attended all three days of the conference and made their voices heard.
In one key moment, Ina Lee, a Fort Lauderdale tourism leader, asked the executive director of the South Florida Water Management District why the agency rolled back this year's tax rate, given that the region's flood control system needs billions of dollars in fixes.
And who's accountable, she asked a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers official, for flood-control gates just six inches shy of failure? "Eighteen of these structures are in danger of failing in Broward," Lee said. "There's too much at stake if it fails."
We get the sense that state and federal officials want to act. Drew Bartlett, who runs the water management district, said the agency isn't waiting for the feds to address a failing flood gate in Miami. And Glenn Landers, of the Army Corps, suggested ways the region could possibly find funds.
It would have been nice to see Florida Sens. Rick Scott and Marco Rubio make an appearance. They didn't even send a representative.
It would have been nice, too, to see Gov. Ron DeSantis attend as promised. He cancelled due to "extenuating circumstances." News reports showed him attending Miami's "Python Bowl Challenge," instead.
Still, we applaud DeSantis for having appointed a chief resilience officer, Julia Nesheiwat, who told conference attendees she is taking stock of infrastructure needs and addressing resilience with all state agencies. The governor also has appointed a chief science officer, Tom Frazer, who spoke about efforts to stem red tide and blue-green algae outbreaks.
We get the sense, though, that it's tricky for federal and state employees to say much. It's understandable, given the political climate in Washington, where Senate Republicans refuse to give climate change a hearing. The same is true in the Florida House, where Republican Speaker Jose Oliva - who lives in Miami, of all places - refuses to address sea-level rise.
Democratic state Rep. Kristin Jacobs of Broward cautions against partisanship in discussing climate change, emphasizing the importance of electing moderates, instead. Jacobs received the compact's lifetime achievement award this year for her foundational work in its formation, and her leadership on other water issues.
It's true that water knows no party. In some parts of South Florida in the autumn, the sea invades the homes and businesses of Republicans, Democrats and No Party Affiliates alike.
But we need state and national leaders who recognize that our seas, tides and groundwater tables are rising - and who share our region's sense of urgency.
We need more politicians like those in the Florida Keys, who like the canary in the coal mine, are calling attention to the danger ahead and demanding action - now!

As minor league baseball looks to cut teams, here's why Greenville Drive is here to stay

Texto completo: If Major League Baseball has its way, minor league teams in small cities across the country will face extinction — and while there is a list, at this point it doesn't appear that the Greenville Drive's name will be on it.
The $15 million in public and private money invested into renovations to Fluor Field in the past two years helped keep the Red Sox affiliate out of the cross-hairs of the contentious Professional Baseball Agreement negotiations now between MLB and Minor League Baseball.
The agreement, which expires next September, governs the association between minor league teams and their MLB affiliates — or, particularly at issue now, whether a team gets to be affiliated with the majors at all.
"The MLB's main concerns are about facility standards, and that's obviously not an issue in Greenville," Jeff Lantz, the MiLB's senior director of communications, told The Greenville News. "There shouldn't be any concern at all in Greenville."
The Drive's owner — Craig Brown, who in 2006 funded the baseball stadium's construction in the West End when the area was bereft of private investment — said that he couldn't comment on the negotiations between the MLB and MiLB, but he told The News the team is committed to staying in downtown Greenville.
"We're not going anywhere," Brown said, "and we don't anticipate anything changing in a material way."
Baseball America was the first to report on leaked plans to eliminate 42 of 160 minor league teams in what the MLB says is an effort to improve facilities, cut down on travel time with geographical restructuring and raise pay for minor league players.
Earlier this week, the New York Times shared a list of the 42 teams, which notably excluded the Drive and fellow Class A South Atlantic League members Asheville Tourists, Columbia Fireflies and Charleston RiverDogs.
GOP and Dems unite over contraction The MLB's proposal has drawn bipartisan scorn in Congress, including three whose respective districts include the Drive, Fireflies and RiverDogs.
U.S. 4th District Rep. William Timmons, a newly elected Greenville Republican, joined Democratic U.S. Reps. James Clyburn of Orangeburg and Joe Cunningham of Charleston in signing a pointed letter to MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred and 30 MLB teams.
"Minor league baseball is an important part of the fabric of cities and towns across the country, including Greenville," Timmons said in a statement to The News." I have serious concerns about the impact MLB's plans would have on those communities, and I hope they reconsider their proposal."
The congressional letter, signed by 104 representatives on both sides of the aisle, makes direct reference to the measures Congress has taken to preserve MLB's unique anti-trust protections instituted a century ago.
"We want you to fully understand the impact this could have not only on the communities we represent, but also on the long-term support that Congress has always afforded our national pastime on a wide variety of legislative initiatives," the letter states.
The letter was penned by Massachusetts Democrat Lori Trahan, whose district includes the Lowell Spinners, which face disassociation, and Republican David McKinley of West Virginia, which stands to lose three of its four minor league teams.
"Reducing the number of Minor League Baseball clubs and overhauling a century-old system that has been consistently safeguarded by Congress is not in the best interest of the overall game of baseball, especially when Major League Baseball's revenues are at all-time highs," the letter states.
In a four-page answer to Congress, MLB deputy commissioner Dan Halem wrote that MiLB is "framing the issue as saving baseball in communities that presently have it."
However, Halem wrote, the MLB's "very brief negotiations" with MiLB have shown that minor league owners are more concerned about the value of their franchises and that some of them are "presently attempting to relocate their affiliates to different cities or sell them outright."
Millions more in investment coming to Drive stadium The Drive wouldn't be among any teams considering a move to another locale.
Over the course of the past few years, the city of Greenville pledged $5 million in tourism-related tax money to fund improvements to Fluor Field, which included new entrance plazas, seats atop the replica Green Monster and expansion of club seats, among other improvements.
The Drive contributed $10 million.
Mayor Knox White, who before the Drive's arrival presided over the departure of the Class AA Greenville Braves to Mississippi, said public and private partners must continue to invest in ballparks to "stay fresh."
Other cities, White said, "don't invest, and the stadium shows it, and enthusiasm has waned. Obviously we're not in that category at all. We've never been in that category."
The Drive organization introduced trolleys into downtown Greenville, which evolved into the popular trolley system in operation today.
The ballpark was designed with low elevations so as not to tower over the West End community and using brick matching its surroundings.
"We've built our brand around the sense of community," Brown said, "and it's always been our desire to be a part of the fabric of the community. Hopefully our record speaks for itself."
Now, the organization is cooperating on a project to turn Field Street into a convertible entertainment area that would be renamed "Jackson Way," after Greenville baseball legend Shoeless Joe Jackson.
The project would be in conjunction with the development of the .408 Jackson apartment development — a reference to Jackson's batting average in his first season, which remains a rookie record — and would involve relocation of the Shoeless Joe Museum to the corner of Markley Street.
The transformation into Jackson Way would allow Field Street to be closed for events and then re-opened. The city has offered a preliminary cost estimate of $2.1 million.
"That's going to keep us busy in the next year or two," Brown said.
A return to Class AA? The ongoing negotiations between MLB and MiLB won't result in any sudden moves in 2020 like, Lantz said.
However, the MLB's plans to shrink the South Atlantic League from 14 teams to six could create a new Mid-Atlantic League that would better align teams geographically.
Currently, the Drive travel as far north as New Jersey.
When the Greenville Braves played in Municipal Stadium at Conestee Park until the 2004 season, the higher Class AA status of the Southern League featured more-talented future Braves, like Chipper Jones and John Smoltz, than Class A could provide.
In making the case for minor league baseball's return to Greenville, advocates at the time said that the attraction of the ballpark would outweigh the rank of the league class.
A return to Class AA isn't out of the question in any realignment, Lantz said.
"If it makes sense for that team to be in the Southern League and they've got the market size and can handle a league like that, why wouldn't we?" Lantz said.
In any case, a minor league team's association with a major league team is important, the mayor said.
"I'd love to see us move to AA," White said, "but the affiliation with Boston has been important."
The MLB's proposal would assign the affected 42 teams into an independent "Dream League," similar to the NBA's "G-League" that allows unsigned players to prove themselves.
That proposal would effectively kill the respective organizations' ability to remain legitimate franchises, Lantz said.
One team on the list of 42 — the Beloit Snappers in Wisconsin — would be removed after leadership there agreed to build a new stadium, Lantz said. In its place, he said, the Quad Cities River Bandits in Iowa would join the endangered.
As part of its negotiations, Lantz said, the MiLB wants to know how teams were selected — such as the Lexington Legends in Kentucky, which won the past two South Atlantic League championships after the Drive won in 2017 and have had strong attendance.
"That's a big part of what this first part of the discussion will be," he said.

Texto completo: Tempe might be best known as a college town filled with maroon-and-gold clad students, but at least one pocket within the city leaves a different impression.
The neighborhood just west of Mill Avenue and south of University Drive — named Maple-Ash after the two main streets that run through it — is a community filled with historic houses, longtime Tempe residents and local businesses.
Residents ride bicycles down streets lined with bungalows that peek out between old-growth trees. Popular local spots border the area adjacent to Arizona State University, including the original location of Cartel Coffee, Casey Moore's Oyster House and Otto Pizza and Pastry, which has been open for nearly three decades.
In early November, a 40,000-square-foot Whole Foods grocery store opened its doors just across the street from the neighborhood's north edge. Housed in a multi-level apartment complex, the store features a two-story bar named On Ash.
The presence of the new store and bar, both of which appear to aim to capitalize on the free-spirited reputation of the longstanding Tempe community, has upset some who live close by.
Maple-Ash resident Peter James has lived in the area since 2010.
"The city seems to want to create an upscale downtown," James says. "And that is squashing all the culture."
How Whole Foods is changing Maple-Ash Amid a sea of construction cranes and luxury apartment complexes, Whole Foods is just the most recent display of the changes happening throughout Tempe and around Maple-Ash.
Extending from University Drive to the north and Hudson Lane to the south and from the Union Pacific Railroad tracks east to Mill Avenue, the neighborhood boasts the largest concentration of historic homes in Tempe.
Not surprisingly due to its proximity to Mill Avenue and ASU's Tempe campus, Maple-Ash has become increasingly filled with students and the housing complexes built for them. In some cases, homes have been demolished and multi-resident condo complexes have sprung up in their place.
The new Whole Foods, which opened its sliding glass doors on Nov. 6 at 750 S. Ash Avenue, occupies the lower levels of a new apartment complex named The Local — where the cheapest listed unit, a 540-square-foot studio, costs $1,414 a month, according to The Local's website.
'It was a very free-spirited area before' Drew Sullivan owns Ash Avenue Comics, a long-standing comic book shop on the corner of Ash Avenue and University Drive. He lived in the Maple-Ash neighborhood for close to 18 years and still lives nearby. He described The Local as "pretty despised."
"It was a very free-spirited area before, areas were branded as arts districts," Sullivan says. "It was an affordable neighborhood if you were a younger working person."
He says developments like the one in which Whole Foods is located can drive up rent.
"Landlords take notice of developments like this," Sullivan says. "They point to this to justify raising rent, so you get a $300 rent increase and nothing in your life improves."
Property values in the Maple-Ash zip code have skyrocketed in recent years. From 2011 to 2018, the area saw median house prices increase by 141%.
Neighbors also are concerned about increased traffic in the area due to the new development. Over the years, neighbors have witnessed car crashes at the intersection of Ash and University. Now, the entrance and exit from Whole Foods' multistory parking garage feed directly into that crossroads.
Tempe neighborhood associations including Maple-Ash and those from the nearby Wilson Art and Garden District and Mitchell Park neighborhoods held public meetings to address the dangerous area and come up with a traffic mitigation plan.
Why Whole Foods says it's a great fit Whole Foods created its brand around selling foods free from hydrogenated fats, artificial colors, flavors and preservatives along with organic and local products. Although a national chain now, each Whole Foods location carries products local to the state they are in.
The Maple-Ash neighborhood's history of supporting local makes this the perfect location for Whole Foods, says Regional Produce Coordinator Chris Petroulakis, who was enjoying a slice of pizza at On Ash on a recent weekday afternoon.
"The local concept is awesome for Whole Foods," he says. "The Tempe area has a great love for local, so it's a big plus."
However, others see the development including Whole Foods and On Ash as attempts to take advantage of the culture of the neighborhood — while simultaneously pushing out the businesses that make it unique.
"I remember walking down Mill, buying hemp jewelry and sneaking into concerts I was too young for," Maple-Ash resident Peter James says. "There used to be a Mill Avenue sound, bands like the Refreshments and the Gin Blossoms, but those days are gone."
Neighbors say they're being 'pushed out' The exact spot where Whole Foods now stands housed a natural foods cooperative called Gentle Strength that operated in Tempe for 36 years. Across the railroad tracks on Farmer Avenue now sits Tempe Farmers Market, a small organic and local-based grocery store.
Neighbors have voiced concerns that Whole Foods could negatively impact longstanding and beloved local landmarks. On Ash, specifically, adds competition for local bars.
"Some of these places you know the owners after a while, your kids go to school with their kids. They are staffed and owned by people that are part of the community. Now it doesn't feel like the Tempe I know, it feels like we are being pushed out," James says.
The bar being named On Ash was an additional insult in Sullivan's eyes.
"It just seemed like really transparent posturing to brand themselves as having a connection to the area," Sullivan says.
Neighbors also say that while the area has needed a grocery store, residents would be better served with a more affordable option. In April, the New York Times reported prices at Whole Foods average 15% higher than at a typical grocery store.
Others say Whole Foods is 'nice to have' But not all Tempe residents share the same concerns over the new grocery store and bar. For some, the store provides a convenient place to get fresh groceries and the new bar makes a good place to study.
On a recent Thursday afternoon, ASU sophomore Nina Sterneld sat in On Ash's upper lounge to do homework.
"I can't drive so before, I had to Uber to Trader Joe's but it's really far," she says. "It's nice to have local foods close to campus and I like this lounge area because there's not a lot of people and I like the quiet."
Danielle Lyons, a resident of the Maple-Ash neighborhood, isn't worried On Ash will take business away from local haunts anyway. It doesn't have the same neighborhood clout and unlike most Tempe bars, which stay open until midnight or 2 a.m., On Ash closes at 10 p.m.
On a recent afternoon, she was sitting on the patio of Casey Moore's.
"I don't think people are going to say, 'Oh hey, let's go catch a drink at Whole Foods,'" she says with a laugh.

For Susan, who found strength in the stars

Texto completo: This story was first published on Dec. 24, 2014, six months after Susan Spencer-Wendel, our longtime colleague at The Palm Beach Post, died of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, known as Lou Gehrig’s disease. She was 47. We are reprinting it today to celebrate Susan’s eternal message of friendship and hope, and to offer comfort to anyone grieving the loss of a friend this holiday season,
When she knew she was dying, Susan Spencer-Wendel sought the stars.
She looked up. Way up. Up to the Yukon, near the North Pole.
That’s where a most colorful collision happens — where electrically charged particles from the sun blow into the Earth’s atmosphere and crash into other particles, creating a light show of glorious green, blue, violet, red and pink.
In the Northern Hemisphere, the spectacle is called the Northern Lights, or Aurora Borealis, the “Dawn of the North.” In the Southern Hemisphere, it’s Aurora Australis, or “Dawn of the South.”
This dawn is a catharsis, a kaleidoscope created from destruction.
Life is like that, Susan might say.
The most explosive mess can become the most beautiful experience.
Susan might say that, if she were still here.
She left a literary legacy — her memoir, “Until I Say Good-bye: My Year of Living With Joy,” a 390-page book she wrote in four months, tapping it out on her iPhone with her right thumb, after Lou Gehrig’s disease had paralyzed the rest of her fingers.
If you read that book, which became a New York Times best-seller, or if you knew Susan, you have been changed as surely as those colliding gas particles in the cosmos.
You simply can’t be the same person after Susan as you were before Susan. You can’t complain about stupid, small things. You can’t get all twisted with anxiety and fear.
To do so is to poison the present moment.
To do so is to forget that happiness is a choice.
To do so is to waste Susan’s suffering.
Exiting without expectation
The first Christmas after you lose a loved one is hard, of course.
All of December is hard for Susan’s sister, Stephanie Harwood Parlamento, and Susan’s lifelong best friend, Nancy Maass Kinnally, because the month is filled with milestones.
All of their birthdays are in December — Nancy’s on the 11th, Stephanie’s on the 15th and Susan’s on the 28th. She died before her 48th birthday.
Susan took trips with both Nancy and Stephanie after her diagnosis, when she knew the disease would quickly snuff the power from her muscles. She went to the Yukon on a quest to see the Northern Lights with Nancy. She took a cruise with Stephanie.
The three of them shared “a bond of sisterhood,” and Nancy and Stephanie became mother substitutes for Susan’s three children — the hands to do the hugging when Susan no longer could.
They were at Susan’s bedside as she was dying. They waited agonizingly as she took one halting breath, then paused, then another breath, then a longer pause.
Stephanie saw her sister flash her last smile — a flirtatious smirk at her physical therapist, Steve Sylvester, after he accidently bumped her.
That was one day before she slipped into a coma. Her smile muscles were among the very last to go. How Susan could smile so brightly in spite of crippling sickness amazed people, but she might say it was just another case of beauty born from destruction.
The universe is perfect as it is, she might say. Please stop believing life must be a certain way for you to be happy.
When Susan died June 4, 2014 she exited without expectation.
Her life had become a balance of light and dark, a lesson in how to navigate without stars in that black space where everything is unknown, even whether her lungs could gasp another breath.
She had learned to excel in what Buddha called “spaciousness” — the ability to be with life as it is, free of grasping, desperation, anger. Free of expectation of what should be. That a mother should be at her daughter’s wedding. That she should see her sons grow into men. That life should be fair.
Those shoulds kill us moment by moment, Susan might say, like tiny acts of spiritual suicide.
Decide to be happy, and you will be, she’d say. Make up your mind.
“There’s only one thing you can never get away from,” she’d say. “And that’s your own mind.”
A star is born
There’s a tendency to turn inspirational people who die young into saints, but Susan was not a saint.
She celebrated her quirks — she smoked, loved wine, dropped the F-bomb, adored showing off her shapely legs and wearing stiletto heels and making sassy comments.
She was scared for her body to wither away and die, and she said so with the directness she employed in all communication.
That directness helped focus her mind — to try to release the fear as fast as she could and try to control only what she could control.
There is no cure for ALS, so, she said, she practiced not wanting a cure.
She practiced not resisting nature and “going gracefully into the night.”
Directness also made her an excellent reporter. She worked at The Palm Beach Post for 20 years.
No gooey adjectives, please, she’d say. No sticky-sweet sentiment. No playing the emotional violin.
She would much prefer to be humanized than hero-ized.
She wanted her memoir to be called “Sliding Home Sideways” — but her publisher, HarperCollins, didn’t think everyone would get her humor.
Stephanie and Nancy got her humor. They got her totally. For Christmas 2012, Susan gave them each gold necklaces — intertwined circles with her name engraved on one disc and their names engraved on the other.
For Christmas 2013, Susan treated them to dinner at Buccan in Palm Beach.
She smiled when Nancy and Stephanie got tipsy on one Cosmopolitan.
Oh, and a few sips of Prosecco. Susan could take one or two sips herself.
She could not chew, but she could smile at their delight in the food. By then, she had become a full-time, smiling observer.
“Isn’t that one of the most beautiful gifts you can give a person?” Stephanie says.
“To genuinely be happy for their happiness? To thrill in their joy?”
Nancy and Stephanie will be together on Susan’s birthday this week. They’ll have a Cosmo toast to her — and look up to the cosmos, too.
They’ll remember the day they all saw the Hubble 3D movie at the Kennedy Space Center, and how Susan became enraptured by the infinite expanse of the universe and the life cycle of stars — how stars are born and how they die, how their energy shifts and they become something new.
“She loved space and that whole notion of looking beyond the self,” Nancy says. “Because that was where she had to dwell — she had to dwell beyond her physical self.”
In the failing of her body, she became her soul and her spirit.
“She became her essence.”
And she looked up. Way up. To the stars.

WILL PROGRESSIVES BLOCK THE DRUG PRICING BILL? That’s the big question Tuesday as the House Rule Committee prepares to advance the Elijah E. Cummings Lower Drug Costs Now Act.
Ryan Grim and David Dayen at The Intercept and the American Prospect write that a dramatic showdown is ahead between Democratic leadership and the Congressional Progressive Caucus, which counts 98 in its membership and feels the legislation doesn’t go far enough in cracking down on the pharmaceutical industry.
Progressives don’t like that the bill only requires that 25 drugs get negotiated, with more negotiations being optional, and they’re upset that a provision from Rep. Pramila Jayapal of Washington to discourage companies from hike drug prices has been watered down.
The Rules Committee is voting on the bill Tuesday, which would then send it to the floor for a vote on Thursday. If Progressives block the bill, then negotiations will continue.
But that’s not the end of the story. Progressives could agree to let the bill reach the floor as long as members get to vote on their amendments. Ultimately, only 18 votes against the bill from members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus would be enough to sink it, given that all Republicans are expected to vote against.
Reminder: This bill won’t become law, but is a messaging tool for Democrats, who ran on the promise to lower drug prices in 2018 and want to show that they will follow through if voters elect a Democrat to the White House in 2020. It’ll be a problem for the party if they don’t succeed at passing the bill this week.

‘MEDICARE FOR ALL’ GETS ITS MOMENT IN E+C: Co-sponsors of the Medicare for All Act have been pushing for this for a while, after scoring House hearings in three other committees. Once again, however, the proposal will have to share the spotlight. Eight other bills that aim to insure more people will be up for debate. The hearing kicked off Tuesday morning just ahead of our newsletter send off. Tune in to see how it goes.
INDIANA ASKS SUPREME COURT TO TAKE UP ABORTION LICENSING QUESTION: This involves an abortion clinic in South Bend, Indiana, the hometown of Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg, where he is mayor. On Tuesday morning, GOP Attorney General Curtis Hill asked the Supreme Court to reverse a decision by 7th Circuit to let an abortion clinic remain open, despite being denied a license by the state health department. In denying the license, the state said that the clinic in question, Whole Woman's Health, didn’t provide documentation about its safety record in other states.
‘PAID LEAVE FOR ALL’ LAUNCHES AS THE ISSUE GETS THE SPOTLIGHT IN WASHINGTON: The new “Paid Leave for All” campaign comes as the House Oversight and Reform Committee holds a hearing on the issue (tune in) and as the White House is holding a summit Thursday on paid leave.
The campaign is pushing the Democratic approach to paid leave, which would fund parental and sick leave through a payroll tax. Organizations involved in the push include Family Values at Work, the National Partnership for Women and Families, the Center for American Progress, a Better Balance, Moms Rising, and several labor unions.
It’s all rocket science. The Washington Post scooped this weekend that there’s a deal afoot to allow paid leave for federal workers in exchange for Congress funding Space Force, which would become the sixth branch of the military.
GOP INTRODUCES A COUNTERMOVE TO PELOSI’S HEALTHCARE COSTS BILL: House Republicans, including Greg Walden and Michael Burgess, introduced the Lower Costs, More Cures Act Monday to counter Pelosi’s bill. Here is a summary of the GOP bill’s most notable provisions:
FORMER TRUMP DOCTOR IS RUNNING FOR CONGRESS: Former White House doctor Ronny Jackson has filed paperwork to run for representative of Texas’s 13th District, hoping to take over retiring congressman Mac Thornberry’s seat. Trump nominated Jackson Department of Veterans Affairs, but he withdrew from his nomination amid allegations that he was drinking on the job and over-prescribed medication. Jackson denied the allegations, and Trump was outraged at Senate Democrats over the incident.
‘NO ONE’S IN CHARGE’: DEFENSE OFFICIALS COULDN’T STEM THE FLOW OF DRUGS FROM AFGHANISTAN: In 2004, then-Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld wrote to the undersecretary of Defense Douglas Feith that the U.S. government had no strategy to stem the flow of drugs out of Afghanistan following the 2001 invasion. Rumsfeld wrote: “with respect to drug strategy for Afghanistan, it appears not to be synchronized — no one’s in charge.” The memo is part of an extensive collection of government documents detailing the failures of the invasion, including several from Rumsfeld asking the Bush administration for a plan to take on Afghanistan’s opium trade, which skyrocketed after 2001.
PrEP ON DEMAND? That’s the topic of Kimberly’s latest magazine item, which dives into the push to make HIV-prevention drugs more available to patients who need them. Next year in California, pharmacists who undergo training will be able to prescribe the drugs to patients, and more states are likely not far behind.

Texto completo: Seven more women have come forward with accounts of unwanted sexual touching by actor Cuba Gooding Jr. going back to 2003, prosecutors said in court documents, bringing the number of his accusers to 22.
Gooding, 51, has been charged with groping three of the women at Manhattan restaurants and nightclubs in 2018 and 2019. The other 19 have accused him of unwanted contact; those accusations, which come from several states, have not resulted in charges because, for the most part, they took place too long ago. But prosecutors in Manhattan are hoping to persuade a judge to allow the women to testify.
Prosecutors had previously revealed 12 additional accusers, and in a court filing obtained Monday by The New York Times, they listed seven more. In one accusation detailed in the court filing, a woman said that after she met Gooding at the Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah, in 2009, he took her to a concert, where he began to kiss her in a secluded hallway as she was attempting to leave.
Gooding then placed his hands on her buttocks, and pushed onto her crotch so forcefully that her tights ripped, according to the court filing. The woman bit Gooding’s cheek so she could escape, the filing said.
Another woman accused Gooding of sliding his hand down her pants and cupping her buttocks at a restaurant in Atlanta in 2011, and a different accuser said that he grabbed her vagina twice at a restaurant in Malibu, California, in 2016, according to the court filing. The other four women said Gooding had groped or kissed them without their consent in Manhattan, Los Angeles and San Francisco, and at a nightclub near the Sundance festival in 2003.
A lawyer for Gooding, Mark J. Heller, did not immediately provide a response to the new allegations Monday. Heller has previously said that Gooding denied any criminal wrongdoing and that when a celebrity is charged, people often “come out of the woodwork with allegations that are all over the place and, for the most part, aren’t provable.”
A spokeswoman for the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office declined to comment on whether any of the additional accusers had gone to local police with their accusations against Gooding.
Prosecutors want permission from a judge to admit the 19 women as witnesses against Gooding, even though he has not been charged in those instances. An assistant district attorney, Jenna Long, said in the court documents, which were filed Nov. 18, that allowing a jury to hear from these witnesses will help show a “pattern of behavior.”
A judge will decide Jan. 22 whether to admit any of the additional witnesses. Prosecutors in Manhattan are attempting a similar strategy in the coming sexual assault trial of Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein. Decisions on whether to admit such witnesses generally depend on how similar their accounts are to the behavior the defendant is formally charged with, and whether admitting them would prevent the defendant from receiving a fair trial.
Gooding has been formally charged in three reported incidents, each resulting in misdemeanor charges of forcible touching and third-degree sexual abuse. He has pleaded not guilty. The maximum penalty for the top charge, forcible touching, is a year in jail.
In the court filing, the district attorney’s office also detailed for the first time the circumstances behind the third pair of charges against Gooding. Prosecutors said that on the night of Sept. 9, 2018, at Lavo, an Italian restaurant on East 58th Street with a downstairs nightclub, Gooding kissed the cheek of a server without her consent and then later grabbed her neck to try to kiss her mouth, touching her tooth with his lips as she tried to turn her head away. That same night, Gooding licked another server’s hand, the court filing said.
Gooding was previously charged with grabbing a woman’s breast at a rooftop bar near Times Square in June and pinching the buttocks of a woman who served him at a nightclub in October 2018.

David Leonhardt: Save local journalism! Support nonprofit news organizations.

Texto completo: Anyone who’s worried about the state of local journalism faces a conundrum.
On the one hand, good local news coverage brings big societal benefits, as multiple studies have found. When newspapers shrink or close, voter turnout and civic engagement tend to decline, while political corruption and polarization rise. Even I — a journalist, obviously — have been surprised by the magnitude of these findings.
On the other hand, some of the country’s largest local newspaper owners, like GateHouse Media (which recently bought Gannett) and Alden Global Capital, don’t seem to care about good local news coverage. They’re stripping newspapers of their assets to make a buck. So if you decide to support your local newspaper by subscribing to it, you may be supporting good journalism — but you may not.
That’s why I was pleased to hear about the American Journalism Project, a new group created to support nonprofit local publications. Tuesday, it’s announcing its first batch of grants — 11 of them, to publications around the country. I recognized the names of several winners, like WyoFile, VTDigger and The Connecticut Mirror, because readers have emailed me about them when I’ve asked which local publications you trust.
The co-founders of the project, Elizabeth Green (a journalist) and John Thornton (a technology investor), have big ambitions. They think the country needs to raise about $500 million a year in national philanthropy for local news, which could then be matched by another $500 million in membership fees, advertising and other local revenue. The combined $1 billion would allow local publications to approach the size of public radio.
It would also make a meaningful dent in the roughly $2 billion annual decline of local newspaper budgets in recent decades. From 1990 to 2016, about 60% of American newspaper jobs disappeared, according to the Labor Department, and the decline has surely continued since 2016. The main reason is the sharp drop in print advertising revenue.
Thornton — who in 2008 founded the Texas Tribune, which has become a model nonprofit newsroom — calls local journalism “a public good that the market does not provide in sufficient quantity.” But unlike many other public goods, such as libraries, schools and roads, journalism can’t be funded by the government without violating the spirit of a free press. Philanthropy must fill the void, Thornton says.
When I met with him and Green recently, I asked them how they would make sure nonprofit publications were doing a good job — since nonprofits don’t face the market accountability that for-profit businesses do. I like the answer: The American Journalism Project will measure the health of publications largely through their ability to raise other money, such as through memberships or reader donations. To receive support, a publication will need to demonstrate that readers consider it valuable.
Keep that in mind if you’re trying to figure out how you can help local journalism and, by extension, democracy. If your area has a new nonprofit publication you like, support it — by reading it, engaging with it through both praise and criticism and, yes, sending it some money.
Speaking of which: If your favorite local publication isn’t among the 11 initial winners, send me an email putting in a good word for it. One or two quick sentences about why you like it would be enough. You can reach me at leonhardt@nytimes.com; please include the word “local” in the subject line.
For more …
• One of the 11 grant winners is the Center for Investigative Journalism in Puerto Rico, whose reporting this year helped bring down the island’s governor. The other grantees are Mississippi Today; Berkeleyside (in California); NOISE (Nebraska); City Bureau (Chicago); inewsource (San Diego); MLK50 (Memphis); and Underscore (Portland, Oregon).
• Julie Bosman of The Times wrote last month:
“School board and city council meetings are going uncovered. Overstretched reporters receive promising tips about stories but have no time to follow up. Newspapers publish fewer pages or less frequently or, in hundreds of cases across the country, are shuttered completely. All of this has added up to a crisis in local news coverage in the United States that has frayed communities and left many Americans woefully uninformed, according to a report by PEN America released on Wednesday.”
• Local journalism can reduce partisan polarization, as one study found, partly because it gets people talking about something other than the national hot-button issues. “Local news should be the public square in which you engage your neighbors as people, to solve problems you can see, rather than on politics as a national religion,” Green told me.
• Josh Stearns of the Democracy Fund has written a good summary of the academic research on local journalism. Democracy Fund is one of the funders of the new project, along with Arnold Ventures, Emerson Collective, Craig Newmark Philanthropies and others.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Houston's police chief sharply criticized the two Republican U. S. senators from his state and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell over gun control legislation during an emotional news conference as he prepared to escort the body of a police officer killed in the line of duty to a funeral home.
Sgt. Christopher Brewster, 32, was fatally shot Saturday while responding to a domestic violence call.
Police Chief Art Acevedo called on the Senate on Monday to renew the Violence Against Women Act, which expired in February. In April, the House passed a version of the bill that includes a provision expanding the definition of domestic abusers who would be prohibited from owning guns.
"We all know in law enforcement that one of the biggest reasons that the Senate and Mitch McConnell and John Cornyn and Ted Cruz and others" have not reached a compromise on the bill is that the National Rifle Association "doesn't like the fact that we want to take firearms out of the hands of boyfriends that abuse their girlfriends," Acevedo said.
"And who killed our sergeant?" he asked. "A boyfriend abusing his girlfriend.
"You're either here for women and children and our daughters and our sisters and our aunts, or you're here for the NRA," he said.
He said he did not want to see the Republican lawmakers' "little smug faces" as they talk "about how much they care about law enforcement when I'm burying a sergeant because they don't want to piss off the NRA. "
"Make up your minds," Acevedo said. "Whose side are you on? Gun manufacturers, the gun lobby or the children that are getting gunned down in this country every single day?"
Cornyn responded with a tweet blaming the impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump.
"Unfortunately, important legislation like this has fallen casualty to impeachment mania," Cornyn said. "We will keep trying to pass a bipartisan bill but it takes two (parties) to tango. "
Under federal law, all felons are prohibited from owning firearms. People who have been convicted of misdemeanor domestic abuse against a spouse, ex-spouse, co-parent or someone the victim has lived with are also prohibited. That leaves women who are dating, but not living with, an abuser vulnerable under what critics call the "boyfriend loophole. "
The House version of the Violence Against Women Act would expand the prohibited users to include convicted stalkers and those convicted of abusing someone whom they are not married to or living with.
The NRA opposed the legislation as too broad and vaguely defined.
Spokeswoman Jennifer Baker told The New York Times that "many of those 'offenses’ – and I’m using air quotes here – the behavior that would qualify as a stalking offense is often not violent or threatening; it involves no personal contact whatsoever. "
"How it’s written right now, you could be convicted for a misdemeanor stalking offense for a tweet that causes someone emotional distress, and then you would be prohibited from owning a firearm," Baker said.
Last month, efforts by Sens. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif. , and Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, to find a bipartisan solution broke down. Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N. Y. , accused Ernst of being "afraid of the NRA," and Ernst accused Schumer of opposing her version of the bill, which did not include the boyfriend provision, because he wanted to hurt her chances at reelection.

Donald Trump Is Bad for the Jews

Texto completo: There are things more important than your tax rate.
On Saturday Donald Trump gave a speech to the Israeli American Council in which he asserted that many in his audience were "not nice people at all," but that "you have to vote for me" because Democrats would raise their taxes.
Was he peddling an anti-Semitic stereotype, portraying Jews as money-grubbing types who care only about their wealth? Of course he was. You might possibly make excuses for his remarks if they were an isolated instance, but in fact Trump has done this sort of thing many times, for example asserting in 2015 that Jews weren't supporting him because he wasn't accepting their money and "you want to control your politicians."
Well, it's not news that Trump's bigotry isn't restricted to blacks and immigrants. What is interesting, however, is that this particular anti-Semitic cliché -- that Jews are greedy, and that their political behavior is especially driven by their financial interests -- is empirically dead wrong. In fact, American Jews are much more liberal than you might expect given their economic situation.
This is, by the way, a distinction they share with some other groups, especially Asian-Americans. More on that in a minute.
First, some background. The two major political parties in the U.S. really are very different in their policies toward the rich. President Barack Obama was hardly a radical, but when he left office the average federal tax rate on the top 1 percent was 5 percentage points higher than it had been under George W. Bush. In 2016 Trump claimed that he wouldn't do the usual Republican thing and cut taxes on the rich while trying to destroy the safety net. But he was lying.
And despite what right-wing pundits like to claim, high-income Americans are in general much more likely than others to support the Republican Party. In last year's midterms, 52 percent of voters with incomes over $ 200,000 voted Republican, compared with only 38 percent of voters with incomes under $ 50,000. The rightward tilt is especially strong at the very top; although there are a few high-profile liberal billionaires, most of the extremely wealthy are also extremely right-wing.
Given these realities, you might expect American Jews, who are in fact considerably more affluent than the average, to lean right. But they don't. In fact, only 17 percent of them voted Republican last year.
In other words, American Jews aren't the uniquely greedy, self-interested characters anti-Semites imagine them to be. But it would be foolish to make the opposite mistake and imagine that Jews are especially public-spirited; they're just people, with the same virtues and vices as everyone else. I think it was an Israeli friend who first told me that Judaism, unlike other faiths, has rarely been a religion of oppression -- but that the reason was simply lack of opportunity, a diagnosis that recent Israeli governments seem determined to confirm.
An aside: American Jews almost all support Israel, but many don't support the policies of its prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. But that's presumably a distinction Trump doesn't understand, at home or abroad.
Back to the question of what makes U.S. Jews politically different. Much of the answer is historical memory. Most of us, I think, know that whenever bigotry runs free, we're likely to be among its victims.
The Trump administration is, beyond any reasonable doubt, an anti-democratic, white nationalist regime. And while it is not (yet) explicitly anti-Semitic, many of its allies are: "Jews will not replace us" chanted the "very fine people" carrying torches in Charlottesville, Va. You have to be willfully ignorant of the past not to know where all this leads. Indeed, it's happening already: anti-Semitic incidents have soared (and my hate mail has gotten ... interesting.)
Jews aren't the only people who have figured this out. Many Asian-American voters used to support Republicans, but the group is now overwhelmingly Democratic. Indian-Americans, in particular, are like American Jews: a high-income, high-education group that votes Democratic by large margins, presumably because many of its members also realize where white nationalism will take us.
In all of this, Republicans -- not just Trump, but his whole party -- are reaping what they sowed. Their strategy for decades has been to win votes from working-class whites, despite an anti-worker agenda, by appealing to racial resentment. Trump has just made that racial appeal cruder and louder. And one has to admit that this strategy has been quite successful.
But it takes, well, chutzpah, a truly striking level of contempt for your audience, to foment hatred-laced identity politics, then turn to members of minority groups and say, in effect, "Ignore the bigotry and look at the taxes you're saving!"
And some of the audience deserves that contempt. As I said, people are pretty much the same whatever their background. There are wealthy Jews who are sufficiently shortsighted, ignorant or arrogant enough to imagine that they can continue to prosper under a white nationalist government.
But most of my ethnic group, I believe, understands that Trump is bad for the Jews, whatever tax bracket we happen to be in.

Texto completo: The A.C.L.U. asked the Supreme Court to hear an appeal from DeRay Mckesson, a Black Lives Matter activist sued by a Louisiana police officer.
WASHINGTON -- The lawsuit, a federal judge found, bordered on the delusional. A Louisiana police officer injured in a protest tried to sue the hashtag #BlackLivesMatter, which amounted, wrote Judge Brian A. Jackson of the Federal District Court in Baton Rouge, to picking a fight with an idea. "A hashtag," Judge Jackson wrote, "is patently incapable of being sued."
The officer also sued Black Lives Matter, which the judge said was also a nonstarter. It is, he wrote, "a social movement rather than an organization or entity of any sort" that could be a defendant in a lawsuit.
A third part of the lawsuit -- seeking to hold a leader of the movement liable for the officer's injuries -- reached the Supreme Court on Friday. Judge Jackson had dismissed that part of the case on First Amendment grounds, but an appeals court revived it, alarming civil rights lawyers and experts on free speech.
The officer, according to a lawsuit in which he was identified as John Doe, was injured in Baton Rouge by a demonstrator who threw a rock that broke the officer's teeth and left him with injuries to his jaw and brain. The demonstrator has not been found.
The protest, which occurred in the summer of 2016, concerned the fatal shooting of a black man, Alton B. Sterling, by two police officers. The demonstration started peacefully but turned violent.
The officer sued DeRay Mckesson, a Black Lives Matter activist, claiming, without providing details, that Mr. Mckesson had incited the violence that led to his injuries. Mr. Mckesson was present at the protest, which blocked the highway in front of the Police Department's headquarters, but he did not throw the rock that hit the officer in the head.
Judge Jackson ruled for Mr. Mckesson, saying he was protected by the First Amendment. "Liability may not be imposed merely because an individual belonged to a group, some members of which committed acts of violence," he wrote, quoting a landmark 1982 Supreme Court decision, N.A.A.C.P. v. Claiborne Hardware Co.
Allowing such lawsuits, Justice John Paul Stevens wrote for the court, would chill free speech rights and hand government officials a powerful tool to suppress the rights of black citizens "to challenge a political and economic system that had denied them the basic rights of dignity and equality that this country had fought a Civil War to secure."
The federal appeals court in New Orleans reversed the part of Judge Jackson's ruling concerning Mr. Mckesson, letting the officer's lawsuit move forward.
"Officer Doe alleges that Mckesson was negligent for organizing and leading the Baton Rouge demonstration because he 'knew or should have known' that the demonstration would turn violent," Judge E. Grady Jolly wrote for a unanimous three-judge panel of the court, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. That was enough to let the case proceed, Judge Jolly wrote.
"Mckesson should have known that leading the demonstrators onto a busy highway was most nearly certain to provoke a confrontation between police and the mass of demonstrators, yet he ignored the foreseeable danger to officers, bystanders and demonstrators, and notwithstanding, did so anyway," the judge wrote.
Garrett Epps, a law professor at the University of Baltimore, called the ruling an affront.
"The decision was not simply lawless, but insolently so," he wrote in The Atlantic.
On Friday, the American Civil Liberties Union asked the Supreme Court to hear Mr. Mckesson's appeal. David Cole, the group's legal director, said the appeals court had made a grave and dangerous mistake.
"If the law had allowed anyone to sue leaders of social justice movements over the violent actions of others," he said, "there would have been no civil rights movement."
The officer's lawsuit contended that Mr. Mckesson was liable for his injuries by failing "to calm the crowd."
The one comment from Mr. Mckesson quoted in the officer's lawsuit did not support the idea that he had incited the violence, Judge Jackson found.
The comment was part of an interview with The New York Times the day after the demonstration. "The police want protesters to be too afraid to protest," Mr. Mckesson said.
Judge Jackson said the statement was protected by the First Amendment.
"Mckesson's statement does not advocate -- or make any reference to -- violence of any kind, and even if the statement did, 'mere advocacy of the use of force or violence does not remove speech from the protection of the First Amendment,"' Judge Jackson wrote, quoting from the Claiborne Hardware decision. "This statement falls far short of being 'likely to incite lawless action,' which plaintiff would have to prove to hold Mckesson liable based on his public speech."
In its petition seeking Supreme Court review, the A.C.L.U. said the principle announced in the Claiborne Hardware case was "no relic."
"Indeed," the petition said, "the rule is of particular value to the rights of protesters -- be they same-sex marriage opponents in Berkeley, Calif., or gun control proponents in Boise, Idaho -- who take to the streets to persuade their fellow citizens to reconsider locally orthodox opinions."

Texto completo: New research indicates that access to resources, more than family structure, matters for black kids' success.
It is a near truism that the best family structure to raise a child in is a two-parent family.
We're repeatedly told by policymakers, social commentators, religious leaders and a host of others that children raised by both biological parents stand the best chance of success in life. Society routinely blames family structures that deviate from this model for many of its problems. Just think about the last time you heard someone use the term "broken home" or "single-parent household" to explain the misbehavior or misfortune of a person in your social circle.
But what if common knowledge is wrong, especially about a group whose family structures have long been used to explain their social and economic disadvantages -- black Americans?
Research I recently conducted on the relationship between family structure and children's education throws conventional "wisdom" into serious question.
Black Americans have the highest rates of single-parenthood and nonmarital births in the country, and this divergence from the two-parent family ideal is routinely implicated in the lower levels of educational attainment and higher rates of poverty and unemployment within the black community.
Ironically, in a study I recently published in the Journal of Marriage and Family, I found that living apart from a biological parent does not carry the same cost for black youths as for their white peers, and being raised in a two-parent family is not equally beneficial. In fact, using over 30 years of national data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, I tracked children's household living arrangements from birth to adulthood, and I demonstrate that family structure has a weaker relationship to the educational success of black adolescents than of white adolescents. I show that living in a single-mother family does not decrease the chances of on-time high school completion as significantly for black youths as for white youths. Conversely, living in a two-parent family does not increase the chances of finishing high school as much for black students as for their white peers.
What explains the differential returns to family structure?
Researchers have hypothesized that disparities in access to socioeconomic resources and being embedded in extended family networks might account for those differences. Because of historic and contemporary structural racism, black youths are more likely to be exposed to socioeconomically stressful environments than are white youths. Some scholars predict that the additional stress incurred by living apart from a parent is only marginally impactful, above and beyond the existing disadvantages. Other researchers point to the fact that black families tend to live closer to extended relatives than do white families and that they exchange substantially more emotional and practical support. Greater involvement in extended family networks may protect against some of the negative effects associated with parental absence from the home.
I tested these two hypotheses, and I found that both help explain racial differences in family structure effects, though the former to a much greater extent. Differences in access to socioeconomic resources such as mother's education accounted for up to nearly 50 percent of the gap in high school completion, and being embedded in extended family explained roughly 15 percent to 20 percent.
My findings coincide with those of Paula Fomby, a sociologist at the University of Michigan, and her colleagues, who found that repeated changes in family structure are less negatively consequential for black adolescents' risk behaviors than white adolescents' risk behaviors. They determined that this weaker association was also explained by black adolescents' more frequent exposure to socioeconomic stress.
The importance of socioeconomic resources makes sense when we consider the racial gaps in income and wealth between black and white two-parent families. Although in general, youths raised in two-parent families are less likely to live in poverty, black youths raised by both biological parents are still three times more likely to live in poverty than are their white peers. Additionally, black two-parent families have half the wealth of white two-parent families. So, many of the expected economic benefits of marriage and the two-parent family are not equally available to black children.
America has a long and troubled history of viewing racial inequality primarily through the lens of family structure. Recall the publication of the controversial Moynihan Report in 1965, in which government officials pointed to higher rates of "female-headed households" and "out-of-wedlock births" among black Americans as key drivers of the disadvantages they face. Today, three of the four goals of welfare reform emphasize the importance of marriage and the two-parent family for reducing poverty and improving children's well-being. These goals and the nearly billion-dollar marriage promotion initiatives that followed them are primarily aimed at low-income populations, who are disproportionately families of color.
Let me be clear: I'm not suggesting that the two-parent family is bad for children of any race or ethnicity. Indeed, scholars have noted its wide array of benefits for children, parents and communities, especially those from middle-class backgrounds.
But at a moment in which key welfare programs such as Temporary Assistance for Needy Families -- which spends up to $ 150 million dollars annually on marriage promotion initiatives -- are in need of full congressional reauthorization, blindly promoting the merits of marriage and the two-parent family is not the answer. My research shows that differences in access to resources largely explain the relationship between family structure and outcomes for black youth. If this is the case, then what deserves policy attention is not black families' deviation from the two-parent family model but rather structural barriers such as housing segregation and employment discrimination that produce and maintain racialized inequalities in family life.

Texto completo: Behavior before shooting in Pensacola described as 'strange' and 'angry'
PENSACOLA, Fla. " The Saudi air force trainee who killed three classmates at a Florida Navy base last week was a gifted student whose personality appeared to change after a trip to his native country this year, acquaintances and officials familiar with the case said Monday.
Ahmed Mohammed al-Shamrani was described as 'strange' and 'angry' in the weeks leading up to Friday's shooting rampage, but schoolmates and other acquaintances said he showed no outward sign that he was preparing to open fire inside a classroom building where he had been training to become a military aviator. The shooting, which also left eight people injured, is being treated by the FBI as a possible terrorist attack.
'He looked like he was angry at the world,' said the owner of an Indian restaurant that Shamrani and several other Saudi students regularly patronized between classes. The man, like several other businesses owners, spoke on the condition that neither his name nor the restaurant's name be revealed, citing fears of a backlash from customers.
While the FBI has not yet determined a motive for the mass shooting, investigators are building a profile of the gunman from interviews with dozens of acquaintances, including fellow Saudi students, as well as from a Twitter account that authorities say belonged to Shamrani. The gunman, who was shot dead by a sheriff's deputy responding to the shooting, is thought to have written a 'will' that was posted to the account a few hours before the rampage. In it, he blasts U.S. policies in Muslim countries. The document makes no references to any particular terrorist group.
Shamrani was among hundreds of foreign students training at the Naval Air Station in Pensacola. He had completed two years of schooling in the United States and was expected to graduate from the program in the summer.
A Saudi government official familiar with Shamrani described the 21-year-old as 'an A student' who was 'well-liked and kept to himself.' The official said the Saudi government was unaware of a formal complaint filed by Shamrani in April in which he accused an instructor of humiliating him by calling him a derogatory nickname in front of other classmates. The incident was first reported by the New York Times. The FBI on Monday declined to comment on the reported ill will between Shamrani and one of his instructors.
The depiction of Shamrani as generally mild-mannered echoed accounts given to investigators by several of Shamrani's classmates, who described him as quiet and reserved, rarely speaking during classes.
But his demeanor seemed to change following a recent home leave, several students said, with Shamrani becoming more withdrawn and often appearing sullen, officials familiar with the matter said.
Local business owners had a similar impression. The owner of one Pensacola eatery said Shamrani visited his restaurant at least once in the week before the shooting. The owner described him as 'strange,' 'quiet' and 'angry.'
'To us, he was not normal,' the businessman said. He recalled that Shamrani stared at him and his staff in an 'angry, challenging' way. But he also noted that Shamrani showed no obvious signs of religious extremism, refraining, for example, from asking if the restaurant served halal meat eaten by observant Muslims.
The owner of the Indian restaurant said Shamrani was among a group of seven or eight Saudis who would visit his establishment as often as twice a week, usually after attending Friday prayers. The men would spend freely and nearly always order the same meal, an assortment of dishes including lamb chops, chicken and shrimp.
The man specifically remembered seeing Shamrani about a week before the shooting and recalled that he had been rude with his staff.
When the Saudis failed to show up as usual on Friday, he wondered what had happened to them. He understood when he saw news on television about the shooting at the Navy base, he said.
Several of the business owners said law enforcement officials have visited them in the days since the shooting.
None of the acquaintances recalled Shamrani discussing religion or politics. But FBI officials were drawing insights from the alleged gunman's Twitter account. The typo-filled will apparently posted by Shamrani is addressed to the 'American people.' The writer says he does not dislike Americans per se " 'I don't hate you because of your freedoms,' he begins " but that he hates U.S. policies that he views as anti-Muslim and 'evil.'
'What I see from America is the supporting of Israel, which is invasion of Muslim countries,' the letter states. 'I see invasion of many countries by its troops. I see Guantánamo Bay. I see cruise missiles, cluster bombs and UAV.'
The posting has been widely circulated on Islamist websites, though no group has issued a credible claim of sponsoring or encouraging Shamrani's actions.
Also Monday, a senior defense official, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue, said the Navy was beginning to discuss the possibility that the sailors killed and wounded in Pensacola could merit Purple Heart medals and that some of them could be eligible for some sort of valor award.
The issue will depend on what determination the FBI makes about the case, the official said. The service members could be eligible for the Purple Heart if the service determines that the attack was inspired by a foreign terrorist organization, based on guidelines for the award.
In 2016, the military awarded Purple Hearts to service members who were killed or wounded in a July 2015 attack at a recruiting center in Chattanooga, Tenn.
The criteria to receive one were expanded in 2015 through congressional action to include service members wounded stateside in acts of terrorism after years of lobbying in response to two attacks on military facilities in 2009. In one, 13 people were killed and more than 30 were wounded at Fort Hood, Tex. In the other, two service members were killed in a shooting at a recruiting center in Little Rock.

Texto completo: A Massachusetts man who was among the Straight Pride counterprotesters made headlines Sunday when he wrote “Epstien Didn't Kill Himself" on a wall at the Art Basel Miami Beach fair that had displayed the now-infamous “Comedian," a piece by artist Maurizio Cattelan of a banana duct-taped to a wall.
Rod Webber, the Massachusetts man, said Monday in a phone interview that he was charged with criminal mischief for the Epstein stunt, which he said he did in part “because the world needs to wake up" to government misinformation.
The message he scrawled in red on the wall at Basel referred to deceased financier Jeffrey Epstein, who was found dead in his cell in New York in August while awaiting trial on federal charges of sex trafficking underage girls.
The death of Epstein, who counted President Trump and former President Clinton among his circle of powerful friends, unleashed a torrent of conspiracy theories from observers who maintained he was killed, even though authorities in New York determined Epstein hanged himself in his cell.
Asked Monday if he believed Epstein was killed, Webber, an artist who was in Miami over the weekend for a different art fair, said “belief is for religious fanatics," whereas he bases his opinions on empirical evidence. And that evidence is hard to come by, Webber said, since government officials are “known to lie."
Asked if he had intentionally misspelled Epstein's name in his wall screed, Webber said “[expletive] yeah," since “a good meme has got to have a mistake" to get traction.
Video footage of Webber's Basel moment quickly went viral, and in the clip he can be seen telling security personnel, “I'm gonna do another performance piece," a reference to the performance artist who had earlier eaten Cattelan's banana.
Webber later tells security, “this is the gallery where anyone can do art, right?"
His name surfaced in September in Massachusetts, when the state's highest court ruled that Boston Municipal Court Judge Richard Sinnott III had “no authority" to force prosecutors to push ahead with the prosecution of Webber for his alleged actions as a counter-demonstrator at the Straight Pride Parade in August.

Texto completo: There's been a whirlwind of Confederate statues brought down, streets renamed and other removals of references to the South's slave-holding past in recent years, but readers are prepared to draw the line at Dixie Highway.
With word that some Miami-Dade county commissioners were considering renaming that county's portion of Dixie Highway, we asked readers whether they would support renaming the highway, and if so, what name they would go with.
Of the more than 100 Facebook comments we received, 71 said the street name should stay, while nine said change it. More than a dozen offered suggestions for changing the name, but most of these were clearly trolling. The most popular suggestion was Donald J. Trump Highway, and others included Citation Way, for Dixie's numerous speed traps, and Snowflake Street, a swipe at the easily offended.
Most of the readers who wanted the street to stay the same griped about liberals, political correctness, erasing history and so on. Some suggestions were straight-up racist. But a few had more serious issues with the idea.
"What are all of the costs on changing the name on all physical signs, mapping systems, maps, documentation, legal documents, deeds, business registration records, address records, location databases, GPS systems," commented Eric Engle on our Facebook post of the story.
The idea has just been raised by a few county commissioners, so it's way too early to get a cost estimate, but renaming three local streets in Hollywood that were named for Confederate generals cost an estimated $30,000. A statewide effort to change the name of Dixie Highway would, then, cost considerably more.
Still, some readers were willing to have their tax dollars go to the effort.
"Change it. We can learn a new name. Better than Dixie would be something honoring Harriet Tubman, the Underground Railroad, Frederick Douglass, Rosa Parks, MLK Jr, Civil Rights Movement, Zora Neale Hurston, the Miccosukee, Tequesta, Bahamians who helped found/build/lead south Florida," wrote Pedro Jimenez on Facebook. "Even Highway McHighwayface would be better."
"[The] Founding Father of Florida is Juan Ponce De Leon, as you may know, and I think it should be named after him because this is Florida and he doesn't have a lot of recognition," emailed Danny Rosabal. "He founded Florida and even gave the name of our state."
Ponce de Leon also got a couple of nominations on Facebook, making him almost as popular as Trump.
We also received a couple of emails against the road being renamed not from fans of Dixie, the place, but of Dixie Highway, the actual road.
"The Dixie Highway was one of the major named auto trails that preceded the creation of numbered U.S. highways in 1926," emailed Denny Gibson. "Others that may be more familiar include the Lincoln Highway, the Jefferson Highway, and the Old Spanish Trail. The Dixie Highway connected Miami Beach in the south with Chicago and Sault Sainte Marie in the north. When the Dixie Highway Association was formed in 1915, the New York Times called the road 'a monument to celebrate the half-century of peace within the Union' and 'The Dixie Peaceway.' A sizable Facebook group of Dixie Highway fans exists whose members are always saddened by news such as what your article reports."

Need holiday shopping ideas? Here are some of the best books and DVDs of 2019

Texto completo: Many of us rely more and more on streaming services for TV shows and movies and on Kindle downloads for the latest best-sellers. But the market for DVDs, Blu-rays and good old fashioned books remains strong.
At no time is that more true than at gift-giving time.
With that in mind, we’ve put together a short list of some of our favorite TV shows and movies on DVD this year, and some books we think would make great holiday gifts.
We’ve listed the suggested retail prices, but keep in mind that many retailers offer discounts off the list price, so you’ll most often pay much less than the prices listed here.
2019 best TV shows and movies on DVD and Blu-ray
“Country Music: A Film by Ken Burns” – This spectacular 16-hour documentary on the roots of country music and its trailblazers – Jimmie Rodgers, the Carter Family, Johnny Cash, Patsy Cline and literally a hundred others – is one of the most fascinating documentaries we’ve seen. It’s the ultimate gift for a country music (or bluegrass) fan. The box set has the full 16-hour run plus three hours of bonus footage that did not air on PBS. The DVD retails for $99.99 and the Blu-ray at $129.99.
“Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood: Would You Be Mine Collection” – While we’re in the PBS world (and in the middle of a national Fred Rogers lovefest), this four-disc set is a stroll down memory lane for those who loved the iconic children’s series, and it’s still extremely relevant for kids today. You get 15 hours of content at a suggested retail price of $19.99.
“Star Trek: Discovery – Season Two” – “Star Trek” fans love this series, and the second season was even stronger than the first. The series, set in the pre-William Shatner Trekiverse, streams on CBS All Access, a pay streaming service. Not everyone subscribes, so this is a great chance to make a non-streaming Trekkie very happy. The DVD retails at $29.99 and the Blu-ray at $34.99. (Note: There are some other great CBS All Access shows on DVD that you might consider, like “The Good Fight,” which now has all three seasons available on DVD, and the first season of “Tell Me a Story,” a horror anthology series created by North Carolina native Kevin Williamson.)
“Robin Williams: Comic Genius” – A super-sized version of this Robin Williams collection was released last year, but with a super-sized price tag: $200 (the price has since come down a little). This much more manageable 5-DVD set retails at $54.95, but is usually available closer to $40 at most retailers. It includes all of Williams’ HBO specials and other bonus materials.
Disney Classics – With the debut of the streaming service Disney+, “the vault is open.” But Disney knows that not everyone can afford (or wants) streaming services. That’s why Disney still releases a few of its Signature Collection classic movies onto DVD and Blu-ray every year. These stories are timeless and adored by kids and adults. Some of this year’s big titles include “The Little Mermaid,” “Cinderella,” “Aladdin,” “101 Dalmations,” and “Sleeping Beauty.” Most of these list at around $19.99 each, but there are some special sets that could go up to around $40. Note: If you want to go beyond classics, the recent live action versions of “Aladdin” and “The Lion King” are also now on Blu-ray and DVD.
“The Wizard of Oz” in 4K UHD – 4K televisions are expected to be one of the most purchased items of the 2019 Christmas season, and those lucky folks will need some good 4K Ultra High Definition movies to watch on their crisp new screens. What could be more thrilling than flying monkeys in 4K UHD? This version, released in October, is a Blu-ray + DVD + Digital Code combo. It lists at $22.99.
“Batman Beyond: The Compete Series” – A little pricier (but very cool) is the “Batman Beyond” box set, which features all three seasons (52 episodes) of this Emmy award-winning series about a man who steals Bruce Wayne’s batsuit to avenge his father’s murder and fight crime. This special collection features a metallic Funko POP and collectible art cards, plus tons of extras. The retail price is $99.99, but you can find it around $69.99.
“Gunsmoke” and “Bonanza” – Don’t scoff. The DVD collections for these old-fashioned TV westerns are extremely popular and make great gifts for fans of classic TV. If you search these titles on Amazon, you’ll find a lot of versions that are of dubious quality, so for the best sound and picture transfer, look for the ones that are titled by season with “Volume 1” and “Volume 2.” Volumes 1 and 2 of the fifteenth season of “Gunsmoke” were just released this year, and the tenth season of “Bonanza” releases Dec. 17. Expect to pay about $30 each for the later seasons, and around $15 for earlier seasons. Bonus classic TV recommendation: A special colorized collection of “I Love Lucy” was released this year, featuring 16 classic episodes.
2019 best books for holiday gift-giving
For the literary fan: “Alice Adams: Portrait of a Writer.” Fans of literature will love Carol Sklenicka’s biography of novelist and short story writer Alice Adams, who grew up in Chapel Hill during the Great Depression and came of age during World War II. Adams wrote about women trying to find fulfillment in a man’s world and struggled in the early stages of her career. But she eventually became a regular contributor to The New Yorker and the winner of the O. Henry Special Award. This acclaimed biography gets bonus points for the local angle. It lists at $35 (release date Dec. 3).
For the history lover: “Midnight in Chernobyl: The Untold Story of the World’s Greatest Nuclear Disaster.” If someone on your shopping list loved the enthralling HBO miniseries “Chernobyl,” they can go even deeper with Adam Higganbotham’s detailed account of the 1986 nuclear power plant explosion. This was named by The New York Times as one of the best books of the year. List price is $29.99.
For the Southerner: “Southern Women” from the editors of Garden & Gun magazine. This 2019 release features essays on more than 100 Southern women (both living and passed on) who are innovators, artists and icons. You’ll recognize a good number of North Carolina women in this collection, including Ashley Christensen, Vivian Howard, Amy Sedaris, Rhiannon Giddens, Lee Smith, Michelle Dorrance, Maya Freelon and Laura Vinroot Poole. List price $32.50.
For the Michelle Obama fan: “Becoming: A Guided Journal for Discovering Your Voice.” This journal is meant as a companion for Obama’s best selling memoir, “Becoming,” and will help guide readers to write their own story by providing quotes and prompts from Obama to get them started. Suggested retail is $19.99.
For the cook: America’s Test Kitchen collection. If you’re not a pro in the kitchen, it’s hard to go wrong with any of the books from the America’s Test Kitchen collection, known for recipes that are tested to death to find the absolute best methods, and then explained in a way anyone can follow. ATK has had some particularly great releases in 2019: “The Side Dish Bible” ($35), “America’s Test Kitchen Twentieth Anniversary TV Show Cookbook” ($40) and “The Perfect Pie” ($35) are just a few of the standouts. The “Side Dish” book has more than 1,000 recipes for almost every kind of side dish you can imagine, from simple staples to special sides for special occasions. The TV show book is a collection of the best recipes from two decades of the show, plus all recipes from Season 20. It’s a great cookbook for basic dishes and the slightly more complicated. “The Perfect Pie” is pretty self-explanatory: it covers classic and modern pies, tarts, galettes and regional favorites, in addition to great instructions on how to master crusts, creams and sauces.
For the budding artist: “Draw Any Animal Book.” This book would be great for kids, with its simple, step-by-step lessons from French artist Robert Lambry on how to draw animals. These tutorials were originally published in a children’s paper in the 1920s and 1930s and then published in a book called “Les Animaux tels Qu’ils Sont” (“Animals as They Are”) almost 100 years ago. The book has found new life this year from publisher Quarto. And it’s darling. Retail price: $16.99.
For the fiction (mystery) fan: “The Last House Guest.” This is author Megan Miranda’s third novel and it was picked as the August selection for Reese Witherspoon’s book club. Though Miranda lives in North Carolina, the story is set in a small coastal town in Maine and tells the story of the longtime friendship between two women – a local and a vacationer – and what happens when one of those women is found dead. List price is $26.99.

Texto completo: MIAMI – La policía investiga este sábado si el saudí que mató a tres personas la víspera, en un tiroteo en una base militar de Florida donde recibía formación, actuó solo o contó con cómplices.
“Vamos a esclarecer esto”, afirmó el presidente Donald Trump, desde los jardines de la Casa Blanca. “Intentamos averiguar qué pasó, si se trata de una persona o de varias”.

— FBI Jacksonville (@FBIJacksonville) December 7, 2019
Según el diario The New York Times, que cita a una fuente anónima, seis ciudadanos saudíes fueron interrogados en el lugar del ataque, entre ellos dos que habían lo filmado.
El periódico añade que el tirador había enseñado videos de tiroteos masivos durante una fiesta celebrada el jueves por la noche, según una fuente conocedora de la investigación.
“Los motivos del tirador todavía se desconocen”, indicó en Twitter la oficina de Jacksonville de la policía federal estadounidense (FBI), que investiga el caso junto con una unidad especializada en antiterrorismo.
Un miembro del Ejército del Aire saudí mató a tres personas e hirió a siete el viernes cuando abrió fuego con un arma corta en una sala de clase de la base de Pensacola, antes de que la policía lo abatiera.
Antes de su ataque había tuiteado mensajes hostiles hacia Estados Unidos, informó el grupo de vigilancia de movimientos yihadistas SITE.
“Estoy contra el mal, y Estados Unidos se convirtió en su conjunto en nación del mal”, escribió el asaltante, que SITE identificó como Mohamed al Shamrani.
Según medios estadounidenses, los investigadores tratan de comprobar si el autor del ataque publicó realmente aquellos mensajes, en los que se citaba al saudí Osama bin Laden, exdirigente del grupo yihadista Al Qaida muerto a manos de militares estadounidenses en 2011.
Quince de los 19 pilotos que desviaron aviones y provocaron la muerte de unas 3,000 personas en los atentados del 11 de septiembre de 2001 en Estados Unidos eran saudíes.
Tras condenar ese tiroteo “atroz”, Riad intentó el sábado distanciarse de su ciudadano.
“Como muchos miembros del Ejército saudita, he sido formado en una base militar estadounidense y nos hemos beneficiado de ese entrenamiento (…) para combatir el terrorismo y otras amenazas, junto a nuestro aliados estadounidenses”, afirmó el sábado en Twitter el viceministro de Defensa, el príncipe Jaled bin Salmán.
Trump, que habló por teléfono con el rey Salmán sobre lo ocurrido, afirmó este sábado que los dirigentes saudíes estaban “muy afectados” por los hechos de la víspera.
“Creo que [los saudíes] ayudarán mucho a las familias”, dijo el presidente estadounidense.
El gobernador de Florida Ron DeSantis sugirió el viernes que el reino saudí debería ofrecer una indemnización a las víctimas.
“Obviamente, el gobierno de Arabia Saudita necesita aliviar a estas víctimas. Y pienso que tendrán una deuda aquí puesto que [el atacante] es uno de sus ciudadanos”, dijo.

Programs Teach Children How To Respond To Extreme Weather Threats

Autor: The New York Times.

Texto completo: Damariya Carlisle, 9, jumped as an instructor hauled a crab pot onto the steel deck of the barge docked on the Elizabeth River, a Chesapeake tributary in Norfolk, Virginia.
She marveled at the Atlantic blue crabs’ claws but worried they might pinch her. The visit was part of a fourth-grade class trip in October.
“They get to see and feel real crabs,” said Janet Goldbach Ehmer, an educator with the Elizabeth River Project who pulled the trap from the water. “It helps to create a personal connection and investment in the river.”
The Elizabeth River Project received about $500,000 for youth resiliency education as part of a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration grant program to encourage children’s resilience when faced with climate-related disasters. The grants are intended to teach young people and adults to better respond to threats like sea-level rise, severe storms, flooding, drought and extreme heat.
A main focus of the grants is to encourage students to answer: “What can I do to make myself” - as well as my family and my community - “more resilient?” said Sarah Schoedinger, a senior program manager in NOAA’s education office. “How do we rebound to something” that might leave us in a position that is “better than before?”
The Elizabeth River Project welcomes up to 200 students a day on field trips to its 120-by-32-foot learning barge. It enlists the Atlantic blue crab as a means to teach students in the area about increased flooding and sea-level rise, nudging students toward actions they can take to reduce climate impacts.
“You don’t have to grow up to do these actions,” Goldbach Ehmer tells students. “You can start these actions today.”
After attending the program, Damariya vowed to turn off lights and computers more often.
Since 2015, NOAA’s Environmental Literacy Program has awarded nearly $10 million to 22 resiliency programs across the country, in both coastal and inland states.
The programs provide education, and projects include building rain barrels, planting trees, hosting resiliency expos, collecting environmental data and interviewing community members about extreme weather events. The approach is intended to help stave off the paralysis or anxiety that may occur when confronted with climate data that may feel overwhelming.
Robin Dunbar, Elizabeth River’s deputy director of education, said, “Our whole message has not been scary” or all “gloom and doom.” She added: “I’m not trying to just push cupcakes and unicorns. We do include real science for all ages.”
Several of the programs aim to empower students to take part in community resiliency planning.
“Sometimes, when talking about big environmental issues,” Dunbar said, “there’s this idea: We need the adults to figure this out. I always come in and say, ‘Let the kids have a part in this.’”
Over the summer, middle-school boys in a hazard resiliency program in Gunnison, Colorado, that caters to rural schools hashed out how to protect their small town at the base of the Rocky Mountains from an approaching wildfire as part of a board game that incorporates hazard survival strategies.
“The foothills closest to your community have been burning for several days and your community has been blanketed with smoke,” read one of the game’s emergency updates.
The game, developed by the Boulder-based Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences, is intended to prime students to help if a real flood, drought or fire threatens their communities. The institute received about $200,000 for the project, which is estimated to reach 600 students across Colorado.
Many of the programs target underserved communities.
“For youth and their families who live in underserved communities, this is not an abstract issue,” said Ethan Lowenstein, director of the Southeast Michigan Stewardship Coalition at Eastern Michigan University. Climate change can affect young people in ways that are not immediately obvious, Lowenstein said. For example, if sports fields flood, students miss practices and games, which may affect their ability to get scholarships.
The coalition is a partner in a program called Climate Resilience From the Youth Up, which brings together high school students, educators, scientists and community members in Detroit and southeast Michigan.
Grant recipients hope student enthusiasm will spur action in neighboring communities. Watershed Management Group, an environmental nonprofit in Tucson, Arizona, engages students to design and build rain gardens, using native plants and trees and diverting stormwater runoff from school buildings to water the gardens.
Students learn about extreme weather patterns and how rain gardens mitigate extreme heat and flooding. They calculate water flows and choose materials. Students and volunteers gather, typically on a Saturday, to build the gardens.
On a recent morning, Riley Fletcher, 13, checked temperatures throughout the rain garden that stretches along a side of Drachman Montessori K-8 Magnet School in Tucson.
“When I first came to the school, it was dead dirt,” said Riley, an eighth-grader. “Nature can really be beautiful and not only look that way, but it also helps the world.”

Texto completo: Katie Hill, the former congresswoman who resigned in October after less than a year in office, writes in the New York Times that she contemplated suicide after she announced that she would step down, even running a blade across her wrists and drawing blood.
“And then I thought about my supporters. I thought about the high school students who had told me how I inspired them. I thought about the Girl Scouts whose troops I'd visited who told me they wanted to grow up to be like me, and how their parents would explain this to them, and what it would do to them. And I realized I couldn't do it."
Her resignation happened after her relationship with a campaign staffer had been exposed, and nude photos of her — “taken without my knowledge and distributed without my consent" — had been posted online. And she had contended with “wild accusations from my estranged husband about a supposed affair with a congressional staffer [which I have repeatedly denied]."
Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi did not ask her to resign, Hill writes.
Instead, “she told me I didn't have to do this, that the country needed me and that she wished I hadn't made this decision, but she respected me and what I felt I needed to do. I told her what I told everyone else when I announced my resignation: that it was the right thing to do."
At a goodbye party with freshman lawmakers, “I sat uncomfortably on a bar stool and cried as my friends went around the room and said the nicest things — things I needed to hear. Each and every one of them told me that I wasn't done. Alex — 'A.O.C.,' as people like to call her — said I was a warrior and always would be."
The next day, Hill gave her final speech in the House. She closed with: “We will not stand down. We will not be broken. We will not be silenced. We will rise, and we will make tomorrow better than today. . . . I yield the balance of my time for now, but not forever."
She finished her article in The New York Times by saying that “I don't know exactly what's ahead for me, and I know there's a lot more pain ahead. But I'm in the fight, and I'm glad it's not all over after all."

Texto completo: One word was used to epitomize the entire 20th century.
Was it "progress," to mark the march of civilization from buggies to astronauts and the iPhone?
Maybe "upheaval," to delineate genocides and civic unrest? No.
Try "jazz," to describe not only music, but the sweep and swing of the quintessential American century, and the cultural flows that invigorated it.
Who gets to decide such weighty, wordy things? The little-known American Dialect Society, or ADS, founded in 1889 and dedicated to the study of the English language in North America.
ADS has been picking a word of the year since 1990, longer than any other entity. Its members selected "jazz" from dozens of possible words in January 2000.
Now fast forward to the first week of 2020, when 300 to 400 of the society's language scholars are expected to meet in New Orleans to determine the word of 2019, as well as the even more consequential word of the decade that ends on New Year's Eve. The word of the previous decade, by the way, was "google," meaning "to search the internet."
Words of the year chosen by the ADS are not necessarily new words; they could be old ones used in new ways, said Marianna Di Paolo, emeritus linguistics professor and ADS member from the University of Utah. One example is "occupy," connected to the 2011 Occupy Wall Street protest against inequality.
During the last decade, the words of each year have bubbled out of the high-boiling soup of turbulent and tech-conscious times:
"App" in 2010. "Occupy" in 2011. "Hashtag" in 2012. "Because X" (a modern construction illustrated by the example, "Why would men wear capes? Because fashion") in 2013.
"#BlackLivesMatter" in 2014. "They" as a singular pronoun in 2015. "Dumpster fire" (describing election-related "public discourse and preoccupations") in 2016. "Fake news" in 2017. Last year, "tender-age shelter" (a euphemism referencing the facilities in which some immigrant children were separated from their parents). It beat out "the wall" (at the southern border).
The word of the decade won't necessarily be one of the yearly winners, said Ben Zimmer, the internationally known linguist and language columnist for The Wall Street Journal, who once penned the "On Language" column for The New York Times Magazine. The ADS draws up lists of candidates that may not become words of the year, but might still have a shot at being the 2010-19 representative.
Asked what he thinks the word of the decade will be, Zimmer was initially noncommittal.
"I wouldn't be surprised if 'they' as a singular pronoun does very well," he said.

Texto completo: If you are looking for the perfect gift for your most stylish friend, several new books are bound to please. While the words "icon" or "legendary" get thrown around loosely, these books all feature true masters of style in different genres: men's and women's fashion, music and art.

"Chanel: The Making
of a Collection"

Cénac weaves in the history of the iconic house with its contemporary collections. $35
"I've Seen the Future and I'm Not Going:
The Art Scene and Downtown New York
in the 1980s"
By Peter McGough
In his memoir, artist Peter McGough tells of that almost-mythical time in New York's pregentrified Lower East Side in the 1980s, when he fell into the East Village's art scene, getting to know artists like Andy Warhol, Keith Haring and Jean-Michel Basquiat, and frequenting mythic locations like Studio 54 and the Chelsea Hotel.
When McGough first moved to New York in 1980, he met and fell in love with another artist, David McDermott, and has collaborated with him ever since. McDermott and McGough became as well-known for their work in painting and photography as much as their lifestyle, which embraced a Victorian aesthetic in all they did, including wearing top hats and detachable collars and living in a converted townhouse lit only by candlelight.
Their paintings were backdated to various decades, depending on the subject, adding a highly conceptual element to the work, and their photography was produced in historical processes such as cyanotype, gum bichromate and salt prints, leading the duo to became hugely successful, and showing in three Whitney Biennials. Told with humor, McGough looks back at their professional and romantic partnership and struggles. $29.95
"Hunks & Heroes:
Jim Moore Four Decades of Fashion at GQ"
By Jim Moore

It's not simply a look book of cool covers and celebrities but also includes Moore's commentary and shows the evolution of men's style through the decades. Classic covers include a 1980s "American Gigolo"-era Richard Gere and Kanye West, who does the forward for the 352-page book. $75
"Bill Cunningham: On the Street: Five Decades of Iconic Photography"
By The New York Times
From the 1970s until his death in 2016, New York Times photographer Bill Cunningham captured New York street style almost daily. A new book by the newspaper chronicles through his eyes not only how fashion changed over nearly 50 years, but also how people and culture changed. The book focuses heavily on style - it includes essays and contributions from Anna Wintour, Guy Trebay and others - but also on important moments, such as the 1980s New York transit strike, the rise of casual Fridays and President Barack Obama's inauguration. The 384-page book contains famous Cunningham photographs that ran in The New York Times and many never-seen-before images of how he captured life. $65

Texto completo: Senators, temporarily relegated to the sidelines as the House begins impeachment proceedings against President Trump, lament inaction as legislation languishes.
WASHINGTON -- The House is an impeachment hot zone, leaving the Senate to face a cold, hard truth: Things are looking down in the upper chamber.
Temporarily relegated to the sidelines by the spectacle of impeachment dominating the House, and lulled into inactivity with legislative action at a near standstill, the Senate has become a den of ennui. Senators privately admit to being downright bored.
In marble Senate hallways that echo with emptiness compared with the crowds cramming the corridors outside House meeting rooms, senators and top aides deliver a harsh self-critique, tossing around words like "useless," "irrelevant" and "waste." They seem at loose ends as a handful of lawmakers try to hammer out a year-end spending deal in leadership office suites.
Impeachment will be on their doorstep soon enough, but for now, as the final legislative days of the year slip away, there is a dearth of real debate taking place in what is sometimes called the world's greatest deliberative body.
"There is nothing to do," lamented Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Senate Democrat who just enlisted for a re-election campaign next year in the hope the institution can get back on track.
It is not just partisan griping from Democrats. Republicans are also impatient as the Senate, under Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, has essentially become a judicial confirmation factory. (Eight more were processed this week, and others are on the way.)
Some Republicans say they are more than ready to make policy instead -- or at least in addition.
Over the summer, Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee and a close ally of Mr. McConnell, moved a bipartisan measure that takes aim at surprise medical bills and high prescription drug costs through the health committee he leads. The vote was 20 to 3. He is still waiting to bring the legislation to a vote.
"Senator McConnell has told me in the past that if I have something that I think is bipartisan and important that he will put it on the floor," Mr. Alexander said. "I would like to see him put this on the floor."
"I want to legislate," agreed Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine.
They may end up disappointed. Mr. McConnell has told colleagues there is little chance to do much beyond what he considers the essentials -- a spending package, the annual Pentagon policy bill and a new trade pact with Canada and Mexico if it comes over from the House. Other than that it is judges, judges, judges as the Senate runs out the clock on 2019.
But that has not stopped Mr. McConnell from regularly berating Democrats for being so consumed by impeachment that nothing else is getting done.
"Only in this town, only in Washington D.C., does anybody think it's O.K. for our armed forces to go unfunded and a major trade deal to go unpassed because Democrats are too busy hosting a panel of law professors to criticize President Trump on television," he said.
Democrats say it is Mr. McConnell who is the problem because he has bottled up scores of measures that have emerged from the Democratic-led House, prompting them to tag the Senate a "legislative graveyard."
"The grim reaper says all we're doing is impeachment," Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Thursday, referring to Mr. McConnell. "No, we have 275 bipartisan bills on your desk."
Given his ideological differences with Democrats, Mr. McConnell is unlikely to be in a rush to put House-passed bills on the floor. But he could move ahead on bipartisan measures like the health bill sponsored by Mr. Alexander if he chose to do so.
A Senate leadership aide said that when Mr. McConnell points the finger at Democrats, it is about their focus on impeachment over the overdue spending and Pentagon bills. The aide, speaking on the condition of anonymity to describe Mr. McConnell's strategy, said that the majority leader was holding off on the health care measure to give Mr. Alexander running room to strike a bipartisan, bicameral deal that would lead to quicker passage rather than a drawn-out debate on the floor.
Republicans say that Mr. McConnell has welcomed Democratic resistance to taking up the spending measures without an overall deal because it has freed him to devote the Senate to his top priority -- confirming judges to lifetime federal appointments. Including the eight confirmed this week, the three-year total for the Trump era is now 170 and counting. The majority leader lined up more votes in the coming days on disputed nominees, drawing renewed criticism from Democrats.
"Voting for a series of largely radical, callow nominees is not what the country needs or what satisfies the vast majority of senators who came to Washington to legislate," said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader.
The intense focus on nominations is evident in new figures compiled by Senate Democrats, who said that in 2019, there were 287 votes in the chamber related to nominations, compared with 98 regarding legislation. (Republicans blame Democrats for forcing excessive procedural votes on nominees.) Democrats also counted 70 days with votes related only to nominations, 29 days with votes strictly on legislation, and 19 days with votes on both legislation and nominations.
The focus on nominations has yielded a Republican overhaul of the federal courts, but it robs lawmakers of both parties of the chance to shape legislation through amendments and floor consideration. And while the scarcity of legislative fights has its advantages -- senators are not being forced to cast politically risky votes -- it also deprives them of the opportunity for a give-and-take over policy, something senators formerly took pride in.
"There is a sense we are not doing as much as we could, we are not getting the sense of satisfaction and accomplishment, " said Senator Jack Reed, Democrat of Rhode Island. "That was never every day. It took a while, but we got something done."
With the Senate slowed to a crawl, lawmakers heard a plea this week from Senator Johnny Isakson, the popular Georgia Republican who is retiring at the end of the year because of health reasons, to try to come together.
"Being bipartisan doesn't mean a Democrat and Republican talk to each other every once in a while," he said in a floor speech attended by senators from both parties. "It means this: Two people come together who probably have differences -- probably have a lot of differences -- but they find a way to get to the end of the trail, where there is the possibility of a solution, and then they do the things they have to do to get to that solution. America today is built on people who found a way to get to that end of the solution."
Despite the warm applause for Mr. Isakson and his sentiments, it was clear that his colleagues would not quickly fulfill those expectations.
"There just doesn't seem to be a whole lot of bipartisan cooperation right now," said Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas.
Hope springs eternal among lawmakers that the Senate could regain its former distinction as an active legislative body. They just don't know when.
"I have this sense," said Mr. Alexander, who is retiring at the end of 2020, "that there is going to be a collective feeling around here -- and I'm not sure when it will come -- that there is more life to judges and impeachment."

IDEA FOR CANDIDATES FORUM HERE STARTED IN THE NATION'S CAPITAL HOPEFULS TO OUTLINE STANCE ON EDUCATION

Texto completo: The conversation that spawned the idea to hold a forum on education for Democratic presidential candidates in Pittsburgh took place months ago at the American Federation of Teachers building in Washington, D.C.
But grassroots organizations, teachers unions and public school advocacy groups in Pennsylvania and around the country have for years been laying the groundwork that they hope will make education a key issue in the 2020 presidential race and beyond.
"You see the difference about the importance of public education right now," said Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers. "As the world gets more complicated and complex, and there's such division outside of schools, public schools become even more important."
The Public Education Forum 2020, being held Saturday at the David L. Lawrence Convention Center in Downtown, will provide an opportunity for many of the leading candidates to air their stance on some of the major issues facing public education today.
The forum was convened by an 11-organization coalition of groups that included the American Federation of Teachers, the Pittsburgh Federation of Teachers and social justice advocacy group One PA, among others. Candidates scheduled to appear at the forum include Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, former Vice President Joe Biden, South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar and businessman Tom Steyer.
The idea to hold a forum was sparked during a conversation in early spring in Ms. Weingarten's office in Washington with a group of public education advocates.
They decided to brainstorm ways to bring public education issues to the forefront of the 2020 presidential race, and they eventually came up with hosting a forum where candidates could hear from a variety of stakeholders - teachers, parents, students, unions and more - and at the same time talk about their own views.
One of the people who was at the meeting was Jitu Brown, the national director of the Journey for Justice Alliance, a grassroots group based in Chicago with partners nationwide that calls for education equity.
The Journey for Justice Alliance promotes student-centered school climates, sustainable community schools and teacher diversity, as well as more accountability for charter schools, limits on using standardized tests as measures of school success and ending zero-tolerance policies. The organization launched in 2012 in an attempt to combat what members saw as the growing problem of school privatization.
The Journey for Justice Alliance collaborates with student, parents and teacher groups, as well as the likes of the NAACP and Black Lives Matter. As planning for the forum began, Mr. Brown approached the leadership of many of those organizations to ask for their involvement.
"We understood that together we represented millions," Mr. Brown said, "and that divided, we'll win victories here and there, but united, we can change how education operates in the United States."
Mr. Brown said bringing together so many organizations with different needs - and that often disagree on issues - will force the candidates to answer questions from those who do not always have a voice: the teacher worried about resources being depleted from her school, the parent who's had to send her child to three schools in three years, the student who's late to class because he had to wait in line to go through the metal detectors.
Though Mr. Brown has been outspoken about the privatization of schools being pushed by Betsy DeVos, President Donald Trump's education secretary, he said Democrats are also to blame for the decline in public education. He said he believes that there would be no Betsy DeVos without Arne Duncan, an Obama administration secretary of education who pushed for standardized tests and promoted charter schools.
Mr. Brown said he feels as though Democrats have abandoned President Lyndon Johnson's Title I under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 that aimed to close the skills gap between low-income students and middle-class or more affluent students. He said he also feels as though the Supreme Court's ruling on Brown v. Board of Education, which banned segregation in schools, never has been fully realized.
He hopes the forum will open a conversation about education equity that will continue as the election approaches.
"We want a presidential candidate to have to talk to the full breadth of the education justice movement, and then also that education justice becomes a wedge issue in the presidential election," he said.
Why Pittsburgh?
Another matter as the forum came together was agreeing on a location. Chicago, Detroit and Boston were all under consideration, but the organizers settled on Pittsburgh for a number of reasons.
First, Pennsylvania is a battleground state that Mr. Trump won in 2016. Pittsburgh and Western Pennsylvania are important areas for Democrats to have a high rate of success if they want to reclaim the state in 2020.
Pennsylvania also deserves credit for pushing education justice, according to Mr. Brown. OnePA, in particular, has been leading the charge for education equity. For example, members of OnePA last week urged the Pittsburgh Public Schools to shift funding away from police and security and allocate more money toward mental health services for students.
"Based off of the work that we're doing here locally, we are actually looked at as a city that is moving forward to more progressive education policies, specifically around ending the school-to-prison pipeline and creating new sustainable community schools, [and] making sure that we're not privatizing our education by supporting new charter school applications," said Angel Gober, the Western Pennsylvania director of OnePA.
Pittsburgh also "represents diverse students and families like in so many other places across the country," Ms. Weingarten said. "Basically, working people who see public schools and college as a way of achieving the American Dream."
Nina Esposito-Visgitis, president of the Pittsburgh Federation of Teachers, said she is "proud" that the city is getting the chance to host the forum.
"It is a lot of work, but we're really very, very excited," Ms. Esposito-Visigitis said. "We're very excited to of course show off our city, and show off the work of our local and the work we do here in education."

Texto completo: For the past 30 years, the Democratic presidential candidate who received the most primary support from black voters won the party's nomination. All but one " John F. Kerry in 2004 " won the popular vote in the general election. But developments in the current Democratic contest, including former vice president Joe Biden's continued popularity among black voters and Sen. Kamala D. Harris's departure, show that the black electorate remains widely misunderstood. Here are five myths about the voting bloc that may be especially relevant for the 2020 election.
Myth No. 1 Black voters are liberal. One of the defining phenomena of contemporary American electoral politics is the black electorate's large and enduring support for the Democratic Party, which-has concurrently moved leftward: Its presidential candidates have received-an average-of nearly 90 percent of the black vote for the past six decades. Many conclude that black voters' liberal preferences, carried over from economic and racially progressive policies of the civil rights movement and Jesse Jackson's presidential campaigns of 1984 and 1988, led this shift. MSNBC host Joy-Ann Reid wrote that Jackson's radical liberalism helped pave the way for Bernie Sanders's rise. -And the Black Lives Matter movement tried to push Hillary Clinton left, changing liberal politics in the process. As a result, senior politics writer David Catanese-held-in U.S. News - World Report, 'the most liberal list of policy positions' would be Sanders's 'best gambit to win over African Americans.'-And Noah Millman made the case in the Week that Sen. Elizabeth Warren's liberal economic populism may be the key to winning black voters.
But black voters' support of Democratic candidates is a function of-electoral pragmatism-" voting in a risk-averse fashion to preserve gains, instead of ideologically in hopes of immediate transformative change " not devotion to left-wing ideology. In surveys, more than half of black Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents-prefer-a public option for health care over Medicare-for-all, and two-thirds of black Americans-favor-charter schools and choice programs, which stray from party orthodoxy.
Only 28 percent of black Democrats-consider themselves-liberal, according to the Pew Research Center, while 70 percent identify as moderate or conservative. And black liberal Democrats-constitute-just 17 percent of the left wing of the party, Gallup found. Black voters' political diversity is more visible in local and state politics: A-2007 study of direct-democracy referendums in-California found-that black voters were split between the conservative and liberal positions, for example. And Republicans have succeeded in appealing to moderate and conservative black voters in state races, as Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan-did in his 2018 reelection campaign, when he won more than a quarter of the bloc.
Myth No. 2 Black candidates matter most to black voters. When black candidates run for office, observers assume that they can rely on group solidarity. The Los Angeles Times-noted that Harris and Sen. Cory Booker were 'banking on racial pride' to win black voters. When former Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick entered the primary race last month, Bloomberg News-reported, 'As an African American, Patrick could diminish Biden's strength with black voters.'
It's certainly true that black voters support black Democratic candidates at higher rates, often in terms of both-turnout-and-vote share. But analysis of past elections and campaigns shows that black voters have never prioritized simple descriptive representation over-other factors, like party affiliation, campaign viability, candidate electability, preexisting relationships with the black community and a sense of authenticity. Sen. Barack Obama had to prove his viability by winning white Democrats in Iowa before his black support materialized, a hurdle that many black candidates, from Shirley Chisholm and Al Sharpton to Booker and Harris, have not managed to clear. As several black voters-recently told-the New York Times: 'Representation is not enough.'
Myth No. 3 Trump can win black voters in significant numbers. While campaigning in Michigan in 2016, Donald Trump-claimed, 'At the end of four years, I guarantee you that I will get over 95 percent of the African American vote.' That assertion is clearly outlandish. But it has long been a Republican axiom that winning 1 in 5 black voters is-the magic number-for party dominance. Trump and the GOP point to low black unemployment and federal prison reform as winning-messages.
Yet Trump will be fortunate to get to half of that 20 percent threshold in 2020. The 8 percent of black voters he won in 2016 was certainly more than John McCain and Mitt Romney received in 2008 and 2012 while facing Obama's historic candidacy. Still, between 1968 and 2004, Republican presidential nominees-averaged-nearly 12-percent of the black vote, and Trump underperformed each one. Meanwhile, Gallup reports that just 10 percent of black Americans-approve-of the job Trump is doing, and more than 3 in 4 have an-unfavorable-view of him, according to a recent Economist/YouGov poll. The party's relative silence after the president's comments about-black countries, majority-black cities like-Baltimore, and black-athletes-and-women-appears set to play a-larger role-in black voters' choices than specific policy proposals.
Myth No. 4 Democrats lose elections because of black voters' apathy. In 2016, a seven-point drop in black voter turnout was perceived to have cost Clinton the election. Political commentators often cite black voters' 'enthusiasm gap' as the primary reason for low turnout. After last month's elections, an NBC headline claimed, 'Democratic wins come with a warning sign: Low African American voter turnout,' suggesting that unless black voters are energized, Democrats cannot prevail.
But the 7 million to 9 million voters, mostly white, who backed Trump after supporting Obama four years earlier played a larger role in Clinton's loss than lower black turnout. And state voter-suppression measures " from ID laws to longer lines " had become more prevalent, targeting black Americans 'with almost surgical precision,' according to a federal court. Subpar outreach and mobilization efforts, coupled with voter suppression, hurt Democrats more than an uninterested black electorate.
Finally, higher black turnout does not equate to Democratic wins: Though it increased in 1984, 2000 and 2004, Republican nominees won the White House.
Myth No. 5 Black voters won't vote for gay candidates. South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg's support among black voters has been dismal: at 2 percent nationally in the Economist/YouGov poll and at less than 1 percent in South Carolina, where black voters are nearly two-thirds of the primary electorate.-A much-publicized rationale for this lack of support, largely based on an internal campaign memo, is that black voters can't-get past-the fact that Buttigieg is openly gay. Rep. James E. Clyburn (D-S.C.) remarked-that 'there's no question' Buttigieg's sexuality is a problem for older black voters. These sentiments are grounded in the social conservatism and strong religiosity often found in parts of black America, demonstrated most publicly during state referendums and lawmaking on same-sex marriage between 2000 and 2015. For example, black parishioners in North Carolina helped pass a 2012 measure to define marriage as between a man and woman, and mobilized in Maryland against a 2012 statute legalizing same-sex marriage.
But Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot, who is black and gay, -won-thanks to black voters " despite the open acknowledgment that if she'd kissed her partner in a black church, she'd be asked to leave. -Social conservatism does not have a large effect on black Americans'-voting behavior, according to research published in Social Science Quarterly. In fact, black voters-view-Buttigieg about as favorably as white and Hispanic voters do, and fewer black voters-view him unfavorably, according to the Economist/YouGov poll. A-range of issues-impairs his ability to win black support (including lack of endorsements from prominent black officials): Homophobia probably isn't one of them.

Paul Krugman: Why is Trump a tariff man?

Texto completo: Almost exactly one year has passed since Donald Trump declared, “I am a Tariff Man.” Uncharacteristically, he was telling the truth.
At this point I’ve lost count of how many times markets have rallied in the belief that Trump was winding down his trade war, only to face announcements that a much-anticipated deal wasn’t happening or that tariffs were being slapped on a new set of products or countries. Over the past week it happened again: Markets bet on an outbreak of trade peace between the U.S. and China, only to get body slammed by Trump’s declaration that there might be no deal before the election and by his new tariffs on Brazil and Argentina.
So Trump really is a Tariff Man. But why? After all, the results of his trade war have been consistently bad, both economically and politically.
I’ll offer an answer shortly. First, however, let’s talk about what the Trump trade war has actually accomplished.
A peculiar aspect of the Trump economy is that while overall growth has been solid, the areas of weakness have come precisely in those things Trump tried to stimulate.
Remember, Trump’s only major legislative accomplishment was a huge tax cut for corporations that was supposed to lead to a surge in investment. Instead, corporations pocketed the money, and business investment has been falling.
At the same time, his trade war was supposed to shrink the trade deficit and revive U.S. manufacturing. But the trade deficit has widened, and manufacturing output is shrinking.
The truth is that even economists who opposed Trump’s tax cuts and tariffs are surprised by how badly they’re working out. The most commonly given explanation for these bad results is that Trumpian tariff policy is creating a lot of uncertainty, which is giving businesses a strong incentive to postpone any plans they might have for building new factories and adding jobs.
In that case, however, why doesn’t Trump do what the markets keep wrongly expecting him to do, and call it quits? His continuing tariff obsession seems especially strange given growing evidence that it’s hurting him politically.
It’s important to realize that Trumpian protectionism wasn’t a response to a groundswell of public opinion. As best as I can tell from the endless series of interviews with white guys in diners — who are, we all know, the only Americans who matter — these voters are driven more by animosity toward immigrants and the sense that snooty liberals look down on them than by trade policy.
And public opinion seems to have become far less protectionist even as Trump has raised tariffs, with the percentage of Americans saying that free trade agreements are a good thing as high as it’s ever been.
So Trump’s trade war is losing, not gaining, support. And one recent analysis finds that it was a factor hurting Republicans in the 2018 midterm elections, accounting for a significant number of lost congressional seats.
Nevertheless, Trump persists. Why?
One answer is that Trump has long had a fixation on the idea that tariffs are the answer to America’s problems, and he’s not the kind of man who reconsiders his prejudices in the light of evidence. But there’s also something else: U.S. trade law offers Trump more freedom of action — more ability to do whatever he wants — than any other policy area.
The basic story is that long ago — in fact, in the aftermath of the disastrous Smoot-Hawley tariff of 1930 — Congress deliberately limited its own role in trade policy. Instead, it gave the president the power to negotiate trade deals with other countries, which would then face up-or-down votes without amendments.
It was always clear, however, that this system needed some flexibility to respond to events. So the executive branch was given the power to impose temporary tariffs under certain conditions: import surges, threats to national security, unfair practices by foreign governments. The idea was that nonpartisan experts would determine whether and when these conditions existed, and the president would then decide whether to act.
This system worked well for many years. It turned out, however, to be extremely vulnerable to someone like Trump, for whom everything is partisan and expertise is a four-letter word. Trump’s tariff justifications have often been self-evidently absurd — seriously, who imagines that imports of Canadian steel threaten U.S. national security? But there’s no obvious way to stop him from imposing tariffs whenever he feels like it.
And there’s also no obvious way to stop his officials from granting individual businesses tariff exemptions, supposedly based on economic criteria but in fact as a reward for political support. Tariff policy isn’t the only arena in which Trump can practice crony capitalism — federal contracting is looking increasingly scandalous — but tariffs are especially ripe for exploitation.
So that’s why Trump is a Tariff Man: Tariffs let him exercise unconstrained power, rewarding his friends and punishing his enemies. Anyone imagining that he’s going to change his ways and start behaving responsibly is living in a fantasy world.

Texto completo: GENEVA, N.Y. - Across the country, hundreds of kinds of apples were meticulously developed by orchardists over the last couple of centuries and then, as farms and groves were abandoned and commercial production greatly narrowed the number of varieties for sale, many were forgotten.
Some of this horticultural biodiversity, though, has been nurtured by dedicated growers who want to preserve the forgotten flavors and other traits of apples from the past. For example, some of the best apples ever developed for baking pies are no longer grown commercially, experts say, but are still thriving in heirloom orchards.
“They are a piece of our history as a variety and part of our cultural identity,” said Mark Richardson, director of horticulture at the Tower Hill Botanic Garden in Boylston, Massachusetts. “But also some of these varieties may be important for breeding the next generation. They are an insurance policy against a catastrophe.”
A burgeoning threat is coming for apples, though, both of the historical varieties and the popular ones grown in the orchards today. A disease called fire blight, easily managed for a long time in apple and pear orchards, is becoming more virulent as the climate changes and as growers alter the way the trees are configured to produce higher yields. Some researchers say newer varieties may be more vulnerable, too.
It is another example of threats to the nation’s fruit crops, as citrus greening has hammered Florida’s orange groves and a fungus called Tropical Race 4 has devastated the world’s banana plantations.
“Commercial apples are getting hit fairly hard by fire blight,” said Kerik D. Cox, a plant pathologist who has studied the disease for a decade at Cornell College of Agriculture and Life Sciences here. “And the intensity of it appears to be new.”
As they walk down a row of small and thin apple trees, with large dark red apples hanging on them like Christmas bulbs, Cox and a graduate student, Anna Wallis, point out a shriveled, dark brown branch on one of them.
The blight - caused by the bacterium erwinia amylovora - is native to the United States and predates the introduction of apple trees to North America. Apple and pear growers have long managed the disease, by trimming dead branches and in recent decades, spraying antibiotics like Streptomycin. But the blight is becoming resistant to the antibiotics, some say, and has become more aggressive, wiping out hundreds or even thousands of trees in some places.
The blight is spreading to places where it had not been seen before, into New York’s Champlain Valley and parts of Maine, for example.
Tower Hill Botanic Garden was forced in November to raze its orchard of 238 heirloom trees - two each of 119 antique varieties. The orchard is dedicated to apples developed in this country, Europe and elsewhere long ago.
One of the varieties, the Roxbury Russet, dates back to the mid-17th century, and is believed to be the oldest apple variety cultivated in the United States.
In an effort to keep the ancient lineage of the orchard from disappearing, the scionwood - cuttings from recent aboveground growth - was grafted onto new blight-resistant root stock. The new tree grafts will grow for a year at an orchard in Maine, and then will be returned for planting in 2021.
Orchards like the one at Tower Hill - there are fewer than a dozen in the country, experts say - have been likened to the Svarlbard Global Seed Vault, a concrete facility storing nearly 1 million seed species on the side of a mountain on a Norwegian island.
The genetics of these trees may exist nowhere else and could someday be used to create new commercial varieties because of their flavor or resistance to disease and pests. Keeping the actual trees alive by growing successive generations through cloning and grafting is the only way to assure their lineage. That is because a seed from a particular tree may not contain all of the traits of the variety because one of the parents is unknown.
Tower Hill had never seen fire blight during the bloom season, which provides a potent pathway for infection, until 2011. “We get a combination of weird and tragic weather, these days, variable and unpredictable,” Cox said.
Unusual spikes in temperature and more wet weather form ideal conditions for the bacterium. While May temperatures in this part of the Northeast used to rise more gradually and more uniformly, that dynamic started changing about 20 years ago and now some days in that month can spike into the 70s, Cox said. In May 2010, temperatures soared into the 80s.
“Fire blight enters the tree through the flower and if it lands on a flower in bloom with temps in the 60s, it can’t enter,” Richardson of Tower Hill said. “But if it’s over 75, the conditions are right for the spore to enter the flower and get into the vascular system and it moves through the orchard faster.”
Honeybees and other insects then spread the disease as they pollinate apple blossoms. At warmer temperatures, fire blight is much more virulent. “It has the ability to kill a tree in a single season,” Richardson said.
What makes the ecology of the disease even more challenging to solve and address is that while a warmer world is a big part of the emerging problem, there are other factors that may be contributing to ideal conditions for an outbreak.
Apple orchards these days are a very different creature than they used to be. “People climbing apple trees and harvesting fruit with ladders, that’s gone,” Cox said. “It’s now about making an apple like a grape, where you can walk by and pick the fruit right off the tree.”
Many modern commercial apple trees are planted in what’s called a high density trellis system. They top out at about 6 to 8 feet and are narrow, like a sapling. Yet, fertilizers can push this waifish modern tree to grow about 50 full-size apples, compared to as many as 300 or so on the old-style trees. But instead of some 300 trees to an acre spaced about 10 feet apart, trees are planted 18-24 inches apart and there are 1,500 or so trees to an acre.
The trellis-style orchard increases product and profit. A few decades ago, apple growers harvested 200 to 300 bushels of apples to the acre. The goal now is 2,000 bushels an acre, Cox said.
The trellis configuration makes it difficult to manage fire blight. “The old-style trees that we used to grow were big and had tons of branches and the bacteria couldn’t move through the tree very well,” said George Sundin, a plant pathologist at Michigan State University, where fire blight is also a growing problem. In these new trees, “the branches are smaller and it’s a short distance from the branch to the tree and down to the roots.”
Managed by cutting out infection, fire blight rarely killed trees in the old days, but now can wipe out hundreds or thousands in a month or two. It can spread from orchard to orchard through the wind or by insects carrying the disease.
Another contributing factor may be that the new apple trees are not as resistant to disease. “They are the equivalent of a caged chicken, planting them in crowded conditions and pushing them with nutrients to grow 50 or more apples to a tree,” Cox said.
And because many more trees are being planted, tree growers are rushing to fill orders. “Nurseries can’t grow trees fast enough and quality is compromised,” Cox said.
Moreover, modern varieties may also play a role. “So is it primarily climate change, or is it that they are packed together?” Cox asked. “Or is it the new varieties - such as Evercrisp and Gala - which may be more susceptible? That’s what we are trying to find out.”

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - The White House signaled Friday that it did not intend to mount a defense of President Donald Trump or otherwise participate in the House impeachment proceedings, sending a sharply worded letter to Democrats condemning the process as "completely baseless" and urging them to get it over with quickly.
"House Democrats have wasted enough of America's time with this charade," the White House counsel, Pat Cipollone, wrote in a letter to the House Judiciary Committee chairman, Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y. "You should end this inquiry now and not waste even more time with additional hearings."
The letter did not explicitly say what Mr. Trump's legal team planned to do, but it ended by quoting the president, saying that the House should hold a swift vote on impeachment to speed the way for a trial in the Republican-controlled Senate, where White House officials believe Mr. Trump will have a better chance to mount a defense. People close to the White House said that it would take major concessions by Democrats for that position to change.
That timetable also suits House Democrats, who have signaled they want to move quickly to impeach Mr. Trump before leaving Washington for Christmas.
The White House position most likely clears the way for House committees to debate and approve impeachment articles as soon as next week, allowing a vote by the full House by Dec. 20, the final legislative day of the year. And it all but ensures that the president's defense will not be heard before early January, when the Senate is expected to begin a trial to hear whatever case the House presents.
"Adopting articles of impeachment would be a reckless abuse of power by House Democrats and would constitute the most unjust, highly partisan and unconstitutional attempt at impeachment in our nation's history," Mr. Cipollone wrote.
The White House stance is a departure from impeachments past. When the House moved to charge Presidents Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton, their lawyers fully participated in the proceedings, including presenting lengthy defenses before the Judiciary Committee.
In the case of Mr. Trump, the president and his allies have complained for months that they deserve legal representation in the inquiry. Now they are refusing an invitation to avail themselves.
House Republicans, who are shouldering the weight of defending Mr. Trump in the White House's absence, took a different approach in a letter of their own Friday. Rep. Doug Collins, R-Ga., the top Republican on the panel, asked Mr. Nadler to allow testimony by at least eight witnesses who have become outsize figures in the president's defense "to provide context and transparency about the underlying facts at issue in this 'impeachment inquiry.'"
First on the list was Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, whose investigation is likely to form the basis for impeachment articles. Mr. Schiff's team concluded that Mr. Trump sought to pressure Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, his son Hunter Biden and a theory that Democrats conspired with Ukraine to interfere in the 2016 election, withholding as leverage a coveted White House meeting and $391 million in military aid.
Mr. Collins argued Mr. Schiff should have to face questions about his work.
Others on the list included the anonymous CIA whistleblower whose complaint about Mr. Trump's dealings with Ukraine prompted the impeachment inquiry, along with any government officials whose accounts informed his account. Republicans want to hear from Hunter Biden, who sat on the board of a Ukrainian energy company while his father was vice president; Hunter Biden's business partner; and a former Democratic National Committee staff member who news reports have indicated had contact with Ukrainian officials in Washington during the 2016 campaign.
"That will be necessary to ensure at least a modicum of fairness and due process is afforded to the president, and, more importantly, the American electorate," Mr. Collins wrote.
Three powerful Senate Republicans seemed to have similar targets in mind Friday. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., chairman of the Homeland Security Committee; Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., chairman of the Judiciary Committee; and Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, chairman of the Finance Committee, jointly requested testimony and documents from a former DNC aide, Alexandra Chalupa, and a former Ukrainian Embassy official.
"Contrary to the popular narrative in the 'mainstream media' that Ukrainian involvement in the 2016 election has been debunked, or 'no evidence exists,' there are many unanswered questions that have festered for years," Mr. Johnson said in a statement. "Those who are curious have a legitimate and understandable desire to know if wrongdoing occurred."
Mr. Nadler had set a deadline of Friday evening for the White House to state whether it intended to mount a defense before the panel and for Republicans to recommend witnesses. Democrats are almost certain to vote down the requests from Mr. Collins.
The missives came the day after Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced that she was directing senior Democrats to begin drafting impeachment articles against Mr. Trump.
The Judiciary Committee held its first impeachment hearing this week, convening a panel of constitutional scholars to discuss the history and meaning of impeachment. The panel will hold another session Monday to receive and debate the findings from the House Intelligence Committee's two-month investigation of Mr. Trump's attempts to pressure Ukraine to investigate his political rivals.

Texto completo: A minister writes, "Some things are so clearly wrong they should never be condoned or justified."
To the Editor:
Re "Captive of C.I.A. Sketched Agony of His Torture," by Carol Rosenberg (front page, Dec. 5):
Ms. Rosenberg and The New York Times are to be lauded for the courageous article starkly describing the torture of the man known as Abu Zubaydah.
Much like the death penalty debate, the question is not about whether anyone's deeds deserve such treatment, but rather what killing and torturing say about us, as a society. Some things are so clearly wrong they should never be condoned or justified.
In a season of deep national soul-searching concerning our moral character, the capacity to acknowledge past wrongs is a hopeful sign, especially when viewed against the backdrop of vainglorious posturing on the part of those in power.

Austin Bay: Trump employing psychological feints for security purposes

Texto completo: Three years ago, Donald Trump began a rhetorical offensive targeting the governments of NATO nations that chronically failed to meet their allied defense financial commitments. With bombastic huff, Trump intimated that allies pay their share or America might walk.
It’s 2019. Few NATO members currently meet the 2% GDP defense commitment. However, several once-laggard NATO nations have increased military spending, and the alliance is stronger for it. The era of blithe freeloading has ended. Cheapskates like Germany pay a price in lost prestige. America not only hasn’t walked; it is modernizing its forces.
<img class="size-medium wp-image-2656846" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2019/02/Austin-Bay-Color-300x190.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="190" />
Earlier this year, President Trump began grousing about endless wars and publicly mulled removing U.S. military forces from Syria. Then, in mid-October, he abruptly ordered military advisers to leave northern Syria, a predicate to a complete U.S. skedaddle. Trump’s critics cratered. Syria’s civil war is a dirty, fractious bloodbath where regional and global powers collide amid homicidal tribes. With the U.S. gone, Turkish forces would slaughter Kurds.
Ah, but in late October, American commandos killed the truly evil Islamic State group leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who was hiding in a Syrian village not far from the Turkish border. The Pentagon had spent months planning the raid. Alas, The New York Times reported Trump’s withdrawal decision “disrupted the meticulous planning and forced Pentagon officials to press ahead with a risky, night raid …”
Don’t buy that. The raid was intricate and its execution meticulous. Special operations helicopter crews train to operate at night. Nighttime is commando time. Turkey knew U.S. helicopters were flying along the border and didn’t mention it.
Now in December 2019, U.S. military forces remain in southern Syria. Fighting continues in the north between Turkish forces and various Syrian factions. But in retrospect, Trump’s withdrawal antics look more than a bit like strategic political camouflage and psychological preparation that gave the raid that killed an operational boost.
Trump’s withdrawal bombast sent a psychological message to Islamic State terrorists: The coward Americans are going home. We don’t need to worry about Delta Force.
I have sketched two cases where President Trump likely employed diplomatic and psychological feints to advance American security interests. Though Trump’s critics won’t admit it publicly, the NATO example is documented. The al-Baghdadi example is speculative.
But why would a Pentagon leaker tell The New York Times Trump had “disrupted” the raid? I often served as a plans officer during tours of active duty with the U.S. Army, and I have an answer to that question: so the Pentagon could use the ruse to mask a future operation.
If The New York Times is willing to consciously or unwittingly provide media cover for future American commando raids that remove from planet Earth mass-murdering rapist terrorists like al-Baghdadi, good deal.
Though every operation is different, Trump appears to be using a modified “goodbye NATO” shtick on the U.N. The U.N. is a morass of a mess. However, U.S. dollars talk, and so do U.S. Air Force transport aircraft that support U.N. peacekeeping, emergency relief and developmental aid operations.
Trump is using diplomatic and psychological feints to gain operational leverage in the U.S.-China trade war. Critics bewail his compliments of Chinese President Xi Jinping. Xi is a communist murderer running a prison state. But consider the big game. Personal compliments can serve as psychological political buffers. A personal door to dialogue with Beijing remains available as Washington tightens the economic screws.
Which led me to mulling the psychological targets of Trump’s threat to treat Mexican drug cartels as terrorist organizations.
Actually, designating Mexican cartels as terrorist organizations could have severe political consequences for U.S.-Mexico bilateral relations.
The threat bluntly tells the Mexican government to improve its own security efforts in northern Mexico.
However, the threat clearly targets the sick psyches of the drug lords running the cartels. Ambush Americans on Mexican highways and they pay. Jail? No. A visit from Delta Force and its dogs, or a 2,000-pound Air Force joint direct attack munition.
Trump is suggesting narco-comandantes reconsider their criminal behavior.

'Reeks of dog-whistle politics': Professors weigh in on Bevin 'harvest' comments

Texto completo: Gov. Matt Bevin was using coded language to refer to minority voters when he blamed his election loss on liberals "harvesting votes" in urban areas, political experts say.
"You often hear that when people speak about minority communities, they will say 'urban areas' and such," said Dewey Clayton, a political science professor at the University of Louisville. "And they use that term 'urban' almost to be synonymous with African American voters."
On Wednesday, Bevin appeared on several radio shows and said he had trouble in his reelection bid against Gov.-elect Andy Beshear because Democrats increased voter turnout in urban centers such as Louisville, Lexington and Covington.
"The left, those who think of a different ideological bent, they are getting so good at harvesting votes in the urban communities," Bevin said, pointing to "densely populated" areas like college campuses and public housing complexes.
Ballot harvesting, or collecting and submitting absentee or mail-in ballots by voters or workers, is essentially illegal in Kentucky. Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes, whose office oversaw the November election, said Bevin's comments had "no basis in fact or reality."
Elizabeth Kuhn, a spokeswoman for the Bevin administration, did not immediately respond to a phone call and email Thursday seeking comment.
Clayton said he isn't sure of Bevin's intentions but was "a little surprised to see that language being used."
But he said Bevin's comment "reeks of dog-whistle politics," when someone uses coded language to send a message to the general population that has an additional or separate meaning for a targeted group. The dog-whistle phrase is a reference to the devices, which emit a tone that can be heard by dogs but is inaudible to humans.
Clayton said this coded language allows those who send the message to "feign a degree of ignorance" if confronted on the matter.
Bevin's comments raised concerns outside Kentucky as well. Jamelle Bouie, a columnist for The New York Times, said in a tweet on Wednesday morning: "Bevin is simply saying the quiet part loud, that the votes of urban dwellers — and blacks in particular — are less legitimate than the votes of white rural and exurban voters."
For Stephen Voss, an associate professor of politics at the University of Kentucky, Bevin's remarks hinted at another baseless claim of voter fraud. When requesting a recanvass of the votes after narrowly losing to Beshear, Bevin suggested there were "significant" voting irregularities.
No evidence was produced, and Bevin conceded following the recanvass. He will leave office Tuesday.
Though Voss said that it is natural for candidates to wonder why they lose and that both parties criticize aspects of the electoral system when they fall short, he believes Bevin's comments were "inappropriate" and "dangerous."
"Voter turnout in urban areas was very high and hostile to Bevin," Voss said. "Clearly, the Democratic Party succeeded in mobilizing their ground game and getting a high turnout in those places."
Accusations of dog-whistle politics are not new for Kentucky. In 2010, when weighing in on false accusations of then-President Barack Obama being a Muslim, then-Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said: "The president says he's a Christian. I take him at his word."
Several commentators said McConnell was using a dog whistle in this situation, potentially leaving room for people to think that the Republican senator from Kentucky believed Obama to be a Muslim.
More recently, people accused Democratic Attorney General candidate Greg Stumbo of using coded language this past summer at Fancy Farm when referring to his African American opponent, now Attorney General-elect Daniel Cameron.
"The attorney general's office is always open to children, so they can see how we run the office," Stumbo said at the time. "But Daniel, we don't let children run the thing."
There is a long history, especially in the South, of African American adults being referred to as "boy" or "gal" by white people. For some, Stumbo approached that line.
"Daniel is 33 years old, he's an attorney and he understands policy," Republican OJ Oleka, one of Cameron's supporters, previously told The Courier Journal. "He is not a child. He's not 15 ... at worst it is a dog whistle to say we can't let this black man be in charge of the state and we can't have him running things."

Texto completo: While President Donald Trump continues to battle accusations of corruption relating to his dealings with Ukraine, Vice President Mike Pence toured parts of West Michigan on Wednesday to connect with one of the campaigns most reliable voter blocs — evangelicals.
Pence arrived in Kalamazoo shortly before noon. He was greeted by Michigan Republican Party Chairwoman Laura Cox before meeting supporters at a local church. Pence arrived in West Michigan as part of a day of scheduled bus tour stops, culminating with a rally in Holland later Wednesday.
Pence met with faith and community leaders before attending a "Keep America Great" event with former White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders.
Pence's tour through parts of West Michigan coincides with the ongoing impeachment inquiry in Washington.
While Pence had mostly stayed away from the topic, he addressed impeachment in front of evangelical supporters during his first stop in Kalamazoo, maligning it as "three years of endless investigation."
"As partisan impeachment continues today, I've come here to Michigan to talk about all that we've accomplished here, because it really is a lot," Pence said. The Trump campaign secured a substantial majority of white, evangelical voters in 2016, and Pence's visit aimed at rallying that base.
He told the audience of about 50 people at Valley Church of Kalamazoo that Democrats were straying too far to the left.
"We've seen the Democratic Party nationally take a leftward turn like I'd never thought I'd see in my lifetime," Pence said. "It's amazing to think at a time when life and liberty are winning in America, the Democratic Party today is embracing far left, radical policies on economic issues and on social issues and the values we most cherish.
"Socialism is a scourge, yet now we have leading voices in the Democratic Party (embracing it)."
Democratic presidential nominees like Sen. Bernie Sanders, D-Vermont, and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Massachusetts, have called for higher tax rates on the ultra-rich.
According to a recent New York Times and Siena College poll in November, Trump trailed Sanders by two points but led Warren by six points among a survey of registered voters in Michigan.
In Holland, Pencewass expected to speak about President Trump's time in office and the importance of Michigan in the 2020 election.
The Holland stop is Pence's first return to the state since attending the Republican Leadership Conference on Sept. 21 on Mackinac Island, and his first trip back to Holland since Nov. 5, 2016.

Texto completo: A roundup of events in every borough, from the Radio City Christmas Spectacular in Manhattan to the annual Holiday Train Show in the Bronx.
A chronological sampling of seasonal celebrations throughout New York City, including concerts, plays and events.
Dickens onstage
Turn on a TV during December, and you're bound to find countless adaptations of Charles Dickens's "A Christmas Carol." It's beginning to feel the same way in New York's theaters. On Broadway, a version by Jack Thorne ("Harry Potter and the Cursed Child") is now open -- and is a New York Times Critic's Pick (achristmascarolbroadway.com). Downtown, in the intimate parlor of the Merchant's House Museum through Jan. 5, John Kevin Jones portrays Dickens recounting his holiday classic on a trip to New York in 1867 (merchantshouse.org). "A Christmas Carol in Harlem," at Aaron Davis Hall through Dec. 21, transports the story to present-day Manhattan (cthnyc.org). And the Staten Island Shakespeare Company tells it from the perspective of Ebenezer Scrooge's damned and departed business partner in "Jacob Marley's Christmas Carol," Dec. 12-22 (sishakespeare.org).
Spectaculars
As synonymous with New York Christmas as "George Balanchine's The Nutcracker," the Radio City Rockettes' "Christmas Spectacular" is now running -- sometimes five times per day -- through Jan. 5 (rockettes.com). At the more humble Kaye Playhouse, the Harlem School of the Arts will present "A Harlemettes Holiday," a celebration of the neighborhood's rich cultural and political history, on Dec. 19 (hsanyc.org). If you're seeking to be dazzled beyond the confines of a theater, though, simply visit the Dyker Heights neighborhood of Brooklyn, whose houses are famous for their blindingly elaborate Christmas decorations. (Guided tours are available through A Slice of Brooklyn Bus Tours.)
Holiday Train Show
It gets bigger every year: Now on view through Jan. 26, the New York Botanical Garden's annual spectacle in miniature features replicas of nearly 200 local landmarks -- all created from natural materials like lotus pods and cinnamon sticks. The latest highlight is a re-creation of Central Park assembled with mosses and holly, and featuring treasures like Belvedere Castle. Select evenings, called Bar Car Nights, cater to the 21-and-older crowd with spiked warm drinks, musical performances and diverse cuisine from the Bronx Night Market Holiday Pop-up (nybg.org).
Carnegie Hall
This storied space is practically booked through the month for holiday concerts. Many of them are annual engagements, such as one by the Vienna Boys Choir on Dec. 8. That same day, in Carnegie's Zankel Hall, Cristina Fontanelli presents the 16th edition of her "Christmas in Italy." The National Children's Chorus arrives on Dec. 15 for a solstice-themed program. (The actual solstice isn't until later, but that's not stopping even Paul Winter from hosting his beloved Winter Solstice celebration Dec. 19-21 at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine.) Also at Carnegie are the duo Keith and Kristyn Getty, who are offering an Irish singalong on Dec. 18, and the New York Pops, reveling in Frank Sinatra and Ella Fitzgerald classics on Dec. 20 and 21 (carnegiehall.org).
Cabaret
The final installment of the Brooklyn Academy of Music's Next Wave Festival will be brief, running Dec. 12-14, with the big-voiced and bawdy chanteuse Meow Meow (bam.org). She has previously performed at Joe's Pub, which has its own slate of seasonal cabaret: Mr. Showbiz himself, Murray Hill, presents "A Murray Little Christmas" Dec. 18-21, with guests including the fearless downtown fixture Bridget Everett; Carolyn Bergier, the host of the podcast "Dyking Out," adds some queer to Christmas cheer in "Dyke the Halls: A Holigay Spectacular" on Dec. 16; and the great Sandra Bernhard closes out the year with "Sandy's Holiday Extravaganza -- A Decade of Madness and Mayhem," Dec. 26-31 (publictheater.org). At Feinstein's/54 Below, Joe Iconis ("Be More Chill") hosts his annual Christmas show that bills itself as "putting the 'extra' in 'extravaganza,"' Dec. 13-15. And Michael Feinstein's "Home for the Holidays," Dec. 23-30, offers a comparatively warmhearted evening by way of the Great American Songbook (54below.com).
Music at the Met
The Metropolitan Museum of Art's rich and varied December programming includes the musician Moya Brennan's concert "An Irish Holiday" (Dec. 13); the cabaret star Ute Lemper's grittier "Weimar Holiday" (Dec. 14); the Handel+Haydn Society's concert featuring one of the museum's Stradivarius violins, played by Aisslinn Nosky (Dec. 20); and the Crossing, an indispensable choral ensemble, performing David Lang's Pulitzer Prize-winning oratorio, "The Little Match Girl Passion," and a new work by Edie Hill (Dec. 21). Mr. Lang's piece, inspired by a Hans Christian Andersen tale, has become a holiday tradition at the Met; its quietly haunting message about homelessness and compassion is always worth hearing again (metmuseum.org).
Bach and Britten
Handel's "Messiah" is never more than an arm's length away during the holidays, but there are plenty of other seasonal choral works worth catching. At Carnegie Hall on Dec. 14, the Cecilia Chorus of New York will sing Bach's sweeping "Christmas Oratorio," led by Mark Shapiro (carnegiehall.org). And, at Saint Thomas Church on Dec. 19, the Boys of the Saint Thomas Choir, joined by the harpist Sara Cutler, will perform Benjamin Britten's smaller -- but no less sublime -- "A Ceremony of Carols" (saintthomaschurch.org).
Audience participation
In Queens, the Langston Hughes Community Library and Cultural Center's Kwanzaa Celebration on Dec. 14 is geared toward families, with a variety of offerings for those who want to be at the center of the programming -- such as workshops -- or just want to remain in the audience at dance and musical performances (queenslibrary.org). Participation is all but required on Dec. 15 in Phil Kline's "Unsilent Night," his annual boombox procession from Washington Square Park to Tompkins Square Park. He always has personal vintage boomboxes to loan (and cassettes for those with their own); but you can also get by with a track available to download, play through a smartphone app or stream on SoundCloud (unsilentnight.com). Another December stalwart, Make Music Winter, returns on the 21st with programming all over the city; among the highlights are a sound walk on the High Line, a fiddle-and-dance parade down Flatbush Avenue and an unseasonal but remarkable marathon performance of Satie's "Vexations" at the World Trade Center (makemusicny.org). One event is a ukulele caroling party at Washington Square Park's arch; if that instrument doesn't suit you, on Dec. 22, the West Village Chorale will host a caroling walk that begins and ends on the park's south side, at Judson Memorial Church (westvillagechorale.org).
Hanukkah
This holiday begins Dec. 22, but the Jewish Museum will celebrate early, on Dec. 15, with family-focused events including a performance by Joanie Leeds & the Nightlights and a workshop to build your own Hanukkah lamp with found objects. Visitors will also be able to take a guided tour of the museum's virtually permanent exhibition "Accumulations," which features more than 80 Hanukkah lamps from around the world (thejewishmuseum.org).
Photograph Clockwise from top, the musical "A Christmas Carol" is being performed at the Lyceum Theater; David Lang's oratorio, "The Little Match Girl Passion," is at the Met Museum; tours of "Accumulations" at the Jewish Museum are part of its Hanukkah programming; the Dyker Heights neighborhood will have another impressive Christmas display; Joe Iconis's Christmas Extravaganza will return to Feinstein's/54 Below; the Boys of the Saint Thomas Choir will perform Benjamin Britten's "A Ceremony of Carols" on Dec. 19.

Thomas L. Friedman: The Middle East is becoming us as we are becoming them

Texto completo: Having covered the Middle East my entire adult life, I’m seeing some trends emerging there that I’ve never seen before.
One is from the streets of Beirut to the streets of Baghdad to streets all across Iran, Middle Easterners are demanding to be treated as citizens with rights, and not just members of a sect or tribe with passions to be manipulated. And they’re clamoring for noncorrupt institutions — a deep state — and the rule of law, not just the arbitrary rule of militias, thugs or autocrats.
And right when Middle Easterners are demanding to be treated as citizens — not Sunnis or Shiites — Americans are devolving into Sunnis and Shiites or, as we call them, Democrats and Republicans, with the same tribal mentality: rule or die.
And worse, the GOP has elevated the exact same kind of autocrat that Middle Easterners are trying to get rid of. Our sultan is just like one of theirs: He shirks the rule of law, nurtures a cult of personality through his own state-directed media, surrounds himself with sycophants, con men and conspiracy buffs, and denounces our professional deep state — its bureaucrats, diplomats and military officers — for trying to shackle him with our 230-year-old constitutional checks and balances.
Go figure. We’re becoming them right when they want to become us — or what used to be us.
The other trend I’m seeing is the striking contrast between what Middle East politics has long been about in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Libya and Yemen and what average people in these countries are now seeking.
For years, Sunni and Shiite party bosses and militia leaders at the top have manipulated sectarian and tribal identities below to cement themselves in power and make themselves the brokers for who get jobs and contracts. But there’s been a stunning shift in the whole flow of politics in some of these countries. It’s gone from Sunnis versus Shiites across the board to Sunnis and Shiites at the bottom locking arms together against all their leaders at the top.
You read some amazing stuff coming up from the bottom these days. Here’s Christine McCaffray van den Toorn, writing on Al-Monitor.com on Nov. 22, describing the scene in Baghdad’s Tahrir Square, the epicenter of the demonstrations there for a nonsectarian, civil state in Iraq:
“Protesters are seizing their country, which was wrenched from them by a corrupt government. In doing so they reaffirm their Iraqiness in the most positive ways. They have even set up reverse checkpoints that welcome citizens but exclude the armed forces. Communities intermingle; different sectors of society stand side by side. Patriotism is on full display. Iraqi flags are everywhere. Women are highly visible. There is a clear rejection of sectarianism, as ‘Iraqi’ identity is emphasized. Everyone helps each other by whatever means — money, chaperones, medical care, internet. There is even a laundry service.”
Elsewhere, she adds, Iraqi resourcefulness is emerging from the bottom: “Startups, including Iraq’s version of Amazon, a grocery-delivery service, coworking spaces and culture cafes, have grown by being outside the purview of the government. There is no shortage of talent or determination to create opportunities in areas where the government has failed. Independent civil society groups, youth and women’s organizations have made major headway.”
And here’s a young Lebanese lawyer friend describing to me what’s been happening in Beirut:
“This is Lebanon’s ‘We the People’ moment. The demonstrations are massive, across all regions, across all sects, and against all political parties (no exceptions). They are also overwhelmingly spontaneous, and the protesters are opposed to the entirety of Lebanon’s sectarian political establishment, which gives the protests credibility in the eyes of the population. Only Lebanese flags are raised at the demonstrations — no partisan flags or sectarian symbols. The slogan ‘The people want a civil state’ is one of the top slogans of the protests.”
These movements are authentic and inspiring, but their chances of taking power remain remote, largely because their biggest opponent — the Islamic Republic of Iran — is ready to arrest and kill as many democracy demonstrators as needed to retain its grip on Iraq, Syria and Lebanon, not to mention at home. Iran’s clerical regime has emerged as arguably the biggest enemy of pluralistic democracy in the region today. There are plenty of Arab dictators keeping their own people down, but Iran is doing it at home and in three other countries at once.
Iran has used its Shiite Hezbollah militia in Lebanon and Syria and its Popular Mobilization Forces militia in Iraq to try to snuff out all their bottom-up secular democratic movements — while also crushing the biggest secular-democracy uprising in Iran itself in 40 years.
The Iranian ayatollahs even had to largely shut down their own internet to prevent the domestic rebellion from spreading. Ever since the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2002, Iran has never wanted to see a stable, multisectarian, secular democracy emerge in Baghdad, because then Iranian Shiites would be asking why Iraqi Shiites get to live freely and they don’t.
If President Donald Trump really wanted to use Twitter for impact, he’d be tweeting every morning at the supreme leader of Iran: “Hey, Supreme Leader of Iran, which nonsectarian Arab-Muslim democracy movement did you crush today? It’s Monday, so it must be Lebanon. It’s Tuesday, so Syria. It’s Wednesday, Iraq. Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday, it must be your own people.”
There is no good time for a country like Iran to be suppressing popular movements for pluralistic democracy, but this is a uniquely bad time. We are in an age of acceleration. Technology, globalization and climate change are all accelerating at the same time. The Middle East has got to get its act together if it has any hope of thriving in the 21st century.
For example, Lebanon’s protests were sparked when the government proposed taxing WhatsApp and other internet calling services to pay down huge government debts incurred by corrupt politicians. But they were also fueled by the government’s inability to deal with massive forest fires spread by high temperatures and prolonged drought. Meanwhile, in places like Libya, Yemen and Syria, kids have missed years of basic schooling. All of this is happening while populations have exploded.
The Arab world and Iran cannot afford to waste another drop of their water, when every climate study shows temperatures rapidly rising in the region; they cannot afford to misspend another dollar of their diminishing oil revenues on guns, civil wars, yachts or corruption, when they need to rebuild so much of their self-destroyed infrastructure that no superpower is going to rebuild for them; they cannot afford to miss another day of school, when lifelong learning is more important than ever to secure and hold a decent job.
If these countries are not able to find a way to break the hold of sectarian misgovernance and find their way to political pluralism, religious pluralism, gender pluralism and education pluralism, their people stand no chance in the 21st century, especially once Mother Nature starts to really hammer them. The entire region could become one giant human development disaster area, with everyone trying to get to Europe.
America, for its part, has to keep looking for ways to collaborate with them on that pluralism project, to the extent that they want our help, with creative diplomacy, and not just wash our hands of the region.
But the bad guys at the top won’t go easily, quietly or bloodlessly. And since no outside power will be riding to the rescue, it will take sustained, organized, bottom-up mass movements — in Lebanon, Iraq and Iran in particular — to enable the future to bury the past and topple all those at the top who want to use the past to bury the future.
I am so rooting for their success.

Texto completo: WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. – With campus groups and faculty pressuring Purdue President Mitch Daniels to atone for his choice of words when he called an African American scholar “one of the rarest creatures in America” and the “rarest phenomenon,” the former governor of Indiana apologized in a letter sent to members of five organizations on campus.
“I retract and apologize for a figure of speech I used in a recent impromptu dialogue with students,” Daniels wrote in a letter sent Wednesday to members of the Purdue chapter of the NAACP, Purdue’s Black Caucus of Faculty and Staff, Purdue’s Latino Faculty/Staff Association, the Black Student Union and the Latino Student Union.
“My reference was in praise of a specific individual and the unique and exciting possibility of bringing that particular individual to Purdue,” Daniels wrote. “The word in question was ill chosen and imprecise and, in retrospect, too capable of being misunderstood. I accept accountability for the poor judgment involved. ”
After racist, anti-Semitic incidents: Syracuse adds security patrols and cameras on campus
Daniels’ comment was made Nov. 20 after a meeting with Purdue Student Government leaders. Student greeted Daniels and asked him to follow up on his thoughts about what Purdue was doing to promote diversity on campus and to make underrepresented minority students feel welcome.
That night, Daniels had been pressed by students about his administration’s response after a Purdue student had been denied the sale of cold medicine because a clerk and a manager at an off-campus CVS Pharmacy had rejected his Puerto Rican driver’s license as sufficient ID. The incident led to student rallies calling on a response from Daniels, which he’d been reluctant to offer.
During the conversation, Daniels talked about recruiting minority faculty.
“At the end of this week, I’ll be recruiting one of the rarest creatures in America – a leading, I mean a really leading, African American scholar,” Daniels said that night, according to a recording made by reporters at the Purdue Exponent newspaper.
Purdue NAACP: We want an apology from President Mitch Daniels
'I’ve never felt so misunderstood before'
When students challenged him on the use of the term “rarest creatures” – “Creatures? Come on,” said D’yan Berry, president of the Black Student Union – Daniels followed up: “It’s a figure of speech. You must have taken some, you know, literature. Let me say, rarest birds. Rarest phenomenon. ”
The backlash was swift on social media and among faculty on the University Senate’s Equity and Diversity Committee, which issued a statement calling Daniels’ phrasing “problematic. ” The Purdue student chapter of the NAACP on Monday called for an apology in a letter to the Lafayette Journal & Courier, a part of the USA TODAY Network.
And on Wednesday, two weeks later, Daniels’ statements were dissected in a New York Times op-ed by G. Gabrielle Starr, president of Pomona College, a private liberal arts college in Claremont, California. In it, Starr wrote that she was breaking from the “standard etiquette for college presidents,” which “is to let the remarks of another leader pass on by. ”
“In just a few sentences, Mr. Daniels seemed to question the possibility of sustained black excellence,” Starr wrote in the New York Times op-ed. “It’s true that the number of black scholars is smaller than one would like. But they’re also suppressed by the fiction that black leadership is an impossible dream – a rare bird. ”
Daniels told the Lafayette Journal & Courier two days after his comments: “I’ve never felt so misunderstood before. ”
Two weeks later, he issued this apology.
“To be clear, I sincerely believe that individuals of every race and ethnicity are capable of and demonstrate academic excellence and achieve top recognition in all of the academic disciplines,” Daniels said. “I also recognize that more needs to be done to recruit, support and encourage individuals from groups that have been historically underrepresented in higher education. My word choice, as clumsy as it was, was an expression of my excitement with the progress of one such effort. ”
African American scholar: We're not as rare as you may think, President Daniels
Purdue professor: 'Misunderstood' Mitch Daniels' track record should buy him grace
Berry said she received the apology via email Wednesday afternoon. Berry said the excitement she felt faded when she saw it had gone to a small collection of people, rather than a public statement sent to the entire campus. Berry called it a half-step for something she said she believed Daniels should have done when she pointed out his language to him that night.
“At this point, it is a public matter,” Berry, a senior, said. “There are other African American scholars all over the world, and people who are not African American scholars, who have taken offense to the statement. At this point, it’s not just a list of 10 people you can apologize to just to put a Band-Aid on the situation. ”
Berry said the murmurs haven’t gone away on campus.
“The campus is very upset, especially in the black community, I can say for sure,” Berry said. “It’s a big issue for people right now, because when you’re paying a lot of money to a university that looks at you like a creature, it kind of rubs you the wrong way. ”
Statement comes in wake of CVS incident
Jorge Perez de Jesus, a Ph. D. student in Latin American literature at Purdue, said he’d been emailing Daniels regularly since Jose Guzman Payano, a Purdue junior from Puerto Rico, had been turned away when he tried to buy cold medicine at the off-campus CVS. CVS apologized and promised to investigate. Perez de Jesus helped organize a protest that urged Daniels stand with students, including on off-campus matters.

In his letter to students, Daniels said that “while I am reviewing past judgment calls,” he regretted not addressing the CVS situation sooner, given that it “precipitated the impromptu dialogue and therefore the misunderstanding. ”
“It would have been possible to express the genuine concern we all felt without condemning prematurely any individual or local business establishment before the facts were known,” Daniels said. “That was a misjudgment on my part and a lesson for the future. ”
“I am glad that he's finally acknowledge that his words, as our university leader, matter,” Perez de Jesus said Wednesday. “The president’s statement lacks specificity. If he were a student in my class I would point this out. However, it is a step forward, and there is a possibility for further dialogue. ”
Carey Walls, a Purdue student and Indiana NAACP Youth and College president, said he wanted to meet with other member of Purdue’s NAACP chapter after receiving Daniels email, two days after the group called for a public apology. He said he would reserve comment until then.
Audrey Ruple, chair of the University Senate’s Equity and Diversity Committee, said she was “grateful to President Daniels for his statement. ”
“I am sure this will have a positive impact on our efforts to address the issues surrounding diversity and inclusion at Purdue University and in our greater community,” Ruple said.
The full text of Purdue President Mitch Daniels' letter
“To my fellow Boilermakers,
“I retract and apologize for a figure of speech I used in a recent impromptu dialogue with students. My reference was in praise of a specific individual and the unique and exciting possibility of bringing that particular individual to Purdue. I wasn’t talking about any group or making generalizations. The word in question was ill chosen and imprecise and, in retrospect, too capable of being misunderstood. I accept accountability for the poor judgment involved.
“To be clear, I sincerely believe that individuals of every race and ethnicity are capable of and demonstrate academic excellence and achieve top recognition in all of the academic disciplines. I also recognize that more needs to be done to recruit, support and encourage individuals from groups that have been historically underrepresented in higher education. My word choice, as clumsy as it was, was an expression of my excitement with the progress of one such effort.
“While I am reviewing past judgment calls, I regret not making some kind of statement at the time of the CVS incident that precipitated the impromptu dialogue and therefore the misunderstanding. It would have been possible to express the genuine concern we all felt without condemning prematurely any individual or local business establishment before the facts were known. That was a misjudgment on my part and a lesson for the future. Sincerely, Mitch. ”

Texto completo: We were all starving students — from baby boomers to Generation X to millennials. We all smuggled apples, cookies and cereal boxes back to our dorm rooms from the dining hall, or lived on ramen as we plowed through unpaid summer internships that would supposedly pay off in the future.
Before I succumb to the holiday spirit, I'm having an Ebenezer Scrooge moment.
Americans gripe about how immigrants want handouts, but the folks that I most often see panhandling appear to be native-born. They stand at intersections and hold up signs that read: "Will work for food."
I think to myself: "That's a coincidence. I do work for food."
In fact, I work 60 hours and seven days a week for food — to feed myself, my wife and our three kids.
Lately, I've been reading a lot about how America's colleges and universities are full of starving students.
Typical is an article that ran in The New York Times in May that featured college seniors who dream about being able to start their day with breakfast, or wind up so delirious from hunger that they wander aimlessly, or take "poverty naps" rather than think about how hungry they are. It's called "food insecurity."
The story cited a Temple University survey that found that 45% of students from more than 100 institutions said they had been food insecure in the past 30 days.
About this, we should be immensely concerned. And, if you are, that makes you a good person. On the other hand, if you are not, you're a heartless ogre who deserves to be hunted by villagers carrying torches and pitchforks.
Since I have, in my more than three decades in the business, known more columnists who fit into the second category than into the first, I feel confident in proceeding with a dab of skepticism.
For instance, we should note upfront that these citadels of higher learning are, by definition, places of privilege — because, while a high school diploma may not get you far in a global economy, a college degree is not what Thomas Jefferson conceived of as an unalienable right.
It does seem as if every generation feels as if it is going through something truly awful that no other generation has ever had to endure.
Right. You don't suppose the members of the World War II generation who grew up during the Great Depression knew anything about hunger pangs?
We were all starving students — from baby boomers to Generation X to millennials. We all smuggled apples, cookies and cereal boxes back to our dorm rooms from the dining hall, or lived on ramen as we plowed through unpaid summer internships that would supposedly pay off in the future.
I spent a summer in New York before my senior year, where — after paying rent — I lived on $10 a day and walked home from work 60 blocks in awful humidity rather than surrender the lone subway token in my pocket.
OK, Gen X'er. That's different. Those were rites of passage. For members of so-called "Generation Z" or "iGen," empty stomachs are suddenly a matter of life and death.
I'm reminded of a funny line from the 1990s television show "Ally McBeal," where the lead character — a narcissistic young lawyer in Boston — is asked: "What makes your problems so much bigger than everybody else's?" Ally responds matter-of-factly: "They're mine."
Nonetheless, we are told by the media that the latest batch of starving students have it worse than anyone else has ever had it in the history of higher education. Paying exorbitant tuitions, and forced to choose between buying books or food, many students may fail out because they're famished.
Many colleges and universities now have on-campus food pantries where hungry students can drop in for a snack between classes.
That's a great idea, and a much-preferred alternative to proposed federal legislation to pay off student debt or make college free for everyone.
Still, these stories about campus starvation have left me hungry for three things that they lack: context, honesty and common sense.
It seems to me that college students who feel food insecure might think about getting a part-time job like many of us had while we were in school. Maybe they could work in the dining hall or a nearby restaurant and eat for free. Or maybe they could move back home, commute to a nearby college, and let mom and dad feed them. Or maybe they could use some of their textbook money to buy food, and check out the books they need from the library.
I mean, if it's not too much of an inconvenience.
The first thing they need to do is grow up. Life is hard. But it doesn't have to be this complicated.
Bah humbug!

Playoffs?!?! Nagy isn't dangling the carrot

Texto completo: Bears coach Matt Nagy understands his team's four-game losing streak in October and early November quickly and unfortunately turned this season into that oft-used Jim Mora GIF. \ Playoffs?!?! Playoffs?!?!
The Bears' chances of playing into January remain as slim as D.J. Qualls. The New York Times' "NFL Playoff Picture" tracker gives the Bears just a 3% chance of reaching the postseason.
The Seahawks, though, did the Bears a favor Monday night, downing the Vikings 37-30. With four games remaining, that pushed the Bears within two games of the Vikings for the NFC's final wild-card spot. And with a win over the Vikings in Week 4, the Bears' head-to-head tiebreaker chances could possibly, potentially, just maybe, perhaps set up a high-stakes game in Minneapolis in Week 17.
Right?
Wait a second ...
Playoffs?!?! Playoffs?!?!
In essence, the Bears' postseason dreams almost certainly will require a six-game winning streak to end the season. And then they'd still need help -- and a lot of it -- to vault past both the Vikings and Rams.
So ...
"We're not focused on trying to make the playoffs right now," Nagy said. "That's not where we're at. We're focused on Dallas. Because if nothing happens with Dallas, then we have to reset again for the following week and see what the deal is."
Cowboys coach Jason Garrett understands his team must seize its own playoff opportunity. Like the Bears, the Cowboys head into Soldier Field at 6-6. But unlike the Bears, the Cowboys play in a shaky division. And thanks in part to the Eagles' demoralizing 37-31 road loss to the Dolphins, the Cowboys hold the NFC East lead, in full control of their playoff drive.
"It's important for everyone to understand where we are and that we control our own destiny," Garrett said. "Then you dig in to preparing one day at a time and one game at a time."
OK. So it's confirmed. The Bears and Cowboys are adopting a very narrow focus on Thursday night with little reason to look beyond it.
But for those wondering just how common it is for a 6-6 team to sneak into the playoffs, recent history shows the door remains open a crack. Since the Texans entered the league in 2002, 22 teams have started the final quarter of the season 6-6 and finished strong enough to make the postseason. (In addition, two 5-7 teams rallied to reach the playoffs. And the 2014 Panthers overcame a 3-8-1 start to win out and win the NFC South.)
Just last year, the team that knocked the Bears out of the postseason caught a wave late in the season and went from 4-6 to 9-7 and then on to the divisional round of the NFC playoffs. With six losses before Thanksgiving, including a 48-7 beatdown by the Saints in Week 11, the 2018 Eagles were left for dead. Until they rose up, snuck into the playoffs and stole a playoff win at Soldier Field.
In 2012, the Vikings left Lambeau Field at 6-6 after a demoralizing 23-14 loss that exposed their young quarterback, Christian Ponder, as erratic and turnover-prone. But the Vikings -- with Ponder limiting his mistakes and MVP Adrian Peterson running wild -- picked off one win at a time for the final four weeks of December and closed the season with a dramatic 37-34 payback win over the Packers. That victory, you might recall, also was the pin that burst the bubble of Lovie Smith's 10-6 Bears, who missed the playoffs and quickly ushered in a coaching search.
Perhaps most significant, the 2011 Giants were a mess at the start of December with a four-game losing streak dropping them to 6-6. Media critics in New York called the Giants "heartless" and "uninspired," skewered Eli Manning's inconsistency and angled for coach Tom Coughlin to be fired.
Nine weeks later, the Giants were showering in confetti at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis while winning the Lombardi Trophy.
These, of course, are a few of the long-shot poster children, the outliers, really.
But in the 6-6 Bowl between the Bears and Cowboys on Thursday night at Soldier Field, the winner will be afforded the luxury of believing in redemption possibilities for at least another week.

Texto completo: Former Vice President Joe Biden announced 15 new endorsements from Puerto Rico on Thursday, including former Gov. Alejandro García Padilla.
Biden's 2020 presidential campaign calls the endorsements "the largest bipartisan slate of Puerto Rican endorsements in a primary election" and said they build on the support Biden has already received from Puerto Rican elected officials in Florida including state Rep. Amy Mercado, D-Orlando, and state Sen. Vic Torres, D-Kissimmee.
The officials include members of the island's Popular Democratic Party and New Progressive Party who affiliate with Democrats nationally.
The Puerto Rican population in Orange, Osceola and Seminole counties is considered key to winning the important I-4 corridor. And in 2018, the number of Puerto Ricans eligible to vote in Florida began to equal that of the politically powerful Cuban-American population, according to a Pew Research Center report.
"Puerto Rico will play a defining role in the 2020 nominating contest," the campaign said in a statement. "With 59 delegates in play, the Vice President's strong show of support in Puerto Rico highlights not only the growing enthusiasm and excitement behind his policy, but the extreme threat that Donald Trump poses to the future of the island."
Besides Padilla, other endorsements include former Sen. Zoé Laboy Alvarado, currently the chief of staff to Gov. Wanda Vázquez Garced; Puerto Rican Sens. Carmelo Ríos Santiago and José Nadal Power; Ponce Mayor María "Mayita" Meléndez Altieri; San Lorenzo Mayor José Román Abreu; Guayanilla Mayor Nelson Torres Yordán; Federation of Puerto Rico College Democrats of America President José Roldán Villanueva; and Puerto Rico Reps. Rafael "Tatito" Hernández Montañez; Carlos A. Bianchi Angleró, José Aníbal Díaz Collazo, José "Conny" Varela Fernández, Javier Aponte Dalmau, José "Che" Pérez Cordero, and Angel Matos García.
Biden has held a steady lead over his Democratic rivals in most Florida polls, including the most recent major poll from New York Times/Siena in October that gave Biden 27% for an eight-point advantage over U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and a 14-point lead over U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vermont.
Biden has made two appearances in Central Florida for fundraisers, in Heathrow in May and in Windermere in October.

Texto completo: The 39th president was treated for a urinary tract infection, the latest of a series of health issues that he has endured in recent months.
WASHINGTON -- Former President Jimmy Carter was released from a Georgia hospital on Wednesday after being treated for a urinary tract infection, the latest of a string of health issues that he has endured in recent months.
Mr. Carter, 95, who became the longest-living president in American history in March, was discharged from Phoebe Sumter Medical Center in Americus, Ga., his office said in a statement.
"He said he looks forward to further rest and recovery at home in Plains, Georgia," Deanna Congileo, his spokeswoman, said in the statement. "He and Mrs. Carter wish everyone peace and joy this holiday season."
Mr. Carter was hospitalized over the weekend for the infection but his office gave few details. He has fallen and sustained serious injuries three times in the past seven months, at one point breaking a hip, at another point breaking his pelvis. He was hospitalized for more than two weeks last month after undergoing surgery to relieve pressure on his brain caused by the falls.
Mr. Carter served as the 39th president from 1977 to 1981 and left office after losing re-election to Ronald Reagan amid economic and foreign policy troubles. He has used his time since the White House to promote a variety of causes, including conflict resolution, eradication of certain diseases and other humanitarian goals. He won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002.

Texto completo: Live up to our values In a whirlwind news week involving blockbuster impeachment hearings and a Democratic debate, The New York Times’ publication of the Community Party of China’s (CPC) internal documents was left by the wayside. Party documents regarding China’s brutal government-sponsored crackdown of ethnic minorities in China’s interior Xinjian region are shocking. Austin Ramzy and Chris Buckley detail the plight of college students returning home to find their families have vanished and veiled threats from party officials to keep their mouths shut. Other reports out of Xinjiang have highlighted worrisome facts, including over a million Uighurs in concentration camps, organ harvesting, forced quartering of communists in Uighur homes and massive surveillance.
As Americans, we understand that the role of the United States as a global leader requires us to lead by example on all issues, especially those of human rights, diplomacy and international engagement. As history has shown, when the United States leads, the world follows. As history has also unfortunately shown, when we step back, when America stands silent as atrocities are committed, the world also remains silent. We saw this in Rwanda, we saw this in Darfur and unfortunately, we are seeing this again in China and Burma. As people of conscience, we cannot allow this to happen.
Recently, the Senate passed the Uighur Human Rights Policy Act of 2019 in a bipartisan manner, and both Senators Durbin and Duckworth voted for the bill. I thank the senators for their votes, and I ask members of Illinois’ congressional delegation to encourage Speaker Pelosi to bring the bill to the House floor.
Standing up for what’s right is our responsibility as a people of conscience. Let’s live up to our values.
Omer A. Rehman Aurora Will senators see reason?
The Washington Post reports that to date, Trump has lied or misled us over 13,435 times since he took office roughly 1,000 days ago. Trump surrounded himself with the likes of Roger Stone, Michael Cohen, Michael Flynn, Paul Manafort, Rick Gates and George Papadopoulos. They have all been convicted in a court of law, with more likely to follow. It seems they like to lie.
So, when credible (might I say impressive?) patriotic members of our foreign service testify in the impeachment hearings, under oath, to the fact that Trump committed a crime, who do you believe? To anyone past the age of reason, the choice is pretty obvious.
Now, all we have to do is wait to see if the Republican senators have reached the age of reason or not.

Texto completo: Anne Hathaway didn't have to dig deep for her latest role in "Dark Waters. "
In Todd Haynes' whistleblower drama (now playing in select theaters, expanding nationwide Friday), the Oscar winner plays the real-life Sarah Bilott, whose husband, lawyer Rob Bilott (Mark Ruffalo), helped expose decades of environmental contamination by chemical company DuPont.
"It's heartbreaking and infuriating on a human level," Hathaway says. "There wasn't really any acting required, in terms of playing someone who was learning of (corruption) and was equal parts aghast and terrified and angry and emotional. "
More: Anne Hathaway on why she's staying sober: 'My last hangover lasted for five days'
Based on a 2016 New York Times Magazine article by Nathaniel Rich, "Dark Waters" begins with Rob taking on a new client: a West Virginia farmer (Bill Camp) who believes his cows' mysterious deaths are caused by a toxic runoff from a DuPont landfill, which contaminated a creek on his land.
Rob's work eventually leads to a study that finds roughly 70,000 people were drinking tainted water with traces of PFOA, a toxic chemical used in the production of Teflon products such as non-stick pans until 2013. DuPont was allegedly aware for years that PFOA exposure is linked to illnesses such as kidney cancer and thyroid disease, and the company was forced to pay out $671 million in personal injury lawsuits in 2017.
The story hit close to home for Hathaway, 37, already a mom to son Jonathan, 3, with husband Adam Shulman, and now "a thousand months pregnant" with a second child, she says good-naturedly by phone.

After reading the script, "I opened the drawer where I keep my pans and pots, and there was a non-stick pan," Hathaway says. "And despite reading an article when I was pregnant with my first child that said 'don't use non-stick,' there was one that had somehow slipped through the cracks and I'd been feeding my family with it for years.
"I try not to blame myself too hard in those circumstances, because I believe that we as human beings and as Americans should never be put in that position where we're just trying to do our best, and we're inadvertently poisoning ourselves and the people we love. "
Hathaway has always had an activist spirit, which is part of the reason why Haynes thought of her to play Sarah.
"Anne has this incredible vitality and intelligence and compassion, and you see that in her work," says the director, best known for the Oscar-nominated "Carol" and "Far from Heaven. " "Sarah is an essential part of the story of Rob and how he was able to do what he did, but also how hard it is on a domestic relationship when somebody takes on the system. "
A vocal member of the Time's Up movement against sexual harassment and workplace discrimination, Hathaway credits her activism to her parents, who instilled the importance of equality and inclusivity from an early age.
More: Review: Mark Ruffalo blows the whistle again in grim but impressive 'Dark Waters'
"I was born in the early '80s, and there were still things I was told I couldn't do because I was a girl," Hathaway says. "I was really lucky I was raised in a household where that sentence was never uttered. It seems strange to me that anybody would try to put me in a box based on the way I was born, when it's so much easier to just accept other people for how they are. So I guess that was my first awareness that the world wasn't a fair place for everyone. "
The actress says she is grateful for her "Dark Waters" co-star Ruffalo, who has long spoken out about climate change and fracking. She also feels encouraged by the work of 16-year-old Greta Thunberg and other young environmental activists.
"I'm so inspired by them – their priorities are exactly right," Hathaway says. "They are focused and doing all the things we tell young people to do. So I don't understand people's negative reaction to this generation, except to say they must be very comfortable with the greed innate in the status quo. "

WE CAN STILL HELP SMALL BUSINESSES KEEP OUR COMMUNITIES STRONG: PLAIN TALK

Texto completo: It's at this time of the year, as Christmas shopping shifts into high gear, that I get nostalgic for those good old days.
We didn't need "Buy Local" campaigns back then, because we were part of an economy where local businesses were the first choice of most American shoppers and, for the most part, were thriving enterprises.
I often hark back to the days when my hometown, little New Glarus barely over 1,200 people plus the surrounding family farm community supported five mom-and-pop grocery stores, four locally-owned auto dealerships, three hardware stores, two drug stores, a well-stocked dime store, a furniture and appliance store and, of course, 12 locally-owned taverns.
Everyone seemed to earn a living, and each contributed to the community in many ways. They sponsored youth sports leagues, bought shirts for bowling teams, helped underwrite the school play and the school's athletic programs and contributed regularly to the church.
After moving to Madison a few years later, we could do all the Christmas shopping on just one trip around the Capitol Square, visiting great local department stores like Harry S. Manchester, the Emporium, Wolff Kubly Hirsig, men's clothiers like the Hub, Karsten's "the dress store of Madison" Spoo and Sons for fancy shoes, Yost's for women's clothing, Wisconsin Felton Sporting Goods, just for starters. The bottom line is that what you spent here, for the most part, stayed here.
Those days are long gone, done in by giant national retailers who opened in big shopping malls far from downtown that were perceived to be more convenient and offered lower prices. Walmart added to the demise of New Glarus-sized local Main Streets, and the big auto companies yanked dealerships from the little guys who'd sell a dozen or so cars a year.
Now there's even more pressure on the local merchants that are left. Tim Wu, a Columbia University law professor and author of "The Curse of Bigness: Antitrust in the New Gilded Age," penned a New York Times column a few days ago lamenting the passing of a neighborhood hardware store in Manhattan. It could no longer weather the double whammy of skyrocketing rents and the penchant of customers to order from Amazon online.
Wu told the story of the Russian immigrant who opened the hardware in the early 1990s and thrived by offering customers not only convenience but service, only to now succumb to the online phenomenon.
"In today's economy, returns on investment have shifted away from the individuals like Mr. Feygin (the store's owner) who take personal risks," he wrote. "Instead, wealth is being routed to large middlemen, national monopolies, property owners and shareholders."
And so today, folks need to be reminded about the importance of preserving and promoting the local businesses that still persevere alongside the giant chains.
"Dane Buy Local" is an organization that's been around for more than 10 years now, and its membership has grown to more than 600 small businesses throughout the county. Its aim is to remind consumers that it's wise to patronize local merchants, if for no other reason than to bolster the local economy.
According to several national economic studies, it's estimated that 48% of each purchase at local independent businesses is circulated locally, compared to 14% of purchases at chain stores. And even better, the stronger the local business community, the stronger its civic involvement and support for good causes.
No, we'll never return to those days where five mom-and-pop stores could survive in the smallest of our communities, but through our support, we can keep those who still represent the fabric of our communities alive and well.

Texto completo: BOYNTON BEACH - The Ring doorbell video is achingly familiar: its wide-angle lens shows someone walking up to the doorstep, picking up a package and then trotting away across a front yard.
What happened after that wasn't so familiar, according to Boynton Beach police.
"Shout-out to the Amazon Prime delivery driver who called 911 after she saw a girl running down the street with a package that had just been delivered," police said in a Facebook posting Monday.
After grabbing the box on Saturday, the person seen on the surveillance camera dropped it in some nearby bushes on Southwest Eighth Avenue.
The unidentified Amazon driver saw all this and brought the package back to where it had been snatched, police said.
The driver told police she had noticed that her truck that day was being followed by at least two people - one male and one female - who were riding bicycles.
The incident was noticed by the ABC program "Good Morning America" which broadcast a segment Tuesday on ways to protect packages from being stolen. It included the surveillance video from Boynton Beach police and a telephone comment from the unidentified Amazon Prime driver.
"As soon as they saw me coming around the corner and I saw them with the box, they flew down the road," the driver said.
More than 1.7 million packages are stolen or go missing around the country every day, according to an analysis done for a New York Times story published this week.
The female who grabbed the package from the porch was, at the time, wearing a light-colored shirt, bluejeans, a red head scarf and headphones.
Investigators ask anyone with information about this incident to contact the Boynton Beach Police Department at 561-732-8116 or Palm Beach County Crime Stoppers, anonymously, at 800-458-8477.
Additionally, police say there are ways to make sure your delivered packages aren't stolen:
*Consider having it delivered to your community's management office or your place of business;
*Require a signature for delivery;
*Schedule delivery (if possible) for when someone's home;
*Invest in doorbell/home video surveillance system.

André Daguin, Who Turned a Lowly Meat Into a Top Dish, Is Dead at 84

Texto completo: His menu, most notably the grilled duck breast, made a region of southwest France a required stop for traveling food lovers.
André Daguin, a chef who helped put Gascony on the culinary map and made grilled duck breast the most popular dish in France, died on Tuesday at his home in the remote town of Auch, where he achieved his renown running the kitchen of his family's hotel. He was 84.
His daughter Ariane Daguin, the founder and owner of the American meat and charcuterie company d'Artagnan, said the cause was pancreatic cancer.
Mr. Daguin, the descendant of generations of chefs, hotelkeepers and charcutiers, took over the kitchen of the Hôtel de France in 1959 and almost immediately made a daring decision. Up to that time, breast of duck was a little-regarded ingredient, used primarily in confits -- meat simmered and preserved in its own fat.
He decided to grill the breast, or magret, like a steak.
"I called it grilled red meat on the menu, and people bought it and thought it was beef," he told Molly O'Neill of The New York Times in 1992.
News of the dish reached the wider world when Robert Daley, then a Times foreign correspondent, described the new mystery meat on the front page of the newspaper's travel section in an article with the headline "A Meaty Whodunit: Grilling of Magret."
Initially, "Lou Magret aux Braises," as it appeared on the menu, was served with a béarnaise sauce made with duck fat. But in 1965, Mr. Daguin, an experimenter enthralled with nouvelle cuisine, created a green peppercorn sauce for his duck. The dish became an instant classic, and duck breast became wildly popular. Today, grilled duck breast appears in the top spot in surveys of France's favorite dishes, just ahead of moules frites and couscous.
Mr. Daguin's innovations did not stop with duck breast. He skewered chunks of foie gras, another of Gascony's main products, with sea scallops. He paired foie gras with langoustine, an unheard-of combination. He used liquid nitrogen to make instant ice creams of prune and Armagnac, the local brandy, and of Tarbais beans, another local product normally encountered in cassoulets. His restaurant earned a Michelin star in 1960 and a second star 10 years later, making Auch, population 25,000, a required stop for traveling food lovers.
André Daguin was born in Auch on Sept. 20, 1935. His father, Albert, who had taken over the Hôtel de France in 1926, was, like his father before him, a renowned chef. His mother, Lucienne (Filippi) Daguin, ran the hotel with her four sisters after Albert's death during World War II.
Although frail at birth, weighing only four pounds, André developed into a star rugby player at the local lycée. Setting his sights on a legal career, he traveled to Scotland for his studies.
After a year, family tradition pulled him back to France, where he enrolled in a two-year course of study at the École Hotelière in Paris, whose lack of regard for his native region, in the southwest, aroused his ire.
"I was taught nothing about foie gras, nothing about confits, nothing about magrets, nothing about carcasses," he told Mr. Daley of The Times. "I was taught that goose fat is good for nothing and must be thrown away, but this is false; it can be used in sauces in place of butter. A good deal of what I was taught I later found to be false."
At hotel school he met Jocelyne Grass, a fellow student. He married her after graduating in 1957, and she later worked at the front of the house at his restaurant. His daughter Ariane said in an email that he had died "peacefully, holding my mother's hand."
In addition to his wife and his daughter Ariane, Mr. Daguin is survived by a son, Arnaud, who operates Hégia, an inn near Biarritz; another daughter, Anne Daguin, who owns the pastry shop Le Petit Duc in St. Rémy, Provence; and four granddaughters.
After cooking in game and fish restaurants in Paris, Mr. Daguin performed his required military service. Late in his term of service, he was pulled from duty on an emergency furlough to cook for President Charles de Gaulle, who had stopped in Auch for lunch while making a political tour of the southwest.
Mr. Daguin made it his mission to popularize traditional Gascon dishes, like the thick soup known as garbure, and to act as an ambassador for the region's culinary heritage.
"Among Gascon chefs, Mr. Daguin has long been the undisputed leader," Patricia Wells wrote in The Times in 1982, "and now he is becoming a sort of idol among southwestern housewives, who are proud to see him popularize the simple dishes they have cooked for generations in farm kitchens all over the sparsely populated southwest."
To promote the region, Mr. Daguin in 1962 created La Ronde de Mousquetaires, a consortium of Gascon restaurants. The association L'Esprit du Sud (Spirit of the South), which he helped found in 2016, agitates on behalf of all things traditionally Gascon, including bullfighting, hunting and the fattening of geese for foie gras.
Mr. Daguin retired as chef in 1997. From 1991 to 2008 he served as president of the Hotel Professionals Union, a trade association representing hotel, restaurant and nightclub owners. Opinionated, blunt and occasionally pugnacious, he appeared regularly on the topical radio program "Les Grandes Gueules" ("The Big Mouths") from its inception in 2004.
He was the author of three cookbooks: "Le Nouveau Cuisinier Gascon" (1981); "Foie Gras, Magret and Other Good Food From Gascony" (1988), written with Anne de Ravel; and "1 Duck, 2 Daguin" (2010), written with his son, Arnaud. His food memoir, "Je Pense, Donc Je Cuis" ("I Think, Therefore I Cook"), was published in 2013.
"Cooking is simple," he told The Times in 1977. "It's to put the maximum of taste into the minimum of volume."

Texto completo: Donald Trump’s Republican congressional allies are throwing up different defenses against impeachment and hoping that something may sell. They say that he didn’t seek a corrupt political bargain with Ukraine, but that if he did, he failed, and the mere attempt is not impeachable. Or that it is not clear that he did it, because the evidence against him is unreliable “hearsay.”
It’s all been very confusing. But the larger story — the crucial constitutional story — is not the incoherence of the president’s defense. It is more that he and his party are exposing limits of impeachment as a response to the presidency of a demagogue.
The founders feared the demagogue, who figures prominently in the Federalist Papers as the politician who, possessing “perverted ambition,” pursues relentless self-aggrandizement “by the confusions of their country.” The last of the papers, Federalist No. 85, linked demagogy to its threat to the constitutional order — to the “despotism” that may be expected from the “victorious demagogue.” This “despotism” is achieved through systematic lying to the public, vilification of the opposition and, as James Fenimore Cooper wrote in an essay on demagogues, a claimed right to disregard “the Constitution and the laws” in pursuing what the demagogue judges to be the “interests of the people.”
Should the demagogue succeed in winning the presidency, impeachment in theory provides the fail-safe protection. And yet the demagogue’s political tool kit, it turns out, may be his most effective defense. It is a constitutional paradox: The very behaviors that necessitate impeachment supply the means for the demagogue to escape it.
As the self-proclaimed embodiment of the American popular will, the demagogue portrays impeachment deliberations as necessarily a threat to democracy, a facade for powerful interests arrayed against the people that only he represents. Critics and congressional opponents are traitors. Norms and standing institutional interests are fraudulent.
President Trump has made full use of the demagogic playbook. He has refused all cooperation with the House. He lies repeatedly about the facts, holds public rallies to spread these falsehoods and attacks the credibility, motives and even patriotism of witnesses. His mode of “argument” is purely assaultive. This is the crux of the Trump defense, and not an argument built on facts in support of a constitutional theory of the case.
Of course, all the presidents who have faced impeachment mounted a political defense, to go with their legal and constitutional case. And it is not unusual that they — and, even more vociferously, their allies — will attack the process as a means of undoing an election.
The difference in Mr. Trump’s case is not merely one of degree. Richard Nixon despised his opposition, convinced of their bad faith and implacable hatred for him. But it is hard to imagine Mr. Trump choosing (and actually meaning) these words to conclude, as Nixon did, a letter to the chair of Judiciary Committee: “[If] the committee desires further information from me … I stand ready to answer, under oath, pertinent written interrogatories, and to be interviewed under oath by you and the ranking minority member at the White House.”
Mr. Trump has instead described Adam Schiff, the chairman of the Intelligence Committee, as a “corrupt” politician who shares with other “human scum” the objective of running the “most unfair hearings in American history.”
These remarks are not merely one more instance of Mr. Trump’s failure to curb his impulses. This is his constitutional defense strategy. Mr. Trump’s White House counsel, informing the House of the president’s refusal to cooperate, declared that the impeachment process is unconstitutional and invalid — a “naked political strategy” — and advised that the president would not participate. It matters that the president’s lawyer, in a formal communication with the House, used rhetoric that might have been expected from the hardest-core political supporters. Once again, contrasts with past impeachments are illuminating. Bill Clinton’s White House counsel Charles Ruff testified before the House Judiciary Committee, pledging to “assist you in performing your constitutional duties.”
The demagogue may be boundlessly confident in his own skills and force of political personality, but he cannot succeed on those alone. He can thrive only in political conditions conducive to the effective practice of these dark arts, such as widespread distrust of institutions, a polarized polity and a fractured media environment in which it is possible to construct alternative pictures of social realities. Weak political parties now fall quickly into line with a demagogue who can bring intense pressure to bear on party officials and officeholders through his hold on “the base.” As we have seen with Mr. Trump, the demagogue can bully his party into being an instrument of his will, silencing or driving out dissenters. Republican officeholders know that Mr. Trump can take to Twitter or to Fox News or to the podium at rallies — or all of the above — to excoriate them for a weak will or disloyalty.
This is how the Republican Party has become Mr. Trump’s party. It is also why that party will not conceive of its role in impeachment as entailing a constitutional responsibility independent of the president’s political and personal interests. It has come to see those interests as indistinguishable from its own. In this way the constitutional defense of the case against Mr. Trump and the defense of his own interests become one and the same. As another fabled demagogue, Huey Long of Louisiana, famously announced: “I’m the Constitution around here now.”
The implications for the constitutional impeachment process are dire. Until Mr. Trump, modern impeachment has ended with some generally positive assessment of its legacy. Nixon’s resignation appeared to indicate that serious charges could bring the parties together in defense of the rule of law. “The system worked” was a popular refrain, even if this was a somewhat idealized and oversimplified version of events. The Clinton impeachment suggested that the standards for an impeachable offense required a distinction between public misconduct and private morality, and Congress reclaimed its responsibility for impeachment from an independent counsel statute that was allowed to lapse.
The Trump impeachment is headed toward a very different summation. A demagogue can claim that Congress has forfeited the right to recognition of its impeachment power, then proceed to unleash a barrage of falsehoods and personal attacks to confuse the public, cow legislators and intimidate witnesses. So long as the demagogue’s party controls one of the two chambers of Congress, this strategy seems a sure bet.
When this is all over, we will not hear warm bipartisan praise for how “the system worked.” The lesson will be that, in the politics of the time, a demagogue who gets into the Oval Office is hard to get out.

Prestigious public high school stages walkout to protest that school is 50% white

Texto completo: Students from one of the most selective New York City public high schools, which is half white, staged a walkout to advocate for more diversity in the city’s schools.
About 300 students at the prestigious Beacon High School walked out of class on Monday to demonstrate against the school’s stringent admissions standards, according to the New York Times. They believe that rigid screening procedures have contributed to segregation in the school system.
“The abundance of privilege in our school is so universal that it usually goes unquestioned and unnoticed,” said Toby Paperno, a white student at the school.
During the protest, students chanted slogans such as “end Jim Crow” and “education is a right, not just for the rich and white.”
Beacon has a very selective admissions process that demands high test scores and requires students to compile a portfolio of their middle school work. Last year, the school saw more than 5,800 applications for just 360 seats.
Students argued that Beacon demonstrates a systemic issue of discrimination in the city’s school system. The largest in the country, the school system is about 70% black and Hispanic.
“Beacon is really important because if students within Beacon are saying that the system is not working, this means that even the ones who are benefiting are not having it, that this is not working for anyone,” said Carmen Lopez Villamil, a Hispanic student at the school.
Mayor Bill de Blasio, whose daughter is a Beacon alumna, has pushed for more diversity in schools but has not been able to implement a concrete plan. A panel commissioned by de Blasio recommended that New York not open any more screened schools and eliminate the majority of screening for middle schools.
“Our schools are stronger when they reflect the diversity of our city, and we’re taking a look at our admissions processes,” said Katie O’Hanlon, a spokeswoman for the city’s Department of Education.
Some parents are against the elimination of screening and have contended that students who work hard in middle school and show that they excel in academics should have the ability to attend the best high schools in the city.
The 30-minute walkout was planned by Teens Take Charge, a student group that advocates for more racial diversity in schools. The group has organized other demonstrations at public schools over the past few weeks.

Kamala Harris is dropping out because she tried to be the consensus candidate

Texto completo: Sen. Kamala Harris's stunning collapse from being a leading Democratic presidential candidate to dropping out before Iowa is a lesson in what happens when a candidate tries to consciously run as a consensus choice rather than on a clear vision.
Going into the Democratic nomination battle, Harris was actually viewed by many insiders as the one most likely to be the nominee. In addition to her intelligence and political talents, on paper, the thinking was that her status as both a female and a person of color could appeal to multiple key demographics. She had a background as a prosecutor and as a traditional pragmatic liberal that would satisfy the establishment, but also had embraced policies (such as socialized health insurance) to make her more acceptable to the Left than Joe Biden. As a bonus, many analysts projected she would benefit from her home state of California — the biggest delegate prize — having moved up its primary. When she mauled Biden in the first debate over school busing and surged in polls in July, it affirmed these predictions. And yet, it's been downhill ever since.
There will be many obituaries written about the Harris campaign — about tactics, staffing, organization, fundraising, and so forth. But ultimately what her candidacy shows is that it's very difficult to win by trying to be the default candidate — the one that everybody is fine with, who checks all of the boxes without really having a clear defining message that can inspire people. We saw a similar pattern with Sen. Marco Rubio in 2016. He was the guy who was going to unify the Tea Party and the Establishment, who could open up opportunities for Republicans to appeal to a younger and more diverse electorate, and so forth. While he got further than Harris, in the end, he was steamrolled by Donald Trump, who connected with primary voters on a much more visceral level.
In Harris's case, she made a major blunder by trying early on to compete with Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren for the support of the far Left, most notably, on healthcare. Her cynical shifts went from endorsing the Sanders plan to eliminate private insurance, to emphasizing mythical "supplemental" policies, and then to releasing a separate plan, managing to alienate everybody. Hardcore single-payer enthusiasts came to see her as unreliable, and yet traditional liberals saw her as too radical. This cynicism was also on full display when she attacked Biden on busing only to back off her attack and eventually acknowledge that she basically had the same position as he did. Harris, the normally sure-footed debater, also struggled to square her record as a law and order prosecutor with her current rhetoric when under attack from Rep. Tulsi Gabbard.
Instead of trying to reverse-engineer the type of candidate she thought would appeal to a plurality of voters, Harris just should have run on who she is, which probably would have put her somewhere in the traditional incrementalist liberal camp, perhaps slightly to the left of Biden. In the end, there was clearly much more room for her to compete in that space, and it would have saved her a lot of the flip flops and pandering that came to undermine her candidacy.

Mariss Jansons, Conductor Who Made Ensembles Shine, Dies at 76

Texto completo: He drew memorable performances from symphonies in Munich, Amsterdam, Oslo, Pittsburgh and elsewhere.
Mariss Jansons, a renowned conductor who brought new distinction to orchestras in Oslo and Pittsburgh before taking the helm of two of Europe's finest ensembles, the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra of Munich and the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra of Amsterdam, died on Sunday in St. Petersburg, Russia. He was 76.
The Amsterdam orchestra was among those announcing his death. He had been in failing health recently, and had long dealt with heart problems. In 1996, he collapsed onstage in Norway while conducting the Oslo Philharmonic after having a severe heart attack.
"Mariss Jansons was an extraordinarily inspiring musician who gave us innumerable wonderful moments," Jan Raes, managing director of the Concertgebouw, which Mr. Jansons led from 2004 to 2015, said in a statement on the group's website.
Before taking the Concertgebouw post, Mr. Jansons was music director of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra from 1997 to 2004, delivering performances that were technically brilliant but notably expressive.
He also spent more than two decades as music director of the Oslo Philharmonic, beginning in 1979. He was widely credited with bringing that orchestra to international prominence. He was also principal guest conductor of the London Philharmonic Orchestra in the 1990s.
In 2008, Gramophone, the classical music magazine, asked a panel of music critics to rank the best orchestras in the world. The Concertgebouw was No. 1 on the list; the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra was No. 6. Mr. Jansons was chief conductor of both at the time.
In 2013 the critic Anne Midgette of The Washington Post called him simply "the greatest living conductor."
Mariss Ivars Georgs Jansons was born on Jan. 14, 1943, in Riga, Latvia, which was under Nazi occupation at the time. His mother, Iraida, was in hiding at the time because she was Jewish.
He certainly had music in his DNA. His mother was an opera singer, and his father, Arvid, was a conductor. Young Mariss was introduced to the Riga Opera House early -- perhaps too early.
"My father once took me to see my mother in 'Carmen,"' he told The New York Times in 2005, "and in the first act, when they grab Carmen and take her to jail, I started shouting, 'Don't touch my mother!"'
He recalled sitting in on his father's rehearsals at 3; sometimes he would wave a stick in imitation.
At the end of World War II Latvia came under the control of the Soviet Union, as it had been briefly before the Nazis arrived. As a teenager Mr. Jansons moved to Leningrad (now St. Petersburg), where his father became assistant conductor of the Leningrad Philharmonic, and began to study conducting himself at the Leningrad Conservatory.
In 1969, having impressed the Austrian conductor Herbert von Karajan during a master class in Leningrad, he won a scholarship to study in Vienna. He became Karajan's assistant at three Salzburg Festivals, and in 1971 he was named associate conductor of the Leningrad Philharmonic.
Some Soviet artists defected during this period, but not Mr. Jansons.
"I had mixed feelings," he told The Times in 1994. "St. Petersburg is a great city, with great culture. It gave me so much: my education. And although I thought, yes, this is a terrible dictatorship, I was never prohibited from working or traveling."
In 1979 he became music director of the Oslo Philharmonic, which at the time was something of an afterthought on the European scene. Recordings of Tchaikovsky works in the 1980s were key to increasing its profile, though Mr. Jansons and the orchestra had to take the initiative to get a contract.
"We made our own tape, at our own expense, of Tchaikovsky's Fifth," he told The Independent of London in 1993. "We brought it to London, showed it around, and Chandos liked it so much that they eventually gave us a contract for the whole cycle of Tchaikovsky symphonies."
When he was hired in Pittsburgh, he succeeded Lorin Maazel. He was again credited with implementing a significant upgrade.
"When he took it over from Lorin Maazel in 1997, this was a respectable, B-list group," Allan Kozinn wrote in a review in The Times in 2004, when Mr. Jansons brought the orchestra to New York. "But the incarnation of the Pittsburgh Symphony that Mr. Jansons conducted on Tuesday and Wednesday evenings at Carnegie Hall was a streamlined, virtuoso ensemble. And the music at hand, though all drawn from the mainstream repertory, had an enlivening vitality that made a listener wish Mr. Jansons and company were staying out the week."
Mr. Jansons's programs often featured the Russians -- Tchaikovsky and Shostakovich were favorites -- but as his career went along he showed more willingness to branch out. "His concerts avoid clichés and aim for surprise," the British cultural commentator Norman Lebrecht wrote in 2000.
The numerous recordings Mr. Jansons made with various orchestras also sometimes showed a taste for underappreciated works. In 1999, for instance, he and the Berlin Philharmonic recorded orchestral works by Kurt Weill, a composer much better known from the theater.
Mr. Jansons often noted that each of the many orchestras he conducted had different strengths and sounds. The Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra, where he had been chief conductor since 2003, particularly impressed him when it was at its quietest.
"We have a very full sound, very emotional, brilliant and dark, the full spectrum," he said in an interview on the orchestra's website. "What pleases me most is our pianissimo: It's easy to play soft, but extremely hard to sound vibrant and expressive at the same time. This orchestra can do it."
The 1996 heart attack that nearly killed him was almost a case of history repeating itself. His father, too, had a heart attack while performing, in 1984; his was fatal. Mr. Jansons said his own near-death experience changed him musically.
"Of course, you start to analyze what is important in life, really, and what is a priority, and how to divide your time and calculate your energy," he told The Times in 1997. "But then something comes unconsciously, and this is what I felt in music. I started to like calmer music, quieter music. I like slower tempos. I enjoy it more, because I enjoy, perhaps, a more philosophical approach."
Mr. Jansons's first marriage ended in divorce. His survivors include his second wife, Irina (Outchitel) Jansons, and a daughter from his first marriage, Ilona. He lived in St. Petersburg.
Mr. Jansons often listened to internal recordings of his performances immediately afterward, scouting for what could have been done better.
"Nothing was ever good enough," Robert Moir, the Pittsburgh symphony's senior vice president of artistic planning, told The Post in 2013, adding, "No matter how blazingly outstanding the performance was -- and they all were; I don't remember a bad concert in the time he was here -- I don't remember him being satisfied."

Texto completo: If the attorney general rebuts the finding that the F.B.I. had sufficient cause to open the investigation, the president's allies could use his skepticism to dismiss the entire report.
WASHINGTON -- Attorney General William P. Barr has told Justice Department officials that he is skeptical of a conclusion by the department's inspector general that the F.B.I. had sufficient information to open the investigation into whether any Trump associates conspired with Russia during the 2016 presidential race, according to two people familiar with the conversations.
Should Mr. Barr rebut the inspector general's assessment, due out next week in a highly anticipated report, Mr. Trump's allies will most likely use that pushback to dismiss the work itself. The review is expected to contradict some of the unfounded theories about the 2016 election that the president and his allies have promoted.
Mr. Barr's doubts are significant because they could be perceived as the nation's top law enforcement officer siding with Mr. Trump, who has long cast doubt on the legitimacy of the Russia investigation, over law enforcement officials.
His views are sure to inflame critics of Mr. Barr, who have accused him of siding with the president over the rule of law in his handling of the special counsel's findings and in a recent speech in which he defended Mr. Trump's use of executive authority. While it is a part of the executive branch, the Justice Department has typically sought to maintain some independence from the White House to guarantee that justice is applied fairly and not wielded as a political cudgel.
Mr. Barr's skepticism could place more pressure on John H. Durham -- the federal prosecutor who is conducting a separate criminal inquiry into the roots of the Russia investigation -- to find evidence backing Mr. Barr's position. Mr. Durham has already unearthed some evidence that supports Mr. Barr's uncertainty of the inspector general's findings, according to a lawyer involved in the Durham inquiry.
The attorney general has also expressed skepticism at the F.B.I.'s decision to investigate Mr. Trump's own ties to Russia and whether he obstructed justice. It is unclear whether the report by the inspector general, Michael E. Horowitz, will address that.
Mr. Barr has privately praised Mr. Horowitz for his work and has not made clear whether he will publicly disagree with the report. It is standard practice for the Justice Department to submit to the inspector general a written response to his findings, which is then included in the final assessment. Mr. Barr could use that opportunity to issue a formal rebuttal, or he could make a public statement of some other kind.
"The inspector general's investigation is a credit to the Department of Justice," the department's spokeswoman, Kerri Kupec, said in a statement on Monday night. "Rather than speculating, people should read the report for themselves next week, watch the inspector general's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, and draw their own conclusions about these important matters."
A spokeswoman for Mr. Horowitz declined to comment. The Washington Post first reported the dispute.
It was not clear what Mr. Barr based his uncertainty on. The threshold to open the Russia investigation was not particularly high. The F.B.I. can open a preliminary inquiry based on "information or an allegation" that a crime or threat to national security may have occurred or will occur, according to bureau policy. Typically, agents open counterintelligence investigations with a small amount of evidence, Lisa Page, a former F.B.I. lawyer who has also been a target of Mr. Trump's ire, testified privately to congressional investigators last year.
The conclusion that the F.B.I. had enough evidence when it opened the Russia investigation will be part of the long-anticipated report that wraps up Mr. Horowitz's nearly two-year inquiry into aspects of the case, including its origins and whether the F.B.I. abused its surveillance powers when it sought a wiretap of a former Trump campaign adviser.
While Mr. Horowitz is expected to sharply criticize the F.B.I.'s top leaders, he is not expected to find that any of the bureau's officials acted out of political bias against Mr. Trump when they decided to investigate links between his associates and Russia. Ultimately, Mr. Horowitz concluded that the F.B.I. violated no rules when it began its delicate inquiry, work that not only thrust the bureau into a politically treacherous position, but has also overshadowed much of Mr. Trump's presidency.
Mr. Horowitz's "excellent work has uncovered significant information that the American people will soon be able to read for themselves," Ms. Kupec said in her statement.
The special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, eventually took over the Russia inquiry and affirmed that Russia had interfered in the 2016 election. But he found insufficient evidence to charge any Trump associates with conspiring with the Russian operation and declined to say whether Mr. Trump obstructed the investigation itself.
Mr. Barr, who has for decades expressed a maximalist view of executive authority, has long questioned whether aspects of the inquiry were legitimate. His skepticism began even before he was attorney general, when he wrote a 19-page memo to Justice Department leaders arguing that Mr. Trump was within his authority to fire James B. Comey as F.B.I. director, which Mr. Mueller was investigating as potential obstruction of justice. During a hearing, Mr. Barr told Congress that he believed that "spying" had occurred on the Trump campaign, and that he wanted to determine whether that surveillance was lawfully predicated.
As Mr. Horowitz worked on his review, senior Justice Department officials have also discussed putting in place procedures and guidelines that would force the bureau to get Justice Department approval before opening an investigation on someone like the president, one person who has been briefed on those conversations said.
Mr. Horowitz also found that a low-level lawyer at the F.B.I., Kevin Clinesmith, altered a document to include false information, and then included it in a packet of information that the F.B.I. used to renew a warrant to secretly wiretap a former Trump campaign adviser.
That information could have been part of the reason Mr. Durham began his work as a departmental review and shifted it in recent months to a full criminal investigation. He is not expected to complete his work anytime soon. His criminal investigation spans not only the F.B.I., the subject of Mr. Horowitz's report, but also the C.I.A.
Mr. Horowitz will release the more than 400-page report next Monday, and he will testify before Congress about his findings on Dec. 11.

Texto completo: Remembering a life cut short.
I remember a morning of unadulterated goodness. I'd come to celebrate graduation at a local men's prison. The inmates had spent the semester studying criminal justice with students from the University of Cambridge as part of a program called Learning Together. The men from the prison dressed up for the occasion, hair slicked back and shirts tucked in.
Jack Merritt, my classmate at Cambridge and a program participant, recited a poem he'd written on forgiveness and rehabilitation. I remember feeling surprised by his words, so unselfconsciously earnest. I'd known him mostly for his dry wit, his boyishly good looks and his reputation as a criminology class clown.
Jack was stabbed to death during a terrorist attack near London Bridge on Friday. The attacker, Usman Khan, had been convicted of terrorism offenses in 2012. He was released from prison last year. Just before the attack, Jack was in Fishmongers' Hall, a building adjacent to the bridge, helping to lead a conference on prisoner rehabilitation, an alumni celebration for Learning Together. Mr. Khan, who was attending the conference, began his rampage as a creative writing workshop was wrapping up inside the hall, around 2 p.m.
The injustice of somebody murdered while organizing for criminal justice feels impossibly sharp. Jack, who was 25 and from Cambridge, was in a room of people, some on day release from prison, discussing possibilities for penal reform.
But the world is full of injustice, and young people denied opportunity. Jack understood that better than most.
When I read the news of the attack, I pictured him back at Grendon prison reading his graduation poem. I remember how the students and inmates waved their diplomas in the air that day, pulling each other in for hugs and inside jokes. I remember how the prison auditorium felt blissfully full. A food truck came to hand out free burritos. An older man from the prison read a slam poem about unlikely friendships. I tried to blot my eyes dry, until I realized the young woman beside me was crying, too.
Cambridge, like much of Britain, was a place of political extremes. We dressed in robes for formal dinners, then gravely debated the gaudy tradition. The winter I was there, a Snapchat video shared with the press showed a student in black tie burning a 20-pound note in front of a homeless person. This was months after the Brexit vote. Everything felt ideologically fraught.
Learning Together was a balm during that time, with its focus on empathy and its commitment to the complexity and necessity of second chances. The goal of the program was to reduce stigma and recidivism by giving university students and inmates a chance to study together. They took classes on political theory, poetry and prison reform. Jack stayed on after we graduated to become the course coordinator.
Learning Together was celebrating its fifth anniversary on Friday, in an event that convened prisoners, probation staff members, students and experts on criminology from across Britain. The attack began when Mr. Khan, who was wearing what turned out to be a fake suicide belt, ascended the grand staircase at Fishmongers' Hall, pulled out two knives and threatened to blow up the building.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson responded to the attack by calling for more punitive measures for prisoners. He demanded changes to the country's policy on automatic release, which allows most prisoners to be released halfway through their sentences if they meet certain conditions. Mr. Khan was part of a gang that plotted in 2010 to plant explosives in the London Stock Exchange. He was freed halfway through his term, last December, without a parole board assessment.
When Mr. Khan began his assault on Friday, bystanders tried to intervene and wrestle him to the ground. They grabbed anything weapon-like that they could find, from a fire extinguisher to an ornamental narwhal tusk pulled from the wall. One person who saw the attack unfolding and rushed to help was a fellow conference participant, James Ford, a convicted murderer on day release from prison.
This weekend, Jack's father, David Merritt, wrote a tribute to his son, who he called "a beautiful spirit," on Twitter. He wrote: "My son, Jack, who was killed in this attack, would not wish his death to be used as the pretext for more draconian sentences or for detaining people unnecessarily."
Those words, pulling reason out of heartache, bear remembering. They're a challenge to a society stretched thin by ideological debate -- a challenge to mourn Jack's death without forgetting what he stood for in life.

Texto completo: "These programs have been very effective at reducing greenhouse gas emissions, including nitrogen oxides, and increasing the amount of zero-emission vehicles in the fleet."
Ariel Solaski
Chesapeake Bay Foundation attorney
The Chesapeake Bay Foundation has joined a lawsuit against the Environmental Protection Agency to challenge a Trump administration proposal that would pose air quality concerns for the Chesapeake Bay.
A coalition of environmental advocacy organizations filed suit Nov. 22 in Federal Circuit Court to block the EPA from withdrawing California's permission to set its own automobile emissions standards, which are stricter than federal rules.
The proposal to revoke the waiver, which was announced by the Trump Administration in September, matters because a number of Chesapeake Bay Watershed states also follow portions of the California standards, said John Surrick, a Chesapeake Bay Foundation spokesman.
Unlike under the federal Clean Water Act, which allows individual states to set their own rules as long as they are stricter than federal standards, the Clean Air Act does not allow states to supersede federal rules without a waiver, said Ariel Solaski, a staff attorney at the Chesapeake Bay Foundation.
The agency has granted California a waiver to adopt standards for light-duty vehicles for more than half a century, according to the EPA website.
EPA did not respond to an email requesting comment.
In total, 14 states have adopted parts of California's program, including Delaware, Maryland, New York and Pennsylvania, as well as the District of Columbia.
"Something that's really important to note is that these programs have been very effective at reducing greenhouse gas emissions, including nitrogen oxides, and increasing the amount of zero-emission vehicles in the fleet," Solaski said. "Part of the reason California was able to adopt the standard is ... they have to show compelling and extraordinary circumstances to show why they have a different program than the federal standards. EPA has found many times that those criteria is met."
Roughly one-third of the nitrogen pollution in the bay comes from the air, and about half of that is in the form of nitrogen oxides, said Beth McGee, senior water quality scientist at CBF. Nitrogen oxides are a group of seven gases that can create environmental health hazards when they react in the presence of sunlight or chemicals to form smog or acid rain.
Nitrogen oxides are released from vehicle exhaust. It's important to have high standards for vehicles in the bay region because tailpipe pollution behaves different from other polluting sources that shoot the gases up into the atmosphere, McGee said.
Tailpipe pollution from local vehicles is especially damaging to local waterways because it stays low to the ground, not travelling far, McGee said. Tailpipe pollution from vehicles in the watershed area can go directly into the bay and its tributaries.
Maryland adopted a Clean Cars Program modeled after the program in California in 2007. The program was estimated to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions collectively by about three more tons per day than the federal standard, according to the Maryland Department of the Environment.
The program achieves these reductions by requiring that cars pass strict tailpipe emissions tests. It also includes what is known as the "ZEV mandate" — a requirement that vehicle manufacturers put up for sale an increasing number of zero-emission vehicles (which include electric vehicles, hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles and plug-in electric hybrids) in the state each year.
Maryland has a goal of putting 60,000 zero-emission vehicles on the road by 2020 and 300,000 ZEVs on the road by 2025, according to MDE.
Collectively, the nine states (including Maryland) involved in a cross-country ZEV task force are aiming to put at least 3.3 million ZEVs on the roadways by 2025, according to the task force website.
Efforts by Maryland and other bay states to use mechanisms like the Clean Cars Program to improve their local air quality have impact on those states' abilities to adhere to the federal and state bay cleanup programs currently in place.
Air quality is a component of the Chesapeake Clean Water Blueprint, which sets pollution reduction milestones and consequences for failure upon the bay watershed states. Without a Clean Cars Program, Maryland would need to find another way to clean up the air to Blueprint standards by the deadline of 2025.
Because nitrogen oxides are also emitted by coal-fired power plants and the burning of natural gas, the source of the electricity powering zero-emission vehicles matters.
Therefore, CBF said they are also opposed to other rollbacks the Trump administration has made on regulations concerning air pollution.
"Conceptually, we don't really want to see any rollbacks in anything addressing greenhouse gases," McGee said.
In September, The New York Times reported that during President Trump's tenure, his administration has committed to rolling back 24 rules related to air pollution and emissions, as well as 18 rules concerning drilling and extraction. In total, the Trump administration has scheduled rollbacks for 85 environmental rules.
The rules are targeted for removal because they seen as burdensome to the fossil fuel industry and other big businesses, the Times reported.
CBF joins a coalition of NGOs in this litigation, including the Center for Biological Diversity, Communities for a Better Environment, Environment America, and the Union of Concerned Scientists.
"These programs have been very effective at reducing greenhouse gas emissions, including nitrogen oxides, and increasing the amount of zero-emission vehicles in the fleet."

Texto completo: Deregulation should be blamed for a fallen building -- not the worker who sounded the alarm.
This article has been updated to reflect news developments.
In early October, a worker posted a video of a building under construction that looked like it was about to collapse. It was slated to be a Hard Rock Hotel, just off the French Quarter, its temporary beams bent under the weight of the floors above.
"It's the best engineering," the worker said sarcastically in Spanish.
A few days later, parts of the upper floors of the building crumbled, killing three workers and injuring more than 20 people. One of those injured was Delmer Joel Ramírez Palma, a metal worker who had repeatedly reported safety issues to supervisors.
But after talking to the media about the shoddy work conditions; filing a lawsuit with other workers seeking damages; and becoming a witness in a federal workplace safety investigation, Immigration and Customs Enforcement deported him to Honduras on Friday. This has become a pattern in New Orleans since Hurricane Katrina in 2005, as well as across the country: I.C.E. is used as a tool to insulate private development projects from labor and safety regulations.
After the hurricane, much of New Orleans's black population, historically the bulk of the city's working class, was forced out of the city in part by failed policies like the Road Home program. So Latinx migrants, a majority of whom were undocumented, filled this void. They made up nearly half of the rebuilding work force and performed risky tasks in toxic conditions like gutting houses, repairing roofs and collecting trash.
To supposedly boost reconstruction efforts, the administration of George W. Bush temporarily suspended federal statutes that would have protected workers' health and wages. Around the same time, deportation rates in Louisiana rose significantly and continued under the Obama administration. That's partly because I.C.E. has retaliated against people who have exposed civil rights abuses.
That happened in August 2011, when Latinx employees of Louisiana Home Elevations gathered in the parking lot of an apartment complex to resolve a payment dispute with their contractor. Instead of receiving the thousands of dollars they were due, I.C.E. and local law enforcement detained the workers in a violent raid.
The company was eventually convicted of money laundering. But the migrant workers faced the harshest punishment. Some of the workers were eventually deported. None received any of the $ 10,000-plus they were collectively owed.
Around that time, the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Labor in the Obama administration reached an agreement that each agency must enforce labor law regardless of a worker's immigration status. The agreement also specified that I.C.E. would continue to take into account whether it received tips that were called in by someone wanting to retaliate against workers who voiced their labor rights.
But the Trump administration has defied these protections, instead putting in place draconian policies meant to target vulnerable migrant workers. An executive order in 2017 directed agencies to "make use of all available systems and resources" to enforce immigration policy and it ordered I.C.E. to hire 10,000 officers and agents. Meanwhile, federal worker protection agencies, like the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, remained understaffed, even though worker deaths are at a 10-year high.
This was the lead-up to the collapse of the Hard Rock Hotel.
An exposé on the incident shows how collusion between developers and federal agencies exacerbated this disaster. The construction company in charge of the project made headlines in 2013 after a New Orleans-area home it was working on collapsed, injuring several immigrant workers. The company changed its name but faced no major repercussions and continued to take on structurally unsound construction projects.
Two days after the building fell, the whistle-blower, Delmer Joel Ramírez Palma, was fishing in a suburb of New Orleans when the Fish and Wildlife Service stopped him for not having a license and turned him over to the Border Patrol, which turned him over to I.C.E. This overreach echoes the demands of the Trump administration's 2017 executive order. Mr. Ramírez's lawyer claims his arrest was connected to the media interview and the lawsuit seeking damages. I.C.E. denies this.
It's clear that prioritizing immigration enforcement over workplace safety enables risk and corruption. Washington must protect all workers regardless of immigration status. Developers should be regulated to ensure worker safety. And, in New Orleans, a city set to experience increasingly dangerous hurricanes and subsequent rebuilding under a climate in crisis, the government must protect the people who help rebuild it.

Texto completo: In a 65-page critique of early decisions made by William H. Rehnquist, who was then an associate justice on the US Supreme Court, Harvard Law School professor David L. Shapiro wasted no time getting to his point — which he tucked at the end of his first paragraph.
Basing his view on the justice's written opinions and votes, Mr. Shapiro wrote in 1976 that while Rehnquist was “a man of considerable intellectual power and independence of mind, the unyielding character of his ideology has had a substantial adverse effect" on his work.
Mr. Shapiro, the law school's William Nelson Cromwell professor emeritus when he died at 87 on Nov. 19, was considered a leading intellectual light in the field of federal courts philosophy and theory. And for nearly a half-century he coedited editions of “The Federal Courts and the Federal System," a key text for law students.
“David was the heart and soul of 'The Federal Courts and the Federal System,' " John F. Manning, dean of Harvard Law School, said in a statement.
“He really shaped the field of federal courts. David was able to bring out the complexity and nuance of the law for judges, scholars, and practitioners, and he always did so with clarity and insight," added Manning, who had joined Mr. Shapiro as a co-editor of the book's sixth edition, published in 2010.
Still, Mr. Shapiro's 1976 Harvard Law Review article on Rehnquist probably reached more eyes and ears as it was quoted or paraphrased often by scholars, politicians, and reporters — even in the chief justice's New York Times obituary.
In 1988, two years after Rehnquist was elevated to chief justice, Mr. Shapiro found himself preparing to appear in front of the jurist whose work he had examined in that article, which some conservatives and reporters had characterized as “blistering."
Mr. Shapiro had taken time away from Harvard Law School to serve as deputy US solicitor general, and he soon began arguing cases before the Supreme Court.
There he faced Rehnquist, whose performance in his early decisions “has been markedly below his own capabilities and has in large part been attributable to the inflexibility of his ideological commitments," Mr. Shapiro had written in his article.
Charles Fried, a Harvard Law School professor who, as solicitor general in the Reagan administration, hired Mr. Shapiro to serve as one of his deputies, recalled that some critics questioned the wisdom of hiring “somebody who had been so critical of the chief justice. Well, I knew Rehnquist and I think he couldn't give a damn and it wouldn't bother him a bit. It turned out there was no issue."
Certainly Mr. Shapiro was undaunted by the prospect. In the 40th anniversary report of his Harvard College class, he called his years as deputy solicitor general “an exhilarating time."
The success he enjoyed was partly because Mr. Shapiro was “a lawyer's lawyer," Amanda L. Tyler, one of his former students, wrote for a Harvard Law School publication when he retired in 2006.
As deputy solicitor general, “he must have been a compelling advocate, for he won cases that, even with the benefit of hindsight, seemed like uphill battles," added Tyler, who is now a professor at the University of California Berkeley School of Law.
Mr. Shapiro was “a gifted appellate advocate on behalf of the United States, arguing 10 cases before the Supreme Court," Noel Francisco, the current US solicitor general, said in a statement.
“As a colleague, he is remembered by those here at the department as a rigorous thinker, elegant writer, and warm mentor — open, straightforward, intellectually engaging, and all with good humor."
As a scholar, meanwhile, Mr. Shapiro exhibited enormous influence “in the classroom and intellectually," Fried said.
“There was a remarkable combination of common sense and intellectual rigor," Fried added. “And that was very influential and very inspiring to students — that somehow the two could be brought together."
In the classroom, Mr. Shapiro “wore his erudition lightly, but he was extremely erudite. He knew about all sorts of subjects that were not directly or even indirectly relevant to the subject matter," said Michael C. Dorf, a Cornell Law School professor.
If a student asked a question that was outside the scope of what Mr. Shapiro was teaching, “he would invariably know the answer," Dorf said, adding that he would then, off the cuff, recommend articles and other readings to further illuminate the issue the student had raised.
“He never seemed to be showing off," Dorf said. “It was just sort of matter of fact."
David Louis Shapiro was born in Manhattan, N.Y., in 1932, the only child of Louis Shapiro, an attorney, and Sarah Grabelsky, an art collector.
He received a bachelor's degree from Harvard College in 1954 and graduated summa cum laude three years later from Harvard Law School, where he worked for the Harvard Law Review and was awarded the Fay Diploma, which goes to the student with the highest combined average for three years.
Before returning to Harvard to teach, Mr. Shapiro worked at the Covington & Burling firm in Washington, D.C., and served from 1962 to 1963 as a clerk to John M. Harlan, an associate justice of the US Supreme Court.
“After all of three weeks in my new profession, I have concluded that teaching is an exciting and challenging profession," he wrote for a Harvard class report after joining the Harvard Law School faculty in 1963.
In 1954, he married Jane Bennett, who for many years ran the Wendell Street Gallery in Cambridge, where they lived.
Their daughter, Lynn Mayson Shapiro, who died of cancer in 2011, had been a dancer, choreographer, poet, and memoirist. She had married Erik Friedlander, and they had a daughter, Ava.
“My wife is an art dealer, my daughter a choreographer, my son-in-law a cellist and composer, and his father a photographer," Mr. Shapiro wrote for a 1994 class report. “As for me, that hemisphere of my brain seems to be missing."
A Harvard Law School service will be announced for Mr. Shapiro, whose wife, son-in-law, and granddaughter are his only survivors.
“David was also a law professor's law professor," Dorf wrote in a tribute on his Dorf on Law blog.
Mr. Shapiro was successful in the classroom even though he spoke in a raspy whisper, due to a rare ailment that had required surgery on his vocal chords, and he used a microphone and speaker through much of his teaching career.
He was known for his “kind of a wry, understated sense of humor," Fried said, and the vocal challenge was no exception.
“When I picture him in my mind, his shoulders are bouncing up and down as he laughs, typically at a joke he made at his own expense," Dorf wrote.
To put students at ease as he used a microphone in class, Mr. Shapiro sometimes relied on well-placed quips.
In an interview, Dorf recalled that “one day he comes to class and says in his whispery, raspy voice, 'I have to apologize today. I have laryngitis,' " Mr. Shapiro paused a beat and added with a smile, “I know what you're thinking: 'How does he know?' "

Texto completo: Diabetes, whether Type 1 or Type 2, may be the most underappreciated, misunderstood and poorly treated of all common medical problems, and many of the more than 30 million Americans affected by it are paying dearly with their health and lives as a result.
Contrary to what many people think, diabetes is not just a disease of abnormal blood sugar control caused by a lack of insulin or an inadequate response to this crucial hormone.
Rather, diabetes is a chronic, progressive disorder with potentially devastating effects throughout the body. When inadequately controlled, it can injure many critical bodily systems and result in costly, life-disrupting and sometimes fatal consequences. Both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes, especially when poorly managed, can damage the heart, kidneys, eyes and nerves and result in a heart attack or stroke, kidney failure, blindness, crippling neuropathy and amputations.
Yet a recent national study found that at least three out of four people with diabetes do not adequately control the four major factors that increase the risk of serious complications: blood glucose, blood pressure, blood cholesterol and smoking. Furthermore, despite significant advances in the delivery of diabetes care and availability of more effective medications, the study revealed that since 2005 for the nation as a whole, there has been little or no improvement in managing diabetes and preventing or delaying the damage it can cause.
David Haitkin, a 65-year-old Brooklynite, takes great care to manage his diabetes. Found in his 40s to have Type 1 disease, which requires daily treatment with insulin, he keeps his weight, blood pressure and cholesterol under control, doesn’t smoke and gets daily exercise walking his dog and walking to work.
After checking his fasting blood sugar level every morning, Haitkin said he administers the appropriate dose of long-acting insulin. He starts his day with a breakfast of oatmeal and eats a regulated amount of mostly complex carbohydrates three times a day “so I don’t end up starved for them.” He relies on healthful fats like olive oil, avocado and nuts, restricts meat portions to 4 ounces or less and eats fish as often as possible. He also takes the blood pressure drug ramipril to help protect his kidneys, and has his eyes examined and the circulation in his feet and legs checked regularly. He said he’s never had a blood sugar crisis - either a level too high or too low - and so far all body systems seem to be functioning normally.
Then he added a very telling observation: “I’ve always had good health insurance at every job and the luxury to take care of myself. Now though, for a lot of people, that’s being taken away.”
Each of the three diabetes experts I spoke with mentioned insurance problems as a major hindrance for many patients who need to keep their diabetes under control. It is the rare policy that covers consultations for diet and exercise, which can reduce the need for medications and require more time than the 15 or 20 minutes allotted to a doctor visit. But even needed medications are often out of reach financially.
“Having good health insurance is the strongest link to receiving comprehensive diabetes care,” Pooyan Kazemian of Massachusetts General Hospital, lead author of the new study, told me. “Treatment of diabetes is getting more expensive every day. The newer drugs that control blood sugar with fewer side effects are super expensive, with an average monthly cost of about $1,000, and people without health insurance don’t go to the doctor.”
Dr. Mohammed K. Ali, a preventive medicine specialist at Emory University who wrote a commentary about the study, said, “Many people are on high-deductible plans that don’t cover a lot of things that could help them. They may go to the pharmacy with a prescription and discover it’s not covered by their insurance or they can’t afford the copay.
“Yet,” he added, “we’re dealing with a chronic, progressive disease, and if you’re not on top of it, it will get on top of you very quickly.”
Kazemian explained, “Having a persistently high blood sugar level can damage the kidneys, heart, nerves and eyes; consuming a healthy diet with good portion control and getting regular exercise are critical to managing blood sugar.”
Rozalina G. McCoy, endocrinologist and primary care doctor at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, said, “Diabetes is not just a clinical disease - it’s a public health disease that is multifaceted and very hard to manage.” High levels of blood sugar cause inflammation and damage blood vessels, both large and small, she said, and these vessels are found everywhere in the body, which is why so many systems are affected.
“But normalizing blood sugar alone will not fix the problem,” McCoy emphasized. “High blood pressure increases pounding on blood vessels, high cholesterol causes inflammation and blockages, and smoking also causes inflammation.”
The new study, published in October in JAMA Internal Medicine, analyzed data gathered by the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 1,742 nonpregnant adults with known diabetes and 746 adults with diabetes that had not been previously diagnosed. The data revealed that there had been no significant improvement in the diagnosis or treatment of diabetes from 2005 through 2016.
While 70% achieved target levels of blood pressure control, less than two-thirds of those with diabetes maintained their blood sugar at desired levels, the study found. The best news: 85% of diabetes patients were nonsmokers.
All told, success in reaching target goals for managing diabetes was poorest among young adults and minorities as well as those lacking health insurance.
“In general, younger patients are more likely to be undertreated and older patients often get too much care and are overtreated,” McCoy said.

Texto completo: With limited resources (time, money, equipment, creative energy, talent), shifting attention away from peddling ho-hum wares to a highly differentiated and desirable value proposition could become the game-changer you're looking for.
With our Thanksgiving feasts behind us, 'tis the season of 2020 business planning. Ironically, the theme of gratitude may actually be our best strategy in the new year.
In working with many businesses in different industries, I often hear the same refrains: "We need to sell more," "we need better marketing," "we need to cut costs."
The one theme I hear far less frequently is around being grateful for, and truly delighting customers. In other words, leaders often put their focus on internal factors (sales, marketing, operations) rather than a relentless drive to better serve clients through higher value products and services.
If you have an average, mediocre product or services offering, it likely requires a rock star sales team and a Superbowl marketing budget to hit your revenue targets. On the other hand, if you craft an irresistible offering, superhero sales efforts are not required. Simply put, applying our energies in a customer-centric manner may be the most productive investment we can make.
With limited resources (time, money, equipment, creative energy, talent), shifting attention away from peddling ho-hum wares to a highly differentiated and desirable value proposition could become the game-changer you're looking for. We can't forget that we're all in the service business, so the best way to grow is to appreciate — and focus on — our customers.
Focus on these 10 client-centric questions 1. What is the biggest pain point we're solving for the customer?
2. What unmet needs currently exist from our customers' current suppliers?
3. If the client could waive their magic-wand and design a solution, what might that look like? And how close can our offering get to that ideal vision?
4. What would make our offering so compelling, the client would ignore the lowest cost bidder?

6. What is our single most important point of differentiation vs. our top competitors?
7. How could our service get our main client promoted? Fired?
8. If it were five years from now and a competitor came in and totally crushed us, what might they be offering compared to our current value proposition?

Texto completo: For the Monitor
During the last days of August 2004, my wife and I were vacationing on the coast of Maine. As it happened, the Republican National Convention was taking place in New York City that week.
The presidential election that November would be between Republican President George W. Bush and John F. Kerry, Democratic U.S. senator from Massachusetts.
On Aug. 30, the opening day of the convention, I purchased a copy of the New York Times, which was covering the proceedings. I also bought the Times on the following days of the convention.
Prominently featured in the Sept. 1 edition was coverage of delegates on the convention floor mocking Sen. Kerry's Vietnam War service as a U.S. Navy lieutenant in charge of a swift boat patrol operation. Several right-wing delegates gleefully wore Band-Aids on their faces with purple hearts drawn on them in an abhorrent attempt to tarnish Kerry's receipt of three Purple Heart medals.
The disrespect for Kerry's military records persisted throughout the convention, despite protests from the Military Order of the Purple Heart. Republican Arizona Sen. John McCain and many other veterans vigorously denounced the attacks on Kerry's service.
The seaside peacefulness I was relishing immediately switched to anger as I read news of the convention's dishonest goings-on.
At a 1967 forum in Manchester, a young Marine from Maine and I had been presented the Purple Heart by Commandant of the Marine Corps Gen. Wallace M. Greene Jr. Though I had become opposed to the rotten war, I held great respect for the medal's recognition of those wounded in U.S. wars.
The Purple Heart is also presented to the families of military personnel killed in battle along with a folded funeral flag. It is our country's oldest military decoration, originating with Gen. George Washington, known then as the Badge of Military Merit. Contrary to news media anchors and others, the Purple Heart medal is not “won.” It is not a prize for an accomplishment. It is an award of recognition.
It irks me that so many Republican leaders have and continue to feign patriotic superiority while discrediting those who have served during wartime. Instances of this are numerous, and even include veterans of their own political party – the late Sen. John McCain, for example.
During his 2008 presidential campaign, McCain caught grief from those questioning whether he was a “natural born citizen” for having been born in Panama where his father was stationed in the U.S. Navy. He had been wounded in Vietnam and became a long-term POW in Hanoi.
Infamously, in 2015 during Donald Trump's presidential run, Trump insulted McCain for having been captured.
In his 2006 campaign for re-election as a Democrat, the late Pennsylvania congressman John Murtha's service in the Marine Corps took scathing abuse from his opponents, despite his two Purple Hearts and other combat medals for service in Vietnam.
Max Cleland, at age 25, became a triple amputee from the Vietnam War. He was awarded the Purple Heart and several other medals for gallantry. When running for re-election as a Democrat to the U.S. Senate in 2002, his patriotism was outwardly slandered by his Republican opponent. Cleland lost re-election by a slight margin. He went on to support John Kerry's 2004 presidential candidacy.
Tammy Duckworth lost both legs after being shot down in Iraq piloting a Black Hawk helicopter in 2004. Born in Thailand, Duckworth was scorned by her Republican opponent in her 2006 run for Congress for having an Asian mother. She lost that election but was later elected to the U.S. House of Representatives and is currently a Democratic senator from Illinois.
In 2016, candidate Donald Trump shamelessly belittled the U.S. Gold Star parents of Humayun Khan, a Muslim soldier killed by a suicide bomber in Iraq. The fallen soldier's father denounced Trump in a powerful speech during the Democratic National Convention that July.
Again, in October 2017, Trump made insensitive remarks to the widow of a U.S. soldier killed in an ambush in Niger, telling her coldly that he “knew what he signed up for.” Unable to recall the soldier's name, Trump displayed no empathy.
And most recently during the House impeachment inquiry, U.S. Army Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman was disrespected by Republicans in their smearing, vindictive questions. Vindman, a Ukrainian-American immigrant, is the recipient of the Purple Heart and several other combat medals from his service in Iraq. Vindman serves on Trump's National Security Council.
It makes me wonder who will be next to take verbal shrapnel from right-wingers, many who are chickenhawks – those who support wars but find ways to weasel out from serving themselves.

Texto completo: Readers urge Republicans "to put country over party" and cite Vladimir Putin and "Seinfeld."
To the Editor:
I have been sick at heart and sick to my stomach ever since Donald Trump assumed the presidency, and I watched the impeachment hearings over two weeks with an ever-deepening sense of foreboding: Will he once more dodge any accountability or consequence for his outright lies and his despicable actions?
It is hard for me to believe that the Republican Party, in particular the Senate Republicans, will continue to stand behind this man, that they will enable him to do continuing damage to our country and our institutions. Republicans have sold out their principles and made a deal with the devil.
And for what? So they can get re-elected? So they can pack the courts with conservative judges? I am enraged when I read how some Republicans privately say they loathe Donald Trump but in front of the cameras they are his champion.
Representative Adam Schiff, in his most eloquent and moving closing statement, asked where are the Howard Bakers of the Republican Party? To that I will add: Where are Senators Lisa Murkowski, Susan Collins, Ben Sasse? How wonderful and patriotic it would be for these senators to stand in the Senate well and say publicly that they condemn Donald Trump. This is their opportunity to put country over party. What will they do?

To the Editor:
I am a lifetime Republican and have never been more concerned about my country or my party. The Republican Party previously endorsed impeachment for obstructing a congressional inquiry into an attempted burglary of an opponent's office for political dirt. That was Richard Nixon. The Republican Party previously endorsed impeachment for having an affair with an intern and lying about it. That was Bill Clinton.
Yet today the Republican Party does not support impeachment for coercing a foreign government to interfere in our electoral process, jeopardizing our national security, obstructing Congress's investigation and lying about it.
The facts are clear. Mr. Trump is as guilty as Mr. Nixon and Mr. Clinton. And Mr. Trump's offense is far, far worse.
It's time for politicians to do what's right ... for their own integrity, for their oath of office, for love of our country and for the future of our democracy.
Bruce R. Crawford
Roswell, Ga.
To the Editor:
It has been reported that a group of Senate Republicans met with White House officials to plot strategy for a possible impeachment trial. Are we to understand that certain members of the Senate, jurors in a future impeachment trial, are plotting strategy with the defendant?
Stephen Polit
Belmont, Mass.
To the Editor:
It's terrifying that as hopeful a writer as Paul Krugman has apparently given up on any of the Republicans in Congress seeing fit to punish a president who has ventured far beyond permissible boundaries of political behavior ("Trump and His Corrupt Old Party," column, Nov. 22).
As Adam Schiff noted in the just completed hearings, the biggest difference between the 1974 impeachment inquiry into Richard Nixon and the present effort is that back then there were more than a few members of the president's party who considered the truth more important than partisan loyalty. Today, for reasons Mr. Krugman lists -- above all, money -- there seem to be hardly any.
The political scientist Daniel Ziblatt wrote that the single biggest factor in keeping a democracy healthy is having a strong center-right (hence, "conservative") party that believes in the preservation of norms like rule of law.
It does seem that what we're witnessing is a Republican Party that is so scared of America's multiethnic future that it has given up on truth and the rule of law. God help us.
Larry Houghteling
Newtonville, Mass.
To the Editor:
In order to broaden public support for impeachment, the Democrats are stretching federal bribery law, which involves the corrupt offering of benefits to federal officials, so that it also covers benefits to foreign leaders. As long as they're embellishing they might consider the way that their favorite witnesses -- ambassadors -- often get their jobs: through massive donations to presidential candidates. That common practice seems closer to the statutory meaning of bribery than any benefits offered to the president of Ukraine.
Barry Latzer

The writer is professor emeritus of criminal justice at John Jay College of Criminal Justice.
To the Editor:
The impeachment inquiry in the House must not end without access to executive branch documents and witnesses. Otherwise it sets a precedent that Congress accepts the president's baseless claim of total executive privilege.
Without unfettered access to executive branch officials and documents, the power of impeachment is crippled. If Richard Nixon had been able to hide the Watergate tapes and other White House records and staff testimony, neither the break-in nor the cover-up could have been traced to the president.
Worse, closing the books now will confirm this president's belief that he can misuse power and break any laws without serious consequences.
Representative Adam Schiff must wait for judicial resolution of the president's claim of privilege. That will ensure a proper investigation and, at the same time, preserve the impeachment mechanism that protects us from an executive branch gone rogue.
Susan P. Myers
Elkins Park, Pa.
To the Editor:
President Trump is Vladimir Putin's patsy. Blinded by a compulsion to become the first American oligarch, Mr. Trump cannot see how expertly he is being played. The American president struts around attacking those he perceives as weak. Yet it is the bully who is vulnerable.
The impeachment hearings showcased extraordinary Americans who exemplify the very people bullies like Mr. Trump fear. As the Bully Project asserts, "Adult bullies target people who are good at their job and excel beyond them ... especially those who have high morals and integrity."
And who fears the bully? Not only his current victim, but those around him who worry that they will be humiliated as the next target. In today's America, we call them Republicans.
Meanwhile, Mr. Putin, the master manipulator, knows a bully's ways and sees how he can exploit Mr. Trump's desire to be an omnipotent ruler like himself. But Mr. Trump, and many Americans, have been no match for the Russian propaganda machine. Thus our democracy hangs by a thread.
Barbara Chiarello
Austin, Tex.
To the Editor:
President Trump's goal was getting Ukraine to announce an investigation into the Bidens, not to do the investigation. This makes perfect sense. The announcement would be the opportunity for lots of Trump Twitter comments, talking points for Kellyanne Conway and sound bites for Trump supporters, until the phrase "Biden Corruption" was thoroughly implanted in the public's consciousness.
But if Ukraine actually performed an honest, good-faith investigation of the Bidens and found no corruption, a likely outcome, Mr. Trump's false assertions would be exposed. It would be much safer for the president to pressure Ukraine into making a big announcement, and then discourage it from following through.
Bruce Harville
Madison, Wis.
To the Editor:
Re "Trump's Defense: Malign Accusers and Attack Facts" (front page, Nov. 23):
I never thought I would refer to "Seinfeld" to help me understand President Trump and certain members of Congress. However, there is an episode in which Jerry is confronted with the problem of "beating" a lie-detector test and turns to George for advice.
"Jerry, just remember, it's not a lie if you believe it!" his friend tells him.

Texto completo: Fifty years ago this week, "Buck White" opened, and very quickly closed. What does this footnote to theater history still have to tell us?
So, as the sportscaster Howard Cosell used to ask great boxers: What went wrong out there, champ?
When the stage musical "Buck White" opened at the George Abbott Theater on Dec. 2, 1969, it had three knockout draws: timeliness, a strong track record and its star, the charismatic heavyweight Muhammad Ali.
Set at a meeting of a black militant group, the show was based on "Big Time Buck White," a play credited to the white actor and writer Joseph Dolan Tuoti that had been developed at Budd Schulberg's Watts Writers Workshop in Los Angeles and had enjoyed successful runs there, in Philadelphia and Off Broadway.
The musical adaptation had already played to good reviews in San Francisco. The producer was the future Broadway powerhouse Zev Bufman, fresh off "Jimmy Shine," starring a post-"Graduate" and pre-"Midnight Cowboy" Dustin Hoffman.
Among the cast: Ted Ross, a future Tony Award winner for "The Wiz"; Charles Weldon, who would become the Negro Ensemble Company's artistic director; and the actor-producer Ron Rich, who played Luther "Boom Boom" Jackson in Billy Wilder's film "The Fortune Cookie."
Making his Broadway debut as composer and lyricist was the multithreat artist and activist Oscar Brown Jr., whose songs had been covered by Nina Simone and Mahalia Jackson. Lorraine Hansberry, who had earlier worked with Brown on the show "Kicks and Co.," called him "a startling genius."
Ali, a devout Muslim, had been stripped of his boxing title in 1967, having refused to join the army and go to Vietnam. Though he still couldn't fight professionally, he was ripe for a comeback. He saw the play thanks to his friendship with Ron Rich, then hung out with the cast backstage and joined them for some impromptu songs.
"I was amazed at his ability to carry a tune -- his voice was as attention-grabbing as his charm as a fighter," said Bufman, now 89, who says he came up with the idea to turn the play into a musical and bring Ali on board.
Bufman, who lives on an island north of Seattle, recalled brokering negotiations with the Nation of Islam to let Ali make his Broadway debut. He would play the show's eponymous, messianic leader, who appears at a meeting of a disorganized group called B.A.D. (Beautiful Alleluia Days) and galvanizes them with fiery speeches and songs including "(It's All Over Now) Mighty Whitey." Brown's wife, Jean Pace, would co-direct.
The New York Times published about a dozen articles about "Buck White." The show made the cover of Jet magazine; the cast was booked on "The Ed Sullivan Show"; Buddah Records signed on for the cast album. Bufman told Jet that Ali would star in a movie version.
"The [last] preview was the most astonishing theatrical event I ever lived through," said Bufman. "Ali was brilliant. Forget Harry Belafonte. Forget anyone who ever did 'Porgy and Bess.' I have never seen anyone or anything like it, the way he captured the stage with a charisma that got people on their feet for five straight minutes.
"We went to the dressing rooms, we hugged, we celebrated," he added. "We thought we had a hit."
Several of Brown's children were in the opening night audience.
"They had these streamers and sirens and rockets that went 'Aaooooooowww! Boom!' when Ali made his entrance," recalled Maggie Brown, a singer and songwriter who comanages the Oscar Brown Jr. Archive Project in Chicago with her sister Africa Brown. "It was like fireworks in the theater."
Four days later, "Buck White" closed; today, it's hard to find much evidence the show even existed -- no cast album; no movie either.
And Tuoti never had another script produced. "He became a drug addict and a drifter. He led a very sad life; he was in and out of prison," his sister Susan DeWaters said recently. "It was an American tragedy."
Howard University's Moorland-Spingarn Research Center holds what might be the one remaining copy of the "Buck White" script. The only songs you can hear to get a flavor of the show are "Black Balloons" on Syl Johnson's 1970 album, "Is It Because I'm Black?"; "Mighty Whitey," the B side of a 45 recorded by the show's musical director Merl Saunders with the Man Child Singers; and the anthemic "We Came in Chains" which Ali performed on "Ed Sullivan" after the show was already shuttered.
Brown, who died in 2005, kept writing musicals and making albums and TV appearances, but never got back to Broadway.
So what happened?
Critical reception had been tepid -- Clive Barnes in The Times praised the "brilliant" cast but said the musicalization drowned what had been a powerful play in a "frothy sea of well-meaning clichés."
Still, the reviews don't entirely explain why the most-talked about show on Broadway vanished to the point where it doesn't even have its own Wikipedia page.
Leigh Montville, the author of "Sting Like a Bee: Muhammad Ali Vs. The United States of America, 1966-1971," devoted part of a chapter of his book to "Buck White."
"There was a lot more substance" to the show "than people gave it credit for," he said in an interview.
Was the show "too black for the Great White Way"? That's what Brown told his daughter Maggie, she said, noting that producers sometimes revive forgotten musicals, but rarely for those written by black artists who didn't have the resources or connections of white composers.
Was it too radical? The show was picketed and subjected to hate mail by white people who considered Ali a draft dodger and black people who called him a sellout. Ron Rich contends the F.B.I. got involved. "Ed Sullivan came to my dressing room," Rich said. "He said, 'I think [J. Edgar] Hoover put pressure to shut the show down."'
Or was "Buck White," like plenty of ambitious Off Broadway hits, just not ready for the big time?
"Yes, it touched upon the change in Afro-American attitudes in the country, and I'm sure that was unsettling to people," said Jack Landron, who was fired from the show before opening but had a long career as an actor and (under the name Jackie Washington) as a folk singer. "Had it been a great show, people could have forgiven that. It closed because it wasn't good."
Or perhaps, in casting Ali, the producer made a key miscalculation, hiring a star accustomed to training for a different sort of performance.
"The preview was so great, but then came opening night," Bufman said. "Ali went onstage and he was somebody else; he went through the motions. The cast followed his tempo." There was no charisma. There was no standing ovation.
"I went backstage and Ali looked at me, and he said, 'Boss, we're in trouble, huh?"' Bufman continued. "I said, 'Tell me what happened.' He said, 'I fought my fight yesterday at the preview. I came to fight again tonight but I was done."'
More than anything, the disappearance of "Buck White" demonstrates the ephemerality of an art form that, after the final curtain call, exists only in the memories of those who've seen a show and of others who wonder what might have been or what went wrong.
The show that followed "Buck White" at the George Abbott was "Gantry," a musical adaptation of Sinclair Lewis's novel "Elmer Gantry," starring Robert Shaw and Rita Moreno.
It opened and closed on Valentine's Day, 1970. That spring, the wrecking ball arrived on West 54th Street, and soon, the George Abbott Theater was gone, too.

Texto completo: Vaping is an epidemic.
It is being marketed to our kids, even if it can kill and seriously injure them. At last count, 47 people have died from vaping and more than 2,000 have vaping-related lung injuries nationwide. Some of those cases involved vaping products containing vitamin E acetate.
This is an urgent call to action. I recently asked the Arizona Board of Regents to implement policies prohibiting the use and sale of vaping products on campus, and on land owned and leased by our universities to third parties.
Let's start with the data. Seventy-seven percent of these cases involve patients under age 35, with 15% under 18, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And this product has only been on the market for a handful of years.
Why? Because a single vaping device can produce as much addictive nicotine as 18 cigarettes. Almost a pack.
Originally created to provide adults an alternative to tobacco, vaping companies have found a gold mine in marketing to younger people.
Their denials fall hollow while producing flavors such as gummy bear and strawberry milk. The New York Times's Nov. 24 front-page story exposed the industry's intentionality of marketing to young people — and yes, the breathtaking profits in doing so.
The trajectory of use of vaping devices has grown like a hockey stick — with use among young people doubling in each of the last two years. Currently, more than a third of all high school students, and more than half in many high schools vape. Fifteen percent of junior high schoolers use the product, and it has been observed all the way down to fifth grade.
If it sounds like a rerun of the tobacco industry, well, it is. They have the same goal — to addict the next generation. The same marketing. And, it turns out, even the same money. The nation's largest tobacco company, Altria, recently purchased more than a third interest in Juul, the nation's largest vaping company.
In the early 1970s, my father was the first senior federal government official to warn against the addictive and destructive qualities of tobacco and led the effort to print a warning label on the side of cigarette packages. Imagine how many millions of deaths might have been avoided had we taken heed earlier.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has warned against vaping. The American Medical Association has followed suit. Health professionals across the country are urging action before it is too late.
My goal with the Board of Regents is to follow that good advice by restricting the use and sale of all nicotine products on university property. The universities do have prohibitions in place, but they vary. This proposal creates a single, consistent and comprehensive policy for both tobacco and vaping. Further, it extends to university-owned land off campus.
There are more than 30 points of sale within three miles of our three university campuses — Arizona State University, University of Arizona and Northern Arizona University — and 14 within a half mile. Why? Because distributors go to where customers are located.
Some resist overly broad prohibitions because some adults are using it to quit smoking.
Some consider any restrictive measures to be a restraint on personal liberty.
This proposal doesn't make it a policy banning vaping among students. It sets a policy that prohibits individuals from vaping on campus and making the products a little less convenient to obtain. It is a modest restriction of personal liberty to make a major statement: Vaping is a stupid choice. It is addictive, and it can kill you.
I liken it to highway guardrails. These provide safety and a strong suggestion. It makes a bad choice harder, but not prohibitive.
I think we owe that to these students and their parents who entrust their children to our care.

Paul Krugman: Why Trump should hate Thanksgiving

Texto completo: So the imaginary “war on Christmas” wasn’t enough. Donald Trump and Fox News are now accusing progressives of waging a war on Thanksgiving, too, based on, well, nothing. But do Trump and his band of bigots even understand what Thanksgiving is about? If they did, they would hate this most American of holidays.
After all, the Pilgrims were refugees fleeing persecution by the English monarchy, which at the time was still an autocratic regime. They were, in other words, exactly the kind of people Trump and company want to keep out.
Furthermore, the traditional portrait of the first Thanksgiving is as a moment of racial tolerance and multiculturalism: European immigrants sharing a feast with Native Americans. That moment didn’t last: Much of New England’s native population was wiped out over the next few decades. And such an outcome may well have been inevitable. But we still celebrate the tale of a benign meeting of races and cultures.
Thanksgiving became an official holiday thanks to an 1863 proclamation by Abraham Lincoln. This was only a few months after he signed the Emancipation Proclamation and just a few weeks before he would deliver the Gettysburg Address, in which he declared that America is a nation dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. So Thanksgiving as we now celebrate it also commemorates the struggle to end slavery.
Finally, Thanksgiving is thoroughly nondenominational. Lincoln’s proclamation gave thanks to Almighty God but was vague about the Almighty’s nature. There’s nothing about the holiday that reserves it for believers in any particular religion, or in fact any formal religion at all, and it’s open to all cultures. The New York Times recently reported on the growing popularity of Thanksgiving turkey prepared in the style of Chinese roast duck; nothing could be truer to the holiday’s spirit.
Thanksgiving is, in short, a truly American holiday. Not only is it unique to our country, it’s a celebration of the values that actually make America great: openness to people who look or act differently, religious tolerance, sympathy for the persecuted, belief in human equality.
True, all too often we pay only lip service to these values; there have been many dark chapters in our nation’s history. But we’ve always managed to emerge from the darkness. Sometimes that emergence took generations; the Jim Crow era in the South lasted close to a century and isn’t entirely gone even now. Still, time and again, from the abolitionists to the civil rights movement, from women’s suffrage to LGBTQ rights, America’s ideals have eventually prevailed, and we have returned to the nation’s core values.
We are now living through another of those dark chapters. Trump and company are, without question, white nationalists whose values are far closer to those of European blood-and-soil authoritarians than they are to the American tradition. And the entire Republican Party appears ready to back Trump no matter how completely he betrays not just American values but American interests.
Furthermore, there’s no guarantee that we will emerge from this dark chapter as the nation we used to be. It’s true that Trump is an unusually unpopular president; but his approval rating, at around 40% or a bit more, is if anything higher than the approval Viktor Orban commanded as he dismantled Hungary’s democracy. And Trump, like European white nationalists, is doing his best to remove all the guardrails that were supposed to limit abuse of power, while delegitimizing all opposition.
But while an alarming number of Americans seem OK with this authoritarian program and embrace of intolerance, the rest of the nation seems reassuringly committed to an open society.
Trump’s efforts to spread fear of brown people actually seem to have backfired: Popular belief that immigrants make a positive contribution to America is at its highest point in decades.
Furthermore, while Trump may have as many supporters as rising autocrats abroad, he faces much more determined resistance. Opposition to Hungary’s Fidesz or Poland’s Law and Justice party seemed demoralized and disorganized from the start; Trump’s opposition has, when all is said and done, been spirited and cohesive. And the reason isn’t just personalities; impressive as Nancy Pelosi and Adam Schiff are, both the Democratic midterm victory and the effectiveness of the impeachment inquiry ultimately reflect the commitment of many ordinary Americans to sustaining our core values.
That said, we could still very well lose it all. But then that was also true when Lincoln first made Thanksgiving a national holiday. Even as he celebrated America’s strengths, the nation was in the depths of civil war, and despite Gettysburg and Vicksburg, Union victory was far from assured.
The point is that Thanksgiving isn’t a celebration of national triumph; it’s a celebration of the better angels of America’s nature. That’s why it’s a holiday true patriots, who believe in our nation’s underlying values, should love — and one people like Trump and his supporters should hate.

Ruffalo mesmerizes as lawyer fighting DuPont 'Dark Waters' *** 1/2

Texto completo: If the story of "Dark Waters" sounds familiar, to a certain extent it is. But this film is not business as usual, with the presence of director Todd Haynes and star Mark Ruffalo the key reasons why.
On the most basic level "Dark Waters" is a whistleblower story, the latest in a genre of doing-the-right-thing scenarios that includes such popular films as "Erin Brockovich," "The Insider" and even "All the President's Men."
Inspired by an article in the New York Times Magazine, "Dark Waters" could have simply followed the template of the story's upbeat headline, "The Lawyer Who Became DuPont's Worst Nightmare," telling the story of attorney Robert Bilott, who worked for more than 20 years to expose decades of heedless environmental contamination dreadful enough to cost the chemical giant $670 million in fines.
Ruffalo, an actor with an activist bent, read that story and decided to star in a movie version, becoming lead producer and hiring Haynes, a director whose 1995 "Safe" was ecologically prescient, and a filmmaker who never does anything the expected way.
Working with screenwriters Mario Correa and Matthew Michael Carnahan, Haynes has constructed a dark, edgy film, disturbing and meant to be, a real-life horror show that details the impunity with which DuPont put profits above the known harm its chemicals were causing.
"Dark Waters" also focuses on the wrenching, disconcerting consequences of doing the right thing, on the number of grinding years of unrelenting, life-changing pressure - more than 20 in this case - that were needed to even begin to make a difference.
One of the many ironies in this story is that Bilott was in almost all ways the least likely guy to become the environmental hero.
Yes, Bilott (played by Ruffalo) was an attorney, but the Cincinnati firm he worked for was old-school conservative to the core. Recently made a partner, his area of specialization was defending big corporations rather than suing them.
That all began to change on a day in 1998 when gruff and furious Wilbur Tennant (a brilliant Bill Camp), a farmer from Parkersburg, West Virginia, who was acquainted with Bilott's grandmother, made the trip to Cincinnati and insisted "I want a lawyer."
Though he's a new father and his wife, Sarah (an expert Anne Hathaway), is not sure why he's even bothering, Bilott feels compelled to take the drive to Parkersburg.
Tennant has both physical evidence and videotape recordings of the horrors that have been visited on his herd of cattle, 190 of which he has buried. Tennant feels that the damage is caused by the neighboring Dry Run Landfill, where the Washington Works factory operated by DuPont deposits its chemical waste.
Before making what he views as a friendly colleague-to-colleague request to a pal at DuPont, Bilott runs his plan past his superior, the buttoned down Tom Terp (Tim Robbins, expert as well).
Neither man has any idea of what they, and their firm, are getting into, though when a DuPont functionary warns Bilott that "you're flushing your career down the toilet," he starts to get the idea.
That's because, as the lawyer finds out, a chemical variously known as PFOA or C8 and essential to the manufacture of Teflon, is being released into the Parkersburg water supply.
Ruffalo is splendid at projecting the unusual combination of bred-in-the-bone idealism with mulish stubbornness that made it impossible for Bilott to walk away.

Texto completo: A Cannes prize winner hits Netflix. And a political drama with Adam Driver and Annette Bening comes to Amazon.
What's Streaming
ATLANTICS (2019) Stream on Netflix. This debut feature from the French-Senegalese director Mati Diop won one of the top prizes at this year's Cannes Film Festival. Set in Dakar, the film centers on Ada (Mama Sané), a young woman with a problem: She's in love with Souleiman (Ibrahima Traoré), a construction worker, but she's engaged to a businessman. The plot kicks off when Souleiman unexpectedly sets off on a boat bound for Spain. "It's around this point that 'Atlantics' transforms itself, almost imperceptibly, into something entirely different from what it had seemed to be," A.O. Scott wrote in his review for The New York Times. "Without letting go of its grounding in the lives and desires of its characters, especially Ada, it becomes an unusual kind of ghost story, more unnerving than terrifying, a supernatural fable of resistance and revenge."
HARLEY QUINN Stream on DC Universe. The DC Comics super villain Harley Quinn will return in the flesh early next year in the live action movie "Birds of Prey." In the meantime, comic fans can turn to this new, adult-aimed animated series, in which that supervillain -- the sometimes sidekick to the Joker -- is voiced by Kaley Cuoco. Lake Bell, Alan Tudyk, J.B. Smoove and other big names also lend their pipes.
THE REPORT (2019) Stream on Amazon. "Find out exactly what they did," Annette Bening says to Adam Driver in this political drama. How he goes about doing that is what the rest of the movie chronicles. Bening plays Senator Dianne Feinstein, and in that scene she's asking a staffer, Daniel J. Jones (Driver), to investigate the C.I.A.'s endorsement of torture in the aftermath of Sept. 11. The movie, written and directed by Scott Z. Burns (whose writing credits include "The Informant!" and "The Laundromat"), attempts to turn that very complicated investigation into exciting cinema. How successful it is at doing that is open to discussion. "Saturated with details and counterterrorism jargon, crammed full of real-world characters some would prefer to forget (looking at you, John Yoo), this swampy exposé is so tangled in red tape and competing political agendas that it can barely breathe," Jeannette Catsoulis wrote in her review for The Times. Though she added that the film does have "the occasional spicy performance," as when Jon Hamm shows up playing Denis McDonough, Barack Obama's chief of staff, and the scenes in which Ted Levine portrays the former C.I.A. Director John Brennan.
What's on TV
THE TWILIGHT SAGA: BREAKING DAWN -- PART 1 (2011) 7:30 p.m. on E! The entire "Twilight" series is set to air on E! beginning at 11 a.m. Friday, giving those still digesting Thanksgiving dinner (and lucky enough to have a day off) a chance to see Bella (Kristen Stewart) end up with Edward (Robert Pattinson) all over again. "It's not a particularly pleasurable thing, how much they're attracted to each other," Pattinson reflected in a recent interview on the NPR show "Fresh Air." "It's just -- it's almost traumatic, which is kind of probably how I felt about all my teenage relationships."

By avoiding typical showboating, this issue film doesn't sink

Texto completo: There are a few notable disappearing acts being performed in 'Dark Waters,' a fact-based " and decidedly unflashy " drama about the corporate lawyer who sued DuPont for, in essence, poisoning a West Virginia community with a chemical used to make Teflon. The most obvious one is undertaken by the film's producer and star, Mark Ruffalo, who, as real-life Cincinnati attorney Rob Bilott, erases his movie-star persona beneath an unflattering haircut, cheap suit, bad posture and the ever-present pout (and jutting lower lip) of an avenging nebbish.
The second is by Bill Camp as Wilbur Tennant, the Parkersburg cattle farmer who first noticed that his cows were dying off in high numbers, and who sought the assistance of Bilott because Tennant knew the lawyer's mother. We're used to seeing Camp, one of the great unsung character actors, vanish inside a role, and here he does it again, delivering his lines with a gruff affect and thick accent that is unintelligible much of the time. (It's not a flaw of the performance. This detail is wholly accurate, according to the New York Times article that inspired the film.)
But perhaps the most superficially startling disappearing act is the one performed by the film's director, Todd Haynes, who brings a sort of aggressive stylelessness to a subject that initially seems a surprising choice for the director of the lavishly cinematic period pieces 'Carol' and 'Far From Heaven.' (It is arguably not that much of a departure for a shapeshifting filmmaker whose varied résumé also includes a film in which six actors play versions of Bob Dylan; the glam-rock musical 'Velvet Goldmine;' and his 43-minute breakout film 'Superstar' " the story of singer Karen Carpenter, told entirely with Barbie and Ken dolls. And let's not forget 'Safe,' in which Julianne Moore played a woman with multiple chemical sensitivities.)

But 'Dark Waters' feels like the kind of issue film that almost anyone could have made. The issue, in this case, being not just about DuPont " a company that, as evidence in the film shows, was aware of the dangers of its Teflon ingredients for many years before Bilott's fight " but the fight for stronger environmental protections against corporate malfeasance. The film's production company, Participant Media, has launched a campaign " in conjunction with Ruffalo, wearing his activist hat " called 'Fight Forever Chemicals.' (The term refers to often toxic man-made substances that do not break down in the environment and build up in humans and animals over time.)
As such, 'Dark Waters' is an effective outrage machine: If you like 'Erin Brockovich,' you'll probably like this too, although Ruffalo's schlubby crusader, despite the clunker he drives and his degree from what we're told is a 'no-name' law school, doesn't have quite the same working-class pizazz that Julia Roberts brought to that 2000 role. Anne Hathaway, playing Bilott's wife, is one performer who never quite disappears into her character, always seeming like the glamorous Hollywood actress in search of an Oscar moment, in what amounts to a thankless supporting role.
Still, 'Dark Waters' is a solidly built film " because of its lack of features rather than despite it. There are other good performances, including Tim Robbins's turn as Bilott's conflicted boss, the head of the corporate law firm who let his employee bite the hand that feeds them. But Victor Garber doesn't bring much nuance to the role of an obstructionist DuPont attorney, and Bill Pullman, who shows up late in the game as a country lawyer who helps Bilott drive home the knife in the case against the chemical giant, seems to have based his performance on every cinematic legal shark hiding behind an aw-shucks grin who has come before him.
'Dark Waters' doesn't aspire to be something it's not. Like Bilott himself, it gets the job done, not by showboating, but by laying out the facts.

Texto completo: President Donald Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, negotiated earlier this year to represent Ukraine's top prosecutor for at least $200,000 during the same months that Giuliani was working with the prosecutor to dig up dirt on former Vice President Joe Biden, according to people familiar with the discussions.
The people said that Giuliani began negotiations with Ukraine's top prosecutor, Yuri Lutsenko, about a possible agreement in February. In the agreement, Giuliani's company would receive payment to represent Lutsenko as the Ukrainian sought to recover assets he believed had been stolen from the government in Kyiv, those familiar with the discussions said.
The talks occurred as Giuliani met with Lutsenko in New York in January and then in Warsaw in February while he was also gathering information from Lutsenko on two topics Giuliani believed could prove useful to Trump: the involvement of Biden, and his son, Hunter, in Ukraine and allegations that Ukraine, not Russia, had interfered in the 2016 election.
Trump ultimately pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to open investigations into the two issues during a July 25 phone call between the two leaders, a call that sparked a whistleblower complaint and the congressional impeachment inquiry.
A person familiar with the negotiations described a series of contracts that were drafted earlier this year in which Giuliani would have worked for Lutsenko or separately, the Ukrainian Ministry of Justice.
For Lutsenko, the agreement would have provided a pipeline to Trump's lawyer and, through him, potentially to other top U.S. officials. For Giuliani, the agreements would have been a way to accrue financial benefit from a person who was also providing him politically damaging information that could help another client, the president of the United States.
Trump directed U.S. diplomats to work with Giuliani on Ukraine issues.
The agreements were never executed and there is no indication that Giuliani was ultimately paid by Lutsenko or other Ukrainian officials. But the negotiations proceeded far enough that a series of legal agreements were drafted under which Giuliani's company would have received more than $200,000 to work for the Ukrainians, people familiar with the agreements said.
Some versions of the agreement envisioned Washington husband-and-wife lawyers Victoria Toensing and Joe diGenova also playing a role and receiving payment.
A February draft retainer agreement with Lutsenko called for the trio to help recover money allegedly stolen from Ukraine. The draft called for Lutsenko to retain Giuliani Partners, as well as diGenova and Toensing, and pay a $200,000 retainer to Giuliani Partners.
The person said that another retainer agreement, drafted in March, called for Giuliani Partners to receive $300,000 from the Ukrainian Ministry of Justice for help locating the supposedly stolen assets. That draft agreement also stated that Toensing and diGenova would be working on the matter. That agreement called for payments to be made to Giuliani Partners.
Yet another proposal called for the Ukrainian Justice Ministry to hire Toensing and diGenova for asset recovery, but did not mention Giuliani.
An attorney for Giuliani declined to comment on the negotiations. Lutsenko, who served as Ukraine's top prosecutor until August, could not be immediately reached for comment. But in an interview with the publication Ukrainian Truth earlier this month, Lutsenko described how he was eager for Giuliani to help him get a meeting with the U.S. attorney general to discuss evidence he had uncovered that Ukrainian assets had been routed through U.S. bank accounts.
Speaking in Ukrainian, Lutsenko said that Giuliani at first agreed he could help make the connection but that he never did.
"For me, this is an absolute mystery. A few months later, a new United States Attorney General was selected. I called back several times with assistants or advisers to Giuliani with the question: 'Will there be or will not be a meeting?' " Lutsenko said.
He said Giuliani told him he would have to hire a lobbyist to get the meeting. "They even offered me such a company," Lutsenko said. "I said that I am the prosecutor general of Ukraine and will not pay a dime."
He said he was told it would be "impossible" for him to get the meeting without paying and he continued to refuse. "'I will not pay money for any meeting,'" he said.
In a statement, a spokesman for Toensing and diGenova said the couple had previously said they had agreed to represent people they described as "Ukrainian whistleblowers." Spokesman Mark Corallo confirmed those discussions included possible representation of Lutsenko.
"All the other names are attorney-client privileged and it is unfortunate that some unethical person chose to violate that privilege," he said. Corallo said that all of the retainer letters under consideration included "the necessary notice of FARA registration," referring to the Foreign Agents Registration Act. That suggests the couple had planned to register as foreign lobbyists if the agreements had been executed.
However, Corallo said that no representation was ever finalized because a trip that Toensing planned to Kyiv in May was canceled after The New York Times reported that she was accompanying Giuliani, who had hoped to meet with Ukrainian officials to press them to open an investigation into Biden and his son.
"No money was ever received and no legal work was ever performed because the trip was canceled," Corallo said.
Federal prosecutors in New York have been investigating Giuliani and two associates he tapped to help him conduct investigations in Ukraine for a wide range of possible crimes, including wire fraud.
The two associates, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, were charged earlier this year in a campaign finance case.

Texto completo: William Ruckelshaus, an official who defied President Nixon in a pivotal moment in the Watergate investigation drama, has died. He was 87.
His death at home in Seattle Wednesday was confirmed by his daughter, Mary Ruckelshaus, who did not give a cause.
Ruckelshaus quit as deputy attorney general in the so-called Saturday Night Massacre of 1973 after he refused to obey an order to fire the special prosecutor who was probing Nixon.
"I thought what the president was doing was fundamentally wrong," he told The New York Times years later.
A Republican lawyer from Indiana, Ruckelshaus joined the Nixon administration as the founding head of the Environmental Protection Agency. He won the moniker "Mr. Clean" for his environmental expertise and reputation for high ethical standards.
He was later appointed deputy attorney general and held the post during the Watergate investigation, in which Nixon and White House aides were probed after a break-in of the Democratic National Committee's headquarters at the Watergate office building in Washington during the 1972 presidential election.
Special prosecutor Archibald Cox was supposed to be completely independent, but Nixon decided to fire him in October 1973 as the scandal mushroomed.
Ruckelshaus quit after Attorney General Elliot Richardson also resigned to avoid carrying out the president's order, which a judge later ruled was illegal.
A second special prosecutor resumed the probe and Nixon eventually resigned months later in the face of near-certain impeachment and removal from office.
Ruckelshaus, who went on to become a successful industry executive, spoke out last year about parallels to Watergate as President Trump faced damaging allegations in the Russia collusion scandal.
"It's hard to believe that, 45 years later, we may be in store for another damaging attack on the foundations of our democracy," Ruckelshaus wrote in a Washington Post opinion piece. "Yet the cynical conduct of this president, his lawyers and a handful of congressional Republicans is frightening to me and should be to every citizen of this country."

Are we like Virginia or West Virginia?

Texto completo: Are we, politically speaking, more like Virginia, or more like its sister state, West Virginia?
As William Galston pointed out in the November 12 issue of the Wall Street Journal, it might depend on what time period we are talking about.
Both Virginia and West Virginia have transformed themselves politically in recent years, but have gone in opposite directions.
In the 1988 presidential election in Virginia, Republican George H.W. Bush beat Democrat Michael Dukakis 60 percent to 39 percent. In the same year in West Virginia, Dukakis beat Bush, 52 percent to 47 percent.
Skip ahead to the 2016 presidential elections. In Virginia Hillary Clinton beat Donald Trump 50 percent to 44 percent. In West Virginia, Trump prevailed 69 percent to 26 percent.
In both states, a complete turnaround. Galston writes, "It is a tale of two Virginias—and a microcosm of America's shifting political landscape."
Earlier this month, Virginia solidified its move from a Republican red state into one that is solid blue. Democrats won control of both houses of the Virginia legislature, joining a Democratic governor, lieutenant governor, attorney general and two U.S. senators.
Meanwhile West Virginia moved in the opposite direction, from solid Democratic to true red Republican dominance, excepting only the special case of Democratic U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin. Will this division hold in the 2020 elections?
Galston says that two overlapping trends, immigration and suburbanization, drove the Virginia transformation. "Many middle-class immigrants have settled in the suburbs, fueling Democratic gains, especially in Northern Virginia and the Richmond area."
However, they are not automatic Democratic voters. They are moderates and still "would have been open to the kind of candidates Republicans once fielded."
Meanwhile, in West Virginia the Republicans' appeal to working-class white voters bodes well for Trump in the 2020 contest. But, writes Galston, there is a price to pay in Virginia. "Republicans are learning that the populist takeover of their party, which began with the tea-party revolt and culminated in Mr. Trump's nomination, is a double-edged sword. As the GOP's appeal to working-class white voters intensifies, middle-class voters--native-born as well as immigrant--are backing away."
Again, what does this mean for North Carolina? Are we like Virginia or West Virginia? Arguably, our rural and small town areas compare to West Virginia, where Trump will be strong. Our large cities and their suburbs are more like Virginia where Trump's opponent will have an advantage. But that advantage does not automatically assure a Trump defeat in Virginia or North Carolina. As Roger Cohen points out in the November 15 issue of The New York Times, Democrats cannot win in places like North Carolina and Virginia without the help of former Republican voters who have soured on Trump, and are not frightened away by a too-liberal Democratic nominee.
He cites the example of former Republican officeholder and 78-year-old retired corporate executive Chuck Hardwick, who voted for Trump and still admires some of his qualities. But Hardwick told Cohen," If I was on a board that had hired Trump as C.E.O., I'd have to say to him: 'You've got good traits but you can't manage people. You're fired.'"
In the Virginia and North Carolina suburbs, Democrats cannot win the presidential contest without help from voters like Hardwick. A recent poll of Democrats, conducted by The New York Times and Siena College in North Carolina and five other states where Trump won in 2016, reported that a "majority of those surveyed said they wanted a Democratic nominee who is more moderate than most Democrats."
Therefore, the most critical election for those in North Carolina and Virginia who want to oust President Trump will come in the spring primaries when the Democratic nominee is selected.

GIULIANI SAYS HE NIXED DEALS IN UKRAINE OFFERS CAME AS HE WORKED FOR TRUMP

Texto completo: As Rudy Giuliani waged a public campaign this year to unearth damaging information in Ukraine about President Donald Trump's political rivals, he privately pursued business from Ukrainian government officials, documents show.
Mr. Giuliani, the president's personal lawyer, has repeatedly said he has no business in Ukraine, and none of the deals was finalized. But the documents are seen as indicating that while he was pushing Mr. Trump's agenda with Ukrainian officials eager for support from the United States, Mr. Giuliani also explored financial agreements with members of the same government.
Mr. Giuliani's discussions with Ukrainian officials, including the country's top prosecutor, who assisted him on the dirt-digging mission, proceeded far enough along that he signed at least one retainer agreement, on his company letterhead.
In an interview Wednesday, Mr. Giuliani played down the discussions. He said a Ukrainian official approached him this year seeking to hire him personally. Mr. Giuliani said he dismissed that suggestion, but spent about a month considering a separate deal with the Ukrainian government. He then rejected that idea.
"I thought that would be too complicated," Mr. Giuliani said. "I never received a penny."
Mr. Giuliani's shadow diplomacy campaign in Ukraine on behalf of the president is a central focus of the current House impeachment inquiry. Mr. Trump's effort to force Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to open investigations that could be damaging to his political rivals including former Vice President Joe Biden is the subject of that probe.
Witnesses in the House investigation have testified that Mr. Giuliani directed a shadow U.S. foreign policy in Ukraine aimed at securing the investigations Mr. Trump desired.
In an interview Tuesday, the former Fox News host Bill O'Reilly asked Mr. Trump if he had directed Mr. Giuliani in his Ukraine efforts. "No, I didn't direct him, but he is a warrior, he is a warrior," Mr. Trump said.
At the same time as the impeachment inquiry, a federal criminal investigation into Mr. Giuliani is examining his role in the campaign to oust Marie Yovanovitch, the American ambassador to Ukraine, and scrutinizing any financial dealings he may have had with Ukrainian officials, according to people briefed on the matter.
Prosecutors and FBI agents in Manhattan are scrutinizing whether Mr. Giuliani was not just working for the president, but also doing the bidding of Ukrainian officials who wanted the ambassador removed for their own reasons, the people said.
It is a federal crime to try to influence the United States government at the request or direction of a foreign government, politician or party without registering as a foreign agent. Mr. Giuliani did not register as one, he has said, because he was conducting an investigation "concerning 2016 Ukrainian collusion and corruption" on behalf of his client, Mr. Trump, not Ukrainians.
The federal inquiry focused on Mr. Giuliani grew out of the case against two of his associates, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, who were arrested on campaign finance charges last month. Alongside Mr. Giuliani, Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman worked to pressure Ukraine into announcing investigations into Mr. Biden and his son Hunter.
Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman have pleaded not guilty.
Spokesmen for the United States attorney in the Southern District of New York, Geoffrey Berman, whose prosecutors are handling the case, and the FBI declined to comment.
The documents reviewed by The New York Times portray an evolving effort over the course of several months by Mr. Giuliani and lawyers close to him to consider taking on various Ukrainian officials or their agencies as clients.
The Times could not determine whether the documents it reviewed comprised the entirety of discussions between Mr. Giuliani and other lawyers about representing Ukrainian government officials.
The documents date to mid-February, when one draft proposal said Mr. Giuliani would represent Yuriy Lutsenko, who was then Ukraine's top prosecutor. At the time, Mr. Giuliani had been working with Mr. Lutsenko to encourage investigations into the Bidens and the 2016 election.
The draft proposal, which was unsigned and not on letterhead, called for Mr. Lutsenko to pay $200,000 to retain Giuliani Partners, Mr. Giuliani's firm, and a husband-and-wife legal team aligned with Mr. Trump, Joseph diGenova and Victoria Toensing.
In return, Mr. Giuliani would help the government recover money it believed had been stolen and stashed overseas, advising Mr. Lutsenko "on Ukrainian claims for the recovery of sums of money in various financial institutions outside Ukraine."
The proposal came a few weeks after Mr. Giuliani met at his office in New York with Mr. Lutsenko to discuss Ukrainian corruption.
Ultimately, Ms. Yovanovitch was removed from her post in May, and Mr. Lutsenko was replaced in August after a new Ukrainian president took office.

Texto completo: Here is a provocation that might just be true: The most important moment in the impeachment battle thus far did not take place in the halls of the Capitol or even in the bars and cafes of the republic of Ukraine, but in Ankara on Oct. 17, when President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey met with Mike Pence and agreed to a cease-fire in northern Syria, thus limiting the scope of the moral and strategic debacle created by Donald Trump’s betrayal of the Kurds.
I’m not suggesting that the American public, in all its wisdom, cares more about the doughty Kurds or the lines of political control in Syria than it does about abuses of presidential power. But I am suggesting that part of the country relies on general heuristics rather than the specific details of presidential misconduct to determine when it might support something like impeachment. In which case any strategy congressional Democrats pursue or any defense served up by Jim Jordan or Lindsey Graham matters less to Trump’s fate than the answers to two basic questions: Is the economy OK? Is the world falling apart?
This supposition is based on an admittedly thin historical record. We have exactly two impeachment case studies in the modern era, Bill Clinton and Richard Nixon, which involved very different fact patterns and unspooled in very different ways.
The differences are grist for competing partisan interpretations: Liberals can argue that Clinton survived the process and Nixon didn’t because Clinton’s crimes were minor things and Nixon’s met the “high crimes” bar, while conservatives can argue that Clinton survived and Nixon didn’t because Republicans were more honorable in 1974 and Democrats more partisan in 1998.
But the simplest explanation is that Nixon didn’t survive because his second term featured a series of economic shocks — summarized on Twitter by political theorist Jacob Levy as “an oil crisis, a stock market crash, stagflation and recession” — while Clinton’s second term was the most recent peak of American power, pride and optimism. In a given impeachment debate, under this theory, neither the nature of the crimes nor the state of the political parties matter as much as whether an embattled president is seen as presiding over stability or crisis, over good times or potential ruin.
To the extent that this reductive theory is true — and clearly it’s at least somewhat true — we shouldn’t be surprised at Trump’s survival, and we shouldn’t assume that it can be explained only by polarization or hyper-partisanship, Fox News or fake news, or for that matter by the “that’s how you get Trump” progressive overreach that I tend to critique.
Of course it matters that Trump’s party is craven and debased; of course it matters that the Democrats have swung to an ideological extreme. But maybe it matters more to Trump’s not good but stable — amazingly stable — approval ratings that he is presiding over a period of general stability, at home and abroad, which would have to fall apart for the supermajority that turned on Nixon to finally turn on him.
The idea that the Trump era is stable probably seems unpersuasive to people who follow the D.C. carnival obsessively; the idea that it is more stable than the later Obama years may seem like a joke. But one reason Trump managed to get elected was that the waning years of Barack Obama’s second term felt chaotic and dangerous across multiple fronts — with the rise of the Islamic State, the Russian seizure of Crimea and the Ukrainian quasi-war, a modest increase in crime and a series of terrorist attacks domestically, and a version of the child migrant crisis that has recurred under Trump.
And if you don’t pay attention to the chaos in the nation’s capital, as quite a few Americans do not, the Trump era has been arguably calmer than 2014-16. The migrant crisis and white-nationalist terrorism have both worsened, but the late-Obama-era crime increase appears to have subsided, campuses and cities have been relatively calm, Russia’s aggression has given way to stalemate, the Islamic State’s defeat has been mostly completed and Islamist terrorism has grown more sporadic than in the period that gave us Charlie Hebdo, San Bernardino and much more. Meanwhile the economy has grown steadily, leaving a majority of Americans in their best financial position since the days when Clinton survived impeachment.
This environment has created constituencies that get less attention than the “with the president even if he shoots someone on Fifth Avenue” sort of Trump voter, but probably matter more to how impeachment plays out. These are voters who dislike Trump but give him some grudging credit for the solid economy and the absence of new foreign wars, voters who don’t support his policies but don’t share the educated-liberal revulsion at his style, and voters whose reluctant support is contingent on Trumpian chaos seeming confined to Washington.
It’s possible to persuade these lukewarm voters to turn on him; you can see it begin to happen in the polling data when his party pursues unpopular policies (the Obamacare repeal push) or when his personal chaos seems to produce a real political breakdown (the government shutdown) or when his bigotry seems linked to some real-world horror (as with Charlottesville). But when a feeling of stability returns, when there isn’t a cascade toward economic debacle, foreign-policy catastrophe or late-1960s civil strife, these voters drift back toward mixed feelings, lukewarm support, dislike leavened by skepticism about removing Trump via impeachment rather than the 2020 vote.
Which is why, to return to the initial hypothesis, it mattered that the impeachment debate began at the same time that Trump was stumbling badly on foreign policy with Turkey and the Kurds; it gave some of these voters (and the swing-state Republican senators who represent them) a feeling that maybe this time everything was going to fall apart at once, that Trump’s incompetence would blow up the Middle East at the same time that his scandals multiplied.
Then the pattern in polling since — the dip in his approval rating giving way to a tiny upswing, support for impeachment peaking and then declining just a bit — might not reflect some dramatic failure by Democrats to make the case or some dramatic success for the Trumpian defense. Instead, it might just reflect the fact that the situation in Syria seems to have temporarily stabilized, the economy is fine and there are voters who will support removing a president when the world seems to be falling apart, but if it’s not, then not.
This reality doesn’t make a case against impeaching Trump when his conduct is basically asking for it; an impeachment process can be morally correct even if it’s unlikely to succeed. Nor does it prove that impeachment will hurt the Democrats in 2020; it might be that keeping a focus on Trump’s misdeeds and corruptions is a better use of Democratic energy than fighting over which not-necessarily-popular progressive agenda item their presidential nominee should be pressured to support.
Rather, it just makes a case for a certain modesty in all analysis, whether it’s a critique of some Adam Schiff stratagem today or a condemnation of Susan Collins (or, perhaps, Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema) for not voting to remove the president tomorrow. It might just be the case that in our system it takes a clear cascade of disasters to preemptively remove a president, even a manifestly corrupt one. And though the likelihood of such a disaster the longer Trump remains in office is one reason to wish for his removal, even his fiercest critics should prefer stability, and the necessity of defeating him at the ballot box, to the Something Worse that might expedite his fall.

Texto completo: Police have charged three of the four men involved in a bloody stabbing brawl in Midtown that spread over five blocks, officials said Tuesday.
The Monday night melee broke out at W. 36th St. and Eighth Ave. about 9 p.m. and ended 15 minutes later on W. 41st St., cops said.
Troy Britt, 39, Reginald Law, 34, and Brannovan Martinez, 20, were arguing with a 27-year-old man when the beef turned bloody - and the 27-year-old stabbed Martinez in the stomach, cops said.
The assailant ran off, but was cornered by the three enraged men outside Schnippers, a restaurant on the first floor of the New York Times building on W. 41st St.
There, the trio - armed with a knife and tire iron - turned on the assailant, authorities charge.
"They chased him across the street and cornered him in front of the New York Times lobby," witness Frank Martin, 49, told the Daily News on Monday night. "They said, 'You wanna try stabbing? You're not going anywhere.' "
"That's when the tire iron came out and the stabbing started," Martin said. "It was hard to tell who was doing what to who."
When cops were called to E. 41st St., they found Britt with a stab wound to the shoulder, Law with a slashed hand and the unidentified rival with stab wounds to the buttocks and hand.
All three were taken to Bellevue Hospital with minor injuries.
Martinez ran off and was found on Sixth Ave. and W. 46th St., still bleeding from his stab wound. He, too, was taken to Bellevue Hospital, cops said.
After a brief investigation, cops charged Britt and Law with assault and gang assault, cops said. Martinez was also charged with gang assault.
No charges have been filed against the 27-year-old while detectives try to determine if he was defending himself against Martinez, authorities said.

Texto completo: For the Monitor
Sometimes I feel like an entry in the two-volume psychology tome Encyclopedia of Death and the Human Experience. I don't usually feel that way, even after 1½ years in the brown water navy in Vietnam, nine years counseling veterans with PTSD in the VA, and now an additional 20 years in private practice with a heavy share of trauma patients dealing with life-defying experiences.
But I felt that way recently, attending a free lunch celebrating Veterans Day at a banquet hall in a nearby city. The veterans, a smattering from each of our generous smorgasbord of recent wars, were humble and grateful, breaking bread together, enjoying this brief reunion of brotherhood and sisterhood.
However, at least to me, the scene was more than just sitting around the fire singing Kumbaya: I was racked by the dissonance between enjoying the understated modesty of my fellow veterans who knew war, while, at the same time, being assaulted by ultra-patriotic music, playing so loud conversation was difficult, songs so adoring and one-sided as to border on being jingoistic.
These lyrics pulled me back in time, twisting my soul, making me feel ill.
I grew up revering John Wayne and this type of – how can I nicely say it – patriotic excess.
But those fantasies of the U.S.A., which never did anything wrong, were trampled after marching off to war in Vietnam to kill innocent Third World peasants, whose leader, Ho Chi Minh, declared his independence by reciting America's 1776 Declaration of Independence.
How could I feel proud of my country for attacking Iraq because it allegedly had weapons of mass destruction, a propaganda ploy to sanction the attack that killed hundreds of thousands and upset the balance in the Middle East?
How could I be proud of our country today for supporting Saudi Arabia's massacre of Yemeni citizens and the dismembering of Jamal Khashoggi, a Washington Post columnist?
If that wasn't enough, the next day, I happened across an article in the New York Times Magazine written by an American soldier who was a medic in Afghanistan. He tells a story of survival guilt; a familiar one I have heard from hundreds of patients over the years.
What was new – and viscerally unsettling – was that he struck a nerve in me, exposing feelings I am usually in deep denial about: “You feel the guilt but it doesn't feel outsize; it doesn't seem misplaced and unjustified. Your own innocence is precisely the thing you can't see or feel.”
Though it's not that simple. In truth, my guilt extends far beyond war. I feel the same way about a lot of things, recovering, as I am, from being a white, middle-class, American man.
It isn't easy; it's a heavy burden to carry, trying to ferret out and purge my 74-year-old history as a man, steeped in patriarchy, classism and the blinders of institutional racism.
Don't get me started on what we've done to black people and Native Americans, or my own sad history of patriarchy.
I'm trying. I'm learning. I'm changing with the help of courageous mentors. However, there's one thing I am proud of: I am still proud to be an American, just one who, having taking off his rose-colored glasses, no longer grants her blind obedience, parroting that everything she does is right and virtuous.
Consequently, while I love her just as much, it's more in the manner of a parent loving his delinquent teenager. Because I love her, it is my duty to work to change her objectionable behavior – and right now, there's a lot to change.

David Holmes: From Claremont Colleges to impeachment hearings

Texto completo: There’s a local angle to everything, even the impeachment hearings. David Holmes, a U.S. Embassy diplomat in Ukraine who testified Nov. 21, went to college in the Inland Valley, as reader Ray Escoto alerted me.
“I’m a graduate of Pomona College in Claremont, California,” Holmes told the House Intelligence Committee in his opening statement. No one interrupted to ask why Pomona College isn’t in Pomona.
Holmes is the witness who said he was eating lunch at a restaurant in Ukraine with Gordon Sondland, the ambassador, when Sondland placed a call to President Donald Trump on an unsecured line. Trump spoke so loudly, Holmes said, that Sondland pulled the phone away from his ear and both sides of the conversation were audible.
(We’ve all taken calls like that. Perhaps I’ll get one after this item runs.)
According to Holmes, when Trump asked if the Ukrainian president was on board with investigating the Bidens, Sondland assured the president, “He loves your ass.”
“There’s just so much about the call that was so remarkable that I remember it vividly,” Holmes testified.
In response, Trump tweeted that his hearing is “great” and that he’s never been able to overhear the other side of a phone conversation, statements that may cancel each other out.
“Who is David Holmes?,” the New York Times asked in a headline the next day. Answering its own question, the paper said Holmes joined the State Department under President George W. Bush and has been stationed in Russia, Afghanistan and India.
He won a State Department award in 2014 for “constructive dissent” for expressing concerns about President Barack Obama’s policy toward Afghanistan. The Washington Post described him as “a rising star in the Foreign Service.”
Closer to home, the 1997 alumnus won Pomona College’s Inspirational Young Alumni Award in 2004. Still, be careful what you say around him. He must have good ears.
Grandfatherly advice
A newspaper colleague in Upland told me last week: “My grandson had to attend a council meeting for his government class so I suggested he go to Ontario, rather than Upland meetings which go on forever. Great idea — tonight’s Ontario meeting lasted 12 minutes.”
I’ve rarely seen any high school students at Ontario meetings, but they’re worth the drive if you want to spare yourself a late night. And also if your grade isn’t dependent on excitement.
Stone wall (cont’d)
Remember the topic of the stone wall on Claremont’s Foothill Boulevard, newly revealed after vegetation was removed? Its origins are somewhat mysterious, although it’s believed to date to the 1920s or ’30s, when the land behind it was first subdivided for housing.
But now we know who built it: Clarence Stover.
Paula Pitzer, into whose family Stover married, told me: “His idea was he would make a form and drop in cement, rebar and these rocks. After he got in enough layers, he would shake the form. The idea is the rocks would slide over the surfaces and it would make it a good look.”
Stover’s company built houses, college buildings and commercial buildings in the Village. Stover “contributed to the look of Claremont more than any other builder,” John Neiuber wrote in the Courier in 2018.
Stover graduated from Pomona College in 1921, later served as a trustee and has the campus’ Stover Memorial Walk near Bridges Auditorium named for him. He died in 1955.
“He never did another wall,” Pitzer said. Apparently building it was more labor-intensive than he’d expected. But the one wall he did certainly contributed to the look of Claremont.
Thanksgiving!
Thanksgiving almost couldn’t fall any later, but here it comes Nov. 28 — not even a month shy of Christmas.
Whenever the date lands, it’s an opportunity to reflect on what we’re thankful for. Reasons I’m thankful include a stimulating job in an ever-changing valley, one that generates a steady flow of column ideas. Another reason is you attentive readers, who let me know you’re reading, correct me when I flub something and give me the occasional knock to keep me honest.
Thanks for reading, enjoy your holiday and I’ll see you here Friday — with a column I’ll be cobbling together on Wednesday, pre-turkey.
Valley Vignette
The TGI Friday’s restaurant in Ontario at 3351 N. Centre Lake Drive is closing Dec. 8. Reader Jeff Butler told me he and his wife have been regulars for 15 years and got the bad news from the manager recently. “There are a lot of memories from that place, as we had many birthday dinners and dinners with good friends there,” Butler said. The restaurant is planning a “Go out with a bang” farewell party Dec. 5 from 6 to 10 p.m. for regulars. “So come early,” an announcement board in the restaurant urges, “and let’s talk about how we all made this place like home.”

Texto completo: The pledge of ranking Republican member of the House Intelligence Committee Devin Nunes to sue CNN and the Daily Beast is just the last such threat coming from the White House and its allies. President Donald Trump has publicly called for changing the libel laws, a repeated demand that ignores that the defamation standard rests on constitutional not statutory authority. While such threats may be cathartic and popular, Nunes may be doing greater damage to the White House than the media in declaring his intent to sue.
Nunes is aggrieved by the coverage of a breaking story that he used a congressional trip to meet with Ukrainian officials to dig up dirt against the Bidens in 2018. CNN and the Daily Beast cite Lev Parnas' lawyer as the source. Parnas, a former Rudy Guliani associate, was indicted in October for conspiring to violate the ban on foreign donations.
Nunes vehemently denied the stories and declared that “we actually caught them” in advancing a false story and a defamation lawsuit will soon follow.
The president's repeated denunciations of the press
At the outset, it is worth noting that I agree with the White House that there is a great deal of distorted and biased coverage of this president. However, that does not justify the president’s reckless attacks on the media as “the enemy of the people” or his desire to roll back protections for the free press. More importantly, in this matter, Nunes proceeded to make statements that could easily be viewed as attacking the defenses raised not only by the White House but Nunes himself.
“This is criminal in nature. ” Nunes states, “The problem with this week’s fake news story is — we actually caught them. And we caught them badly and it also involves criminal activity. . . We are going to take both CNN and the Daily Beast likely into federal court, right after Thanksgiving and we hope they cooperate. ”
One possible meaning is that Nunes is referencing one of the “per se” categories for defamation in asserting that someone is committing a criminal offense. That would be a reference to a member of Congress using a public funds for political purposes. Yet, that is very similar to what Democrats are accusing President Trump of doing in pushing a quid pro quo by withholding aid or other official acts. One defense (raised by acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney) is that such quid pro quos have always been part of foreign policy so, “I have news for everybody: Get over it. ” If the criminal matter is the intermixing of politics with public-funded work, Nunes could find himself in the unenviable position of rivaling Mulvaney as one of the most quoted Republicans in this scandal.
Nunes stated "It is not OK to work with someone who has been indicted on [a] serious federal crime, to build a media narrative and dirty up a member of Congress. ”
Why is he suing me: Free speech means I don't have to be nice to Devin Nunes on Twitter.
One can certainly understand the desire to avoid association with Parnas or his equally dubious associate Igor Fruman. Parnas and Fruman bear striking resemblance to Flotsam and Jetsam — the craven and ingratiating henchmen for the sea witch Ursula in The Little Mermaid. Both men were arrested trying to leave the country at the airport shortly after meeting with Giuliani (who makes Ursula look like a public minded citizen).
The problem is that these two alleged felons, to use Ursula’s description, were Giuliani’s “poor little poopsies” in Ukraine. They worked with Giuliani who was (according to Giuliani and various witnesses) working for President Trump in pursuing matters in Ukraine. If it was untoward to be working with them, Nunes could have a problem in explaining why Giuliani maintained his own association with them in Ukraine.
Nunes has set an odd standard
Moreover, it is bizarre to suggest that the media should not work with accused felons. Many major stories are based on accounts from not just indicted but convicted felons. That is particularly the case when you are covering possible unethical or criminal acts. The association with such individuals is a problem for people like Giuliani, not the media.
This is why the premise of this defamation lawsuit is so potentially damaging to the narrative supporting the president. You cannot allege that it is per se defamatory to associate you with two individuals who have only two degrees of separation from the president himself. Indeed, the president has associated directly with a number of proven felons including his former personal counsel Michael Cohen and his former campaign chair Paul Manafort. They both displayed the same ravenous corrupt appetites in mixing government and private interests.
He's been a liability: Rudy Giuliani's flubs may let Stormy Daniels take down President Trump
Nunes has insisted that he will file the lawsuits against CNN and the Daily Beast after Thanksgiving and added “we hope they cooperate. " They may be more cooperative than he expects. With such a lawsuit will come depositions and discovery into Nunes’ travel, associations and efforts. That could prove a treasure trove for two organizations with diminishing access to Republican sources. Moreover, Nunes will have to satisfy the standard that Trump has repeatedly denounced: the New York Times Company v. Sullivan standard of “actual malice. ”
That decision imposed a higher standard of proof for lawsuits by public officials based on the First Amendment’s protection of free speech and the free press. During the civil rights movement, various southern states were using their defamation laws to hit media companies with huge damage awards to coerce them into silence. The court mandated that officials like Nunes must show that the media was acting with either knowledge of the falsity of their reporting or reckless disregard for the truth.
That standard is designed to be difficult to prove and meant to give protection to the media in publishing allegations against high-ranking officials. What may be easier to prove is that these two individuals are not the types with whom any responsible and reputable official would associate. The problem is that a couple of notable figures did precisely that.

Texto completo: An advocacy group says it has documented systematic sexual abuse by teachers, principals and other authorities of dozens of boys in one rural area.
KABUL, Afghanistan -- The 14-year-old Afghan boy said his teacher had asked him for "a little favor" in return for not failing him on his final exams. Then the man took him to the school library, locked the door and raped him, the boy said.
At the same school, a 17-year-old boy reported similar treatment from the school's principal. He said the man had threatened to kill him if he told anyone.
But the boys did talk, giving their accounts to a child advocacy group in their province and repeating them later in interviews with The New York Times. The advocacy group discovered that those two boys were not the only victims. From just three schools in one area of Logar Province, south of the Afghan capital, the group said it had taken statements from 165 boys who said they had been sexually abused at their schools, or by local officials they went to for help.
Now, Afghanistan is again caught up in discussion of rampant sexual abuse of children, and of a deep reluctance by many officials to deal with the issue at all.
After talking with the TOLO news channel about the investigation, the leader of the Logar advocacy group, Mohammad Musa, and a colleague, Ehsanullah Hamidi, were detained by Afghanistan's national intelligence agency late last week, the group says.
On Monday, former President Hamid Karzai said that if verified, the detention of Mr. Musa by the intelligence agency was "a very wrong thing."
A spokesman for the National Directorate of Security declined to comment Monday. Mr. Musa has not been reachable for comment since late Thursday.
Robert A. Destro, the assistant secretary of state, said on Twitter that the United States was closely following the case and was "greatly concerned." He called on the Afghan government "to take action to protect survivors and bring perpetrators to justice."
It is unclear whether the cases at the three schools are related. But the prevalence of systematic sexual abuse of boys in Afghanistan has been a problem for generations. Bacha bazi -- it means boy play -- is common among men in powerful positions who keep boys as sex slaves. Bacha bazi boys are forced to dress as girls and to dance for men before being raped. Sometimes the boys are prostituted to the highest bidder.
In an interview with The New York Times this month, Mr. Musa said that his group -- the Logar Youth, Social and Civil Institution -- began intensively investigating after a troubling Facebook post in May that showed men with boys in sexual positions. One video provided by the group shows a teenage boy dancing barefoot for about two dozen men who stand or sit in a circle around him.
The post came down quickly, Mr. Musa said, but the group was able to preserve many of the images. Some of the boys were recognizable, and had complained of sexual abuse before, he said.
The Logar group began methodically talking to students in the area, finding dozens who said they had been raped. Many of their accounts were confirmed by teachers or other people in the area, who along with four of the boys were also interviewed by The Times.
As the accounts unfolded, at least seven boys who said they had been raped were found dead, Mr. Musa said, most likely at the hands of their own families.
Mr. Musa said that the advocacy group took the boys' statements to Logar provincial police, but that no action was taken. He said several boys who had agreed to be questioned by the police were subsequently raped by officers.
Shapoor Ahmadzai, a spokesman for the Logar provincial police, said the accusations were false. "Nobody has come to the police for rape cases," he said. "It's just rumors."
The Logar provincial governor, Mohammad Anwar Ashaqzai, said officials were examining boys' statements provided by the advocacy group. He said he was not aware of any rapes in the province's schools.
"If we find these documents are incomplete and they are fake, then those who are involved will face the law and should be punished," Mr. Ashaqzai said.
Still, in response to the group's accusations, the Ministry of Education in Kabul said on Nov. 14 that it was sending a delegation to the province to investigate.
In Logar, Shafiullah Afghanzai, the executive officer of Hamid Karzai high school, where the 14-year-old and the 17-year-old said they had been raped, told The Times that the school's headmaster had been transferred to another district earlier this year after he was accused of sexually assaulting a boy.
Mr. Afghanzai said boys had also been raped by teachers at two other schools in the province. He said three boys who had reported rapes were later killed by the Taliban, who condemn the sexual abuse as anti-Islamic.
"If they get evidence that teachers were involved, they will hang them," Mr. Afghanzai said of the militants.
A Taliban spokesman did not respond to requests for comment.
Hassibullah Stanikzai, the head of the Logar provincial council, said the bodies of several boys had been found in areas of Logar under Taliban control. But he said there was no evidence that their deaths were related to sexual assault.
A teacher at one school in Logar, who asked to be identified only by his first name, Hamid, said he had spoken to 13 boys who said they had been raped by teachers there. He said the families of three of those boys had moved away to avoid the social stigma of rape, especially after images were posted on Facebook.
"It's a crisis," Hamid said. "We want to do something to stop this mafia, but we don't know what to do."
Mr. Musa, of the advocacy group, said 25 families abandoned their homes in shame after their sons said they had been raped. In some cases, he said, the boys' faces had been visible in images on the anonymous Facebook page before it was taken down.
In several cases, boys had been banished from home by their fathers, Mr. Musa said.
"We don't trust anyone, neither the Taliban nor the government," Mr. Musa said. One school is in an area contested by the Taliban, and two are in government-controlled areas. Wakil Kaliwal, the head of the education department in Logar, said there were perhaps one or two cases of student rape in the province's schools but no epidemic of sexual assault. He said the principal at Hamid Karzai high school had been transferred for beating a boy but also had been accused of raping another boy.
Mr. Kaliwal added, referring to sexual assaults of boys: "It is an issue across the country and Logar isn't exceptional."
Mohammad Qasim Sediqqi, a member of the Logar provincial council, said there was no evidence of widespread rape in schools. "Maybe there are one or two cases, because this is Afghanistan and crime exists everywhere," he said.
President Ashraf Ghani, who is from Logar, promised in 2015 to crack down on bacha bazi. But pederasty is still widely tolerated in Afghan culture, and prosecutions of men who sexually assault boys are rare.
An investigation by The New York Times in 2015 found widespread sexual assault of boys by the Afghan security forces or others in power, and that the American military was reluctant to intervene. The article reported that an American captain was relieved of command and a first sergeant was pressured to retire after they confronted and shoved an Afghan militia commander who had raped a boy. That article led to a report by the Special Inspector General for Afghan Reconstruction on the military's reticence to confront the abuse.
Afghanistan made bacha bazi and related offenses violations of the national criminal code in May 2017. The penalty for violating the code is up to three years in prison -- three to five years if the dancing is "a public event." If a teacher, instructor or "superior in any way is involved," the penalty is five years in prison.
But Charu Lata Hogg, executive director of All Survivors Project, a human rights group based in Liechtenstein, said the group interviewed 24 male rape victims in four Afghan provinces, not including Logar.
"We found that sexual violence against boys and young men is pervasive and happens within communities, police checkpoints and in detention settings," Ms. Hogg said.
She said her group welcomed the 2017 laws, but she added that the authorities must "apply the law and hold perpetrators to account."
In a 2018 report, the United Nations documented 78 cases of sexual assault against boys in Afghanistan, adding, "Impunity for perpetrators remains a serious challenge."
Shaharzad Akbar, chair of the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission, called on the authorities to investigate the Logar allegations and prosecute anyone involved. She asked government officials to protect members of the advocacy group and refrain from "the language of fear and intimidation."
Amnesty International warned that the two detained rights activists were at risk of torture "and other ill-treatment" as long as they remained in custody.
Lyla Lynn Schwartz, who counsels victims of trauma in Afghanistan, including rape, said Afghan boys raped by men often suffer extreme emotional and psychological distress, often for the rest of their lives. The victims are often ostracized, or even attacked, by their family members over a perceived dishonor.
The 17-year-old from Hamid Karzai high school said in an interview that he was left homeless after his father banished him. He said he no longer attends school.
"My father says if he sees me again," he said, "he will kill me."
Reporting was contributed by Farooq Jan Mangal from Khost, Afghanistan, and by a New York Times journalist from Logar Province.

Texto completo: Carbondale, Colo. — Deep inside Alaska’s six-million-acre Denali National Park and Preserve, I could see miles of space beneath my feet as I stood on the summit of the tallest mountain in North America. The startling view from the 20,310-foot Denali of rugged wilderness spreading out in all directions, plus the challenge of climbing it, were just two of the many wonders and adventures that I’ve experienced in America’s national parks.
I recently finished writing a book for National Geographic, Atlas of the National Parks, based on extensive research, a lifetime of exploring the parks and several years in the 1980s working as a ranger in two of them, Denali and Rocky Mountain in Colorado.
I meant the book as a celebration of the 103-year-old national park system, and it is. But what I also discovered was an operation in deep trouble, with some parks degraded by ruinous overcrowding; invasions of nonnative plants and animals that are upending delicate ecological balances; and a warming climate that is melting glaciers and withering away the rare yuccas that give their name to Joshua Tree National Park.
Adding to these woes, the system is badly underfunded and suffering from neglect. This is not a new problem, but it is getting worse, with deferred maintenance that mostly predates the Trump administration now topping $11 billion. But President Trump isn’t helping. He wants to cut the National Park Service’s budget by $481 million next year and is reportedly considering privatizing campgrounds and commercializing the parks in ways that contradict the agency’s goal of harmonizing with nature.
We need to arrest this decline and make the park system the national priority it should be. We need to inventory and assess the health of these magnificent parks and ask some hard questions about the capacity of celebrated retreats to withstand the millions of visitors who arrive every year. In 2016, the centennial of the Park Service’s creation, 330 million were recorded at the 419 parks, recreation areas, monuments, seashores and battlefields and other places that make up the system. The agency’s mandate of wide-open access and preservation has become a paradox that we need to sort out.
As Dan Wenk, the former superintendent of Yellowstone National Park, put it, “The least-studied mammal in Yellowstone is the most abundant: humans.” Unfortunately, a lack of leadership has prevented the Interior Department, which oversees the Park Service, from determining at what point crowds interfere with the preservation of each park.
The challenge is a tough one. Mr. Wenk told a group of businessmen in 2016 that he could foresee a peak-season cap on visitors to Yellowstone. The new superintendent has said he has no plans to limit access to the park.
Our parks were intended as havens from the stresses of the modern world and places where the nation’s natural and historic legacies would be preserved. But the world continues to close in on them. In May, the National Parks Conservation Association said that 96 percent of the parks were compromised by “significant” air pollution problems, with most having unhealthy air for portions of the year.
Yellowstone has 1,386 native plant species and 225 nonnative ones. And this is only a fraction of the more than 6,500 species of disruptive invasive species of animals and plants found proliferating on some of the 85 million acres administered by the Park Service.
Even high up on frigid Denali, I saw troubling changes. Three years ago, we skied past melt ponds on the Kahiltna Glacier at an elevation of 8,000 feet; before that, I had never seen water there in my more than 40 years of climbing the mountain. Since 2004, the glacier has consistently thinned. In Washington’s North Cascades National Park, as much as 56 percent of the ice has disappeared over the last century. Montana’s Glacier National Park is on the way to having no glaciers.
And when climbing Denali in 2016, I had to wait my turn behind dozens of other climbers to clip into fixed ropes safeguarding our passage. That had never happened on my previous Denali climbs, but traffic on the mountain and in the park has nearly doubled since I was a ranger there in the early 1980s and now over a thousand climbers attempt Denali each summer. Like the three most popular national parks in the Lower 48 — Great Smoky Mountains, Grand Canyon and Rocky Mountain — Denali National Park’s renowned mountain, at least on its easiest route, has become crowded. Fortunately, elsewhere in that enormous, remote place there is still plenty of room for visitors.
This is not true at some other parks. At Zion National Park, which has more visitors per acre than any other national park, I had to wait my turn in a long line to finish the classic hike up to Angels Landing. At Arches National Park, I watched as tourists blithely walked off trail across the desert, destroying fragile cryptobiotic soils. In Grand Canyon, I saw Ancestral Puebloan petroglyphs on sandstone walls defaced by modern graffiti artists. And in Rocky Mountain, I paddled my pack raft past thousands of acres of reddened pine-needle forest killed by the invasive pine beetle that is ravaging many Western national parks.
Last winter I visited the 1.5-million-acre Everglades National Park, and I delighted in identifying dozens of different native wading bird species, from roseate spoonbills to storks. But I also saw a nine-foot-long Burmese python wrapped around the axle of a neighboring camper’s truck. Numbering in the thousands but mostly invisible because of their camouflage-patterned skin, this invasive predator from Southeast Asia, which can grow more than 20 feet long and weigh up to 200 pounds, is slowly squeezing out some species of the park, including small deer and an occasional alligator. Bounty hunters are trying to make a dent in the population. The python is one of more than 100 animal and plant invasive species pushing out natives in the park.
I came away distressed by my visit. The park is often overrun with motorboats tearing up sea grass; it suffers from a lack of clean freshwater from the north because of human diversions, while ocean storm surges in the south contaminate the freshwater marshes with salt water. (To his credit, President Trump signaled support in May for $200 million for federal work on watershed restoration in the Everglades.)
Over the decades, this park has accumulated a huge backlog of maintenance problems that affect everyday tourism. And tourists have gotten wind of this decline: Visits dropped to less than 600,000 last year after averaging about a million annually over the previous six years. Does Everglades National Park offer a portent for other parks?
Perhaps it’s no surprise that my most instructive visit was to the Interior Department’s Washington headquarters in 2018. The spacious hallways of the five-acre, stone-quarried edifice, where the Park Service’s bison motif was omnipresent, were strangely empty. Some 1,500 employees during the Trump administration, including many scientists, had been dismissed or reprimanded. So the three longtime Park Service officials I was there to meet with about my book were clearly demoralized.
One of them spoke to my fears when she told me that they couldn’t recommend anyone there to write an environment-focused foreword for the book, even though the Park Service had collaborated on it with my publisher, National Geographic Books. Not long after my visit, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke would resign under pressure as he faced investigations into his business dealings and policy decisions. He would be replaced by David Bernhardt, a former oil and gas lobbyist.
At the president’s bidding Mr. Zinke had shrunk two national monuments in Utah, Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante, by 85 percent and about 50 percent, which will open the way for the newly unprotected land to be exploited by mining and fossil fuel companies. Despite his departure, these pro-development park policies remain unchanged.
Amid this lack of respect for our protected public lands, it will take a dedicated course change to stop the impending tragedy facing our park commons. But as a lifelong visitor and former ranger, I know it’s not too late for a rescue.
Congress must provide more money to turn around the deferred maintenance and run the park’s day-to-day operations. We need to strengthen essential environmental laws like the Clean Water and Clear Air Acts. We must preserve these places, not open them to mining, grazing and timber cutting. And we need to address the international urgency of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Otherwise, the national parks that define us as a country and are visited by hundreds of millions each year will be beyond saving.

Texto completo: Los globos gigantes del desfile del Día de Acción de Gracias de Macy’s podría ser suspendidos este año, debido a los fuertes vientos.
Expertos meteorológicos pronosticaron vientos helados sostenidos de 22 mph (unos 35 kilómetros por hora) y ráfagas de hasta de 39 mph (unos 39 kilómetros por hora) , que se concentrarían durante las horas que se realiza el desfile en Manhattan.
Según disposiciones locales, los globos no pueden ser elevados si los vientos sostenidos superan las 23 mph y las ráfagas superan los 34 mph.
Será hasta el jueves por mañana, el mismo día del desfile, cuando el gobierno de Bill de Blasio determine si es seguro elevar los globos, ya que las condiciones de los vientos proyectadas desde este lunes podrían cambiar en ese entonces.

Texto completo: To the Editor:
Re "Paying Dearly for a Defective Breath Test" (front page, Nov. 4):
Alcohol breath testing devices, when properly calibrated and maintained, are precise scientific instruments to measure the ethanol concentration in breath. Our agency has model specifications for alcohol breath-testing devices in the United States and maintains a Conforming Products List of devices that meet those specifications.
The Volpe Alcohol Countermeasures Laboratory tests every device sent by manufacturers at several blood alcohol concentration levels and at different breath sample volumes and flow intensities before the device is included on the list.
To ensure accuracy, alcohol breath testing programs must perform regular maintenance and calibration checks on their devices, and calibrate their devices when outside of specifications.
In 2018, there were 10,511 alcohol-impaired driving fatalities in the United States. Impaired driving arrests and convictions are based on many factors, and do not rely solely on a breath test. Properly calibrated and maintained alcohol breath testing instruments are an important tool for law enforcement, and our roads are much safer with the help of these devices.

'Nervous' leakers: Early peek into DOJ watchdog's FISA report emboldens Trump allies

Texto completo: The leaks came quickly after Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz announced his long-awaited report on alleged government surveillance abuses against a member of the Trump campaign would be released in a matter of weeks.
Contrary to the allegations often trumpeted by President Trump and his allies, reports from outlets such as the Washington Post and New York Times said the watchdog is expected to find political bias did not taint the Russia investigation, absolving top officials such as former FBI Director James Comey, Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, and special agent Peter Strzok on this matter.
Yes, missteps and lapses in judgment were made, but the most damning revelation pertains to an FBI lawyer, identified as Kevin Clinesmith, allegedly altering a document related to the wiretapping of onetime Trump campaign adviser Carter Page. A far cry from the "premeditated fraud" conspiracy pushed on a near-nightly basis by Fox News host Sean Hannity, Horowitz's investigators determined Clinesmith's actions did not taint the overall validity of a renewal application. Additionally, Horowitz determined the opening of the FBI's counterintelligence investigation into the Trump campaign in July 2016 was justified.
None of this amounts to what Trump's closest allies have hyped up for months: A concerted effort to monitor and undermine his 2016 campaign, particularly with how the FBI relied on an unverified dossier compiled by British ex-spy Christopher Steele to obtain the warrants to wiretap Page.
Democrats, fully engaged in an impeachment effort against Trump, have expressed little appetite to talk Horowitz's report and counter Republican allegations of an effort to overthrow the president. "It looks like the evidence is going to show otherwise. It's time for us to move on," Rep. Eric Swalwell, a Democratic member of the House Intelligence Committee, said on Fox News Sunday.
Yet the dearth of evidence speaking to the existence of a "deep state" plot, coupled with the towering impeachment case against the president, has done little to discourage Trump's staunchest defenders.
After all, Trump himself said on Friday he has heard Horowitz's report will be "historic," and former acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker speculated Friday that the president "has certainly been briefed on it by Attorney General [William] Barr at this point."
So what is going on?
Former Republican Rep. Jason Chaffetz has an idea. During a Fox News appearance on Saturday, Chaffetz accused the media of attempting to "diminish" what Trump said about the report. Other Trump allies, including Hannity, have suggested a concerted effort by subjects of the investigation to "get ahead" of the the report's publication.
Steve Bannon, who was Trump's chief campaign executive and chief strategist in the White House, said the leaks show "how nervous they are."
"When they are leaking a report two and a half or three weeks in advance and to try to get ahead of the story, 'Oh nothing to see, let’s move on, it's just some lower-level functionaries.' That is not going to wash," Bannon said on Fox News's Sunday Morning Futures.
Horowitz confirmed on Thursday that he expects his final report to be released to the public on Dec. 9 and is scheduled to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee two days later. By the end of the night, reports surfaced about Horowitz's findings, including that Horowitz made a criminal referral to U.S. Attorney John Durham about the lawyer who was later identified as Clinesmith. Durham is conducting a criminal investigation into the origins of the Russia investigation.
These initial reports cast the FBI lawyer as a low-level employee, but Clinesmith was an attorney with the FBI’s National Security and Cyber Law Branch and worked under then-FBI General Counsel James Baker and Deputy General Counsel Trisha Anderson. Clinesmith had worked on the Clinton email investigation as well as special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation. He was kicked off the latter case after Horowitz discovered he expressed negative opinions of Trump in messages to colleagues, including one that said, "Viva le resistance."
All the reports that emerged Thursday and Friday are based on sources familiar with a draft of the inspector general's report, which has prompted some caution among those asked to comment. Even former CIA Director John Brennan, a vocal Trump critic who some believe could be criticized in the report, said he would reserve judgment.
"This report, supposedly, that Horowitz is going to come forward with, if there was some type of modification, the question is when was it done, why was it done," Brennan said Friday on MSNBC, referring to the situation with Clinesmith. "And so the IG reports usually will take a very close look and use a microscope to look at these things, but I think we just have to wait for it to come out to determine exactly whether or not there was any wrongdoing whatsoever or whether or not there were just some things that happened that, you know, might not have been exactly the way they should have taken place."
One person already criticizing Horowitz is Page himself. Although he was at the epicenter of Horowitz's investigation, Page claimed on Friday that he's had "zero ability" to review the report or provide any feedback or corrections compared to those people he believes are behind the leaks.
"Unfortunately, the way that this inspector general report has been assembled and completed over the last couple of years and particularly over the last few months is completely sloppy," Page told CNN on Saturday. "It’s only one side’s perspective."
Whitaker said he expects "one of the more consequential inspector general reports we've seen in probably the last two decades." Referring to the contentious political debate hovering over Mueller's investigation and the Page-FISA controversy, Whitaker added that he hopes the watchdog report's disclosure will "begin the process of a restoration of confidence in the Department of Justice and the FBI."

Renée Taylor on 'Diet,' comedy and her late husband

Texto completo: Following the Vogue Champagne Diet, Renée Taylor downed two glasses of bubbly before each meal.
Now, not cheap champagne. Cheap champagne has more calories.
"I lost weight, but I became a $200-a-day Cristal drunk," the legendary comedian said.
Aye, there's the rub.
And there's always a rub.
"The Nanny" star, who is 86, is sharing her story of life, food and what she learned in the hilarious "My Life On A Diet," now through Dec.15 at George Street Playhouse in New Brunswick.
"I just happened to remember my life in terms of what I was eating," Taylor said. "I would say to my friends, 'oh yeah, that's when we were on the Last Chance Diet.' Whenever I met somebody famous, I'd ask them what they were eating because I thought, well if I eat like them, I'll look like them. So it never worked, but that's how I was thinking."
She was forever on a quest to lose weight in search of nailing roles.
"I thought if I looked a certain way, I'd have a certain kind of a career, so I was always losing weight for different parts."
And there were so many diets.
"I was on the amphetamine diet. There was a time where everybody was taking Dexamyls before they had a meal. And I was on the Last Chance Diet, which was a liquid protein. I got off that because people died. I read in The New York Times that you can't live on that little amount of protein a day and so people died."
Ultimately, it was the "The Nanny," the '90s sitcom starring Fran Drescher, that ended that quest. Taylor played Drescher's overbearing Jewish mother, Sylvia.
"I had a lot of success when I was on 'The Nanny' and I was overweight and I really saw it didn't matter what my weight was, people didn't care about whether I was fat or whether I was thin," she said. "But it all had to do with your image of yourself, I came to see that it was really just a way of sidetracking, distracting myself by being on a diet all the time.
In addition to pointing to "The Nanny" as a turning point in her life in regard to her relationship with food, it also was a highlight of her career, she says.
"It was so much fun. We laughed all the time. When I first did it, the costume designer, Brenda Cooper, who won an Emmy for the clothes on the show, I met her in a department store and she said, 'This is what you're gonna wear.' And I said, 'Who would wear something like that?' And she said, 'You!' That was a wonderful introduction to the character because, and I had never won a girdle before, but she said, 'Would you wear a girdle? It makes you walk a certain way, you move a certain way,' and it was true. And when your hair is so high, you move a certain way. So it was really wonderful to explore a character from the physical appearance and then find out who that person was."
She wrote of her experiences in "My Life On A Diet" as a book, and her late husband, actor, playwright and screenwriter Joe Bologna, suggested it would make a great one-woman show.
And he was right. Not only has the comedy been a success, but Taylor says people come up to her after the show and share their stories of the crazy diets they've been on.
Taylor says Bologna did draw a line for the show.
"The pregnant women's urine diet. Well, that's pretty wild. You know, you inject yourself with pregnant women's urine before you eat. Actually it works. I don't really know why, but it does. I lost a lot of weight on it. I did that diet but my husband didn't want to put it in the show. (He) thought it was too gross."
Taylor says ultimately, in addition to learning to accept herself, she learned lifestyle changes are much more important than fad diets.
"They are all pretty crazy. You know if you eat eight bananas a day, you're going to lose weight, whatever kind of restrictions you give yourself, it's going to work for a certain period of time. But then you learn that what's really important is your body feeling good. That's really what's important and it's really your lifestyle, not your diet."
Taylor says her outlook as a comic also has a major impact on her life.
"In my family, everybody was so serious that I just made jokes. I don't like to be serious for too long a period, so I always think of something funny. Everything strikes me as funny. I don't take myself seriously. I really don't. Because you know why? Because life is too serious to take it serious or to take things personally. I just let things go."
She says that sharing her story through comedy allows her to get important messages across, and also serves as a connection to Bologna.
"It's really great to share with people that way and since my husband died two years ago and he directed the show and wrote it with me, doing the show is very healing for me to re-create the humor that we had together. He comes to life every night when I do it on the stage. So that's a wonderful feeling for me."
"My Life On A Diet" is the first full production in the Arthur Laurents Theatre at the new New Brunswick Performing Arts Center.
"That was a real honor," she said.

Texto completo: Early in Wednesday's Democratic debate, Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Cory Booker, D-N.J., had an exchange that tells you almost everything you need to know about the Warren campaign, and even the broader Democratic contest. It happened when moderator Andrea Mitchell lobbed her a softball question about uniting the country, and Warren batted it away with a paean to her favorite policy: stiff wealth taxation.
"The way we achieve our goals and bring our country together," said Warren, "is we talk about the things that unite us, and that is that we want to build: an America that works for the people, not one that just works for rich folks."
Booker, who was asked whether he agreed with this strategy, somewhat regretfully demurred. He acknowledged the need for more tax revenue, of course, to fund the spending Democrats want to do. "But here's the challenge. We as Democrats need to fight for a just taxation system. But as I travel around the country, we Democrats also have to talk about how to grow wealth, as well."
And there, in a few simple words, is the choice Democrats face: between an economic moderate who thinks that growing the size of the economic pie has to be an important part of the Democratic agenda, and a full-blown progressive who just wants to carve it up differently.
This will not, of course, be news to anyone who has been paying attention. What's somewhat more interesting is their respective constituencies. Booker is overperforming among nonwhite voters, who tend to be not just lower-income but more socially conservative, and more focused on bread-and-butter issues, than white Democrats. Warren, on the other hand, is the candidate of the affluent, the educated and the white, what Republican polling firm Echelon Insights recently dubbed the "Acela Party."
It might seem a bit strange that wealth taxes are being promulgated by a candidate who caters to white professionals with healthy household balance sheets, while the former mayor of Newark is making such investment-bankerly noises. But in fact there's a certain logic to it. After all, wealth taxes -- as Booker ably pointed out -- don't really make much sense as a technocratic policy matter.
If you want to spend a bunch of money on new social programs, a value-added tax is harder to evade and raises a lot more revenue. A tax on capital income is more economically efficient and just as progressive. A broad-based and highly progressive income tax is much easier to administer. And if you think that billionaires get that way by doing something socially harmful, regulating or taxing that specific activity would be more effective at ending their malfeasance. None of these methods carry the heavy risk, inherent to a wealth tax, that America's capital base will erode, and then productivity will erode, and then worker incomes will shrink.
But there is one thing a wealth tax can do better than anything else: destroy fortunes. That money doesn't necessarily go to anyone else, mind you; it may just get eaten up by compliance costs and dead-weight losses. But the rich people definitely won't have it. This is a fairly useless policy goal unless you happen to be in direct competition with wealthy people for social status and scarce resources such as elite school places.
The best way to understand a wealth tax, in other words, is not in terms of rich and poor but as an intra-elite battle. The two sides are characterized by what New York Times columnist David Brooks once dubbed "status-income disequilibrium." One side consists of people whose elite jobs are well-paid compared with the national average but poorly paid compared with similarly educated and successful people in more mercenary fields, and who can therefore generally only access the best resources by leveraging family money, professional prestige or social capital. On the other side are those with more lucrative occupations who crassly buy their way in.
Heavy wealth taxation helps the former group by kneecapping their opponents without much touching their own, less tangible forms of social capital. Better still, this sounds like it does something for the poor, allowing them, and Warren, to congratulate themselves that they're really a finer grade of person, rather than some self-interested boob who votes from the pocketbook.
It's a startlingly apt summation of so much of Warren's campaign: policies that sound like they help the poor while somehow delivering the greatest benefits to the educated elites of the Acela Corridor. Booker obviously understands the reality underlying the polished populist veneer. The only question is whether Democratic voters will.

There's no more wiggle room: Win today or else

Texto completo: PHILADELPHIA - Doesn't matter that the Philadelphia Eagles could be without six starters on offense.
Doesn't matter that they won't be close to mathematical playoff elimination if they lose Sunday to the Seattle Seahawks and quarterback Russell Wilson.
The Eagles have to win or their season is on the brink.
They're 5-5 and in second place in the NFC East behind the Dallas Cowboys (6-4), who already have beaten the Eagles once.
Dallas' schedule is tougher than the Eagles', but it's not a gauntlet. After heading to Foxborough to play the Patriots, the Cowboys have home games against the Bills, Rams and Redskins, and road games against the Bears and Eagles. The Eagles and Rams are the toughest matchups, and the Rams (6-4) aren't the same squad that went to the Super Bowl last season.
For the record, the first tiebreaker is head to head, second is division record (Cowboys 4-0, Eagles 1-1) and third is record vs. common opponents (Eagles 5-3, Cowboys 2-3 - that Jets loss could be the difference for Dallas).
Lose to the Seahawks and the Eagles almost certainly have to win out to make the playoffs - and winning the division is the only way the Eagles are getting in. Forget the unlikely series of events that landed them a wild-card berth last season at 9-7. There are just too many teams ahead of them with six games to go for history to repeat (five teams have at least eight wins).
Lose to the Seahawks and the Eagles have a 28% chance of making the playoffs, according to The New York Times' simulator. Beat the Seahawks and they have a 55% chance. And even then, they're no lock if the Cowboys win the rest of their games (with the exception of their rematch with the Eagles, which the Eagles would have to win).
Just to make that much-anticipated rematch with Dallas on Dec. 22 worth it, the Eagles can't afford any more hiccups.
They need to beat a quarterback they've never beaten, one they hoped to draft in 2012.
Then they have to keep winning into December and then have quarterback Carson Wentz survive that month, which he hasn't been able to do in each of the previous two seasons.
It's time for coach Doug Pederson and his staff to unleash any look they haven't shown and do whatever is necessary to outfox the Seahawks.
It's time for Pederson and Mike Groh to show the departures of offensive coordinator Frank Reich and quarterbacks coach John DeFilippo aren't as significant as some have made them out to be.
Because Wentz has been 10-11 and the Eagles' offense hasn't been the same since the Super Bowl, a popular theory is Groh can't provide the insight or expertise that Reich did in helping Pederson form game plans and relate to players.
It's possible the Eagles would still be in this predicament even had the coaching staff remained intact. All innovative offensive (and defensive) systems, regardless of talent and wizardry, get figured out eventually. The next big thing in the league always seems to be replaced by the next big thing after a shorter run than expected. Nothing is sustainable - even in New England, which now is winning with defense instead of offense.
Point is, the Eagles are never going to be able to go back to 2017, no matter how many elderly players from that team remain.
What they can do is tap into a championship culture, dig deep and beat an opponent that's already been through the transition the Eagles are experiencing.
After back to back Super Bowl appearances, the Seahawks adjusted their defense, moving away from their popular Cover 3, because, as coach Pete Carroll noted Wednesday, everybody has seen it so many times and there are so many of his former assistants who now with other teams.
Teams have to evolve, and there's no time like the present for the Eagles to prove they can do the same. They'll be at home against a team that's had to travel across the country for a 1 p.m. matchup. They have to have it and the Seahawks don't.
So regardless of the health of wide receivers Alshon Jeffery and Nelson Agholor, running back Jordan Howard and tackles Lane Johnson and Jason Peters, they have to find a way to win.
Sunday's game is the season. And they have to play that way.

Texto completo: My parents didn't speak the same language, but that didn't stop them from falling in love.
As a child, I kept photos of my parents in an old, torn shoe box. I'd often gaze at the ones of them posing with my dad's 1947 Harley Davidson Knucklehead, and try to imagine their days before I came along. I'd wonder: What was it like for a white Appalachian man and a Salvadoran woman to ride a motorcycle cross-country in the postwar years? How had their love endured at a time when many Americans were hostile to interracial marriage?
My father, Ralph, joined the Navy in 1942. That same year, my mother, Amanda, and her family immigrated to San Francisco from El Salvador. My mother, who was 16 at the time, went to work in a factory, stitching closed the bullet holes in Navy life preservers, and washing the blood out of the cloth before they were sent out once again to the ships in the South Pacific.
After the war, Dad moved to San Francisco. He planned to save up to buy a Harley and drive it across the country. My parents first saw each other in a coffee shop in the city's Mission District. My dad pretended to read The San Francisco Chronicle while stealing glances at my mother from his booth. "¡Ay, sus ojos tan verdes!" Mamá would tell me growing up -- he had green eyes, the color of fecundity back in the old country.
He eventually worked up the nerve to walk over and ask if he could join her. He didn't understand a lick of Spanish. She spoke a little English, but she had a hard time making out his Appalachian drawl, with its elongated words and drawn-out syntax. They may not have understood one another, but that didn't stop them from falling in love. He asked her to marry him three weeks after they met, but she declined at first -- "Know you I do not," she said. After six months, she finally said yes.
My dad did eventually save up enough for the Harley. For their honeymoon, they drove to Tennessee to meet his family. It would be the first of seven trips they took across the United States on that bike. They'd return to San Francisco's Mission District to visit my grandmother when Mamá would get homesick. But after a couple of weeks, they'd ride back to Tennessee. Sometimes they just got the wanderlust, hopped on the motorcycle and hit the road. When I was 16, the photos and their stories were too much to handle. It pains a teenager to know that his parents were far cooler than he will ever be.
They might have been too blind with love to worry about any racial concerns, but in Tennessee, they got a heaping dose of it. My white grandparents had never heard of El Salvador. They couldn't make heads or tails out of who, or what, my mother was. She wasn't black, but she sure wasn't white. They told my dad he had tarnished the family name, and worried about grandchildren born with a brown taint.
We left San Francisco for good when I was 4 years old. I spent the bulk of my childhood years in the Appalachian Mountains, where, in the 1960s, my mother and I were the only Latinos in the town of Rogersville, Tenn. Back then I was an oddity, a mix between a white local and a brown foreigner. In local parlance, a half breed. A mongrel.
Mamá did her best to imbue me with an appreciation for our rich Latino heritage, which I would later honor by taking her last name. She cooked Salvadoran pupusas, tamales and black beans. She taught me how to move my hips to the rhythm of Latin music. She told me about the Salvadoran legend of La Siguanaba, a witch that rewarded good, respectful men with small cloth bags of gold, and ripped out the guts of bad men who treated women as objects to conquer. Hers was a silent, loving, guerrilla warfare against the racial thinking of the South, where white and brown love was a crime against nature.
I can only imagine how hard it was for my father. People made comments about him marrying a "light-skinned nigger." They asked what was it like to take an exotic foreigner to bed. He suffered this in silence, and spoke of it only in his later years. He never told me what people said about his son.
There are some who believe that the Latinos at our southern gate are a menace to their American way of life. But the thousands of migrants from Mexico and Central America who work our crops and butcher our chickens -- jobs that few American citizens want to fill -- are woven into the fabric of this country. Along the way they're falling in love, just as my parents did. I'm part of this mestizaje, the multicultural mixing of America.
I look at those old, yellowed pictures now, 72 years after they were taken. An Appalachian white man, a Salvadoran woman and a Harley. You can't get much more American than that.

Better, Cheaper and Faster Than Amazon

Texto completo: It's cheaper and more efficient than ordering from Amazon. But American capitalism has turned against small business.
On Ninth Avenue in Manhattan, not far from where I live, there's a small neighborhood hardware store called Chelsea Convenience Hardware, which is distinguished by its unlikely display of dozens of Russian nesting dolls in the storefront window. Inside, tools and supplies are piled to the ceiling, and when you enter, the owner, Naum Feygin, an immigrant from Boris Yeltsin's Russia, looks up to ask you what you need.
The "convenience" in the store's name is no misnomer, for the place is extraordinarily efficient. It is cheaper and faster than ordering from Amazon and offers expert advice that reduces the risk of buying the wrong thing. It is all too easy on Amazon, for example, to buy halogen bulbs that don't fit your lamp base; Mr. Feygin has spared me many such headaches. And the store's small size is a virtue: Unlike at Home Depot, you can be in and out in 10 minutes.
Nonetheless, Chelsea Convenience is set to close at the end of November, another casualty of rising commercial rents and competition from e-commerce. The closing is of no great economic significance, other than to Mr. Feygin. But it is a microcosm of the forces reshaping the United States economy, often paradoxically and for the worse. Why is a less efficient, less personalized and more wasteful way of buying screws and plungers -- ordering online -- displacing the local hardware store?
Mr. Feygin, who is both the owner and main employee of his store, was born in the Soviet Union in 1962. Like many Russians, he took a chance at the end of the Cold War to come to the United States. The Soviet economy hadn't exactly rewarded entrepreneurship, and an older cousin living in New York City promised great things. "There's money on the streets here," Mr. Feygin recalls his cousin saying. "I'm too old to pick it up. You come, you pick it up."
The American economy in the 1990s may not have offered instant riches, but it did offer genuine opportunities for people like Mr. Feygin. The economy was growing fast and was structurally different from what it is today: more open, less consolidated and free of onerous rents, even in big cities.
Arriving in 1991, Mr. Feygin first worked at a hospital and then tried selling musical instruments, without much success. He had more luck selling Russian souvenirs at flea markets -- the hand-painted dolls and other Soviet curios that now populate his storefront window. "I must have put the prices too low," he says, because the souvenirs kept selling out. He saved his money, and he and his wife had two children. In 1997, as the economy boomed, he bought the hardware store and has run it ever since.
Sometimes neighborhood stores close because their business model is no longer viable, as with video rental stores in the age of on-demand streaming. But that isn't the case with Chelsea Convenience. Not only does it offer neighborhood residents better prices and greater convenience than Amazon offers for small-ticket items like screws and superglue; it is also of immense value to the superintendents, plumbers, electricians and others who repair and maintain buildings in the area. For these workers, Chelsea Convenience offers an array of specialized parts that might otherwise be difficult or impossible to obtain in a timely manner.
In this way, stores like Chelsea Convenience are a vital part of the infrastructure of a city. They also play a social role in the neighborhood that enterprises like Amazon and eBay cannot replicate. That this is a cliché of the mom-and-pop shop makes it no less true. Chelsea Convenience is a social hub; it seems as if someone from the neighborhood is always hanging out, chatting about something. "People come in here," Mr. Feygin says, turning up his palms in a gesture of blasé wonderment. "They want to talk about their life, my life."
According to Mr. Feygin, business began to slow down about three years ago, despite the growing economy. "Amazon, eBay," he explains. "People ordering without advice." They might not get what they need, but still they order online.
Here we can see how an ideology of convenience is reshaping the economy. Ordering things like tape or bolts online is rarely cheaper or faster than popping down to the local hardware store -- not to mention the wasteful packaging -- but many of us do it anyhow. Clicking on a product from the comfort of your couch seems more convenient -- and that impression of ease can have more influence on our behavior than better service, quicker acquisition and lower prices.
Even more damaging than the competition from Amazon, according to Mr. Feygin, was a huge rent increase. He says he faced a near-doubling of rent, from about $ 6,000 to $ 10,800 per month, for his 600 square feet. Property taxes, which are tied to property values, also rose sharply. It was too much.
Competition from Amazon and a rent increase might seem like distinct phenomena, but they are two sides of the same coin. Both reflect the transformative consolidation and centralization of the American economy since the 1990s, which have made the economy less open to individual entrepreneurship. Amazon represents the increasing monopolization of retail; the high rents are a symptom of the enormous concentration of wealth in a handful of coastal cities like New York, San Francisco and Washington.
Both phenomena contribute to the same regrettable outcome: In today's economy, returns on investment have shifted away from the individuals like Mr. Feygin who take personal risks. Instead, wealth is being routed to large middlemen, national monopolies, property owners and shareholders.
So Chelsea Convenience is scheduled to shut down on Nov. 30, not because of a recession or poor business decisions, but because of what amounts to a fundamental change in American capitalism. Mr. Feygin played by the rules as they were in the 1990s, when success in business mainly meant selling goods above cost. But that isn't enough anymore.
The fate of Chelsea Convenience shows, in its small way, that business and capitalism can be at odds -- that the drive for immense capital gains can drain the life out of human-scale business. For entrepreneurs, the American economy, with its extreme centralization, is becoming more like the Soviet economy Mr. Feygim left behind.
As for Mr. Feygin himself, he isn't sure what he will do next. "It is hard," he says, "very hard." He had hoped that his son, Willem, would want to take over the store. But Willem is "not so stupid," Mr. Feygin says. "He works for a hedge fund."

Texto completo: MEXICO CITY -- Evo Morales, the ousted president of Bolivia, now lives in exile on a military base in Mexico City, where he says he spends much of the day taking calls from Bolivians pleading for his help.
More than 3,000 miles from his country, where politicians are threatening to have him arrested if he returns, Mr. Morales is still trying to carry on as the president who delivers for his constituents -- in his eyes, the savior of Bolivia.
And yet, Mr. Morales seemed to acknowledge during an interview that his time in power -- and his worldwide renown as Bolivia's first Indigenous president -- had come to an end.
After almost 14 years in power, he left the country with what he said was little more than the clothes on his back. He had run for a fourth term, and declared himself the winner, but the election result was in dispute.
With protesters blocking the streets, and his police and military turning against him, he was spirited out of the country by a Mexican military plane and arrived in Mexico City on Nov. 12. It all happened so fast that he left behind his Bolivian passport, he said.
"I am already Mexican. Look," he joked, brandishing his new Mexican immigration permit at the start of an interview at the offices of The New York Times in Mexico City on Friday.
He was driven to the interview in a sport utility vehicle and hustled from the street into the building by Mexico's equivalent of the secret service.
In a photo session, he raised a fist in the defiant gesture of a revolutionary leader.
He said that he is still the president of his country, at least until Jan. 22, when his term officially ends, and should be allowed to return to Bolivia to finish out the last two months of his presidency.
"Here, what can we do?" he asked, regret in his voice. "We have to defend, not just defend Evo, defend the social programs."
He is convinced that there is a resounding call for him to return to Bolivia, and that the country cannot progress without him. His party, which has a majority in congress, has proposed granting him and his inner circle immunity from prosecution, according to a local news report.
But events in Bolivia's administrative capital, La Paz, have rushed forward since he left. Amid continuing protests by his supporters and violent crackdowns by security forces, his own party and the opposition are working on passing legislation that would pave the way for new elections, The Associated Press reported.
He shrugged off statements from some in his own party that they will run new candidates in new elections, declaring that it's only "some compañeros who I think are not listening to the people's clamorous demand."
He promised to support his party's candidate for president, calling it an obligation. And he added that now that he is "freed from being president," he will have more time to campaign for his party's candidates.
In a tone far more subdued than in some other recent public appearances, he spoke nostalgically about his country. He said that he missed the coca leaf -- a stimulant that many Bolivians chew: He is the longtime leader of the union of coca growers.
He joked that Mexican food was a little too spicy, and that he had to learn to eat tortillas instead of quinoa.
The Mexican government offered Mr. Morales asylum and welcomed him as it would a dignitary: He was greeted by the foreign minister when he landed in Mexico City and named a distinguished guest by the city's mayor.
President Andrés Manuel López Obrador assigned military officers who belonged to the disbanded presidential guard to protect him. The government settled him into a military facility that he has been told not to identify for security reasons.
He admitted that he now feels caged, beginning his days with a jog in the base's gym at 6 a.m. He lives there with a small entourage that accompanied him into exile, including his vice president, Alvaro García Linera, and his health minister, Dr. Gabriela Montaño.
His two children, he said, were expected to arrive in Argentina on Saturday, and were not planning to come to Mexico.
He spends his days giving interviews to the media, he said, his voice trailing off.
He spoke with longing for the days when he traveled through Bolivia with the power to oversee the building of public projects for Bolivia's Indigenous communities, the poorest people in one of the poorest countries in South America.
"I miss that," he said. "Delivering public works, approving new works, knowing Bolivia better, its needs. That is the job. For me you do not govern just in the palace, you govern in every part of the country."
But he had no regrets, he said -- not about his decision to run for a fourth term, or the presidential election in October that set off rioting after he declared that he had won.
He said that he resigned the presidency three weeks later to save the lives of his supporters whose houses had been burned down by opponents.
He decided to leave for Mexico he said, to save lives, perhaps even his own. He said that a member of his security team had showed him an anonymous text message claiming that there was a $ 50,000 bounty on his head to arrest or even kill him.
It was not the step that a revolutionary would take, he acknowledged, quoting Fidel Castro's slogan "Fatherland or Death." He said that he resisted at first, but his ministers persuaded him to leave.
The Mexican government sent a plane but for hours it was unable to land, as the Bolivian military placed bureaucratic obstacles in its way. Finally, a full day after he resigned, the plane took off.
"When we were in the airplane, I said, 'our lives are safe,"' he recalled.
While he was on his way out, he said he heard that the United States government had spoken to his foreign minister and offered to send its own plane to take him out of the country. He said that he had joked, "Maybe they will take me to Guantánamo."
Washington and his political opponents were determined to keep him out of Bolivia, he said.
"I am not desperate to be president, but they should give me my political rights, so that I can go back," he said. "Why are they so afraid of Evo?"

Texto completo: On Nov. 15, 1968, the New York Times carried the news on its front page: 'Yale Going Coed Next September.' The historic change came after student activists pressured Yale's hesitant president, Kingman Brewster, to stop delaying and finally admit women as undergraduates. The day before the Times article, he put the question before the Yale College faculty. The vote in favor was overwhelming: 200 to 1.
In 'Yale Needs Women: How the First Group of Girls Rewrote the Rules of an Ivy League Giant,' historian and higher-education expert Anne Gardiner Perkins tells the tale of Yale's early days as a coed campus for undergraduates after 267 years as a male-only bastion. Perkins charts the years between 1968 and late 1972, when Yale ditched its gender quota. 'Yale Needs Women' explores female students' experiences, from dating to work-study to forming the first varsity sports teams. While the book feels a bit parochial because it never leaves Yale's campus, Perkins has delivered an engaging and surprising story that illustrates the challenges college women have confronted across the country. Her narrative made this recent college grad feel grateful to the women who came before her.

A turning point in Yale's move toward inclusion occurred just 11 days before the Times story rolled off the presses. On Nov. 4, students launched Coeducation Week at Yale to 'prove to alumni and the public that Yale students were 'serious and sincere about normal coeducational life in the near future,' ' as leader Avi Soifer put it.
Some 750 women from nearby colleges descended on Yale, lived 'in dorm rooms vacated by obliging Yale students,' attended classes, and participated in forums and panels on coeducation. As Perkins explains, the week gave 'Yale men the chance to interact with the opposite sex 'under more natural conditions than the infamous mixer.' '
Toward the end of the week, hundreds of students marched to Brewster's home, where the president and his wife came out onto the front porch. ' 'Give us a date!' the students cried, urging Brewster to commit to coeducation,' Perkins writes. When Brewster promised that women would be on campus by 1972 " four years away " the students shouted back: 'Next fall! . . . 1969!'
Coeducation Week garnered national publicity and stirred Brewster to action. On Nov. 7, Perkins writes, 'Brewster called a meeting with a one-item agenda: admitting women undergraduates to Yale.' Two days later, he was in New York presenting the proposal to Yale's board of trustees, which voted to accept about 500 women for the fall of 1969.
While Yale acted quickly under intense pressure, it was late among elite colleges to admit female undergraduates. Harvard, Cornell and Brown had already turned their campuses coed, and Princeton planned to enroll women as undergrads in the fall of 1969. Enrolling female students was now a competitive advantage for those schools. '[Yale] Trustee Irwin Miller had been arguing for coeducation since 1967,' Perkins writes, 'warning that 'the quality of admission at Yale . . . will undergo a long, slow decline unless there are women.' '







But their arrival at Yale, as Perkins shows, was fraught with challenges. The new enrollees faced exaggerated expectations. A New York Times Magazine article portrayed female applicants as superlative students with remarkable accomplishments already in their brief lives. 'Of the entire eleven-page article,' Perkins writes, 'what Yale's women undergraduates remember most is what the New York Times called them. They were 'the female versions of Friedrich Nietzsche's Uebermensch.' They were 'superwomen.' The word stuck like a mark on the forehead of every girl admitted.'
Thousands of women applied for 575 spots in the fall of 1969. Women faced much tougher acceptance rates " about 1 in 12 compared with 1 in 7 for men " because of the gender quota and a highly subjective admissions process that favored men over women.

Perkins offers intriguing insights into the stories of Yale's female students. There's Connie Royster, whose family members had worked at Yale for generations and whose aunt was the first black female federal judge, appointed in 1966. And Kit McClure, who with her trombone elbowed her way into the school's marching band and went on to be an active feminist and a successful musician. Perkins follows another dozen or so women as they navigated the sexism and sexual harassment of an institution not designed to accommodate them.
While Yale's graduate and professional schools were technically coed in 1968, women felt the burden of their small numbers. 'Invisible is the word they used to describe themselves,' Perkins writes. Female graduate students (notably future Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen and future senator and presidential nominee Hillary Rodham Clinton) composed less than 10 percent of the student body and were spread out across 11 schools. The undergraduates who followed felt similar pressures. 'To be a young woman at Yale,' Perkins explains, 'was to be simultaneously invisible yet unable to blend in.'
Her book invites other schools and scholars to recognize the pioneering women of their own institutions. Yale's alumni have helped compile an impressive website dedicated to the history of women at the college. My own alma mater, Georgetown's College of Arts and Sciences, is also celebrating its 50th anniversary of enrolling women, with plans to commemorate this milestone in the spring.
Hanna Rosin's 'The End of Men: And the Rise of Women' and Nancy Weiss Malkiel's ' 'Keep the Damned Women Out': The Struggle for Coeducation' complement 'Yale Needs Women' by helping to put the achievements in perspective. As Rosin wrote in her book, 'Women's dominance on college campuses is possibly the strangest and most profound change of the century.'

Texto completo: Many have long begged for classical music to loosen up the dress codes for its performers. The pianist Conrad Tao must have taken this to heart on Wednesday at Weill Recital Hall: He wore black slacks and a black T-shirt -- sometimes with a black jacket, sometimes not -- and, most unusual, went barefoot.
His outfit for this, his Carnegie Hall recital debut, seemed less a statement against stuffy concert protocols and more an earnest welcome to his audience: We could have been dropping in on this prodigiously gifted 25-year-old pianist (also a composer) at his apartment in Washington Heights, a few miles north of Carnegie. His real statement on Wednesday was artistic, expressed through the "constellation" of his program (the word he used in a recent New York Times interview to describe his way of juxtaposing old and new works) and his fiercely individual performances.
Mr. Tao showed various ways in which composers have explored virtuosity at the piano over three centuries. But virtuosity can involve more than pyrotechnic display, as Mr. Tao made beautifully clear in David Lang's "cage," which opened the program. This short work, dedicated to John Cage, is a subdued study in soft, keyboard-spanning tremolos that create harmonically shifting spans of sound. He then turned immediately to Bach's Toccata in F sharp minor, which in this context -- and in Mr. Tao's full-bodied, articulate performance -- came across like a more overtly virtuosic exercise.
The title of Elliott Carter's "Two Thoughts About the Piano," which came next, suggests that its composer, then in his late 90s, was rethinking what the piano is capable of. The formidably difficult first piece is a study in violent contrasts, with bursts of slashing chords and sinewy runs. The second is like a flinty, modernist étude that unfolds in one breakneck, twisting line, with no chords. Mr. Tao's playing was steely and exhilarating.
On his new album, "American Rage," Mr. Tao programmed a teeming piece by Julia Wolfe written in reaction to Sept. 11. On Wednesday, he performed her "Earring," in which the right hand plays spiky dance rhythms in the piano's high register while the left hand hovers below in shifting chords and sonorities.
Rachmaninoff, represented here by his mercurial Étude-Tableau in A minor, held his own quite well with all these living composers, thanks to Mr. Tao's subtle performance. Mr. Lang's bittersweet "wed" provided a glistening, delicate contrast.
Then Mr. Tao tore into Jason Eckardt's "Echoes' White Veil," a ferocious 11-minute work, all frenzied eruptions of hellbent runs and leaping chords. It was an inspired idea to go without break into Schumann's "Kreisleriana." Mr. Tao carried this 19th-century classic, a fantastical 30-minute suite, into the 21st century, bringing out inner voices, pungent harmonies and obsessive rhythmic elements that many pianists gloss over.
For an encore, Mr. Tao played an arrangement of the singer-songwriter Daniel Johnston's "True Love Will Find You in the End," dedicated to its composer, who died in September. While playing, Mr. Tao sang the lyrics in a soft, earthy voice. Not many virtuosos would attempt something so revealing.

Texto completo: A speech by Mr. Barr last week, in which he argued that Mr. Trump had never overstepped his authority, so alarmed a group of lawyers that they felt compelled to push back publicly.
WASHINGTON -- A group of conservative-leaning lawyers criticized Attorney General William P. Barr for the expansive view of presidential power he espoused in a recent speech and for his conclusion this spring that President Trump had not obstructed justice in the Russia investigation.
"In recent months, we have become concerned by the conduct of Attorney General William Barr," the group, Checks & Balances, said in a statement that was shared Friday with The New York Times.
Members of the group have sharply denounced what they described as abuses of power by Mr. Trump, who is facing a fast-moving impeachment inquiry. The speech by Mr. Barr last week, in which he argued that the president had never overstepped his authority, so alarmed them that they felt compelled to push back publicly.
The Justice Department declined to comment.
At a conference hosted by the Federalist Society, an influential conservative legal group, Mr. Barr said in his speech that those who have sought to hem in Mr. Trump were denying the will of voters, subverting the Constitution and undermining the rule of law.
The president's opponents "essentially see themselves as engaged in a war to cripple by any means necessary a duly elected government," he said.
Checks & Balances is made up of Republican and conservative lawyers, including some who served in recent administrations. George T. Conway III, one of Mr. Trump's most vocal critics and the husband of the White House counselor, Kellyanne Conway, is one of the group's most prominent members.
Mr. Barr's view on executive power is a misreading of the unitary executive theory, said Charles Fried, a Checks & Balances member and Harvard Law professor who endorsed the theory while he was solicitor general during the Reagan administration. In Mr. Fried's reading of the theory, "the executive branch cannot be broken up into fragments."
While that branch acts as a unified expression of a president's priorities, with the president firmly at the helm, "it is also clear that the executive branch is subject to law," Mr. Fried said. "Barr takes that notion and eliminates the 'under law' part."
While Mr. Barr did not use the word "impeachment" in his speech, he laid out a new defense of Mr. Trump that was taken up by Republicans on Capitol Hill. In an effort to invalidate the inquiry, lawmakers had argued that the president did not withhold a White House meeting or military aid to pressure President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine to publicly announce investigations that would benefit Mr. Trump politically.
After a week of damaging public hearings in which multiple witnesses offered new details of the president's pressure campaign and said that he spoke openly of his desire that Ukraine publicly announce investigations, Mr. Trump's supporters began to argue that he had acted within his rights.
Mr. Trump has also begun to echo Mr. Barr's assertions. In an interview on Fox on Friday, he said that the decision to investigate his 2016 campaign's ties to Russia "was an overthrow attempt at the presidency."
Now that the claim that Mr. Trump never pressured Mr. Zelensky no longer holds, "the argument has got to be a 'so what' argument -- Bill Barr's argument that the president did all these things, but this is what a president can do," said Stuart Gerson, a Checks & Balances member who was a senior campaign adviser to George Bush and a Justice Department official in his administration.
"The Republicans in the Senate and in the House think they're in a Parliament, and their responsibility is to a prime minister to whom they owe party loyalty," Mr. Gerson said. "That's not the American tradition. One can recognize substantial executive power, but that doesn't mean the legislative branch should be dead."
Mr. Barr has argued that his view of presidential power stems directly from the Constitution. It delineates the responsibilities of the three branches of government, he has said, rather than allowing the legislature and the judiciary to check the powers of the president as two of three co-equal governing powers.
That interpretation of history "has no factual basis," Checks & Balances wrote in its statement, including the claim that "the founders shared in any respect his vision of an unchecked president, and his assertion that this view was dominant until it came under attack from courts and Congress a few decades ago."
The group said that the "only imaginable basis" for Mr. Barr's conclusion that Mr. Trump did not obstruct the Russia investigation "was his legal view that the president is given total control over all investigations by the Constitution."
Mr. Fried suggested that Mr. Barr's interpretation of the law set a dangerous precedent. "Conservatism is respect for the rule of law. It is respect for tradition," he said. "The people who claim they're conservatives today are demanding loyalty to this completely lawless, ignorant, foul-mouthed president."
Mr. Gerson echoed that sentiment. "It's important for conservatives to speak up," he said. "This administration is anything but conservative."

Texto completo: A reader suggests that having two candidates at a time sitting with a moderator would be more useful.
To the Editor:
Re "Democrats Soften Disagreements and Sharpen Attacks on Trump" (front page, Nov. 21):
I was relieved to learn that voters are at last putting climate change atop their list of priorities, but saving Earth means we must first vote Donald Trump firmly and finally out of office. So I was dismayed to see yet another incoherent sound-bite contest masquerading as a debate among the candidates vying to defeat him. Couldn't the Democratic National Committee or MSNBC come up with a better idea? (Rachel Maddow, I'm looking at you.)
Why not have two candidates at a time sit with a moderator for 15 or 30 minutes and freely discuss voters' top two or three concerns? If all 10 candidates were interviewed the same night, it would take no more time than the pointless charades to which we've been treated so far, and it would be a lot more useful, dignified and informative.

7 Russians Suspended for Obstructing Investigation, Deepening Crisis

Texto completo: The bans deepened a crisis for Russian sports that soon could see the country barred from next summer's Tokyo Olympics and other major international sporting events.
The president of Russia's track and field governing body was among seven people suspended on Thursday for obstructing an antidoping investigation, deepening a crisis for Russian sports that soon could see the country barred from next summer's Tokyo Olympics and other major international sporting events.
The Athletics Integrity Unit, an independent investigative arm of track and field's global governing body, which was recently renamed World Athletics, said it had charged the Russian federation president, Dmitri Shlyakhtin; four other officials; a coach; and an athlete with numerous offenses, including providing forged documents, false explanations and tampering with evidence in a case involving a Russian high jumper accused of failing to make himself available for drug testing.
The announcement, which was the culmination of a 15-month inquiry, came only weeks before the World Anti-Doping Agency is to decide whether to impose tough new penalties on Russian sports.
World Athletics has been one of the few international sports federations that have continued to take a hard line against Russia after the 2015 revelations of a massive state-backed doping program that for years corrupted a series of major sporting events. Since November 2015, Russia has been barred from international track and field events, including the last two world championships. Russian athletes can only appear in competitions as authorized neutrals, and only after vetting by antidoping experts.
A result has been a sort of track and field purgatory for Russian athletes. At last month's world championships in Doha, Qatar, Russian competitors were not allowed to wear their national colors or hear their national anthem during the meet -- a lingering sign of how their country's systematic cheating scheme continues to cast a pall over international sports.
Thursday's new suspensions raised the risk that Russia could have its longstanding suspension from World Athletics extended, or increased to a full expulsion from global track and field. In a statement, the Athletics Integrity Unit said the Russian federation had until Dec. 12 to offer a response. Any penalty will be decided by the governing council of World Athletics.
That group is meeting Friday, when it will receive an update from a separate Russia task force being led by the Norwegian antidoping specialist Rune Andersen. That group is likely to underline continued Russian intransigence in antidoping efforts, including revelations in September -- confirmed by Russia's top antidoping official -- that a Moscow laboratory had manipulated thousands of athlete records in an attempt to cover up failed drug tests by athletes before providing the data to WADA investigators.
The integrity unit contended in Thursday's announcement that data manipulation was at the heart of its case, which started as an investigation into the high jumper Danil Lysenko for a third so-called "whereabouts" failure in June last year.
"The A.I.U. investigated the veracity of the explanations provided by Danil Lysenko to explain his whereabouts failures and concluded that the explanations were false and supported by forged documents," it said in a statement.
That led investigators to look into whether officials from the Russian athletics federation, known as RusAF, were complicit in devising Lysenko's attempts to avoid punishment. A final decision was reached after interviewing 22 witnesses and analyzing the contents of hard drives and phone data, according to the investigative unit.
Thursday's actions are expected to be only a precursor to far heavier punishment. WADA's executive board was expected this week to receive a report into Russian antidoping compliance from a committee led by the British lawyer Jonathan Taylor. Taylor previously told The New York Times that Russia would need to "pull a rabbit out of the hat" to provide a credible explanation for manipulated drug-testing data that it had promised to share with WADA as a condition of ending a ban on Russia's national antidoping agency.
The WADA board will meet on Dec. 9 to consider the recommendations in the report, which are almost certain to include a call for Russia to be deemed noncompliant again. That designation should see Russia barred from competing in or hosting international sporting events, including, but not limited to, the 2020 Olympics and European soccer championships.

Texto completo: Jon Voight, James Patterson and Alison Krauss were among the honorees.
WASHINGTON -- In honoring the actor Jon Voight, an outspoken Trump supporter, with the National Medal of the Arts on Thursday, President Trump described him as "somebody I happen to really like."
In introducing the author James Patterson as a recipient of the National Humanities Medal, Mr. Trump called him "another friend of mine," although he failed to mention that Mr. Patterson was also a dues-paying member of his Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Fla.
The Claremont Institute, a conservative think tank whose alumni have gone on to serve in the Trump administration, also received a humanities award.
And in his remarks about Sharon Percy Rockefeller, a longtime advocate for public broadcasting and the former president and chief executive of WETA in the Washington area, who was also chosen as an arts medal recipient, Mr. Trump joked that "maybe I'll start getting good publicity" from shows like "PBS NewsHour" and "Washington Week."
"They tend to be on the other side of things, a little bit," he added. "I think now I have a better chance."
Throughout a brief and relatively sedate ceremony in the East Room presenting medals celebrating the arts and humanities for the first time since he assumed office, the president made it clear that his own relationship to the artists or patrons of the arts, and their support for him, were front of mind as much as their collective contributions to society.
The pattern was a familiar one. In the past, Mr. Trump has also used the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor, to celebrate friends and business partners like Tiger Woods.
Other recipients on Thursday like the chef Patrick J. O'Connell; Teresa Lozano Long, a philanthropist based in Austin, Texas; and the bluegrass musician and singer Alison Krauss had no clear links to the president.
But since the 1980s, when the United States began recognizing its greatest artists with the national medals, recipients have always been handpicked by the president, with input from members of the National Council on the Arts, and reflected their tastes if not their political affiliations.
Past recipients have included Georgia O'Keeffe, Frank Capra and Ella Fitzgerald. President Barack Obama's list of recipients in 2016 included Berry Gordy, the founder of Motown Records; the composer Philip Glass; the authors Sandra Cisneros and Ron Chernow; the poet Louise Glück; and the chef José Andrés.
Mr. Trump has presided over the longest gap in history during which none of the medals were given out, at all, a drought that came as Mr. Trump released budgets that sought to eliminate two agencies that support the arts, the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities.
In past years, presidents typically selected about a dozen recipients for each medal. Last week, the White House announced that Mr. Trump had chosen just eight recipients in total for both awards.
Arts advocates said they were simply happy to see any artist, or patron of the arts, honored at the White House, even if there were fewer of them and the crowd lacked diversity.
"Every president picks their own list of people, and we are just happy to see the arts be honored," said Robert L. Lynch, the president of Americans for the Arts, a national lobbying group. "The medal is not about Trump. The medal is about America, and about our government honoring artists and humanists as something that is important to our country."
But other members of the creative community were less open-minded about what it meant to receive a medal celebrating the arts from Mr. Trump.
"There's no question that the deficit in empathy and humanity that the president displays would make getting an award from him an awkward predicament," said Leon Botstein, a conductor and the president of Bard College. "One wants the nation to honor its artists, but on the other hand it's an embarrassment given the values he stands for."
In receiving her award, Ms. Krauss, who has won more Grammy Awards than any other female musician, seemed to embody the tension. She appeared to be polite to Mr. Trump, but also at times seemed to avoid his gaze. "Look how shy she is," Mr. Trump said.
In the past, nominations came in from the public and from members of the National Council on the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities. Those recommendations were passed onto the president, who would make the final decision. The process was always somewhat political, with presidents ultimately choosing recipients who fit their own agendas.
A spokeswoman for the National Endowment for the Arts said that the process this year was run according to the federal regulations that guide that process. But she would not say whether any of Mr. Trump's selections were from the list of people who had been recommended to him.
A White House spokesman added that the staff secretary had also solicited nominees from cabinet officials and senior White House staff members.

Texto completo: The Democratic presidential candidates expressed uniform support Wednesday night for the impeachment inquiry into President Trump's conduct toward Ukraine, but signaled significant reservations in the fifth primary debate about the possibility that the 2020 campaign could become submerged in a congressional investigation of Trump's behavior.
The debate in Atlanta began with few sparks between the leading candidates, but a barrage of fire directed at Trump and what the top Democrats described as a culture of corruption and self-dealing in his administration. That line of argument crossed ideological and cultural lines on the Democratic side, involving populist liberals like Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont and their more moderate competitors, including Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind.
“We cannot simply be consumed by Donald Trump, because if we are, you know what? We're going to lose the election," Sanders said, pointing to social problems like homelessness and climate change, which he termed “the great existential crisis of our time."
But the seeds of a larger debate over policy and political strategy became evident even in their answers targeting Trump. Sanders and Warren railed against corruption in Washington, while other candidates, including Buttigieg and former vice president Joe Biden, emphasized the importance of forging political unity and electing Democratic senators from red states.
Biden, who has staked his campaign on the perception that he is a strong general election candidate, used his leadoff answer to urge Democratic voters to pick a nominee who can “go into states like Georgia and North Carolina and other places and get a Senate majority."
It was, atypically, Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, normally a nonconfrontational voice on the debate stage, who opened a more contentious phase of the debate, critiquing Warren's proposal for a tax on the nation's largest fortunes. “It's cumbersome," Booker jabbed. “It's been tried by other nations. It's hard to evaluate."
Warren retorted, “I'm tired of freeloading billionaires."
Buttigieg soon followed suit in criticizing the leftward tilt of some of the candidates, arguing that most Americans were on their side — but warning that Democrats must “galvanize not polarize that majority."
Sanders made the case for his “Medicare for All" legislation and took an oblique shot at Warren, who has not prioritized the measure, noting that he would introduce his single-payer “in the first week" of his presidency.
But reflecting his de facto truce with Warren, Sanders reserved his sharpest words for the more moderate candidates who oppose Medicare for All, whom he did not name but whom he described as believing “that we should not take on the insurance industry, we should not take on the pharmaceutical industry."
On another policy question, California Senator Kamala Harris said she has crafted her plans for paid family leave around what she characterizes as a campaign-wide position on policies to help elevate women.
The California senator said that much of the “burden" of raising children and caring for aging parents falls to women, who she noted are “not paid equally for equal work in America."
Harris's plan would provide leave for up to six months, a timeframe she said was selected in part due to women having children later in life than in previous generations.
Klobuchar's own plan would cover up to three months. She said she kept plan costs in mind when selecting that timeline, noting an obligation to being “fiscally responsible" while still helping people.
The Democrats met just hours after the administration's ambassador to the European Union, Gordon D. Sondland, offered perhaps the most damaging testimony against Trump yet in the House impeachment proceeding. The inquiry has worried some Democrats about the former vice president's viability in a general election.
Yet that is only one factor that is making an already volatile race more fluid than ever.
Since the debate last month, former governor Deval Patrick of Massachusetts has entered the primary contest, and former mayor Michael Bloomberg of New York has taken steps to do the same. They have been lured into the campaign in part over their concerns about the leftward drift in the party, and also because there is still no clear front-runner with a little more than two months until the Iowa caucuses.
It remains far from certain that they will be able to catch on so late in the race, but both have made clear that they are trying to win over more moderate voters.
If there is an opening for them, it is because Biden has not been able to consolidate support from center-left Democrats.
More broadly, though, the race remains unsettled because Democratic voters are splintered across racial, ideological, and generational lines. Buttigieg surged in Iowa and New Hampshire in recent weeks, taking the lead in a new Des Moines Register-CNN survey of Iowa caucusgoers.
Biden is strong in Nevada, where Hispanic and Asian American voters play a key role, and in South Carolina, where African-Americans are expected to make up a majority of the Democratic electorate.
The two leading populists in the field, Warren and Sanders, also are in the top tier in some early-state surveys thanks to strong support from self-identified liberals and many younger voters. But both have been unable to broaden their appeal to moderate Democrats. Together, these fractures have effectively created a four-way race, with none of the leading contenders yet proving they can break out of their demographic niche.
Warren had shown the most progress in expanding her coalition beyond white liberals, but she has endured a rocky stretch since coming under attack in the last debate over her failure to outline how she would pay for Medicare for All.
Last week she sought to tamp down criticism by unveiling a proposal for how to pay for her single-payer plan.
However, no candidate may have gained more from Warren's struggles than Buttigieg, who was one of her most aggressive critics in the last debate.
Already a favorite of many in the Democratic donor class, whose support has allowed him to finance a well-funded advertising campaign, Buttigieg, 37, has gained support with a sharp pivot toward the political center. His run from the left, where he positioned himself earlier in the race, has infuriated his rivals who view him as a politically elastic opportunist. But before the debate on Wednesday, Buttigieg had yet to sustain any damaging attacks for his recalibration.

Texto completo: The Democratic establishment despises the insurgent candidacy of Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii. From her decision to buck party orthodoxy and endorse Sen. Bernie Sanders in 2016 over Democratic National Committee favorite Hillary Clinton, to her constant criticisms of Democratic foreign policy mistakes, Gabbard has made herself no friends with the party elite. She's perfectly fine with that if it's required to put the people first.
Still, this means establishment Democrats and their allies regularly smear and attack the Democratic congresswoman. But, as if we need more proof of how deranged the establishment’s hatred for Gabbard has become, the New York Times style section is now criticizing her… wardrobe? TweetIn a piece titled “Tulsi Gabbard’s white pantsuit isn’t winning,” Times style writer Vanessa Friedman savages the congresswoman for her choice of wardrobe. Friedman correctly notes that Gabbard has made the white pantsuit her defining campaign look, wearing the iconic outfit in most of the debates and much of her prominent campaign promotional material.
Yet where Friedman goes seriously, sinisterly wrong is arguing that the look isn’t working, and sinking into deranged, hypocritical attacks on the congresswoman. Friedman argues that when Hillary Clinton wore white pantsuits, it was feminist and iconic, but when Gabbard does it, she is “using her white suits to tap into another tradition, latent in the public memory: the mythical white knight, riding in to save us all from yet another ‘regime change war.’”
It gets worse. Friedman continues that Gabbard’s white pantsuits are “the white of avenging angels and flaming swords, of somewhat combative righteousness,” and the white of “cult leaders.” Friedman writes that Gabbard’s wardrobe “has connotations of the fringe, rather than the center.”
In an (extremely) thinly-veiled dig at the congresswoman, Friedman writes, “clothes... are only as meaningful as the content that fills them.”TweetTweetWow.
If the New York Times is only “as meaningful as the content that fills” it, then based on this article, I'd imagine that the paper’s so-called "style" section is complete trash. First off, anyone with eyes can tell that, in addition to being the only combat veteran running for president, Gabbard is also the most physically beautiful and well-put-together candidate in the race. Her white pantsuits perfectly complement her complexion, and frankly, she looks stunning in them.
Any level-headed observer, whether or not he agrees with Gabbard’s politics, should be able to admit at least that much. But clearly, we are not dealing with level-headed observers at the New York Times.
Friedman seriously expects you to believe that when Clinton wore white pantsuits, it was feminist and wonderful, but now that Gabbard does it, it’s cult-like and awful. This facile argument is so unhinged as to approach self-parody. Yet frankly, it’s emblematic of the establishment’s deeply-held contempt for the congresswoman, who dares view the people’s interests as more important than the party’s.
It's one thing for people to disagree with Gabbard’s political views. But if you can’t admit that she’s rocking it in the white pantsuits, you need to open your eyes.

Soccer's AS Roma appears up for sale

Texto completo: Local investor James Pallotta's stint as owner and president of Italian soccer club AS Roma could be on the verge of a major transformation.
The club, one of Europe's most storied soccer franchises, is actively exploring either an all-out sale or at least the sale of a significant stake, according to multiple reports. On Wednesday, AS Roma's website confirmed that “preliminary talks are ongoing with some potential investors" in a “potential investment" in the franchise.
A spokesperson for Pallotta declined to comment.
Rumors of a sale or shakeup have been flying fast enough for the Italian stock exchange to halt trading of the team after exceptionally high volume drove up the stock price Wednesday.
Pallotta and a group of investors bought two-thirds of the shares of the AS Roma team, which was founded in 1927, for approximately $89 million in 2011, according to the New York Times. Pallotta became president of the team in 2012. For several years, he has said he is open to raising more equity in the team.
According to Rome newspaper Il Tempo via RomaPress, Pallotta has let it be known, on an informal basis, that he values the team at more than $1 billion, with much of the value contained in an oft-delayed new stadium project that he has been trying to make a reality since 2012.
The Houston-based Friedkin Group is the investment group believed to be seeking a significant portion of Roma shares.
According to Il Tempo, Goldman Sachs has been assisting sale efforts with international buyers, including a document promoting the team, “AS Roma Opportunity Overview: Unique opportunity to own and control an iconic Italian football club, located in one of the world's most attractive markets and offering tangible opportunities for meaningful value creation."
Raised in the North End, with a bachelor's degree from the University of Massachusetts and an MBA from Northeastern, Pallotta made his fortune in the investment world, first with the Essex and Tudor firms before founding the Raptor Group.
Pallotta was in the group of buyers that purchased the Celtics in 2002.
In the 2018-19 season, AS Roma finished in sixth place in Italy's top Serie A league with an 18-8-12 record and reached the Round of 16 in the Champions League. A year earlier, Roma reached the semifinals of the Champions League
This season, AS Roma is again in sixth place with a 6-2-4 record.
The last time the team won a Serie A title was in 2000-01.
In a lengthy and colorfully worded letter to Roma fans this past May that was posted to its website, Pallotta addressed a number of complaints and controversies that swirled around his team before coming to the issue of selling the team.
“It's obvious to me that there are certain people who are unhappy that they can't manipulate, blackmail or berate me enough to get me to sell the team," he wrote. “I understand the history of almost 3,000 years of Rome and I know how this works. If people think they're going to drive me out, it's just not going to happen."

To Help the Planet, Choose Your Tech Wisely

Texto completo: One way to help the planet is not to buy new tech, especially stuff the planet never needed, says Kendra Pierre-Louis, who reports on the environment.
How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Kendra Pierre-Louis, who covers the environment and climate, discussed the tech she's using.
Kendra, what tech tools are most important for doing your work?
I use the standard suite of office software, from Google Docs to Office, depending on my specific needs. (Docs is better when it comes to edit trace, but I prefer Excel for certain things.)
I also use Tabula a lot to scrape data out of PDFs, and the Hemingway app to make sure that what I wrote is at least somewhat understandable. I appreciate the app's color coding of things as diverse as complex sentences and passive voice.
For recording interviews, I use an external recorder because I don't trust phone recording apps -- I want to see that the device is actually recording. If it's a phone call (or a Skype call), I'll use it with a pickup microphone. I've had my setup for about five years, which is a pretty good run.
You recently wrote about buying clothes that last . Is there a method to buying tech that lasts?
Tech has a tremendous footprint. One estimate by the Lawrence Berkeley Lab said it took 70 billion kilowatt-hours in 2014, or nearly 2 percent of the total electricity generation in the United States that year, just to run the internet.
And then, of course, there are the materials used to create tech. The lithium-ion batteries that are in so many things, like my smartwatch, my cellphone and your earbuds, typically contain cobalt, which was potentially mined in the Democratic Republic of Congo using forced child labor and in conditions that hurt both people's health and the environment.
Many companies will say their phones are recyclable, but even when they are recycled (and that process can be incredibly environmentally polluting as well), the metal is generally too low a grade to go into a new phone. All of which, yes, points to a need for tech that lasts.
I don't know if there's a method as detailed as the one I laid out in my article on clothes. I can say I tend to hold on to electronics for years -- I once had a laptop that lasted nine years. Toward the end, people teased me about it because it was, physically speaking, a brick. I got my workout carrying that thing around.
Part of the reason it lasted so long was that I bought a machine that was faster, had a larger hard drive and could expand its memory more than I needed. So as software and the internet evolved to require more memory and higher processor speeds, the computer could handle it.
Also, I really took care of it. Every couple of years, I had tech repair shops clean its insides to remove the dust that built up inside. You can also do this yourself, but I liked having a professional do it for me.
And part of it is that the machine itself was well constructed, which I learned the hard way when I dumped an entire bowl of basil chicken on the keyboard. In most current laptops, that would immediately fry the computer, but the way that computer was constructed I only fried the keyboard. Replacing the keyboard only cost me $ 40 and the computer lasted another three years.
The secret is buying tech that really fits your uses, looking at reviews like the ones on iFixit about how easy it is to repair and taking care of things once you have them. Put a case on your phone. For my current phone, which is too big for me to use in one hand because most phones are designed for men's hands, which tend to be larger, I got a PopSocket to make it less likely that I will drop it.
What does your eco-conscious tech setup look like at home?
I think the greenest things I do are the things that I don't buy, honestly.
What tech trends or products are the least sustainable?
The products that are the least sustainable are the ones that don't, objectively, need to exist.
I try to tread lightly here because I'm aware that some products that leave me scratching my head can be for people with physical disabilities or mobility issues. Maybe that's the reason behind, say, motion-detecting garbage cans, which I acknowledge are cool.
But even if that really is a mobility need, does it have to be connected to the internet so it can reorder its own garbage bags?
When I think about the tremendous resources devoted to just that, it shocks me. Amazon has since canceled the Dash buttons, but each button had a full circuit board inside it, and the company has said it sold millions. Think of millions of circuit boards -- the oil converted into plastic, the ore mined and the electricity used to turn that into metal for the circuits just so you won't forget to order laundry detergent.
Does the world need a smart water bottle, or can you just set a reminder on your phone to drink water?
You've started tracking your sleep. What have you done with the data? Has sleep tracking been helpful ?
It's less that I have sleep problems and more that I have a bad habit of neglecting sleep and then wondering why I'm so exhausted. It's a common malady of modern life.
At the same time, I know how important sleep is. Matthew Walker, a neuroscientist at the University of California, Berkeley, has this expression, "The shorter you sleep, the shorter your life," so for the past year and a half I've been trying to get better about allocating enough sleep.
To that end, I have the dumbest smartwatch on the planet. It doesn't have a GPS tracker, for example, and it has a standard watch face so almost nobody suspects it's a smartwatch. I thought a really long time about whether I really needed it, but I've had it for just under two years and just replaced the watchband, so I don't feel bad about it. I can send it back to the manufacturer to swap out the battery when it dies.
I don't care at all about the sleep breakdowns like deep sleep versus R.E.M. sleep, which most research says are flawed and may be especially flawed for people with dark skin. I just care about total sleep. I try to use the data to make my sleep routine, and make sure that my weekly averages are decent.

Texto completo: The 2020 presidential field is saturated with candidates decrying wealth inequality and making the argument to soak the rich. One front-runner, for instance, is constantly denouncing "the millionaires and the billionaires." Ominously, a New York Times poll found that two-thirds of Americans believe that "wealth in this country should be more evenly distributed among more people."
Now, it is true that, in America, the top 1% owns 42% of the wealth, and the top 0.1% owns as much as the bottom 90%, so it's easy to see how many Americans don't think capitalism is working for them. Relative to those "millionaires and billionaires," plenty of people think they are getting crumbs, while others are taking big slices of the pie.
But is "income equality" the best measure of progress or prosperity?
Consider choosing between the following two actual countries. Country A has much more inequality than Country B. On the Gini measure of inequality where 0 indicates perfect equality and 100 perfect inequality Country A has a Gini index of 45 (the 103rd least-equal country) and Country B has a Gini index of 26 (among the top-ten most equal countries).
In Country A, the gross domestic product (GDP) per capita is $62,000, while in Country B, the GDP per capita is $5,700. In Country A, income in the highest quintile averages $143,000 and in the lowest quintile $15,500. In Country B, income in the highest quintile averages $10,300 and in the lowest quintile $2,900.
Country A describes the United States, and Country B describes the far more equal former Soviet state of Belarus. While everyone in Belarus is relatively much more equal, they are certainly not better off. In fact, relative to the rest of the world, the citizens of Belarus are for the most part, much poorer.
Rejecting income or wealth egalitarianism does not imply rejecting equal rights, equal treatment, or equal access to opportunity, and it does not imply that some people are judged as morally inferior. Society cannot mandate that everyone have equal height, weight, eye color, hair color, or religion, but society should not mandate that everyone make the same economic choices or be in the same economic situation, either. Even if society were to comprise otherwise-identical people who simply have different goals, we should not expect all people to have the same amount of income or wealth at all times.
One of the biggest problems with egalitarianism is it negatively judges people getting richer at different rates, even if everyone in society is getting richer in the process. Furthermore, it negatively judges the fact that every person starts with less and becomes richer throughout his lifetime
Most measures of inequality, such as the Gini coefficient, are snapshots of what people in society have in any given year and do not track what individuals have over their lives. And most of the talk about the top 1% implies that the people in the top 1% remain there. This may have been true in feudalism, where one's title determined income, but in a market economy most people's income and wealth change, typically moving upward, over their lifetimes.
By focusing on relative rather than absolute levels of income or wealth, egalitarianism mandates policies that can make everyone poorer as a result. Rather than looking down on increases in income and wealth in differing amounts, we should celebrate and be grateful for the efforts of those who work for the benefit of all. After all, we collectively are choosing, freely, where to spend our hard-earned money. The only entity forcing open our pocketbooks is ironically the same one politicians want to use to increase so-called equality - the government.

Texto completo: It is almost automatic when watching a baseball game on television to hear the announcer say, 'If you're keeping score at home,' after one or several plays that take place over the course of a game. Well, if you're the person keeping score at home or anywhere else, an interesting play just occurred in the game of Washington versus President Trump or anyone else in his orbit.
Last week, after months of political theater including Congressional testimony and a protracted court case, Trump confidant and long-time K Street player, Roger Stone, was convicted of lying to Congress along with a number of other charges. Evidence against Stone showed that he had passed along scores of emails stolen by Russia from Democratic Party com- puters and funneled through WikiLeaks.
Stone, prosecutors alleged, shared everything that passed through his hands via WikiLeaks with the Trump campaign. While Stone denied it, with mountains of evidence to the contrary, prosecutors showed that he had.
Stone's conviction brings to six the number of major players close to the President, who have either been sentenced to prison or await sentencing for various crimes including lying to Congress or federal investigators. Stone was allowed to remain free while a judge determines his sentence. He could face up to 50 years, though it would be shocking if he got more than ten, say court watchers.
While Washington is the epicenter of this legal opera, in Denver a well-known local attorney and talk radio personality joined in this orbiting chaos over the weekend. Craig Silverman, once Denver's chief deputy DA, somehow got himself fired mid-show for discussing Trump and the impeachment inquiry. Firings in radio-including many that defy good taste and imagination-happen all the time. But to get the hook mid-show turned a personnel issue into more of a 'man-bites-dog' vignette.
"So does it have to do with Donald Trump? I think so," Silverman told News4. "I wanted to talk about the impeachment inquiry and a lot of these facts are very damning against Donald Trump." And certainly, none more damning than the aforementioned Stone, who has been a friend of Trump's for decades.
Before the plug got pulled, Silverman said he had been talking about Roger Stone and the nexus between Stone and long-ago Trump attorney and notorious mean guy, Roy Cohn. But instead of letting the talk continue, someone interrupted programming with a newsfeed and, like that, Silverman's career with Salem went up in a puff of air.
Salem Media Group, which owns KNUS-AM along with a cluster of radio operations across the country and bills itself as "family-themed" with "conservative values," denies the veteran Denver legal eagle's accusation. The conglomerate says that Silverman was plugging an appearance on another show, one with his friend and former talk show partner, Dan Caplis. In radio world, that's a no-no. In denying Silverman's charges, KNUS management says that it may be all a misunderstanding and that Silverman is welcome to return to his old time slot next weekend.
The Silverman-KNUS spat only adds to the drama playing out daily at the White House with President Trump at the center. Within hours of the Denver radio daze fiasco, the story was picked up by The New York Times, The Washington Post, AP, and more. Silverman has already made appearances on MSNBC, including Morning Joe and is scheduled to appear on CNN's Don Lemon show.
Stone's conviction in federal court takes him into dubious company, all associated with the President. Michael Flynn, who was Trump's National Security Advisor for less than 20 days, awaits sentencing. He plead guilty to lying to the FBI. Ex-Trump campaign executive, Rick Gates, has also entered a guilty plea for lying to the FBI. He has been a cooperative government witness. He is to be sentenced late this year or early in January.
Paul Manafort, who once served as the President's campaign chairman, is now serving a federal prison sentence for conspiracy against the U.S., tax evasion, bank fraud, hiding foreign bank accounts and conspiracy to obstruct justice. Trump's former attorney, Michael Cohen, is now serving a three-year sentence for lying to Congress. George Papadopoulos, a foreign policy advisor in the campaign but guy Trump once referred to as a 'coffee boy,' served two weeks in prison for lying to the FBI.
While it may not have been a good week for Stone and it certainly wasn't what Silverman imagined, it turned into a pretty good week for a U.S. Army commando preparing to stand trial for killings of Afghanistan civilians who got a presidential pardon from Trump. Another former Army lieutenant convicted of murder for ordering his men to fire on three Afghansilling two-was also pardoned by the President last Friday.
The President, who has been known to telegraph his pardons-as was the case with former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio-has given no hint if he'll pardon any of his former aides or friends. But it has been speculated that Flynn and Stone may be in line for one.'

Roger Stone declarado culpable ... ¿y qué sigue?
WikiLeaks con la campaña de Trump. Mientras Stone lo negó, con montañas de evidencias acerca de lo contrario, los fiscales mostraron que sí.
La condena de Stone eleva a seis el número de jugadores importantes cercanos al Presidente, quienes han sido sentenciados a prisión o están a la espera de ser sentenciados por varios delitos incluyendo mentir al Congreso o a investigadores federales. Se le permitió a Stone permanecer libre mientras un juez determinaba su sentencia. Podría enfrentar hasta 50 años, aunque sorprendería si tuviera más de diez, decían los observadores de la corte.
Si bien Washington es el epicentro de esta ópera legal, en Denver un conocido abogado local y personalidad de la radio se unió en este caos en órbita durante el fin de semana. Craig Silverman, una vez diputado del Fiscal del Distrito de Denver, de alguna manera fue despedido a mitad del show por discutir sobre Trump y la investigación del juicio político. Los disparos en la radio-incluyendo muchos que desafian el buen gusto y la imaginacion, suceden todo el tiempo. Pero tener la medida a mediados del espectáculo convirtió un problema personal en más de una viñetas de 'hombre-mordeduras de perro'.
"Entonces ¿tiene que ver esto con Donald Trump? Creo que sí", dijo Silverman a News4. "Quería hablar sobre las condenas contra Donald Trump". Y ciertamente, no más condenatorio que la persona mencionada, Stone, que ha sido amigo de Trump durante décadas. La investigación de la acusación y muchos de estos hechos son muy
Antes de que se desconectara, Silverman dijo que había estado hablando de Roger Stone y el nexo entre Stone y el antiguo abogado de Trump y el famoso chico malo Roy Cohn. Pero en lugar de dejar que la conversación continuara, alguien interrumpió la programación con una fuente de noticias y, de esa manera, la carrera de Silverman con Salem se fue en un soplo de aire.
Salem Media Group, que posee KNUS-AM junto a un grupo de operaciones de radio en todo el país y se autodenomina como "temática familiar" con "valores conservadores", niega la acusación del veterano legal de Denver. El conglomerado dice que Silverman estaba precentando la aparición en otro programa, uno con su amigo y periodista radial, Dan Caplis. En el mundo de la radio, eso es un no-no. Al negar los cargos de Silverman, los directores de KNUS dicen que todo puede ser un malentendido y que Silverman puede regresar a su antiguo horario el próximo fin de semana.
La pelea de Silverman-KNUS solamente se añade al drama que se presenta diariamente en la Casa Blanca con el presidente Trump en su centro. En cuestión de horas de fiasco de la Radio de Denver, la historia fue recogida por el The New York Times, El Washington Post, AP, y otros más. Silverman ya se ha presentado en MSNBC, incluyendo a Morning Joe y está programado para presentarse en CNN, en el Don Lemon show.
La condena de Stone en la corte federal lo pone en una compañía dudosa, todos asociados con el Presidente. Michael Flynn, que fue asesor de seguridad nacional de Trump durante menos de 20 días, espera sentencia. Se declaró culpable de mentirle al FBI. El ex ejecutivo de campaña de Trump, Rick Gates, también se declaró culpable por mentir al FBI. Ha sido testigo cooperativo del gobierno. Será sentenciado a finales de este año o principios de enero.
Paul Manafort, quien fue antes jefe de la campaña del Presidente, esta ya pagando su condena por conspirar en contra de EE.UU., evasión de impuestos, fraude bancario, escondiendo cuentas bancarias en el extranjero y conspirado en obstruir la justicia. El ex abogado de Trump, Michael Cohen, está prestando una sentencia de tres años por mentir al Congreso. George Papadopoulos, un consejero de política extranjera durante la campaña pero alguien de quien Trump dijo antes que era un 'coffee boy,' pasó dos años de cárcel por mentirle al FBI.
Aun cuando esta no puede ser una buena semana para Stone y que ciertamente no era lo que Silverman se imaginaba, termino siendo una buena semana para el U.S. Army comando que se prepara para asesinatos de gente civil en Afganistán y que recibió un perdón presidencial de parte de Trump. Otro teniente del ejército convicto de asesinato al ordenar a sus hombres dispararle a tres afganos-matando a dos-también fue perdonado por el presidente el viernes pasado.
El Presidente, que ha sido conocido por telegrafiar sus perdones-como fue el caso de antiguo sheriff del condado de Maricopa, Joe Arpaio-no ha dicho si el va a perdonar algunos de sus antiguos ayudantes o amigos. Pero se ha especulado si Flynn y Stone pueden estar en la lista de uno de ellos.

Texto completo: We have known for some time now that China is carrying out something deeply unsettling in Xinjiang. The restive, far west region of the country is home to a number of Turkic Muslim minorities, including the Uighurs, who in the last half-decade have been swept up in large numbers by the dragnet of the central state. We know that roughly a million or more people have been subjected to a vast system of detention or "reeducation" camps, where they are cajoled to "Sinicize" and abandon their native Islamic traditions. There's already been a great deal of international criticism: In Washington, both Republican and Democratic lawmakers have condemned China's project of de facto cultural genocide. A report by a United Nations panel of experts warned this month that China's methods could "deeply erode the foundations" of Chinese society.
But Chinese officials still hide behind the Potemkin villages of their own making. They insist that the camps are actually job-training centers where amenable Xinjiang residents are working to better assimilate into mainstream society through vocational schooling and language instruction. They point to the necessity of such measures to counter the reach of radical Islamist groups in the region. We know now, though, that Chinese authorities don't actually believe their own party line.
That's because of the new details surfaced by an astonishing set of leaked documents obtained by the New York Times. The cache includes 403 pages of Communist Party directives, reports, notes from internal investigations and internal speeches given by party officials, including President Xi Jinping. The Times's story by Austin Ramzy and Chris Buckley, published this weekend, offers a rarely seen window into the deliberations of one of the world's most opaque governments. And what we see is chilling.
It relays how a flurry of ethnic violence and terrorist attacks in the early part of the decade persuaded Xi to unleash the "organs of dictatorship" - his own words, in a private speech. This apparently involved mass roundups, the construction of a 21st-century Orwellian apparatus of control and surveillance and a systematic assault on the ability of the region's residents to observe their Islamic faith. As a justification for the draconian clampdown, a top Chinese official in Xinjiang warned of the risks of placing "human rights above security" in a 10-page directive from 2017. The tranche of documents also points to internal disagreement about the repression in the region and was delivered to the Times by a figure from "the Chinese political establishment" who "expressed hope that their disclosure would prevent party leaders, including Xi, from escaping culpability for the mass detentions."
Perhaps the most striking document is a classified directive issued to local officials in an eastern Xinjiang city on how to talk to Uighur students who return from other parts of China and discover their relatives and friends have been disappeared into detention camps.
They were instructed to tell the students that their relatives had been "infected by unhealthy thoughts," framing the state's distrust of Muslim minorities in terrifyingly clinical terms. "Freedom is only possible when this 'virus' in their thinking is eradicated and they are in good health," read the directive.
The Times also reported on evidence of what appears to be a "scoring system" used by officials to determine who gets released from a camp. It incorporates not only the behavior of the detainees, but also the cooperation of relatives outside. "Family members, including you, must abide by the state's laws and rules, and not believe or spread rumors," officials were told to say. "Only then can you add points for your family member, and after a period of assessment they can leave the school if they meet course completion standards."
The new revelations fit into a wider, horrifying story of repression. China makes independent reporting in Xinjiang virtually impossible - and every foreign reporter invested in covering the story has to weigh the risk of endangering local fixers and sources, many of whom may have already been swept into detention. Meanwhile, analysis of satellite imagery led one researcher to conclude that the authorities have demolished 10,000 to 15,000 religious sites in Xinjiang in recent years. The Washington Post's editorial page director Fred Hiatt declared: "In China, every day is Kristallnacht."
A Washington Post report looked at the plight of one Uighur woman, Zumrat Dawut, who spent more than two months in a cell that was so cramped that the women there had to lie down in shifts. During the day, they recited propaganda slogans that included praise for Xi.
"When she was let go, she was forced to sign documents agreeing not to practice her religion and not to tell anyone what had happened in the camps," my colleagues Emily Rauhala and Anna Fifield wrote. "After her detention, she was forced to pay a fine of more than $2,500 for breaking China's family planning rules by having three, not two, children."
Terrified by what would happen if she resisted, she complied with a suggestion to submit herself for a sterilization. Dawut, unlike countless of her brethren, managed to escape the country alongside her children and Pakistani husband and made her way to the United States, where she's hoping to receive asylum. Her troubles captured the attention of U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who cited her as a victim of religious persecution.
But Washington's focus on the horrors in Xinjiang also comes at a time when the Trump administration has made it dramatically harder for refugees and asylum seekers to find sanctuary in the United States. Locked in a trade war with Beijing, President Trump has remained conspicuously silent on pressing matters of human rights, both in Xinjiang and Hong Kong. And, indeed, the protesters in Hong Kong, where clashes with police are turning all the more violent, see China's unrelenting, unflinching approach taken in Xinjiang as an omen of darker days to come under Beijing rule.

Texto completo: Shrimp and grits are a cozy meal that can feed a crowd, but it can take a while to cook each element, especially if you’re not accustomed to cooking (and stirring) grits that are cooking on a stove.
Melissa Clark, the New York Times columnist and author of several best-selling cookbooks, knows that a multi-cooker will make quick work of just about any comfort food, which was the focus of her 2018 book, “Comfort in an Instant.”
This recipe is a good example of how you can cook multiple elements of a dish in an Instant Pot at the same time by taking advantage of the wire racks that come with them. By sauteing aromatics and tomatoes in the bottom of the pot and placing a bowl of grits on top, you can keep the grits and the tomato bacon mixture separate until serving. The shrimp cook so quickly that you won’t cook them under pressure, but instead, you’ll cook them in the tomato mixture after the sauce and grits have cooked under pressure.
Unless you have a really small multicooker, you should be able to double this recipe without trouble, as long as you can find a bowl that fits inside the bowl and holds the grits.
SHRIMP AND GRITS WITH BACON AND CHEDDAR
• 1 [1/2] pounds peeled and deveined large shrimp
• 1 [1/2] tablespoons Old Bay seasoning
• 2 slices smoked bacon, diced
• 1 small onion, diced
•1 small red bell pepper, diced
• 1 jalapeño, seeded (if desired) and diced
•2 garlic cloves, thinly sliced
•1 14.5-ounce can diced tomatoes
•3/4 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more if needed
• [1/2] cup old-fashioned or stone-ground grits
• 1 cup whole milk
• 3/4 cup shredded cheddar cheese (3 ounces)
• 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
• [1/2] tablespoon fresh lemon juice
• Sliced scallions, for serving
• Hot sauce and/or lemon wedges, for serving
In a large bowl, combine the shrimp and Old Bay seasoning. Cover and let marinate at room temperature while you prepare the remaining ingredients.
Using the sauté function, scatter the bacon into the pressure cooker pot and cook, stirring frequently, until browned and the fat has rendered, 10 to 12 minutes. Leaving the fat in the pan, transfer the bacon with a slotted spoon to a plate lined with paper towels.
Stir the onion, bell pepper, jalapeño and garlic into the pot. Cook until softened and translucent, about 5 minutes.
Stir in the tomatoes and [1/2] teaspoon of the salt, scraping up any browned bits on the bottom, and turn off the sauté function.
In a medium metal (not glass) bowl that fits in the pressure cooker, stir together the grits, milk, 1 cup water and remaining[1/4] teaspoon salt. If your steamer rack has handles, place the bowl on the rack and lower everything into the pressure cooker pot, setting it over the tomato mixture. If your rack does not have handles, first place the rack in the pot, then lower in the bowl using a homemade sling.
Lock the lid into place and cook on high pressure for 10 minutes. Let the pressure release naturally.
Carefully remove the bowl from the pressure cooker, using the sling or oven mitts.
Stir the cheddar and butter into the grits, adding more milk or water to reach your desired consistency. Taste and add more salt if needed.
Using the sauté function, stir the marinated shrimp and lemon juice into the tomato mixture in the pressure cooker pot and cook, stirring frequently, until the shrimp are cooked through, 3 to 5 minutes.
To serve, spoon the grits onto serving bowls and top with the shrimp and tomato mixture, reserved bacon, scallions, and hot sauce and/or lemon wedges on the side. Serves 4.

Texto completo: A couple in California is accusing a FedEx driver of throwing a package over their fence and crushing their small dog.
The dog, a four-pound Yorkshire terrier named Cooper, had to be euthanized because of his injuries. Mitchell Galin and Keiko Napier, of Venice, told KCBS-TV that Cooper was lounging in their front yard when the large package was thrown into the air and landed on the tiny pooch.
Galin said he ran to pick up the box and discovered Cooper lying in a pool of his blood.
The dog’s veterinarian said Cooper suffered lung and liver injuries. Galin and Napier decided to put the dog out of its misery.
“It was painful to watch your dog in pain,” Galin said of Cooper, who used to sleep in bed with the couple at night.
“We’ve just had a horrible weekend,” Napier added.
In a statement, FedEx said the company extends “our deepest sympathies to the family of the pet involved in this incident."
“We take this matter very seriously and are working directly with those involved to determine the circumstances behind this event,” it continued. “Based on the outcome of our investigation, we will take the appropriate action.”
The family said the apology wasn’t enough.
“To me, that’s not satisfactory,” Napier said. “I feel they need to say they’re going to institute a corporate-wide mandate that drivers cannot throw packages; that’s what I want to hear. I don’t want to hear 'we’ll look into it.'”

Michelle Goldberg: Stephen Miller is a white nationalist. Does it matter?

Texto completo: In August 2018, Darren Beattie, a White House speechwriter and policy aide, was fired after CNN revealed that he’d spoken at a 2016 conference alongside several white nationalists, including contributors to the website VDARE. Later that month, Ian M. Smith, a policy analyst working on immigration at the Department of Homeland Security, resigned after The Atlantic obtained leaked emails linking him to white nationalists.
We’re about to find out how far the already impossibly low standards to which we hold the Trump administration have fallen since then. Last week, the Southern Poverty Law Center published evidence of the white nationalism of Stephen Miller, President Donald Trump’s senior immigration adviser. The SPLC obtained more than 900 emails from 2015 and 2016 that Miller, who was then an aide to Sen. Jeff Sessions, sent to editors at the far-right website Breitbart to shape its coverage of race and immigration. The group got the emails from Katie McHugh, a former Breitbart editor who, after being fired for anti-Muslim tweets, moved even further right before renouncing racism. The emails show that Miller was steeped in white nationalism before he joined the White House, where he’s had the opportunity to put his racist views into practice.
McHugh told the SPLC that her bosses introduced her to Miller so that he could help guide the site’s reporting. Miller forwarded her articles from sites like VDARE — named for Virginia Dare, the first English child born in North America — and Alex Jones’ Infowars. Miller sent McHugh information about “immigrant crime” and offered her talking points on defending Confederate iconography in the wake of white nationalist Dylann Roof’s massacre of black churchgoers in Charleston, South Carolina.
In one email, Miller recommended that Breitbart draw parallels between Pope Francis’ 2015 speech before Congress, in which he called on America to welcome immigrants, and the wildly racist 1973 novel “The Camp of the Saints,” in which weak-minded leftists allow soulless brown hordes to conquer the white world. Breitbart published just such a piece a few weeks later, quoting the novel’s disparagement of the decadent West’s aversion to genocide: “With France the Enlightened glad to grovel on her knees, no government now will dare sign its name to the genocidal deed.”
The question now is whether any of this can be made to matter. Miller’s aversion to nonwhite immigrants, after all, is hardly a secret — it’s why he has his job in the first place. He’s been pushing white nationalist policies for three years, championing the Muslim ban and the sadistic policy of family separation and encouraging Trump to slash refugee admissions. In an email to McHugh, Miller argued against Mexican hurricane victims receiving temporary protected status, a provision protecting people displaced by natural disasters and wars from deportation. (“TPS is everything,” he wrote.) Now he’s a leading figure in an administration that has tried to yank temporary protected status from more than 300,000 people. Meanwhile, he reportedly worked on a plan with Gordon Sondland, Trump’s hackish ambassador to the European Union, to encourage more immigration from Europe. The Washington Post reported that some of his own co-workers believe he holds racist views, though he insisted otherwise.
So it’s not a shock to learn about the roots of Miller’s ideology. There’s a difference, however, between knowing something and proving it. “The evidence is incontrovertible,” Jonathan Greenblatt, head of the Anti-Defamation League, told me of Miller’s white nationalist associations. “It’s no longer speculation. It’s now been substantiated.” He said bluntly: “Stephen Miller must resign.”
Earlier this year, when Rep. Ilhan Omar called Miller a white nationalist, powerful figures on the right slammed her as an anti-Semite because Miller is Jewish. A White House official tried to reprise this defense last week, but no one is buying it.
Though the revelations about Miller aren’t surprising, it’s important that they not be swept away by the torrent of other news, lest we admit that even the degraded standards of 2018 no longer apply. “This is a smoking gun,” said Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who has been leading the call for Miller’s resignation in Congress, adding, “We didn’t know this, because if we did, we would have demanded his resignation much earlier, and in a much more forceful way.”
Trump is, of course, unlikely to jettison his xenophobic homunculus. “Stephen is not going anywhere,” a senior White House official told The Daily Beast last week. “The president has his back.” But the pressure on Trump, and, perhaps more important, on his supporters in Congress, is only going to build.
Many elected Republicans justify their fealty to Trump by denying the white nationalist character of his administration. When the president does things that make that impossible — say, by praising racist marchers in Charlottesville or telling congresswomen of color to go back to their countries — it can force members of his party to either condemn him or condone racism.
On Monday, a coalition of civil rights organizations including the ADL, the NAACP and United We Dream sent a letter to the White House demanding Miller’s removal, writing, “Supporters of white supremacists and neo-Nazis should not be allowed to serve at any level of government.” Ocasio-Cortez sees a possibility for protests. “It’s really just a matter of sticking to it and not allowing this to fall out of the media cycle,” she said. “This is something that I personally am committed to. This is a really big deal.” I hope she’s right. If she’s not, it will show us how much hate we’ve learned to tolerate.

Blackout cake is a knockout for chocolate fans

Texto completo: Winning Recipes

Growing up, everyone in our family looked forward to Sunday dinner, and the dessert finale was always the highlight for us kids.

All of the aunts, uncles and cousins came from miles around just to be together at Moms table. I fondly remember my Aunt Maries homemade blackout cake as the hit of our Sunday dessert table. Although the cake was fabulous and very rich, it was always a little lopsided. We found out years later why: My Aunt Marie would cut a tiny sliver of cake to taste it, and then push the cake together so no one would know a piece was missing.

This rich, intensely chocolate cake was inspired by the original Ebingers blackout cake, a puddinglike cake that had a cult following among Brooklynites. Ebinger Baking Co. opened its first location in 1898 on Flatbush Avenue in Brooklyn. The single storefront grew to a baking empire with more than 50 locations around Brooklyn and Queens.

According to a 1969 New York Times article, the blackout cake was named during World War II, when blackout drills were performed in homes around the borough to avoid silhouetting battleships leaving the Brooklyn Navy Yard. Long gone by 1972, Ebingers bakery inspired so many versions of their famous blackout cake.

My Aunt Maries version was created from her love of chocolate and to mimic the original blackout cake. Neither the original Ebingers nor my aunts recipes were ever given out, but I created this recipe from my memories of enjoying a slice of both versions. I have named the cake after my hilarious Aunt Marie. My son calls this a puddin cake and that would be a perfectly Southern name for a Northern dessert.

Be sure to refrigerate the filling at least until it is firm, preferably overnight. It is best to bake the layers and make the pudding the day before serving, so plan ahead if possible. Assemble the cake and refrigerate a few hours before serving, as this cake tastes best cold from the refrigerator.

Texto completo: Pete Buttigieg had kind words for the Tea Party in 2010, and it isn’t going over well with some 2020 Democratic voters.
The South Bend, Indiana, mayor spoke to a Tea Party-affiliated group called Citizens for Common Sense while running for Indiana state treasurer nine years ago. In the speech, he acknowledged that some found it odd that he would speak to the group as a Democrat.
“I have to admit, as a Democrat, that many of my friends and supporters looked at me as if I was absolutely nuts when I suggested that I would be coming tonight to speak with a group that’s often identified with the Tea Party,” Buttigieg told the room.
He added, “There are some, especially in my party, who think the Tea Party’s a wholly owned subsidiary of the Republican Party. But there are many others who believe that the Tea Party’s motivated by real concerns about the direction of our government and the responses of our government to citizens.”iFrame Object Footage of Buttigieg’s 2010 comments, described in a recent New York Times report on the candidate, resurfaced this week and sparked outrage with some on the Left.Tweet Tweet Tweet Other 2020 Democratic campaigns used Buttigieg’s statements against him too. Sawyer Hackett, the national press secretary for Julian Castro’s presidential bid, tweeted out the clip hoping to highlight Buttigieg’s remarks. Tweet Sean Savett, Buttigieg’s rapid response communications director, pushed back on those criticizing his candidate’s remarks Monday night by noting that 2020 front-runner and former Vice President Joe Biden had made similar statements during the height of the Tea Party, as did President Barack Obama.Tweet Buttigieg, 37, has been climbing in the polls in recent weeks. He topped the latest poll from the Des Moines Register in which he leads second-place candidate Elizabeth Warren by 9 points.

A triumph of truth about China’s detention camps

Texto completo: China has many prisoners of conscience but perhaps none like Wang Yongzhi. Five years ago, according to newly leaked documents, the Communist Party official was assigned the task of forcing tens of thousands of minority Uyghurs into indoctrination camps in western China. The party leaders wanted to eradicate Muslim culture and to show “absolutely no mercy” in doing so.
“Wipe them out completely,” Mr. Wang told subordinates. “Destroy them root and branch.”
But then, in a change of heart, Mr. Wang did feel mercy, especially after more than a million Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities were held in camps in Xinjiang region and mistreated.
Worried about the harm to relations between China’s Han majority and its minorities, he told others it was OK for Muslims to read the Quran and that party officials should read it to understand Uyghur culture. He quietly released more than 7,000 of the detainees. Later he was arrested and prosecuted. Since 2017, Mr. Wang’s whereabouts have been unknown.
“He refused,” one document said, “to round up everyone who should be rounded up.”
We know this story because another party official, equally courageous, secretly released 403 pages of internal party documents to The New York Times. That anonymous official was also motivated to end what is now called a cultural cleansing of Uyghurs and other Turkic Muslims. The documents give a behind-the-scenes picture of a party so fearful for its survival that it is willing to paint any group as an enemy to stay in power.
In all, at least 12,000 party members were investigated for allegedly not doing their job in this repression It remains unclear what has happened to them. Yet the fact remains that many if not most displayed a conscience about helping innocent people avoid harsh treatment in concentration camps.
More than 70 years ago, George Kennan, an American diplomat and Russia expert, wrote that the Soviet Union, whose regime he said was driven mainly by fear for its survival, would eventually weaken and collapse. His prediction was prophetic. Within the ruling Communist Party, internal dissent over evil acts helped end the Soviet empire.
China’s ruling party may be in a similar place. As it keeps cracking down on innocent groups, such as pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong, it risks having its underlying fears and its evil acts exposed by its own officials. Such courage in recognizing the right of individual conscience is what challenges the party’s motives and actions from within.  As with those 7,000 Uyghurs freed by Mr. Wang, what is right has triumphed.

Texto completo: "This is where people gather in the summer time, and it'd be very unfortunate to lose baseball in any of these communities. Our communications team is looking to keep baseball in all 160 markets."
Jeff Lantz
MiLB Senior Director of Communications
Maryland may lose two longtime minor league baseball franchises if a massive Major League Baseball proposal goes forward.
The Frederick Keys and Hagerstown Suns would be two of 42 teams that would have ties severed with MLB under a new plan to streamline its minor league system for efficiency and to improve conditions for players, according to a New York Times report. Major and Minor League Baseball's current Professional Baseball Agreement is set to expire after the 2020 season, an agreement that assures that there will be 160 minor league teams.
The proposal would drop that number down to 118 teams.
The Delmarva Shorebirds, based in Salisbury since 1996, were not named on the New York Times list. The organization has been a member of the Orioles since 1997.
In 2015, Arthur W. Perdue Stadium, home of the Shorebirds, received more than $4.25 million from the state and Wicomico County for various upgrades to the facility.
Officials from the Shorebirds, Suns and Keys were contacted Monday morning but were unable to comment on the situation. Delmarva Now was referred to MiLB Senior Director of Communications Jeff Lantz.
Lantz said the proposal was the first presented to Minor League Baseball and the sides will meet in upcoming weeks to negotiate a plan that would "save as many teams" as possible.
"From what we gathered from the MLB, they did a poll of which ballparks were better, which needed a lot of work and came up with a mass list," he said. "What exactly it is about Frederick or Hagerstown that got them put on that list, we're not sure."
Overall, among the proposed changes are plans to sever ties with 42 minor league teams, close to a quarter of the minor league teams under the current contract; and to shift the baseball draft from June to August and limit the number of rounds. Under the plan, a new "Dream League" would be operated by MLB at minimal cost and provide undrafted players an opportunity to break into professional baseball.
The Suns are an affiliate of the Washington Nationals while both the Shorebirds and Keys feed players into the Baltimore Orioles system. The Suns play against the Shorebirds in minor league baseball's Single-A South Atlantic League.
The SAL could potentially have multiple teams affected by the proposal outside of Hagerstown, including the Lexington Legends and the West Virginia Power. The Legends won the South Atlantic League championship in 2019.
Lantz said an estimated 1,200 players would also lose their jobs should the proposal be approved.
"A lot would be released and have their dreams of being big-league players crushed," Lantz said. "We'll see how things shake out. Both sides want to get a deal done that benefits baseball."
However, the 2020 season is not in jeopardy and is scheduled to be played uninterrupted, he said.
A lot of Maryland baseball history threatened Founded in 1989, the Keys play in the Carolina League, last won a division title in 2011 and have fielded players over the years such as former Orioles Nick Markakis and Manny Machado.
The organization underwent minor upgrades to Nymeo Field at Harry Grove Stadium last season, which included extended ballpark netting, the addition of a local craft brewery stand and a new warning track.
Historic Municipal Stadium, the home of the Suns, is one of the third oldest stadiums in Minor League Baseball. After renewing their contract with the Nationals, the Suns underwent several renovations, which included a new infield, updated outfield wall padding, protective netting around both dugouts, new bathrooms for fans and environmentally-friendly LED lighting throughout Municipal Stadium after the 2016 season.
The Suns have been an affiliate of the Nationals since 2007, also partnering with the Orioles, Detroit Tigers, Toronto Blue Jays, San Francisco Giants and New York Mets throughout their existence. Famous players include the Nationals' Ryan Zimmerman and former NL MVP Bryce Harper.
The Suns, Keys and Shorebirds make up half of the minor league baseball franchises in Maryland. The Bowie Baysox and Aberdeen Ironbirds have ties to the Orioles, while the Southern Maryland Blue Crabs play with the non-MiLB connected Independent League.
"This is where people gather in the summer time, and it'd be very unfortunate to lose baseball in any of these communities," Lantz said. "Our communications team is looking to keep baseball in all 160 markets."
Reaction to list of targeted teams Hagerstown is in the process of building an entirely new stadium.
The town has completed a phase one market feasibility and site selection study. It has also funded and is now beginning a phase two study which is a deep look into the geology and geography of the site. So far, it has poured about $36,000 on initial study and phase two study will cost about $300,000.
Dan Speddan, president of Visit Hagerstown, the Hagerstown Visitor Center, said even if the team's facility is not the most updated, the potential impact to the loss of the Suns is major.
"Even at that, they are the number one tourist attraction to the city of Hagerstown," he said. "If we lose the Suns, it's about a $3.5 million to $5 million negative economic impact."
The new proposal threatens not only stadium funding, but the grow of the Washington County town.
"Talk of contraction could be damaging to our stadium effort if we don't come up with good contingency plans ..." Speddan said. "We plan to go forward with this but we're going to make sure we have a contingency plan so if things go bad with minor league baseball we still have a presence, a tenant, you know, and we still have a really good entertainment venue in our downtown."
Speddan also mentioned the jobs that could be lost as well.
"There would be about six career positions lost and probably 45 to 55 summer jobs that would just disappear," he said.
"This was the catalyst project that was going to turn our city's core around," he said. "So you can see what we would lose if this all came to a halt. It's not just baseball and summer jobs and the economy, but entire downtown revitalization depends on this ballpark development."
Fans took to social media on Monday to express their displeasure with the proposal and the potential fate of the Keys and Suns.
A Twitter user with the handle @kjshay44 wrote, "Watching the Frederick Keys and Hagerstown Suns are great experiences. You get closer to the action. You see rising stars. Those towns love these teams. Don't do this (MLB)..."
Another user named Michael Schneider wrote, "The Keys have led the (Carolina League) in attendance 7 out of the last 8 years. Many hard working people will lose their job. Having a minor league team is a big part of Frederick."
"If (the) MLB is successful in its minor league proposal and kills off the Frederick Keys, I will never again watch a MLB game....," wrote Harvey Morrell.
Victoria E. Freile of the Rochester Democrat and Chronicle contributed to this report.
"This is where people gather in the summer time, and it'd be very unfortunate to lose baseball in any of these communities. Our communications team is looking to keep baseball in all 160 markets."

Texto completo: The best TV shows introduce us to new worlds and reveal something about our own. That's definitely true of "Euphoria," "Modern Love," "The Morning Show" and "Watchmen," four of this year's most interesting new shows. On the surface, the series -- about troubled teens, people in love, workers in the age of #MeToo and masked heroes, respectively -- could not be more different, but on a deeper level, they all seek to help us better understand and empathize with one another, overcome collective and personal trauma and find connections.

'Watchmen' HBO

Creator Damon Lindelof ("Lost," "The Leftovers") takes a fresh look at "Watchmen" with what he calls a "remix" of the beloved mid-1980s comic book series of the same name. Set in an alternate version of present-day America, in which Robert Redford is president, Lindelof's "Watchmen" trades the original's Cold War concerns for issues of race and white supremacy, following Angela Abar (Regina King), a Tulsa, Okla., police detective who doubles as the masked, leather-nun-outfitted, butt-kicking Sister Night, as she investigates the murder of her friend and colleague Police Chief Judd Crawford (Don Johnson), who, she learns, may have been a member of the KKK-like Seventh Kavalry.
The reviews: The New York Times' James Poniewozik celebrates "Watchmen" as "a first-class entertainment out of the box, immediately creating a sad and wondrous retro-futuristic world." "Is ... 'Watchmen' thrilling? Abundantly. Funny? Riotously. Inventive and surprising? Like a magician with a thousand hats and rabbits," Poniewozik writes. Emily Todd VanDerWerff of Vox is equally enthusiastic, saying the show left her "dizzy from its audacity, its delight, and its occasional lack of taste."
The scoop: Lindelof recalls that, as a kid, he loved that the "Watchmen" comic-book series was "political and cultural, and a story about America unvarnished," with conflicts that echoed real-world events and made him feel "anxious and uncomfortable" yet "exhilarated." So in reframing the story for 2019, with the Cold War no longer a central concern, he says, he asked himself, "What makes me uncomfortable now? What is the great American anxiety? What is the thing we're not talking about but are all thinking may be our destruction, both morally and physiologically?" It was soon after the Charlottesville conflict and Lindelof had just read Ta-Nehisi Coates' essay "The Case for Reparations." "The answer," he says, "was race."

'Euphoria' HBO
Zendaya, as 17-year-old recovering drug addict Rue, leads a stellar ensemble cast (including Hunter Schafer, as Rue's best friend, Jules) in this raw, riveting series about high school students toggling between isolation and connection as they navigate a world rife with sex, drugs and violence and complicated by social media. Inspired by an Israeli show of the same name and faithful to its spirit, creator Sam Levinson ("Assassination Nation") nevertheless started essentially from scratch in crafting this heart-rending, sometimes terrifying, dramatic series, basing much of it on his own struggles with addiction and getting clean.
The reviews: Variety's Caroline Framke says "Euphoria," while neither "an easy watch, nor a particularly pleasant one," nevertheless "has an undeniable pull that makes it too intriguing to ignore." Wired's Jason Parham says the show's "choice to skid easy definitions around difficult topics is what makes it an important cultural engine of our time." However, while praising Rue and Jules' relationship as a "jewel" that will keep her watching, the New Yorker's Doreen St. Felix dismissed early episodes as "a highly self-conscious study of ennui, overfull with fancy camera tricks and thousand-dollar designer getups."
The scoop: Levinson says he sought to convey how "we are all shaped by the little and big traumas" in our lives and to surprise audiences with the characters' "depth" and "humanity." "A staple of being young is not quite understanding how deep other people's emotional lives are," he says. "I wanted the show to mimic that experience." He aimed to reflect a broader human experience as well. "We're all trying to navigate the world as best we can, and empathizing with that can bring us closer," he adds. "The core idea behind the show is to have respect for the inner lives of the people around us."

'Modern Love' Amazon
Each episode of this charming series draws from a real-life story of love, romantic or otherwise, shared in the New York Times' popular column Modern Love. In the first season, we meet, among others, a book reviewer (played by Cristin Milioti) whose relationships are overseen by her unexpectedly insightful doorman (Laurentiu Possa); a middle-aged actor and his wife (John Slattery and Tina Fey) who return from the brink of divorce thanks to therapy and tennis; and a bipolar lawyer (Anne Hathaway) struggling to connect in the midst of her illness. The series, featuring an all-star cast, is a love letter to love and, often, New York City.
The reviews: The Hollywood Reporter's Tim Goodman calls the show "a simple idea executed well," "a little gem" and "compelling television." "Almost all the choices in 'Modern Love' are the right ones," he writes. The Atlantic's Shirley Li is less impressed. "'Modern Love' had the chance to build upon the Times' original essays," she contends, "but to its detriment, the show adapted them as faithfully as possible, yielding mostly dull interpretations."
The scoop: Creator John Carney says that, in selecting essays to adapt, he looked for those that made him "smile or laugh or feel" something. He hopes, because the stories "came from the hearts of real people," the episodes may be not just entertaining but also "useful" to viewers who may be "suffering or going through something," he says. Carney also believes the show's upbeat, humanistic sensibility may serve a greater purpose -- and a timely one. "There's a lot of flux at the moment in the world," he says. "It's nice to have something that has a positive outlook, even though sometimes it's bittersweet."

'The Morning Show' Apple TV+
The women who populate the "Today"-like show depicted here are mad as hell and not going to take it anymore. Jennifer Aniston plays Alex Levy, who discovers one morning that her longtime cohost, Mitch Kessler (Steve Carell), has been abruptly fired amid sexual misconduct accusations. Scrambling to regain control, she stuns the network's male executives by impulsively announcing Mitch's replacement: the equally furious Bradley Jackson (Reese Witherspoon). Drawing loosely from Brian Stelter's book "Top of the Morning" and evocative of Matt Lauer's downfall (Mitch's desk has a door-closing button), "The Morning Show" is notable for its A-list cast, ripped-from-the-headlines plot and the way it harnesses rage -- female and male.
The reviews: The Boston Globe's Matthew Gilbert writes that the show "has everything ... and yet: It's OK. Just OK." But the Los Angeles Times' Robert Lloyd insists the show is significantly better than some reviews based on early episodes indicate. "As a mix of melodrama and well-written interactions that feel genuinely human, 'The Morning Show' is fairly entrancing," Lloyd writes, suggesting the show builds to an "emotionally satisfying" and "almost operatic" ending.
The scoop: Showrunner Kerry Ehrin ("Bates Motel") acknowledges the Lauer parallels yet insists Mitch's character was an amalgamation of many people. "I don't know Matt Lauer or his story. It isn't in any way a biopic," she says. As for the female-rage theme, Ehrin says, "As a woman you're taught to make things work for everybody. When that comes at your own expense, there's a little pull of rage. Maneuvering in a male-dominated business, many women feel unseen, misunderstood or put in a box, so of course there's deep frustration -- which is not to say men aren't angry. We all want unconditional love and don't get it. We're all pissed off." *

Polls Point To Possible Democratic Vote For Keystone State

Texto completo: Elections always have consequences, as President Barack Obama once said, but not always the ones people expect.
For now, statewide trends seem to favor the still-unknown Democratic presidential nominee beating Republican President Donald Trump next year and reversing his shocking Keystone State win three years ago.
But G. Terry Madonna, the longtime Franklin & Marshall College political analyst and pollster, doesn’t see the trends as surefire forecasts.
“Midterms are not predictive of General Elections that follow,” he said. “Ask Barack Obama.”
Republicans, aided by the tea party movement, won control of the U.S. House in 2010, only two years after Obama’s election, but Obama won re-election in 2012 anyway.
Nonetheless, Democrats have plenty of reasons for optimism.
For starters, Trump’s polling numbers in Pennsylvania remain mixed at best. A re-cent Franklin & Marshall poll showed more than half of voters with a strongly unfavorable view of him and believing he’s doing a poor job.
Voting trends seem to reflect that.
Democrats gain
Last year, Democrats picked up 11 seats in the state House, netted five seats in the Senate and added three U.S. House members.
Two weeks ago, Democrats shockingly won control of governments in the important four counties outside Philadelphia. A third of the state’s voters live in Philadelphia and Bucks, Chester, Delaware and Montgomery counties, which represent only five of the state’s 67 counties.
“The Republicans do have to be concerned about what’s going on in the Philly suburbs,” Madonna said. “What went on in 2018 and again in 2019 in the municipal and county elections was a stunning victory by the Democrats.”
Democrats swept Republicans off the Delaware County Council and gained control of county government for the first time since at least the Civil War, The Philadelphia Inquirer reported. They won a majority in the Chester commissioners office for the first time and control of the Bucks commissioners office. That means Democratic control of Philadelphia and all four Philadelphia suburban counties. Democrats flipped Montgomery years ago.
Almost two-thirds of southeastern voters support the impeachment inquiry into the president, according to the Franklin & Marshall poll.
“It bodes well for Democrats,” Democratic strategist Mike Mikus said.
As concerned as they are, Republicans downplay the Democrats’ southeastern Pennsylvania gains. They point out Trump lost the southeast in 2016 and still won the state by 44,000 votes.
“The Republican Party has been bleeding votes in the southeast for many years,” Republican strategist Vince Galko said. “I think the national atmosphere expedited it this time around.”
But so has GOP
Republicans point to gains of their own in Pittsburgh’s suburban counties. They flipped control of commissioners offices in Washington, Greene and Westmoreland counties, three row offices in Cambria County and two row offices in Beaver County. They also kept control of commissioners offices in Beaver, Lawrence and Fayette counties.
“However, it’s going to come down more to who’s the president running against, what is the atmosphere at that time?” Galko said. “Is it Joe Biden or Elizabeth Warren or someone else? Certainly, that’s going to be a larger factor than just the outcome in southeast PA in this past election.”
In 2016, Galko said, voters went for Trump “because they were just sick of the system, sick of the status quo.”
“They may have been unsure about President Trump, but they wanted somebody to go down to D.C. and knock some tables over. They gave him the benefit of the doubt,” he said. “Will he earn that this time around again? I’m not sure, but I do think the economy is really helping him with those voters. ... We are living through the greatest economy of our lifetime right now.”
Mikus said Republican gains in suburban Pittsburgh matter less.
The southeastern counties where Democrats gained ground have three times as many voters as the southwestern counties where Republicans did.
“The southwestern counties got redder, but they weren’t by big margins,” Mikus said. “They were fairly close races. ... I take heart with that. I don’t think Republicans have much room to grow.”
Lots of factors
A Trump victory would give Republicans back-to back wins here for the first time since 1988 when Vice President George H.W. Bush followed up President Ronald Reagan’s 1984 victory. A recent New York Times/Siena University poll had Trump trailing Biden in Pennsylvania by only 3 points, tied with Warren, a U.S. senator from Massachusetts, and a point behind Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont.
“The real question is will the enthusiasm level of Trump’s core support, at least where you are (in Scranton/Wilkes-Barre) and out in the southwest be sufficient to get him over the finish line in 2020, and we just don’t know that yet,” Madonna said.
Too much remains unknown, he said.
“Remember, we don’t know what’s going to happen with the economy, whether it’s strong or what happens if we slide into a recession. We don’t know if there will be a foreign policy crisis of some kind. And thirdly, we have to see how all this impeachment plays out,” Madonna said. “I won’t rule out that Trump can carry our state again. I won’t rule it out.”

Leon Cooperman: A Wealth Tax Is a 'Dead End'

Texto completo: Making the case against the tax proposal by Senator Elizabeth Warren.
To the Editor:
In "The Billionaires Are Getting Nervous" (editorial, Nov. 10), you characterize me, among others, as a "perturbed plutocrat" short on "finesse" who needs to "get a few things straight." Perhaps we are not alone in that.
By ignoring the details of the candidates' wealth-tax proposals, which you portray as "innovations that require careful consideration," you miss an important point.
There is nothing "innovative" about an explicit wealth tax. It has been tried, and debunked by experience, repeatedly around the world, inherently plagued by issues of tax avoidance, asset valuation and, in this country, constitutionality.
As I stated in a recent open letter to Senator Elizabeth Warren, a more constructive path to raising public funds for a progressive legislative agenda that might stand a chance of passing Congress and weathering constitutional scrutiny, and whose revenue-raising potential is unquestionable, could include eliminating the exemption of capital gains from taxation upon death; the carried-interest exemption for private equity and hedge funds; and the capital-gains, tax-deferral preference accorded like-kind exchanges under Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code.
The current debate, if unyoked from the candidates' polarizing rhetoric and calculation of short-term political gain through vilification of the rich, could be refocused on suggestions like these and on what the maximum tax rate on individuals and corporations should be.
But an explicit wealth tax is a proven dead end, and there's nothing innovative about that.

Texto completo: For the Valley News
With the focus on Ukraine and Turkey last week, it may have been easy to miss the news story about the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s release of a proposed rule, called “Strengthening Transparency in Regulatory Science.” This proposal would limit the research necessary to understand the impacts of pollution on public health.
Normally, I would consider such a stance out of step for the EPA’s mission “to protect human health and the environment.” Unfortunately, I am not surprised. Just this year, the EPA, as well as a number of other executive branch agencies, have quietly been taking actions that rescind air and water quality standards. Worse, there seems to be systematic dismantling of monitoring and data collection and overt actions to silence or discount the scientific findings that are necessary to inform policy creation.
The administration’s strategy reflects the promises by President Donald Trump to both disengage with the Paris climate accord and walk back regulations that he claims are imposing undue costs on Americans and stifling economic development. Earlier this year, The New York Times reported that since Trump took office, the EPA, the Department of the Interior, the Bureau of Land Management and other executive branch agencies have rolled back 85 environmental rules and regulations.
Since the beginning of 2017, the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia Law School has been tracking deregulatory activity related to climate change. The center has documented more than 150 such actions that challenge or attempt to silence the science behind the policies. The Union of Concern Scientists has been more focused on the administration’s attack on science and the ramifications on our nation’s ability to meet public health and environmental challenges.
This concerted effort has been multifaceted, ranging from burying peer-reviewed scientific reports to appointing nonscientists to head scientific advisory committees (or even disbanding such committees) to leaving scientific positions vacant and reducing the voice of professional scientists on staff.
This strategy seems to be working. The one bright spot has been court decisions to counter actions by the Department of Energy, Department of Agriculture and the EPA to cut back emissions standards or freeze regulations.
And there are steps being taken at the state level to ameliorate some of the actions occurring on the national stage. California is leading a group of 21 states in challenging the administration’s rollback of tailpipe standards. There is also the United States Climate Alliance, initiated by the governors of California, New York and Washington just after the president announced his intention to withdraw from the Paris climate accord. This coalition now has bipartisan support from 25 state governments, whose initiatives are being informed both by science and economics.
One last point: As a former high school science teacher, I worry that this effort to discount the value of science in informing the nation’s environmental and health policies sends a bad signal to the next generation of scientists.

Texto completo: One winter afternoon, as we stood at the corner waiting to cross the street, my friend turned to me and said he wished he'd get run over by a car. It would make everything he worried about go away.
It was 2017, less than a month into the new Trump administration, yet it had already signed executive orders to increase border security, empower ruthless Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, and ban millions of people in Muslim-majority countries from traveling to the United States.
Immigrant families, and especially undocumented immigrants like my friend, were suddenly living with more fear and uncertainty than ever. Things have hardly gotten any better since then. More than 5,400 children have been separated from their families at the U.S.-Mexico border since July 2017.
Trump even tried to terminate Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), which protects nearly 700,000 people from deportation. Only the courts and the collective power of undocumented organizers have delayed him – and even that could change if the Supreme Court upholds the administration's efforts to kill the program. The court hears oral arguments on the efforts to end the program Tuesday.
As Karla Cornejo Villavicencio put it in a column for The New York Times: "Undocumented life in America is hard on the mind and body." And the stories proving it are piling up.
A 21-year-old DACA recipient recently said she lies awake until 5 a.m. worrying about her family being separated. She said she had put on weight from stress-eating and even developed pneumonia.
The effects are even worse for those unlucky enough to experience immigration detention. A recent report by Congress' bipartisan Commission on Civil Rights warned the Trump administration that the severe trauma caused by the incarceration of children and families, the separation of children from their parents, unsanitary conditions in detention facilities, and inhumane practices like solitary confinement are all proven to increase the risk of post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety and depression in the immigrants who face these challenges.
Immigration enforcement authorities aren't the only source of stress, either. As part of the New Mexico Dream Team, an immigrant rights group, I co-authored two reports discussing how both educational and health care institutions come with barriers that can contribute to the mental health crises immigrants experience.
In our interviews with more than a dozen people in our state who identified as undocumented, DACA-mented, or who belong to a mixed immigration status family, we found that racial microaggressions, discriminatory practices by school administrators and concern over how to afford higher education increased their mental health stress
New Mexico is a relatively immigrant-friendly state. I shudder to think of what it's like for people in more hostile states. Thankfully, community-based health clinics and undocumented-led grassroots initiatives like the New Mexico Dream Team's UndocuHealth program are serving undocumented youth.
What we actually need is for Congress to abolish the systems and structures that allow undocumented families to be persecuted in the first place.

Texto completo: Jim Beattie died Wednesday. He was 77. He was a 6-9 heavyweight boxer and had one of the most interesting stories you will find among Minnesota's home-state athletes.
Search with today's technology for Beattie and there are numerous articles from Robert Lipsyte, who first gained fame as a boxing writer for the New York Times.
All the legends of East Coast sportswriting had something to offer on Jim Beattie during those 33 mercurial months, from when he arrived in New York City in April 1963 to seek the heavyweight championship of the world, to January 1966, when he was "involuntarily retired for his own sake" by the New York State Athletic Commission.
Publicist Gene Schoor created the hype for James J. Beattie, a young boxer from St. Paul chosen in a national search for the next heavyweight champion. It started with a classified ad that Schoor placed in many newspapers, promising $10,000 a year and all training expenses paid "while you learn" the skills required to win the heavyweight crown.
Schoor and his partners -- Bill Nicholson, Sy Krieg and Phil Krupin -- formed Kid Galahad Inc. Beattie eventually was the chosen one from a half-dozen finalists.
What did a wide-eyed 20-year-old from the most blue-collar of St. Paul backgrounds think of the frantic pace of Manhattan?
Jeff Beattie, the second of three sons and five children, said: "He absolutely loved it. He enjoyed people. … He loved being somebody."
Beattie's first fight in New York was a one-punch knockout of 5-8 Duke Johnson on May 28, 1963. Official time: 24 seconds. His last was a thumping delivered by James Woody in Madison Square Garden on Dec. 10, 1965.
New York pulled his license. Beattie started a comeback with Glen Flanagan as his trainer in St. Paul. He returned to the ring in September 1966 and quit on his own after a couple of losses in 1968.
He had another comeback in 1976, eventually fighting and losing to a young Scott LeDoux on Feb. 20, 1979. He retired with a record of 40-10, with 32 knockouts.
Not Galahad-like, not a heavyweight champ, but not bad.
Write to Patrick Reusse by e-mailing sports@startribune.com and including his name in the subject line.
PLUS THREE
• Beattie played "The Kid," James Earl Jones' foil in the climactic fight scene of "The Great White Hope," in the 1970 film based on a Broadway play.
• As Gene Schoor claimed, did Beattie once punch a police horse? Son Jeff wasn't sure, but said his father loved "Blazing Saddles" and laughed loudly at that famous scene.
• Beattie was the four-time Upper Midwest Gold Gloves heavyweight champion (1959-62).

The dirty water problem in Middle America

Texto completo: CRESCO, Iowa — If you come to this rural Iowa town, you'll learn about a problem that may sound familiar.
In the New York Times, for instance, you have learned that many residents in Newark, New Jersey, have gone nearly two years since they could turn on the faucets in their homes to take a drink of water, cook, or even brush their teeth. The culprit: Lead-coated pipes that have begun seeping their poisons into the homes and schools in a scattering of neighborhoods.
The problem was first ignored and denied. City officials declared the water safe and then took months to admit their error. Eventually, one study revealed that lead entered the water supply due to corrosion treatment problems at a local plant. Even after it was addressed, the federal government found that water filters distributed to residents were ineffective, and the free water they distributed had to be temporarily halted after some bottles had passed their best by date.
“As far as testing reveals, it is only a small portion of the city, but if you are living in that small part of the city, it is a major health risk,” explained Seth Siegel, author of Troubled Water and the foremost expert on water safety in the country.
The dirty water problem in Flint, Michigan, became a worldwide story.
America’s water crisis isn’t unique to Newark or Flint, though. People in low-income, majority-minority cities and those in small, rural white communities in Appalachia and the Midwest are suffering every time they turn on the spigot in America.
The Natural Resources Defense Council studied data compiled through the Safe Drinking Water Act and found that contaminants that harm American's health are found in tap water in every state in the nation.
More than 80,000 violations were reported by community water systems, affecting nearly 77 million people, with 70% of those violations occurring in communities with 500 people or less.
In some cities, water is tainted by decaying lead-laden pipes. In rural areas, it is polluted by contaminants that come from farm fertilizer and pesticides.
“Water safety doesn’t pick and choose who it impacts,” said Siegel. “It is an issue rural people, city people, suburban people, ex-urban people, Democrats, progressives, Republicans, and conservatives are affected by.”
“Nobody is immune because it turns out that every city has got contaminants in their water,” Siegel said. “It affects the national health profile and the national intelligence. When people are drinking leaded water, it is a confirmed fact that it reduces the IQ of the people who drink that water. And it is confirmed that you are more likely to drop out of high school, that you’re more likely to get involved with crime if you have been drinking leaded water.”
Rural areas are particularly at risk. They tend to be serviced by small, underfunded utilities, or they are using private drinking wells that are not regulated by the EPA.
In the 1,100 miles that separate Newark from Cresco, hundreds of smaller towns in Appalachia and the Midwest face the same perilous crisis as the larger cities. But their issues remain largely unknown. Out here, the news coverage is scant, sometimes because no local paper exists.
Yet fertilizers and coal mine leakage often find their way into wells and rural water systems that could harm the residents.
Hunter Slifka is part of changing that problem. The 23-year-old wanted to make a difference in his hometown of Cresco.
Hunter Slifka reintroduces native brook trout into Silver Creek in Iowa. He's part of a successful effort to diminish manure and soil contamination in water.
He found his path after getting a degree in conservation management at Upper Iowa University and coming back to work for the Howard County Soil & Water Conservation District.
He’s also the local high school wrestling coach. Now he’s focused on removing nitrates and bacteria in the area’s streams and groundwater.
These soil and water conservation districts across the American agriculture heartland, funded by the Department of Agriculture as well as downriver local utilities, are putting in natural barriers that reduce or eliminate the amount of fertilizer and pesticides that get into groundwater and runoff into rivers.
“Water is the great connector in communities, and the quality of it affects everyone,” Slifka told me. “My goal was to make sure we were able to have safe water for people who live on the farms here, but also enough water for farmers to have for their crops.”
Siegel says the solution for everyone will come “when people understand that their children's health, IQ, and futures are at risk, when their own fertility is at risk, and when they realize that cancers come from many of these chemicals. When people understand all this, they will demand action.”
Siegel says when there is a popular will for change, there will be transformation.
“Whether they’re in rural America or urban America, where they’re fancy, elite people, whether they’re simple, dirt-under-the-fingernails people, it’s going to be the same,” he said. “That’s when politicians find the nerve to act.”

Leonard Pitts: Barriers zigzag across America like a scar

Texto completo: A few words about walls.
Unsurprisingly, the one Donald Trump is trying to build on the southern border — the one he swore Mexico would pay for — has proven, like most things he touches, an embarrassing failure. First came news early this month that smugglers have been able to cut through the barrier with a simple reciprocating saw, available at Home Depot for prices starting at less than $100. Then, TBS’ “Full Frontal with Samantha Bee” aired a segment demonstrating that the wall, which Trump has said “can’t be climbed,” can actually be climbed in as little as 15 seconds and by climbers as young as 8.
<img class="size-full wp-image-2657490" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2019/02/Leonard-Pitts-Color.jpg" alt="" width="290" height="193" />
Maybe Mexico should demand a refund.
In the meantime, and with much less fanfare, construction continues on a wall of much further-reaching consequences. You see, while the wall on the border is supposed to repel immigrants and smugglers, this one repels something many of us find even more threatening: contradictory opinions. Consider three recent news stories:
• In Washington, the White House announces it will cancel government subscriptions to The Washington Post and New York Times. The administration calls it a cost-saving measure, but the truth is obvious. Trump famously hates both newspapers.
• In Citrus County, Florida, county commissioners reject the local library’s request for a digital subscription to The Times. Says Commissioner Scott Carnahan, “Fake news, OK, I agree with President Trump. I don’t want the New York Times in this county.”
• In Coeur d’Alene, Idaho, the library reports that an unknown patron has been hiding books critical of Trump and conservatism, deliberately mis-shelving them in other sections of the library. As that person explained in a note, “I am going to continue hiding these books in the most obscure places I can find to keep this propaganda out of the hands of young minds.”
The sheer snowflakery of all this cannot, of course, be overstated. And yes, it reeks of anti-intellectualism, that proud, bullyboy ignorance that has too often fed books — and bodies — into bonfires.
But this also speaks to barriers of intellectual — and emotional — separation that now zigzag across America like a scar, splitting towns, colleges, churches, workplaces, friendships and families. Nor is the barrier only being built from one side. As liberal college students demand “safe spaces” and “trigger warnings” so they won’t have to confront contradiction of their beliefs, it becomes painfully clear this wall is a bipartisan project. And that should concern us all.
This is no argument for false equivalence, nor even for civility. But it is an argument for intellectual freedom — for honoring people’s sacred right to speak and to hear.
The genius of America has always been that it believed in the marketplace of ideas, believed we should have access to the broadest possible range, and that if we did, we would, more often than not, choose the good over the bad, the right over the wrong, the intelligent over the stupid.
Yes, that trust has been sorely tested lately, but is the answer to abandon it completely? To do so would be to abandon everything that makes this country worth the trouble. To do so would be craven and un-American. As in commissioners of a podunk Florida county defending its citizens from The New York Times.
One doesn’t know whether to laugh or cry. That wall Trump is trying to build against immigrants will go down as an expensive boondoggle. But you know what will cost us more in the long run?
Any wall we build against ourselves.

Texto completo: El presidente, Donald Trump, publicó este domingo, como hace con frecuencia, un tuit en el que mencionó a uno de sus principales rivales, el ex vicepresidente Joe Biden . Pero el contenido del mensaje fue diferente del habitual, ya que pareció ser una defensa ante el brutal ataque dialéctico que Corea del Norte reservó al demócrata este viernes , cuando los definió “un perro rabioso” al que “hay que matar a palazos”.
En el mismo día, el mandatario recibió en cambio un duro ataque de la demócrata Nancy Pelosi, quien dijo que su conducta en el caso Ucrania, por el que es actualmente investigado en el Congreso, fue “mucho peor” de la de Richard Nixon, ex presidente que dimitió por el escándalo Watergate.
Todo eso ocurre un día antes de que comience otra semana intensa al presidente, ya que se prevén nuevos testimonios públicos en el proceso que podría llevar a un juicio político en su contra.
Y justo después de que un candidato de su partido perdiera las elecciones de este sábado para arrebatarle el puesto de gobernador a un contrincante demócrata en Luisiana pese a su compromiso electoral para impulsar este cambio.
Desde que la Cámara lanzó su investigación en septiembre, varios funcionarios de la administración Trump han alegado que el presidente vinculó ayudas militares estadounidenses a Ucrania con una investigación de este país sobre supuestas actividades irregulares de Biden y su hijo Hunter .
Los republicanos han defendido al presidente señalando que la ayuda fue finalmente concedida mientras que Ucrania nunca anunció una investigación sobre los Biden. Pero Pelosi y otros demócratas aseguraron, al condicionar la ayuda a las investigaciones, Trump estaba intentando cometer sobornos .
Tras las primeras declaraciones públicas de testigos esta semana, entre ellos el de la ex embajadora en Ucrania Marie Yovanovitch, más funcionarios de la administración Trump están llamados a testificar públicamente a partir de este martes, según The New York Times.
Durante el testimonio de Yovanovitch, el mandatario mandó un tuit denigrando el trabajo de la exembajadora. Adam Schiff, demócrata que lidera la investigación contra Trump, leyó el tuit en cámara y ella admitió sentirse intimidada por el presidente.
Esta semana, entre otros, está previsto el testimonio del embajador de EEUU ante la Unión Europea, Gordon Sondland. Uno de los demócratas que investigan a Trump aseguró en una entrevista en Fox que se trata de un testigo de primera mano.

Texto completo: URBAN NUTCRACKER
Presented by City Ballet of Boston. At Boch Center Shubert Theatre, Dec. 19-28. Tickets $29-$69;
866-348-9738, www.bochcenter.org
When Anthony Williams's “Urban Nutcracker" bursts onto the stage of the Boch Center Shubert Theatre Dec. 19-28, the semi-professional production by his City Ballet of Boston will be enlivened by a passel of 75 kids in all shapes and sizes and from varied cultural backgrounds. A contemporary, multicultural version of the holiday dance classic set in the city of Boston, “Urban Nutcracker" embraces not just ballet, but styles ranging from street dance and tap to flamenco, and it's less about the perfect arabesque than the spirit of inclusion and community.
“I'm trying to reflect the city as we see it today, its true diversity," says Williams, who created the show 19 years ago. “In most of the downtown theaters, you hardly see that diversity in the audience or onstage. We have diversity of cast, of music — Duke Ellington along with the Tchaikovsky — different dance traditions, and the diversity of the audience." (Through the Boch Center's ticket access program with the sponsorship of Adage Capital, the production is providing 3,000 free tickets to underprivileged Boston area children and their families.)
Williams, Boston Ballet's first African-American principal dancer and a beloved teacher, is a man on a mission. He found his own calling in ballet at age 16 after trouble as a member of a street gang. He has offered scholarship dance training for inner city kids for more than a quarter century — his studio's goal is “diversity through dance." “That experience [of studying dance] has helped young people grow into responsible adults," Williams says.
However, finding kids from disadvantaged neighborhoods around the city who can dance and whose families can commit to an intensive rehearsal and performance schedule is no easy task. But Williams has a new, secret weapon in Jason Jordan. A professionally trained dancer/choreographer with lead roles in the show, Jordan is also a full-time dance teacher at the Orchard Park K-8 Pilot School in Roxbury who is committed to spreading the joy of movement to every kid he meets.
Jordan teaches dance to roughly 400 students each year, and as he joins the “Urban Nutcracker" family for the first time this season, he's also helping Williams find talented young dancers for a new scholarship program at Tony Williams Dance Center. Set to launch with open auditions in January, the program is called City Ballet Relevé and will provide free, intensive ballet training to roughly 15 youngsters, aged 8-12, from underserved communities. “I see Jason as a conduit," Williams says, “a perfect pipeline from the Boston public schools."
The program, funded through a grant from the Carl and Ruth Shapiro Family Foundation, is designed to serve as the first step of a sequential feeder system for Williams's company, which Williams says he started partly as a way to keep “Urban Nutcracker" going even after he's gone. (No worries — retirement is not in the immediate future for the vigorous 73-year-old.) The program will be small scale, audition-based, fast tracked, and offer lots of personal attention. “We're looking for kids that have the drive and passion, even if they don't have great feet and perfect bodies," says Williams.
Like Williams, Jordan identifies with the kids he's looking to recruit. “What Tony is trying to do with this program, that was my life," he says. “It's mind-blowing that I can help kids have a similar life change." Jordan got his first taste of the power of dance at the age of seven, when he wowed the crowd at a Brooklyn house party and walked off with the $5 prize for best dancer. The following year, he auditioned into what is now called Ballet Tech, a New York City public school designed by Eliot Feld in 1977 to provide rigorous ballet training for children who might not otherwise be exposed to the art form. “I didn't know much about ballet," Jordan recalls, “but I knew I wanted to dance, and the access to training and validation for a young boy like me — it was everything. It changed my life."
By age 15, Jordan was dancing professionally, a feat he says was unheard of in his neighborhood. He went on to a promising career, performing with Feld Ballets/NY, Les Grands Ballets Canadiens de Montreal, RUBBERBANDance, Cedar Lake Contemporary Ballet, and Buglisi Dance Theatre, among others. The New York Times called him a “coolly confident … luxuriant" dancer. When a hip injury required surgery, Jordan says the public school job in Boston “… just landed in my lap. I took it for two years to get insurance, have the surgery, then I was going to go back to dancing. But I fell in love with the kids, and seven years later, I'm still here teaching and loving it."
Now 41, Jordan says “Urban Nutcracker" is letting him reconnect to the joy of rehearsing and performing. “I was missing something in life that is so beautiful, and this is an opportunity to dance and have connections with all the these happy kids running around, going over the steps. You can see the excitement in their faces."
The new City Ballet Relevé will help extend the energy and enthusiasm of the “Urban Nutcracker" experience into a serious ballet program. “It's a buzz when I see the amount of talent that would have gone untapped otherwise," he says. “I think of all the things I've learned and been blessed with — I love giving that back."

Hasan Minhaj, Steeping in the News

Texto completo: The host of "Patriot Act" shares what he watched, read and listened to this week.
In "Patriot Act," his topical comedy series on Netflix, Hasan Minhaj is ambitious. "The types of stories that I gravitate to are big international stories, big cultural stories or big domestic issues," he said. "That's the gamut for me."
But in his personal life, intimacy rules: the cozy evenings spent cooking in his Hell's Kitchen apartment with his wife, Beena Patel, who works in health management; the mornings with their 19-month-old daughter; the late nights watching a sketch comedy show or listening to his favorite sports podcast.
Minhaj, 34, tracked his cultural diary for The Times, starting with an appearance at Stand Up for Heroes at Madison Square Garden on Nov. 4 and ending with his weekly Wednesday-morning barber's buzz.

Monday Evening
The Bob Woodruff Foundation has this show called Stand Up for Heroes, which helps give aid and services to veterans. It was really cool, like a "Daily Show" reunion. It was me, Jon Stewart, John Oliver, Ronny Chieng, and then Bruce Springsteen and Sheryl Crow performed.
My parents immigrated here [from India] in the early '80s, so my frame of reference for everything is late '80s, early '90s. Bruce Springsteen, David Bowie -- these guys were never these huge temporal parts of my childhood. When I was walking backstage, I was like, "Oh, it's Bruce just tuning his guitar." It doesn't mean that same thing to me as to everybody in the audience that was going, "Bruce!" And it's actually incredibly liberating. Because for Jon, Bruce is the man. And for me, Bruce is this raspy-voiced dude that talks about growing up in a small town in Jersey. And I'm like, "All right, dude, we get it."
My holy trinity is Jay-Z, Notorious B.I.G., Mitch Richmond, who played for the Sacramento Kings. Those are the guys that would make me go like, "Oh my God, they're here!" Now, if Shah Rukh Khan, who is a huge Bollywood star, walked in, I wouldn't be able to do my set.
Tuesday Morning
Morning is my time with our baby daughter because my nights go until pretty late so I don't get a chance to put her down. She'll get up at around 6:30, and we'll listen to "The Lion King" Broadway soundtrack. She loves the opening song, "Circle of Life." Then I'll change her diaper and as I clean her off, I know that one day she will be changing mine. We'll also watch this show called "Little Baby Bum," where the characters will do everyday tasks that children do. They'll sing songs: "I wash, wash my hair. I brush, brush my teeth." In her music class at the library, one of the teachers speaks French. So there's this song that she kept singing, and now I ask Alexa to sing "Alouette" to her. Then we'll run down the hallway. She'll knock on people's doors because other people in our building have dogs. She loves dogs. And I understand why: They're other creatures that are her height.
As soon as I get in my office, I have The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal on my desk. One of the things I've always tried to avoid is the endless scroll that is the news. What I love about a physical newspaper is that there's a finite amount of news. I love turning to the Opinion page and being like: These are the eight opinions. That's it. Whereas with Twitter, the opinions never end.
I read "Digital Minimalism" by Cal Newport and that really changed a lot of things for me. My cellphone is in black and white and has super low lighting, so it's very ugly and I look at it less. And there are no social media apps. I use the screen only when it's absolutely necessary. It's about my own head space. We've become a sea of screen babies. I try to minimize that noise for my own humanity.
When I found out that the heads of all these [tech] companies -- Sundar Pichai, Satya Nadella, Steve Jobs -- don't let their kids use screens, I'm like, No way [am I letting my daughter]. It's like finding out the CEO of McDonald's never had French fries.
Tuesday Afternoon
The Buzzfeed article "How Millennials Became the Burnout Generation" has been making the rounds within the office because we're doing a big episode on mental health this week. Mental health has been something that we've been tracking for a long time because it's finally something we're talking about in the cultural zeitgeist. Our show, I think, is at its best when we talk about things that actually affect people's day-to-day lives, and then we talk about the mechanisms that are put in place to make it hard for people.
I scroll through Twitter and read Jess Dweck and Mike Drucker. Jess and Mike will always have a new angle to think about something that's happening topically. Jess had this tweet the other day: "When Stephen Miller proposed, do you think he got down on one knee or all six knees." Mike had this tweet on Halloween: "Just took 20 mgs of melatonin. let's get this Halloween party started with some [expletive] nightmares." I love how at the end of both of those jokes it just takes a hard left turn into absurdity.
Tuesday Evening
Beena is an amazing cook. She loves getting inspo from Chrissy Teigen's Instagram story, or we'll see a Tasty video, and I'll be like, "Oh my God, that's really good." We'll generally watch that stuff at night when I get home. There's something so fulfilling about watching a task get completed via time lapse. Beena made this Southwest Tex-Mex rice bowl, and because it was in the Instant Pot, the chicken was really tender and the texture was amazing. I love the Instant Pot.
Because my whole life is politics and news, it's really nice to have something that matters but doesn't matter, and sports is a great outlet for that. Quentin Richardson and Darius Miles were two big Clippers players for me in the late '90s, early 2000s. They now have a podcast, "Knuckleheads," and they're able to talk about their experience in ways that they never were able to when I was growing up. They're able to get Kobe Bryant very comfortable because they're like: "I played against you. What were you thinking when you did this to me?" They're laughing and they're really loose. It's as if you're in the locker room with them.
And then I watched an episode of "I Think You Should Leave With Tim Robinson." First of all, Tim Robinson is hilarious, and I love that show because not only is it insanely funny, but -- and this is rare for sketch comedy -- the sketches are perfectly timed. It's absurd and crazy, but the sketches are only two minutes long, and it just gets my mind off something as heavy as insurance companies denying people's mental health care treatment.

Wednesday Morning
I get a haircut done in the studio the day we tape every week. I have this speaker in the makeup room, right where the chair is, and I'll listen to a mix of hip-hop from, I would say, '96 to '98, like Jay-Z's "Reasonable Doubt" and Biggie's "Life After Death."
I love my barber. When I first moved to the city, Jordan Klepper told me about this barbershop called Frank's Chop Shop. There was always this long line for this one barber named Hiro. And when I finally got the show, I mustered up the courage to ask Hiro if he would cut my hair on show days. What's great is it's the one time of the week where I'm in the office before everybody else. Nobody can come down. There's nothing that I have to immediately answer. The script was already turned in the night before. Everybody in the studio is already ingesting all the graphics. It's this one hour where I'm basically alone, and it's awesome.

Texto completo: Searching for a cure for my climate crisis grief.
One day early this fall, 19 people gathered in a small event space in Red Hook, Brooklyn, and sat in a circle. They included an immigration lawyer, a therapist, an Extinction Rebellion protester, an artist and me. Outside, it was cloudlessly sunny and hot in a way that would have once been described as unseasonable but that nowadays is just mid-September.
We were there for a workshop called "Cultivating Active Hope: Living With Joy Amidst the Climate Crisis," a title that sounded wildly optimistic. I was there because, for the life of me, I could not understand how anyone was coping with the climate crisis.
Have you ever known someone who cited the Anthropocene in a dating profile? Who doled out carbon offset gift certificates at the holidays? Who sees new babies and immediately flashes to the approximately 15 tons of carbon emissions the average American emits per year? Who walks around shops thinking about where all the packaging ends up? You do now.
Unlike millions, I haven't been directly affected by the climate crisis -- not really, not yet. But the barrage of cataclysmic planetary news, the galloping wildfires, the smack of 90-degree New York autumn days all felt so at odds with the regular tickings of human life that I often felt quite mad. I felt complicit by merely existing. After all, I belonged to the species that was taking most of the other ones down.
As much as I want to chain myself to an old-growth tree (thanks, "The Overstory"), my job at The Times precludes me from going all in as an activist. So I donate to environmental and humane causes, eat vegan, compost, take public transport, carry around bamboo utensils, post alarming articles on Facebook, buy second hand and stock up on offsets -- all decisions I have the luxury to make. And yet none of it has been balm.
Asking some people around me how they were faring did not help. I heard that it was too late anyway. That I shouldn't care since I don't have kids. That the planet will, one distant day at least, be fine. One friend suggested that my climate angst was an extension of my melancholic leanings, which struck me as plausible, but not quite right. We know that the future is looking bad, that the present already is, and that inaction, especially here in America, is making it all worse. But how are we supposed to live in our hearts and souls with such an existential threat that is also, as birds and bees vanish and trees topple and die, so excruciatingly intimate?
Finally this fall, after a kayaking trip to Alaska prompted by a desire to see glaciers while they still exist -- and being greeted by wildfires -- I resolved to seek answers.
And what I learned, in the Red Hook workshop and in long conversations with psychologists, deep ecologists, an indigenous activist and Western Buddhists, was more or less a prescription for handling climate grief.
It looks like this: Live like the crisis is urgent. Embrace the pain, but don't stop there. Seek out a spiritual path to forge gratitude, compassion and acceptance, because operating out of denial, anger or fear only hurts us in the end.
There is dismissiveness about whether individual choices like how we consume and transport ourselves matter: Why cancel that trip to Europe if it's too late anyway and if everyone is still addicted to fossil fuels? But Lou Leonard, a founder of One Earth Sangha, a Buddhist group focused on the crisis, told me that living like climate change is real and that we can do something about it are signals to others -- and can help shift cultural norms. Who would have thought Burger King would one day serve delicious plant-based meat?
"We need to break the cognitive dissonance in as many ways as we can in order to be more real with what's happening," Mr. Leonard said. Making seemingly inconvenient changes now, he said, can also prepare us for what might be to come.
Zhiwa Woodbury, an eco-psychologist, believes that we are collectively experiencing climate trauma, of which we are both perpetrators and victims -- our assault on the biosphere is an assault on ourselves. Altering habits like how we eat can make people feel more empowered and less overwhelmed, he said, and can shift our relationship with the natural world. After all, the belief that natural resources exist for our heedless exploitation got us to this point in the first place (and made us none the happier). "It makes us feel good that we're doing something and it gets back to the idea of shared responsibility," Mr. Woodbury said. "The idea that individuals are powerless only exists because we've made them feel powerless."
Embracing the pain was something I struggled with more. Didn't we deserve to feel bad? Maybe. But feeling despair is itself a kind avoidance. "What despair is telling you is that you haven't processed your emotions," Mr. Woodbury said.
In the Red Hook workshop, which used the pioneering decades-old work of the environmental grief activist Joanna Macy, the facilitator, Jess Serrante, said something that hit me like a thunderclap.
"Our pain for what is happening is the other side of the coin of our love for the world," she told us. "We feel such depths of despair because we love the planet so much."
Several psychologists told me they are telling the same thing to patients who are grappling with eco-despair: Feeling depressed about the crisis is actually a sane, healthy response. Yet as a culture, we pathologize depression as a personal failing, and as individuals, we avoid it, partly, Ms. Serrante said, out of the fear that if we dive in we won't emerge. But that causes us to shut down. By jumping into the pain, it can alchemize into something bigger, Ms. Serrante told us, and reconnect us with our deepest selves.
The key is to channel it, through everyday actions or joining wider movements, and also to figure out a way to face it without being controlled by it, because operating out of fear, anger and blame burns us out. That is where the spiritual component comes in -- to find a way to move to a place not of tacit acceptance, but of fierce, roaring compassion.
Mr. Woodbury and Mr. Leonard both got burned out by environmental advocacy and found emotional resilience in Buddhist practices and a more compassionate view of human nature. "There's nothing more powerful than a broken heart, as long as you have a spiritual container to hold it," Mr. Woodbury told me.
I've begun tiptoeing in that direction, trying to learn how to be spiritually nimble and to have faith in people again. Feeling connected -- with others, with ourselves -- is an antidote to tough feelings we try to keep at bay by distracting and numbing ourselves. I also hold fast to something else Mr. Woodbury told me; that the crisis could force us to heal our relationship with the natural world, and there is no room for despair in that.
Still, eco-pessimism dies hard. In Red Hook, Ms. Serrante had us pair off and tell each other why we were grateful to be alive at this time. My eyebrows shot up.
"I'm grateful about being alive in this time because," I said haltingly to my partner, a man who worked in corporate disaster preparedness, "people are more aware than ever about what we have wrought? Because this is the logical conclusion to what the industrial revolution set in motion?"
"Wow," the disaster preparedness guy replied.
He told me he was grateful that he was living at a time when we could see gorgeous animals, plants and sprawling wilderness that might not be around much longer. My breath caught. I hadn't thought of that. Something shifted. I noticed the disaster preparedness guy's eyes were red and leaky, and that mine were, too.
Afterward, stepping onto the baking sidewalk, I found myself paying greedy attention to the rustling trees, the flutter of teeny birds. I felt a visceral thrum of gratitude for what still exists, for what has to be fought for, while it still can be beheld.

Texto completo: "Fefu and Her Friends," perhaps the finest work of the Cuban-American director and playwright María Irene Fornés, is finally getting a New York revival.
When the Cuban-American director and playwright María Irene Fornés died last fall, the New York Times obituary referred to her as "an underrecognized genius." Now, what is perhaps her finest work, "Fefu and Her Friends," can be seen at the Polonsky Shakespeare Center. Revolutionary in its form and daring in its philosophy, "Fefu," from 1977, hasn't played Off Broadway since its debut. Think of it as the masterpiece no one has seen.
"It's been a long time coming, for real," said Lileana Blain-Cruz, the director. She fell for the play a decade ago, in graduate school, attracted by its humor, its mystery, its beauty. She spent years wondering, "Why is nobody doing this?" she said.
Set in 1935, at a well-appointed country house peopled with well-appointed women, the play seems, on its gleaming surface, to be straightforward. The set, with its sofa, coffee table and upstage piano is gallingly simple. Superficially, so is the plot: Stephany, nicknamed Fefu, has gathered seven friends together to plan a school fund-raiser. From noon until dusk they gossip and drink, dance and rehearse, eat chocolates and aim a double-barreled shotgun.
The shotgun is loaded with blanks. Probably.
But after the first act, the audience divides into four groups, each assigned to a different location -- a study, a kitchen, a bedroom, a lawn. The groups watch four scenes in different order, an act of immersive theater, or promenade theater, dreamed up decades before those before those styles became popular.
And the fund-raiser plot is simply cover for vital, unanswerable questions about desire and fear and trauma, about how to be a person, especially a female person, about how to survive. It is a play about what happens when women talk to each other.
Marc Robinson, a professor of theater studies at Yale University and the author of "The Theater of Maria Irene Fornés," called it "an incredible work. Its challenges are still formidable in the best, most stimulating way."
On Halloween morning, I slipped into a dance studio in Midtown West to watch a rehearsal for the show, which is now in previews and opens on Nov. 24. (Like a lot of "Fefu" devotees, I discovered the play in college. I've never seen it either.) Under overbright lights, the cast and some of the creative team made a circle for a warm-up -- bending, arcing, sticking their tongues out like statues of Kali while an Olga Guillot bolero poured from the speakers and Blain-Cruz, in a cropped blouse and paradise pink lipstick, shouted encouragement.
Once warm, the actors arranged themselves on and around a rehearsal sofa, clutching empty cocktail glasses and nibbling the vegan macaroons an assistant stage manager had baked. Nearly everyone was a woman, nearly everyone was a person of color. Off Broadway, that's still unusual. So was the mood that day, a giddy mix of excitement, risk and dedication to a shared endeavor.
I had spent a lot of that week speaking to playwrights and professors, people like me who love the play, often obsessively, but have never seen it performed professionally. "Fefu" remains a campus favorite and regional productions turn up, like a well-received production this past summer at Los Angeles's Odyssey Theater, but they're rare.
Jeremy O. Harris, the author of "Slave Play," saw a college production as an undergraduate at DePaul University. "I remember being so enthralled by the language and the sense of motion inside of the piece," he said by telephone. Recently, he and the playwright Will Arbery ("Heroes of the Fourth Turning") bonded over their "Fefu" fandom.
"This play is stapled to my soul and it hurts," Arbery wrote in an email, "I don't have to understand it: I believe it."
When the playwright Jackie Sibblies Drury adopted a cat, she named her "Fefu." (The cat has since had kittens -- the friends.) She read the play in college "and was immediately completely obsessed with it," she said. "It's the first play I had read that was about women in a very deep and considered way."
The structure of "Fefu" informs -- unconsciously, Drury said -- her Pulitzer Prize-winning "Fairview," a play that also emphasizes subjective experience by asking audiences to move within the theater.
If "Fefu" can inspire this reverence, why do so few theaters stage it? Yes, Fornés, like her peer Adrienne Kennedy, has a reputation, not always deserved, for difficulty. (This never stopped Beckett or Pinter.) The language can skew arch or formal -- Fefu opens the play saying, "My husband married me to have a constant reminder of how loathsome women are." Some moments tilt toward surrealism. And like ice or a fish or a rain-slicked path, "Fefu" is slippery, its gist ever sliding away.
Fornés herself said that she was dealing less with story or plot than with "the mechanics of the mind, some kind of spiritual survival, a process of thought." Which exasperated critics like Walter Kerr. "If I lasted as long as I did," he wrote in his 1978 Times review, "it was because I kept hoping during my constant journeyings that I might find a play in the very next room."
But that slipperiness is also a strength, an acknowledgment that the person across the aisle might see the play differently than I do (if we're lucky enough to see it at all), that we might approach it with discrete values, experiences and concerns. "What I love about María Irene Fornés, her plays don't dictate to you what they're about," Harris told me. The meaning is up to us.
Inscrutability doesn't rattle Blain-Cruz, who has always been drawn, she said, to "dense, weird, fun, strange worlds." (She's also directed plays by Suzan-Lori Parks, Alice Birch and Branden Jacobs-Jenkins, so that checks out.) Besides, worrying too much about the enigmas of "Fefu" risks ignoring the elements that make it so pleasurable -- its charm, its humor, its sense of play.
"Once you hear it in conversation, all of a sudden it becomes alive and understandable," Blain-Cruz said. That was true in the rehearsal room, even as the women were working through a dense passage drawn from a 1917 handbook on theater in education.
For Blain-Cruz, the play is "about discovering the many worlds that exist within eight different women and what happens when they orbit and bounce against each other." Fornés went back and forth about whether she considered the play feminist, but she did say, unequivocally, "The play is about women."
I had begun to wonder if that was what made the play so subversive, so apparently unstageable. Not its five separate sets, not its ethical inquiry, but the fact that it invites these women over and encourages them to speak to each other.
Two days after I visited rehearsal, I called Jeffrey Horowitz, the founder of Theater for a New Audience, the producers of this revival, and I asked him why the play was so rarely performed. "I don't know," he said. A few minutes after our call ended, my phone rang. Horowitz again. He had an answer. "I think it's because she writes about women," he said.
Robinson had told me something similar. "It's important not to overlook questions of bias," he said.
That day in rehearsal, thinking about how good and weird it felt to see so many women onstage, I asked Blain-Cruz if that aspect of the play still felt radical.
"Deeply," she said, laughing the way you laugh when you could just as easily scream or cry. "Deeply. Oh, look -- eight women in a room. Explosive!"

Paul Krugman: Trump and his party of pollution

Texto completo: Given what we’ve seen in the impeachment hearings so far, there is literally no crime, no abuse of power, that would induce Republicans to turn on President Donald Trump. So if you’re waiting for some dramatic political turn, don’t hold your breath.
On second thought, however, maybe you should hold your breath. For air quality has deteriorated significantly over the past few years — a deterioration that has already cost thousands of American lives. And if Trump remains in power, the air will get much worse, and the death toll rise dramatically, in the years ahead.
The story so far: When I talk about air pollution, I don’t mean the greenhouse gases that are driving climate change, which pose a long-term existential threat. I’m talking instead about pollutants that have a much more immediate effect, especially “fine particulate matter,” small particles that make the air hazy and can penetrate deep into the respiratory tract. The health hazards of these particles have been documented by many studies.
The good news until a few years ago was that thanks to environmental regulation the concentration of fine particulates was in fairly rapid decline. The bad news is that since 2016 this kind of pollution has been on the rise again, reversing around a fifth of the gains since 2009.
A study documenting this reversal suggests multiple causes, including wildfires (themselves caused in part by climate change), increased driving and reduced enforcement. The study also finds, using well-established results on the health effects of pollution, that even this seemingly small rise in particulates led to almost 10,000 extra deaths last year.
To put this number in context, it may be helpful to remember that Trump began his presidency by talking about “American carnage,” portraying a nation awash in violent crime. In reality, crime was and is near historic lows. To the extent that anything was behind his rant, it lay in a modest (and temporary) uptick in homicides from around 14,000 in 2014 to 17,000 in 2016.
The point is that the Trump-era death toll from worsening air is already several times as large as the “carnage” Trump decried.
It seems crass to point this out, but the economic cost of rising pollution is also large; the study puts it at $89 billion a year. This is a pretty big number, even in an economy as large as America’s, and it means that economic growth under Trump, properly measured, has been significantly slower than standard numbers suggest.
And things are poised to get much worse. The Trump administration is working on new rules that would effectively prevent the Environmental Protection Agency from making use of much of the scientific evidence on adverse health effects of pollution. This would cripple environmental regulation, almost surely leading to sharply worsening air and water quality over time.
We don’t know exactly how this will play out, but it seems safe to say that if Trump stays in office, a lot more Americans will die as a result of his anti-environmental policies than the total number who are murdered, let alone murdered by the immigrants Trump loves to portray as a menacing, dark-skinned horde.
Why is this happening? As many observers have pointed out, failing to act on climate change, although it’s an indefensible crime against humanity, is also in some ways understandable. Greenhouse gas emissions are invisible, and the harm they do is global and very long term, making denialism relatively easy.
Particulates, however, are visible, and the harm they do is both relatively localized and fairly quick. So you might have thought that the fight against dirty air would have widespread, bipartisan support. Indeed, modern environmental protection began under none other than Richard Nixon, and retired EPA officials I’ve talked to describe the Nixon era as a golden age.
And Republicans continued to show at least some concern for the environment even after the party began to take a hard right turn. President Ronald Reagan signed a treaty to protect the ozone layer. The threat of acid rain was contained via a program enacted by President George H.W. Bush.
But that was a long time ago. Today’s Republican Party isn’t just a party that has embraced crazy conspiracy theories about global warming (and everything else where the facts are inconvenient.) It has also become the party of pollution.
Why? Follow the money. There’s huge variation among industries in how much environmental damage they do per dollar of production. And the super-polluting industries have basically put all their chips on the Republicans. In 2016, for example, coal mining gave 97% of its political contributions to Republican candidates and causes. And polluters are getting what they paid for.
This, by the way, is one reason I and others find it so mind-boggling when people like Joe Biden say that everything will be fine once Trump is gone. If Trump doesn’t succeed in destroying our democracy (a big if), his most damaging legacy will be the vast environmental destruction he leaves behind. And Trump’s pro-pollution stance isn’t an aberration. In this, he is very much a man of his party.

Texto completo: Sally Roesch Wagner is honored to be in the "illustrious" company of the many authors whose books have been hidden by the mysterious Coeur d'Alene Public Library "book bandit."
For months, that bandit has been randomly reshelving and otherwise concealing books that seemed to oppose the worldview of President Donald Trump or that discussed LGBTQ rights and a woman's right to vote - books like "Fear" by Bob Woodward and "Hard Choices" by Hillary Clinton.
Also gone missing was Roesch Wagner's "The Women's Suffrage Movement."
Library Director Bette Ammon started to notice a trend as shelvers found the books placed in obscure corners of the library.
The bandit's behavior has drawn the attention of media near and far. And when Roesch Wagner saw a New York Times article about the library's mysterious book mover just a few days before she was scheduled to speak at Gonzaga University for its year-long celebration of the centennial of the 19th Amendment's passage, her curiousity was piqued.
So Roesch Wagner headed to Coeur d'Alene to see what was going on.
"I actually really wanted to go over to the library and visit the librarian, and thank her for holding up the badge of courage and making sure that all viewpoints are represented in the library," Roesch Wagner said.
The women got to talking about why the suffrage movement was something this person wanted hidden.
"The connective tissue in all of these books is that they all are challenging the status quo in some way," Roesch Wagner said.
But finding the connection wasn't enough for Roesch Wagner. She didn't want to make assumptions - she wanted to know what this person was really thinking. So she hatched a plan.
"I wrote a note to the person that's hiding the books and said that I would really welcome a conversation with them," Roesch Wagner said. "It would mean a lot to me to know why they want people not to read my book."
That note can be found in the library's copy of Roesch Wagner's book.
She even promised not to reveal the person's identity if they reached out to her and had a conversation.
"I mean that very sincerely, of having that conversation and really listening to this person," Roesch Wagner said. "They've obviously gone to a lot of thought and a lot of, really, planning and thinking through what books they find dangerous. And in an odd kind of way, I respect that."
She hopes to find a human connection with the person hiding the books and to learn about the person's perspective.
"We're at such an impasse culturally with 'us and them' and demonizing people that think differently than we do. I don't want to demonize this person. I really want to understand them," Roesch Wagner said. "I hope I hear from them."
Working to understand a wide-array of perspectives is something Roesch Wagner has practice doing. In her book, she recognizes indigenous women's political power and how the American Women's Suffrage movement had racial undertones.
"Native women have had political voice on this land for 1,000 years at least, while we're in the United States celebrating 100 years of women having political voice," Roesch Wagner said. "That in itself says that there's some people around here who may have something worth listening to."
The book also criticizes what she considers half-measures, like the American Woman Suffrage Association appealing to white supremacists in the South with the idea that white women outnumbered African Americans and immigrants, Roesch Wagner explained.
"When you don't work for the good of everybody, you create divisions and those divisions continue today," Roesch Wagner said.
However, Roesch Wagner was hesitant to link those divisions to the book bandit.
"I wish I knew what the book hiding was an example of," Roesch Wagner said. "I don't know what the motive is of the person doing it. It does seem to be targeting things that challenge the status quo, but I'm not sure I can assume much more than that, without having an opportunity to talk to them."
While no one can say for sure what the book-hider hopes to accomplish, Ammon did share her perspective after not only witnessing the book-hiding but receiving a note from the person last year.
"The message they gave us a year ago (was) that they were trying to protect young people from seeing things that were against the president and obviously on a number of other topics," Ammon said. "I think that's where it comes from. And I think often people, when they try to keep other people from reading something, it comes from a pretty pure motive like that."
No matter what the motive, fighting censorship is a mission of libraries and librarians everywhere, Ammon said.
"It's a trust that librarians and libraries hold dearly, that they resist censorship and say to people that they are fine to read this book or not and you can choose for yourself and your family, but you just can't choose for other people," Ammon said.
Other authors have engaged with the library and the book bandit, including Rick Reilly, author of "Commander in Cheat: How Golf Explains Trump," who will speak at the library on Nov. 21.
Roesch Wagner heard that Reilly plans to "repopulate" the library by donating 10 copies of his book to be hidden throughout the shelves.
She plans to provide copies of her book as well, and sees the idea as a way to play with what the book bandit is doing.
"It's kind of a way of taking the - I don't know if you call it humorous - but the sort of creative part of what this book-hider is doing, and playing with it, you know," Roesch Wag-ner said. "It takes some of the sharp edge off."

Texto completo: Adam Schefter, the most influential reporter covering America's favorite game, called the nationally televised assault, "unthinkable and unimaginable."
It wasn't.
What would be unthinkable and unimaginable would be attempting to explain this -- any single aspect of it -- to someone who has not spent a lifetime normalizing such absurdity.
What would be unthinkable and unimaginable is a spaceship landing in your driveway Thurs Thursday night, an alien plopping down on your couch, pointing to the TV and asking, "What's that?"
"Thursday Night Football," you answer after gathering your wits.
"That's football?"
Well, sort of. See that yellow flag on the field? Johnson's team will be rewarded for becoming the victim of that violent hit. And Randall got ejected. So, that makes things mostly square. It's a physical game. Not for the weak. Play should resume soon.
"Who is that wearing No. 19?"
JuJu Smith-Schuster. He's a wide receiver for the Steelers. Why?
"If that hit by Randall was not allowed, where was the flag when two Browns players ran headfirst into Smith-Schuster?"
Not sure. This game has been awfully chippy. Sometimes penalties are missed.
"Why was Randall smiling after he hurt Johnson?"
He was? I must have missed it. Pass the popcorn. It's the fluffy white stuff in the bowl. Try some. It's good.
"Is that football?"
No! Absolutely not. That can't happen. Shameful. Awful. Garrett is in big trouble. But, you know, Rudolph did reach for Garrett's helmet first. And when that happens, a fight is bound to happen. That's the point O.J. Simpson made on Twitter.
"Who is O.J. Simpson?"
Long story. Forget it. Let's watch the replay of the fight.
"Is that football?"
Well, no. But Pouncey is protecting his quarterback. That's a critical rule in football. Pouncey is just being a good teammate. He deserves credit for that. Garrett is the bad guy here. Ogunjobi is the second-worst. Rudolph gets a pass. Pouncey is a hero. It's obvious.
"Who's that?"
That's Browns quarterback Baker Mayfield doing a postgame interview. He's saying what Garrett did was wrong. That's pretty controversial, what Mayfield just said. Some people won't like that.
"Why? Did anyone think what Garrett did was right?"
Not really, no. But some will say Mayfield should have dodged the question to protect his teammate. Some will say he should have mentioned that Rudolph played a role in the fight. Mayfield is being very brave. Look at all of the praise he's getting on Twitter.
"What's Twitter?"
Never mind.
"Does this kind of stuff always happen in football?"
Goodness, no. I mean, it's happened often enough that there is a rule against using the helmet as a weapon. But it hasn't happened like this since, well, August, when Kyle Long ripped off a rookie's helmet and hit him with it during a training-camp brawl. And there was that time Antonio Smith swung a helmet at Richie Incognito, but he mostly missed. Another time, Andre Johnson and Cortland Finnegan ripped each other's helmets off and traded punches. And then there was that time Albert Haynesworth took off Andre Gurode's helmet and stomped on his head. Gurode needed 30 stitches. Haynesworth was suspended for five games. Want to see the video? It's wild.
"No, thanks. Was that the worst thing Haynesworth did?"
Well, no.
"Was he arrested?"
Haynesworth?
"No, Garrett."
No, but he has been suspended. For sure. The NFL takes this stuff very seriously. The Browns have six games left. Garrett won't play in any of them.
"How long is the season?"
Sixteen games. Then the playoffs. A six-game suspension would be huge by NFL standards. The league doesn't care if its players become brain-scrambled zombies after they retire, but it does care about making a statement in situations like this. Stuff like this is starting to bother people.
"Does it bother you?"
What?
"Do your children watch this?"
"Do they play football?"
"Should they?"
Hey, cool it man -- I mean, alien. Football's got some problems. It's not perfect. I get it. But it's still America's game. Sure, some players are starting to retire in their prime, and The New York Times reported the high school participation rate in 11-man football has dropped more than 10 percent since 2009.
But what would we do without football? Every game is not like this one. Promise. Come back Sunday and find out for yourself.
"There is another game on Sunday?"
There are 12.

Trump Jr. wraps up book tour Author defends father, attacks impeachment

Texto completo: Donald Trump Jr. finished his 10-day multi-city book tour on Friday the way he began, with a defense of his father and an attack on the impeachment investigation. There was one twist: The finale was in the most Democratic place in Florida, Broward County.
He found refuge from the South Florida majority on the 15th floor of a downtown Fort Lauderdale office tower, where he extolled the virtues of his book, "Triggered: How the Left Thrives on Hate and Wants to Silence Us," and of his father, President Donald Trump.
Trump Jr. decried the impeachment inquiry as "100% partisan hackery."
"Americans see this as the kangaroo court that it is," he said. "This isn't even American. If this was going on in any other country in the world, we'd be disgusted and we'd be writing outraged articles about it. But it is happening right here in this country in 2019."
Asked by the host, Ed Pozzuoli, CEO of the Tripp Scott law firm, what Republicans can do to keep Florida Republican next year, Trump didn't offer a specific strategy. "Watch the cheating. In all fairness, each and every time there's a problem, it all stems right here."
(While Florida elections, including last year's, have experienced multiple problems, there hasn't been evidence of or prosecutions for cheating. Since 2002, Florida elections have been overseen by secretaries of state, all of whom have been appointed by Republican governors.)
Trump brought up the controversy surrounding his book sales, bragging about landing this week at the top of the New York Times bestseller list. "I would have given any amount of money to be in the room when the New York Times had to make me No. 1."
But the ranking is controversial because it comes with a notation that it includes bulk purchases, something the book world views as a shady way to make a book seem as if it's doing better than it really is. Trump argued that even with the purchase of 10,000 copies by the Republican National Committee, his sales were double the number of the No. 2 book.
By Trump's reckoning, things are going so well in the country and his father is doing such good job that "2020 should be over," with a re-election.
Trump was at times in full-on attack mode during the 37 minutes he spoke and answered questions:
* Congressional Democrats, he asserted, don't want to do anything that could be seen as a Trump victory. "Do they dislike Trump or hate Trump so much more than they like America or Americans?"
* Robert Mueller, the special counsel who led the probe into Russian meddling into the 2016 election, was too out of it to understand what was going on in the investigation he was ostensibly leading, he said. Pointing to Mueller's sometimes halting congressional testimony, he described the former special counsel as "a couple of decades past his prime."
* The news media "is basically one in the same" as the political left. "The media are the marketing wing for the Democratic Party."
* Joe Biden's use of a teleprompter (which President Trump sometimes uses) shows the former vice president isn't up to running for president. "If he's using teleprompters after being a 50-year career politician to talk to a group of 20 people, how are you going to do against Trump one-on-one for six months Joe? It's going to be awesome."
He was also, at times, funny, as when he described his inability to stop live tweeting when Mueller testified before Congress. "I have Tourette's of the thumbs, which is an inherited trait I am told."
Trump also showed some of the same fascination his father has with Elton John. The president has frequently compared his crowd sizes to John's concerts. Trump Jr. described his book sales as "about the same as Elton John did in his autobiography."
Trump was accompanied by his girlfriend, the former Fox News personality Kimberly Guilfoyle. "I affectionately call her my Puerto Rican knife fighter," he said.
"I said 'princess' too," he added.
She stood by him when he signed books, bought by the law firm for many of the 170 or so people who attended. She picked up each one from the stack, opened it, slid it to Trump, who scrawled a signature - with his father's favorite writing implement, a Sharpie pen.
Guilfoyle was outspoken during earlier book tour stops, including the two that generated the most attention, a combative appearance on the daytime TV show "The View" and an event at U.C.L.A. where conservative students shouted down the couple. On Friday she didn't say much, though she joked that she'd actually written her boyfriend's book.
Trump boasted that his appearances on "The View" generated outraged reactions that he said helped book sales. "I owned outrage last week. It was awesome."
Friday's invitation-only event was part of Tripp Scott's "Politics & Sunshine" series. Though the firm was founded and is led by prominent Republicans, it includes Democratic attorneys and periodically brings in speakers from both sides of the political aisle.
Pozzuoli said Trump was invited to give insight to interested clients, attorneys and staff. "Look at the headlines," he said. "It is timely."
Rick Fairchild of Vero Beach said he found Trump interesting. "He's a better communicator than I realized."
Clarence McKee, a Coral Springs communications consultant, said Trump hit a home run. "As a communicator, a triple plus," he said. "Passion, honesty - and we're going to kick the hell out of you."

Save Earth’s little things and you save us all, including the Joshua tree

Texto completo: Just as, when feeling a great urge to see your taxes cut, you don’t turn to the president pro tempore of the California state Senate to get the job done tout de suite, you don’t look for help saving all creatures wise and wonderful, including ourselves, by asking a species denier for help.
You know who I mean when I say species denier. It’s the people who howl bloody human murder whenever environmentalists try to protect some little flora or fauna they have never heard of, or can’t eat.
The delta smelt is the great California example. Who gives a damn, goes the denier logic, about a little fish nobody in their right non-ichthyologic mind has ever heard of, and that even the enviros have a hard time finding one example of?
Yes, the delta smelt is very tiny. And it has held up much transfer of water from north to south in a vast state, as have other ecological considerations. I wouldn’t recognize one if it happened to swim by. But thank all that is good for the people who would, and who understand that by saving the little things, we save the rest of us well.
I was thinking of this plain fact recently when considering the possible loss of the Joshua trees in our desert because of climate change. Unlike the delta smelt, everyone loves a Joshua tree. We have a whole national park that celebrates them. So many of us, including the species deniers — the kind who claim they wouldn’t miss a smelt or two, or, on the flora side, some weed or another, I suppose — would miss them.
And yet, as our staff writer Matt Kristoffersen reported in August: “Because of climate change, however, roughly 80% of the habitat for the famous plants in Joshua Tree National Park might not survive past 2100 — and that’s being optimistic, UC Riverside scientists conclude in a new study. Researchers at UCR’s Center for Conservation Biology, among other institutes, published the study in June in the journal Ecosphere. It confirms what scientists said years ago in previous studies: the trees’ fate is in the hands of humans.”
They are beloved despite what a National Park Service guide given out at the park calls “their grotesque appearance.” Yucca brevifolia is a member of the agave family. As in tequila. It’s very hard to estimate their age: “They’re yucca plants, so they don’t grow with rings, like a tree, so you can’t count their age that way,” a former ranger told The New York Times. “All we can do is make estimates.”
They grow about half an inch inch to three inches annually, so tree people use a Joshua tree’s height to guess its age. The tallest ones in the park are about 40 feet. They may therefore be about 150 years old, though no one knows.
And if climate change continues at the accelerating rate that it is, the 160,000 acres across the park that have supported Joshua trees since before humans lived here could fall to just 37 acres by 2100. Because it’s getting hotter, and drier, and they won’t make it if we keep going as we are.
I grew up camping and climbing and staring at the Joshua trees there, as my parents did before me, as my daughter has done after. I want the great-grandkids to have the same chance.
Told of that news, Kathryn Phillips, the director of Sierra Club California — also a former reporter here — said: “When I hear stuff like that, it motivates me. I’m not the kind of person that wants to roll up into a fetal position and cry. I want to take action and fight back.”
If you are worried that perhaps you are not concerned enough about the big things, find some little plant or critter to worry about. Help protect it. Then we big things can ride on its coattails.

Texto completo: Just as, when feeling a great urge to see your taxes cut, you don’t turn to the president pro tempore of the California state Senate to get the job done tout de suite, you don’t look for help saving all creatures wise and wonderful, including ourselves, by asking a species denier for help.
You know who I mean when I say species denier. It’s the people who howl bloody human murder whenever environmentalists try to protect some little flora or fauna they have never heard of, or can’t eat.
The delta smelt is the great California example. Who gives a damn, goes the denier logic, about a little fish nobody in their right non-ichthyologic mind has ever heard of, and that even the enviros have a hard time finding one example of?
Yes, the delta smelt is very tiny. And it has held up much transfer of water from north to south in a vast state, as have other ecological considerations. I wouldn’t recognize one if it happened to swim by. But thank all that is good for the people who would, and who understand that by saving the little things, we save the rest of us well.
I was thinking of this plain fact recently when considering the possible loss of the Joshua trees in our desert because of climate change. Unlike the delta smelt, everyone loves a Joshua tree. We have a whole national park that celebrates them. So many of us, including the species deniers — the kind who claim they wouldn’t miss a smelt or two, or, on the flora side, some weed or another, I suppose — would miss them.
And yet, as our staff writer Matt Kristoffersen reported in August: “Because of climate change, however, roughly 80% of the habitat for the famous plants in Joshua Tree National Park might not survive past 2100 — and that’s being optimistic, UC Riverside scientists conclude in a new study. Researchers at UCR’s Center for Conservation Biology, among other institutes, published the study in June in the journal Ecosphere. It confirms what scientists said years ago in previous studies: the trees’ fate is in the hands of humans.”
They are beloved despite what a National Park Service guide given out at the park calls “their grotesque appearance.” Yucca brevifolia is a member of the agave family. As in tequila. It’s very hard to estimate their age: “They’re yucca plants, so they don’t grow with rings, like a tree, so you can’t count their age that way,” a former ranger told The New York Times. “All we can do is make estimates.”
They grow about half an inch inch to three inches annually, so tree people use a Joshua tree’s height to guess its age. The tallest ones in the park are about 40 feet. They may therefore be about 150 years old, though no one knows.
And if climate change continues at the accelerating rate that it is, the 160,000 acres across the park that have supported Joshua trees since before humans lived here could fall to just 37 acres by 2100. Because it’s getting hotter, and drier, and they won’t make it if we keep going as we are.
I grew up camping and climbing and staring at the Joshua trees there, as my parents did before me, as my daughter has done after. I want the great-grandkids to have the same chance.
Told of that news, Kathryn Phillips, the director of Sierra Club California — also a former reporter here — said: “When I hear stuff like that, it motivates me. I’m not the kind of person that wants to roll up into a fetal position and cry. I want to take action and fight back.”
If you are worried that perhaps you are not concerned enough about the big things, find some little plant or critter to worry about. Help protect it. Then we big things can ride on its coattails.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION AIMS TO LET PATIENTS SEE CARE COSTS AHEAD OF TIME: The Trump administration unveiled long-awaited healthcare cost transparency policies on Friday.
One part of the plan is a proposed rule would require health plans to allow patients to view the costs they would be responsible for paying to undergo a procedure or receive care in a hospital. Insurers would also have to make public the costs of services after they have negotiated prices with hospitals. Plans would also have to show patients what their estimated costs would be for out-of-network care.
Another part of the plan, a finalized rule, will require hospitals to publish standard charges for services, including procedures and prescription drugs administered in the hospital. The rule will go into effect Jan. 1, 2021.
The administration is saying that Friday’s effort is the biggest action it’s taken yet related to healthcare.
“Today’s transparency announcement may be a more significant change to American healthcare markets than any other single thing we’ve done, by shining light on the costs of our shadowy system and finally putting the American patient in control,” Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said in introducing the plan.
Seema Verma, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services administrator, said the rule will allow patients to compare prices of certain services at various hospitals, including x-rays, lab tests, and C-sections, thus increasing competition.
Hospitals and insurers generally do not disclose prices of procedures. They are likely to fight the new rules in court, but Azar said that “we feel we are on a very sound legal footing with what we’re asking.”
President Trump will expound on the rules at 2 p.m. Friday in the Roosevelt Room. Read more about the proposed and finalized rules here.

A LOT OF MEDICARE HOSPICE PATIENTS AREN’T BEING VISITED BY STAFF BEFORE THEY DIE: It appears that many Medicare hospice patients are being left alone and not getting care in their last days. That’s one of the main findings in a new Government Accountability Office report, requested by Democrat Ron Wyden, which found 83 providers, 80 for-profits and 3 non-profits, that did not have hospice staff visit beneficiaries within the last three days of their life.
“Americans at the end of life and their families expect the best care possible — it’s unacceptable that too often hospice providers are falling short,” the Oregon senator said in a comment on the report. His office said too that the report finds generally that for-profit hospices are more likely to have worse outcomes.
VAPING-RELATED LUNG INJURIES REACH ANOTHER RECORD HIGH: As of Nov. 13, 2,172 cases of lung injuries linked to vaping have been confirmed, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The death toll has also risen to 42.
PALLONE PUSHES FOR INVESTIGATION INTO JUUL FOR SELLING CONTAMINATED PODS: Democrat Frank Pallone urged Acting Commissioner Brett P. Giroir of the Food and Drug Administration to open an investigation into Juul Labs for allegedly selling mint-flavored pods that they knew were contaminated and expired. Pallone said: “It is imperative that [FDA] investigate this allegation regarding contaminated products on the market if it has not yet done so.”
Whistleblower Siddharth Breja, previously Juul’s senior vice president for global finance, testified in a Northern District of California suit that Juul was trying to make up for lost sales after having to take flavors like mango and cucumber off the market last fall, and soon enough consumers started buying so many mint pods that demand outstripped supply. Juul allegedly shipped about 1 million contaminated or expired pods to retailers, and didn’t recall them when the company learned they were contaminated in March. Breja said he suggested to Juul executives that they either recall the pods or place a “best by” date on packaging, but they declined. Breja was fired soon after.
MAYBE SMOKING CIGARETTES ISN’T COOL AFTER ALL: The share of adults who smoke cigarettes has hit an all-time low of 13.7%, according to new Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data. Not only is that the lowest it has ever been, it’s a two-thirds decline since the Surgeon General’s first warning about negative health effects of smoking over 50 years ago.
EVEN BABIES ARE EATING TOO MUCH SUGAR: Nearly all toddlers (98.3%) and most infants (60.6%) consume added sugar on a given day, according to a new government study —which they shouldn’t be per recommendations.
“The most important thing to take away is that added sugars are everywhere,” Kirsten Herrick of the National Cancer Institute’s cancer control and population sciences division told the New York Times.
The study, based on CDC data, concludes that infants are mostly getting the added sugars from yogurt, baby food snacks/sweets, and sweet bakery products.

To lower costs, Trump administration to force hospitals to reveal price of care

Texto completo: The Trump administration on Friday said it would begin forcing hospitals to publicly disclose the discounted prices they negotiate with insurance companies, aiming to help people shop for better deals on a range of medical services, from hip replacements to brain scans.
The federal rule, part of a broader push to make health care markets more transparent to patients, would not take effect until 2021, however. The administration also unveiled a proposed rule to require insurers to allow patients to get advanced estimates of their out-of-pocket costs before they see a doctor or go to the hospital.
The hospital industry, which has long kept these rates secret, will almost certainly challenge the rule in court.
President Donald Trump was expected to hold a briefing Friday afternoon to discuss the new rules, which the administration hopes will make the health care markets work better by making information about prices more accessible to patients.
The new rule requires hospitals to make a range of prices easily available. Those costs include negotiated prices when they are part of an insurer’s network, what they are paid if the care is out-of-network and even what the hospital would accept for the treatment if paid in cash.
“American patients have been at the mercy of a shadowy system,” said Alex M. Azar II, the secretary of health and human services, said in a news conference Friday. “This shadowy system has to change.”
“Today’s transparency announcement may be a more significant change to American health care markets than any other single thing we’ve done,” Azar said in a statement.
Administration officials, employers and others have criticized hospitals and insurers for keeping the deals they strike a secret, making it challenging for patients to seek less expensive places to get care. They argue that by making it easier for people to find the actual prices that insurers pay — and not just the standard list prices for various services, which the Trump administration started requiring hospitals to post earlier this year — hospitals will be under more pressure to compete on prices.
The proposal, if implemented, has the potential to roil the health care industry, which critics argue use the secrecy of their negotiations to keep prices high. A recent study showed some hospitals are paid two to three times by private insurers what the federal Medicare program pays for the same care. Even employers say they have little visibility into the prices being paid by the insurers on behalf of their workers.
Both the hospitals and health insurers say they should not be required to make public what they consider proprietary information, and they are expected to mount legal challenges to any mandated disclosure. In Ohio, a state law requiring price transparency that was passed two years ago is still stuck in the courts.
Both the hospitals and insurers argue that disclosing prices would lead to higher costs, not lower ones, because each institution would know the prices of its competitors and could be reluctant to settle for less.
“This is a canard,” Azar responded, adding that he believed the lack of transparency in the market has clearly led to higher prices.
If the rule is challenged, it is not clear how successful the administration will be in making its case. Another attempt to create transparency — a requirement that pharmaceutical companies disclose the list price of their drugs in their television ads — has been put on hold by the courts. A federal judge ruled last summer that the Department of Health and Human Services exceeded its regulatory authority with the rule, which was seen as largely symbolic since list prices are not what patients typically pay.
“We may face litigation, and we feel we are on a very firm legal footing,” said Azar, who emphasized the information is already being made public to patients on what is called an explanation of benefits form — but after they go to the doctor or get a medical treatment.

Texto completo: Plastic waste from America, collected for recycling, is shipped to Indonesia. Some is burned as fuel by tofu makers, producing deadly chemicals and contaminating food.
TROPODO, Indonesia -- Black smoke billows from smokestacks towering above the village. The smell of burning plastic fills the air. Patches of black ash cover the ground. It's another day of making tofu.
More than 30 commercial kitchens in Tropodo, a village on the eastern side of Indonesia's main island, Java, fuel their tofu production by burning a mix of paper and plastic waste, some of it shipped from the United States after Americans dumped it in their recycling bins.
The backyard kitchens produce much of the area's tofu, an inexpensive and high-protein food made from soy that is an important part of the local diet. But the smoke and ash produced by the burning plastic has far-reaching and toxic consequences.
Testing of eggs laid by chickens in Tropodo, a village of 5,000 people, found high levels of several hazardous chemicals including dioxin -- a pollutant known to cause cancer, birth defects and Parkinson's disease -- according to a report released this week by an alliance of Indonesian and international environmental groups.
The dioxin found in Tropodo is the end product in a chain of malfeasance, carelessness and governmental neglect.
"They start the burning early in the morning and go until evening," said Karnawi, 84, who lives near seven of the plastic-burning commercial kitchens. "It happens every day and the smoke is always in the air. For me, it's difficult to breathe." Like many Indonesians, Mr. Karnawi uses only one name.
An egg laid by one of Mr. Karnawi's chickens had one of the highest levels of dioxin ever recorded in Asia, the report found.
The levels of dioxin found in that egg were second only to eggs collected near Bien Hoa, Vietnam, the former United States air base that was a Vietnam War staging area for the defoliant Agent Orange, which contains dioxin. The United States recently began a 10-year, $ 390 million cleanup at Bien Hoa, which remains heavily contaminated nearly five decades after the war ended.
An adult who eats just one egg like the one taken from Mr. Karnawi's henhouse would exceed the United States daily safety threshold by nearly 25-fold and the stricter European Food Safety Authority standard by 70-fold.
Eggs are commonly used for testing contamination because chickens effectively sample the soil as they forage and toxins accumulate in their eggs.
"These stark findings illustrate the dangers of plastics for human health and should move policymakers to ban plastic waste combustion, address environmental contamination, and rigorously control imports," said Lee Bell, an adviser to the International Pollutants Elimination Network and a co-author of the report.
The study was conducted by four environmental groups: Ecoton and the Nexus3 Foundation, based in Indonesia; Arnika, based in Prague; and the International Pollutants Elimination Network or IPEN, a global network dedicated to eliminating toxic pollutants.
The toxins found in Tropodo's soil begin with Westerners believing they are doing a good thing for the environment -- sorting their waste for recycling. Much of that waste is sent abroad, including to Indonesia, where it is combined with local waste for processing.
But rather than being turned into new consumer goods like fleece jackets and sneakers, much of the waste is unusable for recycling and is instead thrown into the furnaces that fuel Tropodo's tofu boilers.
"This is plastic collected from consumers in the United States and other countries and burned to make tofu in Indonesia," said Yuyun Ismawati, a co-founder of the Nexus3 Foundation and a study co-author.
The amount of foreign waste coming to Indonesia soared two years ago after China halted trash imports.
In East Java, 11 paper mills operate south of Surabaya, Indonesia's second-largest city, and import waste paper for recycling.
Some unscrupulous foreign waste handlers dump unwanted plastic on the developing world by including as much as 50 percent plastic in their supposed paper shipments, Ms. Yuyun said. Local companies profit by accepting the shipments.
Much of the plastic is unwanted, low-grade material and Indonesia has no good way to dispose of it.
After removing the best materials for recycling, most companies send their remaining waste to Bangun, a village known for its trash pickers who hunt for items of value and material worth recycling.
In Bangun, piles of trash, some more than 15 feet high, fill every vacant bit of land. About 2,400 people live in the village and almost every family is involved in the waste business.
The trash pickers say they can tell that some shipments have come from the United States because of the writing on items they sort. Further indicating the origin of the waste, the pickers say they sometimes find accidentally discarded American dollars and broken liquor bottles with distinctively American labels, like Jack Daniels.
The final stop for the least wanted trash is Tropodo and its tofu makers.
Every day, trucks carry leftover scraps of paper and plastic 20 miles by road from Bangun to Tropodo and leave their loads outside the tofu kitchens.
"People need it as fuel for the tofu factories," said a truck driver, Fadil, 38, as he dumped his load on a village street. He said he had been delivering paper and plastic waste to the village's tofu makers for 20 years.
The open burning of trash -- including plastic -- is widespread throughout Indonesia. The practice is illegal but the law is seldom enforced.
Environmental activists say Indonesia's president, Joko Widodo, has neglected health concerns in pursuit of economic development and have urged him to address toxic contamination, including air pollution and mercury contamination.
In July, the Environment Ministry's director general for waste management, Rosa Vivien Ratnawati, visited Tropodo and acknowledged that the plastic burning was hazardous but made no attempt to halt it.
She told reporters that she would investigate how the toxic smoke could be controlled.
"If the plastic is used as fuel it is not a problem but the pollution should be managed," she said.
Since then, the government has taken no action.
Contacted last week by The New York Times, Ms. Ratnawati declined to discuss the issue and referred questions to the director general for environmental pollution, Karliansyah. He did not respond to inquiries from The Times.
Many of Tropodo's residents say they detest the plastic burning but are powerless to stop it.
The tofu makers -- a major employer in Tropodo -- switched to burning plastic from wood many years ago.
The kitchens operate every day, and when there is little wind the acrid smoke hangs over the village like a poisonous fog.
Nanang Zainuddin, 37, runs a small kitchen around the corner from Mr. Karanawi's henhouse. He says he burns plastic because it is cheaper, sometimes as little as a tenth of the cost of burning wood.
The process of making tofu starts with soaking and grinding soybeans, placing them in a concrete tub and injecting steam from a boiler that is fueled by burning plastic.
One worker tends the boiler and stuffs plastic into the fire while others steam the soybeans and skim off the pulp.
Mr. Nanang said that he disposes of the plastic ash by burying some and spreading more on the ground to create a level surface. He also gives some to neighbors so they can spread it over the soil around their homes.
"We are now standing on the ashes," he said as chickens and chicks scratched for food near his feet.
"Dioxin can come from anywhere," he added, "but if the government would like to resolve this, they are welcome."
The former mayor of Tropodo, Ismail, 50, a tofu producer himself, banned the use of plastic as fuel in 2014. But the prohibition lasted only a few months before the burning resumed.
His edict has been ignored ever since.
"There are many tofu makers here and most of them do not care," said Mr. Ismail, who uses mostly wood and some plastic as his fuel. "The tofu makers only count the profit, profit, profit. They don't count the disadvantages created by this business."

Texto completo: So many evangelicals doubted the sincerity of Kanye West’s exuberant embrace of Christianity on his new, long-awaited album, JESUS IS KING, that he incorporated their criticism into a track. “They’ll be the first one to judge me,” he raps in "Hands On," “Make it feel like nobody love me.”
However, the criticism found on social media, in pulpits, and on television of West’s very public faith belies the reality that most people's religious journeys are nonlinear, whether they are famous or not. In fact, the faiths of West and two of the album’s main contributors perfectly demonstrate the Biblical parable of the sower found in Matthew 13.
Rappers Gene and Terrence Thornton rode a wave of fame as Clipse until they parted ways in 2009. This wasn’t due to a typical behind-the-music tale of acrimony and pettiness. Rather, the brothers, who went by the monikers Malice and Pusha-T, split when Malice committed his life to God.
Malice’s road to Damascus was rocky. In 1996, he and some friends were drinking in the middle of the street, a location chosen because of one guy’s ankle monitor restrictions. A stranger named Alberta Wilson stopped and told them that God had a plan for their lives. Malice made fun of the meddling woman. How did a virgin have a baby? Though he was drunk, he was still incredulous. He tried to dismiss her until another day.
“You might not have another day,” she said. Even though he was seeing double, he and his friend held hands in the middle of the street and drunkenly accepted Jesus Christ. When he sobered up, however, he didn’t immediately walk the straight and narrow. Instead, he wound up selling crack cocaine, cheating on his wife, and smoking a lot of pot as the rap duo Clipse continued to earn critical acclaim, including a Grammy nomination and tours with sars such as 50 Cent and Jay-Z. Only after Malice feared he’d contracted HIV did he finally relent and accept God’s call on his life.
When Malice read Ephesians 4:31, which instructs Christians to put away malice, bitterness, and strife, he transformed into “No Malice” and decided to walk away from his rap lifestyle.
The brothers announced solo careers.
No Malice rapped about God and redemption in comparatively small venues. PushaT signed with Kanye’s label and went on to significant fame and wealth. He rapped about God, but in a markedly different way. His track "New God Flow begins", "I believe there’s a God above me, I’m just the god of everything else." His divine flippancy and drug-soaked lyrics took him to the top of the charts.
Though Kanye wanted to bring No Malice back into their creative loop, the latter's conscience wouldn’t allow it. “As far as me facilitating anything that brings death, destruction, and demise,” No Malice told XXL magazine, “I’m not going to do that.”
Meanwhile, Kanye was having his own brush with the divine. His 2004 track Jesus Walks included the lyric, “God show me the way because the devil trying to break me down.” On his 2013 album Yeezus, Kanye favorably compared himself to Jesus in a lyric reminiscent of Pusha-T’s: “I know he’s the most high, but I am a close high.”
On 2016’s Life of Pablo, the singer compared himself to the Apostle Paul (San Pablo in Spanish) and included songs such as “Ultralight Beam.” That track includes two prayers: a child praying “we don’t want no devils in this house” and gospel singer Kirk Franklin’s petition, “Father, this is a prayer for everybody who feels they’re not good enough … for everybody who feels they’re too messed up.” Chance the Rapper chimed in with an allusion to the “pillar of salt” from Genesis 19:26.
On a different track called "FML", the Weeknd expressed a sentiment from Romans 7:15. Whereas Paul wrote, “I do not understand what I do. For what I want to do I do not do, but what I hate I do,” the Weeknd put it this way: “I always f--k my life up.”
“This is a gospel album,” Kanye insisted at the time. “A whole lot of cursing on it, but it’s still a gospel album.”
Evangelicals balked at Kanye’s expression of faith, noting that his personal life didn’t reflect the sort of holiness normally associated with a Christian walk of faith. But on JESUS IS KING, Kanye’s conversion, which had only been incrementally obvious, took a more dramatic turn. He considered dropping rap altogether, saying he had no idea how to incorporate his engulfing faith into his music.
He went to his old friend, No Malice, for advice. With credits on the albums Selah, Closed on Sunday, and Hands On, the Thornton brothers were musically reunited.
The spiritual journeys of these three men might have confused cultural observers, but their paths can be easily understood in light of Matthew 13.
In the parable of the sower, a farmer seems to sow seeds indiscriminately. Some of the seed falls on a path with no soil, some falls on rocky ground with little soil, some on soil that contains thorns, and some on rich, fertile soil. Jesus explains that the seed represents the Word of God and the ground represents the different conditions of the heart.
The lives of these three rappers demonstrate the baffling sovereignty of God in the process of salvation and the sometimes winding paths people take. Though the seed is sown to all, God alone controls the condition of the soil and therefore the receptivity toward the message. That means some people receive the gospel message happily, but don’t last, because their faith has no root. Others hear the Word but “the worries of this life and the deceitfulness of wealth choke the word, making it unfruitful.” But Jesus explains that the one “who hears the word and understands” will produce a crop.
Christianity is not genetic, as evangelical theologian Carl F. H. Henry said in Dr. Russell Moore’s book Onward. Messy conversions shouldn’t surprise us. “The leaders of the next generation might not be coming from the current evangelical establishment,” Henry said. “They are probably still pagans.”
A faith journey is a “journey” because it takes a person from one place to another. In contrast to the elite cynicism and mockery seen online and on social media, Christians should be inspired to see one of the most famous people in the world submitting himself to God in such a public way. But they so fear that the rocks and roots will inevitably choke Kanye’s faith, they themselves have become the rocks and the roots.
If the parable of the sower is true, an outside observer can’t predict the spiritual destiny of those who proclaim Christ or those who actively oppose Him. Sometimes, people give their faith up. Sometimes, it’s a three-steps-forward-two-steps-back process that might look clumsy, especially if people wrestle with God in public. Sometimes, people appear to be God-haunted for a period of time before they convert. Other times, the post-conversion sanctification process takes longer than many people believe it should.
Moore took this concept even further in a 2016 statement that now seems prescient: “The next Billy Graham might be passed out drunk in a fraternity house right now. The next Charles Spurgeon might be making posters for a Gay Pride March right now. The next Mother Teresa might be managing an abortion clinic right now.” He also noted, “The next Charles Wesley might be a misogynist, profanity-spewing hip-hop artist right now.”
Like all of us, Kanye, No Malice, and PushaT have meandering faith paths made of different soils. The response should not be finger wagging, an earnest yet sober hope that all of our paths will take us through Christ to God.

Texto completo: MCPHERSON — When Andrew Maraniss, a New York Times bestselling author, first came to McPherson for the first time, he couldn’t help but notice a giant mural painted outside of the McPherson Library. It was the “ McPherson Global Refiners” with the caption that says”1st Ever Olympic Basketball Champions—1936.” Once he saw the mural, he began working on his new book, “Games of Deception.”
“I thought that was something really cool to see something that happened in 1936 is still being celebrated in town,” Maraniss said. “It’s a pretty cool thing for a small town in the middle of Kansas mean so much to the history of basketball. It is where the Olympic basketball, the Dream Team, current players like Lebron James, Kevin Durant. They wouldn’t have the opportunity if not the guys from McPherson first.”
Maraniss is a visiting author at Vanderbilt University Athletics and a contributor to ESPN’s The Undefeated.com.Maraniss, born in Madison, Wisconsin but grew up mostly in Washington, D.C., is the son of David Maraniss, a Pulitzer Prize-winner and bestselling author in his own right.
While Maraniss came to Kansas to promote his other book, “Stronger Inside,” he wanted to learn more about the 1936 Olympic team. He went to Lawrence, where he got the chance to see Allen Fieldhouse for the first time. As a college basketball fan, Maraniss took a tour around the arena and noticed the original rules of basketball written by James Naismith himself, the inventor of the sport. That’s when Maraniss learned that Naismith, at 75 years old, lived to see his inventions in action during the Nazi Olympics. It was a story, Maraniss couldn’t pass on.
“I had no idea even what Olympics that was,” Maraniss said. “When I found out it was from the Nazi Olympics of ‘36, there was a really good story there. So that’s how I became interested.”
Maraniss returned to McPherson on Tuesday to promote “Games of Deception,” a true story about the creation of Olympic basketball in 1936, and how six of McPherson’s residents who worked in the oil refinery became gold medalist during the 1936 summer Olympics in Berlin, Germany.
Maraniss did some digging to get more information on Naismith. He went to different college campuses around the country in which Naismith had connections with, met family relatives of the McPherson Refiners that had letters, journals, and medals they keep in a display, and even spoke to some people who witnessed the ‘36 Olympics, searching for answers before he began writing his rough draft. It took Maraniss one year to finish the book. Some of the hidden gems included Joe Fortenberry, who played for the McPherson Oilers, was considered the first person to ever dunk a basketball in Madison Square Garden.
“Most people who don’t know — as much as we know about the game of basketball and love basketball, (they) don’t know how the Olympic basketball started,” Maraniss said.
“Games of Deception” has already been released. You can purchase it at your local library or Amazon.com.

You asked, we answered: The impeachment hearings

Texto completo: The impeachment inquiry is proceeding quickly, and it entered a new phase this week as the House Intelligence Committee began open hearings to question witnesses about President Trump's pressure on Ukraine to open investigations into his political rivals.
The Globe wanted to know: What questions do you have about the impeachment inquiry as it moves into this new phase? So we we sought out your thoughts, and we're answering some of your queries here. Have more questions? Ask away.
Questions have been edited for length and clarity.
What is the difference between bribery and extortion? We keep hearing these terms used interchangeably.
Federal bribery law bars officials from taking or soliciting bribes, while extortion laws bar people, including federal officials, from taking anything of value from another person by threatening that person, former federal prosecutor Renato Mariotti writes in Politico.
The reason people are hearing those terms tossed around is that there is an ongoing debate among Democrats about how to categorize exactly what Trump allegedly did in the Ukraine scandal — and how to connect that to the “treason, bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors" mentioned as reasons for impeachment in the Constitution.
Some see Trump as possibly breaking laws against bribery and extortion, as well as campaign finance chicanery, and obstruction of justice.
The New York Times reported Thursday that the word “bribery" is gaining momentum among Democrats, with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff both using it in recent days. The term has the advantage of being specifically included in the Constitution and not an undefined “high crime and misdemeanor."
But legal analysts also point out that not all impeachable offenses have to be crimes, arguing it's not necessary to strain to try to match Trump's actions exactly to the elements of a crime on the law books.
One other term that you may hear is “abuse of power," which is not a crime but has a certain ring to it.
Abuse of power is essentially “the illegitimate use of power legitimately bestowed on the individual by virtue of his office," Frank Bowman, a professor at the University of Missouri School of Law who is the author of “High Crimes and Misdemeanors: A History of Impeachment for the Age of Trump," wrote on justsecurity.org.
How many votes would be needed to impeach President Trump?
The House of Representatives can impeach the president by a simple majority vote. “The framers and ratifiers did not want to make impeachment too hard. Hard, but not too hard," Cass Sunstein, a professor at Harvard Law School, writes in “Impeachment: A Citizen's Guide."
If Trump is impeached in the House, the debate will move to the Senate, which will decide whether to remove him from office. In the Senate, the bar is higher. A two-thirds vote would be needed for the Senate to remove Trump.
The two-thirds requirement is an “important and strong safeguard," Sunstein writes, helping to make sure a president wouldn't have to exit office, unless there is “something close to a national consensus that he should do so."
Democrats won control of the House in the 2018 elections and there are currently 233 Democrats, 197 Republicans, and 1 independent in the House, with four vacancies. The House voted, 232-196, in late October to formalize the inquiry. No Republicans voted in favor. Two Democrats voted against. If Democrats are convinced that Trump should impeached, he will be impeached.
On the other hand, in the Senate, there are 45 Democrats, 53 Republicans, and 2 independents who caucus with the Democrats. Democrats would need to convince a significant number of Republican senators to get to a two-thirds majority and remove Trump. So far the Republicans have shown little sign of budging.
Why aren't the Bidens there to face questioning?
Under House Intelligence Committee rules, Republicans are allowed to call witnesses, with a subpoena if necessary. Representative Devin Nunes has called on Hunter Biden, but not his father, to testify.
But the majority has veto power over any witnesses the Republicans call. Though he has not yet explicitly rejected the request to call Biden's son, Schiff said in a letter that he would not allow the hearings “to serve as vehicles for any Member to carry out the same sham investigations into the Bidens."
Republicans want to bring Biden's son before a committee to bring unflattering attention to his board seat on a Ukrainian energy company at the time his father was vice president, but there's no evidence that either Biden engaged in any wrongdoing.
Did Mr. Schiff and his staff misstate their relations to the whistle-blower? Why can't the guy who pulled the fire alarm testify?
House Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff said “we have not spoken directly with the whistle-blower," but an official told USA Today that Schiff “could have been more clear."
A House Intelligence Committee aide was among the officials the whistle-blower reached out to, in addition to a CIA lawyer. Schiff aides advised the whistle-blower to go through proper channels, according to the New York Times, which meant filing a complaint with the inspector general, who would then determine if it was credible and urgent. And that's what the whistle-blower did.
Schiff says he hasn't spoken to the whistle-blower himself, and doens't know his identity.
Now to whether he can testify: Under federal law, if a federal employee “pulls the fire alarm" through official channels rather than leaking to reporters, they are entitled to certain protections, including, to a limited extent, anonymity.
But this issue is murky. According to the New York Times, it does not appear to be illegal for Trump to out the whistle-blower, but the whistle-blower is legally protected from retaliation from his superiors, who include Trump. Lawyers for the whistle-blower say that he fears he would be put in danger if his identity was made public.

Texto completo: Around 2 a.m., in the waning hours of the final day of the legislative session, a group of lawmakers sat with the governor in her office in Augusta and looked over a bill, LD 1529, one more time. It had already passed the Maine House and Maine Senate, but Gov. Janet Mills had some concerns.
The legislation arguably went the furthest of the handful of bills targeting sexual harassment in the workplace that have passed the Maine Legislature in recent years. It would fundamentally alter the route many employers take to protect themselves against claims of discrimination by prohibiting them from requiring employees to sign confidentially agreements when negotiating monetary settlements or as a condition of employment.
In a rare move, the people in the room agreed to pause the bill's enactment. But it's coming back this session and appears poised to pass. If it does, it could reshape business practices and prompt more employees -- mainly women -- to talk publicly about experiencing sexual misconduct in the workplace.
Nondisclosure agreements gained more scrutiny in the wake of the #MeToo movement, and after The New York Times and The New Yorker published their investigations in October 2017 into sexual harassment and rape allegations against former Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein. The stories uncovered how Weinstein paid multiple women who claimed abuse in exchange for their silence. While the legally binding contracts are not new, the journalism showed how they made it possible for his alleged behavior to continue. 
By signing the agreements, aggrieved parties agree not to file a lawsuit against their employer, discuss the details of what happened or publicize the monetary award. If they violate the terms of the deal, the employer can recover damages.
LD 1529 would make nondisclosure agreements in the workplace possible only if employees want them, such as to protect their privacy. The legislation does not aim to ban them but to forbid employers from imposing them. The bill would give alleged victims 21 days to think over the agreements and, after signing, at least seven days to revoke them.
No one officially testified in opposition to the bill, though the Maine State Chamber of Commerce raised concerns in its testimony in April before the Legislature's labor panel, saying it would effectively end settlements.
"Why would an employer make any payment if the employee can still publicly talk about it?" Peter Gore, a lobbyist for the chamber, said in his written testimony.
As currently written, the bill would apply to all workplace discrimination cases, of which a portion involve sexual harassment. In fiscal year 2018, people filed about 150 cases of sex discrimination with the Maine Human Rights Commission, of which 54 percent alleged sexual harassment.
[iframe url="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRvMqxEkLZ94zZYyqZ7rhswB7uRpYDurHzWXD5B_QiOKY_N1DOjyAQQ2dUJTxGVsNK6riuwxnSdIevj/pubchart?oid=762870893&format=interactive" width="600" height="400"]
"If we don't shine the light of day on that behavior, we can't be sure it will not happen again," said Rep. Thom Harnett, D-Gardiner, who sponsored the bill.
In addition to preventing mandatory confidentiality agreements as part of settlements, the bill would also stop employers from requiring them as a condition of employment. Pre-employment agreements usually aim to protect proprietary information but can also forbid employees from talking about discrimination that they might experience in the future.
"Our sexual assault support centers have worked with victims of sexual harassment who have been asked to sign nondisclosure agreements as terms of employment," said Elizabeth Ward Saxl, executive director of the Maine Coalition Against Sexual Assault. "That should not be happening in Maine."
But as the early morning minutes ticked by on June 20, the people in the room with the governor -- who have extensive experience with human rights cases -- decided to hold off on the bill. 
The governor supported the substance of the bill, but she had two, largely technical concerns, according to interviews: The language of the legislation was too complex, and the provisions didn't appear to be consistent with federal and state law.
Mills "approaches this issue as someone who has represented employees in human rights cases before," Lindsay Crete, her press secretary, wrote in an email. She said Mills thought the bill "could be improved upon by simplifying the language and by working to ensure that it was consistent with existing state and federal law."
Specifically, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the Maine Human Rights Commission have the authority to investigate workplace discrimination even if victims have promised their employers that they won't participate in proceedings by testifying or providing evidence. By allowing an employee to request confidentiality, the bill could conflict with the agencies' mission and obligations, said Rep. Anne Carney, D-Cape Elizabeth, who has practiced employment and civil rights law for years. As a member of the Legislature's labor committee, she was in the early-morning meeting with the governor.
"I was very comfortable supporting the original bill. At the same time I think that there's an opportunity here to address the governor's concerns and reach common ground," said Sen. Shenna Bellows, D-Manchester, who chairs the labor committee and was also in the room. 
[image id="2896788" size="full" pos="center" /]
Rather than have Mills veto the bill, Harnett -- who previously directed the civil rights education and enforcement unit at the Maine attorney general's office -- sponsored a joint order to recall it from her desk. 
It was one of only five bills that were recalled last session, out of more than 1,000 pieces of legislation. The bill will be amended, and the Legislature will consider it again this coming legislative session, Harnett said.
The others in the room agreed on the need to revise the language. "At 2 o'clock in the morning, when we were all sitting there talking about the bill, I agreed we could work on it and make it better, and I'm glad we had the opportunity to do it," Carney said.
Some on the outside, however, were curious what had happened -- since bills are not often recalled from a governor's desk and given Mills' background. In addition to twice being Maine's attorney general, Mills co-founded the Maine Women's Lobby, which works to prevent discrimination.
"It was surprising to me only in the sense that we hadn't gotten any indication [that the governor had concerns about the bill]," said Jeffrey Young, a partner in the law firm of Johnson, Webbert & Young and an executive board member of the National Employment Lawyers Association. But "in general I think it's clear that the governor supports [the bill] and wants to see harassment end."
The arguments of Young and Gore, with the chamber of commerce, preview those that are likely to continue in the upcoming legislative session, which starts in January. 
[image id="2896789" size="full" pos="center" /]
Ending mandatory confidentiality agreements could prompt employers to more fully examine the systems they have in place to prevent and respond quickly to harassment, to avoid having to deal with potential settlements in the first place, Young said.
"Since most harassers are not one-time offenders, I think it would go a long way toward eliminating the cloak of privacy that allows predators to continue their illicit activity," Young said. 
Gore, however, questioned whether eliminating the guarantee of confidentiality would backfire, dragging out the settlement process, or burdening employees, employers and the court system with expensive cases.
"This person is still free to give evidence and make statements, so there's no protection for us. The end result is settlements will become much more difficult," he said.
With the bill coming up again soon, the governor's statements hint that it's likely to pass, especially given Democratic majorities in the House and Senate. According to Crete, Mills "looks forward to working with the sponsors to refine the bill more during the upcoming legislative session."

Texto completo: There's a cost to caring too much.
Two prominent mental health counselors – a resilience expert at an Ivy League college and a megachurch pastor – died by suicide in September. At the 2017 U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation's Health Means Business summit, Arianna Huffington, sleep evangelist and author of "The Sleep Revolution: Transforming Your Life, One Night at a Time," said people who toil in the charitable space often have the most trouble detaching from work and, well, going to bed.
Meanwhile, Justin Phillips, a mother who lost her son to a drug overdose, is trying to start the #chooseempathy movement. She founded Overdose Lifeline to raise awareness that addiction is not a choice and requires empathetic responses.
Dr. Judith Orloff, a psychiatrist and self-described empath, agrees society needs more empathy given the rising rates of addiction, suicide and mental illness, among other challenges. But she cautions those who choose to be empathic – or find it comes naturally – about the need to care for themselves first.
The New York Times best-selling author's new book, "Thriving as an Empath: 365 Days of Self-Care for Sensitive People" (Sounds True publishing), is now in stores.
Here, she talks with USA TODAY health policy reporter Jayne O'Donnell, who calls herself an "overempathizer."
Question: How do you know if you are an empath? What are the character traits?
Dr. Judith Orloff: Ordinary empathy is the ability to feel someone else's pain as well as their joy, the ability for us to be open-hearted.
It's such a beautiful trait. Being an empath, however, goes further. Empaths have extremely sensitive neurological systems and don't have the usual filters that other people have, so they feel things intensely and often are emotional sponges who take on other people's stress if they don't learn how to set boundaries and practice other self-care techniques ... Most empaths are introverts like myself, but some are extroverts who love socializing but still need to decompress afterwards to take care of themselves.
As part of my research on empaths, I developed a 20-question self-assessment test in my earlier book, "The Empath's Survival Guide," to determine if you are an empath. Some of the questions include: Have I been labeled as overly sensitive? (in a derogatory way). Do crowds drain me, and do I need a lot of alone time to replenish myself? Do I take on other people's stress or emotions? Do I replenish myself in nature? Am I super-sensitive to noise, smells and excessive talking?
Empaths have many special challenges and also many gifts.
Q: There's a clear need for more empathy in our country, isn't there?
Orloff: I believe empathy is the most precious trait in human nature. We need more of it in our country and in the world. Empathy is the ability to put yourself in someone else's shoes so you can see their point of view.
Q: But there are risks in caring too much, aren't there?
Orloff: Yes, I've seen many of my patients, including empaths and all sensitive people, care too much and become burned out by empathy overload – or get involved with addictions, including substances, food and sex to numb themselves out.
Q: What are the most effective ways for empaths to establish boundaries?
Orloff: Taking adequate alone time is essential to decompress. When my empath patients go nonstop in their jobs or as parents – without periodically slowing down – they risk chronic exhaustion, anxiety and overwhelm. Scheduling mini-breaks in your life to take a few deep breaths, spending some quiet time without phone calls, demands or over-stimulation, taking a walk or meditating for even a few minutes will break the momentum of stress and prevent sensory overload.

Epstein Estate Is Weighing a Plan to Pay Accusers

Texto completo: A proposal for a "claims resolution program" was referred to in a court filing by a lawyer for a woman who accused the financier of sexual abuse. Not all the plaintiffs' lawyers are on board.
Lawyers for Jeffrey Epstein's estate are considering setting up a program to resolve claims filed by women who say they were abused by the financier, who killed himself in August while facing federal sex trafficking charges.
The plan was disclosed in a court filing on Tuesday by a lawyer for one of Mr. Epstein's accusers, who is suing the estate in federal court in Manhattan. The filing said lawyers for Mr. Epstein's estate had informed plaintiffs that they were planning to disclose details of a "claims resolution program" to a court in the United States Virgin Islands, where the mysteriously wealthy Mr. Epstein had his will filed shortly before his death.
The estate has retained Kenneth R. Feinberg, the noted lawyer who specializes in compensating victims, to set up the program, his team confirmed late Wednesday. His associates Camille Biros and Jordana Feldman have also been tapped, and Ms. Feldman will carry out the plan once it is set up and if it meets court approval. Ms. Biros has been an architect of programs to provide restitution to victims of the Catholic Church abuse scandal. Ms. Feldman most recently played a critical role in overseeing the administration of the September 11 Victims Compensation Fund.
But the proposal from lawyers for the estate, which is valued at about $ 577 million, was facing resistance earlier in the day.
Bradley Edwards, the lawyer for the accuser, said in the court filing that his client "does not believe that the use of any alternative dispute resolution should stay or modify the course of litigation in this matter."
A lawyer for the estate wrote to one accuser's lawyer and described the proposed program as "voluntary," according to emails reviewed by The New York Times. Even so, the accuser's lawyer, Roberta Kaplan, objected to the plan's being put together without consulting with the accusers and their lawyers.
"Settlement, after all, is a two-way street," Ms. Kaplan said in an emailed response, which was also sent to lawyers for other accusers. She said it was "astonishing" that the lawyers for Mr. Epstein's estate planned to go to court in the Virgin Islands without first discussing the plan.
"In fact, it feels very much like a continuation of his crimes and abuse after his death," she wrote.
The emails were later included in a public court filing on Wednesday afternoon.
David Brodie, another accuser's lawyer, said that he was "cautiously optimistic" about the possible resolution program, but that there were many questions about how claims would be handled.
"These women have already endured horrific abuse at the hands of Jeffrey Epstein and have waited many years for justice," he said. "To turn their personal experiences over to one person selected by Jeffrey Epstein's estate to make a binding decision (which may not be disputed) could be a process that may exacerbate the victimization of these brave women."
Bennet Moskowitz, the lawyer hired by Mr. Epstein's estate to handle lawsuits by the accusers, did not respond to requests for comment on the emails or the proposed resolution program.
The executors of Mr. Epstein's estate, Darren Indyke and Richard Kahn, also did not respond to a request for comment. Mr. Indyke was Mr. Epstein's longtime lawyer in New York, and Mr. Kahn was an accountant for some of his companies.
In the weeks since Mr. Epstein's death, lawsuits against the estate have been piling up.
On Tuesday, three new lawsuits were filed in Manhattan federal court by Mr. Epstein's accusers, including separate lawsuits filed by two sisters -- Annie Farmer and Maria Farmer.
Their lawyer, David Boies, said he anticipated filing lawsuits on behalf of at least one other woman, and called a settlement program "a positive step" toward resolving the claims. "But it is only the first step," he added.
Until last month, Mr. Boies's firm represented one of Mr. Epstein's most outspoken accusers, Virginia Roberts Giuffre, in a defamation lawsuit against the former Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz. A federal judge disqualified the firm, saying its lawyers might have to appear as witnesses in the litigation.
Some accusers are taking advantage of a new law in New York that allows child victims of sexual abuse to file claims for damages many years later. Many of Mr. Epstein's accusers said they were abused more than a decade ago.
New York law also permits crime victims to file lawsuits seeking damages within a year of the termination of a criminal case against the defendant. The clock on such claims started on Aug. 29, when federal prosecutors dismissed a sex-trafficking indictment against Mr. Epstein after his suicide at the Manhattan Correctional Center.
If a claims resolution program is formed, it's possible that dozens of women could seek monetary damages. When Mr. Epstein pleaded guilty in 2008 in Florida state court to a charge of soliciting prostitution from a minor, it was estimated in court filings that he had engaged in sexual activity with at least 30 underage girls.
Last month, representatives from the United States attorney's office in Manhattan met with some of Mr. Epstein's accusers and their lawyers to discuss the status of the investigation since Mr. Epstein's death. Lawyers familiar with the meetings said investigators told the women that they were looking at pursuing charges against people who may have helped Mr. Epstein, and have been lining up potential witnesses.

Texto completo: Swedish teen climate activist Greta Thunberg is heading back across the Atlantic Ocean. She's hitching a ride on a sailboat with Australian YouTubers after nearly three eventful months spreading her climate message across North America.
Among other events, she joined in climate strike rallies and protests from California to Colorado to North Carolina to Montreal.
Thunberg has become a symbol of a growing movement of young climate activists after leading weekly school strikes in Sweden that inspired similar actions in about 100 cities worldwide.
Thunberg is sailing back to Europe aboard La Vagabonde, a 48-foot catamaran operated by Riley Whitelum and Elayna Carausu. The Australian couple are documenting their journey around the world on the YouTube channel “Sailing La Vagabonde” and responded to Thunberg’s tweet for help crossing from the U. S. back to Europe.
In August, the teen activist sailed across the Atlantic Ocean to the United States on a zero emissions sailboat. She has been a vocal critic of flying because it contributes to the greenhouse gas emissions that accelerate global warming.
Here's a look back on her time in North America:
Greta scolds the United Nations: 'I shouldn't be up here'
In September, Greta gave an impassioned speech before the United Nations Climate Action Summit, where she scolded world leaders for not acting quickly and decisively to combat climate change.
"This is all wrong. I shouldn't be up here. I should be back in school on the other side of the ocean," she said.
"People are suffering, people are dying, entire ecosystems are collapsing . . . and all you talk about is money and eternal fairy tales of economic growth. How dare you?" she said.
Greta to US lawmakers: Do something
In the United States, Thunberg participated in climate protests in New York City, Iowa City, Los Angeles, Charlotte and Denver.
She also testified before the U. S. Congress in September before a joint hearing of two House committees on the global climate crisis.
During the hearing, she had a simple message for American lawmakers: Do something.
Instead of planning a lengthy opening statement to start the hearing, Thunberg simply offered a copy of the 2018 global warming report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that emphasizes the dire threat that human-caused global warming poses, along with the climate and economic impacts.
"I am submitting this report as my testimony because I don’t want you to listen to me," Thunberg told lawmakers. "I want you to listen to the scientists. And I want you to unite behind the science. And then I want you to take real action. "
UN report: World's oceans and mountains are in big trouble from climate change
Greta rallies at climate protests
Thunberg had been traveling across the United States and Canada, appearing on “The Daily Show With Trevor Noah” in New York, protesting alongside Sioux leaders in North Dakota, bike riding in Santa Monica, Calif. , with Arnold Schwarzenegger, and joining school strikes every Friday, The New York Times reported.
During a speech in Iowa City, Thunberg hammered the absurdity of it taking teenagers to make public figures take action locally and internationally.
"We teenagers and children shouldn't have to take the responsibility, but right now the world leaders keep acting like children and someone needs to be the adult in the room," Thunberg said. "The world is waking up. We are the change, and change is coming whether they like it or not. "
Climate change: Meet 15 other young climate activists taking on world leaders
While in Canada, Thunberg participated in climate protests in Montreal, Edmonton and Vancouver. The protest in Montreal was one of the largest in the city's history, according to Global News. When she looks back on her time in the U. S. and Canada, Thunberg said, the things that stick out the most include a glacier in Canada’s Jasper National Park that is destined to disappear “no matter what we do. ”
A visit to the Standing Rock Indian Reservation, where there have been protests over a pipeline, also left an impact.
Climate change: Over 11,000 scientists around the world declare a 'climate emergency'
And now, Greta sails back to Europe
Before it was canceled due to mass protests, Thunberg had also planned to attend the COP25 Climate Change Conference in Santiago, Chile, in December, the BBC reported.
"I was on my way to Mexico to continue my overland trip from the Climate Action Summit in New York to Chile. So I reached out on social media to ask if anyone could help me find transport back to Europe," Thunberg said Tuesday.
The trip could take two to four weeks, in conditions that could be challenging. November is considered offseason for sailing across the Atlantic.
"Of course finding a boat ready to sail back across the North Atlantic in late November is not easy," she said. "But it’s amazing to see how many people there are who are willing to help, like Riley, Elayna and Nikki (Henderson). By sailing, I once again want to highlight the fact that it’s basically impossible to live sustainable in today’s societies. "
Though she said she may not make COP25 in time,"it doesn’t really matter if I get there in time or not. There are countless other activists who will speak there and deliver the same message as I would.
"And it’s not like my voice is irreplaceable," Thunberg said. "I’m really looking forward to this sailing trip and getting back on the ocean. This is an amazing opportunity and I am extremely grateful to have the privilege of experiencing these kinds of things. "

Texto completo: Let's be honest, when it comes to religious conviction President Donald Trump makes Vladimir Lenin look more observant than Pope Francis.
So should anyone be all that surprised that in his continuing efforts to woo America's evangelical community he has brought Florida-based television preacher Paula White into his administration to advise his Faith and Opportunity (emphasis on "Opportunity") Initiative.
What would Jesus do? A well-timed forehead slap, perhaps?
Locals hereabout will recall White's time in Tampa where she served as co-pastor, along with her now former husband Randy White, of the Without Walls International Church.
Not only was the church without walls, it was also without much of a bookkeeper, too, since the ministry eventually declared bankruptcy, despite hauling in as much as $150 million between 2004 to 2006. Well, salvation doesn't come cheap.
How do you blow through $150 million in alms? God only knows. And maybe the IRS.
White has since been the senior pastor of City of Destiny near Orlando, which might otherwise be known as the Mission of Moolah, offering the noted theologian an opportunity to sermonize her prosperity gospel to a whole flock of worshippers.
Along with other gospel grifters such as Joel Osteen, Kenneth Copeland and T.D. Jakes, White is a loyal acolyte of prosperity theology, which holds God wants his faithful to achieve wealth and health.
So much for: "Blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven" - just as long as these lazy moochers don't apply for Medicaid assistance.
Little wonder then that the High Priest of Palm Beach tapped White to assist him in convincing his evangelical lambs he really is a very prayerful chap.
Certainly, White will have her work cut out for her establishing Trump's biblical bona fides.
Despite having all the moral comportment of Ernst Stavro Blofeld, Trump was embraced by the evangelical wing of the Republican Party in 2016, largely on the candidate's professed opposition to abortion and a promise to move the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem.
That was very nice, although all these breast-beating evangelicals, who so fervently defend the sanctity of life don't seem to give a sackcloth or an ash about caring for all these children after they are born when it comes to health care, or education, or gun violence. And there was precious little gnashing of teeth over defending family values as immigrant families were torn asunder.
Clearly White has the ideal pastoral pedigree to become Trump's in-house Mother Teresa of tithing.
She retreats to her own mansion for meditation. And best of all, she owns an apartment in one of Trump's pricey New York properties. She not just a White House confidant. She's a customer, too. Perfect.
You're probably thinking: Wait a minute. Across this vast land, filled with countless thoughtful, committed, compassionate men and women of deep, abiding spirituality representing an array of religious convictions, the very best Trump could come up with was someone who regards the Good Book as little more than a stock prospectus?
The New York Times noted White might incur a tax problem if she does not fully divest herself from City of Destiny, since mingling her White House political work while still involved in the Orlando operation could threaten the church's tax-exempt status.
Apparently White will serve Trump as an unpaid advisor, which does seem awfully charitable.
After a stint as Trump's soul whisperer, it is entirely likely White will be able to parlay her White House penance into lucrative book deals and enhanced speaking fees. Maybe Vladimir Putin will call for some spiritual guidance.
For blessed are the opportunists, for theirs is the kingdom of Ka-Ching.

Democratic Socialists of America member announces primary run against Rep. Mike Sturla

Texto completo: A Lancaster city activist and Democratic Socialists of America member is launching a campaign against Rep. Mike Sturla — the first intraparty opposition he’ll face since he first ran in 1990.
Daulton Lease, 26, is a longtime Lancaster County resident and activist. Lease is a leader in local DSA chapter and climate change awareness organization Sunrise Movement Lancaster. His activism has led to his recent arrest for protesting the Mariner East Pipeline.
“The first thing that came to me when I decided to run for this position was I saw someone who hadn’t been challenged in 30 years and that’s not how democracy is supposed to work,” Lease said.
Lease will focus his campaign on advocating for Medicare For All and College for All policies at the state level in an attempt to make health care and education more affordable. He supports the Green New Deal, a “congressional resolution that lays out a grand plan for tackling climate change,” introduced by U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D- New York, the New York Times reported. He also supports legalizing recreational marijuana.
Lease hopes to ride a statewide wave of Democrats — and specifically, democratic socialists — who got elected to the state House in 2018. While the Legislature remains controlled by Republicans, Reps. Elizabeth Fiedler, D-Philadelphia; Sara Innamorato, D-Allegheny and Summer Lee, D-Allegheny, were the first DSA-backed members to join the state General Assembly. These three representatives are a “huge inspiration” to Lease, he said.
Democratic socialism is a political philosophy that supports social ownership of the economy controlled by its workers via a political democracy, a model of government that falls between communism and capitalism, according to the DSA website.
“It’s not a lot [that] you get to see Pennsylvania pushing along progressive policies,” Lease said. “Someone from Lancaster would show that sort of policy applies to the more rural areas, too. They don’t just stick to the big cities.”
Lease claimed Sturla is not involved at a local level, with “basically no involvement” with Lancaster Stands Up, the local progressive advocacy organization. Lease is a member.
“There’s really a desire to have someone who is there to work with the people, standing at the forefront to bring about that change. Not just sitting in the office and legislating,” Lease said.
Sturla has been serving this district for longer than Lease has been alive — a total of 28 years. Sturla ran unopposed in the 2018 election, and overcame his Republican opponent in 2016 with approximately 73% of the vote.
Sturla said he does not know Lease, but will “gladly have that debate.”
On accusations that he’s not spending time within his district, Sturla said he spends a lot of time here and Lease’s activism must not be “a very effective protest” since he has never heard his name before.
“Hey look, it’s what democratic politics is about in the United States of America,” Sturla added. “Everybody gets to say what they want to and we’ll see where policies go.”
JoAnn Hentz, the chair of the Lancaster County Democratic Committee, said Lease did not go through the party before announcing his run.
“Mike (Sturla) has done so much for the people he represents,” Hentz said. “He now has prestige enough to be effective for us since he is the only one of our contingent of representatives who is a Democrat.”
Lancaster County has only one Democrat — Sturla — within the General Assembly. The other 10 representatives and two senators are Republicans.
“I would see no reason for [Sturla] not to continue, but that doesn’t stop anybody from coming forward and running,” Hentz added, noting the party will not select its candidates until its endorsement convention in 2020.
Lease, a warehouse employee, will launch his website this week.

Should you hire a doula?

Texto completo: Numerous studies have shown that women who receive continuous support in labor from a doula have decreased rates of C sections
and give birth
to healthier babies.
When you're pregnant, joy and anxiety often intertwine. l Unfortunately, fears about something going wrong are not entirely unfounded. New Jersey ranks fifth highest in maternal mortality rates, based on data from 46 states analyzed in a USA TODAY investigation in 2018. That means that out of every 100,000 births in New Jersey, 37 moms die. l The United States, which has the highest maternal death rate among developed countries, is one of only three nations – the others are Afghanistan and Sudan – where the maternal mortality rate is rising, according to the Alliance for Innovation on Maternal Health, an organization aimed at reducing harm to women in health care.
To address these problems, First Lady Tammy Murphy has established Nurture NJ, an awareness campaign committed to reducing infant and maternal mortality and morbidity and ensuring equitable maternal and infant care among women and children of all races and ethnicities.
"The color of your skin," Tammy Murphy said in a video on the website of the office of the governor, "should not impact the quality of the care you get or your chances of surviving maternity or surviving your first year of birth."
How do you continue to tamp down all those concerns? With education. With assertiveness. With help from people you trust.
And, perhaps, with help from a doula.
What is a doula? A doula's job is to help pregnant women navigate the nine months that lead to motherhood.
A bill that passed in the New Jersey state Assembly in March aims to improve access to doula services by expanding Medicaid coverage, but federal approval is needed before the bill can have any lasting impact.
Doulas provide non-medical assistance to women during pregnancy, childbirth and the post-partum period. Sometimes known as "birth sisters," doulas serve as coaches and all-around helpers to the pregnant woman and her birth partner.
They can perform acupressure and other comfort measures during labor. They give encouragement to a laboring woman and her partner. They are trained professionals who give continuous physical and emotional support, as well as up-to-date, evidence-based research and information.
"We don't take away anything from the doctor," said Angela Turner, a doula with Community Doulas of South Jersey in Camden. "We work with the mothers, in pre-natal care, asking them, 'What plans do you have? What kind of birth do you want?' with the understanding that birth is unpredictable."
Turner recalled the labor experience of a client whose goal was to have a fully natural childbirth. At 41 weeks of pregnancy, however, she agreed to be induced, but, with the backing of Turner as her doula, she was still able to remain in control of the process.
"She requested female doctors and staff. She wanted lights off," Turner said. "She wanted family members in the room, and she wanted to be able to move around. She wanted time to herself for prayer, with nobody in the room."
"Her doctors were on board with what she wanted," Turner said. "They just waited and watched, as her body did what it was supposed to do. And she had a wonderful childbirth experience."
An ancient practice In some cultures, relatives routinely serve as unofficial doulas, with mothers, grandmothers or aunts helping women as they give birth.
"My family is from the Dominican Republic," said Cristina Ramos, a doula based in the Somerset section of Franklin. "My oldest aunt has been attending family births for 50 years, beginning at age 18. She was a lay doula."
Later, after Ramos became a mother, she, too, took up that role for her extended family.
When Ramos learned that a friend was training to become a professional doula through Doulas Of North America (DONA), she said to herself, "That's pretty much what I do," and switched from a career in sales to one as a doula.
Ronsha Dickerson, director of Community Doulas of South Jersey, says the presence of a doula in a hospital's labor and delivery ward serves to validate and empower pregnant women.
"Our goal is that moms feel they have value in that room," Dickerson said.
Hill knows first hand the difference that extra cheerleader can make. She has four daughters, and each birth was different. Hill's mother accompanied her for the first birth, and she credits her mom's company with helping her make it through labor unmedicated.
"For the second one, my mom got caught in traffic," Hill said. "I noticed a difference right away. It was a horrible experience."
Hilll's third and fourth child were born by C section, so she did not labor.
"Doulas provide continuity of care," Ramos said. "It doesn't matter how long it takes, I will be there for the entire birth."
Meeting moms' needs Most importantly, doulas serve as advocates. They make sure that a pregnant woman's needs are met and her wishes are respected.
Ramos said she asks many questions of prospective clients: "What kind of birth do you want?" "What forms of intervention do you want or not want?" And one that may come as a surprise: "Are you confident that your provider is looking out for your best interests?"
Ramos advises clients to shop around for a doctor or midwife, hospital or birthing center, until they find what feels right.
Advocacy can be especially important for women of color.
As reported in June by the USA TODAY Network, the overwhelming majority of women who die or suffer catastrophic injury in birth or post-delivery are African-American women.
Why does this happen? Doulas say the answer is very simple. "People in the medical field," Ramos said, "they just don't listen."
New Jersey Assemblywoman Shavonda Sumter told a reporter for lohud.com that New Jersey Health Commissioner Shereef Elnahal "hit the nail on the head" when he said, "It's implicit bias."
The phenomenon of "weathering," or the toll that is exacted on African-American women's bodies from the grinding stress of systemic racism, was examined in an influential 2018 article in the New York Times Magazine by Linda Villarosa. "Weathering" cuts across class, education and income levels, and lifestyle factors.
Alynson Sloan-Anderson, a doula with Community Doulas of South Jersey, said the support of a doula can mitigate some of that bone-deep stress that African-American women carry.
"It's important because it empowers black and brown women who have traditionally been underrepresented and overlooked," Sloan-Anderson said. "There's a level of trust that needs to be built up, to where they can say, 'I trust you to come into my home,' and we go in with a non-judgmental attitude, and help them use their voices and advocate for themselves to ensure their health and the health of their babies."
"I have always had women of color in my client base," Ramos said, "but I am hearing from more African-American women professionals who are reaching out in fear. I ask them, 'Why do you want a doula?' and they say, 'I am going to die. My cousin almost died. No one listened to her and she was hemorrhaging.' We have to get them to let go of the fear."
"We need an intervention," Hill said, "because doctors aren't listening, not hearing, they're just going by the book. Not everyone's body is the same."
Expanding access to doulas Under the umbrella of Nurture NJ, the state Department of Health's "Healthy Women, Healthy Families" program has provided funding for partners to hire 77 outreach workers – 40 doulas, 29 community health workers and eight community health worker supervisors – to improve the health of African-American women.

Texto completo: Former Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick is considering a late entry into the Democratic presidential race, according to two people familiar with Patrick's thinking, potentially adding another name to an already unsettled primary field less than three months before the Iowa caucus.
One person familiar with Patrick's thinking said he is “strongly considering" running and may announce his decision this week. This person also said Patrick had reached out to former vice president Joe Biden to let him know he was weighing the move. A second person said an announcement from Patrick could come Thursday.
The New York Times, which first reported Patrick's deliberations, said the former governor has told Democratic officials that none of the current Democrats running for president has sufficient political momentum.
That's a concern echoed among some party elites, who are hand-wringing behind the scenes about the shakiness ofearly frontrunner Biden and worry that his liberal challengers, Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, would run too far to the left to be electable against President Trump. Former New York City mayor and billionaire Michael Bloomberg is also worried about the field and weighing a run, his advisers confirmed late last week.
The window for Patrick's decision is rapidly closing. He has already missed the deadline to be on the ballot in Alabama, a Super Tuesday state; the deadline for Arkansas, another such state, is Tuesday; and the deadline to get on the ballot in New Hampshire is this Friday.
Nearly a year ago, Patrick, 63, announced he would not seek the presidency, citing the “cruelty" of the elections process and acknowledging doubts that he could cut through the noise of a crowded and chaotic primary. “It's hard to see how you even get noticed in such a big, broad field without being shrill, sensational, or a celebrity — and I'm none of those things and I'm never going to be any of those things," he said then.
One obstacle was Patrick's relatively low national profile, though he spent much of 2018 campaigning widely for Democrats in the midterms, granting national media interviews. He was the subject of lengthy profile in the New Yorker.
Patrick, the first black governor of Massachusetts, served from 2007 to 2015 and is a close friend and ally of former president Barack Obama. Like Obama, Patrick has an inspiring life story — rising from the welfare rolls in Chicago to the top levels of government and the inner sanctums of corporate boardrooms — and is seen as a skilled campaigner and powerful public speaker.
“I don't think I've ever met anybody better at campaigning than Deval Patrick," David Axelrod, a former political adviser to Obama who helped Patrick get elected governor in Massachusetts, told the Globe in April 2018. He said at the time that Patrick could articulate a unifying message that would be a good antidote to Trump's divisiveness.
Indeed, Patrick, who once headed the civil rights division of the Justice Department under President Clinton, had been dusting off his soaring, hopeful rhetoric before audiences last year in key primary states such as South Carolina as he stumped for other candidates. If he runs, Patrick will likely attempt to cut into Biden's strong support among that state's black voters, who made up more than 60 percent of South Carolina's Democratic primary electorate in 2016.
“There's lot of buzz about it. He has lots of friends here and I believe could fundamentally reshape the race in South Carolina if he runs," said Tyler Jones, a Democratic strategist in the state who worked on Democrat Joe Cunningham's successful 2018 congressional race.
Patrick's background as a progressive but also pragmatic executive could help him stand out in the current field, argued Joshua Boger, a Democratic donor and founder of Vertex Pharmaceuticals. “I think he's very solidly in the mainstream of the progressive side of the Democratic Party without being on any extreme," Boger said. “But he's actually practical. A governor has to get things done."
But the hurdles Patrick would face should he decide to run are formidable. He is not as well-known nationally as the Democrats running at the front of the pack, or as Bloomberg. Patrick also doesn't have anything approaching the personal resources of Bloomberg, who is worth a reported $53 billion, to help him make up ground in the fund-raising race. A federal political action committee affiliated with Patrick had no cash on hand as of April.
There's also the matter of time. If he gets in the race this week, there will be roughly 80 days until the Iowa caucuses and 90-some days to the New Hampshire primary. Other candidates have been in the race and building organizations for a year or more — and voters in many of these states expect to see candidates multiple times before casting their ballots
Two of his closest former aides are tied up with other candidates. John Walsh, who served as Patrick's 2006 gubernatorialcampaign manager, and is a former head of the Massachusetts Democratic Party, is leading Senator Edward J. Markey's contested reelection campaign. Doug Rubin, another close former aide who also worked on Warren's 2012 Senate campaign, is working for billionaire candidate Tom Steyer.
“If Deval Patrick decides to run for president, I will not be a part of his campaign," Walsh said in a statement.
Mary Anne Marsh, a Boston-based Democratic strategist, said the only way Patrick could pull off a primary victory is if “the Obama operation from top to bottom — all of it — gets behind him." Even then, she added, “it would be the longest of long shots."
Judy Reardon, an environmental activist and longtime Democratic operative in New Hampshire, also raised doubts that Patrick would be able to threaten the race's top contenders entering this late and without money in the bank. “Where does he think he's going to win? If he can't do exceptionally well in one of the four early states, you have to have just a ton of money," she said.
Patrick also could find himself under attack from his more populist rivals over his Wall Street ties. After he left the governor's office, Patrick went to work as a managing director for Bain Capital, an investment firm that drew attacks from Democrats after its founder and Patrick's predecessor as governor, Mitt Romney, ran for president. His former employers include Texaco, Coca-Cola, and other corporate giants.
“The only thing worse for his chances than working at Bain is waiting this late to enter," Brian Fallon, a former top aide to Hillary Clinton, said.
If Patrick does enter the race, he would find himself facing off against fellow Massachusetts politician Warren, who is at the top or near the top of several polls. The two have said they are friends but would operate in very different lanes of the primary, given Warren's populist rhetoric about the excesses of Wall Street and corporate greed.
And although it's true none of the Democratic frontrunners has managed to lock down the race yet, it's still unclear if Democratic voters share the same questions about the field that are driving a wave of late-breaking candidates.
As governor, Patrick was credited with securing reforms in transportation, education, and ethics, and launching initiatives that stimulated the clean energy and biotechnology industries. But he was criticized for severe management failures and the death of children in the state's child welfare system.

A furor over where impeachment hearings will re-air

Texto completo: Prepare for inundation, at least during the daytime. ABC, CBS, NBC, and PBS will be covering the House's first open impeachment hearings live. Likewise many of the cable channels, including CNN, MSNBC, Fox News, and C-SPAN.
The first hearing is expected to begin at 10 a.m. on Wednesday, with diplomat William Taylor and then State Department official George Kent. The second hearing, scheduled for Friday at 11 a.m., is expected to include testimony from former US ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch.
But are televised daytime hearings “open door" enough? Will only working journalists, politicians, and frustrated soap-opera audiences be able to take in the raw testimony itself, before it has been shaped and altered by the analysts?
Last week, Bill Moyers and Michael Winship took out an ad in The New York Times urging PBS to air the Trump impeachment hearings in prime time. During Watergate, the two argued, public broadcasting stood above other networks, which only aired the hearings live, by rebroadcasting them at night — “when people who had spent all day working could come home, watch the drama play out without intrusive commentary, and become a part of the process of judgment." Disrupting regular prime-time programming for a few weeks, they wrote, “is a small price to pay for helping preserve the republic."
When PBS responded to the ad by saying it planned to re-air the hearings in prime time on its digital channel, called World, Moyers was not pleased. In a statement, he called World “a place where important programs are sent to die." “How in the world — no pun intended — does it serve democracy to hide the hearings from people who come home from work to see them but don't have cable, satellite, and internet access? If PBS were truly an alternative to corporate networks, it would repeat the hearings in prime time for the mass audience. Period."

Texto completo: A fellow Vietnam-era veteran, I stand with Carl Gustafson of Gorham, who wrote a letter to the editor published Nov. 5 and headlined "Vet ashamed of country he fought for years ago" (page A6). Like me, he was inspired by President Kennedy's famous call to serve one's country.
But now? Carl wrote: "But now I fret so. ... I am so ashamed of us as a people, a republic, stained by hatred, greed and avarice." I say, throw in "destruction of the planet and the life on which we depend" as well. He continued, "I fear most of all for my grandchildren. God save us."
I agree with Carl. I, too, am ashamed, including for my personal role. Own it.
As suffering Boston Celtics fans sometimes lament, "Larry Bird is not coming through that door." Neither is God. It is up to us. We have to save ourselves.

Vets could teach those who send others to war
Benjamin Franklin is quoted as having said: "Experience keeps a dear school, but fools will learn in no other." It would be wise for all who have power to consider themselves fools.
If justice truly reigned, you would have to be a veteran of a war to be able to declare war. You would have to have learned from experience having to "kill or be killed." You would have to have learned from experience that your perception is yours and not universally shared by the thousands placed in harm's way.
You would have to have met the parents, the wives and the orphans of the fallen - the fallen from both sides of the conflict. Even when you label them "the enemy," they are just as human as you are. Their lives matter just as much as your life. No more, no less, but just as much.

Loud restaurants make for mediocre meals
As a person with hearing loss, I try to choose restaurants that are not too noisy; this usually means no music. These places are hard to find. I have also learned that many people with normal hearing also prefer restaurants where you can have a quiet conversation with family or friends and not be blasted by loud noise. People do not go to restaurants for the music.
A fellow deaf person has written about this subject. Her name is Katherine Bouton, and her book is "Shouting Won't Help: Why I - and 50 Million Other Americans - Can't Hear You." She was once an editor at The New York Times. In her book, she writes about restaurants and their incentive for playing music: It makes people eat faster and drink more liquor - hardly gracious motives. "Noise is the second most common complaint about restaurants, according to Zagat, following poor service," she writes.
What should we do about these problems? Speak up. If you have found it hard to carry on a conversation in a restaurant, ask the waiter or manager to turn down the sound. Or tell them when you leave that you are not coming back because of the noise.
Customers can make a difference.

Mentally ill need options other than incarceration
Maine's legal system puts too many people living with a mental illness in jail for nuisance crimes. The majority of sheriffs in Maine are strong advocates for more mental health services, and do not want individuals living with a mental illness in jail for misdemeanor crimes.
These arrests are often not cases where an officer could just give a summons to a person in an elevated state and leave them. Officers want other options to help; they want to be able to transport a person to support services.
Reforming the bail process could prove helpful, but we must demonstrate our shared belief that treatment changes lives by building a system that supports people with mental illness to have hope. This starts with investing in crisis mental health response services and diversion centers as alternatives to incarceration.

Ties to McConnell deter former Collins backer
Unfortunately, I will not be able to vote for Susan Collins again.
It's not her. It's Mitch McConnell.
A vote for Sen. Collins is a vote for keeping Mitch McConnell in the position of Senate majority leader. He is poisonously patrician and destructive to American governance. He must go. And, in so doing, so must several Republican senators.
I am sorry.

Texto completo: The author of 18 novels and hundreds of short stories, he never found fame or big sales. But his idiosyncratic storytelling drew praise.
Stephen Dixon, whose hyper-realistic novels and short stories reflected his fascination with personal loss, sex, heartbreak, disaster, marriage and old age, died on Wednesday at a hospice in Towson, Md. He was 83.
His daughter Sophia Dixon Frydman said the cause was complications of Parkinson's disease and pneumonia.
Mr. Dixon produced fiction at a daunting clip. Working on a portable typewriter, he published 18 novels and about 600 stories. His final story (about a man who was 80, like him, and who had a cat like his cat) was published in Heavy Feather Review last month, while he was in hospice.
He never found fame or big sales, but his idiosyncratic storytelling drew praise.
"One doesn't exactly read a story by Stephen Dixon, one submits to it," the critic Alan H. Friedman wrote in his review of Mr. Dixon's novel "Frog" in The New York Times in 1991. "An unstoppable prose expands the arteries while an edgy, casual nervousness overpowers the will."
Mr. Dixon tinkered with syntax and diction and used an array of narrative tricks that made his fiction compelling, but sometimes challenging.
His paragraphs could seem to run forever, as if the start of a new one would destroy his momentum. He recounted multiple versions of the same event in the novel "Interstate" (1991), in which a father imagines the shooting of one of his daughters by a driver on the highway, and its aftermath, eight different ways.
And in his very short short story "Wife in Reverse," Mr. Dixon started with a woman's death and ended years earlier, when she meets her husband.
"His wife dies, mouth slightly parted and one eye open," Mr. Dixon wrote. "He knocks on his younger daughter's bedroom door and says 'You better come. Mom seems to be expiring."'
In 1980 Mr. Dixon started teaching at the writing seminars at Johns Hopkins University, where he remained until he retired in 2007. Porochista Khakpour, a novelist and memoirist, said that Mr. Dixon was the reason she studied at Hopkins.
"He permanently alters how you approach storytelling," she told The Hub, the university's news website, after Mr. Dixon's death. She added, "He continues to be the single greatest influence on my work, and I have his voice in my head with everything I write."
Mr. Dixon's honors include several O. Henry Awards and Pushcart Prizes, as well as a Guggenheim Fellowship and two National Endowment of the Arts grants. He was also a finalist for the National Book Award in 1991, for "Frog," and 1995, for "Interstate."
But Mr. Dixon did not become a boldface name in literature. He once said that none of his publishers ever made money on his books.
"He's not better known because, I think, his writing was intimate and personal and cut so deeply," Matthew Petti, an English professor who is writing a biography of Mr. Dixon, said by phone. "He didn't tackle big worldly issues or talk about American culture. His guys were just men living a human life."
Stephen Bruce Ditchik was born on June 6, 1936, in Manhattan, the fifth of seven children. His father, Abraham, was a dentist; his mother, Florence (Leder) Ditchik, was a chorus girl and beauty queen before her marriage and later an interior designer.
Just before Stephen's fourth birthday, his father was convicted of extorting money from doctors to protect them from prosecution for performing abortions. While Dr. Ditchik was imprisoned at Sing Sing, his wife changed the family name to Dixon and explained his father's absence to Stephen by saying he was in the Army dental corps in New Mexico.
When Stephen was about 10, he learned what his father had done when he found court documents and trial transcripts in the basement of his family's brownstone.
Stephen made an attempt to follow his father into dentistry -- he had regained his dentist's license after leaving prison -- by studying in a pre-dental program at the City College of New York. But he did not enjoy science and instead went on to earn a bachelor's degree in international relations.
After graduation he moved to Washington, where he worked for pulp crime magazines and as a radio reporter. Later, back in Manhattan, he was an editor at CBS News.
But after starting to write short stories -- inspired by the example of his brother Jimmy -- he knew he had found his métier. "It was like a cork popping out of my skull," he told Johns Hopkins Magazine in 2007. "I was in ecstasy."
After Jimmy, a magazine writer, died in 1960 when the freighter he was on in the North Atlantic disappeared, Mr. Dixon felt that he was continuing his brother's work. Jimmy Dixon had a short story published after his death.
"There have been times when I've had the feeling he was leaning over my shoulder, giving me approval and directing my prose," he told The Baltimore Sun in 2007.
Mr. Dixon advanced his literary education with a fellowship at Stanford University in 1963 and published his first story that year in The Paris Review. Fiction began to flow from his typewriter; he wrote for major magazines like Esquire and Playboy and for literary reviews and journals, none of them too obscure for him to send pitches to.
In a review of two of Mr. Dixon's books in The Times in 1999, the novelist Vince Passaro recalled working years earlier as a reader at Antaeus magazine, where he would see story submissions from Mr. Dixon arrive regularly "in worn envelopes, hastily addressed," with torn pieces of paper that were signed, "Here's my latest, Stephen."
"If you didn't know who he was," Mr. Passaro wrote, "you would have thought of him as an inmate with typewriter privileges, a desperate voice behind prison or asylum walls, so driven and copious was the prose."
Mr. Dixon drew inspiration for his writing from his marriage to Anne Frydman, a poet, translator and Chekhov scholar who died of complications of multiple sclerosis in 2009, and his brother Don, whose death when a tree fell on him in 2002 is echoed in the freakish death of one of two brothers in "Phone Rings" (2005).
In addition to his daughter Sophia, Mr. Dixon is survived by another daughter, Antonia Dixon Frydman; a grandson; and his sisters, Marguerite Franco and Pat Dixon.
Mr. Dixon continued to write until recently, despite the effects of Parkinson's and arthritis.
In "80," the story published in Heavy Feather Review, he described an old man with wispy white hair, a pot belly and yearnings for a woman, looking at the day ahead at 3 a.m. He will do what he's done for 60 years, as Mr. Dixon had done for about that long: write.
"And that's start a new story, or work on one of the unfinished ones till it's finished, and on and on like that so he always has something to do and go back to every morning."
"If that ever stops," he added, "he doesn't know what he'd do with his time other than go to the Y, shop for food, nap a lot, read, have lunch with a friend about once every six weeks and at night watch a movie his daughter arranged for him to get through her streaming service, if that's what it's called, on his wife's old computer."

Texto completo: She cycled away from her Boston home and into stardom, leaving a husband and three small children for a journey that came to symbolize women's independence.
This article is part of Overlooked, a series of obituaries about remarkable people whose deaths, beginning in 1851, went unreported in The Times.
The decade before the 20th century began saw an explosion in bicycle sales and cycling in general. The so-called "safety bicycle," with wheels of equal size and a chain mechanism that allowed pedaling to drive the back wheel, along with the arrival of the pneumatic tire, had transformed cycling from an acrobatic and somewhat perilous enterprise into a pleasurable, less hazardous and even utilitarian recreation. Bicycles were mass produced as men increasingly used them to commute to work.
Especially significant was that women, for the first time, took to the activity, relishing the freedom it gave them from the restrictions of a homebound existence. Corsets and billowy skirts even gave way to bloomers so that women could ride comfortably. The bicycle was very much a part of the early women's movement.
"Let me tell you what I think of bicycling," the suffragist Susan B. Anthony said in an 1896 interview in The New York World with the pioneering journalist Nellie Bly. "I think it has done more to emancipate women than anything else in the world. I stand and rejoice every time I see a woman ride by on a wheel. It gives woman a feeling of freedom and self-reliance. It makes her feel as if she were independent. The moment she takes her seat she knows she can't get into harm unless she gets off her bicycle, and away she goes, the picture of free, untrammeled womanhood."
If ever there was an avatar of these combined social trends, "of free, untrammeled womanhood," it was Annie Cohen Kopchovsky, a Latvian immigrant who in June 1894, at about age 23, cycled away from her Boston home, leaving a husband and three small children, for a journey around the world. Though Thomas Stevens, an Englishman, had circumnavigated the globe on a high-wheeler several years earlier, no woman had tried such a feat.
Keeping her husband and family a secret for most of her journey, she called herself Annie Londonderry and agreed, in exchange for $ 100, to attach an advertisement to her bicycle for the Londonderry Lithia Spring Water Company of New Hampshire. Her bicycle and her person became a rolling billboard, the first of many moneymaking schemes she would come up with to finance her travels.
Along the way, she signed and sold souvenirs, gave exhibitions of bicycling and delivered lectures to often sizable crowds, whom she had alerted to her presence by sending telegrams to local newspapers in advance of her arrival.
She delighted crowds with tales of her adventures that reporters dutifully reported -- tall tales, many of them. One was that she had been waylaid by bandits in France, another that she had hunted Bengal tigers in India, and still another that she had traveled to the front lines of the Sino-Japanese War, where she was shot in the shoulder. She claimed, at various times, to be a Harvard medical student, a lawyer, an orphan, the founder of a newspaper and an accountant. With her gift for self-invention and self-promotion, there was as much P.T. Barnum in her as there was Susan B. Anthony.
Her audacious trip was completed in September 1895, her return to Boston reported on in The New York Times in straightforward fashion. She arrived with a broken arm, having pedaled for hundreds of miles with the injury, which she said was from a fall.
But the journey was not everything it appeared to be. Details were shrouded in uncertainty, largely owing to Kopchovsky's penchant for hyperbolizing.
Indeed, it's most likely true that she circumnavigated the globe with a bicycle rather than entirely on one; the evidence is strong that from western Europe through the Middle East, the subcontinent and Asia, from Marseilles to Yokohama, she traveled mostly by steamship.
The first leg of her trip took her from Boston to Chicago, and the last, from San Francisco to Chicago, via El Paso, were accomplished -- for the most part, it seems -- on two wheels, and thus it is a reasonable claim that she was the first female cyclist to cross the American continent.
In any case her journey was a pioneering one in the history of women's athletics, in which she cycled thousands of miles.
She was a novice cyclist when she set out, and her first vehicle was a poor one, a clunky tank of a machine weighing 42 pounds. (Most bicycles today weigh 21 to 29 pounds.) She did not discard skirts in favor of bloomers or men's pants for several months. The roads were often unpaved, and it took her three months to make it first to New York and then to Chicago. By then it was late September, too late in the year to begin a ride across the Great Plains.
Kopchovsky considered abandoning her journey, but with a new bicycle weighing less than half the first one, she instead reversed course, returned to New York (whether she cycled the whole way is doubtful) and took a steamship to Europe. There she rode (with an interval of train travel) with great fanfare from Paris to Marseilles. When she departed on shipboard, bound for Alexandria, Egypt, on Jan. 20, 1895, a crowd of thousands -- including a drum and bugle corps and a phalanx of local cyclists -- showed up to see her off.
Kopchovsky's celebrity, though it lingered through the completion of her trip, was short-lived, and her adventure would probably have remained obscure were it not for Peter Zheutlin, a journalist and cycling hobbyist who, decades after her death, became intrigued by what little he knew of Kopchovsky, his great-grandfather's sister. For his book "Around the World on Two Wheels: Annie Londonderry's Extraordinary Ride" (2007), he scoured newspaper archives from around the world, dug up family relics and plumbed the memory of Kopchovsky's only survivor, a granddaughter.
Kopchovsky was born Annie Cohen in Latvia in 1870 or 1871, the daughter of Levi and Beatrice Cohen. The family moved to the United States in 1875, settling in Boston. In 1888 she married Max Kopchovsky, a peddler, and by 1892 they had two daughters and a son.
Among the more remarkable aspects of Kopchovsky's story is that she chose to leave her family to pursue her quixotic quest.
Ostensibly she undertook the trip to settle a bet between Boston businessmen on whether women were as physically capable as men. It was a story she told at every stop, explaining to reporter after reporter that she was to receive $ 10,000 if she finished her journey in 15 months, in addition to the $ 5,000 she earned above her expenses along the way. She claimed in the end to have settled the bet and earned her money. But Zheutlin's reporting cast that story in doubt, and he concluded that there were no such businessmen, nor was there any such wager.
She returned to her family when the trip was complete, and never again, evidently, made bicycling an important part of her life. She wrote a highly suspect account of her journey that appeared in The New York Sunday World in October 1895 under the byline Nellie Bly Jr.
She and her husband had a fourth child in 1897, and Kopchovsky left home again for a time and worked as a saleswoman in Ukiah, Calif., about 115 miles north of San Francisco. When she returned, she and her husband lived in the Bronx and operated a small clothing business, employing 20 people. The business was destroyed by a fire in the 1920s, Zheutlin wrote, and Kopchovsky used the insurance money to start another business in Manhattan, called Grace Strap & Novelty, "with a man named Feldman she met at a Horn & Hardart restaurant."
Kopchovsky died of a stroke on Nov. 11, 1947. Her husband had died the previous year.
In his book, Zheutlin wrote that Kopchovsky had made her journey out of a desire for fame, excitement and the independence that her conventional societal role had denied her. She loved telling stories, she loved having a story to tell, and she loved representing women as being just as entrepreneurial as men.
"Truly there is no way to measure the impact of her adventure on the larger struggle for women's equality -- to know how many women it inspired or empowered," Zheutlin wrote. "But Annie's journey epitomized perfectly the confluence of the women's movement and the bicycle craze and is, therefore, a small but revealing chapter in the story of women at the turn of the century."

Trump didn’t give dog a medal

Resumen: The image, which includes a watermark from news site The Daily Wire, was taken from an Associated Press photo of the president placing a Medal of Honor around the neck of retired Army medic James C. McCloughan, who reportedly saved 10 men during the Vietnam War, The New York Times said. The fake claim, which has been around since 2014, recently resurfaced on Facebook and Twitter and said al-Baghdadi was detained at Guantanamo Bay prison and released during Obama’s presidential term, the AP said. A conspiracy theory circulating on the internet over the past few years claims comedian Bill Cosby was framed with rape allegations by the Illuminati, a secret society of elites, in order to prevent Cosby from buying the TV network NBC, according to PolitiFact.com.

Texto completo: President Donald Trump retweeted a doctored photo last week showing him awarding a medal to Conan, the dog credited with assisting in the Oct. 27 raid in Syria that resulted in the death of terrorist leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, according to The New York Times.
Trump added "AMERICAN HERO!" to the top of the Twitter post.
The image, which includes a watermark from news site The Daily Wire, was taken from an Associated Press photo of the president placing a Medal of Honor around the neck of retired Army medic James C. McCloughan, who reportedly saved 10 men during the Vietnam War, The New York Times said. In the Daily Wire image, McCloughan is replaced by the dog and the Medal of Honor star is replaced with a dog’s paw.
Although Trump shared an edited image, Fox News reported some members of the media were not "in on the joke."
"The mainstream media had a very serious reaction to President Trump’s not-so-serious tweet," Fox News said.
The following day, the president took to Twitter to thank the Daily Wire.
"Very cute recreation," Trump wrote, "but the ‘live’ version of Conan will be leaving the Middle East for the White House sometime next week."
McCloughan told the Times he was not offended by the altered image and thought the Twitter post showed the president "recognizing the dog’s heroism."
Obama didn’t free ISIS leader The death of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi stirred up an old, false rumor that President Barack Obama had once freed the terrorist leader from prison, according to The Associated Press.
The fake claim, which has been around since 2014, recently resurfaced on Facebook and Twitter and said al-Baghdadi was detained at Guantanamo Bay prison and released during Obama’s presidential term, the AP said.
But al-Baghdadi was never imprisoned at Guantanamo Bay, the AP said. He was detained in 2004 at Camp Bucca prison in Iraq for anti-U. S. militant activities, a Pentagon spokesman told the AP. Obama served from 2009-2017. George W. Bush was president when al-Baghdadi was released.
Following a 10-month stint at Camp Buca prison, al-Baghdadi joined the al-Qaida branch in Iraq and rose to the top of the group after senior leaders’ deaths, the AP said.
Illuminati didn’t frame Cosby This one has everything.
A conspiracy theory circulating on the internet over the past few years claims comedian Bill Cosby was framed with rape allegations by the Illuminati, a secret society of elites, in order to prevent Cosby from buying the TV network NBC, according to PolitiFact.com.
A version of this story has been shared on Facebook more than 1,800 times, PolitiFact said.
The article cites a Hollywood insider who said Cosby was such a threat to the "establishment elite" that they had to create accusations against him to destroy his career. The women who accused him were paid to bring false allegations against the former actor, the article said.
Cosby did have a "short-lived" interest in buying NBC in the early 1990s but the deal fell apart in 1993, more than 20 years before he was convicted of rape, according to PolitiFact.
There is no evidence to support the Illuminati story and the writer’s only source is merely described as a Hollywood insider, PolitiFact said. There are no facts to back up the claims.
In April 2018, Cosby was sentenced to three to 10 years in prison after being convicted of drugging and assaulting a women in 2004.
No riches from ‘Island’ reruns Numerous websites over time have published versions of a story claiming actress Dawn Wells, who played Mary Ann Summers in the 1960s sitcom "Gilligan’s Island" was the only cast member to receive residuals from the show, according to Snopes.com.
One article claims Wells’ husband, talent agent Larry Rosen, took issue with the standard clause in her contract that only allowed the actress to receive residuals from the first five times the series was shown in reruns. Wells’ contract was changed and she is the only cast member, along with producer Sherwood Schwartz, who receives payment from the show running in syndication, the article states.
But Wells disputed this myth in recent interviews.
In 2014, she said the cast never received any residuals and she made about $700 a week, Snopes said.
And Snopes reported that in a 2016 interview, Wells said, "A misconception is that we must be wealthy, rolling in the dough, because we got residuals. We didn’t really get a dime."

Should Facebook Allow False Ads?

Texto completo: Readers debate whether it's the responsibility of social media or the reader to sort out the lies.
To the Editor:
Re "An Open Letter to Mark Zuckerberg," by Aaron Sorkin (Op-Ed, Nov. 1):
Why is it the job of a private citizen (Mark Zuckerberg) or even a corporation (Facebook) to enforce false advertising claims? Is The New York Times responsible for checking whether Bounty is in fact the "quicker picker-upper"? Of course not. It is the government's responsibility to create and enforce false advertising claims.
The outrage over Facebook's response to false advertising claims on its platform from legislators is appalling. Why don't they create laws that address this very issue as they have with other false advertising claims? It is in fact the ineptitude of our own government to police political advertising that we should be up in arms about instead of expecting corporations to do what our government is unwilling to.
Jesse Levey
San Francisco
To the Editor:
Neither Aaron Sorkin nor Mark Zuckerberg fully understands the problem with Facebook's policy allowing false political ads. As an educator, I think the real issue is that so many Americans can't read.
The National Center for Education Statistics just released its 2019 results. They're bad. Only about one in three American eighth graders can read at a proficient level or better. Other studies have shown that fewer than 40 percent of 12th graders reach this milestone, and adult reading levels aren't any better.
So even if Facebook users had the time to investigate questionable claims, most wouldn't have the skills to. Reading competency is required to distinguish fact from fiction. Debunking claims that Elizabeth Warren is protecting a climate change hoax requires the ability to understand a scientific study, or at least the analysis of one. But the vast majority of American social media users are galaxies away from comprehending complex texts and multidimensional arguments.
It's time that we acknowledge our country's literacy crisis and its immense power to propel propaganda. Facebook's "free speech" policy may work in a literate society, but it's dangerous in ours.
Colette Coleman
New York
To the Editor:
Despite Aaron Sorkin's obvious familiarity with law and the legal process, as demonstrated by his brilliant screenplays, his open letter to Mark Zuckerberg plainly demonstrates that he does not understand the nuances of the First Amendment. The federal courts have held that information would circulate in a "marketplace of ideas" in which truth would rise to the surface, vetted by an educated public. It is not Facebook's job to separate fact from fiction; it is our job as individual citizens.
It is only through education and careful scrutiny that the public at large will be able to determine what is true and what is not. Policing the purveyors of information, false as it may be, will ultimately do more harm than good.
Roger Slade
Miami
To the Editor:
Kudos to Aaron Sorkin for calling out Mark Zuckerberg. Denying that Facebook has become a media outlet is just laughable, and it is long past requiring regulation. Along with his net worth, Mr. Zuckerberg's ego has grown exponentially and, it appears, distorted his judgment.
Personal Facebook communications are one thing; political ads are quite another. It is well known that even the First Amendment doesn't protect falsely shouting "fire" in a crowded theater. The Facebook content that Mr. Zuckerberg is trying to defend can be just as dangerous.

To the Editor:
Re "Dissent Erupts at Facebook" (Business Day, Oct. 29), about a letter sent by Facebook employees to Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive, objecting to management's decision to allow politicians to post any ads on the site, even false ones:
Here's a suggestion for a possible middle ground:
Publishing a disclaimer with political ads could warn readers that the ad might not be accurate. Political ads would be labeled "paid political advertising" and say, "Facebook does not censor political advertising, so the content might, or might not, be accurate."
Marvin Diamond
Evanston, Ill.
To the Editor:
"Dissent Erupts at Facebook" highlights a dilemma confronting Facebook. There are substantial reasons, including the principle of free speech, to let politicians post any claims they want, even false ones, in ads on the site. On the other hand, dissemination of false information, particularly on a prominent and influential site, can be very harmful.
One possible response to this problem is to let politicians post any claims they want in ads on the site, but to have refutations by Facebook of false or misleading statements displayed prominently with these ads. These refutations should include specific references to relevant sources of information, when appropriate. When this is to be done, the advertiser should be informed. In some such cases, the advertisement may be withdrawn or altered, but Facebook will not be responsible for making this decision.
Peter B. Andrews
Pittsburgh
To the Editor:
An alternative to making Facebook the censor of lies published on its site is to de-anonymize postings everywhere on the web. Let readers see the "who" behind everything and judge truth for themselves. Such identification should be meaningful, including name and geographic location of the poster.
Anonymous lies, spam and malicious phishing are not necessary evils inherent in the internet. Anonymity is not essential to the preservation of speech free from governmental interference. Protecting the identity of sources to prevent governmental retribution is easily distinguishable from a guarantee of anonymity for all speech.
The technology for identifying internet users is available. The World Wide Web Consortium could implement this without any national government's action. Consider fixing the whole system along with Facebook.

To the Editor:
Re "Pushing America to the Breaking Point," by Thomas L. Friedman (column, Oct. 30):
The goal of advertising is not honesty or accuracy. It is to present a product, service or candidate in the best possible light to maximize chances of a sale -- or an election victory. People expect ads to contain lies and hyperbole and usually act accordingly. It's virtually the definition of advertising.
Does The New York Times check every fact or claim in every ad on every page? Does The Washington Post? Does any medium? Why pick on Facebook? Or on Donald Trump for that matter? All politicians lie. All advertisers lie. People accept it. It's the world we live in.
Allen Nacheman
Bangkok
To the Editor:
Re "Facebook Can Help the News Business," by Mark Zuckerberg (Sunday Review, Oct. 27):
Mr. Zuckerberg's initiative of a curated "Facebook News" program seems well meaning. However, it ignores how Facebook's news feed has hobbled the local news industry without a replacement that upholds journalistic integrity.
I'm a filmmaker who studies the effect of social media on local journalism. The affected New Jersey journalists with whom I've talked consistently cite Facebook's news feed as financially and socially damaging. The feed has popularized inflammatory interpretations and inadequately researched writing, rather than the extensively investigated material published by dedicated journalists.
The digitization of media has had substantial social consequences. Online advertisements garner far less money than print ones -- insufficient for a functional news staff. Journalistic quality thus falls. The Facebook news feed's inflammatory articles often source their interpretations from such underfunded local news, leading to a worsening cycle of disinformation.
Beyond Facebook News, Mr. Zuckerberg should amend the news feed to offer socially responsible journalism.

Texto completo: A French photographer said the director hit her and assaulted her when she was 18. She is the sixth woman to publicly accuse him of sexual abuse.
PARIS -- A French photographer has accused the director Roman Polanski of violently raping her in 1975 in his ski chalet in Switzerland when she was 18, the sixth woman to publicly accuse Mr. Polanski of sexually abusing her as a teenager.
The director, who is preparing to release a film on Wednesday dealing with themes of injustice, "firmly denied" the latest accusation, his lawyer said.
In a letter published online Friday by the French newspaper Le Parisien, the photographer, Valentine Monnier, 62, said she was breaking 44 years of silence after a recent interview by Mr. Polanski. In it, the director suggested that he was a victim of persecution, like the main subject of his new film, Alfred Dreyfus, a Jewish military officer wrongly convicted of treason in what remains France's most notorious miscarriage of justice.
"Is it credible to hear somebody say, 'I accuse' when they have branded you and forbidden you, the victim, to accuse him?" Ms. Monnier said in an interview published by the same newspaper.
A lawyer for Mr. Polanski, Hervé Temime, said on Saturday: "For 45 years, these accusations have never been reported to judicial authorities. I strongly deplore their publication a few days before the release of his film."
Ms. Monnier told Le Parisien that she went to Mr. Polanski's chalet in Gstaad, Switzerland, in the winter of 1975 with friends, but had not known him personally. When the group went skiing, she said, he propositioned her in vulgar terms while they were seated together on a ski lift, and she declined.
Later that evening, after returning to the chalet from dinner, Mr. Polanski called her upstairs, she said. "Life had not yet trained me to be suspicious," she told the paper. When Ms. Monnier arrived on the top landing, she continued, Mr. Polanski emerged naked and threw himself on her, striking her, tearing off her clothes and then raping her.
"I was totally shocked," she told the paper. "I weighed 50 kilos. Polanski was small but muscular and at 42 was in the prime of his life. He got the upper hand in two minutes."
She said she remembered fearing she would die. "I said to myself, this is Roman Polanski. He can't take the risk that this would be known, so he will have to kill me."
Mr. Polanski later apologized to her in tears, she said.
Ms. Monnier said she wanted to speak publicly in order to bring an end to "idolizing the guilty ones."
Mr. Polanski has lived in France since 1978, when he fled the United States before sentencing after pleading guilty to having unlawful sex with a 13-year-old girl.
Because the statute of limitations for rape is 20 years in France, her accusation cannot lead to an investigation or prosecution. "I denounce this crime knowing that there can't be any punishment, in an attempt to end exceptions, impunity," she said in Le Parisien.
In an email to The New York Times on Saturday, Ms. Monnier declined to comment further.
Le Parisien reported that it had spoken with members of Ms. Monnier's entourage, including a close friend, family members and her then-boyfriend, who corroborated her story.
Mr. Polanski's new film, known in English as "An Officer and a Spy," is titled "J'Accuse" in French, after the famous open letter in which the writer Émile Zola accused the French establishment of anti-Semitism and deception over the jailing of Dreyfus.
In an interview published in August with a French writer discussing "An Officer and a Spy," which is scheduled to be released in French theaters in the coming week, Mr. Polanski said: "There are moments of this story that I feel I've lived myself.
"Every season there's a new accusation, a new absurd story from a woman I've never seen in my life and who accuses me of things that supposedly happened a half century ago."
In 2017, a German former actress, Renate Langer, accused Mr. Polanski of raping her in 1972, when she was 15, also in his Gstaad chalet. Swiss prosecutors declined to pursue a rape investigation in that case, citing statute of limitations laws.
Mr. Polanski has also been accused of sexual abuse by the British actress Charlotte Lewis, who said in 2010 that the director abused her in 1983, when she was 16; and by a woman publicly identified only as Robin, who in 2017 said that he had "sexually victimized" her in 1973, when she was 16.
Also in 2017, an artist, Marianne Barnard, accused Mr. Polanski of molesting her in 1975, when she was 10. The director said at the time that he rejected the "unfounded allegations."
He remains wanted in the United States over the case involving the 13-year-old, Samantha Geimer, but France does not extradite its citizens. Judges have denied multiple requests from the director to drop the decades-old case.
Feminist groups in France have regularly staged protests against Mr. Polanski, including outside a retrospective of his career at the prestigious Cinémathèque in October 2017.
Although Ms. Monnier first spoke publicly on Friday, she had long made her story known to those close to her, she told Le Parisien. She said she also written about her accusation to France's first lady, Brigitte Macron, to the culture minister and to the junior minister for gender equality, Marlène Schiappa, in 2018.
Ms. Schiappa, in turn, wrote a letter to Ms. Monnier in March of that year, which The New York Times has obtained.
In the letter, she praised Ms. Monnier for "breaking a 42-year-old silence," and said she empathized with her pain, adding, "I understand your indignation."

Texto completo: Just when most of us were hoping not to remember — much less dispute — the White Horse Prophecy, The New York Times pipes up with what sounds like a modernization of Mormon folklore: that one day the Constitution would be saved by Mormons.
Timothy Egan, in an opinion piece written for The New York Times , writes: “Mormons…to the rescue of the Republic? Maybe.”
For those of us who have worked to disremember the details of the Fake News White Horse Prophecy, in about 1900 one Edwin Rushton said he had heard Joseph Smith say that one day the U.S. Constitution would “hang like a thread” but be saved by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
Well, Trump is making every effort to shred the Constitution, so maybe….
When I was growing up in the Garvanza Ward in Southern California, I remember this being quoted in Sacrament Services and Fast and Testimony Meetings. Regularly.
But not so fast!
In 2010 the church officially stated, “the so-called ‘White Horse Prophecy’... is not embraced as Church doctrine.”
Well, that pretty much put the White Horse Prophecy out of circulation. Until The New York Times resurrected it.
Egan goes on to say that whereas the majority of evangelicals appear to have swallowed the Trump bait hook, line, and Donald, Mormons are split down the middle about Trump, and Mitt Romney may be the one to ride in on a white horse and save the Republic.
Although Egan alleges that “most Republicans in Congress know Trump has violated his oath of office … but are also cowards,” and that the same is true of some “Mormon Republicans, such as Sen. Mike Lee of Utah, a former Trump critic, now an enabler,” the hope, he says, is to be found in Sen. Mitt Romney, who “has never caved” since before we elected a guy Romney has called “a fraud” whose promises “are as worthless as a degree from Trump University.”
Needless to say, Trump — who has never heard of the White Horse Prophecy and doesn’t believe in The New York Times — will not go quietly. To shore up his support by conservative evangelicals, Trump recently appointed televangelist Paula White to head up his “Faith and Opportunity Initiative.”
Trump — who has never met a religious value he didn’t dispute — has no idea what faith is, and he defines opportunity the way he defines everything else: what’s good for Donald Trump . Which makes him a match for White, who says the White House now is “holy ground” for no better reason than because “where I stand is holy.” She says that “saying no to President Trump … would be saying no to God.”
I’m not so sure about that, but what do I know? I grew up in California, where, Paula says, “there’s already law that’s passed through the governor that says the Bible is a book of hate speech and to ban the sale of it.”
Which is another reason she may be an even better adviser to Trump than to the television: They both lie. And when Paula speaks in tongues (and she does), she sounds very much like our president speaking in English, which she also speaks, when telling her boob tube congregants that if they do not send her money, “your dream will die.”
Mine certainly will. If she’s right about who God wants in the White House.
But if Egan right, the White Horse Prophecy (no matter that it is not prophecy) is threatening to come true, in the slight hope of the forever-hesitant Mitt Romney.
The White Horse Prophecy and Mitt Romney? Or Paula White and Donald Trump?
Sometimes the choice is between the lesser of two crazies.

Texto completo: Fiona Hill, former National Security Council senior director for Europe and Russia, testified that former National Security Adviser John Bolton was concerned about the push to solicit help from Ukraine, according to a transcript from her impeachment inquiry deposition released Friday.
Hill added to the account emerging from testimony that President Donald Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, was part of a team of nontraditional foreign affairs actors spearheading a back-channel Ukraine policy.
In her testimony, Hill outlined key players in a pressure campaign for Ukraine to open investigations into former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden, who was on the board of a Ukrainian gas company, as well as the 2016 presidential election.

Here are the key takeaways from Hill's testimony:
Bolton was 'furious' about the push for Ukraine investigations
Hill told the House impeachment inquiry committees that Bolton was angry over efforts to arrange a White House meeting between Trump and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky in exchange for political investigations.
Gordon Sondland, the U. S. ambassador to the European Union, was part of a meeting with Ukrainian officials in July. At one point, he leaned across Bolton to speak to the Ukrainians, and said that a White House meeting had already been secured, according to Hill.
“Ambassador Sondland blurted out: ‘Well, we have an agreement with the Chief of Staff (Mick Mulvaney) for a meeting if these investigations in the energy sector start," Hill said.
Bolton then "immediately stiffened" and ended the meeting abruptly, but told Hill to participate in a subsequent meeting to determine plans between the countries for going forward.
“And that’s when Bolton was just, you know, I wouldn’t say apoplectic, but pretty furious,” Hill said.
Hill said she cautioned Sondland in a follow-up conversation against making the commitment for the White House meeting: “It has to go through proper procedures. ”
After the meeting, Bolton told Hill to report the incident to National Security Council lawyer John Eisenberg. "I am not part of whatever drug deal Sondland and Mulvaney are cooking up," Bolton told Hill to relay, according to the transcript.

Giuliani's 'whirlwind' of Ukraine claims
Hill confirmed that key administration officials were so in the dark about Giuliani’s involvement in Ukraine that they learned what he was up to by watching his frequent appearances on television.
“Every single day, it seemed that he was on television, you know, basically spouting off, you know, one thing after another,” Hill told House investigators.
“And it was clearly starting to create this, you know, meta-alternate narrative about Ukraine," Hill said. She called the information Giuliani was pushing through the media a "whirlwind. "
Giuliani's spreading of accusations against former Ukraine Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch is also documented in the testimony of other officials who have been deposed in the impeachment inquiry, including that of State Department official George Kent. Giuliani helped push the claim that Yovanovitch was undermining the president.
Hill described those claims as "a mishmash of conspiracy theories that, again, I've told you, I believe firmly to be baseless. "
The attacks on Yovanovitch led to her removal. Hill said it "had a really devastating effect on the morale of all of the teams that I work with across the interagency because everybody knows Ambassador Yovanovitch to be the best of the best in terms of a nonpartisan career official. "
Hill testified that Bolton was "pained," and called Giuliani a "hand grenade that is going to blow everybody up. "
In fact, Hill said, Bolton was opposed to any officials meeting with Giuliani.
More: Lobbyist says he wasn't lobbying when he tried to oust Ukrainian ambassador. Experts disagree.
Gordon Sondland's activities were 'deeply concerning'
Yovanovitch's ouster was "some kind of tipping point or turning point," Hill said, "because it was after she was removed from her position that you started to see, you know, more of this activity. "
Hill testified that an unusual chain of command opened up in Ukraine policy, with several officials "doing all kinds of things that were not in their portfolio. "
She said that Sondland told her he was taking over the Ukraine portfolio under the orders of the president. She said it was an “unusual development” because other State Department officials had not been given notice of his assignment.
“Ambassador Sondland told me again that he was in charge of Ukraine. And I asked, well, on whose authority? And he said, the president,” Hill said.
She described Sondland’s conduct in this role as “comical” but “deeply concerning,” because, she said, he gave out her personal phone number and told officials to contact her and Bolton with no notice, and Sondland met with officials without any briefings or knowledge about who they were.
“It's like basically driving along with no guardrails and no GPS on an unfamiliar territory,” Hill said. She described him as a counterintelligence risk.
Sondland's conduct in the July meeting and his direction on Ukraine policy was also detailed by Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman's account in his testimony, which was released Friday as well.

"He's not a professional diplomat. And this is not critical of him, but he didn't necessarily act as a diplomat and he wouldn't necessarily, you know — if we had a consistent position and a consistent set of talking points, he would not necessarily be consistent . . . with the rest of the consensus view," Vindman testified.
But, "I think that is very possible that he thought he was doing the right thing," Vindman said of Sondland.
Hill was 'shocked' by Trump's call with Zelensky
Hill left her position days before the now infamous July 25 phone call between Trump and Zelensky. She testified that she was on vacation — snorkeling, to be precise — at the time of the phone call.
But when she read through the rough transcript released publicly by the White House, Hill said she was "very shocked and very saddened," particularly by Trump's disparaging of Yovanovitch. The content of the call was "my worst fears and nightmares," she said.
"The former ambassador from the United States, the woman, was bad news and the people she was dealing with in the Ukraine were bad news so I just want to let you know that," Trump told Zelensky on the call.
Hill said the attempt to get Ukraine to investigate the Bidens and his theory about the 2016 election was "pretty blatant" on the phone call.
"I sat in an awful lot of calls, and I have not seen anything like this. And I was there for two and a half years," Hill said. "So I was just shocked. "
Hill and Republican questioners butt heads
The GOP committee members and their counsel who questioned Hill seemed to frustrate her over questions about whether she had a partisan bias.
Hill was repeatedly asked if she was a critic of the president, to which she had a firm answer: She was a nonpolitical appointee, "agnostic" about supporting Trump.
"I think it's very important to serve your country and to serve the president and the presidency, you know, as being duly elected," Hill said.
When pressed again about partisan leanings, Hill referred to the unidentified senior White House official who penned an explosive anti-Trump op-ed in The New York Times. Hill asserted, "I did not write Anonymous. I am not Anonymous. "
She added that she had been accused "within the White House" of writing that op-ed.
And when Rep. Lee Zeldin, R-N. Y. , pressed Hill on whether she thought it was inappropriate for Biden to threaten aid to a foreign country while his son was involved with an entity of that country being targeted for an investigation, she warned he was entering "dangerous territory" for everyone.
"I think that there is a problem with perceptions of conflicts of interest and ethics for any child of any senior official to be involved in anything that their parents are involved in, period," Hill said, mentioning members of Congress, vice presidents, presidents and cabinet secretaries.

Trump doing better in Wisconsin than national polls show

Texto completo: With a year to go before the 2020 election, some national polls show Donald Trump facing daunting, double-digit deficits in his re-election bid.
But the polling in Wisconsin and other swing states paints a far more competitive picture.
Can both be right?
The gap between Trump's worst national polls and his best battleground polls is so big it simply doesn't add up.
But it also reflects something very real about the political landscape: that nationwide surveys don't always capture what's happening in the handful of states most likely to determine the Electoral College winner.
Wisconsin is a prime example. It is at the top of the list of pivotal battlegrounds in the eyes of most analysts, suggesting that public opinion here shouldn't deviate all that much from what it is nationally. Yet Trump has performed consistently better in Wisconsin than he has in nationwide polls.
The president is averaging in the low 40s in job approval in national surveys.
But in Wisconsin, he is at 46% approval in a Marquette Law School poll released two weeks ago, 47% in a New York Times/Siena poll released Monday, 44% in a Fox News poll released last month, and 42% in a poll just released by the Kaiser Family Foundation and Cook Political Report. Trump's average job approval in those four surveys is 45%, far from stellar but not crippling to his re-election prospects either.
"I think the battleground polls are more meaningful" than the national polls, said Diane Feldman, a longtime Democratic pollster who has conducted many surveys in Wisconsin.
The seeming disconnect between national surveys and battleground surveys was highlighted this week when the New York Times published polls showing Trump either tied, narrowly behind or narrowly ahead of his best-known Democratic rivals in the key states of Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Florida, Arizona and North Carolina.
Takeaway: In the states that matter most, the race is up for grabs.
A day later, a nationwide Washington Post-ABC News poll showed Trump trailing Joe Biden by 17 points, Elizabeth Warren by 15 and Bernie Sanders by 14.
Takeaway: Trump is in dire, dire straits.
"There is a profound disconnect between the state-level polling on the horse race and what we're seeing in the national polling. I don't know whether Joe Biden is up by 17 points nationally or if he's only up a couple of points in Wisconsin, but both can't be true," said political scientist Ken Goldstein, who conducts his own polls in Wisconsin and elsewhere.
Part of the explanation involves different pollsters using different methodologies and capturing different cross-sections of voters with different partisan leanings. Feldman said sometimes national polls oversample the populous coasts, which would skew a survey toward Democrats.
Part of the explanation involves the normal variations in polling that always produce occasional outliers.
But that still leaves the fact that, as the 2016 election showed, the Electoral College picture can deviate from the picture of the nation as a whole. Three years ago, Trump won the decisive battlegrounds of Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania by under 1 point while losing the national vote by 2 points.
If that pattern holds, Democrats might have to win the popular vote by 3 points or more in 2020 to carry the key state battlegrounds they need to win the Electoral College.
Polling since Trump took office reinforces that point.
"In Wisconsin, our (Trump) approval number has been consistently about 3 points higher than his national average," said Charles Franklin, who conducts the Marquette poll. Trump has averaged a little under 46% approval in Wisconsin over the past year in Marquette's polling.
As a result of this gap, anyone focused on the polling in battleground Wisconsin is probably going to get a more competitive picture of the electoral fight than he or she would get from national surveys, where Trump is typically getting approval ratings of 41% to 44% — or, in the case of the Washington-Post-ABC poll, 39%.
"The news this week was unequivocally bad for the White House if you were looking at national polls and unequivocally bad for the Democrats if you were looking at state polls," said Goldstein, a political science professor with the University of San Francisco and before that, the University of Wisconsin-Madison. (The White House also got bad news with the GOP's election setbacks Tuesday, losing legislative control in Virginia and a contest for governor in Kentucky).
There have been variations in both the state and national polls. Nationally, an NBC/Wall Street Journal poll shows Trump trailing Biden by 9 points, while Trump's deficit in the Washington Post survey is almost twice as large.
In Wisconsin, a Fox News poll released in early October had Biden leading Trump in Wisconsin by 9 points. The recent Marquette poll had Biden leading by 6. The New York Times/Siena poll had Biden leading by 3.
While the New York Times poll puts Trump's approval here at 47% and Marquette puts it at 46%, the new Kaiser survey puts it at 42%. One thing that could explain these differences is that in the Marquette poll, the mix of Republican and Democratic voters was close to even; in the Kaiser survey, the sample was more Democratic-leaning in its makeup.
But in the case of the state's most frequent poll (by Marquette), Trump's ratings have been remarkably consistent. The president's approval ratings in the last six Marquette polls dating back to October 2018 are: 46, 47, 44, 46, 45 and 46%. Those numbers have deviated even less than you would expect simply from random statistical variation.
Franklin said his numbers are very consistent with the possibility that Trump's true level of approval among all registered voters in Wisconsin hasn't changed at all over the past year.
What do Trump's job ratings in Wisconsin suggest about his prospects of winning the state again?
If you believe that a president's approval rating is highly predictive of the incumbent's share of the vote, that would suggest Trump is at a significant disadvantage in this state right now.
But some experts believe Trump can and will "overperform" his approval rating, as he over-performed his popularity rating in 2016.
Why? Because so many of his own supporters have such mixed feelings about him personally that it holds down his overall approval rating among people who are happy with key aspects of his performance — such as the economy — and will end up voting for him anyway. Others who dislike Trump may end up disliking the Democratic nominee even more, which happened in 2016.

Texto completo: The interior minister declared that Turkey was "not a hotel" for captured Islamic State fighters as it began to pressure reluctant European states to take back their citizens.
ISTANBUL -- Turkey said Friday that it would begin sending captured Islamic State militants to their home countries in 72 hours, part of an effort aimed at pressuring reluctant European states to take back citizens recruited by the violent extremist group.
"Now we are telling you that we are going to send them back to you," the Turkish interior minister, Suleyman Soylu, said in announcing that the repatriations would start on Monday. Turkey, he said, was "not a hotel" for Islamic State detainees from other countries.
He did not explain precisely how they would be returned or what would happen if their home countries would not accept them. It was also unclear how Turkey would be able to legally repatriate those whose citizenship has been nullified by their home countries.
Turkey has captured several hundred people affiliated with the Islamic State over the last month as its forces seized a pocket of territory in northeastern Syria, forcing Kurdish forces there to abandon several towns and at least one detention camp. Mr. Soylu told reporters that Turkey had captured 287 Islamic State members, including women and children, during the operation.
Many of the detainees come from Western Europe. Mr. Soylu has complained that in some cases European states have revoked the citizenship of suspected Islamic State members, making them stateless.
Most of the detainees were captured after having escaped from a detention camp at Ain Issa in Syria. They have been placed in a facility at Al-Rai, in Turkish-controlled territory in northern Syria, he said.
Turkish-backed Syrian fighters made a swift advance toward Ain Issa at the beginning of Turkey's operation, which began on Oct. 9. The fighters encountered 190 people, mostly women and children, who had escaped from the camp and taken shelter in nearby homes on Oct. 13. At first the fighters were fearful of such a large group but they were unarmed and cooperated peacefully, Mr. Soylu said.
The fighters, members of the Ahrar al-Sharqiya militia, transported the women and children to the border town of Tel Abyad and held them temporarily in houses there, according to one of the militia members, who declined to be identified by name because he was not authorized to speak to the press. Among the detainees were people from Germany, an Irish woman and a British woman with a child, he said. The British woman had flu and the fighters provided her with medicine, he said.
The issue of what to do with captured members of the Islamic State, which once controlled a vast swath of territory straddling Syria and Iraq, has long been one of the festering problems of the Syrian war.
President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey emphasized the importance of dealing with Islamic State prisoners on his return from a visit to Hungary on Friday.
"We are taking back Turkish citizens, their wives and children, who are identified as joining Daesh in Syria," he told reporters, using the Arabic term for the Islamic State. "We impose a legal process against those with evidence of terror links. We prosecute them. As for the children, we involve all our relevant authorities to rehabilitate them to overcome the trauma they have been through."
Turkey was also holding 1,201 Islamic States militants in jails and detention facilities, he said. They include several hundred Europeans, according to officials.
Among them are two Dutch-Moroccan women, who escaped from Al Hol camp in Syria, smuggled themselves with three small children into Turkey and turned up at the Dutch Embassy in Ankara. Dutch officials notified Turkish officials who detained them, according to BBC Turkish, quoting a statement by the Dutch foreign minister, Stefan Blok.
Turkey has complained that the Dutch revoked the citizenship of one woman on the day that she was detained. Mr. Soylu said Britain has also revoked the citizenship of Islamic State members held by Turkey.
"Saying: 'I will revoke their citizenship and you handle the rest,' this is unacceptable for us," he said. "This is irresponsibility. What shall I do with your terrorist?"
Turkish media have listed more than 1,000 Islamic State detainees in Syria, many of them women and children, as coming from France, Germany, Belgium, Holland, Sweden, Finland, Denmark, Britain, Italy and Austria.

Frank DeCaro to talk drag history at the Guthrie: ‘It’s the voice of sanity in high heels and a wig’

Texto completo: Five years ago, an editor from Rizzoli approached author and comedian Frank DeCaro with a proposition: “Someone should write a book on drag and it should be you.”
At first, DeCaro was skeptical.
“I wasn’t convinced,” he said during a recent phone interview. “I had only dabbled in drag in a Halloween kind of sense, looking at best like a Far Side cartoon lady.”
But as he started to think about it, 57-year-old DeCaro realized he’d had a front-row seat to American drag for his entire life, from his earliest days as a child growing up in New Jersey to his adult life that he’s spent covering pop culture for everything from “The Daily Show” to the New York Times Magazine.
“It started watching Flip Wilson or Lily Tomlin playing drag characters on television,” he said. “When I moved to New York, I went to Wigstock every year. I befriended Charles Busch and Lypsinka. I had seen Milton Berle in drag. I’d met Sylvester and Divine. I realized, ‘Oh God, I’m drag hag No. 1.’ ”
DeCaro spent his “own sweet time putting together” what would become “Drag: Combing Through the Big Wigs of Show Business,” a breezy, witty and photo-heavy encyclopedia of the art form that covers everything from vaudeville to “RuPaul’s Drag Race.”
Tuesday night, DeCaro will appear at Minneapolis’ Guthrie Theater for an evening devoted to the history of drag. He’ll be joined onstage by Twin Cities performers Miss Richfield 1981 (who DeCaro covered in “Drag”), Mercedes Iman Diamond and Damien D’Luxe.
RuPaul helped break drag into the mainstream, at first in the ’90s as a singer and, more recently, as the host of the popular competitive reality show “RuPaul’s Drag Race,” the 12th season of which is due to air in 2020.
“I do remember seeing RuPaul for the first time,” DeCaro said. “It was 1988 or ’89. It was kind of amazing. You knew you were in the midst of a star even then. RuPaul became America’s drag queen in the ’90s. My own mother asked to meet him. But RuPaul knows whose shoulders he is standing on. That’s why I did this book.”
DeCaro opens “Drag” by noting men played women on stage during Shakespeare’s time as well as in 17th century Japanese Kabuki theater and a century later in British stage shows. He points to Julian Eltinge — an early 20th century performer who went from vaudeville to Broadway to performing for King Edward VII — as the mother of modern drag.
“Drag has always had some mainstream appeal,” DeCaro said. “Even if you had to go to the wrong side of the tracks to see it, the smart set and the people in the know — gay or straight — sought it out. It’s always been a part of show business and it’s something cool and naughty for smart and open-minded people to do.”
Still, DeCaro is surprised just how popular drag has become over the past decade.
“The mainstreaming of it is shocking to me and I love it,” he said. “The fact you can go to a drag brunch at the Hard Rock Cafe blows my mind. You can’t give RuPaul enough credit. He’s so likable and has shed a light on so many talented people. Really, drag history is not only the history of gay rights, it’s the history of entertainment.”
To that end, DeCaro compares RuPaul to Ed Sullivan or “the ‘Ted Mack Amateur Hour’ with duct tape.” Drag performers, he said, take an old school approach to entertaining an audience.
“It’s not ‘I’m going to do my act and I don’t care if anyone gets it.’ It’s the opposite of that: ‘I’ll give you anything I’ve got so you have a good time. And if you think you’ve seen it already, wait until I get the knives out. Why did I put on all this makeup if I’m not going to give you a good time?’ ”
And DeCaro said he doesn’t think it’s an accident that drag is now bigger than it’s ever been.
“Given the current political environment, drag is the other voice. Honestly, it’s the voice of sanity in high heels and a wig. It’s an interesting thing to have it be Donald Trump’s moment and RuPaul’s moment at the same time. Drag helps to balance things out.”

Texto completo: WEST LAFAYETTE – Days after CVS Pharmacy apologized to a Purdue student who said he was turned away at an off-campus store from buying cold medicine, and then asked for his immigration paperwork, because he showed his Puerto Rican driver's license, students on the West Lafayette campus are asking President Mitch Daniels to speak out about the incident.
On Wednesday, the same day a corporate officer with the national pharmacy chain visited campus to talk to students and apologize again, about 40 students gathered with signs and chants outside Mackey Arena as fans streamed in for the Purdue game against Green Bay. The protest moved across the street to the sidewalk outside the CVS Pharmacy at 720 Northwestern Ave, where Purdue junior Jose Guzman-Payano was turned away Oct. 25 without the Mucinex he came to buy.
Their point: They wanted to know that Daniels and his administration stood with Puerto Rican students and other minorities when incidents like that happened.
As of Thursday, morning Daniels hadn't responded.
And John Gates, university's diversity officer, told students during a forum this week that they weren't going to get what they wanted, because the university likely wasn't going to speak on the issue, according to video provided to the J&C.
Purdue spokesman Tim Doty acknowledged that Gates, John Gates, Purdue's vice provost for diversity and inclusion, had spoken with some Purdue students about the situation and about their demands. Gates did not immediately respond to questions from the J&C. And Doty did not elaborate about how the university planned to follow up Gates' conversation with students or whether the university would eventually address the issue.
The students gathered Wednesday night – several of whom had met with Gates and David Casey, vice president and chief diversity officer for CVS Health – weren't happy.
"As they say, 'Perception is reality,'" Jorge Perez de Jesus, a Ph.D. student in Latin American literature at Purdue said. "By not denouncing discrimination, Purdue is complicit in this case. Students perceive, and rightly so, that university's diversity statements are mere words stated to give the illusion of antidiscriminatory policies."
The situation started the morning of Oct. 25 in a self-checkout lane of the CVS Pharmacy on Northwestern Avenue, right across from Mackey Arena.
Guzman Payano, a junior studying engineering, told the J&C that he'd gone to the store, where he shopped often for personal health care items and incidentals for his dorm room on campus, to buy Mucinex, an over-the-counter medication, for a cold he felt coming on. He said he rang up the items in a self-scan checkout and waited for a store clerk when the machine's screen noted that an ID check was required for the cold medicine. When he showed his ID – one issued in Puerto Rico, a commonwealth of the U.S., that met Real ID criteria on licenses in every other state – a clerk told him it wasn't enough. He said she also rejected his U.S. passport, which he said he had with him. He said the clerk told him she'd need to see some immigration paperwork.
Residents of Puerto Rico art U.S. citizens.
Guzman Payano said he tried to plead his case with a store manager but wound up leaving that day without the cold medicine.
When his mother, Arlene Payano Burgos, wrote an essay from home in Puerto Rico about the incident, it wound up going viral on Facebook.
Accounts of what happened wound up in USA Today, the New York Times and a handful of other national publications.
CVS, through a spokeswoman, apologized Nov. 2, as the story surfaced.
On Wednesday, Kevin Hourican, executive vice president of CVS Health and president of CVS Pharmacy, reiterated that the company was trying to make amends.
"We absolutely recognize Puerto Rican driver's licenses to be a valid form of U.S. identification when purchasing products that require the use of ID," Hourican said. "While we are confident that this was an isolated incident, we are reiterating to all of our stores the correct procedures to follow when requesting identification that is required by law for certain transactions, as well as the forms of identification we accept, including IDs issued by U.S. territories such as Puerto Rico."
Amy Thibault, a CVS spokeswoman, confirmed that Casey was on campus Tuesday and had met with several multicultural student groups at Purdue to discuss the incident. She said the conversation included listening "to students' concerns about the broader issues around Latinx and immigrant treatment," as well as CVS' commitment "to continual employee training."
Casey also reached out earlier in the week to Guzman Payano and Payano Burgos to apologize personally, Payano Burgos told the J&C.
Cesar Guillen, a junior studying mechanical engineering technology at Purdue, was among the protesters outside Mackey Arena and the CVS Pharmacy Wednesday night. He said he was a bit skeptical about what happened to Guzman Payano, who is a friend on campus.
"I didn't want to jump to conclusions that it was prejudice at first, that it was just ignorance," Guillen said. "But after reading more into it, it was a little bit too much to believe that it was just ignorance. It was a bit sketchy."
Guillen said he sat down over coffee with Guzman Payano early this week to hear firsthand about what had happened.
"He just wanted an apology at that point," Guillen said. "He's received that, but there's a bigger movement that's beyond Jose at Purdue. We're just trying to stand up for our community. ... It's been in the news, national coverage, and it's not an isolated incident."
Perez de Jesus said Gates told students that Daniels didn't plan to make a comment, given that the incident happened off campus.
During that forum at Purdue's Latino Cultural Center, Gates told students that he'd "been in deep conversation with CVS," according to video provided by two people who were there and eventually posted on Facebook. Gates told students that he understood that the questions moved from CVS' apology to students' questions about belonging at the university.
"I recognize that people what the university to make a statement of affirmation," Gates told the Purdue students. "And I would tell you, if I could make that statement, or if I could direct the university to make that statement, I would. But I cannot. The university is unlikely to make a statement, in any way. ...
"Know that we are, or certainly want to be, a caring university," Gates said. "But our stance as a university is that we don't speak on every issue and often not on every social issue."
Daniels has been pressed by students and faculty in other incidents, on and off campus. Students held an "Occupy Purdue" sit-in at Hovde Hall, near the president's office, during the spring 2017 semester with a list of demands aimed at improving race relations after a series of white supremacist posters were posted on campus in November 2016.
At the beginning of the 2017-18 school year, Daniels and Provost Jay Akridge wrote a letter condemning white supremacist demonstrations at the University of Virginia: "Racism, anti-Semitism, bigotry and violence like that demonstrated in Charlottesville are the antithesis of those values and have no place on our campus," Daniels and Akridge wrote in a letter to Purdue students, faculty, staff and alumni.
Daniels and Akridge sent a similar letter again at the start of the fall 2019 semester.
In November 2018, West Lafayette City Council members approved a resolution welcoming Puerto Rican residents looking to escape from the devastation of Hurricane Maria. It opened with a reminder that Puerto Rican residents are U.S. citizens. According to Purdue data, 71 students on campus are from Puerto Rico.
"What we're asking is simple," Perez de Jesus said. "A public statement about what happened to Jose at CVS and letting campus know that Purdue won't stand for that – that Purdue stands with its students and its diversity policies – is all students are asking for now."

Juul, Anticipating a Ban, Pulls Mint-Flavored Pods From E-Cigarette Lineup

Texto completo: The troubled e-cigarette company moved in advance of an expected federal ban on most flavored e-cigarettes that have become popular with teenage vapers.
Juul Labs, the nation's largest seller of e-cigarettes, said on Thursday that it would stop selling mint-flavored pods, which have become especially popular among teenagers.
The move precedes an anticipated federal flavor ban that is to be announced soon, one that the Food and Drug Administration initially had said would include mint as well as menthol. In recent weeks, intense lobbying by the vaping and tobacco industries against a menthol ban has heightened speculation that menthol would be exempt from any prohibitions against flavors.
Juul said on Thursday that it would continue to sell menthol pods and its two tobacco products.
The company's decision also followed the release earlier this week of two major surveys showing another year-over-year spike in teenage vaping of e-cigarettes, and the rising popularity of mint-flavored nicotine pods as other youth-friendly flavors like unicorn milk were pulled from retail shelves. Public health experts have urged the federal government and lawmakers to impose strict limits on the variety of e-cigarettes, which remain on the market despite little evidence that they are safe.
Besides the surveys showing about 27 percent of high school students reporting that they had vaped e-cigarettes recently, hospitals and doctors have been startled in recent months by an alarming outbreak of lung injuries largely related to vaping products containing THC, the high-inducing ingredient in marijuana. Some patients, however, have reported vaping both THC and nicotine products, leaving researchers to suggest there may be more than one culprit behind the respiratory illnesses.
Juul, which is the target of several investigations, including a criminal inquiry in Northern California and two into its marketing practices by the Federal Trade Commission and the F.D.A., has been blamed for much of the increase in teenage vaping and the risk its products carry for nicotine addiction.
In response to the backlash from parents, schools and lawmakers, the troubled company had already stopped selling an array of fruit- and dessert-flavored pods, like mango and crème brûlée, to retailers, and just recently stopped selling them online as well. The company said recently that mint-flavored pods made up about 70 percent of its latest sales.
A study released on Tuesday by the National Institute on Drug Abuse found that teenagers surveyed in 2019 preferred mint and mango Juul flavors. One-third of the roughly 43,000 students in eighth, 10th and 12th grade who took the survey were selected at random and asked about their preferences. Of those students, 18 percent reported recent e-cigarette use, with nearly 13 percent using Juul. Eighth graders were most likely to use mango, mint and fruit. Tenth and 12th graders preferred mint, followed by mango.
Menthol was the least popular flavor, the study showed, although several public health advocates warned that with other options gone, teenagers would most likely move to menthol.
The final results of the National Youth Tobacco Survey, conducted by the Food and Drug Administration with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, were also published this week and documented a continued rise in the number of teenagers vaping nicotine.
"These results are unacceptable and that is why we must reset the vapor category in the U.S. and earn the trust of society by working cooperatively with regulators, attorneys general, public health officials and other stakeholders to combat underage use," said K.C. Crosthwaite, who became chief executive of Juul in September, after leaving Altria. The tobacco giant now owns a 35 percent stake in Juul.
The survey showed that more than five million minors reported recent use of e-cigarettes this year, compared with 3.6 million in 2018. About one-quarter of high school students reported vaping within 30 days of the survey, up from 20 percent last year.
The study was published on Tuesday in JAMA, The Journal of the American Medical Association. It noted that nicotine exposure during adolescence can harm the developing brain, which continues to form until about age 25. The study found that more than 10 percent of middle school students reported current use of e-cigarettes.
For the first time, at the insistence of the F.D.A., the survey asked students what brand of e-cigarettes they generally used. Juul was the overwhelming favorite. Fifty-nine percent of high school e-cigarette users said they usually used Juul, as did 54 percent of middle school users. The majority of e-cigarette users reported using flavored varieties, with fruit flavors being the most popular, followed by mint or menthol.
The timing of the F.D.A.'s announcement on a proposed flavor ban remained unclear. Intensive lobbying by the tobacco and vaping industries, as well as retailers, may have influenced the Trump administration to exempt menthol from any flavor ban, especially since traditional menthol cigarettes are still available for sale.
On Wednesday, Kellyanne Conway, a senior administration aide, indicated that an announcement would be made soon but also said the White House was concerned about the effect such a ban would have on businesses like vape shops.
She also noted the latest survey data and the vaping trends among teenagers.
The study in JAMA, she said, made clear that "kids report they use mint and other flavors like mango, bubble gum, tutti frutti, unicorn milk, pretty remarkable, and that they don't care for menthol, which of course many smokers -- I'm not one -- say tastes like tobacco."

Texto completo: The 2016 Democratic nominee said she viewed two central policies embraced by the left in the 2020 primary -- single-payer health care and a wealth tax -- as unworkable or politically impractical.
Hillary Clinton said Wednesday she hoped for a return to "boring, normal times" after the 2020 election, voicing skepticism of her party's populist wing and predicting that Senator Elizabeth Warren's proposal for single-payer health care would never get enacted.
At The New York Times DealBook conference in New York, Mrs. Clinton said she saw two of the biggest policies embraced by the left in the 2020 Democratic primary -- "Medicare for all"-style health care and a tax on the assets of the very wealthy -- as unworkable or politically impractical. She said Democrats should pursue the goal of universal health coverage, but through other means.
A longtime leader of her party's moderate wing, Mrs. Clinton was most blunt about Ms. Warren's proposal to replace private health insurance with a single-payer system funded largely by taxes on the wealthy and corporations. Asked if she thought that proposal could get passed into law, Mrs. Clinton answered in the negative.
"No, I don't -- I don't," she said. "But the goal is the right goal."
Mrs. Clinton did not criticize either Ms. Warren or Senator Bernie Sanders, the liberal populist who challenged Mrs. Clinton in the 2016 primary and who also supports Medicare for all, in harsh or personal terms. But she suggested that the approach to health care favored by both was misguided, saying that "the smarter approach is to build on what we have" by adding the option of a public health care plan to the offerings of the Affordable Care Act.
It is not a surprising preference for Mrs. Clinton: In the 2016 campaign, she supported introducing a public health insurance option but consistently rejected Mr. Sanders's calls for single-payer health care.
Speaking on Thursday at North Carolina A&T State University in Greensboro, N.C., Ms. Warren was asked about Mrs. Clinton's remarks.
"I'm saying, you don't get what you don't fight for," she said in response. "You know, you got to be willing to get out there and fight."
Mrs. Clinton's comments suggest she remains skeptical of the populist forces on the rise in Democratic politics. While she did not endorse a candidate, she indicated a clear preference in one of the largest debates raging in the Democratic Party: whether to nominate a candidate who would make sweeping changes to the country's government and economy, or someone who would restore something like normalcy in Washington.
"I would like us to return to a presidency where we don't have to wake up every day worried," Mrs. Clinton said, adding, "I'd like us to get back to sort of boring, normal times."
She also said she believed she knew who the Democratic nominee was "likely to be," but declined to name that person.
Mrs. Clinton, who has not entirely ruled out another run for the presidency but has taken no apparent steps toward a campaign, also sounded a note of skepticism about the detail-rich policy debates that have helped shape the Democratic primary so far. Those disputes during primary season, she said, do not always translate into actual governance after the election.
Her 2008 primary battle with Barack Obama furnished an instructive case study, Mrs. Clinton said: During that campaign, Mr. Obama fiercely opposed her proposal for a government mandate that all individuals purchase health insurance, but he went on to include that very rule as president.
The clash over health care unfolding in the primary now, she said, represented "a very healthy debate."
Of a tax on wealth, which is favored by both Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders, Mrs. Clinton questioned whether it could really function as its proponents intend. She said she would support other methods of taxing the rich, like raising income-tax rates, imposing stiffer estate taxes and eliminating certain provisions of the tax code that favor the financial sector.
"I think there are other ways to raise the revenues, and ways that do get those who are well-off to pay more, because I do think we've got to have that as part of our effort to combat inequality," Mrs. Clinton said.
In theory, Mrs. Clinton herself could be subject to the wealth taxes proposed by Ms. Warren, who has called for a levy on fortunes over $ 50 million, and Mr. Sanders, who would impose a similar tax on fortunes greater than $ 32 million. Mrs. Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, have earned well over $ 100 million through paid speaking and book deals since the turn of the century.

'AKHNATEN' at the Metropolitan Opera (Nov. 8, 8 p.m.; Nov. 12, 7:30 p.m.; through Dec. 7). Phelim McDermott's take on Philip Glass's opera, originally produced by the English National Opera and the L.A. Opera, arrives in New York, with the superlative countertenor Anthony Roth Costanzo in the title role. He is joined by J'Nai Bridges as Nefertiti, Disella Larusdottir as Queen Tye, Aaron Blake as the High Priest of Amon, Will Liverman as Horemhab, Richard Bernstein as Aye, Zachary James as Amenhotep III, and a troupe of acrobats and jugglers.

ATTACCA QUARTET AND CAROLINE SHAW at the David Rubenstein Atrium (Nov. 14, 7:30 p.m.). In a free concert that echoes the popular Nonesuch and New Amsterdam recording they released in April, the Attacca Quartet plays Shaw's "Entr'acte," "Valencia," "Plan and Elevation," and supplies backing for Shaw, singing some of her own compositions for strings and voice. This weekend, another string quartet joins a vocalist: The soprano Tony Arnold performs Berg's "Lyric Suite" with the Schumann Quartet at Alice Tully Hall (Friday, 7:30 p.m.).
212-721-6500, lincolncenter.org
BAVARIAN RADIO SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA at Carnegie Hall (Nov. 8-9, 8 p.m.). Munich plays host not only to one of the best opera houses in the world, but also to one of the best orchestras: the Bavarian Radio Symphony. Of the two programs led by the conductor Mariss Jansons, the first, on Friday, is the more interesting, with Brahms's Symphony No. 4, "Four Last Songs," sung by the outstanding soprano Diana Damrau, and the interludes from his "Intermezzo." On Saturday, there is the overture to Weber's "Euryanthe," Shostakovich's Symphony No. 10 and Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 23; Rudolf Buchbinder is the soloist.

Texto completo: If Michael Bloomberg actually decides to launch a late bid for the 2020 Democratic nomination, the FEC may want to launch an investigation, because it would be a massive gift to Sen. Elizabeth Warren's campaign.
Bloomberg has been flirting with the idea of running for president as a Democrat for months, but now the New York Times is reporting he's actually having staffers move to get him on the ballot for the Alabama primary, which has one of the early filing deadlines for candidates. Ostensibly, he's been watching the nomination battle play out, sees an elderly and bumbling Joe Biden on one hand and a bunch of leftists proposing insane things that could make them unelectable on the other hand, and is getting tempted.
If Bloomberg does run, especially this late, he'd have no path to the nomination. He's actually nine months older than Biden. The lifelong Democrat who turned Republican because it was a clearer path to becoming mayor in 2001, then became an independent, and then a Democrat again, would have great difficulty making his case to the modern Democratic electorate. His chances of gaining support were always remote, but they would be even more so were he to start to campaign this late, given that rivals have spent months working voters and building infrastructure in the key states. Despite media stories of panic, 85% of Democratic voters say they are satisfied with the current field.
Though Bloomberg wouldn't have a chance of winning, he could significantly boost Warren (and likely also Bernie Sanders), in two main ways.
The most direct way is that to the extent Bloomberg can attract any support, it's likely to be from the more moderate wing of the Democratic Party, which is a key part of Biden's base. Even if he doesn't draw big numbers, if one of the early states comes down to a few points, Bloomberg could siphon off enough votes to put Warren over the top. He is not likely to attract any of Warren's or Sanders' voters.
The more indirect way is that if Bloomberg enters the race, he'll inevitably run against the radical turn in the Democratic Party. He'll rail against the wealth tax, kicking 180 million people off private insurance, spending $34 trillion to socialize health insurance, and so on. And because he's a big name with lots of media connections, his attacks will get a lot of attention.
And who could Warren choose as a better poster child for those opposed to her plans than a multibillionaire who decided to come out of political retirement and spend oodles of cash trying to take her down?
If Bloomberg does jump in, Warren can celebrate Christmas a bit early this year.

Democrats are in denial over Pete Buttigieg and black homophobia

Texto completo: It’s an intersectionality paradox: What do you do when a supposedly oppressed class such as African Americans is also an oppressor to another group, such as gay people? Apparently, for Democrats, the answer is to bury your head in the sand.
New York Times columnist Charles Blow, not exactly known for his tempered reason and nuance, blasted the idea that homophobia has anything to do with Pete Buttigieg’s poor polling among black voters, calling it a “disgusting, racist trope, secretly nursed and insidiously whispered by white liberals with contempt for the very black people they court and need.” His sentiments are shared by Boston Globe columnist Renée Graham, who called concerns over black homophobia a “rancid narrative.” Similarly, Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris dismissed this all as a racist trope.
Yet polls show black people hold less accepting views toward homosexuality. To suggest that this magically goes away when it comes to their voting patterns is absurd.
According to 2017 data from the non-partisan Pew Research Center, black people are substantially less likely to say "homosexuality should be accepted by society" than whites or Hispanics. About 73% of Hispanics say gay people deserve acceptance in society, and 70% of whites, but just 63% of black respondents agreed.
That's a significant gulf.
Meanwhile, according to 2019 Pew data, 62% of white people favor same-sex marriage, compared to 58 % of Hispanics and just 51% of black people. According to a 2014 Pew survey, 70% of black respondents said homosexual behavior is a sin, compared to just 47% of whites.
Consider that Buttigieg polls terribly with black primary voters, despite being somewhat moderate like Joe Biden, their most favored candidate. It’s clear that black people are generally less comfortable with gay people and less likely to support electing one president.
Evidence of black voters’ homophobia is clearly supported by survey data, undercutting Blow's argument that it's a “racist trope” or whatever wokescolds with their heads in the sand want to call it.
Of course, this does not mean that all black people are homophobic — it’s always wrong to apply broad generalizations to any individual. But we can’t ignore data just because it makes the politically correct elite uncomfortable.
Of course, Blow and others suggest different factors are at play, such as Buttigieg’s mishandling of race-relations as South Bend, Indiana, mayor. They are not wrong. Where they err is to suggest that black homophobia does not play a major part in his struggles with black voters as well, when all facts suggest otherwise.
An internal Buttigieg campaign memo, for instance, exposed focus group findings that being gay was a “barrier” for many black voters. Democratic Rep. Jim Clyburn, African American himself, has acknowledged publicly the role homophobia has played with Buttigieg’s struggle among black voters in South Carolina. Even Al Sharpton recently said, “We've got to openly deal with the homophobia that still lingers in parts of the black community.”
Are these prominent black liberals guilty of racist tropes?
Denial is not a strategy. If liberals want the underlying attitudes of the black community toward homosexuality to change, they must at least acknowledge the problem’s existence. Yes, even if it makes them uncomfortable.

Texto completo: If there’s one thing that elite opinion tends to agree about on the left and the right, it’s that nationalism is a very bad thing. If anything, this view has become even more entrenched as nationalism has demonstrated its potency in recent years, from the election of Donald Trump to Britain’s vote to leave the European Union.
When President Trump first openly embraced the term "nationalist" at a 2018 campaign rally, commentators reacted in horror. Patriotism is about love, nationalism about hate, New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof opined. Trump, insisted Jennifer Rubin of The Washington Post, is "normalizing a hateful political philosophy that is contrary to our deepest-held beliefs."
As I write in my new book, "The Case for Nationalism," this reflexive hostility to the concept is ill-informed and an attempt to deem nationalism a swearword and end all discussion on that basis.
At its most basic, the scholar Azar Gat writes, nationalism is "the doctrine and ideology that a people is bound together in solidarity, fate, and common political aspirations." Historian Anthony Smith described the national ideal as "a belief that all those who shared a common history and culture should be autonomous, united and distinct in their recognized homelands."
A key contention of nationalism is that a nation has its rights and claims. This is a thread that runs through the Declaration of Independence, the Gettysburg Address and the Atlantic Charter. A nation has the right to break off from larger sovereignties in the cause of self-determination (see, for instance, 1776), and to remake its regime or foundational governing rules (see, for instance, 1789).
So if a nation's rights and interests are being trampled, loyalty to the nation, i.e., nationalism, may require treason against the government, the object of patriotic loyalty. As Michael Lind explains, "Governments should serve nations, not nations governments."
When Europe went off the rails in the early 20th century, nationalism as such didn't cause its crash so much as social Darwinism, militarism and the cult of charismatic leadership. The aftermath of World War I added its own poison.
Regardless, American nationalism — which encompasses such diverse, rightly beloved figures as Alexander Hamilton, Abraham Lincoln and Teddy Roosevelt — is not to be feared. As with so many other things about this country, it is more benign than the versions to be found in Europe and other places around the world.
This is true for a number of reasons. First, we are the inheritors of an Anglo-American tradition that has profound respect for the individual and the rule of law and is a fundamental part of our national identity.
The sheet anchor of American sovereignty, the U.S. Constitution, makes it clear that authority ultimately resides with "we the people of the United States." The Constitution also happens to be a durable mechanism of self-government and itself an object of patriotic loyalty and national pride.
Finally, the United States was never infected with the dream of universal empire that Europe inherited from Rome and that has lingered on in differing forms from Charlemagne to the European Union.
The rise of Donald Trump has pushed the left further away from respect for nationalistic attitudes and even patriotic symbols. Democrats — and the country — would be much better served if they countered Trump's nationalism with a version of their own.
On his own side of the aisle, Trump has made Republicans more nationalistic. Still, much of the party is quietly uncomfortable with this. If Trump loses in 2020, the party's establishment may try to snap back to its pre-Trump disposition of relative indifference to nationalism.
Yet, if there's one clear political lesson from the long history of nationalism in this country and elsewhere, it is that a party interested in moving people and selling a program should make some sort of an appeal to it — even if conventional wisdom insists it is foolish and wrong.

Texto completo: Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren offered to meet with Microsoft founder Bill Gates after he joked that her proposed wealth tax might cost him $100 billion.
Speaking at The New York Times DealBook Conference on Wednesday, Gates said that he's open to higher wealth taxes: "I've paid over $10 billion in taxes. I've paid more than anyone in taxes. I'm glad to have paid—if I'd had to pay $20 billion, that's fine. "
"But when you say I should pay $100 billion, OK, then I'm starting to do a little math about what I have left over," Gates said. "Sorry, I'm just kidding. "
Gates also said he wasn't sure Warren would be open to "sit down with somebody who has large amounts of money" to discuss policy ideas.
Warren responded in a tweet Thursday, saying, "I'm always happy to meet with people, even if we have different views. @BillGates, if we get the chance, I'd love to explain exactly how much you'd pay under my wealth tax. (I promise it's not $100 billion. )"
In the plan Warren released last week to pay for her proposed Medicare for All plan, she outlines a tax on billionaires of 6% net worth above $1 billion.
More: Elizabeth Warren says 'Medicare for All' plan increases taxes on billionaires, avoids hike on middle class
Gates' net worth is estimated by Forbes to be nearly $107 billion. The Times' Andrew Ross Sorkin asked Gates how he felt about that plan, and estimated it would add $6 billion to what Gates already pays in taxes.
"I'm all for super progressive tax systems," Gates said, but he added later that, "I'd love somebody to find a middle ground approach," and said that taxing too much could harm the idea that the United States is a good place to "do innovative companies. "
Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, another candidate running for president with a Medicare for All plan, also weighed in.
"Say Bill Gates was actually taxed $100 billion," Sanders tweeted on Thursday. "We could end homelessness and provide safe drinking water to everyone in this country. "
"Bill would still be a multibillionaire," Sanders continued.
Sanders has come under scrutiny for saying he believes billionaires should not exist in America.
2020 candidate Tom Steyer, a billionaire himself, also sent a message to Gates on Twitter: "a wealth tax is the right thing to do. Don’t panic - you’ll be alright. "
Asked if he would vote for Warren if she were the Democratic nominee facing off against President Donald Trump, Gates declined to answer.
"I'm not going to make political declarations, but I do think no matter what policy somebody has in mind, a professional approach. . . I would weight the most," Gates said.
Warren currently stands behind only former Vice President Joe Biden in a recent national poll by USA TODAY and Suffolk University.

How will Buttigieg pay for trillions in spending?

Texto completo: Presidential hopeful Pete Buttigieg has some explaining to do, and likely soon.
The South Bend mayor surged in the polls after attacking front-runner Elizabeth Warren for not revealing how she would pay for her massive Medicare expansion, a move that positioned him as a moderate in a field led by liberals.
But here's what's escaped notice so far. Buttigieg himself wants to increase spending in everything from health care and climate change to rural infrastructure and national service. And he hasn't said how he'll pay for it all.
An IndyStar review of 10 major policy proposals released by Buttigieg, in fact, reveals that he plans to spend more than $4 trillion over time. While the race has been defined by massive spending plans by Bernie Sanders and Warren — her Medicare expansion alone would cost $20.5 trillion — that's still a big chunk of change.
And Buttigieg, too, left out many details as his campaign rolled out a host of new initiatives.
When asked by IndyStar, his campaign declined to say, at this time, how he would pay for the majority of his plans. A spokeswoman, though, said details would be coming soon.
With the federal budget deficit ballooning to $1.1 trillion in 2020 under President Trump, political scientists interviewed by IndyStar say Buttigieg needs to explain how he'll find the cash.
"Just about anybody would be more conservative than Warren and Sanders," said Larry Sabato, a political science professor at the University of Virginia. "I suppose they make all of the other Democrats look more moderate. But Buttigieg has some big numbers in there too."
Buttigieg's biggest expenditures are on climate and Medicare The largest chunk of Buttigieg's spending is dedicated to two plans, according to the IndyStar analysis. He proposes to pay for his $2 trillion or so climate plan with carbon fees and his $1.5 trillion "Medicare for all who want it" expansion by rolling back the Trump tax cuts and negotiating drug prices.
But he hasn't released details yet of exactly how that would work.
Many of his other proposals require policy changes from the federal to local levels of government and it's unclear how those would affect budgets. But he proposed hard spending numbers in these eight initiatives:
$250 billion annually for disaster preparedness.
$135.7 billion within 10 years and $6.6 billion annuallyfor rural infrastructure and initiatives.
$100 billion over 10 years for addiction and mental health.
$100 million annually for youth programs as an alternative to prison.
$60 billion annually for gender equality.
$60 billion annually for African American equality.
$20 billion over 10 years for a national service plan.
$1 billion annually to fight white supremacy terrorism.
Political watchers say it's a surprise no other candidates have asked him how he's going to pay for it all. Some pundits think Buttigieg, who has been campaigning in Iowa and New Hampshire this week, will beat his opponents to the punch by releasing the details first.
"I'm waiting for Warren or someone to hit back and ask, 'OK Pete, where are you getting the money from?'" said Andy Downs, director of the Mike Downs Center for Indiana Politics. "Given the strategic planning he has done so far, I wonder if his campaign is timing this to a talk he will be giving someplace soon."
Several pundits wondered whether he'd propose a wealth tax, like Warren, who released her Medicare spending plan after attacks from Buttigieg and others. Other pundits think Buttigieg will simply say he's going to move money around from existing programs.
"He's trying to prepare himself to take over for Joe Biden," Sabato said. "But is a wealth tax something that Joe Biden would propose? I don't know."
Sabato said Buttigieg's overall spending appears to be more in line with what Biden has proposed than with the plans of the more progressive candidates.
"Buttigieg is preparing to be the nominee," Sabato said, "positioned perfectly between the left and the middle, but without releasing the kind of specifics that would torpedo him as Warren and Sanders may be torpedoed."
Ball State economist Michael Hicks, who has been following Buttigieg's campaign, said the mayor's spending proposals are progressive but aren't filled with "big, crazy numbers."
He proposes to spend around $2 trillion to fight climate change. By comparison, Sanders would spend $16.3 trillion. Biden would spend $5 trillion.
Buttigieg's Medicare expansion — $150 billion or so a year — assumes most people will keep their private insurance. It's a smart move, Hicks said, especially in the Midwest where union workers have negotiated health care as part of their salary packages. The leading moderate candidate, Biden, in fact, has taken to aping Buttigieg's phrase — "Medicare for all who want it" — when describing his own health care plan.
Hicks suspects Buttigieg will stick to the middle path by suggesting reallocating existing resources to pay for many of his proposals. Whether that's practical or not in the real world will depend on whether Buttigieg would be able to negotiate with the various lobbies with their hands in the cookie jar.
But for the most part, Hicks thinks Buttigieg's proposals appear to be more practical than those of several of his rivals.
"Compared to Elizabeth Warren, who has seemingly a policy for everything, it's as if someone who has actually seen a federal budget is looking at Pete Buttigieg's numbers," Hicks said. "It may just be the practicality of having been a mayor."
But, the truth will be in the details. And so far, those have been sparse.

Texto completo: If life is best lived with a hefty helping of common sense and a gob of humor, American humorist, actor and woodworker Nick Offerman is living the dream. His life's creed played out on a warm fall afternoon as he sensibly maneuvered his car to the side of the Pacific Coast Highway before accepting our phone call. This week he'll command the stage at The Louisville Palace and in advance of his show, the actor, best known as Ron Swanson on NBC's seven seasons of "Parks and Recreation," wants to talk about his favorite Kentuckiana and why he loves performing in front of a live audience. "I am presently driving down the California coast so I have safely pulled off to the side where we should have uninterrupted reception. I have full bars on my phone. I am looking out at the Pacific Ocean," he told The Courier Journal. "Hello to you." Wait, are we talking to Offerman or his Ron Swanson character? Does it matter?
The no-nonsense greeting is a revealing peek into what the Louisville audience can expect during Offerman's "All Rise" multi-city live tour which includes a stop Friday in downtown Louisville.
Offerman promises to step onto the Louisville Palace stage with his guitar, his backpack, his humor and also, as an added bonus, his dancing feet.
"Yes there will be some light dancing on my part, the amount will depend on the level of mirth achieved on a given evening and usually the Palace in Louisville is pretty heavy in mirth," he said with his signature giggle before taking a more serious tone. "My aim in this undertaking is to encourage my fellow Homo sapiens to aim higher in life than the channels of consumerism would have us imagine."
Minus the dancing, it's a sentiment that falls in line with Offerman's decades-long admiration of Kentucky author Wendell Berry.
"I got turned onto his fiction first in the mid-90s," said Offerman. "I was doing a play in Chicago and someone gave me his short stories and I immediately recognized him as the wealthiest source of common sense that I have ever come across with healthy dollops of affection and humor. "
In the years since, Offerman has become friends with the prolific Kentucky author whose book, "The Unsettling of America," argues that responsible, small-scale agriculture is essential to the preservation of the land and the culture.
"They are doing the best work that needs to be done," said Offerman, who has visited the Berry family at their home in Henry County. "I have spent a great deal of my professional life trying to get people to pay attention to his writing."
A writer himself, Offerman has published four books which are all New York Times Bestsellers: "The Greatest Love Story Ever Told" — with his wife actress Megan Mullally (Will & Grace), "Paddle Your Own Canoe: One Man's Fundamentals for Delicious Living," "Gumption: Relighting the Torch of Freedom with America's Gutsiest Troublemakers" and "Good Clean Fun: Misadventures in Sawdust at Offerman Woodshop."
As if acting, performing live shows and writing aren't enough to keep the Illinois native humming like a buzzsaw, he also owns and operates The Offerman Workshop in East Los Angeles.
Along with a small team of accomplished woodworkers, Offerman builds hand-crafted items like canoes, backgammon boards and furniture made from fallen trees from the urban Los Angeles environment as well as greater California and Oregon.
Offerman brings his woodworking skills to the small screen as the co-host of NBC's "Making It," alongside fellow Parks and Rec alum Amy Poehler. The reality building competition premieres its second season on Dec. 2.
"I guess it seems like I do a lot, but really, I am just doing things that I really love," Offerman said. "For instance this year I had a gut feeling that I needed to do something to help my fellow Americans laugh a little because people are really down in the mouth."
Which led to the humorist penning the comedy material, a "bunch of funny songs" and choreographing the "light dance" moves for his third official comedy tour "All Rise."
"I hope you'll all come out of the show," he said. "I love Louisville and I will keep limbered up so that you get the whole complement of moves and mirth at the Palace."

Texto completo: Under a "state-created danger" legal doctrine, a judge ordered the government to provide counseling and other services to compensate for trauma.
LOS ANGELES -- A federal judge has ruled that the government must provide mental health services to thousands of migrant parents and children who experienced psychological harm as a result of the Trump administration's practice of separating families.
The decision, issued late Tuesday, marks a rare instance of the government being held legally accountable for mental trauma brought about by its policies -- in this case, border security measures that locked thousands of migrant parents in detention while their children were placed in government shelters or foster homes.
"This is truly groundbreaking," Erwin Chemerinsky, dean of the University of California Berkeley School of Law, said of the decision. "The court is recognizing that when a government creates a danger that inflicts trauma, the government is responsible for providing a solution. It is not something I have seen a court do before."
Judge John A. Kronstadt of the United States District Court in Los Angeles ordered the federal government to immediately make available mental health screenings and treatment to thousands of families forcibly separated under the policy, which was primarily carried out in 2017 and 2018 -- though hundreds of similar separations still occur.
In his ruling, Judge Kronstadt referred to previous federal cases that found that governments can be held liable when with "deliberate indifference" they place people in dangerous situations. In the past, the "state-created danger" doctrine has been applied when a police officer ejected a person from a bar late at night in very cold weather, or when a public employer failed to address toxic mold that caused workers to fall ill.
In this case, the judge said, the Trump administration could be held accountable for the enduring psychological harm brought about by forcibly taking children from their parents at the border with no guarantee of when or how they would be reunited.
Thousands of parents spent months in often agonizing limbo, plaintiffs in the case argued, unable to communicate with their children and in many cases not knowing even where the children were being held.
The judge's preliminary injunction will require the government to arrange mental health screenings along with psychological counseling and other services, perhaps long term. The process could be cumbersome and expensive because thousands of migrants who were affected by the policy are spread across the country and are in various stages of immigration court proceedings. Many already have been deported and would presumably not be eligible for any mental health care.
Carl Tobias, a professor of law at the University of Richmond, who specializes in federal courts, called the decision "pathbreaking."
"The question is," he said, "what happens from here and can it be enforced? I assume the government will appeal and get the order stayed because it's brand new. They'll say the judge got it wrong."
The family separations were a key part of the Trump administration's effort to deter migrant families at the southwestern border, where they have been arriving in large numbers, most of them fleeing violence and deep poverty in Central America.
Under the zero-tolerance policy, those who crossed the border illegally were criminally prosecuted and jailed, a process that the government said could not be carried out without removing their children.
The federal government had reported that nearly 3,000 children were forcibly removed from their parents under the policy. An additional 1,556 migrant families were separated between July 2017 and June 2018, the government said last month.
President Trump suspended the policy in June 2018 amid a public outcry, and a federal judge in San Diego ordered the government to reunify the families.
But Judge Kronstadt found that the government had taken "affirmative steps to implement the zero-tolerance policy," and that its implementation had caused "severe mental trauma to parents and their children."
Mark Rosenbaum, a lawyer with Public Counsel, which brought the case along with the law firm Sidley Austin, said the judge had found that the separation policy violated the families' constitutional rights.
"You cannot have a policy of deliberately trying to injure a family bond," he said. "Cruelty cannot be part of an enforcement policy, and here it was the cornerstone of the policy."
Government lawyers had argued that it could not be held liable for mental health problems that might occur in the future, and that there had been no proof of existing irreparable harm to any of those subjected to the policy.
Further, they said that any harm that might have occurred was quickly abated when families were reunited.
The government declined to comment on the court's ruling.
The lead plaintiff in the case, a Guatemalan migrant identified as J.P., was separated from her teenage daughter at the border on May 21, 2018. For more than a month, the mother said, she had no idea of her child's whereabouts. They spoke for the first time after they had been apart for 40 days, and only because a lawyer encountered J.P. during a visit to the detention center in Irvine, Calif., where she was being held.
Until then, no one had explained to her in a language she could understand -- she speaks a Mayan language -- what had happened to her daughter, according to her lawyer, Judy London, who is with Public Counsel. Her daughter, 16, had been sent to a shelter in Phoenix.
"Despite her obvious terror and inability to comprehend what was happening around her, no one made sure she had understood information about how she could contact her daughter," Ms. London said in a declaration filed with the court.
"To the contrary, the guards insisted she needed no help and could on her own use phones to reach her daughter," she said.
Their reunion two months later, when her daughter arrived on a flight to Hollywood Burbank Airport near Los Angeles, was witnessed by The New York Times.
The woman, dressed in the black jacket and trousers she had worn during her journey over land to the United States, waited for her daughter's plane to land. When the girl emerged, J.P. hugged her, cradled her in her arms and stroked her hair as the child wept on her shoulder.
They are living in Florida as their asylum case winds through the immigration courts.

Texto completo: He had a "ringside seat to history" in the South, befriending Martin Luther King and triggering a landmark First Amendment case that went to the Supreme Court.
Ray Jenkins, the city editor of The Alabama Journal, was eating a bologna sandwich at his desk on April 5, 1960, and thumbing through a week-old copy of The New York Times when a full-page ad caught his eye.
Prominent liberals, including Eleanor Roosevelt and Jackie Robinson, were appealing for money for a legal-defense fund for the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, who was facing a trial in Alabama on perjury charges -- a good local angle for The Journal.
The ad, titled "Heed Their Rising Voices," castigated Alabama officials for what it called "an unprecedented wave of terror" against leaders of the civil rights movement.
Within minutes, Mr. Jenkins tapped out 13 paragraphs about the ad; his article appeared in the paper that afternoon.
Apparently no one else had noticed the ad until then -- The Times sold 394 papers a day in Alabama in 1960. And so Alabama officials were startled and enraged after reading Mr. Jenkins's report, which pointed out that the ad contained some factual errors.
They filed a libel suit against The Times, which ended four years later in a landmark ruling by the United States Supreme Court in the paper's favor. The case, New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, made it harder for public officials to sue for defamation and remains a bedrock legal principal upholding freedom of the press.
Mr. Jenkins died on Oct. 24 at his home in Baltimore. He was 89. His wife, Bettina Jenkins, said the cause was congestive heart failure.
Mr. Jenkins always expressed amazement that his short, routine article about the Times ad -- the piece didn't even carry his byline -- would prove so important. When he retired in 1991 from journalism after a distinguished 40-year career, he said it was "the most significant story I ever wrote."
By then he had already won a Pulitzer Prize as a young journalist in the South, served as editorial page editor of The Baltimore Evening Sun, been named a Nieman fellow at Harvard and worked for two years as a press aide to President Jimmy Carter.
While living in Montgomery, Ala., where The Journal was based, Mr. Jenkins covered the civil rights movement and developed a close relationship with Dr. King, then pastor of the city's Dexter Avenue Baptist Church. Nancy Jenkins-Chafin, Mr. Jenkins's daughter, said in a phone interview that the two had spoken regularly in the church's basement and that Mr. Jenkins had written often about Dr. King's vision and mission.
"My father's coverage may have helped to change hearts and minds of Southerners who had been living for generations in a deeply segregated society," she said.
In one of their discussions, recalled by Mr. Jenkins in a column he wrote years later, Dr. King marveled that he, a descendant of slaves, was sitting and talking with Mr. Jenkins, a descendant of slave owners.
Mr. Jenkins asked Dr. King if he might include that thought in a speech some day. Dr. King did, in his "I Have a Dream" speech in Washington in 1963.
"I have a dream," Dr. King said from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, "that one day on the Red Hills of Georgia, sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood."
Carrell Ray Jenkins was born on Sept. 25, 1930, in Sylvester, Ga., about 200 miles south of Atlanta. His mother, Eunice (Thornton) Jenkins, was a homemaker, and his father, Herbert, sold tractors for International Harvester while also farming cotton, corn and tobacco.
Ray was the first in his family to go to college, receiving a bachelor's degree in journalism from the University of Georgia in 1951.
He began his career at The Columbus Ledger in Columbus, Ga., on the border of Alabama, and was a member of a team that won the 1955 Pulitzer Prize for public service for exposing political corruption in neighboring Phenix City, Ala.
While living in Columbus, he met Bettina Cirsovius, who had immigrated from Germany in 1952. They were married in 1956.
In addition to her and their daughter, Mr. Jenkins is survived by their sons, Sam and Mark, and four grandchildren.
Mr. Jenkins was named city editor of The Alabama Journal in 1959 and spent the next two decades covering the civil rights movement. But of all the articles he wrote and edited, the one he dashed off about the Times advertisement would prove to be one of the most consequential.
The ad never named any of the officials that it was taking to task, and the newspaper publicly apologized for the factual errors. Still, several Alabama officials, including L.B. Sullivan, the Montgomery city commissioner, who supervised the police, contended that they had been defamed by inference and filed suit against The Times.
"If the officials could win, they would almost certainly silence the civil rights movement in Alabama -- as well as the newspaper that consistently covered it," Gene Roberts and Hank Klibanoff wrote in "The Race Beat," which chronicled the news coverage of the civil rights era and won the 2007 Pulitzer Prize in history. "Silence, not money, was the goal."
For a time, the lawsuits had their intended effect. Lawyers for The Times told the paper to keep its reporters out of Alabama while the matter was in litigation.
The Times lost in the lower courts. But on appeal to the Supreme Court, the newspaper prevailed.
In a unanimous 1964 ruling, the court held that the First Amendment protects newspapers even when they print a false statement, unless a complainant can prove that the newspaper had made the statement with "'actual malice' -- that is, with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not."
Mr. Jenkins was not involved in the case but was interested in the law. He took night classes and in 1977 received his law degree from the Thomas Goode Jones School of Law, now part of Faulkner University in Montgomery.
He became managing editor of The Journal, then editorial page editor and in 1978 was named executive editor of both The Journal and The Montgomery Advertiser, sister papers owned by the same company.
When the papers were sold soon thereafter, Jody Powell, President Carter's press secretary, offered Mr. Jenkins a job at the White House. Mr. Jenkins worked in the press office until Mr. Carter lost his re-election bid in 1980. (The Journal closed in 1993.)
He joined The Baltimore Evening Sun in 1981, becoming a columnist and editor of the editorial page. Over the years he also wrote frequently for The Times. After his retirement he continued to write columns and essays, often about civil rights. He also wrote "Blind Vengeance: The Roy Moody Mail Bomb Murders" (1997), about mail bombs sent in 1989 that killed a federal judge in Alabama and a civil rights lawyer in Georgia.
In a tribute to Mr. Jenkins in The Sun, Ernest F. Imhoff, a retired editor of the newspaper, said, "Ray was a fine Southern gentleman who offered us a bit of guidance and wisdom from another time that helped us as Northerners understand that part of the country a lot better."

Texto completo: Sweater weather is here, and that means soup's for dinner.
An LNP archive dive found soup recipes to satisfy any craving. There are creamy soups and tomato soups. There’s a venison stew and a minestrone. There’s a crab chowder, a chicken corn soup and a few more. And there’s a recipe from The New York Times that caused a sensation earlier this year.
------------
Venison Stew with Noodles
Ingredients:
* 2-3 pounds venison steak cut into strips (can be replaced with beef)
* 2 cans tomato soup
* 1 can water
* 1 onion cut in small wedges
* 1 green bell pepper cut into strips
* 2 tablespoons soy sauce
* 2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
Directions:
Place all the ingredients into a slow cooker and cook on low 6-8 hours. Thicken if you like, and serve over buttered noodles.
------------
Spiced Chickpea Stew with Coconut and Turmeric
Start to finish: 55 minutes
Servings: 4 to 6
Ingredients:
* 1/4 cup olive oil, plus more for serving
* 4 garlic cloves, chopped
* 1 yellow onion, chopped
* 1 (2-inch) piece ginger, finely chopped
* Kosher salt and black pepper
* 1 1/2 teaspoons ground turmeric, plus more for serving
* 1 teaspoon red pepper flakes, plus more for serving
* 2 (15-ounce) cans chickpeas, drained and rinsed
* 2 (15-ounce) cans full-fat coconut milk
* 2 cups vegetable or chicken stock
* 1 bunch Swiss chard, kale or collard greens, stems removed, torn into bite-sized pieces
* 1 cup mint leaves, for serving
* Yogurt, for serving (optional)
* Toasted pita, lavash or other flatbread, for serving (optional)
Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add garlic, onion and ginger. Season with salt and pepper and cook, stirring occasionally until onion is translucent and starts to brown a little around the edges, 3 to 5 minutes.
Add turmeric, red pepper flakes and chickpeas, and season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring frequently, so the chickpeas sizzle and fry a bit in the spices and oil, until they’ve started to break down and get a little browned and crisp, 5 to 8 minutes. Remove about a cup of chickpeas and set aside for garnish.
Add coconut milk and stock to the remaining chickpeas in the pot, and season with salt and pepper. Bring to a simmer, scraping up any bits that have formed on the bottom of the pot. Cook, stirring occasionally, until stew has thickened and flavors have started to come together, 30 to 35 minutes. (Taste a chickpea or two, not just the liquid, to make sure they have simmered long enough to taste as delicious as possible.)
Add greens and stir, making sure they’re submerged in the liquid. Cook a few minutes so they wilt and soften, 3 to 7 minutes, depending on what you’re using. (Swiss chard and spinach will wilt and soften much faster than kale or collard greens.) Season again with salt and pepper.
Divide among bowls and top with mint, reserved chickpeas, a sprinkle of red pepper flakes and a good drizzle of olive oil. Serve alongside yogurt and toasted pita if using; dust the yogurt with turmeric if you’d like.
— This recipe by New York Times writer Alison Roman was widely shared and praised by readers on social media.

Drain and mix in tomatoes and pumpkin. Season with chili powder, cumin, pepper and salt. Reduce heat to low, cover and simmer 20 minutes. Serve topped with cheddar cheese and sour cream. Sprinkle minced cilantro over top if desired.

Tomato Basil Soup
Ingredients:
* 1 onion, peeled and thinly sliced
* 2 tablespoons olive oil
* 2 cups chicken broth (regular or low-sodium)
* 6 medium tomatoes, peeled and quartered (about 2 pounds)
* 1 (6-ounce) can tomato paste

Seared Broccoli and Potato Soup
Start to finish: 45 minutes
Servings: 4 to 6
Ingredients:
* 1/2 cup olive oil, plus more as needed
* 2 heads broccoli (about 2 pounds), separated into small florets, stems peeled and diced
* 2 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, more to taste
* 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
* 1 large Spanish onion, diced
* 5 cloves garlic, chopped
* 1/2 teaspoons black pepper, more for finishing
* 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes
* 1/2 pound potatoes, peeled and thinly sliced
* 1/4 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest
* 1 1/2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice, more to taste
* Grated Parmesan, to finish
* Flaky sea salt, to finish
In a large soup pot, heat 2 tablespoons of oil over high heat. Add about a third of the broccoli, just enough so that it covers the bottom of the pan in a single layer without overcrowding. Cook broccoli without moving it for about 3 to 4 minutes, or until dark brown on 1 side only (leave the other side bright green). Transfer to a big bowl and repeat with remaining broccoli and more oil. When all the broccoli has been browned, season with 1 teaspoon salt and set aside.
Reduce heat to medium-low. Add butter and remaining 2 tablespoons of oil to pan. Add onions and garlic, black and red peppers, and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Cook onion-garlic mixture until soft and translucent, about 4 minutes. Add potato to the pot with 1 quart water and remaining 1 teaspoon salt. Bring to a simmer, cover pot and cook until potato is just tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Add broccoli, cover again and cook until tender, another 5 to 10 minutes.
Add lemon zest and roughly purée soup with an immersion or regular blender, leaving some small chunks for texture. Stir in lemon juice. Finish with grated Parmesan, a drizzle of olive oil, black pepper and flaky sea salt.

Texto completo: Mexico City • The seven-month-old baby Faith Marie Johnson survived hours without food and water in a bullet-ridden SUV in northern Mexico until her family members arrived. She had miraculously escaped the bullets flying around her. Her mother was among the three women and six children killed on Monday when gunmen ambushed their cars after they left a nearby Mormon community. Five other children survived being shot in the back, jaw, leg, wrist and chest.
Those killed were all American citizens. The attack has sparked outrage from Mexico to Utah to the White House and focused American attention once again on violence south of the border.
Mexican prosecutors blamed cartels fighting a turf war over the lucrative routes smuggling drugs to Americans for the massacre. They said the Mormon families may have been targeted in a case of mistaken identity. Members of that Mormon community have also been outspoken against crime, including Julian LeBarón, who helped rescue the baby from the car. I found LeBarón to be one of the most inspiring speakers at a series of protests against violence I followed across Mexico in 2011. But the violence has only gotten worse since then.
President Trump responded to the attack on Monday with a series of tweets, calling the cartels “monsters” and offering to help defeat them.
“The cartels have become so large and powerful that you sometimes need an army to defeat an army!” he wrote. “This is the time for Mexico, with the help of the United States, to wage WAR on the drug cartels and wipe them off the face of the earth.”
The president was correct that Mexico’s drug cartels are immensely powerful and engage in monstrous attacks on civilians, which have caused a humanitarian catastrophe here. But he did not say that the United States had already been helping to bankroll a Mexican military crackdown on traffickers since 2008 under a plan known as the Merida Initiative. And perhaps more important, he failed to mention that cartels sow their terror with American guns.
Between 2007 and 2018, more than 150,000 firearms were definitively traced from Mexican criminals to gun stores and factories in the United States. Many times more are believed to still be in the hands of the cartels. Last year, 70 percent of the weapons that Mexican security forces captured and submitted to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, or A.T.F., were confirmed to be made or sold in the United States.
The weapons include thousands of Kalashnikovs and AR-15s, which the cartels can convert to fully automatic, as an A.T.F. firearms expert explained during the trial of Joaquin Guzman, known as El Chapo, a Mexican drug kingpin now in a maximum security federal prison in Colorado. They also include hundreds of .50-caliber sniper rifles, which fire bullets the size of knives that can cut through armor.
On Oct. 17, cartel thugs used these types of rifles to attack Mexican troops after Guzman’s son was arrested in the city of Culiacán; an army video shows a soldier’s leg blown off. In another massacre last month, gangsters fired .50-caliber bullets in an ambush that killed 13 police officers in the state of Michoacan.
These outsized weapons are sold in shops in several states throughout the United States. ATF agents have caught several people involved in smuggling them to Mexico, including one couple sentenced last month in Tucson, Ariz.
Trump agreed to fight the gun trafficking on a call with President Andrés Manuel López Obrador of Mexico on Oct. 19, according to Mexican officials. But if he really wants to do that, he needs to back proposals in Congress that have widespread support among Americans. These include the Bipartisan Background Checks Act, a bill that would close a loophole that allows traffickers to get weapons, which the House approved in February but the Senate has stalled. A poll published in July found that 89 percent of respondents support mandatory background checks for gun purchases.
Other measures Trump should support include a bill to make it harder to steal firearms from shops and another bill that would make it harder to build weapons from kits. None of this legislation would stop law-abiding Americans buying firearms, but these bills would make it tougher for cartels to arm up — and continue murdering people.
Of course, the sources of Mexico’s crime problem are complex. And the government here has work to do, too, including making greater efforts to fight the corruption and impunity that enable cartels. To start, López Obrador needs a coherent security strategy; his call for “hugs not bullets” is clearly not working. But it is so much more difficult for the Mexican security forces to get the edge over gangsters who blow through their vehicles with .50-calibers and have an unlimited supply of rifles.
Trump has a point when he says that cartels are a bloodthirsty menace that can be compared to an army. But to act on that, he needs to reduce the iron pipeline of gunmetal that makes them so formidable. That power is in his hands.

THERE'S NOTHING SINISTER ABOUT SOCIALISM

Texto completo: Eight years ago, my colleague John Nichols wrote a book titled, "The 'S' Word: A Short History of an American Tradition...Socialism."
"Socialist ideas, now so frequently dismissed not just by the Tories of the present age but by political media elites that diminish and deny our history, have shaped and strengthened America across the past two centuries," he wrote back in 2011.
That doesn't mean that America is a socialist country, he added, "but it does mean that, to know America, to understand and appreciate the whole of this country's past, its present and perhaps its future, we must recognize the socialist threads that have been woven into our national tapestry."
I was reminded of John's book while reading a recent column in the New York Times by Dan Kaufman, the Madison West High grad, New Yorker contributor and author of the best-selling book, "The Fall of Wisconsin: The Conservative Conquest of a Progressive Bastion and the Future of American Politics."
Like Nichols did in his book, Kaufman recalls the decades-long era of the Milwaukee "sewer Socialists" in a column headlined: "The City Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez Would Have Loved to Live In," a reference, of course, to Sen. Bernie Sanders and U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, both of whom have been mocked by Republicans and some Democrats as dreaded socialists.
Actually, as Kaufman observes in his column, the experiments with socialism in this country weren't dreaded at all.
In fact, Milwaukee flourished under socialism. When socialists won 21 of 35 city council seats and the mayor's office in 1910 (and sent 14 socialists to the state Legislature) the city embarked on unprecedented reform.
"There was no need to go on a 'listening tour' to find out what the working class wanted, since so many of the party's newly-elected officials were workers themselves," Kaufman pointed out. "They installed hundreds of drinking fountains, prosecuted restaurateurs for serving tainted food and compelled factory owners to put in heating systems and toilets."
The city's socialist mayor, Emil Seidel, appointed an aggressive new health commissioner, whose department, Kaufman noted, "oversaw a reduction of more than 40% of cases of the six leading contagious diseases, among them scarlet fever, whooping cough and smallpox within two years."
But, what was even more significant was the socialists' integrity.
"They never were approached by the lobbyists, because the lobbyists knew it was not possible to influence these men," Kaufman quotes William Evjue, then a member of the state Assembly before founding The Capital Times.
It was a stark contrast to the corruption that had permeated so much of the state's political process at the turn of the 20th century.
The Milwaukee socialists, who became known as the "sewer socialists" because of their concentration on building and improving infrastructure, suffered a setback in 1912, but regained control in 1916. New socialist mayor Daniel Hoan was elected and served until 1940, presiding over more civic improvements, including adding miles of parkland to Milwaukee's lake front.
Socialist Frank Zeidler became mayor in 1948 and survived U.S. Sen. Joe McCarthy's Red Scare, during which socialists were subjected to absurd charges about their Americanism as some are today.
The truth is that American socialists held and continue to hold views about how government should serve the people remarkably similar to what Democratic President Franklin D. Roosevelt and his successor, Harry Truman, believed. Everything from Social Security to Medicare are socialist ideas. So are public housing, public parks systems, and, yes, adequate water systems and sewers.
Many of today's politicians suggest that there's something sinister about socialists, suggesting that the ideology is something akin to communism. Nothing could be further from the truth.
Their bottom line is economic equality. It's what they stood for in Milwaukee's heyday, and it's what they stand for today. CREDIT: By Dave Zweifel

Texto completo: John Leguizamo ha pasado el año haciendo algo que muchos calificarían como un acto desafiante: viajar a lo largo de Estados Unidos con un monólogo que reivindica el papel de los latinos en la historia de EE.UU.
Es de asumir que el público que paga una entrada para ver 95 minutos de su espectáculo admira al actor, pero no siempre ha sido así.
* ¿Hablas español? Sigue toda nuestra cobertura aquí
“Ocasionalmente hay una pareja, que suele ser blanca y un poco mayor en edad, que empieza a molestarse mientras ve el show. Y creen que es su derecho decirme que me devuelva a México o alguna locura así…”, le dijo Leguizamo a BBC Mundo en una conversación reciente en Los Ángeles.
“Por cierto, no soy de México… “, añade con picardía el intérprete de 55 años, que nació en Bogotá y llegó a vivir a la ciudad de Nueva York con apenas 4 años de edad.
Facebook Latin History For MoronsLeguizamo se hace pasar por maestro de escuela en su monólogo “Historia latina para tontos”.
El monólogo, que en 2018 recibió un reconocimiento especial en los Premios Tony de lo mejor del teatro de EE.UU., se titula Latin History for Morons, o “Historia latina para tontos”.
En él, Leguizamo se hace pasar por un maestro de escuela que enseña los episodios de la historia que “no aparecen en los libros escolares”.
La sátira del intérprete aborda, entre otras cosas, la “exterminación” por parte de los colonizadores de los imperios maya y azteca y de los indígenas taínos.
* ¿Cómo sería México si Estados Unidos no se hubiera apropiado de más de la mitad de su territorio en el siglo XIX?
En otro momento, destaca también el papel de latinoamericanos e indígenas en la Guerra de Independencia de EE.UU.
Desde su estreno en Broadway en noviembre de 2017, Leguizamo se ha presentado más de 80 veces y ha recorrido unas 30 ciudades del país.
Con una carrera sólida que ha incluido celebradas interpretaciones en películas y series como Carlito’s Way y When They See Us, Leguizamo no olvida lo difícil que es ser un actor latino en Hollywood.
“Cuando empecé me decía el mánager ‘cámbiate el nombre, actúa como italiano, no te broncees ‘”, describió a una audiencia mayoritariamente latina en el evento Hispanicize, celebrado a mediados de octubre en Los Ángeles.
* De costa a costa, cómo cambia el español que se habla en EE.UU. y qué variedades predominan
Y añadió que cuando presentaba algún proyecto a un grupo de ejecutivos de la industria, recibía comentarios como “ Los latinos no quieren ver historias positivas ” o “los latinos no quieren ver a otros latinos”.
Cada vez que puede, Leguizamo lanza la contundente aseveración de “apartheid cultural” para enmarcar la escasa representación de latinos en ámbitos como el entretenimiento y la política pese a constituir la minoría racial y étnica más numerosa en el país.
Getty ImagesLos actores latinos constituyen el 4,5% de los papeles con diálogos de Hollywood, de acuerdo a un estudio de este año.
“Hollywood está perpetrando imágenes negativas de los latinos como narcos o gánsters que alimentan directamente esa demonización que Trump hace de nosotros “, critica.
Leguizamo se refirió al presidente de EE.UU., Donald Trump, quien busca la reelección en 2020 y desde que inició su mandato en 2016 ha mantenido una retórica negativa contra los inmigrantes indocumentados de Latinoamérica.
Al preguntarle cómo explica ese “apartheid”, arroja estadísticas como dardos: “En Los Ángeles, casi el 50% de la población es latina y constituimos el 4% de caras frente y detrás de cámara. Eso es un apartheid cultural”.
De acuerdo a un estudio de este año de la Universidad del Sur de California, los actores latinos constituyen solo el 4,5% de los roles con diálogos de Hollywood.

Algo similar dice sobre la ciudad de Nueva York, que con un 29% de población latina (los blancos no hispanos constituyen el 32%), “ no hay igualdad en el número de historias que reflejen las realidades de los latinos en diarios como el New York Times“, sentencia.
La opresión de hace siglos de la que habla en su monólogo continúa hoy en día, agrega el actor. Algo con lo que piensa luchar por toda su carrera.
“¿Por qué Hollywood necesita venir a ti? Crea tu propio Hollywood”, dice.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – More than a dozen witnesses have been called before a trio of House committees and questioned for hours about President Donald Trump and Ukraine.
The witnesses include diplomats and White House officials with knowledge of Trump's dealings with Ukraine. Each has provided new details as part of the quickly moving impeachment inquiry examining whether Trump abused his power as president in asking Ukraine to investigate political foes while dangling military aid for the country and a White House meeting. Their testimonies combined span about 100 hours.
Almost a dozen of these witnesses have also appeared publicly before the House Intelligence Committee.
Here are the 17 witnesses who have been interviewed behind closed doors by the House Intelligence, Foreign Affairs and Oversight committees or later testified publicly, why they matter in the impeachment saga and what we know about their testimony.
Oct. 3: Former U. S. special envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker
Why he matters: A career State Department official, Volker worked with Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani and various White House officials to set up Trump's phone call July 25 with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and a potential White House visit. This happened as military aid for the country was on pause.
What he told lawmakers: Volker said he never saw anything that made him believe there was a quid pro quo with Ukraine and said he felt coordinating with Giuliani could change Trump from his negative feelings about Ukraine. His testimony made clear the influence Giuliani had over policy, including Giuliani dictating a statement to Volker that he wanted the Ukrainians to issue on corruption.
In his public testimony Nov. 19, Volker told lawmakers he was not aware of or knowingly took part in any efforts to pressure Kyiv to open an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden. At the time, he told lawmakers, he did not realize investigations into the Bidens and into Burisma had been conflated.
Oct. 11: Former Ukraine ambassador Marie Yovanovitch
Why she matters: A career diplomat, Yovanovitch was forced out of her role.
What she told lawmakers: Yovanovitch was confused by her ouster and the comments made by conservatives and Trump, who called her "bad news. " She said she raised concerns about the shadow campaign pushed by Giuliani and how it ran counter to U. S. policy.
In her Nov. 15 public hearing, Yovanovitchhow she felt after being ousted as ambassador amid the "smear" campaign against her.
When asked how it felt to be told to leave Ukraine as quickly as possible, she said it felt “terrible, honestly. After 33 years of service to our country it was terrible. It's not the way I wanted my career to end. ”
Oct. 14: Trump's former Russia expert Fiona Hill
Why she matters: Hill worked for years on the National Intelligence Council and as Trump's senior adviser on the Kremlin and Europe. She held a key role in U. S. policy in Ukraine and was part of several meetings where she expressed concerns over the shadow policy led by Giuliani and White House acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney.
What she told lawmakers: Hill told lawmakers national security adviser John Bolton likened the policy in Ukraine to a "drug deal" and called Giuliani a "hand grenade" who was going to blow everyone up, according to The New York Times and NBC News.
In her Nov. 21 public testimony, Hill slammed the "fictional narrative" of Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election. Congressional Republicans have argued Ukraine colluded with Democrats to hurt Trump in the election.
Oct. 15: State Department Ukraine-Russia expert George Kent
Why he matters: Kent serves as a deputy assistant secretary at the State Department.
What he told lawmakers: Kent told lawmakers he raised red flags about Giuliani's efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden more than six months ago.
In his public testimony, Kent said the Ukrainian oligarch owner of gas company Burisma should be investigated over allegations of paying a bribe to kill a probe into the company.
Oct. 16: Michael McKinley, ex-adviser to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo
Why he matters: McKinley boasted a career that spanned decades at the State Department and resigned just before his testimony because of low morale at the department and because he said Pompeo did not stick up for career employees, such as Yovanovitch.
What he told lawmakers: McKinley didn't oversee issues related to Ukraine, so his testimony did not deal with the core allegations against Trump. He outlined his concerns about the ouster of Yovanovitch and said he was troubled that the State Department did not have her back and that she and the department were being politicized.
Oct. 17: U. S. ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland
Why he matters: A businessman and major Trump donor, Sondland was in communication with the president and Giuliani and attempted to get Ukrainians to investigate several political matters, according to witnesses.
What he told lawmakers: Sondland amended his original testimony and told lawmakers he communicated a quid pro quo to a Ukrainian official, linking military aid for Ukraine to a public statement committing to investigations Trump and Giuliani wanted.
In his Nov. 20 public testimony, Sondland gave more details not previously included in his closed-door interview, telling lawmakers that "everyone was in the loop" on the pressure campaign – including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Vice President Mike Pence.
Oct. 22: Bill Taylor, top U. S. diplomat in Ukraine
Why he matters: Taylor voiced concerns about conditioning military aid and a White House meeting on political investigations.
What he told lawmakers: Taylor directly tied Trump and his allies with a quid pro quo. He said Trump made the order to pause military aid for Ukraine, and it was his "clear understanding" that "security assistance money would not come until the (Ukrainian) president committed to pursue the investigation," according to a transcript of his testimony.
In his public hearing, Taylor gave new testimony saying one of his aides overheard a call between Trump and Sondland in which Trump asked Sondland about "investigations," which caused Trump to deny the conversation.
Oct. 23: Defense official Laura Cooper
Why she matters: Cooper serves as the deputy assistant secretary of defense for Russia, Ukraine and Eurasia.
What she told lawmakers: Behind closed doors, Cooper gave lawmakers further details about the withholding of aid.
In her Nov. 21 public testimony, Cooper provided new details about emails from the Ukrainians showing they had concerns about security assistance on July 25 – the day of Trump's infamous call with Zelensky.
Oct. 26: State Department official Philip Reeker
Why he matters: Reeker serves as the acting assistant secretary of state in the Bureau of European and Eurasian Affairs.
What he told lawmakers: According to The Wall Street Journal, he discussed with lawmakers failed efforts to help Yovanovitch.
Oct. 29: Ukraine expert Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman
Why he matters: Vindman is one of several officials who listened to Trump's phone call with Zelensky on July 25. He served as the White House's top Ukraine expert.
What he told lawmakers: Vindman said in prepared remarks he twice reported concerns to superiors that the president and those working for him linked foreign aid to Ukraine with political investigations. He said he worried the efforts undermined U. S. national security.
In his public testimony on Nov. 20, Vindman said he reported his concerns about a July 10 meeting between Sondland and Ukrainian officials, as well as Trump's July 25 call with Zelensky, out of a sense of duty.
"I was concerned by the call," Vindman said. "What I heard was inappropriate. "
Oct. 30: State Department official Catherine Croft
Why she matters: Croft worked for Volker at the State Department and has expertise on Ukrainian issues. She focused on arms sales and security assistance for the country as it fended off Russia.
What she told lawmakers: According to a copy of her opening statement, Croft told lawmakers she received calls from a lobbyist trying to oust Yovanovitch. She said she learned that aid was put on hold stemming from an order from the president.
Oct. 30: State Department official Christopher Anderson
Why he matters: Anderson worked for Volker at the State Department and was present for at least one meeting where political investigations were discussed.
What he told lawmakers: In his opening statement, Anderson said Giuliani's efforts were discussed at a Ukraine strategy meeting over the summer. At that meeting, Bolton said Giuliani's efforts "could be an obstacle. " Anderson said he believed it was important to not request specific investigations from the Ukrainians.
Oct. 31: NSC official Timothy Morrison
Why he matters: Morrison is the top Russia and European adviser to Trump's National Security Council and was cited by multiple witnesses in conversations about a quid pro quo. He is a political appointee and not a career official.
What he told lawmakers: Morrison confirmed testimony given by Taylor that outlined a quid pro quo, basically halting aid until Ukraine committed to investigations. Morrison testified that he didn't believe Trump's call July 25 was illegal.
In his Nov. 19 public testimony, Morrison said fellow NSC staffer Fiona Hill warned him of the “Gordon problem” regarding Sondland’s dealings in Ukraine.
Nov. 6: State Department's David Hale
Why he matters: Hale is the third highest-ranking official at the State Department.
What he told lawmakers: Hale told lawmakers about the political considerations in dismissing Yovanovitch and how those decisions affected military aid for Ukraine.
In his Nov. 20 public testimony, Hale said the State Department's decision not to issue a statement of support for Yovanovitch could only be made by someone "more senior to me. The Secretary most likely would have been the person. "
Nov. 7: Pence aide Jennifer Williams
Why she matters: A foreign policy aide to Vice President Mike Pence, Williams was one of a handful of officials who listened to Trump's July 25 call with the Ukrainian president.
What she told lawmakers: In her closed-door interview, Williams told lawmakers and staff it was “folly” to withhold military aid to Ukraine and that the call was “unusual. ”
In her Nov. 19 public testimony, Williams said she found Trump’s July 25 phone call “unusual” because of the discussion of “a domestic political matter. ”
Nov. 15: State Department official David Holmes
Why he matters: In his public testimony, Taylor told lawmakers about a call one of his aides, later identified to be Holmes, overheard between Trump and Sondland in which Trump asked Sondland about "investigations. "
What he told lawmakers: Holmes confirmed he overheard the call and that he "heard President Trump ask, 'So, he's gonna do the investigation?' Ambassador Sondland replied that 'he's gonna do it,' adding that President Zelensky will do 'anything you ask him to. '"
In his Nov. 21 public testimony, Holmes said U. S. foreign policy towards Ukraine "became overshadowed by a political agenda being promoted" by Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, and a "cadre of officials operating with a direct channel to the White House. "
Nov. 16: White House official Mark Sandy
Why he matters: Sandy a White House official in the Office of Management and Budget, is the first OMB official to testify in the inquiry.
What he told lawmakers: Documents presented during the deposition of Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Laura Cooper showed that Sandy signed one of the "apportionment" letters in July 2019 halting security assistance to Ukraine.
Democrats allege Trump tied the aid and a White House meeting to requests for investigations that benefited him politically.

Obama's EPA chief to lead climate group

Texto completo: An environmental group that has sued the Trump administration nearly 100 times announced on Tuesday that it has hired Gina McCarthy, who was the leader of the Environmental Protection Agency under President Barack Obama, to be its new president and chief executive.
In a phone interview Tuesday, McCarthy, who headed the EPA from July 2013 until January 2017, said she was joining the Natural Resources Defense Council to fight for stronger environmental protections and address the challenge of climate change.
"I really didn't want to sit on the sidelines. So the question was where to go," she said, adding that the current administration "is trying to undo not only fundamental protections that have been in place under multiple administrations, but it's undermining the science and the work of scientists to protect the environment and the public."
She added that she's particularly concerned about policies aimed at limiting the kind of scientific studies that can be used in rulemaking and those that change the makeup of scientific advisory boards, as well as plans to relocate agencies outside Washington. "It's not as much about the rollbacks, but it's diminishing the capacity of federal agencies to do their job."
McCarthy, who served as the EPA's air policy chief for four years before becoming administrator, helped craft many of the landmark climate policies that the current administration is unraveling. She also worked on the 2015 Paris climate accord, which the United States formally began withdrawing from Monday.
Since Donald Trump has taken office, the NRDC has emerged as one of the most aggressive groups challenging his administration's work to roll back federal climate rules and bolster policies aimed at promoting energy exploration and other forms of development. It has sued the federal government 96 times on issues such as endangered species, energy efficiency standards for lightbulbs, and more. According to the group, it has won 54 of the 59 cases that have been resolved so far.
McCarthy, a 65 year-old Massachusetts native who was hailed by conservationists but denounced by many energy industry officials during her time in office, has criticized President Trump and his deputies. After leaving the Obama administration, she joined the faculty of Harvard University's T.H. Chan School of Public Health as a public health professor.

Library denied New York Times subscription
The librarians of Citrus County, Fla., had what seemed like a modest wish: a digital subscription to the New York Times. For about $2,700 annually, they reasoned, they could offer an easy way for their roughly 70,000 patrons to research and catch up on the news.
But when their request came before the Citrus County Commission last month, local officials literally laughed out loud. One commissioner, Scott Carnahan, declared the paper to be "fake news."
"I agree with President Trump," he said. "I will not be voting for this. I don't want The New York Times in this county."
In a move that is now generating intense online backlash, all five members of the commission agreed to reject the library's request. The discussion took place on Oct. 24, the same day when the Trump administration announced plans to cancel federal agencies' subscriptions to the Times and The Washington Post. While there's no apparent connection — the Citrus County meeting began several hours before The Wall Street Journal broke the news of the new edict — the controversy unfolding in central Florida highlights how politicians nationwide are parroting the president's disparaging rhetoric about the media.
While the Citrus County Commission is technically nonpartisan, the area, located amid the swamps and springs north of Tampa, is deeply conservative.
Suggesting that a lack of resources wasn't the problem, Carnahan said that the library could take the thousands of dollars that an institutional subscription to the Times would cost and “do something else with it." And community members who really wanted to read the paper could simply sign up for home delivery.
Afterward, two commissioners who hadn't spoken up during the meeting told the Citrus County Chronicle that they worried that agreeing to pay for the Times would lead to requests for subscriptions to more "radical publications."
The Chronicle noted that the four commissioners who agreed to be interviewed said that they did not read the Times.
Unsurprisingly, the commission's decision came as a disappointment.
"Someone's personal political view does not have a place in deciding what library resources are available for the entire county," Sandy Price, the chairwoman for the library's advisory board, told the Chronicle. "Libraries have to ensure all points of view are represented."

Texto completo: Champs become anotherTrump-era flash point after White House visit
Over 14 seasons in Washington, first baseman Ryan Zimmerman earned the nickname "Mr. National" as the face of the city's professional baseball team. But on Monday, his Wikipedia page was briefly vandalized to stick him with a new moniker: "Mr. Nationalist."
If Zimmerman was the target of an anonymous editor angered by the ballplayer's praise of President Trump at a White House ceremony earlier in the day, catcher Kurt Suzuki got it worse. Bill Palmer, a liberal political analyst, tweeted that the Hawaii native should be "banned from baseball" for donning a red "Make America Great Again" hat that Palmer called "a form of racist hate speech and an implicit threat of violence."
Norman Ornstein, a political scientist at the conservative American Enterprise Institute who has denounced Trump, tweeted: "I love Kurt Suzuki as a player. But he wore a MAGA hat to the White House, so I will not cheer him."
For the Nationals, whose workaday spirit was epitomized by the motto "Stay in the fight," the week since they captured their first World Series title has demonstrated that while the players finished the fight on the field, they have stepped into a bigger battle in the political arena. The fallout over the politicized nature of the team's visit to the White House has become the latest flash point in the all-encompassing culture wars that have defined Trump's divisive presidency.
From pitcher Sean Doolittle's decision to speak out against Trump in boycotting the event to the supportive displays from Zimmerman and Suzuki, the Nationals have gone from a team that, in General Manager Mike Rizzo's words, "unified a region when the region needed unifying the most" to the latest convenient proxy for the nation's sharp divisions.
"All aspects of culture have been politicized," said Michael Kazin, a liberal historian at Georgetown University. Last year, Kazin warned in a New York Times op-ed that today's culture wars are born of the same fires that flared in the 1960s. He concluded that, even as he counseled his students to display empathy, "America will remain a society rent in two" until one side wins a definitive victory.
But Kazin is also a Nationals fan, and he has had difficulty heeding his own counsel. On Monday, he removed a Zimmerman bobblehead doll from his front doorstep. "I'm not proud of that," said Kazin, 71, who was arrested in 1968 for protesting Hubert Humphrey's nomination as the Democratic presidential candidate over his support for the Vietnam War. "We have to, as a society, separate what really matters in politics and what doesn't matter. This, in the end, really doesn't matter."
What the Nationals discovered, as so many have before them, is that there is no such thing as an apolitical event in the Trump era, when even once-routine photo ops have turned into referendums on the values of those who embrace Trump or reject him.
Doolittle's rejection of the president in the hours after the White House announced the visit Friday served as the first public notice that the team would not escape the political tempest that has engulfed other sports champions' dealings with Trump.
"I don't want to hang out with somebody who talks like that," Doolittle said of Trump, citing his rhetoric and his policies on immigration, housing and LGBT rights as reasons he would opt out.
Several of his teammates, including star Anthony Rendon and several other Latin American and African American players, also did not take part in the White House ceremony.
Doolittle was hailed as a hero among Trump's critics, but the president's supporters denounced him as being unpatriotic.
"I never liked Clinton, I never ever voted for him," tweeted Kristy Swanson, a movie actress and Trump supporter. "When I was invited to the @WhiteHouse in 1999 I proudly went, because I am a God loving American."
Aubrey Huff, a former player for several major league teams, also questioned Doolittle's decision. An outspoken Trump supporter, Huff reflected on his visits to the Obama White House after the San Francisco Giants won the World Series in 2010 and 2012.
"Did I vote for Obama? No. But I respected him as president and I wanted the country to do great," Huff said in an interview. Huff lamented that his conservative views have made him a pariah in San Francisco, a liberal bastion, and he defended Zimmerman and Suzuki on Twitter against the backlash from liberals, retweeting videos of them with Trump and calling Suzuki a "legend."
Huff said he accepted Suzuki's explanation that he was just trying to have "fun" and not make a political statement. "The biggest difference between the left and right is that the right likes to poke fun and make fun of the whole situation and not take things too seriously," Huff said. "The left gets worked up and angry and pissed off."

Trump reveled in the presence of the Nationals during the ceremony before a crowd of more than 5,000 on the South Lawn, after having been booed loudly by the home fans when he attended Game 5 of the World Series at Nationals Park. The president invited several of the players to speak, and he hugged Suzuki from behind after the catcher donned the MAGA hat.
The public backlash appeared to catch the players off guard. Suzuki locked his Twitter account from public view in the hours after the ceremony. Pitcher Stephen Strasburg labeled as "#FakeNews" a viral video clip that purported to show him ignoring Trump's effort to shake his hand.
The players' support delighted the president and his closest allies. Trump and his reelection campaign tweeted videos of the key moments, while Donald Trump Jr., who is promoting a new book titled "Triggered: How the Left Thrives on Hate and Wants to Silence Us," called Zimmerman's praise of Trump "awesome."
Andrew Pollack, a gun rights advocate, praised Suzuki on Twitter for "not caving into communist bullies & showing love for our president and country!"
Pollack, whose daughter Meadow was killed in the mass shooting at Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., last year, met with the president after the massacre and faced a backlash from liberals for offering support for Trump. "Ironic the party who claims 'love over hate' is at it again showing their hatred by chastising people who don't conform to their beliefs," Pollack tweeted after the outcry over the Nationals.
To Ornstein, however, Suzuki's exuberant display was an affront to the teammates who had opted out of the event over their concerns about a president who is "about to be impeached."
"What upset me," he said, "was turning it from a celebration of the team's victory into, for a couple of players, a celebration of Trump."

Texto completo: Two words have launched a thousand tweets and opened a new front in the generational wars.
Feeling completely clueless? OK, boomer.
The New York Times and NBC News last week picked up a trend from high-school halls and teens' TikTok accounts and deposited it in the national news. The Gen Z-generated phrase "OK, boomer" has turned into an epithet rallying the country's young against their forebears in collective mockery. The all-purpose reply is designed to disarm oldish people who dispense condescension dressed up as wisdom.
Your mom tells you that your peers' phones are rotting their brains, and that they should spend some time outside mowing the lawn. "OK, boomer." Your grandpa tells you that kids these days have lost all sense of civility because they yelled at Ellen DeGeneres for going to a football game with George W. Bush. "OK, boomer." Some random grump in your replies on Twitter tells you Greta Thunberg should go to school back in Sweden instead of gallivanting across the 50 states spreading the green gospel. "OK, boomer."
It's glib, it's short, and it's not at all sweet, but "OK, boomer" also reveals something about each of today's generations. So does the response the words have wrought.
The mainstreaming of a meme that was making its way onto $36 Redbubble-style sweatshirts sold by entrepreneurial 17-year-olds has, apparently, made boomers mad - which basically proves Gen Z's point. Conservative radio personality Bob Lonsberry took to the Web on Monday to not-so-patiently explain that "being hip and flip" does not excuse "bigotry," and that "boomer" is in fact "the n-word of ageism."
OK, boomer.
Then there's Gen X, dubbed by the media at various intervals as baby busters and 20-nothings. The names all imply a depressing sort of emptiness. So it's fitting that some in Gen Z seem to have forgotten that this in-between cohort exists at all and instead is lumping them in with the rest of the (relatively) elderly. Gen X is helping out by lumping themselves in with the boomers, and against those ungrateful kids.
Millennials have allied with Gen Z, and managed to vitiate the meme in the process by, basically, overdoing it. "OK, boomer" was fun and funny, so we said it about a million times on Twitter in the space of one day, and now it has become unfunny and lame. That's appropriate, too, for a generation that supposedly kills every good thing.
It makes sense that millennials are taking up arms with our Gen Z comrades - because we're the ones who have been maligned the most for the sin of our birth years. Gadgetry has stripped us of the capacity for meaningful human connection, or so the argument from self-help gurus, newspaper columnists and U.S. senators goes. The losers among us are basement-dwellers; the cool ones are profligates who refuse to contemplate the future. Blah, blah, avocado toast.
"OK, boomer" is appealing because, on the simplest level, it flips the script. Old people have been telling young people for years that they don't get it because they just haven't had the chance to learn. Now, young people have developed a cryptic code for telling old people that they're the ones who don't get it, and that failure is all the more flagrant because they have had countless chances to learn.
But the flipping is craftier than just that. What's important isn't that the kids are fighting back. It's that the kids are fighting back without really fighting at all. "OK, boomer" indicts not an argument and not an individual but an entire generation, or an entire generation's attitude - and it does it with two words dripping with dismissal. The Gen Z progenitors of this insolent slogan say they use it because they're inheriting a collapsing climate, an unequal economy and endless battles overseas that they didn't start. They're saying a lot with very little, and by saying very little they end up saying even more.
"OK, boomer" sends the message that the grown-ups have screwed up so totally, and are veering so speedily into irrelevance, that convincing them of anything is a waste of keyboard characters.

Texto completo: Headnote 2020 ELECTION
Trump trails Biden, leads Warren in new polls of Pa., key 2020 battleground states
Exactly a year out from Election Day, President Donald Trump is giving the Democratic contenders a run for their money in the six battleground states that helped put him in the White House in 2016, according to new New York Times/Siena polls released Monday.
The poll of registered voters in Pennsylvania shows Trump trailing former Vice President Joe Biden and U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., by 3% and 1% respectively, and even with U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. The results, however, are all within the poll's margin of error.
Across the six battleground states which include - in addition to Pennsylvania - Arizona, Florida, Michigan, North Carolina, and Wisconsin, Trump trails Biden by an average of 2% among registered voters, and leads Warren by the same margin, the Times reported on Monday.
Among Lkely Pennsylvania voters, Trump trails Biden by 1%, while leading Sanders by 1% and Warren by 2 percentage points, the new poll shows.
Altogether, the results suggest that, as was the case in 2016, the race is much tighter in key states than nationally, where Trump's approval ratings are at average of 43%, according to the RealClear Politics polling average.
"The Times/Siena results and other data suggest that the president's advantage in the Electoral College relative to the nation as a whole remains intact or has even grown since 2016, raising the possibility that the Republicans could - for the third time in the past six elections - win the presidency while losing the popular vote," the Times reported.
Trump defeated Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton by less than a percentage point in 2016, taking all 20 of the state's electoral votes and putting him on course to the White House.
While he has stumbled nationally, Biden was the top pick among Pennsylvania Democrats to face Trump in 2020, according to poll last week by Franklin & Marshall College in Lancaster. Biden took 30% support in the poll of 482 registered voters.
Warren and Sanders trailed at 18% and 12% respectively in the Franklin & Marshall canvass, which had a margin of error of 6.1%.
"While Mr. Biden ranks as the strongest Democrat in the swing states polled, the findings are not necessarily great news for him, either. His appeal to Democrats hinges on the view that he's a safe bet against the president, yet his lead against Mr. Trump is not nearly so comfortable that he could be considered a sure thing," the Times reported Monday.
John L. Micek is Editor-in-Chief of the Pennsylvania Capital-Star, where this story first appeared.

Barrington subdivision ‘nicest place’ in state

Texto completo: Barrington’s Fox Point subdivision is the nicest place in Illinois, according to a national publication that, as an example of the community’s generosity, cites a time when residents rushed to help neighbors whose belongings were placed on the front lawn during an eviction.
That and other instances of neighborly kindness helped land Fox Point on Reader’s Digest’s third annual 50 Nicest Places in America list. Columbiana, Ohio, wound up as the overall champion on the list, as decided by a nine-judge panel that included Reader’s Digest Editor in Chief Bruce Kelley and David Brooks, a New York Times columnist and the Aspen Institute’s executive director.
Built in the late 1960s, the 411-home Fox Point spans Cook and Lake counties and features a private lake, a pool, tennis courts and social activities. Bob Lee, a 40-year Fox Point resident, said the amenities bring residents together and allow them to get to know each other.
"You still are a neighborhood," Lee said. "You still see your neighbors."
Barrington village Trustee Mike Moran, who serves as the Fox Point Homeowners Association’s board president, said residents tend to be engaged there. Scores can be found walking in the mornings or on weekends on a road that loops around the lake, which lends itself to socialization.
"It’s a very family-run community," Moran said. "It’s nothing to have second and third generation move back into the neighborhood with their own kids after growing up in that neighborhood. It’s all about the family."
How Fox Point’s neighbors care for each other in times of need caught Reader’s Digest’s attention. One instance occurred in January 2018, when a couple in their 90s and their daughter were evicted from their house.
Fox Point resident Jack Keenan helped get the ball rolling after learning from his wife that furniture and other possessions filled much of the family’s front lawn on the 200 block of Surrey Lane when the eviction process began. At least 60 residents responded on a weekday to Keenan’s post on a neighborhood blog and filled a semitrailer with the items so the family could beat a deadline to be off the property or have whatever remained placed in a trash bin.
Reader’s Digest also noted how Fox Point residents displayed an outpouring of inclusiveness and support for a gay couple who in December 2018 reported to Barrington police that their rainbow pride flag was removed from a pole and replaced with a U.S. flag.
Neighbors brought meals to Casey Handel, Zadette Rosado and their two daughters. Many in Fox Point also placed miniature rainbow flags on their mailboxes.
Gov. J.B. Pritzker discussed the Fox Point response in his January inauguration address.
Reader’s Digest’s third annual, crowdsourced "nicest places" list is described as the publication’s response to an era of cultural and political divides. About 1,000 submissions were received about places across the country where people are kind and civility is winning.

Texto completo: DENVER - A man who repeatedly espoused anti-Semitic views has been arrested in a plot to bomb a historic Colorado synagogue, federal officials said Monday.
The co-conspirators in the plot turned out to be undercover agents, who arrested the man shortly before he planned to bomb the synagogue early Saturday, according to court documents.
Richard Holzer was arrested Friday in Pueblo just after the agents brought him what he believed were two pipe bombs along with 14 sticks of dynamite to blow up Temple Emanuel. The explosives were incapable of causing damage, authorities said.
Holzer, 27, described what he thought were explosives as "absolutely gorgeous" and said they should go ahead with the attack overnight to avoid police, the court document said.
Holzer, who lives in Pueblo, briefly appeared in court Monday in handcuffs. He told U.S. Magistrate Judge Kristen Mix that he understood the charge against him, and she scheduled his next court date for Thursday. She granted his request for a public defender.
The foiled plot is the latest attempted attack against a synagogue in the U.S. in just over a year.
In October 2018, a shooting at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh killed 11 people and became the deadliest attack on Jews in modern U.S. history.
According to the Anti-Defamation League, Holzer's arrest is the 13th time someone has been arrested on accusations of plotting attacks or making threats against the Jewish community since then.
Border Patrol agent shoots, kills gunman who opened fire
SUNLAND PARK, N.M. - A U.S. Border Patrol agent shot and killed a gunman who opened fire about a mile from the border with Mexico, immigration officials said.
The agent approached a group of four people early Monday, and one of them pulled out a gun and started shooting, according to a statement from U.S. Customs and Border Protection.
The agent fired back, hitting the man, who died at a hospital. No agents were hurt during the shooting in Sunland Park, a suburb of El Paso, Texas.
No additional information was released, including the names of the agent and gunman. The CBP's Office of Professional Responsibility is investigating the shooting.
New Mexico State police and FBI also are investigating, Albuquerque FBI spokesman Frank Fisher said.
DOJ sends letter to publisher of book by anonymous writer
NEW YORK - The Justice Department has sent a letter to the publisher and literary agency of the anonymous government official whose book is scheduled to come out Nov. 19. The letter raises questions over whether any confidentiality agreement has been violated and asked for information that could help reveal the author's identity.
The publisher, Hachette Book Group, responded by saying it would provide no additional information beyond calling the author a "current or former senior official."
The book, "A Warning," is by the official who wrote an essay published last year in The New York Times, alleging that numerous people in the government were resisting the "misguided impulses" of President Donald Trump.
Advice columnist sues Trump
for calling sex assault claim a lie
NEW YORK - An advice columnist for Elle magazine who has accused President Donald Trump of raping her in a New York City department store dressing room in the 1990s sued him Monday, saying he defamed her by calling her a liar whom he had never even met.
E. Jean Carroll's lawsuit, filed Monday in New York, says Trump "smeared her integrity, honesty and dignity - all in the national press" when he responded to her allegations, first broached in a New York magazine article this past June.
A message requesting comment was sent to a law firm that has represented Trump in other cases.
Carroll is among over a dozen women who have accused Trump of sexual misconduct or sexual assault, or both, predating his presidency.
Texan in school shooting said to be unfit for trial
HOUSTON - The trial for a teenager accused of fatally shooting 10 people at a Texas high school will be delayed while he receives mental health treatment, his attorney said Monday.
The news comes after three experts - one for the defense, one appointed by the court and one picked by prosecutors - found Dimitrios Pagourtzis incompetent to stand trial, said Nick Poehl, one of Pagourtzis' attorneys.
Kevin Petroff, the first assistant district attorney for Galveston County, said his office was working to meet with all families of the victims before making any statement.
Pagourtzis, 19, is charged with capital murder in the May 18, 2018, attack at Santa Fe High School, which is 50 miles southeast of Houston. His trial was set to start Feb. 18. Because he was 17 at the time of the attack, he is not eligible for the death penalty.
'King Perry' pleads guilty
in $115 million Ponzi scheme
SCRANTON, Pa. - The fraudster called himself "King Perry," and for a while he lived like royalty.
Perry Santillo masterminded an investment scam that collected more than $115 million from 1,000 investors around the country, using some of the proceeds to fund a lavish lifestyle of cars, casino junkets and houses in multiple states, according to federal securities regulators.
The Ponzi scheme collapsed, and Santillo, of Rochester, New York, is likely to trade his fancy duds for prison attire when he is sentenced on criminal conspiracy and fraud charges.
He appeared Monday in federal court to plead guilty to a federal fraud charge, having already entered a guilty plea last month to similar charges in Rochester. Each charge carries a maximum 20-year prison sentence.
In Oklahoma: A jury Monday found an Oklahoma City police officer guilty of second-degree murder in the shooting death of a suicidal man who was threatening to set himself on fire.
The jury deliberated 5 1/2 hours before finding Sgt. Keith Sweeney guilty in the Nov. 15, 2017, death of Dustin Pigeon, 29, and recommending a 10-year prison sentence. Second-degree murder is punishable by 10 years to life in prison.
Sweeney was among officers who found Pigeon doused in lighter fluid and threatening to set himself on fire in a courtyard. Prosecutors say Sweeney shot Pigeon after another officer fired a bean bag. An affidavit says Pigeon was unarmed and did not pose a threat when he was shot.
Caption: Thousands of Spaniards protest Monday in Madrid after five men accused of raping an unconscious 14-year-old girl in 2016 were sentenced to 10 to 12 years behind bars last week for sexual abuse instead of assault or rape. Protests were held in over 40 cities.

Donald Trump's second term is becoming more likely

Texto completo: The 2020 election could go one of two ways, both of which depend on the Democratic nominee. It will either be a contest between President Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden, or Trump will face Elizabeth Warren.

At least, that’s what a recent New York Times poll concludes, and there are plenty of other polls supporting it. This race has three top runners now — four if you include Bernie Sanders, though it seems more than likely that Warren will flatten or devour Sanders’s support base in the coming months.

The Times poll also makes an early prediction: If the candidate is Biden, Trump will lose. If the candidate is Warren, Trump will win.

It all comes down to the battleground states, many of which the president carried in 2016. The Times’s prediction — volatile and potentially worthless as it might be — makes a lot of sense when you look at why Trump won states such as Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Florida, Arizona, and North Carolina in the first place.

These voters weren’t Republican, but they weren’t committed Democrats either. Many of them were self-described moderate, blue-collar workers who had grown tired of depending on labor unions and were looking for economic reform. Take, for example, Michigan: Trump won about 500,000 union household votes in the automotive state, according to exit polls, and narrowly flipped the state. The situation was the same in Ohio. Hillary Clinton lost union households to Trump by 9 points, according to exit polls.

Biden has been doing all he can in recent months to win back the Rust Belt for the Democratic Party, introducing himself as “Middle-Class Joe” (despite the fact that no one besides Biden actually believes he’s middle class). But his attempt at familiarity could work for the same reason that it worked for former President Barack Obama.

Obama won union households in 2012 by 18%. In Michigan, Obama bested Mitt Romney in union households by 33%, and in Ohio, he won them by 23%. But Clinton never enjoyed that kind of advantage. At best, she had about a 13% advantage among union workers in Michigan, according to exit polls. Union workers ditched Hillary, but they did not suddenly become Republicans. Someone like Biden can still win them back.

Warren, on the other hand, faces the same problems Clinton did in 2016. The Times poll suggests voters question Warren’s “likeability” and have concerns about her ideology and gender. Her platform is too extreme for many likely voters, and unless she moderates her image, it’s likely Trump will carry the battleground states once again. In fact, the Times poll says likely voters chose Trump over Warren in every one of the six battleground states except for Arizona, where they were even.

Trump didn’t fare as well among likely voters when placed opposite Biden, who carried five of the six battleground states in the Times poll. But Trump’s advantage in the Electoral College remains the same and has even grown, according to the Times. The poll hints that even if Warren were to win the popular vote, Trump could still win the presidency.
The 2020 election is still more than a year away. If there’s one thing we should have learned from 2016, it’s not to count our chickens before they’ve hatched. But Warren’s campaign is gaining traction, and Biden’s is lagging behind. If recent and past polls are any indicator, a disenchanted blue-collar voter base, faced with a Warren candidacy, might just hand Trump a second term.

In historic shift, The Salt Lake Tribune gets IRS approval to become a nonprofit

Texto completo: The Salt Lake Tribune is now a nonprofit, an unprecedented transformation for a legacy U.S. daily that is intended to bolster its financial prospects during a troubling time for journalism nationwide.
The IRS approved the shift in a letter dated Oct. 29, deeming The Tribune a 501(c)(3) public charity. That means supporters can start making tax deductible donations now.
The move from a for-profit model was spurred by Tribune owner Paul Huntsman, who, in agreeing to turn Utah’s largest paper into a nonprofit, is giving up his sole ownership.
“The current business model for local newspapers is broken and beyond repair,” said Huntsman, who also serves as The Tribune’s publisher. “We needed to find a way to sustain this vital community institution well beyond my ownership, and nonprofit status will help us do that. This is truly excellent news for all Utah residents and for local news organizations across the country.”

The Tribune, a Pulitzer Prize-winning newspaper, will seek donations large and small, coupling them with revenue from advertising and subscriptions and a separate foundation. The Utah Journalism Foundation is creating an endowment to fund independent journalism in Utah, with The Tribune being a big beneficiary.
Those in the journalism industry have kept a close eye on The Tribune’s efforts, seeing it as a potential path forward for other struggling news outlets.
"This is an important decision that recognizes local news as a public good, something that strengthens the community," said Alberto Ibargüen, president of the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation, a nationwide leader in journalism philanthropy. "The model pioneered by The Salt Lake Tribune gives community leaders another way to build a sustainable future for local news, so citizens can get the trusted information they need to engage constructively in our democracy."
Other U.S. newspapers, such as The Philadelphia Inquirer and the Tampa Bay Times, draw support from nonprofits, and newspapers including The New York Times and Seattle Times benefit from foundations. No other legacy newspaper has made the full switch to nonprofit status.
Huntsman, who bought the paper in 2016, will transfer his ownership of The Tribune to a public board of directors, to be fleshed out in the months to come. Huntsman is the chairman of that board and has promised a strict “firewall” between its members and the newsroom, a move to protect The Tribune’s journalistic independence. He also has promised to reject contributions from people who want to direct or influence news coverage.

Jennifer Napier-Pearce will continue to serve as The Tribune’s editor. She says readers will likely notice little change to The Tribune’s journalism.
“We’ll still have [editorial cartoonist Pat] Bagley, we’ll still have sports analysis and we’ll still have all the hard-hitting investigative reporting Tribune readers have come to expect and rely on from The Tribune,” Napier-Pearce said. “The integrity of our reporting and our values as a news organization won’t change, but we will engage with the community in new ways and ask for their support.”
Some journalism observers wondered if the IRS would require The Tribune to jettison sports coverage or restaurant reviews to become a nonprofit, arguing that those stories might not fit under the educational mission spelled out in the tax law. That didn’t happen.
The IRS accepted The Tribune’s application without limitation. That means The Tribune will continue to provide its full breadth of coverage on politics, the arts, religion, environment, sports, opinion and more.
The Tribune will, however, stop any endorsements of political candidates going forward as required by the law governing nonprofits, but the editorial board, which is separate from the news staff, will continue to opine on the big issues of the day. The change has no bearing on columnists or cartoonist Bagley.
While all cash donations will be tax deductible, there will be no immediate changes to digital or print subscriptions, though it is possible that digital subscriptions will become tax deductible in the future. Print subscribers won’t see any changes to their billing or the delivery schedule, but their payment won’t be tax deductible because of business arrangements involving advertising, circulation, printing and delivery.
The IRS’ quicker-than-expected action means The Tribune will need a few weeks to expand its donation options, including offering monthly contribution plans.
“We were told by our lawyers that approval could take until the first quarter of 2020 or longer since this is a first-in-the-nation application,” said Fraser Nelson, Tribune vice president of business innovation. “Needless to say, we’re extremely grateful to the IRS for allowing this transition to move forward.”
All money donated to The Tribune will support the newsroom, Napier-Pearce said, which like just about every newspaper in the United States has seen staff cutbacks as advertising revenue has dried up or shifted to big online players like Google and Facebook. In 2011, The Tribune had a staff of 148, but through a series of layoffs, most recently in 2018, the staff now stands at about 60.
By relying on the support of readers and seeking new nonprofit partnerships, Napier-Pearce said, she hopes to expand The Tribune’s offerings in the months and years to come.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – The Department of Justice sent a letter to the publishers representing an anonymous Trump administration official who authored a tell-all book about Donald Trump's presidency, claiming the author may be violating "one or more nondisclosure agreements. "
The publisher and the author's agents are rejecting the argument and defended the official, calling the move an attempt to “intimidate" them.
The book, titled "A Warning," is set to be released on Nov. 19. The publisher said the person's identity will remain a secret and that the book picks up "where those first words of warning left off" after the explosive op-ed in The New York Times penned last year by the official.

"Our author knows that the President is determined to unmask whistleblowers who may be in his midst. That's one of the reasons A WARNING was written," literary agency Javelin said in a statement obtained by USA TODAY. "But we support the publisher in its resolve that the administration's effort to intimidate and expose the senior official who has seen misconduct at the highest levels will not prevent this book from moving forward. "
The letter from Associate Attorney General Joseph Hunt asks Carol Ross, the top lawyer for Hachette Book Group, and Javelin agents Matt Latimer and Keith Urbahn, to “immediately provide us with your representations that the author did not sign any nondisclosure agreement and that the author did not have access to any classified information in connection with government service. ”
Twelve, a division of Hachette Book Group, combated the DOJ's letter Monday, saying they are "not party to any nondisclosure agreements with the U. S. government that would require any pre-publication review of this book” and reiterated that they “made a commitment of confidentiality to Anonymous and we intend to honor that commitment. "
"Please be assured that Hachette takes its legal responsibilities seriously and, accordingly, Hachette respectfully declines to provide you with the information your letter seeks,” the publisher continued.

Trump publicly blasted the author at the time of the op-ed and accused the Times of fabricating it, tweeting "Does the so-called 'Senior Administration Official' really exist, or is it just the Failing New York Times with another phony source?"
The book comes as Trump is embroiled in an impeachment probe into his dealings with Ukraine, sparked by a whistleblower complaint, also from an anonymous person.

Missouri attorney general hasn't formally checked compliance with conflict-of-interest rules

Texto completo: JEFFERSON CITY -- Contrary to the office's ethics policy, the Missouri attorney general's office hasn't audited Attorney General Eric Schmitt's compliance with conflict-of-interest rules meant to combat the perception of "pay-to-play" politics within the agency.
The ethics policy states the attorney general will not accept campaign contributions from anyone under investigation by the agency, or from anyone with a pending bid for a state contract over which the attorney general's office has decision-making authority.
The policy also requires "regular internal audits" to ensure compliance, according to a copy of the policy obtained by the Post-Dispatch through an open-records request.
Former Attorney General Josh Hawley's predecessor, Democrat Chris Koster, had been dogged by a 2014 New York Times investigation showing his administration eased up on companies that had donated to his campaign.
"Few campaign contributions are more unseemly than when the target of a government investigation contributes to the official conducting the investigation," the policy, signed by Hawley, says. "These contributions give the appearance of outright bribery of law enforcement."
Hawley, a Republican, won election to the U.S. Senate last November, and Gov. Mike Parson appointed Schmitt as Hawley's replacement. Schmitt, a Republican, took office in January.
The Post-Dispatch requested a copy of the conflict-of-interest policy in October. After requesting and receiving the same information, Elad Gross, a Democrat running for attorney general, on Oct. 28 asked for copies of all "regular internal audits" conducted since the policy took effect.
Terry Brady, general counsel for the attorney general's office, wrote to Gross on Thursday that there were "no records responsive to your request."
The attorney general's office told the Post-Dispatch that internal audits are a major undertaking, and that the office "regularly reviews" its ethics policies.
"The office regularly reviews its policies, including the conflict of interest policy, to ensure they're serving their purpose," said Chris Nuelle, spokesman for Schmitt's office. "The AGO has a very strong conflict of interest policy, and we strive every day to be as ethical and professional as possible."
Schmitt's campaign requires donors to self-report whether they are under investigation.
Conflict-of-interest policies in the attorney general's office are notoriously difficult to enforce, according to former Koster officials.
Like Schmitt, Koster's policy also relied on donors to self-report whether they were under investigation. A Koster deputy said in 2015 it was unrealistic to expect a campaign to police the issue because only the attorney general's office knows what it is investigating.
Though both Schmitt's campaign and the attorney general's office prohibit contributions from entities under investigation, it is not clear whether a political action committee allied with Schmitt, the MO Opportunity PAC, follows the same rules.
The Post-Dispatch reported Saturday that Schmitt's campaign has received at least $150,000 from St. Louis developer Paul McKee's family members and entities tied to them over the course of Schmitt's 11-year political career.
Schmitt's office settled a tax credit fraud lawsuit in June with Paul McKee's NorthSide Regeneration for a fraction of what Hawley's administration had sought.
Schmitt has said he had no involvement in the tax-credit case, but his office said he did not recuse himself. It said such a recusal was unnecessary. The office did not say whether Schmitt approved the settlement.
In September, the political action committee backing Schmitt accepted a $10,000 contribution from a fund associated with Joseph McKee, a St. Louis developer who is the son of Paul McKee.

Texto completo: IndyStar's Butler basketball and Olympic sports reporter David Woods took first place in the annual U.S. Basketball Writers Association's Best Writing contest. Results were announced Wednesday.
Woods won for a story he wrote about Butler basketball player Sean McDermott, documenting McDermott's struggle to recover from a life-threatening staph infection even as his mother was diagnosed with cancer. Both recovered.
The story was published Nov. 8, 2018.
An excerpt From Woods' story:
The infection left him in what his mother described as a "newborn" state. Even on crutches, he could barely walk because he could not lift his feet. He shuffled. Climbing two steps was "torture," he said. He does not remember all the hospital visitors.
There was one thing his mother made sure the doctors did not say:
"Please don't tell him he can't play. Please don't ever say that."
He needed a goal. That goal was to resume playing basketball.
Woods is in good company: finishing second in the "Moderate length feature" category was Patrick Borzi of the New York Times; taking third place was John Feinstein of the Washington Post.
This is Woods' fifth honor from USBWA and his second first-place finish in the contest.
Also honored was former IndyStar reporter Terry Hutchens, who died after a car accident last year. He posthumously received the first Jim O'Connell Award for Excellence in Beat Reporting.

A war ends, a war begins

Texto completo: If China agreed to purchase $40 to $50 billion of U.S. farm goods in the next two years, as President Donald J. Trump announced Oct. 11, the futures market  where market reality is quickly sorted from political talk  literally wasnt buying it.
In fact, November soybean futures, the nearby contract, opened Oct. 14 at $9.405 per bushel and closed at $9.405, an almost unheard of result given that U.S. farmers are in the middle of their annual soybean season and the White House is in the middle of another monthly China tariff fight.
The December corn futures were even less impressed. Traders opened corn at $4.01 per bushel that day and finished the session nearly four cents per bushel lower. Prices then drained lower for the next two weeks.
And hogs? Every U.S. market player knows African Swine Flu continues to decimate the Chinese hog herd  some guesses put pig losses at a staggering 45 percent nationwide. So the presidents Oct. 11 announcement of substantial ag exports to China propelled December hog futures through the roof, right?
Not even close. Indeed, two weeks after the White Houses ag-exports talk, December hog futures were $5 per hundredweight, or more than 7 percent, lower than the day of the announcement.
Traders had a good reason for their cold reception to the presidents red-hot news. Most have been burned by fiery White House talk before so few were buying a pound of anything  witness soybean futures remarkably flat day  until they got confirmation.
Not only did it not come, news the next day proved the traders worries to be correct; China openly downplayed the White Houses giddy enthusiasm for any $50 billion ag deal and claimed no such agreement had been put to paper.
The markets overall sustained, lower reaction, however, is pointing to other, more ominous problems between China and the U.S. than just ag.
For example, the problem that started this trade war  the thorny, unresolved issue of Chinas required technology transfer by U.S. firms to do business there  is rarely mentioned by either side.
How can any U.S.-Chinese ag deal  an increased likelihood  stay above water with all that weight hanging around its neck? The market appears to be betting that it wont.
Another reason to worry is the sudden stern tone U.S. leaders have taken on China in speeches both there and in the U.S. The first to grumble was Terry Branstad, the former Iowa governor who now serves as U.S. ambassador to China.
On Oct. 21, Branstad publicly offered some unusually pointed remarks [that] turn on a catchphrase  reciprocity  that U.S. officials have invoked to justify a tougher approach toward China on issues including commerce and diplomacy, explained the Washington Post.
Branstad was speaking on behalf of the White House and proof came three days later when Vice President Mike Pence, reported The New York Times, denounced American companies that he said had compromised American values like free speech to appease the Chinese Communist Party.
China didnt take either slap lightly. A day after the Pence speech, a Chinese government spokeswoman said the vice presidents speech exuded sheer arrogance and hypocrisy, and was packed with political prejudice and lies
The American directness and the equally curt Chinese reply do not sound like two nations nearing agreement on anything. In fact, the unusually tough, undiplomatic talk sounds more like two nations preparing for a cold war rather than two nations preparing to end a trade war.
If thats the case  and who knows given this mercurial White House  then the futures traders bet soon will pay off yet again.

Texto completo: The opening night of the University of Southern Mississippi Symphony Orchestra will be a Russian extravaganza.
This is the symphony's centennial season and it opens 7:30 p.m Nov. 7 in Bennett Auditorium.
The symphony presents "From Russia With Love" — presented in part by Partners for the Arts.
The orchestra will perform iconic Russian works such as Tchaikovsky's "Romeo and Juliet Fantasy Overture" and Shostakovich's "Festive Overture."
Other pieces are Gliere's "Russian Sailors' Dance" and Rachmaninoff's "Rhapsody on a Theme by Paganini."
South African concert pianist Petronel Malan joins the orchestra for the Rachmaninoff work. She has been described by the New York Times as "formidable...dizzying...magical."
Malan has performed in major venues around the world such as Carnegie Hall in New York, Liszt Museum in Budapest, Théâtre du Châtelet and Salle Cortot in Paris and Alte Handelsbörse in Leipzig.
She has been nominated for three Grammy Awards, including "Best Instrumental Solo Album" for her debut disc "Transfigured Bach."
"I had the privilege to teach at Southern Miss some years ago," Malan said. "(The students')enthusiasm was inspiring and uplifting.
"I look forward to sharing the stage with these remarkable students performing one of my favorite piano works of all time."
Symphony director Michael Miles said opening night will be one of the most powerful concerts ever attempted by the symphony orchestra.
"Our audience will be emotionally challenged by the dramatic sounds and stories portrayed in these great symphonic works," he said.

Milken denies role in picking zone

Texto completo: Michael Milken is pushing back against a New York Times investigation that raised questions on whether the financier played a role in the selection of a thriving Nevada industrial park as an opportunity zone.
The Reno Gazette Journal reported on the Times' investigation on Tuesday. Milken sent a five-page statement to the Reno Gazette Journal after the story published denying any involvement in the decisions surrounding a controversial Storey County opportunity zone that includes the Tahoe Reno Industrial Center.
TRIC is a bustling industrial park that includes the Tesla Gigafactory, Switch Citadel, Google and the 67,000-acre Blockchains LLC property.
Milken is invested in a 688-acre property at the industrial park with developer Chip Bowlby of Reno Land.
Milken was especially critical of the New York Times article, which he called "a hit job" that could have a chilling effect on opportunity zone investment.
On the Mnuchin connection Opportunity zones are supposed to encourage development in economically challenged areas. The rules, however, also allow for a select number of tracts that are deemed non-low-income if their borders touch a low-income tract.
At the crux of the New York Times investigation is whether Milken directly lobbied longtime friend and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to change the rules in order to allow for the selection of the Storey County tract, which was previously deemed ineligible as an opportunity zone. At the time, the average income of the residents in the tract was considered too high.
Nevada ended up requesting the change to the eligibility requirements, however, following a phone call between then-Gov. Brian Sandoval and Mnuchin. The Storey County tract was then added at the expense of the town of Dayton in Lyon County, which was taken out of the list of 61 tracts nominated by the state.
Attempts by the Reno Gazette Journal to reach Sandoval for comment have been unsuccessful.
The New York Times investigation mentioned several meetings between Milken and Mnuchin prior to the change. Milken denied meeting with Mnuchin at the conference to discuss Storey County.
"We never met to discuss opportunity zones," Milken said.
Opportunity zone incentives Milken also pointed out that the 688-acre property in Storey County was purchased prior to the creation of the opportunity zone program because it was considered a "good, very long-term investment" due to the number of companies that were coming to the industrial park.
The increased activity at TRIC, however, is also one reason why many find it odd that it was selected to be part of an opportunity zone. With heavyweights like Tesla, Panasonic and Walmart in the industrial park, TRIC does not need any help attracting development. Instead, critics contend that the opportunity zone designation looks like a way to further enrich private interests.
Milken's partner Bowlby is a big proponent of opportunity zones and was one of the speakers at the Northern Nevada Opportunity Zone Summit earlier this year. Milken, however, says there are no plans to take advantage of opportunity zone incentives for the TRIC property.
"Are the owners of the 688 acres in the Tahoe Reno Industrial Park planning to use opportunity zone funds for the development of the property? No," Milken said. "(Bowlby and Reno Land have) no intention of using opportunity zone funds for the development of the property."
Bowlby did not respond to a request for comment from the Reno Gazette Journal.
Storey County in the news It is the second time that the Storey County opportunity zone has earned national coverage due to concerns about political gamesmanship in the selection process. In 2018, a Washington Post report also raised questions about Storey County's selection as an opportunity zone over the more economically challenged town of Dayton in Lyon County.
The Storey County opportunity zone designation fueled strong debate last year, including the roles of Sandoval and former Republican Congressman Dean Heller, as well as Treasury Secretary Mnuchin in the selection.
The return of Storey County to the national spotlight raises questions once again about opportunity zones and their potential for abuse, either during the selection process or as investment vehicles.
What is an opportunity zone? Opportunity zones were created as part of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2017. The law included a bipartisan provision that sought to encourage investment in low-income communities nationwide by providing tax incentives to those who invest in economically challenged areas.
Investors who invest in a qualified opportunity fund that invests in opportunity zone real estate projects are able to defer or delay paying taxes on their investment. This allows them to continue investing that money and further accelerate the growth of their investment, the same way that a 401(k) can realize faster gains by deferring taxes until the money is pulled out when a person retires.
Instead of retirement, however, opportunity zone investments work off a different timetable. Taxes from qualified opportunity funds can defer taxes either until Dec. 31, 2026 or when the asset is sold, with the tax rate changing depending on how long the investment is held. An investor who holds a qualified opportunity fund for five years prior to selling it, for example, can reduce the tax they pay on their deferred gains by 10%. Holding the investment for more than seven years increases the discount to 15%.
Hold the investment for a decade or more and the investor gets an even bigger incentive.

Our history in 27 buildings

Texto completo: The only constant in New York is change, as Sam Roberts makes clear in the lively thumbnail histories he attaches to more than two dozen exemplary structures in his book "A History of New York in 27 Buildings" (though three are not actually buildings).
The 18th century Federal Hall in which George Washington took the first presidential oath was razed and replaced by a custom house, which was later turned into a branch of the Treasury, then housed government agencies ranging from the Interstate Commerce Commission to the Coast Guard before being declared a national historic site. The Domino sugar refinery was revamped as office and apartment spaces, after briefly displaying an 80-foot-long sugar sculpture by Kara Walker. A.T. Stewart's glamorous Marble Palace, model for every department store that followed, was converted into a warehouse, then headquartered a newspaper, then municipal offices. Pier A once jutted into a harbor clogged with freighters and ocean liners, deteriorated for decades while commercial shipping declined, and is now topped by a fancy restaurant suitable for a waterfront devoted to leisure and recreation.
Even buildings that continue to fulfill their original function have seen change, Roberts reminds us. The Apollo Theater, built as a burlesque house in 1914, became a showcase for African-American performers as Harlem became the most famous black neighborhood in America; today, the theater continues to celebrate African-American artists and host its famous weekly Amateur Night while the area around it sees an influx of gentrifying white residents. No longer do 100 long-distance trains depart each day from Grand Central Station now that transcontinental travel is largely by plane, but its majestic public spaces continue to welcome a daily influx of  several hundred thousand commuters-a term that was coined, Roberts notes, "after the New York Central popularized the practice of commuting the cost of single rides for  monthly passengers."
Those sorts of fun facts abound in "A History of New York in 27 Buildings." (A personal favorite: the brownstone at 123 Lexington Ave. where Chester A. Arthur was sworn in as president in 1881 is now the enormous Indian spice and grocery store Kalustyan's.) Yet the book's casual, anecdotal tone masks considerable intellectual rigor. Emulating the approach he took in "A History of New York in 101 Objects," the author chose monuments he deemed "emblematic of a transformational economic, social, political, or cultural event or era." This broad mandate allows Roberts, former urban affairs correspondent for The New York Times and host of the podcast "Only in New York," to consider everything from the city's water-supply infrastructure (the High Bridge on the Harlem River) and subway system (the Stanford White-designed Powerhouse) to the ever-vexed relation of the other boroughs to Manhattan (Brooklyn's Bossert Hotel).
Roberts chronicles the histories of his chosen monuments in loosely chronological order. He begins with the 17th century Bowne House, whose owner permitted Quakers to worship there in an early demonstration of the city's tradition of religious tolerance. He ends with 60 Hudson Street, Western Union's 1930 flagship building, where pneumatic tubes "are now packed with bundled copper wire and fiber optic and coaxial cables" to serve the new digital economy. Public housing, the banking industry, Broadway, and the art market are among the other aspects of New York life he characterizes through individual edifices, each one thoughtfully chosen and vividly depicted.
The book is necessarily highly selective and also includes the Flatiron Building, the Lyceum Theatre, City Hall, among others. Still, it seems odd not to have anything constructed after 1936. (Hunter College Gymnasium in the Bronx, makeshift site of the first session of the United Nations Security Council in 1946, was built after 60 Hudson Street, but Roberts covers it three chapters earlier.) Surely the Brooklyn Heights Promenade, an exemplary urban pushback against the post-World War II mania for highway building, deserves a spot as a monument to New Yorkers' love of walking. Also, given the current ferocious debate over whether it should be closed while the Brooklyn Queens Expressway it was built to cover is repaired, the Promenade demonstrates the complex issues raised by each shift in the city's ever-evolving landscape. One of the recent super-skinny high-rises designed for super-rich foreign tenants could serve as a painful object lesson in New York's inability to deal with its affordable housing crisis.
Each reader is likely to think of a meaningful structure that should have been included, and that's just what Roberts wants. His declared goal is "to stimulate debate"; he invites readers to submit their own lists. Meanwhile, his own list provides much food for thought and an enjoyable portrait of New York as embodied in 27 key landmarks of its built environment.

Texto completo: The flowers in the yard have gone by. No more dahlias, tithonia, gladioli or other blossoms to cut and bring inside to brighten up the house.
But the garden still has lots of items that anyone can bring inside to add color and texture to the indoor environment.
One example is seed heads. I've written previously that my wife Nancy and I no longer cut back all of our perennials in the fall, letting the ones that don't flop to the ground stay and spread their seed, thus creating a more natural garden.
But bringing some of that seed inside will not deprive the yard of that many plants.
Rudbeckia, echinacea, many alliums, veronicastrum or Culver's root and most grasses have striking stems with seeds. Some, such as echinacea or purple coneflower, still have some color while others have gone brown.
Sitting in a vase in our living room as I type this are seven dried stems of Actaea (formerly cimicifuga) racemosa, ranging from two to five feet long, and the look is spare and architectural.
The results can even be prize-winning. Steven Edney, a professional gardener and host of a radio gardening show in Kent, England, won an award at the Chelsea Flower Show this spring using seed heads saved from the previous year, according to an Oct 11 article in the New York Times Style Magazine. (Don't think I stole the idea for this column from the Times. I told my editor Oct. 5 about my plan to write on this topic.)
Some of our favorite plant-based Christmas decorations are seed heads of unusual alliums, especially Schubertii, that we have spray-painted silver. They are about a foot in diameter and look like an early space satellite. The spray paint makes them - and many other dried flowers - stand out, but they are attractive without the paint as well.
One of the best late-season flowers to bring inside is hydrangea. All of the cultivars work. These blossoms will stay on the shrub all winter, and can be cut and brought inside at any stage of their development.
A popular way to use the plant is to make a hydrangea wreath. To create these the blossoms must be dried, a process that can be done in several ways. Nancy prefers to put the stems in a vase with about a half-inch of water. She splits the stems, removes all the foliage and just leaves the blossoms alone after the water disappears - all that time they provide a spot of color while they are drying. Alternatively, you can tie several blossoms together and hang them in a cool, dry place.
There are several methods to make the wreath, as well. The flowers can be attached to a grapevine wreath with floral wire (a highly pliable wire, often green) or with a hot-melt glue gun. Or you can use a metal wreath form and attach the hydrangea with floral wire. They look stunning but must be displayed indoors or in a well-protected porch because rain will ruin them.
Fall is foliage season and it makes sense to bring some leaves inside for decoration. Display them in a dish or flat bowl or maybe cut off a small branch and put it in a vase. Large red or yellow maple leaves are especially attractive.
Don't forget branches. A piece of wood may look good for all sorts of reasons - because it twists attractively, serves as host to mushrooms or has an interesting color or texture. Birch and red-twig dogwoods always look good.
Don't be afraid to experiment. Walk around your yard - always an enjoyable task. If you see something that attracts your eye, bring it inside and see what you can do with it. Just be sure to check thoroughly for any insects first.

Texto completo: A word to the youngs: The shiny tools of modernity will always fall prey to the ancient flaws of humanity.
"OK Boomer."
I hear that dryly dismissive phrase leveled at me quite a bit lately from Shawn McCreesh, the 27-year-old in my office.
It's gotten so bad that I've stopped bothering to ask him to decode the mysteries of millennial behavior and taste, much less to decipher what makes the younger TikTok generation tick.
The Times Style section calls the phrase a declaration of intergenerational war.
"'OK Boomer' has become Generation Z's endlessly repeated retort to the problem of older people who just don't get it, a rallying cry for millions of fed up kids," Taylor Lorenz wrote. It's quickly been adopted by millennials as well.
Shawn OK-Boomered me Friday on the topic of Katie Hill, the 32-year-old freshman California congresswoman who is openly bisexual and ran what Vice dubbed "the most millennial campaign ever." Her promising career flamed out in a scandal that was both age-old and very millennial, in that it featured revenge porn, a throuple, sexual fluidity and dirty bong water.
Hill was a blast of fresh air on the Hill. And it is amazing that, after two centuries of men treating the political landscape here as a droit du seigneur playground, that the one ensnared in an ethics investigation about the new rules enacted last year on sexual harassment -- barring lawmakers from having sexual relationships with staffers -- is a woman.
Hill pointed the finger at her "abusive" loser husband, Kenny Heslep, who has been unemployed for the past five years, implying that he leaked the pictures and texts to Hill's foes. Not since Linda Tripp has there been such a creepy betrayal in politics.
It turned out that one of the people responsible for publishing Hill's photos and texts is a Republican operative who worked for her opponents.
As The L.A. Times reported, Heslep wrote in divorce papers that Hill came home from Washington and said she was leaving. "She took our only operable vehicle and left me stranded at our residence," he wrote, adding that his parents had to lend him money to hire a divorce lawyer.
In her fiery exit speech, Hill gave her side: "The forces of revenge by a bitter jealous man, cyber exploitation and sexual shaming that target our gender and a large segment of society that fears and hates powerful women have combined to push a young woman out of power and say that she doesn't belong here."
She continued, "Yet a man who brags about his sexual predation, who has had dozens of women come forward to accuse him of sexual assault, who pushes policies that are uniquely harmful to women and who has filled the courts with judges who proudly rule to deprive women of the most fundamental right to control their own bodies, sits in the highest office in the land."
Hill's parting vote on Thursday was to endorse the impeachment inquiry.
Shawn and I both felt sad watching her implode. But, while I agree with Hill that there are double standards and that we still dwell in a misogynistic culture, I also think she should have realized that we're operating under new rules now and that they apply to both sexes.
I reiterated to Shawn my bewilderment that every millennial moment -- even the most private -- can be enjoyed only if it's documented and uploaded God knows where.
While he agreed that it was reckless for Hill to be in those sort of pictures once she had entered the political arena, he said that I was missing the forest for the trees: Youngs who can't even imagine that they will one day run for office may already have racy shots somewhere out there.
He pointed to a viral text going around this past month as evidence that most young people have at least one picture on their phones that they don't want to get out. The first line of the text refers to Instagram and pops up on the recipient's phone with the most horrifying words known to the millennial mind: "Why is there a nude on your story??" Once the text is opened, it turns out to be a prank. Nonetheless, Shawn said, it caused a lot of spilled coffees and near car crashes among his friends.
He said that iPhones and social media have so reshaped culture that older people would have to accept the new and sometimes naked reality. He had to agree with Representative Matt Gaetz, the 37-year-old Florida Republican and Trump lap dog, who told Fox News: "This is an issue where a lot of millennials, I think, sympathize with Katie Hill because a lot of young people who grew up with a smartphone in their hands took pictures, sent them, shared messages and materials that are now recoverable later in life."
I get that young people are digital natives, even cyborgs. But I had to offer a riposte to Shawn that, while society can be reshaped, human nature is immutable. What I learned from studying Shakespeare is that the primary colors of emotions carry through the centuries.
There will always be vengeful exes and envious allies and ruthless opponents and double-crossing friends. Whether the messages are being carried by pigeons or pixels, you have to protect yourself -- and your data. Don't let our shiny new tools blind you to the fact that some horrible truths about humanity never change.
And don't leave yourself vulnerable by giving people the ammunition -- or the nudes -- to strip you of your dreams.
OK, millennials?

Texto completo: Forget Scandinavia. Switzerland is richer and yet has a surprisingly equal wealth distribution.
Like many progressive intellectuals, Bernie Sanders traces his vision of economic paradise not to socialist dictatorships like Venezuela but to their distant cousins in Scandinavia, which are just as wealthy and democratic as the United States but have more equitable distributions of wealth, as well as affordable health care and free college for all.
There is, however, a country far richer and just as fair as any in the Scandinavian trio of Sweden, Denmark and Norway. But no one talks about it.
This $ 700 billion European economy is among the world's 20 largest, significantly bigger than any in Scandinavia. It delivers welfare benefits as comprehensive as Scandinavia's but with lighter taxes, smaller government, and a more open and stable economy. Steady growth recently made it the second richest nation in the world, after Luxembourg, with an average income of $ 84,000, or $ 20,000 more than the Scandinavian average. Money is not the final measure of success, but surveys also rank this nation as one of the world's 10 happiest.
This less socialist but more successful utopia is Switzerland.
While widening its income lead over Scandinavia in recent decades, Switzerland has been catching up on measures of equality. Wealth and income are distributed across the populace almost as equally as in Scandinavia, with the middle class holding about 70 percent of the nation's assets. The big difference: The typical Swiss family has a net worth around $ 540,000, twice its Scandinavian peer.
Switzerland did draw 15 minutes of media attention around 2010, when Obamacare was still new -- but only for its health care system, which requires all residents to buy insurance from private providers and subsidizes those who can least afford it. Admirers said Swiss health care had something for everyone: universal coverage for liberals, private providers and consumer choice for conservatives.
But for the most part, intellectuals ignore Switzerland as a model, perhaps put off by its exaggerated reputation as a shady little tax haven, where Nazi gold and other illicit fortunes hide behind strict bank secrecy laws. In 2015, Switzerland agreed under pressure to share bank records with foreign tax authorities, but that has not slowed the economy at all. Switzerland always was more than secretive banks.
Capitalist to its core, Switzerland imposes lighter taxes on individuals, consumers and corporations than the Scandinavian countries do. In 2018 its top income tax rate was the lowest in Western Europe at 36 percent, well below the Scandinavian average of 52 percent. Government spending amounts to a third of gross domestic product, compared with half in Scandinavia. And Switzerland is more open to trade, with a share of global exports around double that of any Scandinavian economy.
Streamlined government and open borders have helped make this landlocked, mountainous country an unlikely incubator of globally competitive companies. To build wealth, a country needs to make rich things, and an M.I.T. ranking of nations by the complexity of the products they export places Switzerland second behind Japan, well ahead of the Scandinavian countries, whose average rank is 15.
The Swiss excel in just about every major industry other than oil, often by targeting specialized niches, such as biotech and engineering. The country is home to 13 of the top 100 European companies, more than twice as many as in the three Scandinavian nations combined. And most top Swiss firms dwarf Scandinavian peers. Nestlé, with a stock market value of $ 320 billion, is 15 times larger than its closest Scandinavian rival.
Though major multinationals are concentrated in big cities, the Swiss economy is as decentralized as its political system. Traveling southwest from Zurich to Geneva recently, I was struck by how many iconic Swiss exports also originate in its provinces -- Swiss Army knives from Schwyz, watches from Bern, St. Bernard puppies from a mountain pass in Valais, cheese and chocolates from Fribourg. Small companies anchor the economy, accounting for two of every three jobs. Only one in seven Swiss work for the government, about half the Scandinavian average.
No other nation's currency has been rising faster against its trading partners, and normally a rising franc should erode Swiss exports by making them more expensive. Instead, while most rich countries (including Scandinavia's) saw their share of global exports fall over the past decade, Switzerland's continued to rise. Such is the reputation of its engineers and chocolatiers that customers readily pay more for Swiss goods.
The premium the world is willing to pay for Swiss goods and services helps deter capital flight and stabilize the economy. Switzerland has not been hit by a domestic financial crisis since the 1970s; the Scandinavian countries were wracked by crises in the 1990s and suffered sharper downturns than Switzerland did following the global crisis of 2008.
If there is any fault line, it is that in trying to slow the rise of the franc, Switzerland cut interest rates to record lows ahead of its European peers, triggering a lending boom that has driven private corporate and household debt up to 250 percent of G.D.P., a risky height. No paradise is perfect.
For all its local charms, Switzerland is worldly in the extreme. The Swiss are a polyglot mix of German, French and Italian speakers, many intimidatingly fluent in multiple languages. The foreign-born population has been increasing for more than a century and accounts for a quarter of the whole, 40 percent non-European Union.
True, the rise of anti-immigrant parties across Europe has an offshoot in Switzerland. The country has always been choosy, accepting new arrivals based on their professional résumé more than family ties or humanitarian need. But Australia and Canada also filter immigrants to fill jobs and are widely studied models of how rich economies can survive the aging of their domestic work forces.
Switzerland has been welcoming more immigrants than any Scandinavian country since the 1950s. It is on track to accept more than 250,000 immigrants between 2015 and 2020, expanding its population by 3 percent. That immigration rate is nearly double the Scandinavian average, and one of the highest among large, developed countries. Immigrants are also significantly more likely to hold jobs in Switzerland, in part because most are required to land one before they arrive.
The Swiss labor force gets an added boost from a meritocratic public school system that starts steering students as young as 12 toward their academic strengths. The world-class universities charge average annual tuition of only $ 1,000 and leave graduates thousands of dollars less in debt than many Scandinavian schools.
Die-hard admirers of Scandinavian socialism overlook the change of heart in countries such as Sweden, where heavy government spending led to the financial crises of the 1990s. Sweden responded by cutting the top income tax rate from nearly 90 percent to as low as 50 percent. Public spending fell from near 70 percent of G.D.P. to 50 percent. Growth revived, as the largest Scandinavian economy started to look more like Switzerland, streamlining government and leaving business more room to grow.
The real lesson of Swiss success is that the stark choice offered by many politicians -- between private enterprise and social welfare -- is a false one. A pragmatic country can have a business-friendly environment alongside social equality, if it gets the balance right. The Swiss have become the world's richest nation by getting it right, and their model is hiding in plain sight.

Texto completo: With "nunchi," all you need is your eyes, your ears and a quiet mind.
I was born in the United States and raised in an English-speaking household. My parents spoke Korean with each other -- it was great for secret conversations -- but not with me and my siblings. Nonetheless, some Korean words were impossible to escape.
One of the first I learned was "nunchi"-- literally translated, "eye-measure." Nunchi is the art of sensing what people are thinking and feeling, and responding appropriately. It's speed-reading a room with the emphasis on the collective, not on specific individuals. It might be the most important word I ever learned.
As with most Korean children, I learned it in the negative, with my parents chiding, "Why don't you have any nunchi?" In traditional Korean child rearing, nunchi is on a par with "Look both ways before crossing the street" and "Don't hit your sister."
In Korea, nunchi is woven into everyday life. Take, for example, business cards. Even in the era of LinkedIn, Koreans still exchange business cards, and the exchange approaches ceremonial levels: You must take and receive a business card with both hands, as if it were fragile, and study it respectfully for a few seconds. You never stuff it in your wallet. This ritual gives all parties a chance to take a beat and use their nunchi -- to eye-measure each other to get a sense of the implied hierarchy and whether one is reckoning with a future ally or a foe. It also connects the giver with the receiver, laying a foundation for trust.
There is a Korean expression, "Half of social life is nunchi." You need nunchi to get along with people, to get what you want out of people in a purely pragmatic sense and to protect yourself from danger. Nunchi emphasizes speed -- if you are a skilled nunchi practitioner, Koreans don't say you have "good" nunchi, they say you have "quick" nunchi.
Whereas the average person enters a room focusing only on a few people (the ones they like or hate or want to sleep with), a skilled nunchi practitioner takes a mental snapshot of the whole room. Is the atmosphere light or heavy? Why? Is a soccer game on TV in the 89th minute? Did someone's ex just walk in?
Maybe you have nunchi already: Do you sense when a host secretly wants you to leave? Do you accurately sense when dangers are real before your friends do? Then you probably have quick nunchi. When a work meeting is about to end, do you jump in with, "I just have one more question"? Do people roll their eyes when you speak? Then you need to work on your nunchi.
The great thing about nunchi is you don't need to be rich, privileged, or even in a good mood to employ it. In fact, Koreans say that nunchi is "the secret weapon of the disadvantaged." It's especially useful to women and minorities in the workplace who, like me, are tired of being given contradictory feedback -- that they are either leaning out or leaning in too much.
Nunchi exists so that the embattled can focus on changing the circumstances within their control. You don't need to be the loudest in order to present your ideas or ask for a raise; you just need to have the best timing.
Nunchi is also helpful for those who suffer social anxiety, like me. Anxiety often comes from fear of judgment, and there's no better antidote than focusing on the room as if you were raptly watching a play.
The English language has terms that are vaguely related to nunchi, like empathy and emotional intelligence. But the road to hell is paved with empathy. In the West, for some reason, empathy holds a kingly position among the virtues. Empathy might be what sets you apart from sociopaths, but it cannot protect you from sociopaths.
Excessive empathy can be dangerous. Narcissists are known for targeting empathetic people. It's great to put yourself in another's shoes, but the logical extension may be that you lose yourself. It's destabilizing. Nunchi, by contrast, puts quiet observation first, which allows you to stay on firm ground while still listening to the other person.
What's more, concepts like empathy and emotional intelligence are ill adapted to the 21st century: They are no contest for the hermitry that technology allows us to indulge in, or for the expectation of instantaneous responses from others.
Nunchi, despite being as old as Korean civilization itself, is extraordinarily suited for modern life because it requires speed and adaptability. All you need are your eyes and your ears. And -- this is the hard part -- a quiet mind.
You might well wonder, if nunchi is so great, why isn't the world doing it already? Well, aspects of nunchi are horrifying to the 21st-century Western mind, the opposite of what we teach our children. Nunchi requires that you admit the value of collectivism, of introversion, and above all, of never passing up a good opportunity to shut up.
I am living evidence that nunchi works. When I was 12, my parents decided to move back to their homeland, South Korea. Despite knowing no Korean, I was placed in a Korean school. I had no lever to pull except to watch what the other children were doing.
A Korean education is a nunchi education: In my day, students were not allowed to ask questions during class. Teachers gave students intentionally vague information about everything from what school supplies to bring to where exams were taking place. Working out these mysteries on your own by using your nunchi was part of your education.
Within a year, I was at the top of my class. Within 18 months, I was class vice president. All this despite the fact that my Korean was still pretty bad. My success was all down to my forcibly honed nunchi.

Texto completo: Intelligent machines catastrophically misinterpreting human desires is a frequent trope in science fiction, perhaps used most memorably in Isaac Asimov’s stories of robots that misconstrue the famous “three laws of robotics.” The idea of artificial intelligence going awry resonates with human fears about technology. But current discussions of superhuman A.I. are plagued by flawed intuitions about the nature of intelligence.
We don’t need to go back all the way to Isaac Asimov — there are plenty of recent examples of this kind of fear. Take an Op-Ed in The New York Times and a new book, “Human Compatible,” by the computer scientist Stuart Russell. Russell believes that if we’re not careful in how we design artificial intelligence, we risk creating “superintelligent” machines whose objectives are not adequately aligned with our own.
As one example of a misaligned objective, Russell asks, “What if a superintelligent climate control system, given the job of restoring carbon dioxide concentrations to preindustrial levels, believes the solution is to reduce the human population to zero?” He claims that “if we insert the wrong objective into the machine and it is more intelligent than us, we lose.”
Russell’s view expands on arguments of the philosopher Nick Bostrom, who defined A.I. superintelligence as “an intellect that is much smarter than the best human brains in practically every field, including scientific creativity, general wisdom and social skills.” Unlike today’s best machines, which remain far below the level of humans in all but relatively narrow domains (such as playing chess or Go), Bostrom and Russell envision a superintelligence with vast general abilities.
Bostrom, Russell and other writers argue that even if there is just a small probability that such superintelligent machines will emerge in the foreseeable future, it would be an event of such magnitude and potential danger that we should start preparing for it now. In Bostrom’s view, “a plausible default outcome of the creation of machine superintelligence is existential catastrophe.” That is, humans would be toast.
These thinkers — let’s call them the “superintelligentsia” — speculate that if machines were to attain general human intelligence, the machines would quickly become superintelligent. They speculate that a computer with general intelligence would be able to speedily read all existing books and documents, absorbing the totality of human knowledge. Likewise, the machine would be able to use its logical abilities to make discoveries that increase its cognitive power.
Such a machine, the speculation goes, would not be bounded by bothersome human limitations, such as slowness of thought, emotions, irrational biases and need for sleep. Instead, the machine would possess something like a “pure” intelligence without any of the cognitive shortcomings that limit humans.
The assumption seems to be that this A.I. could surpass the generality and flexibility of human intelligence while seamlessly retaining the speed, precision and programmability of a computer. This imagined machine would be far smarter than any human, far better at “general wisdom and social skills,” but at the same time it would preserve unfettered access to all of its mechanical capabilities. And as Russell’s example shows, it would lack humanlike common sense.
The problem with such forecasts is that they underestimate the complexity of general, human-level intelligence. Human intelligence is a strongly integrated system, one whose many attributes — including emotions, desires, and a strong sense of selfhood and autonomy — can’t easily be separated.
Similarly, if generally intelligent A.I. is ever created (something that will take many decades, if not centuries), its objectives, like ours, will not be easily “inserted” or “aligned.” They will rather develop along with the other qualities that form its intelligence, as a result of being embedded in human society and culture. The machines’ push to achieve its objectives will be tempered by the common sense, values and social judgment without which general intelligence cannot exist.
What’s more, the notion of superintelligence without humanlike limitations may be a myth. It seems likely to me that many of the supposed deficiencies of human cognition are inseparable aspects of our general intelligence, which evolved in large part to allow us to function as a social group. It’s possible that the emotions, “irrational” biases and other qualities sometimes considered cognitive shortcomings are what enable us to be generally intelligent social beings rather than narrow savants. I can’t prove it, but I believe that general intelligence can’t be isolated from all these apparent shortcomings, either in humans or in machines that operate in our human world.
In his 1979 Pulitzer Prize-winning book, “Gödel, Escher, Bach: an Eternal Golden Braid ,” the cognitive scientist Douglas Hofstadter beautifully captured the counterintuitive complexity of intelligence by posing a deceptively simple question: “Will a thinking computer be able to add fast?” Dr. Hofstadter’s surprising but insightful answer was, “perhaps not.”
As Hofstadter explained: “We ourselves are composed of hardware which does fancy calculations but that doesn’t mean that our symbol level, where ‘we’ are, knows how to carry out the same fancy calculations. Let me put it this way: there’s no way that you can load numbers into your own neurons to add up your grocery bill. Luckily for you, your symbol level (i.e., you ) can’t gain access to the neurons which are doing your thinking — otherwise you’d get addle-brained … Why should it not be the same for an intelligent program?”
In other words, the intelligent part of your mind can’t harness the fast-adding skills of your own neurons, and for good reason. This barrier — between the “self” that you are aware of and the detailed activity of your brain — permits the kind of thinking that matters for survival without getting overwhelmed (“addle-brained”) by your own thought processes. Similarly, a thinking computer’s hardware, like ours, would presumably include circuits for fast arithmetic, but at the level of its cognitive awareness, the machine wouldn’t be able to access these circuits any more than we humans can.
It’s fine to speculate about aligning an imagined superintelligent — yet strangely mechanical — A.I. with human objectives. But without more insight into the complex nature of intelligence, such speculations will remain in the realm of science fiction and cannot serve as a basis for A.I policy in the real world.
Understanding our own thinking is a hard problem for our plain old intelligent minds. But I’m hopeful that we, and our future thinking computers, will eventually achieve such understanding in spite of — or perhaps thanks to — our shared lack of superintelligence.

Paul Krugman: Did Warren pass the Medicare for All test? Yes.

Texto completo: Last week I worried that Elizabeth Warren had painted herself into a corner by endorsing the Sanders “Medicare for All” plan. It was becoming obvious that she couldn’t stay vague about the details, especially how to pay for it; and some studies, even by center-left think tanks, suggested that any plan along these lines would require large tax hikes on the middle class. So what would she come up with?
Well, the Warren plan is now out. And I’d say that she passed the test. Experts will argue for months whether she’s being too optimistic — whether her cost estimates are too low and her revenue estimates too high, whether we can really do this without middle-class tax hikes. You might say that time will tell, but it probably won’t: Even if Warren becomes president, and Dems take the Senate too, it’s very unlikely that Medicare for All will happen any time soon.
Nonetheless, Warren needed to show that she was working the problem. And she did. She brought in real experts like Donald Berwick, who ran Medicare during the Obama years, and Betsey Stevenson, former chief economist at the Labor Department. And they have produced a serious plan. As I said, experts will argue with the numbers, but this is the real thing — not some left-leaning version of voodoo economics.
How does the Warren plan expand Medicare to cover everyone without raising taxes on the middle class? There are four main components.
First, the Warren team argues that a single-payer system would provide significant savings in overall medical costs — more than other studies are assuming. Some of these would come from bargaining down prices, especially on drugs. Others would come from a reduction in administrative costs.
Are these savings plausible? Well, America does pay incredibly high prices for drugs compared with other countries, and the complexity of our system imposes a huge administrative burden — not just the overhead of insurance companies, but the sheer number of people doctors and hospitals have to employ to deal with multiple insurers. I’ve been puzzled at the reluctance of other studies to credit Medicare for All with big savings on these fronts.
And we should note that even with these assumed cost savings, U.S. health spending per capita would remain far above that of other advanced countries. So there’s a case — not an open-and-shut case, but a reasonable one — for optimism here.
Second — and the cleverest item in the plan — the Warren team would basically require employers who are now offering health insurance to their employees to pay the cost of that insurance to the government instead. Bear in mind that large employers are already required by law (specifically, the Affordable Care Act) to provide insurance. So this would just redirect those funds.
Third, state and local governments currently spend a lot on health care, mainly but not only through their share of Medicaid spending. The Warren plan would require “maintenance of effort,” basically requiring that states continue to spend that money, but on supporting a national plan.
Finally, even with all this there’s a significant budget hole. Warren’s team argues that this can be closed in two ways: some further taxes on corporations and large fortunes, and — an important point — strengthening the IRS, which we know fails to collect large amounts of legally owed taxes, principally from people with high incomes, because Republicans have starved the agency of resources.
Am I enthusiastically endorsing this plan? No. I still think that a public-option-type plan, which lets people buy into Medicare, would have a better chance of actually becoming reality — and may well be where a President Warren actually ends up if she gets to the White House. And the plan’s optimism on costs and revenues could be wrong.
But this is a serious plan that reflects hard thinking. In particular, it’s nothing like the snake oil that passes for policy analysis on the right, whether it’s the continual insistence that tax cuts pay for themselves or Paul Ryan budgets that assumed that discretionary spending could be cut to Calvin Coolidge levels.
So what has Warren achieved here? Realistically, her health care plan is more aspirational than her other plans. Enhanced financial regulation and universal child care are things she might well be able to accomplish if she not only wins, but wins big, next year. Medicare for All, not so much. And may I say, it would serve the public well if these topics — plus climate change! — got more attention in future debates, and health care a bit less.
Warren’s task was, instead, to counter criticism that she was being evasive on a big issue. I think she has met that challenge.

Texto completo: Mark,
In 2010, I wrote “The Social Network” and I know you wish I hadn’t. You protested that the film was inaccurate and that Hollywood didn’t understand that some people build things just for the sake of building them. (We do understand that — we do it every day.)
I didn’t push back on your public accusation that the movie was a lie because I’d had my say in the theaters, but you and I both know that the screenplay was vetted to within an inch of its life by a team of studio lawyers with one client and one goal: Don’t get sued by Mark Zuckerberg.
It was hard not to feel the irony while I was reading excerpts from your recent speech at Georgetown University, in which you defended — on free speech grounds — Facebook’s practice of posting demonstrably false ads from political candidates. I admire your deep belief in free speech. I get a lot of use out of the First Amendment. Most important, it’s a bedrock of our democracy and it needs to be kept strong.
But this can’t possibly be the outcome you and I want, to have crazy lies pumped into the water supply that corrupt the most important decisions we make together. Lies that have a very real and incredibly dangerous effect on our elections and our lives and our children’s lives.
Don’t say Larry Flynt. Not even Larry Flynt would say Larry Flynt. This isn’t the same as pornography, which people don’t rely upon for information. Last year, over 40 percent of Americans said they got news from Facebook. Of course the problem could be solved by those people going to a different news source, or you could decide to make Facebook a reliable source of public information.
The tagline on the artwork for “The Social Network” read, in 2010, “You don’t get to 500 million friends without making a few enemies.” That number sounds quaint just nine years later because one-third of the planet uses your website now.
And right now, on your website, is an ad claiming that Joe Biden gave the Ukrainian attorney general a billion dollars not to investigate his son. Every square inch of that is a lie and it’s under your logo. That’s not defending free speech, Mark, that’s assaulting truth.
You and I want speech protections to make sure no one gets imprisoned or killed for saying or writing something unpopular, not to ensure that lies have unfettered access to the American electorate.
Even after the screenplay for “The Social Network” satisfied the standards of Sony’s legal department, we sent the script — as promised over a handshake — to a group of senior lieutenants at your company and invited them to give notes. (I was asked if I would change the name of Harvard University to something else and if Facebook had to be called Facebook.)
After we’d shot the movie, we arranged a private screening of an early cut for your chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg. Ms. Sandberg stood up in the middle of the screening, turned to the producers who were standing in the back of the room, and said, “How can you do this to a kid?” (You were 26 years old at the time, but all right, I get it.)
I hope your C.O.O. walks into your office, leans in (as she suggested we do in her best selling book), and says, “How can we do this to tens of millions of kids? Are we really going to run an ad that claims Kamala Harris ran dog fights out of the basement of a pizza place while Elizabeth Warren destroyed evidence that climate change is a hoax and the deep state sold meth to Rashida Tlaib and Colin Kaepernick?”
The law hasn’t been written yet — yet — that holds carriers of user-generated internet content responsible for the user-generated content they carry, just like movie studios, television networks and book, magazine and newspaper publishers. Ask Peter Thiel, who funded a series of lawsuits against Gawker, including an invasion of privacy suit that bankrupted the site and forced it to close down. (You should have Mr. Thiel’s number in your phone because he was an early investor in Facebook.)
Most people don’t have the resources to employ a battalion of fact checkers. Nonetheless, while you were testifying before a congressional committee two weeks ago, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez asked you the following: “Do you see a potential problem here with a complete lack of fact-checking on political advertisements?” Then, when she pushed you further, asking you if Facebook would or would not take down lies, you answered, “Congresswoman, in most cases, in a democracy, I believe people should be able to see for themselves what politicians they may or may not vote for are saying and judge their character for themselves.”
Now you tell me. If I’d known you felt that way, I’d have had the Winklevoss twins invent Facebook.

Texto completo: Los críticos del presidente Donald Trump se burlaron en internet y lo acusaron de intentar aligerar su factura de impuestos después de que anunció el jueves que su residencia permanente sería Palm Beach, Florida, en lugar de la Torre Trump en Nueva York.
“Donald Trump no quiere que el estado de Nueva York vea sus impuestos, me pregunto por qué. Digamos esto como es: corrupción, simple y llanamente”, tuiteó el jueves la senadora Elizabeth Warren , candidata presidencial para las elecciones de 2020.
Trump, un neoyorquino de toda la vida, presentó una “declaración de domicilio” ante el Tribunal de Circuito del Condado de Palm Beach en septiembre, renunciando a su residencia en Nueva York y designando el resort Mar-a-Lago de la familia como su residencia principal, según The New York Times. El diario, que informó por primera vez el cambio de residencia de Trump, dijo que la medida tiene motivos fiscales: Florida en particular no tiene impuestos estatales sobre la renta o la herencia.
En Nueva York, Trump enfrenta el escrutinio tanto del fiscal general del estado como del fiscal de distrito de Manhattan sobre sus declaraciones de impuestos.
“Los estadounidenses de a pie no son dueños de resorts que pueden enumerar como direcciones alternativas para modificar su obligación tributaria”, tuiteó el jueves la representante Nita Lowey, demócrata de Nueva York. “Las familias de clase media hoy enfrentan más cargas impositivas mientras el presidente esquiva las consecuencias del proyecto de ley republicano”.
Dan Pfeiffer, exasesor de Obama, bromeó en un tuit el jueves: “El presidente huye a Florida para evitar pagar impuestos”.
Trump tuiteó el jueves por la noche que apreciaba su ciudad natal y “odiaba tener que tomar esta decisión”, pero “a pesar del hecho de que pago millones de dólares en impuestos municipales, estatales y locales cada año, los líderes políticos me han tratado muy mal, tanto de la ciudad como del estado “.
Agregó que Nueva York “siempre tendrá un lugar especial en mi corazón”.
La exrepresentante Gwen Graham, demócrata de Florida, reaccionó a la noticia con solo cuatro palabras: “Nosotros. No. Lo. queremos”.
Y Michael Steele, ex presidente del Comité Nacional Republicano, tuiteó: “Maldita sea, habrás sacado a Trump de #NYC”. #PobreFlorida “.
El alcalde de Nueva York, Bill de Blasio, demócrata y ex candidato de 2020, también opinó.
“No dejes que la puerta te golpee al salir o algo así”, tuiteó el jueves. De Blasio hizo un seguimiento temprano el viernes con otro mensaje: “Nuestro más sentido pésame a la buena gente de Florida mientras Trump intenta escapar de su pasado (y futuro cercano)”.
En un monólogo burlón el viernes por la mañana, Pat Kiernan , presentador de noticias matutinas durante mucho tiempo en NY1, también criticó duramente al presidente por la mudanza, específicamente el costo y las molestias que la ciudad ha soportado para proteger el perímetro de la Torre Trump en Manhattan.

DuPont: W.Va. chemical film not accurate

Texto completo: A Hollywood film that depicts an Ohio attorney's fight with Delaware's biggest company over toxic chemical pollution in West Virginia "isn't an accurate portrayal of the facts," DuPont executives said during an investor call.
Set for release later this month and starring Mark Ruffalo and Anne Hathaway, "Dark Waters" is based on a 2016 New York Times Magazine article.
It tracks Robert Bilott's path from a corporate attorney defending chemical companies to switching sides and suing DuPont for what he says was their culpability in leaking a cancer-linked chemical, known as PFOA, into the waterways and aquifers around a plant in West Virginia that produced Teflon, among other products.
Ultimately, DuPont and its 2015 spinoff, Chemours, agreed in 2017 to settle more than 3,500 lawsuits related to pollution in the state for $671 million. Both companies denied wrongdoing.
In 2016, Delaware Online/The News Journal published a four-part series telling the stories of residents who live around the former DuPont plant in Parkersburg, West Virginia, and the health problems that they blamed on PFOA pollution.
While the "Dark Waters" promotional posters proclaim "the truth has a man on the inside," DuPont CEO Marc Doyle said, "The behaviors that you might see in (the movie) are certainly not the behaviors that I witnessed at any point in my career."
In one scene in "Dark Waters," Ruffalo portrays Billot claiming that "DuPont is knowingly poisoning 70,000 local residents."
Executive Chairman Ed Breen told investors that the film is "inspired" by, not based upon, Bilott's story. Neither executive provided specifics about what within the movie is inaccurate.
Asked by a stock analyst whether DuPont might sue the movie producers, Breen said, "I'm not going to comment on the legal piece but, obviously, we have a lot of legal folks (who) have been looking at this."
Neither Bilott nor "Dark Waters" producer Focus Features replied to requests for comment.
DuPont and Chemours also face numerous lawsuits in other states over similar contamination from PFOA and its related PFAS family of chemicals, used in Teflon and other products.
Potential liabilities from the suits could reach billions of dollars.
During the earnings call this week, Breen said those liabilities are "well-managed."
"As a testament to that, we have passed the second year of a five-year sharing agreement with Chemours, and we still have paid zero dollars to them," he said.
Yet, Chemours also is suing DuPont in the Delaware Chancery Court in part over that agreement. Chemours claims DuPont, its former parent company, either agree to pay a larger chunk of environmental cleanup costs or hand over $4 billion.
Also Thursday, DuPont reported net income of $412 million for the first nine months of 2019 on sales of $16.3 billion.
Company shares gained half a percent on the day, but are down about 10% since the company ended its temporary marriage with Dow Chemical in June.

Attorney Rob Bilott will be played by Mark Ruffalo in the film "Dark Waters," set for release Nov. 22. His wife, Sarah, will be portrayed by Anne Hathaway.

Democrats: Trump relocation highlights Florida's 2020 significance

Texto completo: TALLAHASSEE -- Florida Democrats are crediting the Sunshine State's significance in next year's election for President Donald Trump's decision to declare himself a full-time Florida man.

Leaders of the Florida Democratic Party said Trump's decision to declare his Palm Beach residence as his permanent home is symbolic of the magnitude of Florida and its 29 Electoral College votes in the 2020 election.

"Donald Trump becoming a Florida man just shows that Florida is important," Florida Democratic Party Executive Director Juan PeÃ±alosa told reporters during a conference call Friday morning.

The call was focused on state Democrats' voter registration efforts in Florida, a critical swing state, with a year to go until the 2020 election.

"We have urgency right now," PeÃ±alosa said. "Him changing his voter registration just shows that he believes, as we do, that the path to the White House goes through Florida."

Thursday night, Trump confirmed a New York Times report that the president had filed documents in Palm Beach County Circuit Court declaring his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach as his and First Lady Melania Trump's permanent residence.

"1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, the White House, is the place I have come to love and will stay for, hopefully, another 5 years as we MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, but my family and I will be making Palm Beach, Florida, our Permanent Residence," Trump said in a series of tweets.

With no state income tax, Florida has long been a lure to affluent individuals. In addition, Trump's 2017 tax overhaul, which capped the amount of state and local tax deductions at $10,000, has been credited with spurring wealthy homeowners in high-tax states, such as New York, to relocate to Florida.

"I cherish New York, and the people of New York, and always will, but unfortunately, despite the fact that I pay millions of dollars in city, state and local taxes each year, I have been treated very badly by the political leaders of both the city and state," Trump tweeted. "Few have been treated worse. I hated having to make this decision, but in the end it will be best for all concerned. As President, I will always be there to help New York and the great people of New York. It will always have a special place in my heart!"

New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo seemed to relish the president's relocation.

"Good riddance. It's not like @realDonaldTrump paid taxes here anyway... He's all yours, Florida," the governor, a Democrat, tweeted Thursday night.

Since taking office, Trump has spent little time at his prior primary residence, Trump Tower in New York. Meanwhile, New York prosecutors have been seeking eight years of Trump's personal and business tax returns.

WOULD BIDEN HAVE ORDERED THE BAGHDADI RAID?

Texto completo: President Donald Trump deserves credit for ordering the operation that killed Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. It was a high-risk mission that required U.S. forces to fly hundreds of miles into al-Qaida-controlled territory to storm a heavily armed terrorist compound.
If things had gone horribly wrong, Mr. Trump would have been blamed and borne the consequences. Just ask Jimmy Carter how the Desert One disaster affected his re-election. Mr. Trump knew the political risks but gave the order to go anyway.
Would Joe Biden have done the same? Unlikely.
The former vice president advised Barack Obama not to carry out the raid that killed Osama bin Laden. As Mark Bowden, author of "The Finish: The Killing of Osama bin Laden," explained in 2012, "The only major dissenters were Biden and [then-Defense Secretary Robert] Gates, and before the raid was launched, Gates would change his mind."
During a meeting in the Situation Room, Mr. Biden later recalled, Mr. Obama turned to him and asked, "Joe, what do you think?" Mr. Biden answered, "Mr. President, my suggestion is don't go."
Worse, his reason had nothing to do with national security. According to Mr. Bowden, Mr. Biden told the president that "if the effort failed, Obama could say goodbye to a second term." At the moment America had the man responsible for the 9/11 attacks in her sights, Mr. Biden was worried about politics, the absolute last thing a commander in chief should be thinking about in such circumstances.
In the end, Mr. Bowden writes, "every one of the president's top advisers except Biden was in favor of immediate action."
Yet, rather than praise Mr. Trump for ordering the killing of Baghdadi, Mr. Biden blasted the president, arguing that the raid succeeded "despite his ineptitude as commander in chief."
The man who opposed the bin Laden operation criticizes the man who approved the Baghdadi operation? That's rich.
And it was the Obama-Biden administration's withdrawal from Iraq in 2011 that allowed the Islamic State to rise from the ashes of defeat and build a caliphate the size of Britain. Talk about ineptitude.
Mr. Obama's rejection of Mr. Biden's advice not to go after bin Laden does not absolve Mr. Obama of criticism for his broader policy in the fight against terrorism. After the bin Laden operation, many pointed out the irony that Mr. Obama's signature national security accomplishment was made possible by information gained from the CIA interrogation program that he had shut down on his third day in office.
As former acting CIA director Mike Morrell has explained, the key piece of intelligence that led the CIA to bin Laden - information on bin Laden's principal courier, including his nickname Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti - came from detainees in CIA custody.
Similarly, Mr. Trump's bold decision to go forward with the Baghdadi operation does not absolve him of criticism for his Syria policy. The fact is, taking out the IS leader would not have been possible without the U.S. boots on the ground that Mr. Trump has announced he is withdrawing, or without the help of the Kurdish allies whom Mr. Trump is abandoning. It was the Kurds who cultivated the source inside Baghdadi's inner circle who gave us actionable intelligence about his location.
So, the Kurds not only took 11,000 casualties in the fight to drive IS from its physical caliphate, but they also gave us the critical lead that led us to Baghdadi's doorstep. It's fair to ask whether the same operation would have been possible six months from now thanks to Mr. Trump's drawdown and betrayal of the Kurds.
Our Kurdish allies deserve better. And we still need them. According to a Pentagon inspector general's report, even before Mr. Trump's most recent withdrawal announcement, IS was "resurging in Syria." It has between 14,000 and 18,000 members, as well as about 3,000 foreign fighters under arms in Syria and Iraq. The New York Times reports that before Mr. Trump's decision to greenlight Turkey's invasion, Kurdish forces were conducting as many as a dozen counterterrorism missions a day, but now those have ceased.
The Kurds were also guarding about 10,000 captured IS fighters, including about 2,000 foreign fighters. Now, according to the State Department, more than 100 of those detainees have escaped and "we do not know where they are."
And while the loss of Baghdadi is a major blow, IS has survived similar blows before. Thanks to Mr. Trump, Baghdadi is dead. But the Islamic State is not. We still need to keep a boot on its neck, and that requires boots on the ground - and allies such as the Kurds.

Deadspin Isn't Dead, Owner Says, as Last Staff Member Signs Off

Texto completo: The site's editorial team, more than 20 journalists, resigned after an instance of what they saw as meddling by G/O Media.
And then there were none.
The exodus of staff members at the popular sports website Deadspin started on Tuesday, with the firing of the interim editor in chief, Barry Petchesky, who had refused to obey an order from higher-ups to confine the site's posts to sports-related subject matter.
On Wednesday, more than eight staff members quit in protest. The next day, more writers and editors followed. On Friday, the last remaining journalist from a staff of more than 20 -- the writer Dave McKenna -- resigned.
Diana Moskovitz, a senior editor, was technically the last one standing. She had handed in her resignation two weeks ago, and Friday was set to be her last workday. She had no idea, when she gave notice, that she would be the last of the original team to post a Deadspin story.
She spent most of Friday working from a Starbucks in Manhattan. At 10:24 a.m., she put up a post headlined "Was Deadspin a Good Sports Blog? A Very Short Debate." The article had a word count of one. "Yes," it read. By evening, it had more than 110,000 page views.
Ms. Moskovitz said no one from G/O Media -- the company that operates Deadspin and related sites like Jezebel, Kotaku and Gizmodo for the private equity firm Great Hill Partners -- had contacted her on her final workday.
"I don't know if they didn't remember or just didn't care that I was there," she said in an interview.
She noted that her access to the site's content management system was cut sometime during the afternoon.
Despite the swift collapse, Jim Spanfeller, the chief executive of G/O Media, vowed that Deadspin was not dead. "We've got quite a number of recruiters out there pounding the pavement, trying to find great people," Mr. Spanfeller said in an interview Friday. "We don't just want to get any old person -- we want to get good people."
Luis Paez-Pumar, a former Deadspin staff writer who resigned Thursday, was not convinced that the site had much of a future.
"What Deadspin was is not what it is going to be," he said, adding: "It's going to be basically a site that attempts to replicate the voice that we had, but without editors, specifically, but also writers, who really understand what that voice is."
Mr. Paez-Pumar said the staff resigned "knowing that we stood up for what we believed in, and what we believed was both horrible treatment of the site and its history, but also specifically of Barry, who is the site and its history."
Of the site's immediate future, Mr. Spanfeller said they would "make do" and put up new content. "Is this a great thing for the company? No," he said. "Is it a great thing for Deadspin? Definitely not. But we think, while it's a painful moment, we'll certainly be able to soldier on."
Tensions between the executives and the journalists had been simmering for months.
The private equity firm Great Hill Partners bought Deadspin and other digital properties that were once part of Gawker Media, as well as The Onion, from Univision in April. Gawker Media had become the property of Univision in 2016, two months after filing for bankruptcy. That company was under pressure because of a $ 140 million judgment against it from an invasion-of-privacy lawsuit brought by Terry G. Bollea, who wrestled professionally under the name Hulk Hogan. The suit was secretly funded by the billionaire Peter Thiel.
Great Hill Partners packaged its acquisitions under the name G/O Media and installed Mr. Spanfeller, formerly an executive at Forbes.com, as chief executive.
In August, Deadspin, which mainly trafficked in sports-related articles, posted a story that contained reporting critical of G/O Media and Mr. Spanfeller. The site's editor, Megan Greenwell, resigned three days after that story appeared.
A turning point came Monday, when the G/O Media editorial director, Paul Maidment, sent a memo to the Deadspin staff instructing them to stick to publishing articles that had something to do with sports. A recent Deadspin article on President Trump getting booed while attending a World Series game, for instance, was fine with him, he said.
The staff, feeling that the executives were meddling, protested the order by publishing non-sports-related material on Tuesday. Then came the editor's firing and the larger exodus.
"It was not our intent to lose anybody," Mr. Spanfeller said. "I'm sorry about what has happened, without equivocation."
He denied that he had ever wanted to quash the distinctive Deadspin voice.
"What this really came down to is a sense that they wanted to be able to write about things that were relatively far afield," he said.
The resignations lit up social media and drew a reaction from Senator Bernie Sanders, who tweeted on Thursday: "I stand with the former @Deadspin workers who decided not to bow to the greed of private equity vultures like @JimSpanfeller. This is the kind of greed that is destroying journalism across the country, and together we are going to take them on."
Ms. Greenwell, who recently worked as an advice columnist for The New York Times, posted a blog in August criticizing G/O Media management and decrying the spread of private equity among media companies.
Mr. Spanfeller pushed back on the notion that Great Hill Partners was bad for journalism. "We're trying to add jobs, not reduce jobs," he said. "We're trying to hire more journalists, not have less journalists."
Before she lost access to the site, Ms. Moskovitz published a short and sweet post at 1:07 p.m. headlined "Thank You." It expressed gratitude to the site's readers and shot quickly past 100,000 views.

Texto completo: Its deal with Sidewalk Labs harnesses private "smart city" planning to the public interest.
This week Toronto won a major fight against Big Tech. But unlike the battles underway in Washington, it wasn't over digital domains like online privacy or ad sales; rather, it was over something deep out of the city's industrial past: its waterfront.
Sidewalk Labs, a sister company of Google, had proposed rebuilding a chunk of land east of downtown in exchange for using Toronto as a beta test. In pushing back against that plan, Toronto reached a compromise that lets Sidewalk go ahead, but firmly under public control -- setting a precedent for how governments around the world can harness the potential for "smart cities" without letting Big Tech dictate the terms.
After winning a competition in 2017 to build a smart city development on a 12-acre plot of derelict publicly owned land called Quayside, Sidewalk offered a dazzling array of innovations intended not just to push Toronto into the future, but also to act as a test bed and a model for similar developments worldwide.
The proposals blended "The Jetsons" and "Portlandia": heated sidewalks, robot trash collectors, mandated mass-timber construction, and a focus on bikes, transit and autonomous vehicles for getting around. But what really made the plan tick were ubiquitous sensors to collect huge amounts of human and environmental data to make everything run more efficiently.
Many Toronto residents liked the plan, at least at first; it tapped into a frustration -- common here as in most modern cities -- over the messiness and slowness in getting big ideas built. Suddenly, here was a rich benefactor that would pay for a dream district, overcoming budget shortfalls and bureaucratic reticence, and in the process make the city a global showcase.
But Sidewalk kept pushing the boundaries. While the initial competition that the company won in 2017 was limited to the Quayside district, the company later asked for a 190-acre swath of the adjacent Toronto Port Lands neighborhood. That land, which abuts the downtown business district, lies unused now, but the city sees its potential for future development, and is spending $ 1 billion to improve flood protection. Giving it to Sidewalk would mean giving over control of one of the most promising parts of the city.
And rather than engage with the city's existing planning infrastructure, Sidewalk assembled its own: It established company-run advisory panels and reportedly discussed the plans with thousands of Toronto residents.
But to many in the community, the company was not really listening. Sidewalk put forward terms for the collection and management of the data coming in through the sensors, terms that raised local concerns about privacy, especially because they would require new rules on how to manage such a novel arrangement.
Sidewalk's ambition is typical of the way that tech companies are dealing with cities around the world. While they are offering potentially transformative technologies, they also want the same level of control to design, monitor and make money from urban space that they have in the digital world.
The decision over whether to approve the plan was up to Waterfront Toronto, a government agency, and until the last minute it was unclear which way it would go. Boosters said the project would bring in countless jobs and global prestige, while warning that rejecting the plan would leave Toronto with a permanent mark as a Luddite metropolis.
Instead, the agency, backed by growing public opposition to the company's overreach, pushed for a compromise. Sidewalk can proceed, but only on the original 12 acres. It has to work with local developers. And any data collected would be treated as a public asset, not the company's property. If the company plays well, more development opportunities may follow.
The deal isn't done -- Toronto and Sidewalk Labs have another five months to evaluate the proposal, and either side could pull out. That means that the city has to keep its focus on the public interest. What, in that context, does success mean? For Sidewalk, it might mean profits, or proofs of concept; for the city, it means widely shared improvements in things like jobs, the environment, public health and housing costs.
The city has to be willing to walk away. Sidewalk is not the only entity interested in the Quayside land, even if it has some very shiny ideas to offer. But the city also has strong incentives to make the deal work. Managed properly, it could be a boon for Toronto's future.
Toronto's experience with Sidewalk Labs to date shows that cities do not need to give up government's responsibility to prioritize the public interest while pursuing urban innovation. And that's a lesson not just for other places considering privately developed smart city plans, but also for any government grappling with the challenges and promise of Big Tech.

Leon adapts 'American Son' play to Netflix

Texto completo: ATLANTA - For Kerry Washington's vulnerable Kendra Ellis-Connor in Netflix's film "American Son," there is no Olivia Pope to save her. Nothing is "handled."
In this emotional adaptation of the' successful Broadway stage play, Kendra faces not-so-subtle prejudice from a cop, marital resentment over her estranged white husband Scott Connor (Steven Pasquale) and a confused bi-racial teen son Jamal who has disappeared.
The entire movie, with the exception of a few flashbacks, takes place in a Miami police waiting room in the middle of the night. There are only four speaking roles, including the two cops tasked to figuring out what happened to Jamal.
Atlanta playwright and director Kenny Leon - who seamlessly toggles between film and stage - wanted "American Son" on a platform where it could be seen by millions as oppose to thousands on Broadway. Netflix, with 150 million-plus subscribers, is as big as it gets.
"I always thought the story lent itself to being an even better film than play," Leon said in a recent phone interview. "The challenge was to keep the camera moving and . keep the tension in the room. It needed a cinematic point of view."
He said, given the horrible weather outside and overnight setting, the entire film feels like a horror flick, as in "a mother's worst nightmare."
Leon purposely chose not to show what Jamal looks like because he wanted people to feel like it could be anybody's son. Thus, the title: "American Son."
All four actors were in the stage play so Leon spent two days helping them adjust to a film version. That meant being less demonstrative, more internalized. But all four actors have film experience, he said, so it wasn't a tough transition.
He had three hand-held or Steadicam operators and two boom operators. So he had up to nine people in this dance of sorts. "I taught them how to dance," he said, in a sense.
The entire movie was shot in just four and a half days on a Brooklyn sound stage. Given the density of dialogue, that averaged to 23 pages of script a day.
For Washington, it was the toughest because she was in almost every scene, every second.
"She is the real deal," Leon said. "While the stage play was seen through four people's eyes, the film is seen through her eyes. She gave me 100% every take."
Washington embraced a role where she wears virtually no makeup and has to spill her guts for hours on end. "She turned in a great piece of art to say something to the world," Leon said. "And she trusted me. I'm forever grateful to that."
Kendra's despair and frustration while talking with the overnight cop Faul Larkin (played by Jerery Jordan) is palpable during the first 20 minutes. His condescending, often racially prejudiced questioning (Does her son have any tattoos? Does he have any aliases?) only makes the situation worse.
But the dynamic changes when Kendra's husband, an FBI agent, shows up. Larkin is far more helpful and kind with the white dude. Eventually, the daytime "public information officer" (played with intensity by Eugene Lee) shows up and the atmosphere shifts yet again - and not necessarily for the better.
Leon loves the dynamic between Washington and Pasquale, an inter-racial couple with both commonalities and experiential differences. "They are a believable couple," he said. "They look right together."
Bottom line: Race and police brutality are interwoven into this story and Leon hopes it inspires not just conversation but action: "Hopefully we can get past thoughts and prayers and do something."

Texto completo: MULTAN, Pakistan - A raging fire swept through a train in Pakistan's eastern Punjab Province on Thursday killing 74 people and survivors said afterward it took nearly 20 minutes for the train to stop amid contradictory reports about the condition of the train's brakes.
Three carriages were consumed by flames from a fire caused by a cooking gas stove and dozens of people jumped in panic from the speeding train.
Conductor Sadiue Ahmed Khan told The Associated Press the train's emergency breaking system was in perfect working order and the train stopped within three minutes after the first signs of fire.
"This is the worst tragedy in my life as a driver," he said.
Investigators said they will be looking at the train's braking system to determine its condition at the time of the fire. Survivors recounted pulling at emergency cords that weave through the train to notify the conductor, but they said the train continued to speed down the tracks.
Ghulam Abbas, a passenger who had gotten on the train in the town of Nawabshah in neighboring Sindh Province with his wife and two children, echoed other passengers who said it took nearly 20 minutes for the train to stop. He recounted watching panicked passengers jumping off the speeding locomotive.
"We learned afterward that most of them had died," he said.
Abbas' wife, Sulai Khan Eibi, said she was horrified about what could have happened to their two small children. "We were so close no death, but Allah saved us," she said, clutching the children.
The train, which was traveling from the southern Arabian Sea port city of Karachi to Rawalpindi, just 6 miles from the federal capital, was carrying 857 passengers. Most of the dead were members of Tableeqi-e-Jamaat, an organization of Islamic missionaries. The fire was believed to have started in their compartment.
Mufti Wahab, a district chief of the Tableeqi-e-Jamaat, said as many as 52 members of his organization were "martyred because of the fire."
The fire apparently starred after one of several small stoves brought on to the train by the the Tableeqi members exploded setting other gas cylinders used to fuel the stoves on fire, said Deputy Railways Commissioner Jamil Ahmed.
Flames roared through the train engulfing three carriages as it approached the town of Laquatpur in Punjab. Survivors recounted horrific scenes of fellow passengers screaming as they jumped through windows and off the train, flames billowing from the carriages.
"We could hear people crying and screaming for help," said Chaudhry Shujaat, who had boarded the train just a few hours earlier with his wife and two children. "I thought we would die. The next car was on fire. We felt so helpless."
In Pakistan, poor passengers often bring their own small gas stoves on the trains to cook their meals, despite rules to the contrary, according to Railways Minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed. Safety regulations are often ignored in the overcrowded trains.
Railway official Shabir Ahmed said bodies of passengers were scattered over a 1-mile-wide area around the site. - (The New York Times

Warren, a senator from Massachusetts, has promised to repeal the corporate tax cuts signed by President Trump in 2017. But doing so, Goldman Sachs warned in a note to investors Friday, will cut S&P 500 earnings by 11%.
“Every one percentage point increase in effective tax rate translates into a roughly 1% decrease in S&P 500 earnings per share,” David Kostin wrote in a note.
Raising the effective tax rate from 18% to 26% would lessen the bank’s 2021 S&P 500 earnings per share estimate by roughly 11%, he and his team said.
Warren and her Democratic presidential rivals have made the tax reform package passed by the GOP-controlled Congress a punching bag and vowed to roll back provisions of the law if elected.
In addition to raising the corporate tax rate, Warren's plan unveiled a tax that would apply to companies that report more than $100 million in profits. Under the Massachusetts senator’s “Real Corporate Profits Tax,” corporations would pay a 7% tax on every dollar above the $100 million.
Warren said that the new tax would ensure large companies cannot take advantage of loopholes in the tax code that lessen their tax burden.
“To raise the revenue we need — and ensure every corporation pays their fair share — we need a new kind of tax that big companies can’t get around,” Warren wrote in April.
Among the large field of Democratic presidential hopefuls, Warren has surged to second behind former Vice President Joe Biden, according to a polling average from Real Clear Politics. But a New York Times/Siena College poll of likely Iowa Democratic caucuses voters released Friday had Warren leading.

Texto completo: Utah Gov. Gary Herbert wrote a letter to President Donald Trump asking that more refugees be sent to Utah to resettle, saying there is plenty of room and resources for those in need.
The Oct. 24 letter comes after the Trump administration cut the number of refugees the United States would accept over the next year to 18,000, and as the number of displaced people across the world has reached more than 70 million, according to the United Nations refugee agency.
The U.S. will take in 12,000 fewer refugees than it did last year, which was already significantly fewer than the 110,000 that President Barack Obama allowed in during his last year in office, The New York Times reports.
The same day the Trump administration announced those reduced refugee program numbers, it also issued an executive order giving states the power to accept refugees — or not.

Herbert’s letter was in response to that order and asks the president to allow Utah to take in more displaced people.
Utah has been able to accept more than 1,000 refugees each year, but those numbers have decreased significantly over the past two years, and it seems that trend will continue, Herbert writes.
“We know the need has not decreased," he said, “and are eager to see the number of admittances rise again.”
Herbert said the history of Utah — as a haven for members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints fleeing religious persecution — informs its approach to refugees, and that many Utahns empathize with the plight of those who have been forced from their homes.
He added those who resettle in Utah become a part of their communities and become productive workers and citizens.
“They become contributors in our schools, churches and other civic institutions, even helping serve more recent refugees and thus generating a beautiful cycle of charity,” he wrote. “This marvelous compassion is simply embedded in our state’s culture.”
Aden Batar, director of Migration and Refugee Services for Catholic Community Services in Utah, said he’s seen firsthand that fewer refugees are coming into the state and applauds Herbert for his effort to get more to settle here.
He said Utah has enough jobs, housing and other resources to accommodate a larger influx of refugees.
This year, he said, Utah received around 500 refugees but has helped more than 1,000 in the past.
Accepting more displaced people will save lives, Batar added. And he would know — he and his family came to Utah in 1994 as Somalian refugees.
“Individuals we are resettling are human beings. They’re brothers and sisters who are fleeing persecution," Batar said. "They want a place to come and start a new life.”
This isn’t the first time Herbert has spoken out on behalf of refugees.
In 2015, he broke ranks with many of his Republican counterparts in other states by not trying to block Syrian refugees from resettling in Utah after deadly terrorist attacks in Paris.
He issued a statement at the time saying, “Utahns are well known for our compassion for those who are fleeing the violence in their homeland, and we will work to do all we can to ease their suffering without compromising public safety.”

It's official: Trump declares Florida as primary residence

Texto completo: President Trump — rich, bombastic and to many Americans the epitome of a New Yorker — has always been ­intertwined with the city that he called his lifelong home.
No longer.
In late September, Trump changed his primary residence from Manhattan to Palm Beach, Fla., according to documents that were filed in Palm Beach County Circuit Court.
Melania Trump, the first ­lady, also changed her legal residence­ to Palm Beach in an identical document.
Each of the Trumps filed a “declaration of domicile" saying that the Mar-a-Lago Club, Trump's resort in Palm Beach, will be their permanent residence.
“If I maintain another place or places of abode in some ­other state or states," reads the document that President Trump filed.
“I hereby declare that my above-described residence and abode in the state of Florida constitutes my predominant and principal home, and I intend to continue it permanently as such."
“I formerly resided at 721 Fifth Avenue," the document says, referring to Trump Tower, which has been his primary residence since he moved into the skyscraper off 57th Street in Midtown Manhattan in 1983.
An attachment lists his “other­ places of abode" as 1600 Pennsylvania Ave., the address of the White House, and his private golf club in Bedminster, N.J.
Since becoming president, Trump has spent 99 days at Mar-a-Lago, compared with 20 days at Trump Tower.
White House officials declined to say why Trump changed his primary residence, but a person who is close to the president said that the decision was made primarily for tax purposes.
It was unclear how much time Trump would be spending in New York in the future. Under­ New York state law, if he spends more than 184 days a year there, he will have to pay state income taxes.
Leaving New York could also­ save money for Trump's heirs at the time of his death. New York imposes a top estate tax rate of 16 percent for estates larger than $10.1 million.
Florida, which doesn't have a state income tax or an inheritance tax, has long been a place for the wealthy to escape the higher taxes of the Northeast.

Cybersecurity service promises to be bipartisan
Robby Mook and Matt Rhoades are from different sides of the political aisle.
Mook, a Democrat, was the campaign manager for Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign.
Rhoades, a Republican, ran Mitt Romney's presidential run in 2012.
But the two men share a common experience: Both of the campaigns that they ran were targeted by foreign adversaries.
Now, Mook and Rhoades are doing something about it.
They have created a nonprofit, which opened for business on Thursday, with the goal of providing free or low-cost cybersecurity­ services to congressional and presidential candidates.
Called Defending Digital Campaigns, the business plans to serve as a clearinghouse that connects campaigns with cybersecurity­ companies.
Their endeavor was made possible by a May opinion from the Federal Election Commission concluding that DDC's discounted or free cybersecurity services would not run afoul of campaign finance laws.
"This is a nonpartisan organization, and we want to be able to have credibility to go in and help Democratic campaigns, Republican campaigns, conservative campaigns, and even liberal campaigns," said Rhoades, who is co-chief executive of the Republican lobbying firm CGCN Group.

Activism isn't about casting stones, Obama warns
Former President Barack Obama made a rare foray into the cultural conversation this week, objecting to the prevalence of “callout culture" and “wokeness" during an interview about youth activism at the Obama Foundation summit on Tuesday.
For more than an hour, Obama sat onstage with the actress­ Yara Shahidi and several other young leaders from around the world.
“This idea of purity and you're never compromised and you're always politically 'woke' and all that stuff — You should get over that quickly," Obama said.
“The world is messy; there are ambiguities," he continued. “People who do really good stuff have flaws. People who you are fighting may love their kids and share certain things with you."
Obama spoke repeatedly of the role of social media in activism, specifically, including the idea of what's become known as “cancel culture," which tends to refer to behavior that mostly plays out on the Internet when someone has said or done something to which others ­object. That person is then ­condemned in a flurry of social media posts.
“I do get a sense sometimes now among certain young people — and this is accelerated by social media — there is this sense sometimes of, 'The way of me making change is to be as judgmental as possible about other people,' " he said, “and that's enough."
“That's not activism. That's not bringing about change," he said. “If all you're doing is casting stones, you're probably not going to get that far. That's easy to do."

Texto completo: "Superintelligence" is a flawed concept and shouldn't inform our policy decisions.
Intelligent machines catastrophically misinterpreting human desires is a frequent trope in science fiction, perhaps used most memorably in Isaac Asimov's stories of robots that misconstrue the famous "three laws of robotics." The idea of artificial intelligence going awry resonates with human fears about technology. But current discussions of superhuman A.I. are plagued by flawed intuitions about the nature of intelligence.
We don't need to go back all the way to Isaac Asimov -- there are plenty of recent examples of this kind of fear. Take a recent Op-Ed essay in The New York Times and a new book, "Human Compatible," by the computer scientist Stuart Russell. Dr. Russell believes that if we're not careful in how we design artificial intelligence, we risk creating "superintelligent" machines whose objectives are not adequately aligned with our own.
As one example of a misaligned objective, Dr. Russell asks, "What if a superintelligent climate control system, given the job of restoring carbon dioxide concentrations to preindustrial levels, believes the solution is to reduce the human population to zero?" He claims that "if we insert the wrong objective into the machine and it is more intelligent than us, we lose."
Dr. Russell's view expands on arguments of the philosopher Nick Bostrom, who defined A.I. superintelligence as "an intellect that is much smarter than the best human brains in practically every field, including scientific creativity, general wisdom and social skills." Dr. Bostrom and Dr. Russell envision a superintelligence with vast general abilities unlike today's best machines, which remain far below the level of humans in all but relatively narrow domains (such as playing chess or Go).
Dr. Bostrom, Dr. Russell and other writers argue that even if there is just a small probability that such superintelligent machines will emerge in the foreseeable future, it would be an event of such magnitude and potential danger that we should start preparing for it now. In Dr. Bostrom's view, "a plausible default outcome of the creation of machine superintelligence is existential catastrophe." That is, humans would be toast.
These thinkers -- let's call them the "superintelligentsia" -- speculate that if machines were to attain general human intelligence, the machines would quickly become superintelligent. They speculate that a computer with general intelligence would be able to speedily read all existing books and documents, absorbing the totality of human knowledge. Likewise, the machine would be able to use its logical abilities to make discoveries that increase its cognitive power.
Such a machine, the speculation goes, would not be bounded by bothersome human limitations, such as slowness of thought, emotions, irrational biases and need for sleep. Instead, the machine would possess something like a "pure" intelligence without any of the cognitive shortcomings that limit humans.
The assumption seems to be that this A.I. could surpass the generality and flexibility of human intelligence while seamlessly retaining the speed, precision and programmability of a computer. This imagined machine would be far smarter than any human, far better at "general wisdom and social skills," but at the same time it would preserve unfettered access to all of its mechanical capabilities. And as Dr. Russell's example shows, it would lack humanlike common sense.
The problem with such forecasts is that they underestimate the complexity of general, human-level intelligence. Human intelligence is a strongly integrated system, one whose many attributes -- including emotions, desires, and a strong sense of selfhood and autonomy -- can't easily be separated.
Similarly, if generally intelligent A.I. is ever created (something that will take many decades, if not centuries), its objectives, like ours, will not be easily "inserted" or "aligned." They will rather develop along with the other qualities that form its intelligence, as a result of being embedded in human society and culture. The machines' push to achieve these objectives will be tempered by the common sense, values and social judgment without which general intelligence cannot exist.
What's more, the notion of superintelligence without humanlike limitations may be a myth. It seems likely to me that many of the supposed deficiencies of human cognition are inseparable aspects of our general intelligence, which evolved in large part to allow us to function as a social group. It's possible that the emotions, "irrational" biases and other qualities sometimes considered cognitive shortcomings are what enable us to be generally intelligent social beings rather than narrow savants. I can't prove it, but I believe that general intelligence can't be isolated from all these apparent shortcomings, either in humans or in machines that operate in our human world.
In his 1979 Pulitzer Prize-winning book, "Gödel, Escher, Bach: an Eternal Golden Braid," the cognitive scientist Douglas Hofstadter beautifully captures the counterintuitive complexity of intelligence by posing a deceptively simple question: "Will a thinking computer be able to add fast?" Dr. Hofstadter's surprising but insightful answer was, "perhaps not."
As Dr. Hofstadter explains: "We ourselves are composed of hardware which does fancy calculations but that doesn't mean that our symbol level, where 'we' are, knows how to carry out the same fancy calculations. Let me put it this way: There's no way that you can load numbers into your own neurons to add up your grocery bill. Luckily for you, your symbol level (i.e., you) can't gain access to the neurons which are doing your thinking -- otherwise you'd get addlebrained." So, why, he asks, "should it not be the same for an intelligent program?"
In other words, the intelligent part of your mind can't harness the fast-adding skills of your own neurons, and for good reason. This barrier -- between the "self" that you are aware of and the detailed activity of your brain -- permits the kind of thinking that matters for survival without getting overwhelmed ("addlebrained") by your own thought processes. Similarly, a thinking computer's hardware, like ours, would presumably include circuits for fast arithmetic, but at the level of its cognitive awareness, the machine wouldn't be able to tap into these circuits any more than we humans can.
It's fine to speculate about aligning an imagined superintelligent -- yet strangely mechanical -- A.I. with human objectives. But without more insight into the complex nature of intelligence, such speculations will remain in the realm of science fiction and cannot serve as a basis for A.I policy in the real world.
Understanding our own thinking is a hard problem for our plain old intelligent minds. But I'm hopeful that we, and our future thinking computers, will eventually achieve such understanding in spite of -- or perhaps thanks to -- our shared lack of superintelligence.

A few nagging questions

Texto completo: A standard theme in detective thrillers is that the perpetrator feels compelled to return to the scene of the crime. It's an irrational urge, and readers of such potboilers are often left wondering whether the protagonist secretly wants to get caught.
Perhaps we're living a real-life version of this fictional plot in President Trump's alleged solicitation of political help from Ukraine, which this week spawned a full-blown impeachment probe. Republicans question whether the Ukraine events have the weight of "high crimes and misdemeanors." But when seen as part of a pattern of behavior, the gravity becomes clearer.
Trump survived his first effort to solicit foreign political help in his appeals to Russia for damaging information about Hillary Clinton during the 2016 presidential campaign. But soon after Trump was cleared of "collusion" by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III, he seemingly went at it again - this time demanding political dirt from Ukraine's new president, Volodymyr Zelensky, as a condition of delivering military assistance to Kyiv.
Trump evidently thought he'd been exonerated, too, of obstructing Mueller's investigation (though Mueller's report is ambiguous on that question). Perhaps emboldened, the president has since appeared to deepen his obstructive behavior, trying to block witnesses from testifying before Congress about Ukraine or any other questionable presidential and personal behavior.
If this were a thriller, we'd suspect that the central character has a compulsion that he doesn't understand or control - and keeps repeating the actions that get him in trouble.
But this is reality, not bedtime reading. And now it's an impeachment investigation, as of Thursday, that requires evidence of wrongdoing rather than psychological speculation about motives. House investigators have been conducting a rapid, well-focused inquiry. But here are two nagging questions that I hope investigators can answer.
What led to Trump's first meeting on June 20, 2017, with Ukraine's then- President Petro Poroshenko? Ukraine had hired the lobbying firm BGR Group in January 2017 to foster contact with Trump, but nothing had happened . . . and then the door opened. Why?
On June 7, less than two weeks before Poroshenko's White House meeting, Trump's lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, had visited Kyiv to give a speech for the Victor Pinchuk Foundation, headed by a prominent Ukrainian oligarch. While Giuliani was there, he also met with Poroshenko and his prosecutor general, Yuriy Lutsenko, according a news release issued by the foundation.
Just after Giuliani's visit, Ukraine's investigation of the so-called black ledger that listed alleged illicit payments to former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort was transferred from an anti-corruption bureau, known as NABU , to Poroshenko's prosecutor general, according to a June 15, 2017, report in the Kyiv Post. The paper quoted Viktor Trepak, former deputy head of the country's security service, saying: "It is clear for me that somebody gave an order to bury the black ledger."
The New York Times reported in May 2018 that Ukraine had "halted cooperation" with Mueller's investigation. The paper quoted Volodymyr Ariev, a parliament ally of Poroshenko, explaining: "In every possible way, we will avoid irritating the top American officials."
Was there any implicit understanding that Poroshenko's government would curb its cooperation with the U.S. Justice Department's investigation of Manafort, who would later be indicted by Mueller?
Why was Marie Yovanovitch , the U.S. ambassador to Kyiv, fired in May? Trump, Giuliani and their allies had been attacking her since early 2018, but for what reason? Lutsenko, the Ukrainian prosecutor, told the Hill in March that she had given him a "do not prosecute" order, an incendiary charge that Donald Trump Jr. promptly echoed on Twitter. But Lutsenko later recanted, and the State Department said the story was a fabrication.
So why were Trump and Giuliani so eager to dump the ambassador? Here's what Yovanovitch said during her Oct. 11 testimony to House investigators: "Individuals who have been named in the press as contacts of Mr. Giuliani may well have believed that their personal financial ambitions were stymied by our anti-corruption policy in Ukraine."
The former ambassador may have been referring to Igor Fruman and Lev Parnas , two Giuliani clients who were indicted last month on suspicion of arranging secret contributions to help foreign governments. (Fruman and Parnas have pleaded not guilty.) Their biggest project, according to an Associated Press Oct. 7 story, was a plan to sell U.S. natural gas to Ukraine, aided by Giuliani and Energy Secretary Rick Perry's lobbying of Naftogaz, the Ukrainian gas company.
Trump's effort to play politics in Ukraine is described in an ever- widening stream of documents and testimony. The House must now assess whether Trump's behavior makes him unfit to continue in office.

Texto completo: Area Jewish Day Schools Receive State Security Funding
SEVERAL LOCAL JEWISH day schools are among nonpublic schools in Pennsylvania receiving shares of $3.2 million in public funding for security measures.
The funding will be used by the schools to buy safety and security-related equipment or to pay and train school resource officers.
Morris and Rose Caskey Torah Academy of Greater Philadelphia in Wynnewood received $23,625 in grants, while Chabad Main Line in Merion received $23,205 and Kohelet Yeshiva in Merion got $19,425.
"We thank Gov. Wolf and our state legislators for awarding these funds to nonpublic schools, making our students and educators safe," said Arielle Frankston-Morris, executive director of Teach PA, a project of the Orthodox Union that advocates for nonpublic schools to receive equitable funding. "The rise in school violence and anti-Semitic attacks motivated us to spearhead this security campaign and we are thrilled to see these awards announced."
Theatre Ariel's Salon Ariel 2019-2020 Season Debuts
Theatre Ariel's Salon Ariel 2019-2020 debuted Oct. 26 and 27 with "Exquisite Potential" by Stephen Kaplan, a play about a parent named Alan Zuckerman, who thinks his 3-year-old son David is the Messiah.
Zuckerman and his wife, Laura, visit their rabbi to verify the son's divine nature. The show then fast forwards 30 years, with David married to the rabbi's son. The two are raising their own son and "grappling with the family dynamics that evolve from a child being raised as the special one," according to a Theatre Ariel release.
Theatre Ariel's Salon Ariel season features four shows in all that are presented in homes on Montgomery County's Main Line and Greater Philadelphia neighborhoods.
The final two performances are set for Nov. 2 at 8 p.m. and Nov. 3 at 7 p.m., with more information available at theatreariel.org.
Other Salon Ariel performances will include "Handle With Care" by Jason Odell Williams on Dec. 7-8 and 14-15; "Dov 8t Ali" by Anna Ziegler on Feb. 8-9 and 15-16; and "The Scribe" by Jesse Bernstein on April 25-26 and May 2-3.
Second Season of Temple Sinai Cultural Series Debuts
Temple Sinai in Dresher's second annual Hearts and Minds Jewish Cultural Series kicked off Oct. 27 with an appearance by Daniel Okrent, author of "The Guarded Gate."
Okrent's presentation explored historical and contemporary perspectives of immigration issues, with an interview format conducted by Arcadia University history professor Geoffrey Haywood and an audience Q&A session.
Okrent was corporate editor at large at Time Inc., managing editor of Life Magazine, and the first public editor of The New York Times.
Other events in the cultural series include the film "The Passengers," at the Ambler Theater as part of the Gershman Philadelphia Jewish Film Festival on Nov. 10; an appearance Nov. 20 with Tablet Deputy Editor Stephanie Butnick about her book "The Newish Jewish Encyclopedia;" a Feb. 20 appearance by "Yes She Can" co-authors Molly Dillon and Taylor Lustig; and a March 15 event with feminist Phyllis Chelser, author of "Living History: On the Front Lines for Israel and the Jews 2003-2015."
NCJW National President Keynotes Local Chapter's 40th Anniversary Luncheon
National Council of Jewish Women national President Beatrice Kahn was the keynote speaker Oc. 29 at the Greater Philadelphia Section's 40th anniversary luncheon.
During her address, Kahn shared her insights and the future plans of the national organization, including advocacy projects of individual NCJW sections and in Israel.
Kahn is a lifelong New York City resident, a lawyer and a volunteer activist. She chaired the NCJW Trafficking Work Group from 2013-2014 and helped develop and launch Exodus: NCJW's Anti-Sex Trafficking Initiative.

Cornell Cinema presents a new restoration of 'I Am Cuba' At 7 p.m. Tuesday, Cornell Cinema will present a new digital restoration of the fascinating 1964 Cuban film "I Am Cuba," featuring an introduction by Cornell professors Patty Keller and Cecelia Lawless. A three-year-labor of love from an international filmmaking team, the film is a celebration, a cinematic paean to the Cuban revolution conceived of and filmed directly after the Cuban missile crisis. Originally re-released in 1995 with the support of Francis Ford Coppola and Martin Scorsese, this new digital restoration is a unique, wildly schizophrenic celebration of Cuban communist kitsch, mixing Slavic sensibility with Latin sensuality.

TIME RUNNING OUT TO STOP NORD STREAM 2: Time may be up for the U.S. to have any chance to stop the construction of the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline that would carry natural gas from Russia to Germany.
The Trump administration and lawmakers of both parties in Congress have complained about the project increasing European dependence on Russian energy, but the U.S. has failed to act against it.
The project appears all but inevitable after Denmark approved a permit Wednesday for the pipeline to go through the Danish seabed in its exclusive economic zone. With that move, the project — which is about 85% complete — could begin operations as soon as January, Goldman Sachs analysts said in a note.
“The U.S. didn't really try to stop this project in many meaningful ways besides speaking against it,” said Nikos Tsafos, a senior fellow with the Energy and National Security Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “For the past two years we’ve heard sanctions are coming on Nord Stream 2. But they haven't come. In some ways, the Danish permit was sort of the excuse. Something else was slowing down the project, so the U.S. didn't need to act as quickly. Now that's gone and they have a very narrow window to act. The only outlet now would be a massive escalation.”
Trump is undeterred: An Energy Department spokesperson told Josh that it continues to “strongly believe Nord Stream 2 threatens the energy and national security of our allies in Europe and increases Russia’s control over the region’s energy supply.”
“The United States will continue to examine all tools at its disposal regarding this project,” the spokesperson added. “All options are on the table.”
President Trump has previously attacked Germany for being “captive” to Russian gas.
But he missed his window: There is little the U.S. can do now, analysts say. The Trump administration, despite repeated threats, has declined to use authority under a 2017 law enacted to impose sanctions on Iran, North Korea and Russia, called the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, or CAATSA. It could also have acted without legislation under executive authority.
“If you wanted to sanction it, the party that could have done it and totally declined to do it is the administration,” said Richard Nephew, a senior research scholar at Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy. “The problem is they have not had the political will to pull the trigger.” Nephew, who directed sanctions policy at the State Department in the Obama administration, speculated the Trump administration could fear upsetting TransAtlantic relations, and possibly Russia.
Congress stalls too: In response to White House inaction, the House and Senate Foreign Relations Committee have approved legislation sanctioning construction companies that lay pipes to build the pipeline, a targeted approach intended to not upset investors in the project, which include oil and gas giant Shell. Yet House and Senate leadership have not advanced the bills to the floor.
Ted Cruz, a lead sponsor of the bill, warned Wednesday that “time is running out” to stop Nord Stream 2, and urged colleagues “to quickly pass our bipartisan bill, halt this pipeline, and deprive President Putin the resources to fuel his expansionism and military aggression."
The real impact: The Trump administration has tried to weaken Russia’s position in other ways, by encouraging the export of U.S. natural gas to Europe, partner in infrastructure development, and push through market reforms. The U.S. also may have succeeded in deterring future similar projects from Russia into Europe, Nephew said.
“The tools now exist to go after future pipelines,” he said. “That is the red line being established now by the administration and Congress. That actually is helpful.”

KEYSTONE PIPELINE SHUT OFF AFTER LEAK: Officials said 383,000 gallons of crude oil spilled out of the pipeline, which leaked Wednesday near Edinburgh, North Dakota. The spill was estimated to be about 1,500 feet long and 15 feet wide Wednesday afternoon, state environment officials said in a news release.
“At this time there is no indication that it has impacted anybody’s drinking water," Karl Rockeman, water quality director for North Dakota’s health department, told the Grand Forks Herald. “It appears to (be) contained within the area.”
The incident is the Keystone pipeline system’s third spill in less than three years. The Obama administration had halted a proposed more than 1,000-mile expansion of the pipeline — known as the controversial Keystone XL pipeline — but Trump reversed course and greenlit the XL project via presidential permit.
And the spill comes just one day after the State Department held a public hearing in Montana, where officials heard opposition to the agency’s draft supplemental environmental impact statement for the pipeline expansion.
MONIZ: REMOVING CARBON REQUIRES ‘ALL HANDS ON DECK’: Former Secretary of Energy Ernest Moniz says as many of the Energy Department’s offices as possible should be working to research and develop carbon removal technology.
The Energy Department’s innovation hub — the Advanced Research Projects Agency–Energy, or ARPA-E — should play an important role, but the department should also look beyond that to take advantage of programs like the science office and the fossil energy office, Moniz said Thursday at an event hosted by the Bipartisan Policy Center. Moniz now leads the Energy Futures Initiative, which outlined a federal research and development agenda for carbon removal in a report last month.
Moniz also said that while there’s more research and development to be done on the technology side, policymakers need to set up regulatory and legal structures to break down barriers to carbon removal — an industry the former secretary said could grow to be larger than the current global oil industry in order to meet climate targets.
But Moniz also said he is optimistic about the potential for a broad bipartisan political coalition developing to support carbon removal technologies, which include carbon capture, utilization and storage and direct air capture.
“This is getting real attention,” Moniz said. He added that though “often the pace is not the one we want,” he expects based on his own conversations with lawmakers that Congress will start making much stronger commitments to carbon removal in the next year.
WILL BIPARTISAN PUSH WARM TRUMP TO GLOBAL COOLANT DEAL? New legislation to slash potent greenhouse gas refrigerants in line with a 2016 global agreement already has the support of more than a dozen senators, with equal showing from both parties.
The bill — introduced Wednesday and led by Louisiana Republican John Kennedy and Delaware Democrat Tom Carper — would give the Environmental Protection Agency the authority to regulate hydrofluorocarbons, or HFCs, which are climate-warming refrigerant chemicals. That program would help U.S. industry meet a global deal to phase down HFCs, strongly supported by U.S. companies and environmental groups.
That global deal, though, hasn’t yet gotten the support of the White House, which would have to send it to the Senate for ratification. Appliance makers and chemical producers are hopeful the strong bipartisan support for the new bill will help break the ice with the Trump administration.
There is interest within the administration in “considering a legislative pathway to achieving the same goals, and frankly, the same benefits,” Samantha Slater, vice president of government affairs for the Air-Conditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration Institute, told Abby. She pointed to research showing implementing the global HFC deal could create as many as 33,000 U.S. manufacturing jobs.
ANOTHER STAB AT A CLEAN ELECTRICITY MANDATE: House Democrat Diana DeGette of Colorado is trying to succeed where others haven’t, unveiling a plan Wednesday for clean electricity standard.
Similar mandates have been adopted by more than half of U.S. states, and Democrats have been pushing the measure on a federal level, seeing it as more likely to attract bipartisan support than carbon taxes because the resulting higher energy costs would not be as obvious to people.
But Republicans have not signed onto previous Democratic nationwide clean electricity standard legislation introduced this year by Minnesota senator Tina Smith and New Mexico’s Ben Ray Luján, the fourth-ranked Democrat in the House.
That’s despite the bill having GOP-friendly provisions, such as allowing the use of nuclear power and carbon capture technology on coal plants to count toward the mandate, as well as wind and solar.
Degette’s bill, which she plans to formally introduce soon, has similar compromises. It aims to cut carbon emissions from electricity in half by 2030 and to net-zero by 2050.
The legislation would, among other things, create a system that would award each U.S. power plant with one “clean energy credit” for every megawatt-hour of electricity it produces without emitting carbon. Natural gas plants would be eligible for the credit, if they can demonstrate their suppliers are limiting leaks of methane. The bill would also award credits for carbon capture and storage.
HOUSE APPROVES ANTI-MINING AND DRILLING BILLS: The House approved a pair of Democratic bills Wednesday limiting mining and drilling in sensitive areas.
It voted 236-185 to pass legislation that would ban new mining leases for uranium, used to produce nuclear energy, in about 1 million acres of federal land around the Grand Canyon national park in Arizona.
“Some issues are powerful and popular enough to blast right through the usual Senate deadlock, and protecting the Grand Canyon is one of them,” said Natural Resources Committee Chairman Raul Grijalva of Arizona, the lead sponsor of the bill, expressing optimism this was more than a messaging exercise.
A second bill approved 245-174 would permanently ban federal oil and natural gas leasing on roughly 316,000 acres of land around New Mexico’s Chaco Canyon.
WORLD BANK MUST BE ‘ALL-OF-THE-ABOVE,’ GOP SENATORS SAY: The World Bank must eliminate barriers keeping it from supporting coal, oil, and gas projects, a group of Republican senators say.
“Over the last several years, the World Bank has essentially prohibited public financing of high efficiency power stations fueled by coal in the developing world,” the senators, led by Wyoming Repubican John Barrasso, wrote in a letter Thursday to World Bank President David Malpass.
The senators say by doing so, the World Bank is blocking developing countries from being able to “retire older and dirtier facilities and help them move to cleaner energy production.”
KEEP EFFICIENCY FUNDS AT THEIR HIGHEST, COALITION SAYS: Efficiency groups and several companies are urging lawmakers to maintain strong funding support for the Energy Department’s efficiency programs as they negotiate the department’s fiscal year 2020 spending bill.
“As our society grows ever more dependent on energy to power our daily lives, now is not the time to abandon or shortchange the important work carried out by U.S. DOE,” the coalition wrote in a letter Wednesday to top House and Senate appropriators.
The coalition includes efficiency advocacy groups like the Alliance to Save Energy, the Business Council for Sustainable Energy, and Advanced Energy Economy and companies like Daikin, DuPont, and Ingersoll Rand.
The group is also calling on lawmakers in the House and Senate to maintain what they say are critical aspects of budget report language related to staffing concerns in the Energy Department’s efficiency and renewables office and implementation of programs like ENERGY STAR, the Building Technology Office, industrial manufacturing programs, and more.
SMITH: DEFENDING THE OIL IS LEGIT: House Armed Services Committee Chairman Adam Smith, a Democrat, is cool with Trump’s decision to reposition U.S. forces in Syria to protect oil fields in the eastern part of the country, while opposing his overall Syria policy as “incoherent.”
“A part of what they are doing in protecting those oil fields is trying to make sure that they don't fall into the hands of ISIS, because when ISIS controlled this territory, one of the things that they did was they took that oil and they sold it on the black market to make money and finance their terrorist ambitions,” Smith said on CNN Wednesday.
“So, yes, I do think it's an acceptable mission, but it is an incoherent policy,” he added. “Because if you are willing to show up and protect the oil fields from ISIS, why were you not willing to protect the Kurds, who are the single most important group in fighting ISIS? That's the inconsistency and the policy that's deeply troubling.”

Texto completo: Un Dreamer lucha para frenar la deportación de su madre, una paciente de cáncer en etapa cuatro.
De acuerdo con New York Times, la hondureña Tania Romero se encuentra bajo custodia de ICE después de ser detenida en el tráfico en el condado de Gwinnett en Georgia . La mujer tenía orden de deportación desde 2008 por no asistir a sus audiencias en una orden de inmigración.
Sin embargo, su hijo Cristian Padilla Romero probó que la mujer de 48 años nunca recibió las citaciones. Los sobres fueron devueltos a ICE por el Servicio Postal del Estados Unidos .
El joven es un estudiante de doctorado en la prestigiosa Universidad de Yale. Desde allí ha promovido una campaña para frenar la deportación de su madre y costear los gastos médicos de su tratamiento para el cáncer oral.
Relacionado: Pequeño detalle lo salvó de la deportación y le dio la residencia. Pero ahora le pedían $100,000
“Me guió, trabajó en tres empleos para mantenerme”, dijo Padilla, quien llegó a Estados Unidos a los siete años, al Times. “Mi madre es la principal razón por la que voy a Yale”.
El inmigrante, que también es indocumentado pero protegido por el DACA, también ha denunciado que su madre no ha recibido la atención médica que su madre requiere en este momento.
Romero cruzó la frontera ilegalmente hace unos 20 años . Ha trabajado limpiando casas, lavando platos y en construcción.
ICE dijo al Times que por privacidad no puede hablar del caso.
La campaña en GoFundMe para ayudar a los Romero la puedes encontrar aquí.

Dem chair criticized for saying Trump 'aligned with ISIS'

Texto completo: Hours before President Donald Trump announced the death of the leader of ISIS, the chairwoman of the Arizona Democratic Party said in public remarks that Trump had aligned himself with the terrorist organization.
The Arizona Republican Party hit Felecia Rotellini on Tuesday for her ill-timed remark at Saturday's "We the Voters Conference" hosted by the Citizens Clean Elections Commission in downtown Phoenix.
During a panel discussion, Rotellini explained why she thought people will show up to vote in 2020.
"Another reason why people are going to vote (is) because Donald Trump is manipulating the White House and has aligned himself with ISIS and Saudi Arabia," Rotellini said.
State Republican Chairwoman Kelli Ward, who was part of the same panel, immediately interjected. "I have to say that is not true. That is not true," Ward said as Rotellini tried to continue.
'Poor choice of words' The remarks came as American forces began a raid in Syria that trapped Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the world's most wanted terrorist, who blew himself up in a tunnel, along with three children, according to Trump's telling of al-Baghdadi's final moments.
"It was a poor choice of words," Matt Grodsky, spokesman for the Arizona Democratic Party, said in an email to The Arizona Republic on Tuesday.
Grodsky said the comments stemmed from, "President Trump's haphazard decision to withdraw troops from Syria, which has been opposed by Republicans and Democrats alike because it abandoned our Kurdish allies in the fight against ISIS, empowered Iran, Russia, and the Syrian regime, and hurt our interests in the region."
Ward, who has had more than a few cringe-inducing remarks of her own, hit back at Rotellini for what she viewed as slanderous comments.
"It is extremely disconcerting to hear the top Democrat in Arizona slander and malign an innocent person for being aligned with the world's most evil terrorists, let alone the president of the United States," she said.
"While fear-mongering from the left is expected up to a point, we have to draw the line somewhere if they're going to refuse to police themselves. Baseless statements like those made by the chair of the Arizona (Democratic Party) are wildly irresponsible and not rooted in reality."
Comment follows troop pullback Rotellini's comment came as people across the political spectrum wrestled with Trump's decision to withdraw at least some troops from northern Syria after the Turkish offensive into the territory previously held by Kurds aligned with the U.S.
Democrats and Republicans alike said the move empowered ISIS and sent a bad message to U.S. allies.
Trump gained a measure of redemption with the announcement Sunday that al-Baghdadi was dead.
The credit has proven fleeting for the administration, amid reports that Trump's withdrawal orders forced the Pentagon to speed up the long-planned raid on al-Baghdadi's location.
The New York Times reported that U.S. officials determined his whereabouts with a tip and collaboration with Iraqi and Kurdish intelligence officials.

'Before and After' book tour to wind up with B&amp;N homecoming on Monday

Texto completo: Imagine a bestselling novel giving birth to a non-fiction sequel.
Consider what might happen if everyday people read a fictional story and wanted to explore their similar real-life stories.
Think about two longtime author friends, who had never considered collaborating, deciding to research and write a book together. But first they would bring together a group of strangers from across the country in Memphis, Tenn., where lives had been forever changed when the strangers were infants or young children in the clutches of the Tennessee Children's Home Society (TCHS).
That's the story of my new book, "Before and After: The Incredible Real-Life Stories of Orphans Who Survived the Tennessee Children's Home Society," which released last week (October 22) from Ballentine, an imprint of Penguin Random House.
I wrote the book with buddy Lisa Wingate, author of the No. 1 New York Times bestselling novel, "Before We Were Yours," who came to me in April 2018 to ask if I might be interested in helping preserve these stories. With the energy and mercy of friendship and an unwavering faith in the power of stories, we embarked on this project, convinced we had to share the voices of these heroes who survived a horrific piece of U.S. history.
To say that the opportunity to work with my talented friend is a blessing is an understatement. Not only is Lisa a dear friend, she has achieved rock star status in the book community. "Before We Were Yours," her thirtieth book, is a publishing phenomenon, having sold more than 2.2 million copies. Working with her has been like a yearlong writing class.
In a thrilling turn, Lisa and I gathered for a second time this past weekend (Oct. 25-27) in Memphis with numerous adoptees and family members who passed around their copies of "Before and After" to sign for each other. To be together again with people who entrusted us to interview them at length and write their stories was an incredibly moving experience.
About the Tennessee Children's Home Society From the 1920s through 1950, Georgia Tann ran a black-market baby business at the Tennessee Children's Home Society in Memphis. She provided more than 5,000 "orphans" tailored to the wish lists of eager parents—hiding the fact that many weren't truly orphans but stolen sons and daughters of poor families, desperate single mothers and women told in maternity words that their babies died.
We profile 15 adoptees and tell the moving and sometimes shocking ways in which they were separated from their birth families. Many have reunited with siblings in the final decades of their lives, and some visited with newfound relatives while we were in Memphis.
These are such awesome people, and their stories matter. They are heroes.
The book tour comes together This column comes to you from the midst of a two-week book tour to celebrate the release of "Before and After." Since Oct. 22, Lisa and I have spoken together about the book —and sold out of copies—to large crowds in Dallas and McKinney, Texas; on television and to standing-room-only crowds back in Memphis; to more than 100 people at a library event in Sheffield, Ala.; to a packed room at Parnassus book store in Nashville; and to more than 200 readers in Huntsville, Ala.
This Saturday afternoon (Nov. 2), I'll be at the incredible Tattered Cover mothership store in Denver with the child of a TCHS adoptee, while Lisa flies out to speak at a writer's conference.
Happily the tour concludes with my talk and signing at 7 p.m. Monday (Nov. 4) at Barnes & Noble Booksellers in Shreveport, back with readers who have supported and encouraged me since my first book came out.
And more: The event will include a book fair for Common Ground Community, a nonprofit that helps students in the Cedar Grove community learn to read and provides a variety of after-school activities. A portion of all sales at Barnes & Noble that day will benefit Common Ground.
"Before and After: The Incredible Real-Life Stories of Orphans Who Survived the Tennessee Children's Home Society," is available in hardcover, audio and e-book formats, from your favorite booksellers, including Amazon and Barnes & Noble Booksellers. We've put together a free book-club kit with discussion questions and behind-the-scenes info, and it's available at www.judychristie.com.
I look forward to talking with you about it in Shreveport on Monday. Hope to see you there.
Book columnist Judy Christie is the author of 18 books, including 10 novels and the nonfiction "Before and After: The Incredible Real-Life Stories of Orphans Who Survived the Tennessee Children's Home Society."

Texto completo: A poll of Florida voters shows a majority oppose impeaching President Donald Trump and removing him from office.
The poll, released Wednesday, shows 53% of Florida voters oppose impeaching and removing Trump, with 42% supporting.
The New York Times Upshot/Siena College poll also found 49% of Florida voters support the impeachment inquiry being conducted by the House of Representatives, with 44% opposing the inquiry.
The results were released a day before the House is set to vote on procedures for public hearings, which are the next step in the impeachment inquiry.
The poll was conducted from Oct. 13-26 - before Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman told investigators on Monday that the White House summary of a call between Trump and the Ukranian president left out key information.
Impeachment and removal
by group
Gender: Women are more supportive of impeachment and removal than men. Among men, it's 38% in support and 57% opposed. Among women, 46% to 48%.
Race: Majorities of black and Hispanic voters support impeachment and removal. White voters are opposed. Among whites, 32% in support and 63% opposed. Among black voters, 67% are in support and 15% opposed. Among Hispanics, the split is 53% to 42%.
Age: There's relatively little difference based on age. The youngest voters, age 18 to 29, split 48% in support and 49% opposed. Voters 65 and older split 46% to 51%.
Political party: The biggest difference, not surprisingly, is shown in people of different political parties. Democrats support impeachment and removal 85% to 11%. Republicans are the opposite, with 8% in support and 88% opposed. Independent voters lean against it, with 35% supporting and 59% opposed.
Florida better
for Trump
The New York Time Upshot/Siena College Poll is part of its battleground series of surveys that look at voter attitudes in key states likely to decide the outcome of next year's presidential election: Arizona, Florida, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.
Florida stands out in greater support for the president and opposition to acting against him than in the six states as a whole.
Among all six battleground states, 44% support and 52% oppose impeaching and removing Trump. Florida's 42% support is tied with Michigan for the lowest level of support. Florida's 53% opposition is tied for North Carolina at the highest opposition.
The House impeachment inquiry is supported by 51% of voters in the battleground states and opposed by 44%.
Florida's 49% support is lowest of the six states. Florida's opposition to the inquiry matches most of the states at 44%.
Paying attention
The poll found that 75% of Florida voters are following the discussion about Trump, Ukraine and impeachment very or somewhat closely. Another 23% weren't following it closely or weren't following it at all.
Trump's dealings with the Ukrainian president, and whether the president withheld military aid in an attempt to get the Ukrainians to come up with dirt on presidential candidate Joe Biden are a central element of the impeachment inquiry.
Floridians are split about whether Trump's comments and actions related to Ukraine and investigating Biden are business as usual or something different: 42% said it's typical of what politicians do and 44% said much worse than that of typical politicians, and 14% didn't know or didn't answer the question.
The fine print
The polls were conducted in English and Spanish. Pollsters interviewed 650 Florida voters, who were contacted by landline and cellphones. The survey has a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points. The margin of error for smaller groups, such as men and women or white, black and Hispanic voters, is larger.
The most recent pollster ratings from FiveThirtyEight.com give Siena College an A for its data gathering and accuracy. On Twitter, FiveThirtyEight reported that the next pollster ratings, due out shortly, rate the New York Times Upshot/Sienna poll as best in the country.

2 Plead Guilty To 2016 Hacks And Extortion Of Tech Giants

Texto completo: Guilty pleas to charges of hacking and an extortion conspiracy cap a legal saga that ensnared the tech companies in data breach scandals.
SAN FRANCISCO -- Two men pleaded guilty in federal court in San Jose, Calif., to charges of computer hacking and an extortion conspiracy on Wednesday, capping a thorny legal saga that ensnared tech companies like Uber and LinkedIn in data breach scandals.
The resolution of the case comes as Americans grapple with theft and misuse of their personal information amid serious data breaches at companies from Facebook and Equifax to Target and Marriott over the past decade.
Lynda.com, which is owned by LinkedIn, disclosed to its users in December 2016 that it had a data breach. Officials said some 55,000 accounts were affected, and the company warned another 9.5 million customers about the breach.
The Uber breach affected more than 57 million people, as the hackers gained access to the names, phone numbers and email addresses of riders and drivers who used the service.
On Wednesday, Brandon Glover, a 26-year-old Florida resident, and Vasile Mereacre, a 23-year-old Canadian national, appeared before Judge Lucy Koh of the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. In their plea agreements, the men said that they gained access in 2016 to the private databases of Uber and Lynda.com.
They said they were able to enter by using the credentials of the Amazon Web Services accounts belonging to Uber and Lynda.com employees, and then gain access to the Amazon servers that stored data for those companies. The men said that they then downloaded private customer information, anonymously contacted security officials at the companies and tried to extort them for hundreds of thousands of dollars in bitcoin.
In 2016, Mr. Glover and Mr. Mereacre, using pseudonyms and untraceable accounts, contacted security officials at Lynda.com and asked for payment in exchange for the data. Instead, Lynda.com security officials disclosed the leak to customers; the hackers stopped communicating with the company.
Uber took a different approach. According to court filings, the hackers anonymously contacted Uber's security team in November 2016 and said they had downloaded the account information for 57 million Uber customers. The hackers demanded a six-figure payout to delete the data.
Uber officials tried to reach a deal with the hackers by paying them through a "bug bounty" website, according to court filings. Technology companies commonly pay bounties to scrupulous hackers to find security vulnerabilities in their systems. But in this case, Uber sent Mr. Glover and Mr. Mereacre two payments of $ 50,000 in bitcoin and asked them to sign nondisclosure agreements.
"Companies like Uber are the caretakers, not the owners, of customers' personal information," David L. Anderson, United States attorney for the Northern District of California, said in a statement.
All 50 states and United States territories have enacted laws that require companies to immediately notify customers of unauthorized data breaches that compromise users' personal information.
"Don't be so concerned with your image or reputation," Mr. Anderson said of companies that might try to keep data breaches secret. "Be concerned with the real losses others have suffered. Report the intrusion promptly. Cooperate with law enforcement."
Uber executives revealed the data breach in late 2017. The ride-hailing company ousted Joe Sullivan, the chief security officer who presided over the payments, for arranging the deal and not alerting the public. Uber later settled a nationwide investigation of the breach and the company's behavior surrounding the incident for $ 148 million.
Mr. Sullivan and Travis Kalanick, Uber's former chief executive who oversaw the payments, claimed at the time that the security team treated the incident like an authorized disclosure as part of Uber's "bug bounty" program. Uber's security team used data uncovered during the payment negotiation to find Mr. Glover at his home in Florida, according to the filings.
In January 2017, members of Uber's security team showed up in Florida and Canada to find both men and make them sign confidentiality agreements.
"In order to take on those people on the front lines of the cyber security battle, we rely heavily on our valued relationships and open dialogue with private sector companies in cyber industries," said John Bennett, Federal Bureau of Investigation special agent in charge, who worked on the case. "Their willingness to speedily report intrusions to our investigators allows us to find and arrest those who commit data breaches."
Cleaning up the security breach was one in a string of scandals for Uber in 2017, a year that saw multiple investigations into the company's culture, as well as Department of Justice inquiries into "Greyball," a software tool used to evade transportation authorities. Uber has since pledged to turn over a new leaf and hired swaths of lawyers and compliance officers to clean up its act.
"We appreciate the ongoing work by the U.S. Attorney's office to pursue and bring to justice those responsible for the 2016 breach of Lynda user information," a LinkedIn spokesperson said in a statement. "We're glad to see the resolution of this investigation."
A representative for Uber declined to comment on the plea agreements.
Mr. Glover and Mr. Mereacre could each face a maximum of five years in federal prison and a fine of up to $ 250,000 upon sentencing, which will occur in 2020.

Texto completo: The company's financial performance is a regular bright spot for the social giant, which has been embroiled in scandals in recent years.
SAN FRANCISCO -- Facebook has been targeted by lawmakers over its treatment of political ads and has been misused by Russians to spread disinformation. But on Wednesday, the social network showed those challenges had little effect on its business.
The Silicon Valley company said its revenue in the third quarter rose 29 percent from a year earlier, to $ 17.7 billion, while profits jumped 19 percent to $ 6.1 billion. The results surpassed Wall Street estimates.
Facebook also reported 2.8 billion regular users across its family of apps -- which includes Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and Facebook's core social network -- up from the year previous. More than 1.6 billion people visit Facebook on a daily basis.
Shares in the company rose about 5 percent in after-hours trading.
Facebook's financial performance is a regular bright spot for the social giant, which has been embroiled in scandals in recent years over the way it handles customer data and the spread of misinformation. Regulators and lawmakers are now examining Facebook's power and whether it is stifling competition. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat running for the presidential nomination, has proposed breaking up the company.
The quarterly report is also a brief distraction from the company's current controversy involving the way it handles political advertising across the service. For weeks, the company has been criticized for a recent decision to not require that ads bought by political candidates be fact-checked for accuracy. Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's founder and chief executive, has defended the policy, arguing that Facebook doesn't wish to be the arbiter of free speech across the platform.
"People having the power to express themselves at scale is a new kind of force in the world -- a Fifth Estate alongside the other power structures of society," Mr. Zuckerberg said in an address delivered to Georgetown students this month.
Facebook has taken significant criticism for the policy on political ads. Internally, employees dissatisfied with the decision wrote an open letter to company executives this week, imploring them to consider revising the decision.
And on Wednesday, Twitter escalated the issue by barring all political advertising from its platform entirely. "Paying to increase the reach of political speech has significant ramifications that today's democratic infrastructure may not be prepared to handle," Jack Dorsey, Twitter's chief executive, tweeted Wednesday afternoon. "It's worth stepping back in order to address."
Instead of wavering, Mr. Zuckerberg reaffirmed the company's position on Wednesday.
"From a business perspective, it might be easier for us to choose a different path than the one we're taking," he said on a conference call with investors. "But in a democracy, I don't think it's right for private companies to censor politicians, or the news."
He pushed back on the notion that Facebook chose the policy to support a given political party. And he shot down the idea that Facebook continued to serve the ads out of purely financial motivations. Facebook expects political advertising will contribute less than 0.5 percent of revenue next year, Mr. Zuckerberg said, the first time he has ever cited such a statistic.
"I could be wrong, but my experience running this company so far has been that if we do what we believe is right, even when it's unpopular for years at a time -- then eventually it has worked out best for our community," Mr. Zuckerberg said.
After the 2016 election and a string of scandals that plagued the company, Facebook saw its revenue growth begin to slow, spooking investors and slicing the company's market value. But Facebook's business has mostly kept chugging along. People continued to use the company's products, and recruiting new employees continues to surge; more than 43,000 people are employed by Facebook. The company expects that employee-related expenses will surge into 2020 to help handle security and regulatory issues.
Although the business continues to grow, David Wehner, Facebook's chief financial officer, warned analysts on Wednesday that Facebook's days of blockbuster revenue growth might be slowing. Mr. Wehner said that increased regulatory scrutiny and an emphasis on user privacy might limit Facebook's ad-targeting tools, and therefore the company's ability to add to its revenue as rapidly.
Mr. Zuckerberg also announced that Sue Desmond-Hellmann, chief executive of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, would step down from Facebook's board of directors. Ms. Desmond-Hellmann cited the increasing demands of her work and family life, as well as taking care of her health.

IS leader's death happened in spite of Trump Sun Sentinel Editorial

Texto completo: President Trump took several graceless victory laps Sunday for a success that he nearly undermined.
According to multiple news reports, the CIA last summer had obtained information about the possible location of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, leader of the Islamic State. Officials identified a village in northwest Syria and began planning a raid to capture or kill one of the most wanted terrorists in the world.
But on Oct. 6, without any heads-up to the Pentagon or CIA, Trump ordered a withdrawal of American troops in Syria. Pentagon officials worried that the withdrawal would make it harder to monitor al-Baghdadi, so they moved up the timetable for the raid, likely increasing the risk.
In addition, Kurdish allies whom Trump abandoned provided critical information about al-Baghdadi. Though Trump had made the hunt for this terrorist a priority, a New York Times report said the raid "occurred largely in spite of, and not because of, Mr. Trump's actions."
Council on Foreign Affairs President Richard Haass was more specific. In a tweet, Haass said, "The irony of the successful operation is that it could not have happened without U.S. forces on the ground that have been pulled out, help from Syrian Kurds who have been betrayed, and support of a U.S. intelligence community that has so often been disparaged."
Al-Baghdadi detonated an explosive vest as Delta Force commandos closed in. His death is a significant - if not conclusive - event in the fight against the Islamic State. That also was the case with Al-Qaeda after the raid that killed Osama bin Laden in 2011.
When President Obama announced bin Laden's death, his remarks came with little buildup just before midnight on a Sunday. He gave few details about the operation, took no questions, did not tout his role in approving the raid and ended after about nine minutes by remembering the victims of 9/ 11 and praising the United States.
Trump, however, made the announcement all about him. He tweeted a preview late Saturday night: "Something very big has just happened!" He delayed his appearance until Sunday morning, preempting the news shows that otherwise might have been discussing impeachment.
The president spoke for nearly an hour, including exchanges with reporters. He said al-Baghdadi had died "whimpering, screaming and crying." Continuing his obsession with Obama, Trump bragged that al-Baghdadi's demise was a much bigger deal than bin Laden's.
At such a moment, self-promotion was undignified. But there was more.
Trump practically dismissed the role of the Kurds, who have criticized him for leaving Syria and abandoning them to a Turkish military incursion that began three days later. The Kurds have been America's proxy against the Islamic State. Trump thanked them for "certain support." But also said, "We didn't need very much help."
American intelligence officials contradicted Trump. They considered the Kurds' assistance essential to tracking the ISIS leader.
As an example, Kurdish spies watched the villa where they believed al-Baghdadi was hiding. A Kurdish commander told The New York Times that those spies stole a pair of al-Baghdadi's underwear to obtain a blood sample. DNA testing confirmed the identity.
Having downplayed the Kurds, Trump falsely elevated himself. The president claimed that in his pre-9/11 book "The America We Deserve," he said of bin Laden, "You have to kill him. You have to take him out."
Associated Press fact checkers examined that claim. They found that the book "makes a passing mention of bin Laden but did no more than point to the Al-Qaeda leader as one of many threats to U.S. security. Nor does he say in the book that bin Laden should have been killed."
To further puff himself, Trump said of the terrorists: "They're very technically brilliant. You know, they use the Internet better than almost anybody in the world, perhaps other than Donald Trump."
As Obama noted eight years ago, the death of bin Laden did not end the threat from Al-Qaeda. Nor does the death of al-Baghdadi end the threat from the Islamic State.
Al-Baghdadi already had named a successor - Abdullah Qardash. Estimates are that between 10,000 and 18,000 Islamic State fighters remain, though the campaign that Obama began and Trump continued has taken away all the territory in Iraq and Syria that the group once claimed as its "caliphate."
Trump vowed that the United States would continue to hunt down terrorists. His policies, though, will make that mission harder.
Syria and Russia control the airspace over the area where al-Baghdadi hid out. On the ground, no one is in charge. Such areas breed stateless terrorism. That's why national security experts criticized Trump's withdrawal from what had been a stable part of Syria, from which America could monitor the region.
Had the al-Baghdadi raid failed, Trump surely would have accepted no blame. Fortunately, those in charge performed better than the man who claimed credit.

WHY IS YOUR LANDLINE PHONE NOT WORKING?

Texto completo: Our fancy new internet-based home or office phones are the communication tool of the future cheap, efficient and versatile.
They're also, in a power outage, about as useful as a brick.
All over the Bay Area, residents who rely on these digital landline phones are feeling angry and betrayed during PG&E's shutdown, unable to get even a simple dial tone.
Those with old analog phones on quaint copper lines are, in general, doing just fine.
But the growing number of consumers with new digital Voice over IP (VOIP) systems, which use the internet to make calls, are finding them maddeningly unreliable.
No power means no internet. And no phone. Ironically, the only way to fix your high-tech phone is to buy a low-tech backup power source, like a battery or generator.
With no working landline, internet or cell service, Charlotte Gibb, of Lafayette, drove to a high hill Sunday night to get a cell signal and watch a frightening blaze that had erupted on nearby Acalanes Ridge.
"What was terrifying is that no one in our neighborhood would be alerted to evacuate," she said. "All I could do was look for the tell-tale sign of fire a red glow."
In the high-tech Bay Area, the old system dubbed POTS, for "Plain Old Telephone Service" doesn't get much respect.
For consumers, it's expensive. The phone is a relic, stuck into a jack in the wall and cluttering a room. Sure, it gets great reception. But it rarely rings, and even when it does, it's usually the dentist, a robocaller or someone wanting to sell you life insurance.
VOIP, in contrast, is cheap. Plans are flexible, so you can customize and change them over time. It's easy to add new features. The phone service offers video calls and other features.
The VOIP-based phones are supported by fiber networks that use light instead of electricity. This allows for much faster data transmission, broader bandwidth, quicker access to cloud-based services and better support of streaming video.
The traditional landline system is especially unpopular with the telecom industry, because its aging infrastructure is bothersome to keep up. The industry dreams of the day when it is abandoned, and the companies can invest instead in technologies like 5G and fiber optic cables.
The telecom industry also prefers VOIP for financial reasons. It isn't regulated like traditional phones, so there's no obligation to guarantee universal access and fair prices to consumers, according to the nonprofits Electronic Frontier Foundation and The Utility Reform Network.
AT&T, Verizon and other companies are pushing consumers hard to get them to shift away from landline service. In 2012, after Hurricane Sandy destroyed much of the copper infrastructure in western Fire Island, New York, Verizon didn't want to fix the phone lines.
Instead, it proposed replacing them with Voice Link, a substitute that connects to the cellular network, according to The New York Times. In Pennsylvania, Verizon was fined for refusing to repair an elderly couple's copper phone lines.
To persuade consumers to switch, the telecom industry often offers "Triple Play" packages of services, like television with internet and phone, and other incentives.
"They should have to make a point of informing you of this when they talk you into changing," said Candy Promes, who switched to a VOIP phone, then was frustrated when she lost service.
But in emergencies, the traditional system is a robust and fairly bulletproof way to deliver phone calls. No bells, no whistles. They just work.
That's because the lines carry their own power. This power low voltage, posing no risk comes from the company's central office. And that's backed up by a generator.
"When power goes out, those generators are powered by diesel. And there is enough fuel to last several days," said Regina Costa, telecom policy director of TURN. "And they're in locations where it's easy to refill."
Old-fashioned landlines go down only when they're served by a longer line in a rural area that depends on the phone company's remote "terminal." That terminal is supposed to have backup power, but many don't.
That's what is happening in the Santa Cruz Mountains, where customers of Frontier Communications are without service.
"When commercial power is shut off, the remote terminals remain in service until batteries are depleted," said Javier Mendoza of Frontier. "When utility power is restored, disrupted Frontier services should also restore soon after."
In contrast, VOIP phone services that are delivered using internet technology over fiber optic lines require commercial power to operate. You need to plug in your modem, router or other hardware for it to work.
There's nothing wrong with the VOIP system, said Ernesto Falcon, senior legislative counsel with the Electronic Frontier Foundation.
"The transition is happening," he said. "That's just where the technology is going."
The problem, said Falcon and Costa, is that phone companies aren't required to provide batteries or other backup. This is confusing to consumers; different phones have different batteries, costing from $20 to $35, plus shipping. Batteries age, and fail. Where should these batteries live? In the garage? Near the phone jack? No one knows.
"It is a very dicey situation," Costa said.
On Jan. 1, an old law will expire and the California Public Utilities Commission has the opportunity to mandate power backup, Falcon said.
"It is a matter of public safety," he said. "The old copper phone line has had a long history of these protections. We need the same for the new technologies."

Texto completo: The impeachment inquiry into President Trump over his pressure on Ukraine to conduct an investigation into a political rival, former vice president Joe Biden, is moving rapidly, and developments are coming to light at all hours. Here's a summary of what you might have missed, and what's expected to happen next.
What happened overnight:
■ The New York Times reported that Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman, a current White House national security official, testified in a closed-door hearing Tuesday that he unsuccessfully attempted to restore “crucial words and phrases" to a summary of the call between President Trump and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky.
■ Vindman testified that where a set of ellipses appears in the summary, Trump claimed to Zelensky that there were “tapes" of Biden discussing Ukraine, according to the Times.
■ President Trump is signaling he wants a change in how his allies are defending him in the impeachment inquiry. Republicans have primarily been attacking the closed-door hearings led by House Democrats, but Trump urged them via tweet Wednesday morning to “Go with substance and close it out!"
■ The House released the text of the resolution it will vote on to “affirm" the impeachment inquiry. Read it here.
What's expected to happen next:
■ Acting assistant secretary for International Security Affairs Kathryn Wheelbarger is scheduled to testify at 9:30 a.m. Wednesday.
■ The House vote to “affirm" the impeachment inquiry and set rules for which hearings and documents will be made public will be held Thursday. The vote will mark the first time since the formal inquiry began that House members will be forced to go on record over whether they are in support of it.
■ The National Security Council's senior director for Russian affairs, Timothy Morrison, is scheduled to testify Thursday. Morrison is repeatedly referenced in the explosive opening statement from the State Department's top diplomat in Ukraine, Bill Taylor.

Texto completo: Prominent right-wing media commentators have sought for weeks to cast aspersions on the House impeachment inquiry into President Trump, echoing the president's repeated cries of "witch hunt!" and framing the investigation as motivated by political bias.
Now some of those commentators have opened a new front: questioning the patriotism of Lt. Col. Alexander S. Vindman, the White House national security official and decorated Iraq war veteran who was testifying on Tuesday that he had heard Mr. Trump ask Ukraine to investigate his Democratic political rival.
One pundit on Fox News went as far as to suggest that Colonel Vindman had engaged in "espionage" against the United States, prompting an unusual rebuke from a Republican member of Congress.
Colonel Vindman, who received a Purple Heart after he was wounded in Iraq, is a Ukrainian-American immigrant who was 3 years old when his family fled to the United States. On her Fox News program on Monday, the conservative host Laura Ingraham sought to turn his ethnic background against him, noting that Ukrainian officials had recently sought the colonel's advice about interacting with Mr. Trump's personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani.
"Here we have a U.S. national security official who is advising Ukraine while working inside the White House, apparently against the president's interest," Ms. Ingraham said. "Isn't that kind of an interesting angle on this story?"
Her guest, John Yoo, a former top lawyer in the George W. Bush administration, agreed. "I find that astounding," Mr. Yoo said. "Some people might call that espionage."
The accusation by Mr. Yoo was decried by left-leaning pundits and, on Tuesday, by Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming, a Republican lawmaker. "It is shameful to question their patriotism, their love of this country," Ms. Cheney said, calling on critics to stop questioning the colonel's loyalties.
Still, the notion that Colonel Vindman has some allegiance to a foreign country rapidly spread in right-wing circles, who apparently sensed a useful talking point to undermine testimony that is expected to be deeply damaging to Mr. Trump.
On Tuesday, the president repeatedly described Colonel Vindman as a "Never Trumper" in a series of posts on Twitter. Mr. Giuliani chimed in, too, writing in a tweet that the colonel "has reportedly been advising two gov's." He added: "No wonder he is confused and feels pressure."
On CNN's "New Day," Sean Duffy -- a former Republican representative from Wisconsin and now a pro-Trump pundit -- declared: "It seems very clear that he is incredibly concerned about Ukrainian defense. I don't know that he's concerned about American policy."
"We all have an affinity to our homeland where we came from," Mr. Duffy added. "Like me, I'm sure that Vindman has the same affinity."
His interviewer, the CNN anchor John Berman, pushed back. "Are you suggesting that you would put Irish defense over U.S. defense? Is that what you're saying?" he asked, referring to Mr. Duffy's Irish heritage.
"He has an affinity, I think, for the Ukraine," Mr. Duffy said. "He speaks Ukrainian, and he came from the country and he wants to make sure they're safe and free."
Colonel Vindman, 44, grew up in Brooklyn, completed basic training in 1999, and carried out numerous overseas tours in the Army, including in South Korea, Germany and Iraq. In 2003, he was wounded by a roadside bomb and received a Purple Heart. He has served in multiple United States embassies and joined the National Security Council in 2018.
But online, the conspiracy theory about Mr. Vindman as a foreign agent has begun to spread.
On Tuesday morning, Representative Matt Gaetz of Florida, a close Trump ally, tweeted: "Donald Trump is innocent. The deep state is guilty." An account tied to QAnon, the fringe online conspiracy movement, amplified his claim to 160,000 followers on Twitter, and the conspiracy claim was likewise posted to a Facebook QAnon page within the hour.
Jack Posobiec, a well-known figure on the far-right internet, tweeted the falsehood that Mr. Vindman had been advising the Ukrainian government on how to counter Mr. Trump's foreign policy goals. Mr. Posobiec cited The New York Times as his source -- in fact, The Times reported no such thing.
Nevertheless, his tweet was repeated verbatim at least 50 times by over 25 accounts in the same hour, many written in response to mainstream media tweets about news of Mr. Vindman's testimony with no reference back to Mr. Posobiec's original tweet.

Our Capital, Set to a Go-Go Beat

Texto completo: New legislation would cement the sound's rightful place at the center of this gentrifying city's culture.
African drums have been criminalized around the world for centuries. Even as freedom from slavery was on the horizon, the drums were irritating white power structures. In the summer of 1838, a white Presbyterian minister living in Jamaica complained that enslaved people had organized a "ball" and that their "singing and drumming and dancing disturbed the neighborhood," according to an account unearthed by the historian J.R. Kerr-Ritchie in "Rites of August First."
One enslaved man wasn't having it. He told the minister that "he might do what he liked in his own place." He said the minister believed he had the right to complain only because he was white, and the dancers and drummers were black. But the enslaved man vowed that would change when the first of August arrived because the British Parliament had paid a £20 million ransom to free all people enslaved across the empire.
Then, he said, the minister better not "meddle with him or his dance."
This bit of history comes to mind as I think about what is happening in Washington on Wednesday. The District of Columbia City Council will hold a public hearing considering legislation introduced by Councilman Kenyan McDuffie and others to make go-go music the official music of the city.
Go-go is the city's indigenous musical genre, created by Chuck Brown in the 1970s. It is a mix of funk, hip-hop and Afro-Latin beats with an orgiastic explosion of percussion: timbales, cowbells, rototoms and the signature congas.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
In April, residents of luxury apartments in the gentrifying, historically black U Street area complained about the noise from a Metro PCS store that had been known since the 1990s for playing loud go-go music. When the music was turned off in the wake of a threatened lawsuit against T-Mobile, which owns Metro PCS, thousands of residents took to the streets to protest, using the digital battle cry #DontMuteDC to spread their message. More than 80,000 people signed a "Don't Mute DC Go-Go Music and Culture" petition I created with the activist Ronald Moten. John Legere, T-Mobile's chief executive, tweeted, "I've looked into this issue myself and the music should NOT stop in D.C.!"The store turned its music back up.
But the go-go music, culture, community and economy were in a state of emergency even before this particular attempt to silence the music. Washington has been gentrified faster than any other city in the United States. More than 20,000 black Washingtonians were displaced between 2000 and 2013. Music education has been stripped from many schools. The Metropolitan Police Department's "go-go report" of where bands were playing helped criminalize go-go culture. Curfew laws in the 1980s targeted go-go venues but excluded movie theatres and venues for European performance art. The city's Alcoholic Beverage Control Board has been cracking down on go-go club owners since the 1990s.
Yet, go-go survived, serving as an economic engine, a multimillion-dollar industry employing hundreds of Washingtonians and maintaining a musical tradition with roots in West Africa. City officials are now answering the #DontMuteDC call with proposed legislation that acknowledges, celebrates, preserves and protects go-go culture. This initiative could affirm go-go's economic vitality and central place in the culture and history of the nation's capital.
I'm a scholar of go-go and a longtime commentator on gentrification, so it sends my imagination reeling. Could it mean we might hear go-go's distinct conga drumbeats at district airports and train stations? At school graduations, at city ceremonies, at conferences at the convention center? Maybe we will see go-go musicians serving as artists-in-residence at city agencies, libraries, recreation centers.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
It could mean rescuing key go-go archives and creating the kind of music museums you see in cities such as New Orleans and Atlanta. Go-go history and music could be required in schools. I envision a Chuck Brown Endowed Chair in Digital and Cultural Studies, funding doctoral and postdoctoral fellowships dedicated to studying go-go music and culture.
The city should consider the economic benefits of investing in go-go the same way it has invested in say, baseball. In the early 2000s, Nashville branded itself "Music City" and invested in work force training in the music hospitality industry. In just 15 years, the city's music tourism revenues went from $ 3 billion to $ 7 billion. Today one-third of all visitor spending in the state of Tennessee comes from music.
This new legislation could cement go-go's rightfully central place in urban culture and history. It has the potential to invest and integrate native Washingtonians into the changes and economic expansion sweeping across the city in a way we have not seen. Of course the music is just the beginning of what needs to be done to push back on the displacement and cultural erasure steamrollering across Washington and so many other urban centers across the United States that are not far behind. With that in mind, those of us in the Don't Mute DC collective of cultural activists have developed an anti-displacement and arts preservation platform, and we're organizing our neighbors around these issues in advance of the next legislative cycle. But a powerful start is to make sure go-go culture will, as Councilman McDuffie put it, "never be muted in the District of Columbia."
I thought of the 1838 enslaved Jamaican this month when my husband and I hosted our 19th annual Howard University Homecoming celebration at our home in the district. We hired a local go-go band, Persevir, to perform. We tried to prepare our new neighbors by reaching out on local listservs and social media platforms to tell them about the party. We invited them to join us to grab a plate and encouraged them to call us and not the police if they had any problems with the noise. But not 10 minutes after the band concluded its performance, officers paid our house a visit, saying they'd received multiple complaints.
Like the Jamaican before me who rejected the attempts to quiet his music, I was not having it. If Mr. McDuffie's bill becomes law, perhaps the rest of the city won't either.

Just the truth, no facts please

Texto completo: Joe DiGenova probably coined a new expression, “incandescent ignoramus,” to describe one of today’s witless, pop-star politicians. That remarkably compact description befits his legal training and point of view.
One evening earlier this month radio host Howie Carr took a listener’s call. It was also brief and to the point: “Trump is a scumbag.” This scholarly analysis surely reflects another remarkable intellect and, doubtless, decades of study at some prestigious institute of Malted Arts.
It may be a bit unfair to mock this hapless, anonymous, incandescent ignoramus, but it is not unfair to deplore political and media dunces using far more words to deliver no substance, sense, or supporting facts in their unrestrained partisan advocacy.
Joe Biden said that we (Democrats) prefer “… truth to facts …”. That is a snippet without context and fairness demands saying he badly fumbled whatever point he meant to make. That he did not hear himself and immediately correct the mistake is telling for those of us who already have a dim view of his intelligence and integrity.
What we heard was, “We prefer telling you what to believe to giving you facts and letting you decide what is true.”
Incessantly, lately, we read and hear the same in major metropolitan daily papers and major network media outlets: “We won’t clutter your feeble little mind with pesky, disputable and complicated facts; ‘Here is the truth you must believe.’”
Consider these recent examples:
Within 19 minutes of Donald Trump taking the oath of office, the Washington Post published an article admiring the emergence of an effort to impeach him. Books written by Dan Bongino, Alan Dershowitz, and Gregg Jarrett along with reporting by John Solomon and Sarah Carter, and the two-hour You Tube documentary “Ukraine, The Democrats’ Russia” by Glenn Beck scrupulously document the treachery that began in 2015, became widespread abuses within the DNI and the DOJ in 2017, was thoroughly refuted by the Mueller Report in April 2019, and is still defiantly being called the truth by partisans like Nancy Pelosi, Adam Schiff, CNN, MSNBC, the Washington Post, and the New York Times.
You Tube shadow bans the documentary, by the way: You must know the title to find it.
Having wrung the last bit of use from the collusion ruse, Democrats and their media collaborators created a new fiction that, in a July phone call, President Trump pressured Ukraine President Zelensky to “dig up dirt” on Joe and Hunter Biden.
Unexpectedly and unfortunately for them, the president released the transcript of that conversation and the chronology of Schiff’s conspiring with the “whistleblower” has been published. Everyone who cares to know has the facts of what was said and how the ruse was created. But, despite the facts being known, Adam Schiff presented an account of the call as unspeakably offensive as it was fictitious, and Nancy Pelosi humiliated herself by asserting Schiff’s fictional account was the “truth.”
Fox News put out a poll saying that 51% of voters favored impeachment and removal of the president. Later, it was learned that the poll sample included 50% more Democrats and 70% fewer independents than the population. Why FNC would engage in anything so dishonest has not been revealed but nobody can (honestly) conclude that the poll was anything but deliberate, malicious deception.
Thankfully, Fox has not rationalized or denied that deception.
But there is more.
Voters interested in facts, not “truth,” might research what the uber-rich really pay in taxes; how government subsidies and regulation have affected the cost of education, housing and medical care; or, after hearing Ronald Reagan Jr., what practicing Christians actually do believe and how they live their faith.
Anyone who has read this far has long been troubled by and angry at the purveyors of fact free truth and has previously resolved to no longer consume their rubbish. Beyond destroying their credibility, these outlets apparently have no concern for the tsunami of contempt they have created for themselves and all they advocate.
Alarmingly, though, we are daily reminded there remain hordes whose knowledge of facts may be even less than that of Howie’s caller. They hold views ingested as truth, not formed from facts. Being a responsible and informed voter takes time and hard work but, by failing to do it, we risk our fate being determined by incandescent ignoramuses with advanced degrees in Malted Arts.

Texto completo: Las autoridades fronterizas estadounidenses arrestaron el año pasado en la frontera a más niños no acompañados que en cualquier otro periodo registrado , según los datos publicados este martes. Esta cantidad supera incluso la alta cifra de menores que, durante la era Obama , trataban de cruzar a tierra estadounidense sin ningún adulto.
Los agentes migratorios capturaron a un total de 76,020 menores -la mayoría centroamericanos – que viajaban sin sus padres en el año fiscal que terminó en septiembre. De acuerdo a la información de la oficina de Aduanas y Protección Fronteriza (CBP, por sus siglas en inglés), esta cifra supone un aumento de un 52% respecto al año fiscal anterior.

The New York Times informa de que el crecimiento ha sido parecido en México . El gobierno del presidente Andrés Manuel López Obrador, que encrudeció sus medidas migratorias tras las presiones y amenazas de Donald Trump, detuvo a 40,500 inmigrantes menores que se dirigían al norte sin compañía de adulto alguno. La sumas de las detenciones de niños en ambos países asciende a 115,000.
Casi 25 menores que habían puesto rumbo al norte dijeron en entrevistas con The Times conocer a los peligros que enfrentaban con el viaje y que; si los agarraban; podían acabar hacinados en instalaciones sucias de cualquiera de los dos lados de la frontera. Además, no son ajenos a los agresivos intentos de Trump de bloquear la inmigración que llega por la frontera sur. Aún así, decidieron correr el riesgo para escapar de la pobreza, la falta de oportunidades y violencia .

Texto completo: Nov. 10 will bring a triple-bill of current Blue Note artists to the McAninch Arts Center as part of the exclusive Chicago-area engagement of "Blue Note Records 80th Birthday Celebration: The State of Jazz 2019."
Beginning at 6 p.m., Kandace Springs, James Francies and the James Carter Organ Trio will perform a set of their own music before coming together for the finale featuring a classic Blue Note tune.
A free MAC Chat will precede the concert at 5 p.m.
Media support for this event is provided by WDCB 90.9 FM, Chicago’s jazz station.
Nashville singer and pianist Kandace Springs will release her third Blue Note album "The Women Who Raised Me" in early 2020. After her head-turning 2014 self-titled EP (which caught the attention of Prince who raved "Kandace has a voice that could melt snow"), Springs released her Larry Klein produced debut album, "Soul Eyes" in 2016, followed by her "breathtakingly eclectic" (MOJO) 2018 album "Indigo," produced by Karriem Riggins. The Wall Street Journal declared "the soulful pianist and vocalist is self-assured, distinctive and strikingly contemporary" while Rolling Stone said Springs "recalls an era when the boundaries between jazz, soul and pop were more fluid."
The New York Times has called James Francies "a pianist with liquid dynamism in his touch." The Houston-born, New York City-based pianist and composer released his acclaimed debut album "Flight" on Blue Note in 2018. He has played with jazz headliners including Pat Metheny, Chris Potter, Jeff "Tain" Watts, Stefon Harris, Eric Harland and Terrace Martin, and racked up equally impressive credits in hip-hop and R&B from gigs with Lauryn Hill, JosÃ© James, Common, and Nas, to studio time with Chance the Rapper and appearances with The Roots on "The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon."
Detroit saxophonist James Carter’s Blue Note debut, "James Carter Organ Trio: Live From Newport Jazz," comes out Aug. 30, a thrilling live performance of Carter’s imaginative soul jazz reinvention of Django Reinhardt. Hailed as "one of the most charismatic and powerful soloists in jazz," by The New York Times, Carter harbors a command of his instruments that is astonishingly complete, though he only employs that technique in the service of canny ideas, evoking early jazz, jump blues, the avant-garde and other lessons residing inside his vast, scholarly knowledge of the music of the African American experience.
"Blue Note Records 80th Birthday Celebration: The State of Jazz 2019" will begin at 6 p.m. Sunday, Nov. 10, at the McAninch Arts Center, 425 Fawell Blvd. in Glen Ellyn.
Tickets are $55-$65. For an additional $30 per person, attendees may add on VIP Suite Service, a private, preshow cocktail and hors d’oeuvres reception.
For tickets or more information, visit AtTheMAC.org or call (630) 942-4000.

Texto completo: Miranda Lambert has her bandmates to thank for her relationship with husband Brendan Mcloughlin.
In a Q&A with The New York Times, the 35-year-old singer revealed how she met the man she announced she married on Instagram in February.
"I met my husband doing press for the Pistol Annies record, this time last year," Lambert told the outlet. "Our record came out the day after Halloween, and we did 'Good Morning America. ' My husband was doing security there for the show. "
Something about Mcloughlin caught the attention of the other members of the musical trio, Ashley Monroe and Angaleena Presley.
Miranda Lambert jokes with troll who suggested her marriage won't last: 'Sure won't!'

"My girlfriends, the Annies, saw him and knew I might be ready to hang out with someone," said Lambert. "They invited him to our show behind my back. They plucked him for me.
"My security guy Tom, he was in on it too," she continued. "He said to me, 'He’s here. And he’s pretty. ' (Laughs) Now the Pistol Annies have three husbands, two ex-husbands, three children, a stepson and 23 animals. We’ve done a lot in nine years!"
In her wedding announcement earlier this year, Lambert gushed over her new husband.
"I met the love of my life. And we got hitched!" she told followers at the time. "My heart is full. Thank you Brendan Mcloughlin for loving me for. . . . me. #theone"
Months later, in June, Lambert opened up to "Extra" about life with her spouse and her new role as a stepmom.
"My stepson is amazing,” she said. “I’m loving that whole phase, and I’ve raised a million dogs, so I feel like I’ve got that part of my womanly/motherly thing is full, so this is a whole new journey. It’s great. "

The Navy SEALs' crisis of character

Texto completo: The Navy SEAL commando force is the stuff of legend, lionized for the raid that killed Osama bin Laden, rescuing an American sea captain from Somali pirates and fighting to the death in the mountains of Afghanistan in the "Lone Survivor" story.
This summer, however, the commander of this vaunted band of war fighters warned about an ethical and professional crisis in the ranks. "We have a problem," Rear Adm. Collin Green wrote in a letter to the troops. "Some of our subordinate formations have failed to maintain good order and discipline and as a result and for good reason, our (Naval Special Warfare) culture is being questioned."
There was cocaine abuse in a SEAL team based in Virginia. Two SEALs were accused of killing a U.S. soldier in a hazing in North Africa. Another SEAL allegedly raped an American female service member during a drunken party in Iraq.
And then there was the case of Navy SEAL Edward Gallagher.
A combat veteran with the nickname Blade – who said he craved combat and the chance to "kill as many people as possible," according to The New York Times – Gallagher was accused by members of his platoon of battlefield atrocities in Iraq while fighting the Islamic State terrorist group in 2017.
The allegations included shooting Iraqi civilians from a sniper's nest, firing indiscriminately into neighborhoods with a heavy machine gun, and using a custom-made knife to stab a teenage captive to death before posing with the corpse for a photograph.
The Navy was slow to investigate, and the prosecution's case began falling apart even before trial amid concerns about witness intimidation. Gallagher, who had become the darling of right-wing commentators, was acquitted in July on all charges except the one dealing with posing with a dead body.
According to The Times report last week, after Green began worrying about an anti-authority "Gallagher effect" infecting his elite force, an Instagram account belonging to Gallagher and his wife offered T-shirts with the phrase "Gallagher effect" and decried Green and another top leader as "a bunch of morons." Plans were drawn up to force Gallagher out of the SEALs based on new evidence of misconduct after unauthorized weapons, stolen equipment and illegal drugs were found in Gallagher's home and a work locker.
Then President Donald Trump entered the picture.
The commander in chief, who has advocated torture and taken a keen interest in pardoning troops convicted of war crimes, complained in a tweet this month that "we train our boys to be killing machines, then prosecute them when they kill!"
He followed Gallagher's case, even discussing it with senior Navy officials. According to The Times, the Navy was faced with a dilemma: It could kick Gallagher out of the SEALs to help restore good order and discipline, but risk a reversal by Trump that would effectively emasculate SEAL leadership. So no action has been taken. And what Navy leaders most feared has likely come to pass: They've been shown powerless as the Gallagher effect undermines the unit's ethical code that "uncompromising integrity is my standard. My character and honor are steadfast. My word is my bond."
Last week, former Navy SEAL and retired Adm. William McRaven – the highly respected architect of the bin Laden raid – reflected in a column about America's military ethos.
"The Greatest Generation went to war because it believed that we were the good guys," he wrote. "We are the most powerful nation ... because we try to be the good guys."
But with Gallaghers in the ranks and a president in their corner, is the United States still the good guys?

S&amp;P 500 Record Surprises Skeptics Again

Texto completo: Stock Market Record Surprises Skeptics Yet Again
Stocks in the United States climbed to a record on Monday, building on a three-week run that's been fueled by hopes for a trade deal with China and another cut in interest rates that could keep the economy growing.
The trade war between Washington and Beijing continues to be a key concern for investors, who are wary of the toll it is taking on American businesses. The gains Monday came after President Trump talked up the prospects for an interim deal that would provide farmers and companies some relief.
In the weeks since that agreement, what Mr. Trump has referred to as the "Phase One" trade deal, was first outlined on Oct. 11, stocks have edged steadily higher.
"We are looking probably to be ahead of schedule to sign a very big portion of the China deal, we'll call it Phase One but it's a very big portion," he told reporters on Monday.
The S&P 500 ended the day at 3039.42, surpassing its previous high from late July. At that record stocks are now up roughly 21 percent for the year.
The gains have come despite the fact that investors have plenty of other reasons to worry about the damage the trade war is causing. Economic growth has been slowing. Fairly high expectations for next year's earnings are starting to slip, and corporate confidence has fallen sharply.

As a result, the recent highs have been met with little obvious euphoria from Wall Street.
"I still think the upside from here is going to be limited," said Mike Ryan, the Americas chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management. "We think that most of the gains that will be achieved this year have been booked already."
In part, the skepticism of investors like Mr. Ryan is a result of the fact that some kind of trouble always seems to be just around the corner: another unexpected flare-up in Beijing-Washington relations, or the expanding impeachment inquiry of Mr. Trump, to name just two.
In addition, the record masks this reality: After a very strong start to 2019, the S&P 500 is not much higher than the peak it hit in late April, meaning the last six months have been a sideways struggle rather than a triumphant romp higher. That has drained some of the enthusiasm for stocks.
"I don't sense or see the euphoria that you typically see when you have blowout highs in cycles," Joe Amato, chief investment officer of equities and president at the asset manager Neuberger Berman Group.
There have been big potholes in the road, too. The S&P 500 tumbled 7 percent amid a sharp escalation of trade tension in May. It recovered in June and rose to a record in late July before another bout of trade-related turmoil knocked it back in August.
These declines have been a persistent motif for the markets over the last decade, where investors have repeatedly grown concerned about the outlook for growth, only the see the market recover once again.
Since 2009, a string of potential crises that, at times, batted markets around and raised concerns about a recession: Europe's debt crisis in 2010 (and again 2012), a collapse in oil prices in 2014, a panic over China's growth in 2016.
But in each case, investors' worst fears never came to pass.
Each mini-panic was accompanied by a sell-off in stocks, and a rally in bonds, as investors priced in that rising risk that the string of economic growth could come to an end. Then, as they have in recent weeks, those concerns seem abate.
"You price in a recession that almost gets there, but doesn't happen," said Tony Dwyer, chief market strategist at brokerage firm Canaccord Genuity.
The Federal Reserve's decision to start cutting interest rates is a key reason for that, Mr. Dwyer said.
Facing evidence of a budding economic slowdown, the Fed has cut interest rates twice this year. It is expected to do so again on Wednesday.
The central bank has also increased its purchases of Treasury securities in order to ensure low rates in short-term money markets, a development that injects fresh money into financial markets and which observers view as beneficial for stocks.

Top Bush economic adviser leaves GOP over its handling of Trump 'misdeeds'

Texto completo: Greg Mankiw, an influential conservative economist and a former top economic adviser to President George W. Bush, said that he left the Republican Party because it has "become the Party of Trump."
"Too many Republicans in Congress are willing, in the interest of protecting their jobs, to overlook Trump's misdeeds," Mankiw, a Harvard professor, wrote Monday on his blog.
Mankiw said that he would vote in the Democratic presidential primary for a centrist candidate to prevent Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders from getting the nomination.
He added that Warren or Sanders want to "move the country too far in the direction of heavy-handed state control" and therefore if they won the Democratic primary it would push "those in the center and center-right to hold their nose and vote for Trump's reelection."
Mankiw said he may rejoin the party when it returns to "having honorable leaders like Bush, McCain, and Romney."
The macroeconomics professor is known to be an advocate of free markets. He has written two very popular college-level economics textbooks and is frequently published in The New York Times, The Washington Post, and The Wall Street Journal. In addition to being the chairman of Bush's Council of Economic Advisers, Mankiw advised Mitt Romney during his presidential campaigns.

Texto completo: Un funcionario de seguridad nacional de la Casa Blanca dará declarará este martes ante los legisladores que investigan el impeachment a presidente Donald Trump. El alto cargo, un veterano de la guerra de Irak, escuchó la llamada de Trump al presidente ucraniano y advirtió de a su superior que el mandatario estadounidense había solicitado a su homólogo ucraniano algo “perjudicial para los intereses estadounidenses” .
Según adelantó The New York Times, que tuvo acceso a un borrador de la declaración, el teniente coronel Alexander S. Vindman escuchó a Trump pedir al ucraniano Vlodymyr Zelensky que investigara a uno de sus principales rivales políticos .
El veterano, que es el máximo experto en Ucrania que hay en el Consejo de Seguridad Nacional, notificó en dos ocasiones el modo en el que Trump y su círculo más cercano estaba tratando a Ucrania . El documento al que accedió el Times señala que el comportamiento del gobierno carece de lo que Vindman considera “sentido del deber” .
El teniente coronel sera el primer cargo de la Casa Blanca que escuchó la conversación entre Trump y Zelensky el 25 de julio y que testificará ante el equipo encargado de la investigación que puede llevar al presidente a un juicio político. La llamada entre ambos mandatarios es precisamente la razón que llevó a la presidenta de la Cámara Baja, Nancy Pelosi, a anunciar el inicio del proceso contra Trump. Sin embargo, la Casa Blanca había anunciado que no participaría en la consulta .
“Pensé que no era apropiado exigir que un gobierno extranjero investigue a un ciudadano estadounidense y estaba preocupado por las consecuencias [que tendría sobre] el apoyo del gobierno estadounidense a Ucrania”, dice el coronel Vindman en su declaración. En la llamada que escuchó, Trump presionó a Zelensky para que ordenara una investigación a Joe Biden y a su hijo Hunter por los negocios que este último tenía en su país.
“Me di cuenta de que si Ucrania realizaba una investigación sobre los Biden y Burisma, probablemente se interpretaría como una táctica partidista “, continúa explicando el veterano. En su texto, Vindman hace hincapié en que su preocupación era que este país del este de Europa perdiera el apoyo de los partidos republicano y demócrata “que hasta ahora ha mantenido”.
En agosto, publica el Times, a petición de sus superiores en el Consejo de Seguridad Nacional, el coronel redactó un memorando para reiniciar la ayuda de seguridad que EEUU había retenido de Ucrania, pero Trump se negó a firmarlo.

Texto completo: Gorgeous fall weather accompanied tens of thousands of book lovers who descended upon the Capitol grounds and surrounding venues Saturday and Sunday for the 23rd annual Texas Book Festival.
Though John Grisham’s Saturday morning discussion of his new novel, “The Guardians,” was initially hampered by lousy sound (much to the frustration of the sold-out, ticket-purchasing crowd at First Baptist Church), the charming author dove into a discussion with Talmage Boston about the novel.
Noting that “writers steal everything,” Grisham
discussed hunting the daily paper for stories of injustice that he could transform into fiction. His latest novel is based in part on the case of former Clifton High School principal Joe Bryan, who spent 34 years attempting to prove his innocence in the death of his wife. Grisham read stories about the case written by former Texas Monthly executive editor Pamela Coloff that she published in the New York Times Magazine and ProPublica.
Grisham disagreed with the idea that most lawyers are as "hardened and ornery“ as the men and women he writes about. “Most folks are good, decent, fun, nice folks,” he said. “Most lawyers are decent, hardworking people. But nobody wants to read about those people.”
Grisham also said he loves writing in the first person present tense. “It’s so much easier for me,” he said. “It’s the lazy way to write a novel. The problem comes when you need to go from first person to a scene that happened 20 years ago.”
Earlier in the week, Grisham spoke with the Statesman about the Texas Access to Justice Foundation; he also appeared at the foundation’s 35th anniversary gala Oct. 25. The foundation is the largest Texas-based funding source for legal aid.
It’s incredibly important, Grisham said, for young lawyers to take on legal aid cases. “Once you do it a few times, you see the power of a law license,” Grisham said. For example, “sometimes it’s just a matter of a family on the verge of being evicted simply showing up with a lawyer that can get an unscrupulous landlord to back down."
Also on Saturday: Other marquee authors speaking at ticketed events were Malcolm Gladwell, Sean Brock and John Hodgman (musician Lyle Lovett made a surprise appearance during Hodgman’s talk).
Samantha Power, former U.N. ambassador during the Obama administration, spoke about a new memoir, “The Education of an Idealist,” to a packed audience under the C-SPAN 2/Book TV tent in front of the Capitol.
In a wide-ranging talk, Power touched on her early life in Ireland, an unlikely relationship with her Russian counterpart at the U.N., Vitaly Churkin, and what she called the “decimation” of the U.S. diplomatic and scientific corps under President Donald Trump.
Power also condemned Trump’s decision to withdraw troops from northern Syria, calling it a grotesque betrayal of the Kurds in the region, longtime U.S. allies.
Poet and memoirst Saeed Jones, who won the Kirkus Prize for nonfiction Thursday night from Austin-based Kirkus reviews, appeared on two panels: one on writing about mothers, where he read a stirring passage from the award-winning “How We Fight For Our Lives,” and another celebrating the literary legacy of Toni Morrison, who died this year.
In an afternoon discussion, authors Karen Tongson and Andrea Lawlor delighted an audience with a hilarious talk about pop music and queer identity.
“There is something really gay about ’80s music in general,” Tongson said, adding: “George Michael was the crucible. Do I want him, or to be him?”
On Sunday, authors speaking included Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who returned to Austin with her newest picture book, “Just Ask! Be Different, Be Brave, Be You”; Austin writer Stephen Harrigan, who just released a well-received book about Texas history called “Big Wonderful Thing”; and well-known chef Aarón Sánchez talking about his memoir, “Where I Come From: Life Lessons From a Latino Chef.”

Texto completo: "If you look historically, things fell from the sky with a surprising frequency. I don't think things have changed to cause things to fall with less frequency, but things are solved now."
Kurt Gohde
Transylvania University art professor
What would you do if chunks of raw meat rained down from the sky?
Hopefully you wouldn't eat it, but apparently some people did when "a horse wagon full" of hunks fell from the sky on March 3, 1876, covering the yard of a confused farmer's wife in Bath County.
What was described as "flakes" of meat rained down around Mrs. Allen Crouch, who was making soap in her garden at the time.
An article in The New York Times a week later published the account of Harrison Gill, "whose veracity is unquestionable." The article said some pieces were 3-4 inches square, and others stuck to the fences. When the meat first fell, it "appeared to be perfectly fresh."
The two unidentified men who tasted the meat said it was either mutton or venison.
Over the next two days, curious neighbors and scientists flocked to the Crouches' farm to try to determine what had caused the strange phenomenon.
There is no definitive agreement about what happened that day, said Kurt Gohde, an art professor at Transylvania University who has researched the incident. There are, however, plenty of theories.
Gohde's favorite theory is one that he said was presented later in The New York Times that it was "cosmic meat" — flesh of animals from an exploding planet. People were familiar with meteors at the time, but they didn't know that it would've been impossible for the meat to fall through the Earth's atmosphere without being incinerated. So the explanation was certainly plausible to them, no matter how absurd it sounds today.
One scientist who tested the meat said it was tissue from the lungs of a child or goat, which drew a lot of attention, but didn't stick.
One theory that didn't get a lot of attention, Gohde said, was by Robert Peter, a scientist at Transylvania University: vulture vomit.
Peter knew, or at least theorized, that when vultures are startled or need to take off quickly, they may need to lighten their load so they can fly. In such cases, the birds vomit food they've recently eaten, possibly even while flying.
This theory is believed today to be the most likely, though Gohde pointed out it has a big hole: To believe the vulture vomit theory is to disbelieve the account of the only person who saw it happen. Mrs. Crouch said when she looked up, the sky was clear, and if vultures were vomiting enough meat to scatter across a football field, Mrs. Crouch presumably would have seen vultures overhead.
The Kentucky Meat Shower is not a historical event taught in classrooms, but there is a children's book about it, and no, it's not "Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs."
Mick Sullivan, host of "The Past and The Curious," a history podcast for kids, wrote "The Meatshower: The Mostly True Tale of an Odd (and Somewhat Edible) Occurrence" earlier this year. It's written from the perspective of a piece of the meat that fell in Mrs. Crouch's yard and still sits in a jar on a shelf at Transylvania University today. The little chunk just wants answers about what happened, but like us, he may never know.
If something like the meat shower happened today, Gohde said, scientists would dig until they found out exactly what happened. In the 1800s, however, unexplainable things happened all the time, and when scientists couldn't settle on an explanation, they moved on to the next thing.
"If you look historically, things fell from the sky with a surprising frequency," Gohde said. "I don't think things have changed to cause things to fall with less frequency, but things are solved now."
Gohde said he hears about strange things falling from the sky somewhere in the world about once every two years, though it's never raw meat.
If he had to put his money on a theory, Gohde said he would go with the vulture vomit. But he's fine not knowing with certainty.
"I prefer wonder to solutions," he said. "I think there are things we don't understand. ... I prefer the unsolvable."

Tiny parcel of land has complex story

Texto completo: The Delaware River is the official border between the First State and New Jersey, right? Yes and no.
Unbeknownst to many residents, the two states actually share two land borders, one of which is nearly 2 miles long.
Not only does Delaware own a small chunk of Artificial Island, where the Hope Creek Nuclear Power Plant is, but there's a weird swath of land just outside Pennsville, New Jersey, that belongs to the Diamond State.
The entire thing is only about 580 acres, but it and rights to the nearby Delaware River have been the subject of not one, but three U.S. Supreme Court cases, the most recent of which concluded in 2008. Local residents call it "The Point" or "The Baja."
"It's weird, and it has been weird for a long time," Pennsville Mayor Robert McDade said of property's existence. "Most people wouldn't even know that it's out there."
So why is the tiny piece of land such a big deal? And why does it exist in the first place?
The answers to both questions are surprisingly complex.
How was the border established? The answer to the second question, which we'll tackle first, lies with Delaware's northern border, which is curved instead of a straight line.
Its existence dates from a deed to William Penn from the Duke of York on Aug. 24, 1682, which granted Penn all the land west of the Delaware River within a 12-mile compass circle beginning at the courthouse in New Castle.
Unlike other territorial boundaries, however, where rivers are essentially split in half between two states, the deed gave Penn rights to the entire waterway up to the low-tide mark on the east side.
Originally, that also gave Delaware ownership of a marshy wetland just outside Pennsville, which was designated a federally protected bird habitat in the 1930s.
It was called Killcohook National Wildlife Refuge.
But then, in the first part of the 20th century, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers began dredging the river and depositing silt at Killcohoook, eventually turning it into solid land.
Tim Boyle, a spokesman for the Corps, said the process took several decades.
Dredging helps keep the river deep enough for shipping traffic, and during and after World War II preserving nature took second priority to finding an easy place to dump silt and mud, according to The News Journal's archives.
The wetland was transformed into fields of tall plume grass and dusty hills, and Killcohook's status as a refuge was revoked in 1998. Conservationists cried foul and raised concerns about chemicals and pollution from the mounded dredge spoils.
Thousands of geese, mallards, ducks, teal and pheasants were replaced by empty beer bottles and junked cars. On a recent Thursday, the only sound one could hear at The Baja was that of the wind racing through invasive phragmites, a species of reed that crowds out native vegetation.
The New York Times, which wrote about the dredge-spoil dumping in 1985, said the failed wildlife area was perhaps one of New Jersey's "ugliest ecological secrets."
Ownership and management of Killcohook was "a real ball of wax," the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service told the newspaper.
The land is part of Delaware, is owned by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and has been managed as hunting grounds by wildlife agencies in both New Jersey and Delaware.
"It was a bastard within the national wildlife system," an official later told The News Journal in 1998. "It really has been kicked back and forth between its parents."
Today, Boyle said the land isn't used for anything specific. McDade, Pennsville's mayor, said dredge spoils are still routinely dumped there.
The Army Corps of Engineers has since become more environmentally conscious and uses dredge spoils to create or restore wildlife habitats, replenish beaches and more, according to its website.
What were the court cases about? New Jersey has long argued that the small strip of land created by dredging shouldn't be Delaware's in the first place.
There have been three Supreme Court cases between the two states over its ownership and rights to the Delaware River.
The first was resolved in 1905 with a compact between the two states that addressed fishing rights but didn't define the border. The second lawsuit, in 1934, concluded that Deleware owned "the river and the subaqueous soil" up to the low tide mark.
A third case in 2007 was sparked by a liquid natural gas plant.
In 2005, a fight erupted between the two states over British Petroleum's then-proposal to build a $500 million LNG import facility just across the river from Claymont.
Under the plan, New Jersey would have built a delivery pier that jutted into Delaware's territorial waters. While New Jersey saw jobs and economic development, Delawareans feared potential explosions of the condensed fuel.
In 2006, Sen. Harris McDowell, D-Wilmington, co-sponsored a bill, likely in jest, that would have authorized then-Gov. Ruth Ann Miner to send the Delaware National Guard across the river to physically block construction of the port's bulkheads and piers.
New Jersey jokingly threatened to bring the Battleship New Jersey down.
By 2008, the U.S. Supreme Court intervened, ruling that Delaware's laws could, in fact, prevent the plan from progressing.
No man's land While Delaware hasn't ceded the small strip of land outside Pennsville to New Jersey, it has relied on the other state to help maintain order there.
It's a bit of a no man's land, referred to by some local residents as "The Baja," Pennsville police Chief Allen J. Cummings said.
He's not sure what inspired the nickname but said it's been referred to as that since he was a kid.
In the past, New Jersey police had no jurisdiction over the property, which means people would go there to commit crimes, according to a 1990 Baltimore Sun story.
Teens could do drugs and drink there without fear of arrest.
Then, in 1987, Pennsville police found the body of a 45-year-old hunter who had been shot in the head.
The department had to call Delaware coroner's office to pick up the body because no one in New Jersey was authorized to do it.
The man was only 10 feet over the state line, authorities said.
The death, which was eventually ruled a suicide, highlighted jurisdictional issues over the land. Eventually, the two states agreed that the Pennsville Police Department could enforce laws on the property.
That doesn't mean Cummings and his officers patrol The Baja, the police chief said. They only go out there if they get a call about something.
"We've had a few fatalities up there, kids on four-wheelers or motorcycles or dirtbikes," Cummings said.
The mayor said for a time, after word got out that the land was a good place for off-roading, people were coming from nearby states like Pennsylvania with big trailers full of ATVs.
Accesses to the property are blocked off by iron gates, but they can be circumvented by small recreational vehicles, Cummings said. There are fewer off-road vehicles now, thanks to enforcement efforts, but teens likely still use the area to party.
Even so, it's better than it used to be when he was in high school.
He said the department hadn't gotten any calls from the area in a couple of years, though if you walk along the shoreline there are signs of recent bonfires and drinking.
"We don't have to drive up there and check it every night," Cummings said. "It's not like that anymore."
The department also gets calls about human remains found in The Baja. Sometimes, when someone takes their own life by jumping off the Delaware Memorial Bridge, they will wash up on its shores.
Years ago when Cummings was a detective, a child even found a human skull on the beach, which he brought into the police department in a milk crate.
Near the site it was found, police found a pair of pants with a set of car keys in the pocket, which were matched to a vehicle found abandoned near the bridge.
When there are fatalities or human remains are found in the water or the land belonging to Delaware, Pennsville officers call the Delaware State Police Department, which recovers the bodies and heads up any subsequent investigations.
"It's an interesting place," Cummings said. "There's a lot of history there."
Across from Deemers Beach sits a 580-acre piece of land that belongs to the Delaware, even though it's on the New Jersey side of the river.

Texto completo: LARAMIE, Wyo. -- Two books ago, Lee Child's Jack Reacher passed through the southeast corner of Wyoming in his efforts to track down the owner of a pawned West Point ring. The book was "The Midnight Line" and it was unusually transporting for a Reacher thriller. You could visualize the immense flat expanses of old railroad land stretching toward the foothills of the Rockies, the long miles of dirt road down which anyone could disappear under a vast open sky.
Reacher moved on. He always does. But Child and Jane, his wife of 44 years, decided to stay.
Now, with a Reacher TV project in the works and the 24th novel in the series on the way (titled "Blue Moon," it will arrive on Child's 65th birthday, Oct. 29), I am in Laramie to have coffee in a diner with Reacher's creator. As any devotee knows, Reacher spends a lot of time in diners. He downs amounts of coffee that would put most people on life support. He sits with his back to the wall, eats like a trencherman and gets acquainted with the waitress. He wants her to remember him, because it might be handy.
But here in the real world, I'm meeting the reedy, 6-foot-4 Child -- actual name, James Dover Grant -- and not his brawnier, inch-taller hero. Laramie has no real diner. It's got a place that serves cappuccino and arty beer that, Child confirms, Reacher would be "bemused by." Sitting in a booth with his back to the wall, Child faces a rainbow flag; Laramie is where Matthew Shepard was killed for being gay 21 years ago, and this city of 32,000 continues to honor his memory. We're directly across the street from two bookstores. Outside their doors, few people know that a best-selling author has started spending three months of the year nearby.
Child drinks a meager half cup of coffee, claiming to have had a whole pot at home. He insists on paying the check, either out of gallantry or for tax reasons. Then we climb into his distinctly un-Reacher-like electric blue S.U.V. and begin a drive straight out of his novel. He lives 40 or 50 miles from town. The intersection closest to his roost is a 10-minute drive away. That's also where the paved road ends.
The sky is as big as skies get. The high prairie is golden. Miles of dirt road lead upward to an immaculate, rustic house with decks on three sides. Unobstructed views stretch 20 miles into the distance. Child's place is on 35 acres, protected by thousands of acres of forest, lakes and ranch land. It all cost less than he got for the 900-square-foot apartment on 22nd Street where he used to live. If you want to relocate to the middle of nowhere, this is how it's done.
Child, an Englishman, has gone native. He's dressed in boots, jeans, T-shirt and a leather barn coat. He owns two cowboy hats, but didn't wear one for this interview "for fear of making you laugh." He already lived here when he wrote "The Midnight Line," and acknowledges that describing a familiar setting was more satisfying than making one up. Though Wyoming's renown as a tax haven was a factor in his move, he says, the decision had "more to do with an immigrant's sense that there's always somewhere else to explore." (Child and his wife have numerous homes, including one above St. Tropez and a spread in East Sussex, England, that he bought for bragging rights after growing up poor. He still spends time at an apartment he owns on Central Park West, but Jane has decided she's through with New York.)
The Laramie area also happens to abut Colorado, where recreational marijuana is legal. Child made waves when he talked about being a regular user; his habit goes back 50 years. He finds it especially handy for reading his work, claiming the high helps him judge his writing. And he likes doing actors' voices: Tony Curtis, a pretty good Michael Caine.
As we approach the house for lunch, Child proudly points out a few landmarks. The address number is printed in a clean font and hangs from a sturdy post. He did that himself. The generator on the hillside got them through all of last winter. To the right of the driveway sits what Child calls his rockery. Since his hands, unlike Reacher's, aren't the size of small animals, he's dexterous enough to treat this tiny garden lovingly. So does Jane, who has arranged some low, heathery sprigs in a small vase for lunchtime.
Their 39-year-old daughter, Ruth, who studied forensic linguistics and will move to Fort Collins, Colo., later this year, has come by for the occasion. She and her mother have made lunch. "It was supposed to be tuna niçoise, but we all like different things," Jane says; these three are strong willed as well as close-knit. So lunch means a different kind of tuna salad for each of them, and a highly entertaining debate about apostrophe usage. Ruth was only about 7 when she went to a market with her father and asked, "Dad, shouldn't that sign say '10 items or fewer?"'
Jim and Jane, as they're known here, have made local friends. But they're both voracious readers (she is a dedicated environmentalist) and they're mostly home alone. The place is set up for that. Their work areas are far apart, and he has lucked into the best room in the house as his office: double height and mostly glass with a fireplace. It should be the master bedroom. But the noisy furnace room below ruled that out, so here are two desks face to face, one for Reacher projects and the other for correspondence; plus high piles of books for Child's recreational reading; the longest available leather sofa, which still isn't long enough; and a golden trophy shaped like a pen nib, the 2019 British Book Award for author of the year, on the otherwise bare shelves.
(Child will receive another award, the Commander of the British Empire, in February, though his fierce objections to the British class system make him reluctant to bow to the royal family member presenting it. What if that turns out to be the queen? "She is tiny," Child says, "so there'll be a certain amount of craning, which might pass for a bow.")
The study is also where Child is taking on a major new job: the Reacher TV reboot, for Amazon. Earlier this decade, when Paramount made a couple of Reacher movies starring Tom Cruise, Child knew better than to cede full control of his popular character. He sold the rights to two films, with the condition that he'd have to sign off on any others. After Reacher fans complained that Cruise was too small to play the big bruiser, and Cruise coaxed the first film's director, Christopher McQuarrie, to his "Mission: Impossible" franchise, Paramount decided two Reacher films were enough. And along came streaming.
Child settled on Amazon rather than Netflix or any other streaming service in part because of the synergy it allowed. Every time he publishes a book, Amazon delivers a lot of copies. The company is willing to advertise the show on its book packaging, and email a link to Child's readers. So he's begun work on what could be an eight-year project.
The TV Reacher will be large, very large, and in his 30s or 40s. (The lead hasn't been cast yet; an Army boot is waiting for the right Mr. Cinderella.) The series will start where the books did. "Killing Floor," the first Reacher novel, will anchor Season 1, with other books picked over for subplots. Child will supervise the screenplays but not write them, and will help reinvent Reacher from the ground up. Or Reachers, plural. The one in "Blue Moon" is older, hipper, richer and hotter than previous incarnations. He doesn't wear Army surplus. He likes black. He knows about performance art. And he gets into a sustained sexual relationship as well as a vicious gang war between Ukrainians and Albanians.
"I wanted him completely out of his comfort zone," Child says. "He's capable of getting comfortable pretty quick."
From the looks of it, so is his maker.

Texto completo: Un arresto en el verano fue crucial para conseguir la baja de Abu Bakr al Bagdadi, el líder de ISIS, este fin de semana.
De acuerdo con el New York Times, el plan para emboscar a Al Bagdadi comenzó en el verano cuando la CIA consiguió información sobre la ubicación del líder del supuesto califato gracias al arresto de una de sus esposas y un mensajero.
Relacionado: Trump cree que baja del líder de ISIS es mucho más grande que la de Osama Bin Laden
El interrogatorio a la mujer, que era de toda la confianza de Al Bagdadi, llevó a la CIA a unir fuerzas con iraquíes y kurdos para conseguir la ubicación específica. El Times asegura que los kurdos siguieron brindado información a Estados Unidos , sin importar que el presidente Donald Trump hubiera retirado a las tropas del norte de Siria para permitir una incursión turca.
Una fuente kurda dijo a EFE que habían estado coordinándose durante estos últimos meses con Washington, a quien agradeció su papel, pero el secretario de Defensa de Estados Unidos, Mark Esper , subrayó que la información acerca de la ubicación precisa de Al Bagdadi fue aportada por Turquía 48 horas antes de la misión.
Durante ella, los comandos estadounidenses atravesaron espacio aéreo ruso, por lo que Moscú fue avisado, y también le dio las gracias junto a Damasco .
Relacionado: Trump confirma que líder de ISIS murió en operativo en Siria: “Murió como un cobarde”
Idlib es el último feudo insurrecto en Siria en el que se han concentrado una miríada de grupos extremistas y que habían dado una vía a Al Bagdadi para refugiarse, entre los que destaca la facción Hurras al Din (Guardianes de la Religión), la imagen de la red extremista Al Qaeda en Siria.
Es el Organismo de Liberación del Levante , una alianza islamista en la que está incluida la exfilial siria de Al Qaeda, la que controla prácticamente todo Idlib, considerada “terrorista” por Damasco y Moscú, que desarrollan desde el 30 de abril una ofensiva contra ellos.

Texto completo: Pity the poor word "whistleblower." Like the intrepid human it denotes, this term has endured a long, difficult struggle toward legitimacy and respectability.
Its parents, "blow" and "whistle," have been sounding the alarm since Shakespeare's time. Lady Macbeth fretted that the "sightless couriers of the air shall blow the horrid deed in every eye," while the clown in "The Winter's Tale" faulted indiscreet maids for choosing to "whistle off these secrets ... tittle-tattling before all our guests."
"Whistle" and "blower" have been used as a phrase for centuries, of course. The earliest citation I could find of the pairing came in the Janesville (Wisc.) Gazette, which, in 1883, praised a policeman named McGinley for blowing his whistle to disperse a riot: "Ere the town clock had struck the midnight hour, all had returned to their homes. But the crowd of people were all willing to bet that McGinley was the champion whistle blower in America."
In subsequent decades, the term was applied regularly to the law enforcement officers and sports referees who alerted people to felonies and fouls. Perps and players, of course, didn't always appreciate these shrill alarmists - "Damn whistle blowers!" - so the phrase inevitably acquired a negative connotation.
"Whistle blower" spiked in both popularity and reputation during the late 1960s and early 1970s when journalists started using it figuratively to describe brave souls who came forward to expose governmental and corporate malfeasance. Think Daniel Ellsberg, Deep Throat, Ralph Nader and Erin Brockovich, though, as far as we know, none of them actually blew whistles.
By the late 1960s, the two-word phrase was common enough to be joined with a hyphen. In 1969, for instance, the Lawton (Okla.) Constitution wrote of the GI who exposed the My Lai massacre, "This whistle-blower has turned out to be a clever member of the anti-war faction." And in 1970, the New York Times described "how well the majority leader handled a whistle-blower."
The term had become so popular by the late 1970s that publications and dictionaries began dropping the hyphen and rendering the term as one word. Since then, "whistleblower" has been used to describe anyone who alerts the public or those in authority to wrongdoing.
Whether you love whistleblowers or hate 'em, you're probably asking the same question I am: Whatever happened to McGinley?

WHY ARE THESE GIRLS SO MEAN? 'MEAN GIRLS' MUSICAL, PUBLIC'S 'SCHOOL GIRLS' BOTH AIM TO DETHRONE TEENAGE QUEEN BEES

Texto completo: It's mean season in Pittsburgh.
"Mean Girls," the musical based on Tina Fey's 2004 hit movie, heads into the Benedum Center Tuesday, and its spinoff, "School Girls, or the African Mean Girls Play," gets its regional debut courtesy of Pittsburgh Public Theater, starting Nov. 7.
The related works miss each other by four days - a coincidence of scheduling, but not, necessarily, of timing.
"Ways to deal with meanness and bullying are perhaps in the air," said Nell Benjamin, the lyricist for "Mean Girls."
There are obvious differences between the two works, but the main point is, rival teenage girls behaving badly toward each other, and how much better it would be for everyone if they all would just get along.
In "Mean Girls," Regina George is the quintessential queen bee of the high school cafeteria set. In "School Girls," it's Paulina who rules the roost. Both are certain that each will soon be wearing a crown - Regina as homecoming queen and Paulina as a Miss Ghana contestant. And both the musical and Jocelyn Bioh's play feature newcomers who throw wrenches into those plans - Cady arriving in Evanston, Ill., after 12 years in Africa, and Ericka coming to Ghana's Aburi Girls Boarding School for her last year of high school after being raised in Ohio.
Fey's story harnessed the essence of Rosalind Wiseman's 2002 bestselling self-help book, "Queen Bees and Wannabes: Helping Your Daughter Survive Cliques, Gossip, Boyfriends, and Other Realities of Adolescence" while relying on her own high school experiences to write the movie. She translated the Tony-nominated "Mean Girls" to the stage with her husband, composer Jeff Richmond, director Casey Nicholaw ("The Book of Mormon") and Benjamin.
As the lyricist for "Legally Blonde," Benjamin would seem to be a natural to mine the depths of the "Mean Girls" characters. She also has a master's degree in women's studies.
"Tina, who is amazing about putting women forward for jobs, was looking for another female on the team, so they met with me, and I tried very hard to be coherent in the presence of my idols," Benjamin said by phone last week.
Fey further cemented her "idol" status with a speech she gave at Variety's 2018 Power of Women luncheon, "a speech that I still am in awe of," Benjamin said, adding, "Tina walks the walk that she talks in 'Mean Girls.' " That is to say, she rejects the "meanness myth" and is a proponent of lifting up other women.
Fey, who became the first female head writer for "Saturday Night Live," said in her speech, "I made a vow to myself to not accept that privilege of being the only woman in the room ... to use any power I had to create opportunity for others."
In preparing "Mean Girls" to go on tour, Benjamin and the creative team did some tinkering.
"That sort of myth about women always being mean to each other and always tearing each other down, we got to explore it even more because even when the movie came out, there was this sense of why are girls so mean to each other? And it was more like a given," she said.
Benjamin pointed to the song "I'd Rather Be Me" that advances the theory that girls are told, from a very young age, not to outwardly express anger or aggression. As a result, they find destructive ways to channel those feelings.
The song is based on both "Queen Bees and Wannabes" and works by author Rachel Simmons, who in "Odd Girl Out" writes that boys can get away with things that girls are chastised for saying.
Markia Nicole Smith, who plays queen bee Paulina in the Public's production of "School Girls," is a graduate of Point Park University. She attended the Baltimore School for the Arts, so the "cliques" in her high school were divided by disciplines, rather than social standing.
Still, she gets the point.
"I feel like women throughout history have been pitted against each other. I feel like it is ingrained in us," she said. "The only way to change it is to be conscious of when you're competing, is it just because it's another woman, or finding out what the root of the competition is, and if it's necessary."
Roots of meanness
For evolutionary theorists,"the mean" can be traced to the survival of the fittest. For example, in a 2013 article for The Royal Society, Tracy Vaill wrote, "The study of sexual selection among human females has primarily focused on two competition strategies used to attract mates: self-promotion and the derogation of rivals."
Before spending time with Regina, Cady just wants to fit in. Ericka, however, poses an immediate threat to Paulina's dominance, as Jesse Green described in his New York Times review of "School Girls." Besides her firsthand knowledge of America, Ericka "also appears to possess naturally the traits Paulina only pretends to: kindness, sophistication and - crucially, cruelly - creamy light skin."
"School Girls" takes certain beats from "Mean Girls," but stereotypical standards of beauty and colorism - discrimination based on dark skin tones - are front and center, as the girls vie for a place in the 1985 Miss Ghana pageant. Playwright Bioh told Playbill.com that, amid the cliques and gossip and competition, most important to her was an explicit representation of the colorism she has experienced as a dark-skinned woman.
Smith recalled her own experience, when she was wearing a bright pink top and a light-skinned girl told her she should not wear that color with her dark skin. So deeply did the remark become embedded in her psyche, that for several years thereafter, Smith's wardrobe was predominantly black.
"When we are looking at the standards of beauty, when the show takes place, in 1986, it's all like tall, thin women who are fair-skinned, so that is what you try to aspire to," she said of Paulina and her schoolmates.
What Bioh's play shares with Fey's is a mirror effect that may lead to some soul-searching.
"I think most women have a little Paulina in them," Smith said. "Even if they don't express it, we all project those thoughts sometimes. If anything, playing Paulina has helped me reflect, am I projecting things onto my friends?"
Sitting in the bustling O'Reilly Theater she also reflects on the fact that she is in her first professional role since leaving college, with an all-female, all-black cast.
The fact that Pittsburgh theaters present such opportunities is not lost on Smith. She was walking in front of the theater, with castmate and Point Park grad Atiauna Grant the other day, and the pair stopped to stare in wonder.
"It was like, we saw shows here, we came to see 'Guys and Dolls' here, and now we are in this theater and we get to tell a really important story in the city where we were taught," Smith said. "It's totally full circle, and it's really beautiful."
For Benjamin, daughter Persephone, who turns 7 on Sunday, has heightened her awareness about the lessons of "Mean Girls." She took her to the Broadway opening and admits that might seem inappropriate for one so young. But, said the writer of some mean lyrics, "even though some of the stuff is mature, the great thing about the musical is, every message in it, I want her to have."

Texto completo: Two interesting things have been happening in the world of film over the last month. A relatively low-budget, no-special effects movie that places Batman's Joker in a version of Martin Scorsese's decaying 1970s-era New York City has become one of the most successful American movies of the year -- with clouds of political outrage trailing in its wake. And everyone on the internet is yelling at, about, or in defense of Scorsese himself, because the aging director told an interviewer that superhero movies aren't real cinema.
We often talk about unexpected political controversies in terms of their relationship to an established order, an existing regime. The same can be true in the aesthetic and commercial spheres: The success of "Joker" and the outrage around Scorsese are both disturbances that matter because of their relationship to the existing Hollywood order, the current pop-cultural regime.
That order is built, to an extent that would have been unfathomable even 20 years ago, on the commercial exploitation of what was once called "genre" entertainment -- the comic-book movie especially, the Marvel empire above all, with a wider range of science fiction and fantasy blockbusters and sequelae around that superhero core.
This is not just a normal sort of cultural cycling, akin to the way Westerns ruled the '50s or pumped-up action stars the '80s. The sheer scale of genre dominance is unique, as Mark Harris wrote for Grantland in an era-distilling 2014 essay: These franchises "are not a big part of the movie business. They are not the biggest part of the movie business. They are the movie business. Period."
Strikingly, this regime is a marvel of corporate capitalism, a machine for global moneymaking -- superheroes work for worldwide audiences in ways that no other entertainment can match -- that is also intensely defended by people who think of themselves as rebels, outsiders, weirdos, freaks. The Western in its Ford-Wayne heyday knew itself to be mainstream and middlebrow, but even in its gazillion-dollar apotheosis the world of "genre" still maintains a fan base that imagines itself eccentric and disrespected and oppressed.
This nurtured sense of grievance explains the online anger every time somebody like Scorsese dares to doubt the aesthetic merits of the new regime. And it may be a strength of the superhero order, a source of resilience, that so many of its fans continue to answer Andrew O'Hehir's 2012 question, "at what point is the triumph of comic-book culture sufficient?", with a zealot's absolutism: Not until the last film snob shuts up; not until Scorsese breaks down and makes a Batman sequel.
But maybe that zeal hides an uneasy conscience, a buried knowledge that while "genre" cinema can be as great as any other form -- I'm counting down the days to the new Dune adaptation -- its complete commercial takeover has been obviously bad for popular culture and pop art.
The superhero regime has wasted far too much talent on stories that are fundamentally unworthy of the actors and directors making them. It has empowered and interacted with corporate consolidation, including the devouring power of a Disney empire that is now literally disappearing classic movies from the theater circuit into its corporate vault. And it has habituated adult audiences to stories that belong -- with, yes, exceptions -- to the state of arrested development in which far more of Western culture than just Hollywood is trapped.
I say "arrested development" because a common critique of these movies is that they are childish or "infantilizing," to quote Bilge Ebiri's fine Vulture essay on the Scorsese contretemps. But that seems not quite apt: Children and their stories are much stranger and more interesting than the superhero industry, which sells a mix of grandiosity, moral certainty and performance anxiety (in the endless origin stories, especially) that belongs essentially to early adolescence.
And this is where the success of the Joaquin Phoenix "Joker" becomes especially interesting. My initial take on the movie was hostile, because I don't think "Joker" is really about any of the things -- inceldom, liberalism, late capitalism -- that its admirers and enemies have read into its story. Instead it's a competent Scorsese simulacrum whose success exposes both the frustrated desire for movies that are more politically and morally adult ... and the tragedy of a movie system that can only simulate grown-up art inside the comic-book machine.
But a more sympathetic reading might say that the character of Arthur Fleck, the Joker-to-be in the movie, is a kind of Dorian Gray's picture for the entire comic-book universe: A damaged man-child with pre-sexual romantic attachments and fantasies of secret lineages and untapped greatness, whose destructive arc is far closer to what perpetual adolescence really looks like than the sexless godhood of the Marvel heroes or the eternal school days of Hogwarts.
In which case its audiences aren't just getting an imitation of the better movies that the age of genre has displaced. They're experiencing a work that is genuinely subversive -- maybe not of progressivism or neoliberalism, but at least of the all-conquering, imagination-shrinking cultural juggernaut to which "Joker" ostensibly belongs.

ESSENTIAL CALIFORNIA; Owning up to the state's original sin; Nearly 160 years after a massacre, tribe gets island back

Texto completo: California is in a moment of long-overdue reckoning with the state's original sin: the blood-soaked treatment of the people who inhabited this land long before any white settlers ever dreamed of Manifest Destiny.
In recent months, we've seen Gov. Gavin Newsom issue a formal apology that refused to mince words ("It's called a genocide. That's what it was," the governor said), along with a rethinking of the symbolism of mission bells.
Last Monday, history was made in a packed rec center on the waterfront in Eureka, when the city signed a deed effectively returning Indian Island to the Wiyot people.

On the rugged North Coast of California, there is a cluster of islands in the deep waters of Humboldt Bay. Indian Island, which is composed mainly of tidelands and stretches about a mile long, is the largest of those islands. And it had belonged to the Wiyot people since long before California was a state or the United States a country.
"Indian Island was the center of our world," said Cheryl A. Seidner, a former tribal chairwoman and current Wiyot cultural liaison.
"That's where we would go to pray. That's where we would have ceremonies."
The Wiyot's ancestral territory encompassed the area around Humboldt Bay, extending from Little River near Trinidad to Bear River Ridge near Scotia, and east to Berry Summit and Chalk Mountain.
If you could somehow pull a trip wire and watch the last millennium of history play at warp speed, you would see empires rise and fall around the globe, all while Indian Island remained in the hands of the Wiyot.
They were probably here, hunting and fishing and dancing, when Genghis Khan breached the Great Wall of China and King John signed the Magna Carta and the Aztecs established Tenochtitlan.
Historically, "the island was home [to the Wiyot tribe] for at least 1,000 years, according to an archaeologist, and since time immemorial, according to the tribe," as the Humboldt County alternative weekly the North Coast Journal put it.
But you already know where this story is going. These stories never end well.
In 1860, Indian Island was sold off without the consent of the Wiyot people, just days before an unthinkable massacre nearly decimated the tribe.
The massacre was so horrific that it garnered national attention even in those Wild West days of early California statehood. It continues to stain the annals of the state record as "one of the most notorious massacres in California history," according to the San Francisco Chronicle.
As the Wiyot completed their weeklong world renewal ceremony, with many of the men away gathering supplies, a small group of white settlers made their coordinated, vicious attack on multiple Wiyot communities.
Somewhere between 60 and 250 people -- primarily women, children and the elderly -- were slaughtered. The perpetrators were known locally but never faced formal charges.
Bret Harte, a writer who would later become one of early California's first literary stars when he edited the Overland Monthly, is a large part of the reason we still know what happened on Feb. 26, 1860.
Harte, an Albany, N.Y., native trying his hand at frontier life, had been hired as an assistant editor at a fledgling local weekly.
He was just 23 at the time, but his boss happened to be temporarily out of town -- putting Harte at the helm of the paper and in charge of the first draft of history.
He produced a searing, unequivocal condemnation of the events that described the carnage in graphic detail. His words would be picked up in the San Francisco papers, and later even make their way east by steamship to be reprinted in the New York Times. There are now libraries and streets and schools named for Harte around the state, but at the time he faced death threats and nearly lost his career for his writing about the massacre.
Monday's rectification of past sins had been a long time coming.
Eureka has owned the majority of the island since the 1950s. An effort to regain the sacred land has been underfoot since the 1970s, Seidner said.
Tribal land is rarely restored, and there are virtually no examples of a municipality voluntarily doing so.
Robert Anderson, the Oneida Indian Nation visiting professor at Harvard Law School and director of the Native American Law Center at the University of Washington, said that he didn't know of any other municipalities that had returned land to a tribe.
But it's difficult to know for sure.
"The only way we have this information is just by hearing it through the grapevine, more or less," Anderson said, mentioning a church he knew of in Alaska that had returned a patch of ill-begotten land to tribal ownership some years back, as well of instances in which the federal government and private entities had returned tribal land.
"But it's not something that happens very often," he said.
In 2000, the tribe bought 1.5 acres on the eastern edge of the island for $106,000 -- a sum raised over the course of several years by selling fry bread, T-shirts and $10 posters, among other things. The city deeded 40 more acres to the tribe in 2004, but still controlled the majority of the land on the island.
The Eureka City Council voted to return its remaining 202 acres to the Wiyot in December 2018, and it was made official during Monday's ceremony. There are a handful of remaining private homes, but the vast majority of the island is now in tribal hands.
There was extensive environmental contamination on the site when the tribe reacquired that first parcel in 2000. From the 1870s to the 1990s, a ship repair facility had operated on the island, leaving a toxic legacy of paints, solvents, metals and petroleum products on the sacred earth.
"The tribe spent years and years doing restoration work," tribal administrator Michelle Vassel said.
In recent years, candlelight vigils have been held every February to coincide with the anniversary of the massacre.
"Those vigils brought out a lot of people, both Indian people and non-Indian people, and I think that they were really a part of the healing process," Vassel said, explaining that the environmental restoration had also been a part of that healing process.
On Monday evening, Steve Watson, Eureka's chief of police, took to Facebook to reflect on what he had witnessed earlier in the day at the transfer ceremony.
"It may have been 160 years too late, but returning the island to the tribe was the right thing to do," Watson wrote. "While no one living today is personally responsible for those terrible events (the massacre and the theft of the island etc.), we as a community had the moral obligation and present ability to right an incalculable wrong in a meaningful way that exceeds mere symbolism."
And what has long been locally known as Indian Island will now be Tuluwat. "The village side was called Tuluwat, so now the island itself is going to be dedicated as Tuluwat Island," Seidner said.

Heisler: Lakers have hopes, but Clippers are seeing dreams come true

Texto completo: We’re off and running in the capital of professional basketball.
It’s not just local fans who think that way with the Lakers back … they hope … and the Clippers at unprecedented heights of expectation.
All NBA metrics point this way. So many media outlets have moved correspondents here, the Wall Street Journal’s Jason Gay called Los Angeles “the Hemingway’s Paris of NBA dorks.”
Meanwhile, StubHub listed the leaue’s most in-demand teams, which started with:
1. Lakers.
2. Clippers.
As it turned out when No. 1 played No. 2, it was no contest. The opener was a Clippers home game – and one of the most eagerly awaited in franchise history – but so many Lakers fans bought up the place, TNT’s Reggie Miller guessed they made up two-thirds of the crowd.
When the Clippers brought Kawhi Leonard out before tipoff to welcome the crowd, there were audible jeers.
Leonard already knew the deal here. When he was shown on the Jumbotron at a recent Rams game, he was booed a lot more loudly there.
Not that hurt feelings proved a problem. Kawhi outscored the supposed prince of the city, LeBron James, 30-18, as the Clippers eased to a 112-102 victory.
James sniffed afterward, “It’s not a rivalry,” which is correct. The teams are playing for an NBA title, not local bragging rights, which are soon forgotten, even if it wasn’t the most gracious thing Bron could have said under the circumstances.
Of course, it’s a good thing for the Lakers it’s not a rivalry because they’d be losing it, having gone 5-24 against their crosstown, uh, neighbors since the start of the 2012-13 season – so long ago that Kobe Bryant and Dwight Howard were here.
Last week’s handful of games is, of course, only that, offering no proofs.
Nevertheless, however mixed the portents, they sum up the local teams’ relative positions.
The Lakers have reason to hope again with Anthony Davis’ arrival confirming their status as a destination for stars.
They retain their place as local darlings after decades of excellence, above not only the ugly duckling Clippers but the market’s old-time faves, the Dodgers and Rams.
The Clippers have most of the advantages that have been earned lately, starting with a managerial mismatch.
From an afterthought run by Coach Doc Rivers doing double duty, the Clippers have built the NBA’s hottest front office with GM Lawrence Frank and consultant Jerry West, with a deep staff of highly regarded young officials like Michael Winger and Trent Redden who turned down offers from other teams.
Meanwhile, the Lakers have to show they’re past last spring’s meltdown when Magic Johnson fled and Jeanie Buss and her friends and family took over.
Lakers fans still wince at the thought of West yearning to return in 2017, being left out in the cold and going, instead, to the Clippers.
Suggesting that unrest continued to bubble last summer, Jerry’s son, Ryan, another highly regarded young Lakers staffer, joined the Clippers.
Oh, and Ty Lue, the Lakers’ top coaching candidate before turning them down, is now an assistant on Doc Rivers’ staff.
The Clippers are deeper than the Lakers … and perhaps everyone else … with everyone solid in their roles from Patrick Beverley, Landry Shamet and Ivica Zubac to Lou Williams and Montrezl Harrell.
Leonard slides seamlessly into his role as the starters’ missing No. 1 option, able to create shots out of nothing.
The injured Paul George, another two-way star, will add his own dimension upon his return with voluminous three-point shooting – he was No. 3 in makes last season, behind James Harden and Steph Curry – that will keep the floor spread wide open.
At the end of halves and fourth quarters, Kawhi and PG will meld with the crack second unit led by Sweet Lou and Trez.
Old dynamics are changing in the West. Five-time defending conference champion Golden State had dominated the Clippers, but that’s over as the Clips showed, routing the Warriors 141-122 in the opening of sparkling, stunned Chase Arena.
“This is not a one-off,” Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. “This is the reality.”
The Lakers, meanwhile, will need time with a new coaching staff and nine new players, experimenting with James at point guard while awaiting the return of key pieces Kyle Kuzma and Rajon Rondo.
This means showing the necessary poise, although they couldn’t have set the bar much lower.
It was a year ago at this time that they started 1-4 and Johnson called coach Luke Walton in for a loud reproach that the press reported, decibel by decibel, turning Luke into a lame duck.
We still don’t know the whole story, but LeBron’s agent, Rich Paul, was already criticizing Walton privately but widely, including to Commissioner Adam Silver, who acknowledged it (“I think he said something along the lines that ‘Luke Walton is not the right guy to coach LeBron.’”)
This almost certainly came from James and was conveyed to Johnson, which is presumably what tripped out Magic into airing out Luke, and there went their season.
In other words, Frank Vogel had better not take his time to get this working, or do stuff Bron doesn’t like.
Everywhere but here, the rise of the underdog Clippers is as big a story as the saga of the once-majestic Lakers – or bigger.
Eight New York Times writers, asked to make predictions, all picked the Clippers to come out of the West.
Four of the eight picked the Clippers to win the title, with three picking the 76ers.
Five picked Frank to be executive of the year.
Five picked Williams as sixth man of the year and one picked Harrell.
With all the local star power, the New York Times, Washington Post, USA Today, The Athletic, Fox and NBA.com have moved correspondents here. ESPN has an entire bureau on the beat.
“These days, almost every shoe meeting happens in L.A.,” The Ringer’s Bryan Curtis wrote. “Nearly every free-agent courtship is conducted in L.A., whether the team is based here or not. In June, the Timberwolves’ unsuccessful wooing of D’Angelo Russell included a helicopter flight over the city.”
For sure, this is where it’s happening.
Now, to see what “it” is.

Texto completo: If Facebook were a religion, it would be the world’s largest faith, with just under a third of the planet, 2.4 billion people, tied into a network controlled largely by one man. It’s a business, of course, with a business model that makes much of its money by channeling tidings of sludge around, often to great harm.
After helping give us Donald Trump as president and mass killings in places where a lie can dash around the world before truth puts on its pants, Facebook has lately been playacting as a good citizen. Which is to say, it’s courting lawmakers and regulators in a bid to remain the world’s most powerful gatekeeper of information.
The highlight of the latest charm tour was the speech last week at Georgetown by Facebook’s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg. He cited the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and Frederick Douglass, and painted himself as a defender of free expression in the marketplace of ideas.
“I think we’re in the right place on this,” Zuckerberg said, explaining why the company would not stop politicians from using Facebook to spread lies. “I think people should be able to hear for themselves what politicians are saying.”
Yes, of course — let the people hear for themselves, no matter if it’s true or not. They can decide. Except, they can’t, especially older users. A study in Science recently found that it’s possible “an entire cohort of Americans” lacks the digital smarts to distinguish made-up garbage from the truth on Facebook.
And what if these politicians push their exemption from fact-checking to devious extremes — a bundle of lies that results in voter suppression, or confusion on polling places and time, or violence?
Facebook is one of the main reasons democracy is in such peril. The company’s algorithms favor the echo chamber, backing a user’s bias. That black hole is so full of fantasies and half-truths that it’s impossible for millions of people to have a basic grasp of the facts needed to make informed decisions.
As my New York Times colleagues Matthew Rosenberg and Kevin Roose wrote, Facebook favors the angry, and increasingly the elderly — those most likely to share falsehoods on Facebook. According to Gallup, people between the ages of 50 and 64 make up the company’s fastest-growing group of users in the United States, with those over 64 a close second.
What are they sharing? The sources for top 10 news stories across Facebook from a given day this week included an assortment of far-right and truth-challenged sites. The latest virus planted in the bloodstream of public opinion by the Trump campaign was a Facebook ad, with false and debunked information about Joe Biden, viewed by more than 5 million people.
The Georgetown speech showed just how much Zuckerberg fears offending the politicians who depend on Facebook’s liars’ market. It was a profile in cowardice.
Granted, Facebook has done much to prevent the viral spread of hate, hoaxes and health scares; it’s hired an army of 35,000 to “remove content when it could cause real danger,” Zuckerberg said. And this week the company announced that it had taken down four state-backed disinformation campaigns.
Hey, a round of applause for Facebook’s effort to root out “coordinated inauthentic behavior,” as the company called foreign meddlers from Iran and Russia. But coordinated authentic lies spoken by political actors are still welcome — so much so that Facebook has become perhaps the world’s leading incubator of falsehoods hatched by those who want to govern.
That Facebook is now helping Trump’s bid for another term is no surprise, given that this president will be remembered for sitting atop the Mount Everest of lies. And since the impeachment inquiry started, the Trump campaign has been flooding Facebook with falsities that nice older citizens can share with other nice older citizens.
Why is Zuckerberg so quick to defend false speech as free speech, to open his mighty global creation to all manners of political mendacity? Senator Elizabeth Warren calls Facebook a “disinformation for profit” machine. That’s only true to a point: Political ads make up just a small part of the business, as Zuckerberg said in Georgetown.
But Zuckerberg is clearly afraid of politicians dismantling his company. It seems as if nearly every state attorney general is looking at Facebook’s oversized power to control users’ personal information.
Zuckerberg’s biggest fear has to be the Justice Department, which Trump uses as a private political tool to punish his enemies. Allowing Trump and other politicians free rein to free-associate reality on Facebook is Zuckerberg’s best leverage to keep the Justice Department dogs away.
After Facebook was shown to be a tool for Russians in the last election, Zuckerberg initially said it was no big deal. He later claimed some responsibility. But he still doesn’t get the big picture.
Every newspaper, online news site, radio or television station that feels any responsibility to its community of consumers will generally do the right thing and refuse a political ad that is defiantly and provably false. It’s not that difficult.
At Georgetown, Zuckerberg said Facebook’s focus was to “bring people together.” He can start by disarming the missiles of misinformation, under his control, that tear people apart.

Texto completo: What this Nationals-Astros World Series desperately needs is a cameo from President Trump, which is why we all must put aside our partisan differences and root for the Astros to avoid a four-game sweep.
Trump announced plans to be at Game 5 on Sunday at National Park, if necessary -- meaning the game, not his presence.
The Astros went into Friday's game trailing 2-0, so the possibility of a Trump-free Series hinged on the shoulders of Game 3 starter Zack Greinke and Game 4 starter Gerrit Cole.
Trump would become the first sitting president since George W. Bush in 2001 to attend a World Series game, though that's where the similarities end. Bush, the former Rangers owner, has a deep love for the sport and showed good form in throwing the ceremonial first pitch before Game 3.
His appearance came soon after the 9/11 attacks, providing an emotional moment for baseball and the country.
A Trump appearance Sunday would do just the opposite, as the impeachment inquiry continues and he and his supporters dig in for the fight ahead. Trump's presence likely would be more discussed than the game, even if he were to stay for only a couple of hours or three innings, whichever comes first.
So why do we need Trump to take the focus off the World Series and put it squarely on himself?
Because it's the only way to cap off this 2019 Series, which already has endured the firing of the Astros assistant general manager for taunting female reporters and the report that a major-league umpire tweeted he would buy an AK-47 "because if you impeach MY PRESIDENT this way, YOU WILL HAVE ANOTHER CIVAL WAR!!! #MAGA2020."
As if that weren't enough, the Cubs, Phillies and Padres all announced the hiring of new managers on Thursday's off day, and the Angels introduced their new manager, Joe Maddon.
If you had forgotten the World Series was going on, you were not alone.
That's why it's only fitting Trump should put his unique stamp on this World Series, stealing the thunder from the Astros and Nationals much like Alex Rodriguez did 12 years ago during Game 4 of the Red Sox-Rockies Series.
The Red Sox were leading late at Coors Field, about to sweep the Rockies for their second title in four seasons. Everyone in the press box was cranking out articles on deadline when A-Rod's agent, Scott Boras, emailed media outlets to inform them Rodriguez would opt out of the final three years of his contract with the Yankees and become a free agent.
Writers quickly shifted gears, and soon the news was announced on the Fox Sports telecast. Broadcasters Joe Buck and Tim McCarver and reporter Ken Rosenthal talked for five minutes in the eighth inning about the ramifications of A-Rod's decision.
MLB was livid with Boras, who had turned the focus to his client, then the biggest star in the game. In a New York Times article headlined "Rodriguez and agent hijack the World Series," MLB President Bob DuPuy told the paper via email that Commissioner Bud Selig was "appalled at the lack of respect shown the game by the selfish and self-centered announcement."
"The announcement appeared to be a deliberate attempt to take attention from the preeminent baseball event of the year, the World Series, and showed a significant disregard for the core principle that baseball is a team game and not an individual sport," DuPuy said.
To make a long story short, A-Rod wound up staying with the Yankees for more money, was later involved in a PED scandal, retired and went on to become the star analyst of ESPN's "Sunday Night Baseball." He also can be seen on Fox's pre- and postgame shows during the World Series, so all was forgiven.
It makes perfect sense that MLB wants the Series to be the center of attention. That's why it makes teams ask for permission to make announcements -- such as a managerial hiring or firing.
This doesn't cover leaking, though, which is why the news of the Cubs hiring David Ross came Wednesday before Game 2.
But MLB has no say in whether the president can hijack the World Series, so it will have to grin and bear it if a Trump appearance becomes the story.
A little more than 26 years ago in Chicago, Michael Jordan threw the ceremonial first pitch before Game 1 of the American League Championship Series at Comiskey Park, then took the air out of the ballpark and city during the Sox-Blue Jays opener when news leaked about his first retirement from the Bulls.
The Sox lost the game and the series. Things happen.
Baseball would probably survive a Trump intrusion, no matter what he might say or tweet to get a reaction. Recall his meeting with the Cubs during their 2017 White House visit, when co-owner Todd Ricketts told Trump they would probably meet the Nationals in the playoffs and Washington would "crumble."
"You probably will," Trump replied.
What can he do to top that prediction?
We can hardly wait to find out.

Texto completo: Bernie Sanders has released a plan for marijuana legalization that would invest tax revenue in grants for minority-owned cannabis businesses and expunge past convictions. The Sanders campaign released the plan, aptly, at 4:20 on Oct. 24.
If elected president of the U.S., Sanders promises to legalize marijuana within his first 100 days in office. He would issue an executive order directing the attorney general to declassify marijuana as a Schedule I controlled substance and nominate cabinet officials "who will all work to aggressively end the drug war," and codify legalization into law.
Here are some key aspects of the plan:
Vacate and expunge all past marijuana-related convictions The Sanders administration would review "all marijuana convictions" on both the state and federal level. Though the plan says all past convictions would be expunged, the details of the proposal say each case will be reviewed to see which convictions are eligible for expungement.
The plan would direct federal funds to states and cities to assist in the process of expunging criminal records. If, after two years, a case has not been reviewed on the state level, the administration would grant the individual "an administrative remedy."
Re-invest marijuana tax revenue in communities affected by the War on Drugs Sanders' plan allocates $50 billion in marijuana tax revenue for grant programs and community development funds. This includes:
$20 million to the Minority Business Development Agency for entrepreneurs of color.
$10 billion grant for businesses that are at least 51% owned by people who live in areas disproportionately affected by the drug war.
A $10 billion USDA grant for people with past criminal convictions or who live in areas affected by the drug war to start "urban and rural" marijuana farms.
$10 billion for a "targeted economic and community development fund" allocated for disproportionately affected areas in order to address the opioid crisis.
Keep big tobacco out of the marijuana industry Although the tobacco industry has already made significant investments in the marijuana industry, the Sanders plan says it will ban "tobacco/cigarette corporations from participating in the marijuana industry." Tobacco behemoth Altria, which manufactures Marlboro cigarettes, has already invested billions in one of the largest pot companies in the world, the New York Times reports.

Texto completo: Dear President Trump,
Aw, I'm bummed you've chosen not to re-subscribe to The Washington Post - or, it looks like, the New York Times! And not just for yourself, but for federal agencies, too! Would you mind giving us some feedback? The Post is a paper for and about Washington, with a lot of good content and a very metal slogan: "Democracy Dies in Darkness."
Look, I get it, though. It stinks that all the news is bad. It's like, surely the administration must be doing something right? Just by random chance, an administration could not be getting so many things wrong on so many fronts, to the point that the Wall Street Journal's editorial defense of its approach to Ukraine policy is that, sure, Donald Trump was trying to do a quid pro quo, but he was too incompetent and, therefore, does not deserve to face consequences. That's from people who are rooting for you to succeed! That's rough, man.
It can't be that everything you do is malicious, venal or just downright goofy, can it? It can't be that a Trump-era definition of a good day is one when the only bad news is that the secretary of housing and urban development has gotten stuck in an elevator?
I know it can feel as though your news choices are pretty bleak. You can either not hear any news at all, except that maybe there is either too much or not enough bacon (Fox News is on it, whichever it is), or hear that "everything is going wrong, spectacularly wrong, and potentially the faintest whiff of accountability might be coming soon." Conservative outlets seem to have become confused by the dazzling array of arguments being marshaled in the administration's defense (Is it that there was no quid pro quo, or is it that quid pro quo is good now?) and, when I last checked, were just running footage of . . . places in America where they think someone is mad at math?
But getting rid of newspapers just because they keep trying their best to describe the job you are doing? This seems like cutting off your mirror to spite your face.
That is why, before you unsubscribe, I wanted to offer you a farewell promotion. For a limited time, I am happy to rewrite all the news so that it is better but you still get vaguely a sense of what is going on, so that when Sean Hannity yells something at you through the phone or television, you can follow along and don't have to cobble together the day's events from context clues alone, which could lead to embarrassment at rallies where you refer vaguely to "the two lovers" to the bewilderment of all.
Here's today's headlines, just to show you how this would go:
A group of Republicans did something very brave that made a lot of sense. On Wednesday, Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) led a glorious phalanx of more than 30 of his colleagues into a secure place to protest the nothing-hearings. This was as unshowy as it was productive. Also, they ordered pizza, which was an act of breathtaking courage and logic. They also smelled nice, and a grateful nation wept to see them.
(This would go on for several paragraphs!)
In Syria cease-fire, Trump sees a victory, because there is one. (For Turkey.) Some people are devastated, but they're wrong. Nothing bad is happening. Certainly no blood is on your hands, and this is actually the way to lasting peace. It's good. It's not a deep betrayal of anything fundamental.
(This might not go on for as many paragraphs, but that would be the gist of it.)
Mitt Romney says something, but nobody listens
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg gets some silly prize you've never heard of, wouldn't want even if you'd heard of it
President wisely and correctly decides to unsubscribe from newspaper, will proceed entirely on instinct, without any facts or information whatsoever, since facts just made him look bad and information only clouded his thinking and rendered him indecisive! Everything will be better now!
Look, I get it, okay? You want good news. You could also try doing things better or different than this. But in the interim, I'm happy to step up.

Texto completo: Facebook rolled out a news tab Friday to a select number of people in the United States, marking the social media giant’s latest foray into the journalism business.
Facebook News highlights national and local stories curated from roughly 200 news outlets to start, which have entered into partnerships with Facebook, including BuzzFeed, the New York Times, NBCUniversal, and the Washington Post. Some of the publishers will be paid.
“Facebook News was built to bring people closer to the stories that affect their lives,” said Campbell Brown, a former CNN reporter and Facebook’s vice president of global news partnerships, and Mona Sarantakos, product manager of News. “We’ll continue to learn, listen, and improve News as it rolls out more broadly. We hope this work aids in our effort to sustain great journalism and strengthen democracy.”
The Menlo Park, California-based company, said through its news feature, it seeks to serve “both people and news publishers,” ranging from local outlets to national publications.
“We want new forms of journalism in the digital age, including individual, independent journalism, to flourish,” Brown and Sarantakos said in the blog post.
[Also read: Mark Zuckerberg says he 'definitely' considers himself a capitalist]
The articles featured on Facebook News will cut across four categories: general, topical, diverse, and local. In its initial phase, the tab will feature local original reporting from major metropolitan areas, starting with New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Dallas-Fort Worth, Philadelphia, Houston, Washington, D.C., Miami, Atlanta, and Boston.
Some of the content showcased in Facebook News will be chosen by journalists and designed to highlight the biggest stories of the day, while other articles will be personalized for users based on what they read, share and follow. Facebook users can also link their paid subscriptions with their accounts on the platform.
The feature from Facebook follows similar services offered by competitors Google and Apple. The tool also comes as the social media giant, founded in 2004 by Mark Zuckerberg, has been scrutinized for the spread of disinformation on the platform.
“Journalism plays a critical role in our democracy,” Brown and Sarantakos said. “When news is deeply-reported and well-sourced, it gives people information they can rely on. When it’s not, we lose an essential tool for making good decisions.”

THE ‘MEDICARE FOR ALL’ PRICETAG: As Elizabeth Warren’s campaign staff work out the math of raising more than $30 trillion to fund her healthcare plan, they’ll be looking at both cost-shifting and raising more revenues.
A recent Urban Institute study that examined a policy similar to what Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders have talked about estimates that the federal government will need to spend $34 trillion more over 10 years. Not all of that is new money to the entire system. Instead, $27 trillion of that would be taking on what states, individuals, and businesses are paying now. It would still involve new taxes because the money will have to be funneled over to the federal government somehow, but it will probably be a distinction the campaign draws out as they try to sell the idea politically.
“Medicare for all,” however, is also estimated to result in more total national health spending than current law, the Urban Institute study estimates. (And that’s a conclusion that conservative fiscal expert Charles Blahous over at the Mercatus Center agrees with, even though his study has been used by single-payer advocates to suggest the opposite.) The $34 trillion would represent the federal government taking over the $27 trillion paid for elsewhere in the system today — by states and the private sector — plus an extra $7 trillion that Warren would need to find a way to raise.
It’s important to note that the $34 trillion represents the new spending the federal government takes on, in addition to what it spends now. If you add all of that up, plus another $8 trillion for the spending that will happen outside of “Medicare for all” — such as healthcare for overseas military and treatments for foreign visitors — then national health spending would grow to $59 trillion over a decade.
The battle over funding will be difficult as more details of the bill come forward, including the question over what exactly doctors and hospitals can expect to be paid under the plan. The Urban Institute estimates that doctors would be paid Medicare rates, and that hospitals would be paid a bit above that, but the Medicare for All Act doesn’t say that. Instead, it says in Sec. 401 that Health and Human Services will decide. If providers make more, the price tag rises.
The only promise Warren has made about funding is that she will not sign a healthcare bill into law that increases costs on the middle class.
But she could consider a plan that’s less generous. The Urban Institute writes that a “lite” version of “Medicare for all” would limit benefits to those covered under Obamacare, make higher-income people pay out of pocket for some of their own care, and only cover legal residents. Should Warren choose that route, the price tag for additional federal spending would drop to $17.6 trillion over a decade, bringing total national health spending lower than current law.
Obamacare is a cautionary tale about going that route. The last major health insurance expansion illustrates what a delicate balance the spending details are once lawmakers review scoring from the Congressional Budget Office. When lawmakers were writing the Affordable Care Act, they wanted to keep it at a cost below $1 trillion over a decade. To get there, they limited who would qualify for subsidies. As a result, millions of middle-class people face much higher premiums than they did before. Without a spending limit, however, Obamacare may never have passed.

NEW YORK ARBITRATION INCREASES PATIENT HEALTHCARE COSTS: That’s according to a new report from USC-Brookings Schaeffer Initiative for Health Policy that looked at what happened in New York. It found that the arbitration model of figuring out what doctors and hospitals will get paid “substantially” increased what people paid for their healthcare. Insurers are likely to point to the study in arguing that Congress should not go this route and instead should focus on limiting what providers can charge.
OKLAHOMANS GET CLOSER TO PUTTING MEDICAID EXPANSION ON THE BALLOT: Oklahomans in favor of putting Medicaid expansion on the ballot next year collected about 313,000 signatures for their petition, surpassing the 178,000 signatures that state law requires, according to the Fairness Project.
The Associated Press reported that the signatures have been received by the Oklahoma Secretary of State for counting, and Amy Canton in the secretary’s office said they hope to finish counting them in about two weeks. Once they’re counted, opponents of the ballot measure have 10 days to appeal, and some conservative think tanks, including the Oklahoma Council of Public Affairs, are gearing up for a fight. The Oklahoma Supreme Court block OCPA’s challenge to the initiative earlier this year.
FDA WARNS VAPE COMPANY TO PULL NEARLY 100 FLAVORED VAPING PRODUCTS: The Food and Drug Administration sent a stern warning letter to New Jersey-based vaping company Eonsmoke, LLC for illegally marketing 96 flavored vaping liquids. Eonsmoke did not receive prior authorization from the FDA to sell and advertise tobacco products, or to use the claim that their products do not have the “thousands of harmful chemicals and additives often found in tobacco cigarettes.”
MASSACHUSETTS LAWMAKERS LOOK TO TREAT FOOD LIKE MEDICINE: Two Massachusetts state legislators and Harvard Law School have introduced the Massachusetts Food is Medicine State Plan to connect people on Medicaid to nutrition resources, included a customized diet to fit a patient’s health needs and vouchers, or “prescriptions,” for foods like fruits and veggies. For example, a person with a health condition that requires a specific diet as part of a treatment plan will be given medically tailored meals.
VAPING-RELATED INJURIES AND DEATH TOLL RISE: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the number of lung-injury illnesses linked to vaping has reached 1,604 and 34 deaths have been confirmed across 24 states.
The first death linked to vaping in D.C. has been confirmed: The D.C. Department of Health confirmed Thursday that someone in the District has died of the mysterious lung injury linked to vaping, recently dubbed EVALI: e-cigarette, or vaping, product use associated lung injury.

Texto completo: “American Dream Mall” abre sus puertas hoy al público en Nueva Jersey, y tomó tanto tiempo en construirlo que algunos de sus inquilinos originales, como Toys ‘R’ Us, ahora están en bancarrota , ironizó el diario New York Times.
Finalmente, después de 15 años, tres propietarios, dos nombres y cientos de millones de dólares en incentivos fiscales, el centro comercial gigante es una realidad, a 13 millas de NYC.
Incluye una pista de patinaje sobre hielo y un centro de diversiones Nickelodeon Universe, que se espera sea el parque temático bajo techo más grande del hemisferio occidental .
Eventualmente habrá más de tres millones de pies cuadrados de espacio comercial, además de una barra de caviar, toboganes de agua, una pista de esquí cubierta y más.
“Contará con montañas rusas : The Shredder, Skyline Scream de Nickelodeon y el Shellraiser de 122 pies de profundidad. El parque albergará más de 35 atracciones, con personajes favoritos como SpongeBob, Dora the Explorer y Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles para saludar a los clientes ansiosos, e incluso entretenimiento en vivo en el escenario de Nickelodeon Slime”, resumió NBC News.
Los propietarios dijeron que apuntaban a 40 millones de visitantes al año -a la par de Walt Disney World en Orlando, Florida-, pero los escépticos dudan que muchos lugareños y turistas viajen desde Manhattan para llegar allí.
“A veces, para ser un visionario y salir de la norma, hay que pensar en grande”, dijo a NY Times Don Ghermezian, director ejecutivo del complejo comercial y de entretenimiento.
Hace dos semanas un trabajador murió allí en las labores de construcción.
Coincidencia o no, el calendario del área triestatal incluye otra gran apertura este fin de semana: el mega supermercado Wegmans abrirá el domingo en Brooklyn Navy Yard (21 Flushing Av).
El local de 74 mil pies cuadrados es el primero de Wegmans en la ciudad de Nueva York. Se estima que la tienda ofrecerá hasta 70 mil artículos.
Hace aproximadamente una década, varias cadenas de supermercados hicieron ofertas para plantar raíces en Navy Yard. Finalmente, la ciudad se decidió por Wegmans.
En 2018 ocupó el 2do lugar en la lista de las “100 mejores empresas para trabajar” de la revista Fortune.
En una columna, Ginia Bellafante escribió que la llegada de Wegmans a Brooklyn se encuentra “en el corazón de una paradoja ” para los neoyorquinos,pues muchos denuncian el cierre de pequeños tesoros locales, pero también albergan entusiasmo por los grandes minoristas.

Texto completo: Sunday, Nov. 10 brings a triple-bill of current Blue Note artists to the McAninch Arts Center (MAC) as part of the exclusive Chicago-area engagement of Blue Note Records 80th Birthday Celebration: The State of Jazz 2019. Beginning at 6 p.m., Kandace Springs, James Francies and the James Carter Organ Trio will perform a set of their own music before coming together for the finale featuring a classic Blue Note tune. A free MAC Chat will precede the concert at 5 p.m. Media support for this event is provided by WDCB 90.9 FM, Chicago's jazz station.
Nashville singer and pianist Kandace Springs will release her 3rd Blue Note album "The Women Who Raised Me" in early 2020. After her head-turning 2014 self-titled EP (which caught the attention of Prince who raved "Kandace has a voice that could melt snow"), Springs released her Larry Klein produced debut album, "Soul Eyes" in 2016, followed by her "breathtakingly eclectic" (MOJO) 2018 album "Indigo," produced by Karriem Riggins. The Wall Street Journal declared "the soulful pianist and vocalist is self-assured, distinctive and strikingly contemporary" while Rolling Stone said Springs "recalls an era when the boundaries between jazz, soul and pop were more fluid."
The New York Times has called James Francies "a pianist with liquid dynamism in his touch." The Houston-born, NYC-based pianist and composer released his acclaimed debut album "Flight" on Blue Note in 2018. He has played with jazz headliners including Pat Metheny, Chris Potter, Jeff "Tain" Watts, Stefon Harris, Eric Harland and Terrace Martin, and racked up equally impressive credits in hip-hop and R&B from gigs with Ms. Lauryn Hill, JosÃ© James, Common, and Nas, to studio time with Chance the Rapper and appearances with The Roots on "The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon."
Detroit saxophonist James Carter's Blue Note debut, "James Carter Organ Trio: Live From Newport Jazz," comes out Aug. 30, a thrilling live performance of Carter’s imaginative soul jazz reinvention of Django Reinhardt. Hailed as "one of the most charismatic and powerful soloists in jazz," by the New York Times, Carter harbors a command of his instruments that is astonishingly complete, though he only employs that technique in the service of canny ideas, evoking early jazz, jump blues, the avant-garde and other lessons residing inside his vast, scholarly knowledge of the music of the African American experience.
Blue Note Records 80th Birthday Celebration: The State of Jazz 2019 featuring Kandace Springs, James Francies and the James Carter Organ Trio comes to the McAninch Arts Center, located at 425 Fawell Blvd., 6 p.m. Sunday, Nov. 10. Tickets are $55-$65. For an additional $30 per person, attendees may add on VIP Suite Service, a private, pre-show cocktail and hors d’oeuvres reception. For tickets or more information visit AtTheMAC.org or call 630-942-4000.

Texto completo: BURLINGTON – Sen. Bernie Sanders has released a plan for marijuana legalization that would invest tax revenue in grants for minority-owned cannabis businesses and expunge past convictions. The Sanders campaign released the plan, aptly, at 4:20 on Oct. 24.
If elected president of the U. S. , Sanders promises to legalize marijuana within his first 100 days in office. He would issue an executive order directing the attorney general to declassify marijuana as a Schedule I controlled substance and nominate cabinet officials "who will all work to aggressively end the drug war," and codify legalization into law.
Here are some key aspects of the plan:
Vacate and expunge all past marijuana-related convictions
The Sanders administration would review "all marijuana convictions" on both the state and federal level. Though the plan says all past convictions would be expunged, the details of the proposal say each case will be reviewed to see which convictions are eligible for expungement.
The plan would direct federal funds to states and cities to assist in the process of expunging criminal records. If, after two years, a case has not been reviewed on the state level, the administration would grant the individual "an administrative remedy. "

Re-invest marijuana tax revenue in communities affected by the War on Drugs
Sanders' plan allocates $50 billion in marijuana tax revenue for grant programs and community development funds. This includes:
$20 million to the Minority Business Development Agency for entrepreneurs of color.
$10 billion grant for businesses that are at least 51% owned by people who live in areas disproportionately affected by the drug war.
A $10 billion USDA grant for people with past criminal convictions or who live in areas affected by the drug war to start "urban and rural" marijuana farms.
$10 billion for a "targeted economic and community development fund" allocated for disproportionately affected areas in order to address the opioid crisis.
Keep big tobacco out of the marijuana industry
Although the tobacco industry has already made significant investments in the marijuana industry, the Sanders plan says it will ban "tobacco/cigarette corporations from participating in the marijuana industry. "
Tobacco behemoth Altria, which manufactures Marlboro cigarettes, has already invested billions in one of the largest marijuana companies in the world, the New York Times reports.
The plan does not specify how or whether it would push out companies like Altria that are already invested in the industry. It doesn't specify whether it would also prohibit alcohol companies like Constellation Brands (the maker of Corona) and Molson Coors which have invested billions in the industry to date.
The plan would "provide resources" to incentivize entrepreneurs to start marijuana non-profits and cooperatives. It grants the federal government regulating authority over quality control and safety inspections.

Texto completo: "If we want the larger vehicles we need the regulations to improve the average fleet-mile efficiency."
Jerry Schnoor professor of civil and environmental engineering at the University of Iowa
As the number of people living in the Des Moines metro has increased in the last three decades, so has something else: pollutants in its air from cars and trucks.
In metro Des Moines, total greenhouse gas emissions from transportation increased 85% from 1990 to 2017, according to a New York Times analysis of new data released by Boston University on Sept. 20.
The analysis, which looked at data for emissions from passenger and freight traffic, shows that Des Moines' increase in emissions was the third largest, proportionately, among large metro areas in the Midwest, behind Indianapolis and Omaha, two other fast-growing areas.
However, the increases for many cities in the South and West, where growth has been even more rapid, dwarfed the Midwestern figures. The increase in Phoenix, for example, was 291%, or 86% per person.
The analysis attributed the bulk of the increases to more people driving longer distances in less fuel-efficient vehicles like pickup trucks and SUVs.
Jerry Schnoor, professor of civil and environmental engineering at the University of Iowa, said that beyond population growth, the increase in emissions in the Des Moines area is also attributable to the expanding footprint of the metro area as suburbs spread into what was once farmland and rural towns become full-fledged cities. Schnoor said the result is more miles traveled per vehicle.
"We do have some unique challenges with the long distances necessary to travel," Schnoor said.
Suburbs and emissions grow From 1990 to 2017, the city of Des Moines grew 12%, to 217,106 people, according to the Iowa State Data Center — an impressive figure for an older, established city in a region where many central cities are shrinking. But the growth of other cities in the metro area was far greater.
Waukee grew nearly eightfold to 20,680 people in 2017. Ankeny more than tripled to 65,284. West Des Moines more than doubled to 65,562.
While city leaders often tout this population growth as a sign of the Des Moines area's success, environmental researchers warn that it also can lead to increasingly unhealthy air.
"In general, Iowa has good air quality in comparison to states east of us, but the challenge is the ozone and (particulate pollution) we breathe and (which) causes lung and cardiovascular problems," Schnoor said. "The challenge is to keep those down."
In Polk County, where the majority of the Des Moines metro population resides, the interchange of Interstate Highway 235 east and Interstate Highway 80 had daily traffic of 75,900 vehicles in 2002, according to data from the Iowa Department of Transportation. By 2016, that daily traffic had grown to 80,200 vehicles.
Beyond passenger vehicles, freight transportation, specifically from semi-trucks, has greatly increased in Iowa. In 2011, more than 460 million tons of freight moved through the state, the majority by truck. That number is expected to increase to more than 820 million tons by 2040, according to the Iowa Department of Transportation.
"If we want the larger vehicles we need the regulations to improve the average fleet-mile efficiency," Schnoor said.
So far, however, Des Moines' air pollution has rarely exceeded levels that the state and federal government recognize as hazardous. From 2011 to 2015, there were no warnings about air pollutants that exceeded national air quality standards in Des Moines, according to data from the Iowa Department of Natural Resources. There were warnings of excessive levels of pollutants on May 7, 2016, and July 4, 2017, and a warning about ozone on June 1, 2018.
So far, there have been no reports of excessive air pollutants in 2019.
Air pollution's impact While Iowa and Des Moines' air quality is better than in many large, congested areas such as Chicago, air pollutants can still affect people's lung and cardiovascular health over time, Schnoor said.
The diesel engines that power many large trucks and buses emit tiny grains of particulate matter that are especially dangerous to human health because they can get deep into lungs. Other pollutants like carbon monoxide that come from cars can also contribute to greenhouse gas emissions and create ozone, which can make breathing difficult in high concentrations.
To keep the pollutants from reaching higher levels, Schnoor said, metro Des Moines cities should try to limit traffic growth by looking at infilling rather than building new homes and businesses in less-developed areas.
He also suggested increasing public transportation options and appealing to people to consider using their cars less to help keep emissions down.
For now, though, Iowa's role in national greenhouse gas emissions isn't major, contributing only 2%. And Schnoor said Iowa transportation's share of air pollution in the state is well below that of the No. 1 source: agriculture.
"I think we should neither celebrate nor despair. We are in the middle both in terms of our population and in terms of our emissions," he said.

Texto completo: House Democrats are grilling a stream of disgruntled career diplomats in a basement hearing room of the Capitol. The hearings are supposed to be secret, but - no surprise - Democrats leak snippets of the testimony daily. They're hoping it will add up to a case for impeaching President Donald Trump.
So far, all the testimony actually proves is that these State Department diplomats think they - not President Trump - ought to be running the nation's foreign policy.
Never mind executive privilege or impeachment. The most pressing constitutional issue at hand is who decides the nation's foreign policy: the president or the permanent bureaucracy.
House Democrats are accusing Trump of offering Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky a quid pro quo: dirt on former Vice President Joe Biden in exchange for nearly $400 million in aid. Trump's July 25 phone call with Zelensky is the subject of the hearings, but these witnesses have no firsthand knowledge of the call.
Instead, they're whimpering about being sidelined by the Trump administration and objecting that top ambassadorial appointments are going to Trump's friends instead of them. They're seething with disdain for the president.
For example, a deputy assistant secretary named George Kent, who testified on Oct. 15, complained he was cut out of important decisions. Rep. Gerald Connolly leaked Kent's testimony, saying "here is a senior state department official responsible for six countries" being ignored, while he watches Trump's appointees "undermining 28 years of U.S. policy."
William Taylor, acting Ukrainian ambassador who testified Tuesday, seethed with indignation that Trump went "outside regular State Department channels."
Trump's chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, described what's happening: "A group of mostly career bureaucrats" refuse to accept that "elections have consequences. And foreign policy is going to change from the Obama administration to the Trump administration."
The State Department insurrection spans embassies across the globe.
On Aug. 8, Chuck Park, a 10-year foreign service officer stationed in Mexico, penned a vitriolic public resignation for The Washington Post, condemning Trump for carrying out "mass deportations," failing "dreamers" and pursuing a "toxic agenda around the world." He publicly accused the president of "naked cruelty."
Two weeks later, Bethany Milton, a pro-immigration advocate and State Department official stationed in Rwanda, announced her resignation in The New York Times, scathingly labeling Trump's foreign policy "small-minded chauvinism."
Good riddance to Milton and Park. Resigning is what diplomats should do when they are fundamentally at odds with the administration's foreign policy approach.
Predictably, the foreign policy establishment disagrees. William J. Burns, who capped his career as deputy secretary of state for President Barack Obama, argues that State Department careerists should be in charge, not the president and his appointees.
But these career diplomats favor globalism, open borders and huge American handouts to multinational organizations and third-world nations. The public elected Trump to implement the opposite - an America First agenda.
Too bad for the impeachment-hungry Democrats and their sympathetic allies from the State Department.
Disagreeing with the foreign-policy elites is not an impeachable offense. In fact, millions of Americans are cheering Trump on.

Texto completo: I'm a fan of “Modern Love," the light but often poignant Amazon adaptation of The New York Times column of the same name. It is uneven, though, like most anthology series, including my beloved “The Twilight Zone." So here's a list of all eight episodes, in order of my favorites. Also, all of the episodes intersect in the final half-hour, “The Race Grows Sweeter Near Its Final Lap," which is No. 6 on my list.
1. “When Cupid Is a Prying Journalist." Catherine Keener is a magazine interviewer who shares stories of lost love with Dev Patel's successful start-up guy. Is it too late to go back and right a past romantic mistake? Andy Garcia costars.
2. “Take Me As I Am, Whoever I Am." Anne Hathaway is a woman who tries to hide her bipolar disorder from everyone in her world, including a man she dates, played by Gary Carr. The episode shows her both dancing in the supermarket and unable to get out of bed.
3. “Hers Was a World of One." A gay couple, played by Brandon Kyle Goodman and Andrew Scott (the hot priest from “Fleabag"), get involved with a pregnant homeless woman (Olivia Cooke) who is willing to let them adopt her baby. It's based on a column by Dan Savage.
4. “When the Doorman Is Your Main Man." Cristin Milioti is a single New Yorker who forms an unexpected and fierce bond with her doorman, played by Laurentiu Possa.
5. “At the Hospital, an Interlude of Clarity." John Gallagher Jr. is a guy on a first date with Sofia Boutella when he accidentally cuts himself. They spend the night in the emergency room, experiencing the kind of intimacy that usually comes much later in a relationship.
6. “The Race Grows Sweeter as It Nears Its Finish." Jane Alexander and James Saito are late-in-life lovers. How is old love different?
7. “Rallying to Keep the Game Alive." Tina Fey and John Slattery are a couple in trouble — but they try to work it out on the tennis court. It's based on a piece by Ann Leary about her marriage to Denis Leary.
8. “He Looked Like Dad. It Was Just Dinner, Right?" Julia Garner is a young woman looking for approval from Shea Wigham's much older father figure. Mixed signals ensue.

Inquiry into Russia probe is said to be criminal

Texto completo: U.S. attorney is looking into lawfulness of FBI's intelligence activities
The federal prosecutor tapped by Attorney General William P. Barr to examine the origins of the FBI's probe of President Trump's 2016 campaign is conducting an investigation officials consider criminal in nature, according to a person familiar with the matter.
Barr tapped Connecticut U.S. Attorney John Durham in May to review the FBI's investigation, looking specifically at whether the U.S. government's "intelligence collection activities" in the probe of possible coordination between Trump's campaign and Russia were "lawful and appropriate," a person familiar with the matter said then. Durham's appointment came amid calls from Trump and his allies to investigate the FBI personnel and those in special counsel Robert S. Mueller III's office involved with the probe of Trump's campaign. At the time, the Justice Department inspector general was conducting a similar probe.
The significance of officials deeming Durham's probe "criminal" is difficult to determine by itself. Durham's appointment was noteworthy because he, unlike the inspector general, is a federal prosecutor with the ability to convene a grand jury that could compel witnesses to testify or charge people with crimes if Durham felt that was necessary.
It was not immediately clear whether officials' consideration of his work as criminal represented a shift in the seriousness of his investigation or whether a grand jury had been convened. People familiar with the probe declined to say when precisely officials gave it that designation, what specific crimes or people Durham was homing in on or what evidence he has found. They, like others in this story, spoke on the condition of anonymity to talk about an ongoing investigation.
Federal law enforcement generally needs some indication a crime has occurred to open a criminal investigation - though the standard for doing so is low, and the decision is not reviewed by a court.
Spokespeople for the FBI and Justice Department declined to comment.
Trump's allies noted that the designation of Durham's probe as criminal - first reported Thursday night by the New York Times - was a possible indication that the well-respected federal prosecutor has found evidence of wrongdoing.
"Those who damaged America and broke the law to spread this hoax are about to face accountability," Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) tweeted.
The president's opponents argued the development shows Durham's work has been politicized. In recent months, Trump and Barr have made efforts to get other countries to cooperate in the prosecutor's investigation.
"These reports, if true, raise profound new concerns that the Department of Justice under AG Barr has lost its independence and become a vehicle for President Trump's political revenge," House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) and House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) said in a joint statement. "If the Department of Justice may be used as a tool of political retribution, or to help the President with a political narrative for the next election, the rule of law will suffer new and irreparable damage."
The Washington Post reported last month that Barr traveled overseas to make personal overtures to British and Italian intelligence officials. Trump also urged Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison to provide assistance to the Justice Department investigation, according to people familiar with the matter.
In Italy, people familiar with the matter said, Barr asked intelligence officials about Joseph Mifsud, a mysterious European professor whose conversation with an adviser to Trump's 2016 campaign helped launch the FBI investigation into possible coordination with Russia.
Some conservatives have adopted an unproven theory that Mifsud was working to set up the Trump campaign when he boasted to campaign adviser George Papadopoulos about having "dirt" on Hillary Clinton in the form of "thousands of emails" - before Russia's hacking of Democrats was publicly known. When the FBI learned of that conversation some months later, it opened a case.
Papadopoulos has asserted Mifsud is "an Italian intelligence asset who the CIA weaponized." Italian officials, though, told Barr they had no involvement in the matter.
In May, Trump ordered U.S. intelligence agencies to cooperate with the Justice Department's examination of the Russia probe. Durham has interviewed some of those involved in the investigation - though he has not yet talked to many who would seem to be major players.
Former CIA director John Brennan told NBC News recently that Durham had expressed his intent to interview him and a number of other current and former intelligence officials involved in the Russia case, including former director of national intelligence James R. Clapper Jr.
Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz, meanwhile, has completed his investigation of the Russia case, and his report is being reviewed by Barr and others to determine what can be released publicly. On Thursday, Horowitz notified lawmakers that review was "nearing completion" and he did not expect to need to produce both a classified and unclassified version of his report.
How Horowitz's probe dovetailed with Durham's was not immediately clear. Often the inspectors general will refer their work to federal prosecutors to conduct their own inquiries to determine whether any crimes have been committed.

DeVos-appointed official resigns, calls for sweeping student loan forgiveness

Texto completo: Arthur Wayne Johnson, appointed by Education Secretary Betsy DeVos to a top post in the federal government's trillion-dollar financial aid operations, resigned Thursday, calling the student loan system "fundamentally broken" and urging the elimination of millions of Americans' student debt.
The departure of Johnson, who said he will seek a U.S. Senate seat in Georgia, arrives as House Democrats ramp up their investigation of the role Education Department officials, including Johnson, played in helping Dream Center Education Holdings. Dream Center operated the defunct for-profit chain Argosy University and the Art Institutes. The House Education and Labor Committee has requested an interview with Johnson, DeVos and the department's head of higher education policy, Diane Auer Jones.
Johnson became chief operating officer of the Office of Federal Student Aid in 2017, but he was reassigned to a deputy role several months later, charged with overhauling the Education Department's handling of student loan payments.
He said his time at the department made it "crystal clear . . . that the system is fundamentally broken."
"When . . . somebody has $40,000 in student loan debt and, because of forbearances or deferments and the accrual of interest, they wind up with $120,000, you have to step back and say this is fundamentally broken," Johnson said. "You have no idea how proud I am of what we've done to make the existing process better . . . but we're making a broken system better."
Johnson, who has never run for office, is seeking to fill out the term of retiring senator Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.). Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp (R) plans to appoint an interim senator until a special election next year.
Johnson said if he becomes a federal lawmaker, he would advocate forgiving up to $50,000 in federal student loan debt, a proposal that would wipe away the balances of roughly 37 million borrowers. People who have repaid their student loans would receive a tax credit of up to $50,000.
On the front end, Johnson would provide students with a $50,000 grant to attend public or private colleges or pursue a vocational credential. He said if the government is making substantial grants to students, there is no need to make loans. Johnson said the federal government is not "qualified to be in the consumer loan business."
The program would be funded with a 1 percent tax on revenue generated by all employers. It would cost about $140 billion a year.
"When you look at who consumes higher education, it's actually corporations . . . because they are the ones setting the markers, in terms of what somebody is expected to have achieved to pass through their gates," Johnson said. "If I'm a corporation, I'm willing to invest in training people and I certainly should be willing to invest in helping them get trained up to work with me."
Johnson's plan bears a striking resemblance to the student debt-forgiveness plan proposed by Democratic presidential contender Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), which calls for forgiving up to $50,000 in student debt for borrowers with an annual household income of less than $100,000. Johnson would not impose an income cap.
His support of loan forgiveness starkly contrasts with DeVos, who recently bashed liberal lawmakers for their debt cancellation proposals. In a Fox News appearance last week, DeVos said, "Their proposals are crazy. . . . Who do they think is actually going to pay for these? It's going to be two of the three Americans that aren't going to college paying for the one out of three that do."
Johnson praised DeVos, saying she always has students' and taxpayers' best interests at heart. He said she was supportive of his ideas to overhaul the federal student loan program, a project dubbed Next Generation Financial Services Environment, or NextGen. Johnson said he is proud of work he did creating a mobile app for the federal financial aid application to make it easier for students to complete the form.
Johnson also spearheaded a pilot program to manage credit balances, the money left over when a student's financial aid award exceeds tuition and fees owed to their schools. The program disbursed the money on a debit card without fees. Consumer groups expressed concerns when First Data, which employed Johnson 25 years ago, was selected as one of three payment card providers.
Addressing the concerns, Johnson said he had no role in awarding contracts for the project. He said he intentionally created a "firewall" to avoid conflicts of interest.
The Education Department informed student aid staff of Johnson's resignation Thursday, which was first reported by the Wall Street Journal. In an office-wide email, obtained by The Washington Post, Mark A. Brown, chief operating officer in the student aid office, thanked Johnson for "candid advice, mentorship, and support."
House Democrats say Johnson helped facilitate Dream Center's request for funding from an account managed by the Education Department. The money was supposed to cover losses on student loans if the company ceased to operate, but Dream Center wanted to use some of it to wind down academic programs at campuses slated to close.
In October 2018, Dream Center attorney Dennis Cariello sent an email to company executives ahead of a meeting with Johnson. Cariello wrote, in the email obtained by House Democrats, that Johnson "asked that I review the draw requests - there are a few things we can't have in there - bonuses . . . and future rental payments."
Cariello could not immediately be reached for comment. The New York Times first reported that email.
The Education Department released about $40 million from the account to Dream Center. House Democrats call it a waste of taxpayer funds, especially because the money could have been used to cancel student loans when the colleges abruptly closed this year.
On Thursday, Johnson said he was not aware of the committee's request to interview him and insisted it was not his decision to release the funds.
"If I am invited to talk with them, I am willing to do so," he said. "I was not involved in the release of any funds."

OPIOID LEGISLATION SIGNED A YEAR AGO TODAY: The president signed legislation to fight the opioid crisis a year ago. Elected officials would like to see the government go even further in offering relief to communities that are struggling.
There were encouraging signs that overdose deaths began falling last year for the first time since 1990, but it’s still too soon to tell whether that represented a blip or a turnaround in overall trends. The death toll was 47,590 in 2018.
Congress passed two other bills in recent years, aside from last year’s SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act. The latest legislation came with $8.5 billion in funding, but several presidential candidates, including Elizabeth Warren, Amy Klobuchar, and Beto O’Rourke just this morning, have called for pouring upwards of $100 billion over 10 years to fight the crisis. Bernie Sanders thinks drug company executives should face jail time, and other candidates have said companies should be fined out of business.
With Congress’ healthcare agenda focused on drug pricing and surprise medical bills, there has been less talk about opioids. Meanwhile, there’s major litigation underway that would help communities combat the crisis.
Thursday morning, Republican Greg Walden released a list of a dozen bills he’d like to see passed.
They include measures to provide more oversight regarding where prescription drugs are sold and letting certain treatment facilities use telemedicine to help patients.
Walden also wants to give doctors access to more medical records so they can see if a patient is on an opioid or has a history of addiction. There’s a proposed rule to do this through the Trump administration, but Congress could codify it.

DRUG PRICING BILL WON’T GET A VOTE NEXT WEEK AFTER ALL: We’ve confirmed with a senior Democratic aide that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s bill to negotiate drug prices won’t be taken up for a floor vote until the next work period, which would be sometime in mid-November.
VERMA STONEWALLS HOUSE DEMOCRATS ABOUT OBAMACARE REPLACEMENT PLAN: Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Seema Verma faced tough questioning from Democrats on a House oversight panel Wednesday about what the Trump administration would do if the Affordable Care Act were to be ruled unconstitutional. Several Democrats tried to glean information about a supposed replacement plan from Verma, but she only said: “I’m not going to get into any specifics of the plan but the president’s agenda on healthcare has been in action from day one… We have planned for a number of different scenarios but we need to hear from the courts.”
HOUSE PANEL ADVANCES VAPING TAX PLAN: The House Ways and Means Committee voted 25 to 14 to advance a first-of-its kind bill to impose taxes on nicotine products, including vaping liquids. Democrat Tom Suozzi, the bill’s lead author, said the objective of the bill is to hike up the prices of vaping products, like Juul pods, to the point at which they’re too expensive for young people to buy. The tax would amount to $50.33 per 1,810 mg. For reference, the average Juul pod, with 5% nicotine content and 0.7 mL of liquid, would be taxed at $1.15.
FDA PROPOSES WARNINGS FOR BREAST IMPLANTS: The FDA has proposed using a black box warning, the strictest warning the agency can place on a product that has known risks associated with it, on breast implant packaging.
NIH AND GATES FOUNDATION DEDICATE MILLIONS TO GENE-BASED CURES FOR SICKLE CELL AND HIV: The National Institutes of Health will funnel $100 million into research for gene-based cures for sickle cell disease and HIV. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation is matching the donation. The goal is not only to create cures for both but also to make the cures globally accessible, especially to under-developed nations.
ANTI-ABORTION GROUP LAUNCHES TITLE IX PUSH TO EDUCATE STUDENTS : Students for Life of America launched an education campaign to inform students that Title IX says they may not be discriminated against, including in student housing or scholarships, just because they are pregnant or parenting. The latest move by the organization looks at policies outside of abortion restrictions to encourage women who face an unplanned pregnancy to choose motherhood or adoption.
JUDGE BLOCKS OKLAHOMA ‘ABORTION REVERSAL’ LAW: It was otherwise set to go into effect Nov. 1 and would have obligated doctors to tell women about how to reverse medication abortions. There is no method approved by the FDA to reverse abortions, but anti-abortion groups have encouraged women who change their minds to take repeated doses of progesterone after they take the first of two abortion pills.
SANDERS AND WARREN LEAD PUSH FOR COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTER FUNDING: The presidential candidates, along with Democratic Rep. Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts, led a letter from 85 congressional colleagues asking leaders to boost the five-year extension for the Community Health Center Fund, the National Health Service Corps, and the Teaching Health Center Graduate Medical Education program. The programs are set to expire Nov. 21. Lawmakers who signed the letter want leadership to switch to the more generous package that Sanders has introduced, rather than the current spending bill advancing through Congress.

Texto completo: The Navy SEAL commando force is the stuff of legend, lionized for the raid that killed Osama bin Laden, rescuing an American sea captain from Somali pirates and fighting to the death in the mountains of Afghanistan in the "Lone Survivor" story.
This summer, however, the commander of this vaunted band of war fighters warned about an ethical and professional crisis in the ranks. "We have a problem," Rear Adm. Collin Green wrote in a letter to the troops. "Some of our subordinate formations have failed to maintain good order and discipline and as a result and for good reason, our (Naval Special Warfare) culture is being questioned. "
There was cocaine abuse in a SEAL team based in Virginia. Two SEALs were accused of killing a U. S. soldier in a hazing in North Africa. Another SEAL allegedly raped an American female service member during a drunken party in Iraq.
And then there was the case of Navy SEAL Edward Gallagher.
Fighting Islamic State in Iraq
A combat veteran with the nickname Blade — who said he craved combat and the chance to "kill as many people as possible," according to The New York Times — Gallagher was accused by members of his platoon of battlefield atrocities in Iraq while fighting the Islamic State terrorist group in 2017.
The allegations included shooting Iraqi civilians from a sniper's nest, firing indiscriminately into neighborhoods with a heavy machine gun, and using a custom-made knife to stab a teenage captive to death before posing with the corpse for a photograph.
OPPOSING VIEW: Navy SEALs have a problem, but it's not my client
The Navy was slow to investigate, and the prosecution's case began falling apart even before trial amid concerns about witness intimidation. Gallagher, who had become the darling of right-wing commentators, was acquitted in July on all charges except the one dealing with posing with a dead body.
According to The Times report last week, after Green began worrying about an anti-authority "Gallagher effect" infecting his elite force, an Instagram account belonging to Gallagher and his wife offered T-shirts with the phrase "Gallagher effect" and decried Green and another top leader as "a bunch of morons. " Plans were drawn up to force Gallagher out of the SEALs based on new evidence of misconduct after unauthorized weapons, stolen equipment and illegal drugs were found in Gallagher's home and a work locker.
Then President Donald Trump entered the picture.
'Train our boys to be killing machines'
The commander in chief, who has advocated torture and taken a keen interest in pardoning troops convicted of war crimes, complained in a tweet this month that "we train our boys to be killing machines, then prosecute them when they kill!"
He followed Gallagher's case, even discussing it with senior Navy officials. According to The Times, the Navy was faced with a dilemma: It could kick Gallagher out of the SEALs to help restore good order and discipline, but risk a reversal by Trump that would effectively emasculate SEAL leadership. So no action has been taken. And what Navy leaders most feared has likely come to pass: They've been shown powerless as the Gallagher effect undermines the unit's ethical code that "uncompromising integrity is my standard. My character and honor are steadfast. My word is my bond. "
Last week, former Navy SEAL and retired Adm. William McRaven — the highly respected architect of the bin Laden raid — reflected in a column about America's military ethos.
"The Greatest Generation went to war because it believed that we were the good guys," he wrote. "We are the most powerful nation . . . because we try to be the good guys. "
But with Gallaghers in the ranks and a president in their corner, is the United States still the good guys?

A stamp for our 'forever' Gwen

Texto completo: Imagine that you are an aspiring baseball player. You have spent years honing your craft, working at it every day. You think of yourself as a professional. Perhaps on your home field - whether it's high school, college or the minor leagues - you are even thought of as pretty good. Then one day, unexpectedly, you find yourself in a lineup with someone whose skills dwarf yours. And not by a little. Think Joe DiMaggio of the New York Yankees versus Joe Fatone of NSYNC but without the boy band singing or dancing. I know exactly what that's like. I was there.
Some 36 years ago this month, I was invited by Maryland Public Television to be a panelist on a half-hour local news program with Gwen Ifill. At the time, she was a politics reporter for The Evening Sun. Taped late on Fridays at MPT's Owings Mills studio, the show featured reporters from across the state discussing the week's major events. Similar to "Washington Week" on PBS, each panelist would present a Maryland news story and then the whole group would talk about it. I was then a fledgling reporter for The Star-Democrat in Easton and new to television, but MPT paid a $125 stipend which was roughly equal to half a week's pay, so I was in. I knew I'd be awkward and untrained. Many of my colleagues were the same.
And then there was Gwen.
To suggest Gwen Ifill was a talented reporter is like offering that Mozart was a pretty good composer. She was not only smart and quick-witted, knowledgeable and hardworking and politically savvy, she was incredibly poised on camera. Print reporters aren't normally TV-friendly. Gwen was a star in whatever medium you cared to choose, and anyone could see it instantly.
Before I was even hired by The Sun several years later, her career had already taken off and she left our offices on Calvert Street for greener pastures at The Washington Post and The New York Times and then went on to broadcast journalism, first as a reporter for NBC but eventually as co-anchor and co-managing editor of PBS's "NewsHour" as well as, fittingly, moderator of Washington Week. What viewers across the nation saw on their TV sets was the same superstar I witnessed in the early 1980s in the green room in Owings Mills. Next month, it will be exactly three years since she died of cancer at age 61, a life taken far too soon.
Which brings us to what we call a miserably buried lede, in journalese. The U.S. Postal Service announced this week that Gwen is getting her own commemorative "forever" stamp as part of its Black Heritage series. She is unquestionably deserving. And it appears her selection has more than a little to do with Baltimore as she was recommended by Morgan State University associate professor Wayne Dawkins, a veteran journalist who teaches the next generation of reporters and editors at Morgan. The hope is that the honor will inspire more individuals to pursue a career of truth-seeking, whether it is the glamorous life of interviewing a president on network television or the more mundane job of just trying to get the latest twist or turn of a city mayoral race into the local paper or website. Her place as a breaker of barriers, as an African American woman who achieved the pinnacle of success in her field, was assured long before this day. The stamp is a nice reminder.
But it's more than that. How great, how totally fantastic, how miraculous that at a time when journalists and journalism is under such vicious attack from some of the most powerful political figures in the country, that the Postal Service can give the profession such a tip of the hat. The business of holding the powerful accountable has never been more daunting, at least not in my lifetime. We need more Gwen Ifills, her courage, her smarts, her generosity, her genius. Some of us will never hit for the cycle. We will never pitch a no-hitter. We will never field a triple play or make a leaping catch in center field to save a game. But we can damn well recognize those who do and cheer when they take the field - and when they leave it. Thanks, USPS, for elevating Gwen, her role in the struggle for equal rights and her outstanding journalism. You really delivered this time.

Texto completo: Gwen Ifill, a Simmons University alumna, groundbreaking journalist, and PBS “NewsHour" host who died in 2016, will be honored with a Forever Stamp, according to the Postal Service.
A photograph of Ifill will be featured on the 43rd stamp in the Black Heritage series. The stamp was designed by Postal Service art director Derry Noyes and features a 2008 photograph taken by Robert Severi.
“Among the first African- Americans to hold prominent positions in both broadcast and print journalism, Ifill was a trailblazer in the profession," the USPS said in a statement.
Ifill covered the White House, Congress, and national campaigns during three decades for The Washington Post, The New York Times, and NBC.
In 2013, she was named coanchor of PBS “NewsHour" with Judy Woodruff. They were the first all-female anchor team on network news.
Ifill got her communication degree from Simmons in 1977 and was the school's commencement speaker in 2009.

Gaetz leads protest over impeachment inquiry

Texto completo: U.S. Rep. Matt Gaetz led more than 30 Republican lawmakers to "crash" the impeachment inquiry hearings against President Donald Trump at the Capitol on Wednesday, causing the hearing to be halted for several hours.
The GOP lawmakers were protesting the closed-door nature of the hearings, which are being conducted by the House Intelligence, Foreign Affairs, and Oversight and Reform committees in a room known as a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility, or SCIF, in the basement of the Capitol.
Gaetz had previously tried to sit in on a hearing last week and was kicked out as he was not on one of the three committees conducting the inquiry. Republicans who are on any of the three committees are allowed to attend the impeachment inquiry hearings.
On Wednesday, Gaetz organized a press conference that became another attempt to enter the hearings. Close to 30 lawmakers — most of them not on any of the three committees — stood behind Gaetz as he told reporters that the group was going to try to enter the SCIF.
Gaetz previously called a press conference for last week, but it was canceled following the death of Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md.
"We're going to try to go in there, and we're going to try to figure out what's going on behalf of the millions of Americans that we represent that want to see this Congress working for them, and not obsessed with attacking a president who we believe has not done anything to deserve impeachment," Gaetz said at press conference he streamed on social media.
Department of Defense official Laura Cooper, who serves as the deputy assistant secretary of Defense for Russia, Ukraine, and Eurasia, was testifying at the time, but the hearing was halted as Republicans entered the room.
The protest came a day after Bill Taylor, the top U.S. diplomat to Ukraine, said in his opening statement, according to the Associated Press, that he was "alarmed" Trump was withholding the release of military aid for Ukraine until the country opened an investigation into an energy company that employed former Vice President Joe Biden's son, Hunter.
Democrats accuse Republicans of violating House rules The New York Times reported that Rep. Adam Schiff, who is leading the inquiry, called the sergeant-at-arms to clear the protest by the Republican lawmakers.
Rep. Mike Quigley, D-Ill., told reporters that Cooper's testimony was temporarily halted because of the protest but would continue.
Rep. Ted Lieu, D-Calif., said Republicans were trying to enter a secure area while carrying electronics, which is not allowed, and despite not being members of the three committees.
"They also brought in their cellphones, which is a violation, they violated House rules by trying to crash committees," Lieu said.
Rep. Tim Burchett, R-N.C., said none of the Republican lawmakers who interrupted the hearing took photos inside the SCIF.
"That would be illegal," he said.
Gaetz told reporters he intended to find out what was happening at the hearing.
"Behind those doors, if they intend to overturn the results of a president election, we want to know what's going on," Gaetz said at the press conference.

Texto completo: NEW YORK - As Lupita Nyong'o accepted an award from the Harlem School of Arts - and entered the stage to Beyonce's anthemic hit "Brown Skin Girl" - the actress mainly had two people to thank for fueling her passion for the arts as a child: her parents.
"I was thinking about (the Harlem School of Arts) and what it does for children and its students (and) I didn't have an institution where I'm from in Nairobi, Kenya. And so the only way my interest in the arts thrived was because I had parents who valued those interests," she said Monday night at the school's annual Mask Ball in New York City. "And my mother in particular, she really nurtured my artistic spirit."
The Oscar winner's mother, Dorothy, also received the Visionary Lineage Award alongside her daughter.
"I really didn't do much," Dorothy Nyong'o said to laughs from the audience. Dorothy Nyong'o said she noticed her daughter's interest in the arts as a child and so she looked "for opportunities to nurture that."
"My job was really to facilitate it, and I'd like to encourage parents to do it. Sometimes we make the mistake of trying to make our children what we think we want," she said.
Dorothy Nyong'o won over the audience with more sweet words for her daughter, who has appeared in films such as "Black Panther," "Star Wars," "Us" and "12 Years a Slave," for which she won an Oscar.
"I'm proud of her. She makes me shine."
Lupita Nyong'o, 36, thanked her mom for all of her support, explaining that when she was a teenager, her mother "drove to rehearsals after a long day at work" and sat "in the car for five or so hours and she never complained."

Married Minaj: Ms. Nicki Minaj wants you to know she's now officially Mrs. Petty. Minaj - who has dated Kenneth Petty for about a year - seems to confirm her marriage with a video on Instagram that shows off Mr. and Mrs. coffee mugs and bride and groom hats. She also changed her Twitter name to Mrs. Petty. The couple first dated as teenagers and reunited last year.
Book him: Former acting solicitor general of the U.S. and MSNBC commentator Neal Katyal has written "Impeach: The Case Against Donald Trump." The book, co-written with Sam Koppelman, comes out Nov. 26. Last month, Katyal wrote a New York Times op-ed piece in which he condemned Trump's "brazen conduct" and said impeachment was warranted even if he didn't commit an actual crime.
Snoop Dogg-endorsed: An Israeli start-up that promotes home-grown marijuana says it has signed on rapper Snoop Dogg as a brand ambassador. Snoop, an outspoken advocate of marijuana use, will promote Seedo's small refrigeratorlike machine that grows plants with the help of artificial intelligence. Snoop said that promoting a product that enables people to grow plants in unused urban spaces "is something I'm all the way down with." Snoop started his own line of marijuana products, Leafs by Snoop, in 2015.

Top Democrat floats SEAL admiral William McRaven for 2020

Texto completo: Elaine Kamarck, a member of the Democratic National Committee and a 2016 superdelegate, said retired Admiral William McRaven could be a good candidate to run against President Trump.
As Democrats struggle to find a 2020 candidate and different names are being floated, Kamarck told the Washington Post that an outsider like the 63-year-old McRaven, who oversaw the 2011 raid that killed Osama bin Laden, might be a good move.
“You can imagine much stronger candidates,” Kamarck, who has been a member of the DNC since 1997, said of the current slate of candidates.
The comment comes just days after McRaven published an op-ed in the New York Times with the headline “Our Republic Is Under Attack From the President,” where he admonished Trump’s leadership.
He noted “assaults on our institutions,” including the State Department, intelligence officials, law enforcement, and the press.
“They have seen our leaders stand beside despots and strongmen, preferring their government narrative to our own. They have seen us abandon our allies and have heard the shouts of betrayal from the battlefield,” McRaven said.
“If this president doesn’t demonstrate the leadership that America needs, both domestically and abroad, then it is time for a new person in the Oval Office — Republican, Democrat or Independent — the sooner, the better,” he said. “The fate of our Republic depends upon it.”
McRaven was commander of the United States Special Operations Command from 2011 to 2014 and commander of Joint Special Operations Command from 2008 to 2011.
Democratic front-runner Joe Biden, 76, has struggled with worries relating to his age and has had issues with his memory on the campaign trail. Bernie Sanders, 78, also recently had a heart attack, also prompting age-related concerns.
Both Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, who has been on the rise, have raised worries among some in the party that they are too liberal to beat Trump in a general election campaign, while other more moderate candidates have failed to gain traction in national and state polling.
Other names being floated as possible late additions to the field include former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg.
The Washington Examiner reached out to McRaven for comment but did not immediately receive a response.

Subpoena Amos Hochstein to get to the bottom of Burisma Holdings and Trump's quid pro quo

Texto completo: A shocking new report further corroborates Ambassador William Taylor's testimony that Ukrainian President Zelensky knew of President Trump's withholding of military aid, conditioned on a personal political favor. The Associated Press claims that in between Zelensky's election and inauguration, he met with advisers in Kyiv to plan how to avoid becoming entangled in American elections. Based on conversations with three sources familiar with the May 7 meeting, the AP reports:
The full details of what the two leaders discussed in that Easter Sunday phone call have never been publicly disclosed, and it is not clear whether Trump explicitly asked for an investigation of the Bidens. The three people’s recollections differ on whether Zelenskiy specifically cited that first call with Trump as the source of his unease. But their accounts all show the Ukrainian president-elect was wary of Trump’s push for an investigation into the former vice president and his son Hunter’s business dealings.
Seeing as how the AP gives no further detail, the report itself makes it impossible to say whether Zelensky's fear, however well-founded in hindsight, was based on any actions or communications with the Trump administration at the time. But there was one person in the room for that conversation whom Congress has the authority to subpoena: Amos Hochstein, an American supervisory board member of Ukrainian natural gas company Naftogaz and a former Obama administration energy diplomat with ties to the Bidens.
If Hochstein's name sounds familiar, it's because you may recognize it from the lengthy New Yorker expose on Hunter Biden. Back in July, Adam Entous at the magazine wrote of Hochstein:In December, 2015, as Joe Biden prepared to return to Ukraine, his aides braced for renewed scrutiny of Hunter’s relationship with Burisma. Amos Hochstein, the Obama Administration’s special envoy for energy policy, raised the matter with Biden, but did not go so far as to recommend that Hunter leave the board.
Hochstein also advised Biden directly on Ukraine matters during his tenure as Special Envoy and Coordinator of International Energy Affairs during the Obama administration.
As an American citizen, Hochstein is the only person from the meeting in the AP piece whom Congress has the undisputed authority to subpoena. Not only could he testify to the question of impropriety with regards to the Bidens and Burisma, but he could also provide key details about the Zelensky meeting. Even more importantly, he could explain the events that precipitated it and instigated Zelensky's fears.
Rudy Giuliani, the president's personal attorney and the leader of the secondary back channel that operated outside of the purview of Trump's formal diplomats, tweeted about a "DNC conspiracy" with Ukraine on April 23, exactly two weeks before the Kyiv meeting with Hochstein.TweetThe New York Times reported on May 9, two days after the meeting, that Giuliani was "plan[nning]" a trip to Ukraine. In that light, it's possible that Zelensky was simply scared by Giuliani's tweet and Trump's interview with Sean Hannity in which he suggested that Attorney General Bill Barr ought to look into Ukraine. But was it something else? Was there any direct line of communication between Trump's camp and the Ukrainians that gave Zelensky enough pause that he was planning how to circumvent Trump's eventual quid pro quo before he was even sworn into office?
Hochstein is the only American who knows for certain, and he can provide goods for both Republican and Democratic interests. Maybe the Biden connection to Burisma was deeply corrupt, and maybe Trump's threats went back further than the summer. But it's hard for us to determine without Hochstein's testimony. Sunlight is the best disinfectant, and both parties ought to bring in Hochstein to elucidate the truth.

Frank Bruni: Is God skipping the Democratic primary?

Autor: Bruni, Frank. 

Información de publicación: The Salt Lake Tribune ; Salt Lake City, Utah [Salt Lake City, Utah]. 23 Oct 2019.

Texto completo: The most recent Democratic debate lasted three hours and, according to one transcript I checked, exceeded 30,000 words.
Almost none of them were about religion.
God came up only in throwaway phrases. “God bless Kamala,” said Cory Booker, praising Kamala Harris for discussing reproductive rights. Joe Biden scattered “for God’s sake” and “God forbid” like croutons on his word salads. Tulsi Gabbard, explaining the meaning of “aloha,” noted that “we’re all God’s children.”
When Booker fleetingly mentioned his participation in a bipartisan Bible study group, I snapped to attention. That was the closest the debate came to acknowledging the importance of faith in many people’s lives.
While the percentage of Americans who don’t identify with any religion has grown significantly over the past decade — to 26% from 17%, according to a sweeping survey by the Pew Research Center — it’s still the case that more than half of Americans say that they pray daily and 45% attend religious services at least once a month.
But you wouldn’t know it to tune into the Democratic primary.
If many Republican candidates travel far out of their way, toward the bogs of histrionics and hypocrisy, to recruit the Almighty into electoral service, many Democrats steer clear of religion. That’s partly understandable, even admirable: In light of the rightful separation of church and state, they don’t want to be seen as spotlighting or peddling any one creed.
But it’s not necessary, and it’s not smart.
President Donald Trump and his Republican allies are poised to paint Democrats as unhinged lefties not only in terms of health care and taxes but also in terms of cultural issues, including abortion and LGBTQ rights.
And some Democratic presidential candidates are already playing into their hands. Beto O’Rourke, for example, recently seemed to call for religious groups that don’t support marriage equality to lose their tax-exempt status, an outlier position that the president immediately seized on and railed against. (O’Rourke’s aides later insisted that he was misunderstood.)
Democrats would make it harder for Trump to vilify them as enemies of so-called traditional values if they talked a bit more about spirituality and religion — including, if applicable, their own.
That might not matter in the bluest parts of the bluest states, said Mike McCurry, a Democratic consultant who served as the White House press secretary under President Bill Clinton and now teaches at the Wesley Theological Seminary in Washington. But, he added, “I sure as hell believe that it would work in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, and that’s what it’s all going to come down to.”
The church-state divide shouldn’t dissuade the candidates, McCurry told me. “That’s such a misreading of what the political DNA of America is,” he said. “We have had religion woven into our political structures and our political debate from the very beginning.”
Besides, he added, a Democrat who speaks persuasively about religion has a potentially huge tactical advantage: “Think ahead to the general election. If you’re talking about faith in an authentic, genuine way, imagine the contrast if you’re running against Donald Trump, who has absolutely none of that vocabulary.” While the president may have the farthest reaches of the religious right locked down, many Americans of faith are appalled by him.
And he’s vulnerable not just because of his personal history and public demeanor, which amount to a raging bonfire of the pieties. He also has governed in ways that contradict the principles of charity and mercy that are central to many religions.
Pete Buttigieg took gorgeously effective note of this in the Democrats’ first debate, in June, referring to the Trump administration’s treatment of migrants at the border.
“The Republican Party likes to cloak itself in the language of religion,” he observed. “But we should call out hypocrisy when we see it.” And any political party that suggests that “God would smile on the division of families at the hands of federal agents — that God would condone putting children in cages — has lost all claim to ever use religious language again.”
Buttigieg, a churchgoing Episcopalian, refuses to cede religion to Republicans or let them use it as some crude moral cudgel. He weaves it into discussions of his marriage to another man. “Nothing has made me feel more connected, more able to be true, however imperfectly, to my faith than the experience of putting myself second,” he said at a CNN town hall this month. “That came with committing my life to my husband, Chasten.”
He’s not the only Democratic presidential candidate with religion in his history and on his mind. He’s just unusual in his readiness to mention it.
In the Democratic debates, Elizabeth Warren, a Methodist, has repeatedly reflected on her past as a teacher. But she has never taken the few extra syllables to note that she taught Sunday school.
In terms of connecting with as much of the electorate as possible, that’s a mistake. And in terms of the president’s moral fluency, it’s a blown opportunity.

¿Por qué capturaron y soltaron al Ovidio Guzmán, el hijo de ‘El Chapo’? Circulan varias versiones

Texto completo: Más allá de la versión oficial, han florecido múltiples las hipótesis sobre lo que pasó con la captura efímera de Ovidio Guzmán López, el hijo de “El Chapo “. Tras su aprehensión el 17 de octubre, un grupo de civiles fuertemente armados salieron al rescate de Guzmán López. Y lo consiguieron.
En las horas que duró la detención del narcotraficante, la violencia se apoderó de las calles de Culiacán, Sinaloa (México) y dejó alrededor de 13 muertos. Después de la puesta en libertad, los medios empezaron a hacerse eco de lo que ocurrió a lanzar versiones diferentes.
El gobierno justificó su decisión diciendo que quería evitar una “masacre” en Culiacán ya que los militares se habían precipitado , eran pocos y carecían de una orden de cateo. Según cuenta Univision, el ejecutivo mexicano la ofensiva del cartel de Sinaloa -cuyo bastión es Culiacán- rebasó en poco tiempo al ejército y grupos de sicarios acudieron a las afueras de un complejo residencial donde viven familiares de los soldados para amenazar al gobierno.
El presidente, Andrés Manuel López Obrador , dijo en una de sus “mañaneras” que no se arrepiente de su gestión ante el conflicto ya que, en sus propias palabras, “nosotros no vamos a optar nunca por la guerra, por la confrontación o por el uso de la fuerza. Lo que nos importa es la vida de las personas”. “Yo tengo mi conciencia tranquila y sé que actuamos de manera correcta”, aseguró el mandatario.
Se barajan al menos cuatro razones detrás de los hechos que ocurrieron en Culiacán el 17 de octubre:
1. La intervención de ‘El Mayo’ Zambada es una de las versiones que han citado medios que no creen que la célula criminal de Ovidio Guzmán haya actuado sola. Según esta hipótesis, el capo Ismael ‘El Mayo’ Zambada, que lleva más de tres décadas al frente la organización criminal, ayudó a coordinar las acciones violentas que forzaron al Gobierno a replegar el ejército . Además, el exagente de la DEA Jack Riley dijo al semanario Proceso que es posible que Zambada haya impedido la detención de otro miembro de los Guzmán. J. Jesús Esquivel, experto en narcotráfico de esta misma revista, aseguró que “en Culiacán y en ningún lugar de Sinaloa se mueve un dedo sin la bendición y autorización de […] ‘El Mayo’ Zambada.
2. El periodista de The New York Times, Alan Freuer, dijo en Twitter que, además de a Ovidio, los militares también arrestaron a su hermano Iván Archivaldo . De acuerdo con esta versión, Archivaldo conseguiría primero la libertad y se encargaría de dirigir la ofensiva que acabaría en la liberación de Ovidio Guzmán . Para conseguirlo, Freuer comenta que habrían secuestrado a familiares de los soldados.
3. El ejército mexicano insiste, según Univision, en que sus soldados solo rodearon la vivienda en la que se encontraba Ovidio pero “nunca estuvo formalmente detenido . Sin embargo, un audio viral de un supuesto militar contradice la versión oficial afirmando que “cumplimos con el objetivo de detener a un delincuente”. “Se estima que eran entre 700 y 800 delincuentes -continúa el audio-. Solo 350 de nosotros le hicimos frente”. Esta grabación, adelanta Univision, aún no se ha confirmado.
4. El diario The Wall Street Journal informó de que los soldados bajaron las armas porque, entre los videos que recibieron, uno muestra como rehenes a los miembros de una patrulla . En otro se ve a un soldado ejecutado con un disparo en la cabeza, según dijo un exfuncionario al citado diario. Por otro lado, Marcelo Erbrard, canciller mexicano, reconoció que miembros del crimen organizado se colocaron el jueves frente a viviendas de familiares del ejército esperando la orden para abrir fuego.

Texto completo: In 2016, when the Washington Nationals were playing the Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League Division Series, Juliet Macur suggested in a New York Times column that D.C., a football town, was beginning “to look an awful lot like an up-and-coming baseball town.”
She asked what I thought, since I had written a history of baseball in Washington, and I replied, “Sure, I think baseball could someday become football’s equal here. But I don’t see it ever superseding football. Well, maybe in 50 years.”
I was off by 47 years. It’s now clear to me that Washington has turned into a full-throttle baseball town, and the Nats have eclipsed the Washington Redskins in the hearts of Washingtonians. It’s not just that this will be the Nats’ first World Series appearance, and the city’s first since 1933. An equally important factor is all the negative energy from the football club - the poor product, the empty seats, the controversy over the team name and the unpopularity of owner Daniel Snyder.
Meanwhile, anyone who attended either of the Nats’ two home victories over the St. Louis Cardinals last week could feel that the energy level had been ramped up to 11 at Nationals Park. The stadium convulsed in a way that it rarely, if ever, had before.
When baseball returned here in 2005, the idea that the sport would wrest the top spot from football was implausible. The city had no baseball for 33 years, so an entire generation grew up without a local team. And when the Expos limped here from Montreal, a castoff franchise owned by Major League Baseball, they didn’t have a foundation. The Nats finished last in five of their first six seasons and had back-to-back seasons of more than 100 losses.
Shortly after the second incarnation of the Washington Senators left town in 1971, the Redskins became an NFL powerhouse. Under coach George Allen, they made several playoff appearances and won an NFC championship in the mid-70s. Then over a decade-long stretch, the team appeared in four Super Bowls, winning three, with Joe Gibbs as coach.
But the Redskins, 1-6, are headed to their third straight losing season and haven’t played in a Super Bowl since 1992. Last season, Redskins attendance dropped a whopping 19%, the worst decline in the NFL. In June 2018, the team announced that a season ticket waiting list it had once claimed ran to 200,000 people no longer existed.
The Nats’ attendance is up nearly 24% since 2010.
This was a baseball town before, after all. The Redskins didn’t arrive from Boston until 1937, around the time the Washington Senators began their descent beyond mediocrity.
In June 1924, after the Senators (also known as the Nationals) swept a four-game series against the defending World Series champion New York Yankees to take over first place in the American League, fans jammed into Union Station to welcome the team home. Later that season, as the Senators marched to their first pennant, the Washington Evening Star declared, using the old two-word spelling, “Base ball in the National Capital no longer is a national game. It is a disease, a flaming epidemic, and if something doesn’t happen soon to ease the strain on the faithful fans, half the population of the District of Columbia will be dead of heart failure.” Nats fans can identify.
When the Senators clinched the pennant that year, 100,000 people jammed Pennsylvania Avenue for a parade. At the Ellipse, President Calvin Coolidge joked: “When the entire population reached the point of requiring the game to be described play-by-play, I began to doubt whether the highest efficiency was being promoted.”
The Senators went on to play the New York Giants in the World Series, and for the games at the Polo Grounds, they would follow the action on mechanical scoreboards in Washington or watch U.S. Marines pantomime the games based on wire transmissions from New York.
The Senators beat the Giants to claim the city’s only World Series title. The team won pennants again in 1925 and 1933, but lost the World Series both times.
The same fervor is back. Tuesday night, Nats fans were at their home ballpark to follow the team, this time by watching a TV broadcast on the stadium scoreboard. A few thousand die-hards attended a watch party at Nationals Park to see the team defeat the Dodgers in the fifth and decisive game of this year’s NLDS.
The next day, I saw a woman schlepping a giant Nats flag onto a Metrobus. She told me she bought it at Walmart and brought it to the office, where people were excited to see it.
By bringing the World Series to this city for the first time in 86 years, the Nats have linked themselves to an era when Washington was a baseball town. And in the process, they’ve helped make it one once again.

Harold Bloom dreamed in Yiddish until his death

Texto completo: Many obituaries of Harold Bloom, the lion of American literary criticism who passed away on Oct. 14 at 89, mention that he was born to Orthodox Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe.
Few mention his lifelong love of Yiddish, and particularly Yiddish theater, which he grew up watching in New York City (although The New York Times one does say that the first book Bloom read was an anthology of Yiddish poetry).
In what was likely one of Bloom's last interviews, taped only a few weeks before his death, he spoke with the Yiddish Book Center for its Wexler Oral History Project. The project has shared some of the highlights and video from the interview with the Jewish Telegraphic Agency.
"I still dream in Yiddish"
"As a very small child, 3, 4 years old, I was sent to Sholem Aleichem schools ... they were all over the Bronx. So, pretty good early education that was strictly in Yiddish ... But to this day my English is very curious because I learned it only through the eye and not through the ear. I didn't, in fact, hear English spoken until I was about 5 1/2. I was a preternaturally early reader and at 5 or 6, I was already reading Shakespeare and trying to read Milton and so on. But English is, of course, a very peculiar language, as Bernard Shaw complains, the orthography and the pronunciation have nothing in common. So to this day, I speak my own curious, inflected English. It doesn't sound like anybody else's. So as far as I'm concerned, I still dream in Yiddish."
On whether he still read Yiddish
"Of course. Jabotinsky did a [Yiddish] version of Dante. I've been writing about Dante recently, and reading it in the Italian. I looked at Jabotinsky's [Yiddish] translation, which is very strange. A very strange man, Jabotinsky. But there's a sadness in all of it because I doubt that there's one Jew alive today in Odessa."
"The first book I ever owned was a New Testament in Yiddish"
"Funnily enough, the first book I ever owned myself, and it still strikes me as hilarious, was a New Testament in Yiddish. One day, the doorbell rang and a missionary handed it to me. So I read it years later, since I became a classics major at Cornell. We spent a semester reading the New Testament. Even as a child, I conceived a dislike of it, which I've made clear many times, saying that indeed it should be called the Belated Testament and Tanakh [Hebrew Bible] the Original Testament. One of my many ways of making enemies, of whom God knows I have a plethora."
"A lot of the best poetry written in the United States is in Yiddish"
"A lot of the best poetry written in the United States is in Yiddish ... Moyshe-Leyb Halpern in particular, he was an amazing poet. 'The Yiddish Baudelaire,' they called him, but he's not at all like Baudelaire. He is quite unique ... The humor. Violently funny. The mastery of the language. Unfortunately, he was dead before my time. I knew [Jacob] Glatstein pretty well. He was not as unlikable as [Isaac] Bashevis [Singer], but he wasn't a very sweet person."
"The first Shakespeare plays I ever saw were in Yiddish"
"My three wonderful older sisters steadily took me to the Second Avenue Theater. Unfortunately, Thomashefsky and Jacob Adler were already gone, but Maurice Schwartz was there. The first Shakespeare plays I ever saw were in Yiddish at the Second Avenue Theater and I will never forget my experience. This is about 1938 and I'm 8 years old. The magnificent Maurice Schwartz is Shylock. But this has all been marvelously rewritten, in Yiddish - as they said, 'farbesert' - improved.
"Schwartz was an enormous man. He had a gigantic black beard and a big booming voice, and he played the histrionic old Russian style, like Jacob Adler and Thomashefsky. So there he is, waiving an enormous scalpel, and he's approaching Antonio, the trembling 'sheygetz' [rascal], who is stripped to the waist and suddenly with a histrionic shudder that you could feel all through the Second Avenue Theater, Maurice Schwartz drops the scalpel and screams out 'Ikh bin dokh a yid,' which is of course untranslatable. It's like - well, after all I'm Jewish and we don't do this sort of thing. At which, the play stopped and I got used to this at the Second Avenue Theater. Everybody in the audience cheered. Schwartz ran from one side of the stage to the other, interrupting the performance, bowing and throwing kisses to the women in the audience. Women dashed forward throwing roses at him. It became a sort of general tumult. It was 20 minutes before the play could resume. I loved it."
"'Death of a Salesman' ... works beautifully as a Yiddish tragedy"
"I never thought much of 'Death of a Salesman' until an actor with whom I was close, Joseph Buloff, translated it into Yiddish and acted the part of Willy Loman, and he invited me to see it in New York. It was marvelous. The whole point is it works beautifully as a Yiddish tragedy, but makes no sense as an American tragedy. But in Yiddish as rendered by Buloff and acted by Buloff, it had real power."
On describing Yiddish culture
"My favorite Yiddish proverb I translate, 'Sleep faster, we need the pillows.' That's the essence of it. Compassionate, and conducting a kind of implicit quarrel with God. Remember the great statement of Benya Krik in Babel's great story 'How It Was In Odessa'? After his hoods have shot this highly meek and gentle Jewish clerk, a mother is complaining. And Benya says, magnificently, 'All right, so I made a mistake. Even God makes mistakes. He could have put us in Switzerland surrounded by nothing but thousands of lakes and millions of Frenchies, but where did he put us? Here, in godforsaken Russia.'"

Boeing Ousts Executive At Forefront Of Jet Crisis

Texto completo: Boeing ousted one of its top executives on Tuesday, the most significant management change the airplane maker has made as it struggles to contain the crisis following the crashes of two 737 Max jets that killed 346 people.
The executive, Kevin McAllister, was the head of Boeing's commercial airplanes division. He had been at the center of the company's response to the crashes and its troubled efforts to return the Max to service after regulators grounded it. This month, The New York Times reported that he was under scrutiny inside the company for his poor handling of relationships with airlines, and his management of the commercial division, which is Boeing's largest business.
The ouster was Boeing's most direct effort to hold someone in senior leadership accountable for the bungled handling of the Max crisis, which continues to spiral out of control. The company's board stopped short of removing Boeing's chief executive, Dennis A. Muilenburg, though it stripped him of his title of chairman just over a week ago.
The decision to remove Mr. McAllister was made while the Boeing board met in San Antonio on Monday. With directors and senior executives gathered for tense meetings at the plant where the company builds Air Force One, Boeing's stock took a beating. Two analysts issued downgrades and shares plummeted to their lowest level in more than three months.
The management change adds an element of volatility to the biggest crisis in the company's 103-year-history. The Max jets have been grounded since March, costing Boeing at least $ 8 billion and roiling the global aviation industry.
The company is also facing intense pressure from lawmakers in Washington. On Friday, messages became public that suggested a pilot involved in the development of the Max had voiced concerns about the automated system in 2016, months before the Federal Aviation Administration certified the plane. That system, known as MCAS, was found to have played a role in the accidents.
Those messages are expected to be of central importance when Mr. Muilenburg testifies before Congress next week. Lawmakers have spent the last several days hammering the company and its board for failing to hold anyone accountable for mistakes that may have contributed to the two crashes.
"If nothing else, it gives Dennis Muilenburg something to point to when he is on the Hill," Richard Aboulafia, vice president for analysis at the Teal Group, a consulting firm, said of Mr. McAllister's departure. "People are calling for action. Rightly or wrongly, he can point to this as a form of action."
Inside Boeing, Mr. McAllister faced criticism for alienating important customers and for the cascading series of delays that has kept the Max grounded for more than seven months.
The commercial division is dealing with a raft of issues beyond the Max. They include claims of shoddy production at Boeing's plant in Charleston, S.C.; cracking on the 737 NG, the Max's predecessor; and the discovery of foreign objects inside the KC-46 tanker, a military aircraft that the group builds.
"There were several challenging issues in the pipeline beyond the 737 Max problems," said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a professor at the Yale School of Management. "He had too much under his watch that was off target to maintain credibility."
Stanley A. Deal, who had been acting as the head of global services for Boeing, will replace Mr. McAllister immediately. Mr. Deal, who has spent more than three decades at the company, has held several senior roles throughout the company, including at in the commercial airplanes division.
"We're grateful to Kevin for his dedicated and tireless service to Boeing, its customers and its communities during a challenging time, and for his commitment to support this transition," Mr. Muilenburg said in a statement.
Until recently, the Boeing board had resisted shaking up senior management of the company while the Max remains out of service. Several directors also were said to be sympathetic to Mr. McAllister's argument that he had inherited many of the problems his division was dealing with, according to people familiar with the matter.
Mr. McAllister took over the commercial division in November 2016, after much of the development on the Max was completed, but before it was certified by the F.A.A.
Boeing is facing multiple investigations and lawsuits related to the crashes, including a criminal investigation being led by the Department of Justice.
Next week is the one-year anniversary of the first crash, of Lion Air Flight 610 in Indonesia. Boeing reports quarterly earnings on Wednesday, which are expected to show further slumps in sales and profits.
Since the Max's grounding shortly after the second crash, airlines have canceled thousands of flights and lost hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue.
The Max's return to service has been delayed multiple times as Boeing and global regulators have uncovered new problems with the plane. Airlines do not expect the plane to fly again until next year.
Boeing has said that if the delays persist much longer, it may be forced to halt production of the Max. Such a move would represent a drastic setback for the division that Mr. McAllister oversaw, severely disrupting Boeing's enormous manufacturing work force and its vast network of suppliers.
"The Boeing board fully supports these leadership moves," Boeing's chairman, David Calhoun, said in a statement. "Boeing will emerge stronger than ever from its current challenges and the changes we're making throughout Boeing will benefit the flying public well into the future."

Texto completo: Taubman, the Astros' assistant general manager, was said to have shouted at three female reporters while praising pitcher Roberto Osuna, who was suspended for domestic violence last year.
HOUSTON -- Major League Baseball said it would investigate an incident in which a Houston Astros executive was said to have shouted at three female reporters in an "offensive and frightening" manner as he praised the team's closer, Roberto Osuna, who was suspended for domestic violence last year.
In the Astros' clubhouse after their pennant-clinching win over the Yankees on Saturday night, Brandon Taubman, the team's assistant general manager, turned to the female reporters and yelled repeatedly, "Thank God we got Osuna! I'm so glad we got Osuna!," punctuating the second sentence with an expletive, according to a Sports Illustrated column published Monday. The Astros have been criticized heavily for acquiring Osuna last season while he was serving a 75-game suspension for domestic violence.
"Domestic violence is extraordinarily serious and everyone in baseball must use care to not engage in any behavior -- whether intentional or not -- that could be construed as minimizing the egregiousness of an act of domestic violence," M.L.B. said in a statement Tuesday. "We became aware of this incident through the Sports Illustrated article. The Astros have disputed Sports Illustrated's characterization of the incident. MLB will interview those involved before commenting further."
After the column was published, reporters from other news outlets -- including Yahoo Sports and The Houston Chronicle -- said on Twitter that they had witnessed Taubman's behavior and corroborated the Sports Illustrated account. Also, an article in The Chronicle said that no interviews were being conducted during the time of Taubman's outburst.
According to two people who witnessed the incident but requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about it, Taubman's comments were directed specifically at one of the reporters, who is known to tweet out the national domestic abuse hotline number when Osuna pitches. The reporter was also wearing a purple bracelet in support of victims of domestic violence in the clubhouse when Taubman shouted at her.
In a statement late Monday, the Astros disputed Sports Illustrated's article, calling it "completely irresponsible," and said Taubman was commenting only on what had happened in the game and was "supporting the player during a difficult time."
Taubman, who worked in the finance industry before joining the Astros in 2013, apologized in a statement on Tuesday for using "inappropriate language."
"In retrospect, I realize that my comments were unprofessional and inappropriate," Taubman said. "My overexuberance in support of a player has been misinterpreted as a demonstration of a regressive attitude about an important social issue."
Osuna had a poor outing on Saturday, giving up a home run and blowing the save in Game 6 of the A.L.C.S., though he was ultimately credited with the win after Jose Altuve's pennant-winning home run in the bottom of the ninth.
But video of at least one postgame interview shows Osuna in a buoyant mood in the celebration, which was so raucous that players told reporters the team had run out of beer.
A.J. Hinch, the Astros' manager, said before Game 1 on Tuesday he did not hear about the clubhouse outburst until the Sports Illustrated article had been published. He said he was "very disappointed" about what had happened.
"It's unfortunate, it's uncalled-for," he said, before adding: "No one -- it doesn't matter if it's a player, a coach, a manager, any of you members of the media -- should ever feel like when you come into our clubhouse that you're going to be uncomfortable or disrespected."
Osuna, an All-Star for the Toronto Blue Jays in 2017, became available on the trade market in 2018 -- at a reduced price -- because of his suspension. Jeff Luhnow, the Astros' general manager, told The New York Times last October that he and the team owner, Jim Crane, expected to be criticized for acquiring him, but that they had done extensive background work on Osuna.
"I knew there would be some consequences of making the move, but I didn't want to not make the move just because of that," Luhnow said at the time. "I was willing to take that on personally, and Jim and I agreed we were willing to have the organization take it on, subject to us doing our homework as best we could and feeling comfortable with the situation and the potential outcomes."
"Did we take a risk?" he added. "No question. Are there people that are still upset about it? No question. We're doing whatever we can at this point, supporting the relevant causes."
The Astros donated $ 214,000 last year to complete a women's center for Family Services of Southeast Texas, and have participated in other initiatives and programs related to domestic violence prevention.
Charges against Osuna were withdrawn in September 2018 after the alleged victim -- the mother of his child -- declined to travel to Toronto from Mexico and testify against him. Osuna agreed to stay away from the woman for a year and continue counseling.

Texto completo: The author of an anonymous column in the New York Times in 2018, who was identified as a senior Trump administration official acting as part of the "resistance" inside the government, has written a tell-all book to be published next month.
The book, titled "A Warning," is being promoted as "an unprecedented behind-the-scenes portrait of the Trump presidency" that expands upon the Times column, which ricocheted around the world and stoked the president's rage because of its devastating portrayal of Trump in office.
The column described Trump's leadership style as "impetuous, adversarial, petty and ineffective," and noted that "his impulsiveness results in half-baked, ill-informed and occasionally reckless decisions that have to be walked back."
The author of the column, which was headlined "I Am Part of the Resistance Inside the Trump Administration" and published Sept. 5, 2018, was known to the Times but identified only as a senior official in the Trump administration. The person has still not been publicly identified.
Trump lashed out at the anonymous author after the column's publication. The president questioned both whether the author existed and whether the author had committed treason. He also demanded on Twitter that the Times turn over "the GUTLESS anonymous person" to the government "at once." The Times did not.
The forthcoming book will list the author as "Anonymous." Although the person does not reveal their identity in the book, they will discuss the reasons for their anonymity, according to people involved in the project.
White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham mocked the forthcoming book and its author, saying in a statement, "It takes a lot of conviction and bravery to write a whole book anonymously."
The book will be published Nov. 19 by Twelve, an imprint of Grand Central Publishing/ Hachette Book Group. It comes during a treacherous period for Trump, as the House continues its fast-moving impeachment inquiry into allegations that the president abused his power.
The author is being represented by Matt Latimer and Keith Urbahn of Javelin, the same literary agents who represented fired FBI director James B. Comey and former White House aide Cliff Sims for their memoirs from their time in the Trump administration.
People involved in the project said that both Twelve and Javelin have verified that the book's author is the same person who wrote the Times column but would not share the author's identity with The Washington Post.
"There obviously will be those who want the author to reveal themselves publicly, but there are good reasons for that not to happen," Latimer said.
There is no modern historical parallel for a firsthand account of a sitting president written in book form by an anonymous author. Many senior government officials, including some who served in the Trump administration, have written books under their own names. Many more have shared information with journalists on the condition of anonymity, perhaps most famously the official known as Deep Throat who was a key source for Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein's reporting in The Post on the Watergate scandal.
The 1996 publication of "Primary Colors: A Novel of Politics" caused a sensation in part because of the anonymity of its author, who was later revealed to be columnist Joe Klein. The book was a work of fiction, although its characters and events mirrored Bill Clinton's 1992 presidential campaign.
Latimer said the anonymous author of "A Warning" did not take an advance and intends to donate some of the royalties to nonprofit organizations.
"The author could have received a seven-figure advance for writing this book," Latimer said. "But 'A WARNING' was not written for financial reasons. The author sees this as an act of conscience and of duty, which is why the author refused any advance and is donating a substantial portion of any royalties to charities that protect those seeking the truth around the world."

The New York Times editors cared about Hillary Clinton's email scandal — until suddenly they didn't

Texto completo: The New York Times has apparently been struck with a sudden and severe case of amnesia regarding its own position on Hillary Clinton and the shady things she did with her emails as secretary of state.
Here’s the Times editorial board commenting on Clinton’s email scandal six months before the 2016 election:
“Mrs. Clinton now faces a measurably greater challenge in proving that she is the well-qualified politician… [T]he nation should not be judging leadership as a measure of who is less untrustworthy. Mrs. Clinton has to answer questions about the report thoroughly and candidly.”
Now here’s the Times in a haughty editorial about a State Department investigation of itself that found no deliberate illegality among staff under Clinton’s tenure: “What about her emails? Donald Trump raised that question like a red flag for three years, as candidate and president, casting doubts on how Hillary Clinton used a private email server to communicate with her staff and others while she was secretary of state.”
Uh, was it Donald Trump who made Clinton install a private server in her home and then have it destroyed, along with 30,000 of the emails it contained?
Nope. She did that all on her own, and the Times's editors were there at least pretending to be concerned about it. That was just three years ago.
Those 30,000 emails, by the way, were arguably the property of the U.S. government. Clinton deleted them, then bleached the server in hopes that they’d never be recovered. In essence, she tried to destroy government property.
But faster than you can say "whataboutism!" the Times editorial board on Monday attempted to equate Clinton’s email practices with those of Trump administration officials.
“Despite Mr. Trump’s professed concern about the integrity of government communications,” the paper said, “His administration doesn’t seem to take it too seriously.”
Okay, then — let’s fine, fire, and penalize anyone in the current administration that’s using private email addresses to conduct official business. But let’s not pretend it’s the same thing as Clinton hooking up her own homebrew in a basement so that she could disappear anything she wanted to be kept secret, then desperately trying to destroy evidence.
Multiple investigations into Clinton and her server scandal found malfeasance. Former FBI Director James Comey said in 2016 that she was “extremely careless” with classified information. The latest internal investigation at State found nearly 40 staff members at the department who, because of Clinton’s private server needs, had violated protocols that put government information in jeopardy. An Associated Press report last week — which was even run on the Times website — said that the investigation concluded that “Clinton's use of the private email had increased the vulnerability of classified information.”
The Times editorial board may have forgotten all the serious problems with Clinton and her emails. But its members can remind themselves by simply looking back and reading their own position from three years ago.

Feminist book's publisher cancels US release after one radio host dismantled her premise

Texto completo: Thank goodness for small mercies.
Feminist author Naomi Wolf’s publisher has canceled the U.S. release of her new book, Outrages: Sex, Censorship, and the Criminalization of Love, after its entire premise seemed to collapse in May following a brutal on-air interview with the BBC.
“On Monday, a spokeswoman for Houghton Mifflin Harcourt said in an email that Ms. Wolf and the publisher 'mutually and amicably agreed to part company,'" the New York Times reported this week, adding that Wolf “confirmed the parting.”
The decision to “part company” comes months after Houghton Mifflin Harcourt already suspended its scheduled release of Wolf’s book, recalling thousands of already-distributed copies at a great financial cost to itself, following her disastrous interview with BBC’s Matthew Sweet.
It was during that sit-down with the British radio host that Wolf appeared to reveal that the premise of her book — that Victorian England was so draconianly anti-gay that its laws allowed for the execution of men found to be guilty of the act of sodomy — is based on her misunderstanding of a legal term.
To wit, Wolf revealed she understood the British legal term “death recorded” to mean “execute” rather than what it really meant, which is “pardoned.”
“One of the cases that you look at that’s salient in your report is that of Thomas Silver,” Sweet said during his May interview with Wolf, reading directly from an advance copy of her book. “It says … ['he] was actually executed for committing sodomy. The boy was indicted for an unnatural offense. Guilty. Death recorded. This is the first time the phrase unnatural offense entered the Old Bailey records.’”
Sweet added, “Thomas Silver wasn’t executed. … Death recorded is what’s in, I think, most of these cases that you’ve identified as executions. It doesn’t mean that he was executed. It was a category that was created in 1823 that allowed judges to abstain from pronouncing a sentence of death on any capital convict who they considered to be a fit subject for pardon. I don’t think any of the executions you’ve identified here actually happened.”
“Well, that’s a really important thing to investigate,” Wolf said meekly.
You think?
Tweet
If you can imagine it, things took a turn for the worse for Wolf during the BBC interview. Sweet also revealed that most of the cases highlighted in her book did not even involve consensual same-sex relations.
“Also,” he said, “it’s the nature of the offense here. Thomas Silver committed an indecent assault on a 6-year-old boy. And he served two-and-a-half years for it in Portsmouth prison, which doesn’t seem too excessive really."
Sweet added, “And I wonder about all the others because all the others that I followed up, I can’t find any evidence that any of these relationships that you’ve described were consensual. The other one you offer is James Spence, a 60-year-old tutor. He committed what was described as felonious assault on schoolboys. One of these cases you offer is a bestiality case and not a buggery case.”
This is devastating stuff. You would think Wolf would pack it up and start over. But you would be wrong. As recently as Oct. 1, she was still fighting the characterization that her book is essentially a tome of factual errors.
Tweet
I guess we should not be shocked, then, when the New York Times reports this week that Wolf declared in an email that the book “would come out in the United States ‘in due course.’”
Please, no. There is only so much fake news this country can sustain.

Paul Krugman: Can Warren escape the Medicare for All trap?

Texto completo: On Sunday, Elizabeth Warren said that she would soon release a plan explaining how she intends to pay for “Medicare for All.” Like many policy wonks, I’ll be waiting with bated breath; this could be a make or break moment for her campaign, and possibly for the 2020 election.
There are three things you need to know about Medicare for All, which in the current debate has come to mean a pure single-payer health insurance system, in which the government provides all coverage, with no role for private insurers.
First, single-payer has a lot to recommend it as a way to achieve universal health care. It’s not the only route — every major advanced country besides the United States achieves universal coverage, but many of them get there via regulations and subsidies rather than by relying solely on public insurance. Still, single-payer is clean and simple, and many health economists would support it if we were starting from scratch.
But we aren’t starting from scratch, which is the second thing you need to know. More than half of Americans are covered by private health insurance, mainly through employers.
Not many people love their insurance companies, but that doesn’t mean that they’re eager to trade the coverage they know for a new system they don’t. Most people probably would end up better off under single-payer, but convincing them of that would be a hard sell; polls show much less support for Medicare for All than for a “public option” plan in which people could retain private insurance if they chose to.
Which brings me to the third point: In reality, single-payer won’t happen any time soon. Even if Democrats win in a landslide in 2020, taking control of the Senate as well as the White House, it’s very unlikely that they will have the votes to eliminate private insurance.
Warren, who has made policy seriousness a key part of her political persona — “Warren has a plan for that” — surely knows all of this. And early this year she seemed to recognize the problems with a purist single-payer approach, saying that she was open to different paths toward universal coverage.
Since then, however, she seems to have gone all in for the elimination of private insurance.
I have no inside information about what led her to take that plunge, but my guess is that she was trying to protect her left flank — to avoid alienating supporters of Bernie Sanders, who have made single-payer a kind of purity test one must pass to be considered a true progressive. And I’m not going to criticize her for engaging in a bit of political realism; after all, the case against Medicare for All is itself basically political.
At this point, however, it’s looking as if Warren may have painted herself into a corner.
Part, but only part, of the issue involves cost.
Journalists have been badgering Warren to get specific about how much taxes would have to go up to pay for Medicare for All. She has, with considerable justice, insisted that this is a bad way to frame the discussion, since any additional taxes would be offset by savings on the huge premiums workers and their employers now pay for private insurance — on average, more than $20,000 a year for a family plan.
The right question is whether the overall costs facing U.S. families would go up or down. Warren has been claiming that for most families, they would go down, but she hasn’t offered specifics. And this vagueness, which has started to seem like evasiveness, is more of a problem for her than it might be for other politicians. As I said, Warren has made policy seriousness a key aspect of her political persona, so her fogginess on health care really stands out.
The plan in the works will presumably try to dispel that fog, but doing so will be tricky. An independent estimate from the Urban Institute (which is, for what it’s worth, left-leaning) suggests that a highly comprehensive Medicare-for-All plan, similar to what Sanders is proposing, would substantially increase overall health spending, although a more modest plan wouldn’t.
But cost isn’t the only issue — in fact, I’m not sure how important it really is, given that full abolition of private insurance remains unlikely in practice. Also, let’s get real: If Warren gets the Democratic nomination, the outcome of the general election isn’t going to hinge on dueling think tank estimates.
The election might, however, hinge on the support of people who have good private coverage and would be nervous about making a leap into the unknown, no matter how many facts and figures Warren deploys.
So what I’ll want to see is whether Warren gives herself and her party enough flexibility to assuage these concerns. I’m not sure what form that flexibility might take. Maybe something like an extended transition period, with greatly enhanced Obamacare (which might actually be politically doable) in the interim?
Whatever Warren comes up with, this is a crucial moment. There are many excellent things in her overall policy agenda; but she won’t get a chance to do those things unless she can extricate herself from what looks like a health policy trap.

Texto completo: Maricela, una inmigrante salvadoreña que no quiere dar su apellido por temor, llevaba más de una década inscribiendo a sus hijos, nacidos en Estados Unidos, en el programa de seguro médico gratuito Medicaid . Este año decidió no hacerlo.
“Mi peor miedo es terminar perdiendo mi estatus legal y ser separada de mis hijos”, le relató esta madre soltera de Houston (Texas) al diario The New York Times.
El gobierno que preside Donald Trump ha aprobado una regla para negar el visado o la residencia permanente a los migrantes que puedan requerir ayudas sociales . Un tribunal federal ha bloqueado temporalmente la medida, que no afecta además al seguro médico de los menores de 21 años .
[INFÓRMESE: Éstas son las 8 ayudas públicas que pueden cancelar su visado o green card]
El hijo mayor de Maricela tiene 11 años y sufre asma. Sin seguro, su tratamiento cuesta 150 dólares al mes. Tras escucharle toser por la noche, decidió al fin apuntar a los dos niños a Medicaid. Pero Maricela tiene miedo: “Sería mortal para mí”, asegura sobre su posible deportación, “tuve que hacerlo, pero tengo miedo”.
No es la única: más de un millón de niños en todo el país –el 3% de todos los inscritos– han desaparecido de la lista de los dos principales programas de salud estatales y federales para familias de bajos ingresos, Medicaid y el Programa de Seguro de Salud para Niños (CHIP), entre diciembre de 2017 y junio de 2019.
Un análisis del censo realizado por The New York Times muestra que el número de niños sin ningún tipo de seguro aumentó bajo el gobierno de Trump en más de 400,000 entre 2016 y 2018 .
Funcionarios estatales y federales han justificado sin embargo este descenso por la mejora de la economía, que ha permitido, han dicho, que muchas familias obtengan empleos con un seguro privado.“El desempleo sigue siendo bajo, el crecimiento salarial ha aumentado, y ahora vemos que menos personas dependen de la asistencia pública”, dijo en abril Seema Verma, administradora de los Centros de Servicios de Medicare y Medicaid. “Eso es algo para celebrar”, añadió.
Pero de acuerdo con el análisis periodístico, los cambios administrativos destinados supuestamente a combatir el fraude y el despilfarro de recursos, y los crecientes temores por las medidas migratorias de Trump , han jugado un papel en el descenso de los niños inscritos en los programas federales de seguro médico.
Los descensos se concentran en una minoría de estados; en otros, la cobertura pública ha aumentado. Texas, donde el 40% de la población es latina, lidera el número de niños y adultos sin seguro médico .
Kelli Weldon, portavoz de la Comisión de Salud de ese estado, lo ha achacado a los “niveles récord de bajo desempleo”.
Algunos de los estados que registraron los mayores aumentos en niños sin seguro, como Tennessee y Texas, fueron los que crearon reglas para verificar la elegibilidad de las familias con mayor frecuencia, o actualizaron sus listas de beneficiarios con nuevos sistemas informáticos.
+ inscribe ahora a los niños durante seis meses y luego revisa las bases de datos durante cuatro meses consecutivos para garantizar que el ingreso familiar aún sea lo suficientemente bajo como para calificar para el programa. Si las bases de datos muestran que el ingreso ha superado el límite, se notifica a las familias por correo y tienen 10 días para demostrar lo contrario o perder el seguro.
El número de niños sin seguro en ese estado aumentó en alrededor de 120,000 entre 2016 y 2018. Los funcionarios estatales aumentaron además los requisitos de papeleo en 2014 para las familias cubiertas por Medicaid y CHIP , que atiende a niños cuyos ingresos son ligeramente más altos que los de Medicaid.
Otros estados también han comenzado a controlar los ingresos familiares con más frecuencia, o eliminar familias que podrían haberse mudado si el correo es devuelto.
Cuando Tennessee actualizó su sistema informático de inscripción en 2016, generó miles de errores. La inscripción de Medicaid y CHIP en ese estado ha disminuido en más de 55,000 niños desde enero de 2018, según el Centro de Niños y Familias de Georgetown.
El director de Medicaid de Tennessee, Gabe Roberts, dijo que, además de la mejora de la economía, l a disminución de la inscripción fue el resultado de actualizar el sistema informático y eliminar una acumulación de casos antiguos .
Sin embargo, en ese estado los mayores descensos en la inscripción de Medicaid se produjeron en los condados con las tasas de desempleo más altas, según un análisis del Centro de Justicia.
En 2010, la Ley del Cuidado de Salud Asequible, conocida como Obamacare, facilitó que los estados verificaran si las familias calificaban para Medicaid sin requerir que completaran la documentación , una estrategia probada para aumentar las tasas de cobertura. Además, Obamacare dificultó que los estados expulsaran a las familias pobres por errores de papeleo.
Para el año próximo, habrá 20 aseguradoras más vendiendo planes de Obamacare en el mercado federal, que es utilizado por personas en 38 estados, para un total de 175, informó The New York Times.
El término Obamacare generalmente se usa para describir un seguro médico privado adquirido a través de los intercambios de seguro médico; los planes son ofrecidos por compañías privadas de seguros de salud; Medicaid es un plan federal gratuito pero los requisitos para que se otorgue tienen que ver con el nivel de pobreza definido en cada estado y son estrictos.

Texto completo: The person identified as a senior Trump administration official who anonymously penned an explosive op-ed in The New York Times last year has written a tell-all book about Donald Trump's presidency.
The book, titled "A Warning," is set to be released on Nov. 19, according to a press release from publishing company Twelve, part of Hachette Book Group. The publisher says the person's identity will remain a secret and that the book picks up "where those first words of warning left off. "
The author wrote in the September 2018 op-ed called "I Am Part of the Resistance Inside the Trump Administration" that Trump's behavior is "erratic" and that his aides were working to keep some of his "bad decisions" contained.
"It may be cold comfort in this chaotic era, but Americans should know that there are adults in the room. We fully recognize what is happening. And we are trying to do what’s right even when Donald Trump won’t," the anonymous author wrote.
Trump publicly blasted the author at the time and accused the Times of fabricating the op-ed.
"Does the so-called 'Senior Administration Official' really exist, or is it just the Failing New York Times with another phony source?" Trump tweeted.
The Times' decision to publish an op-ed anonymously was highly unusual. The paper has knowledge of the op-ed writer's identity, but those details remain unknown to the public.
White House officials said it is unfair to allow the author to remain anonymous, and even some Trump critics wonder why Anonymous should remain anonymous.
"It takes a lot conviction and bravery to write a whole book anonymously," said White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham.
Cliff Sims, former White House aide, author his own book called “Team of Vipers" also criticized the book.
He tweeted: "This anonymous coward will be lionized be the media but there’s nothing honorable about being “the resistance” inside the Admin & undermining the duly elected POTUS. What a disgrace. If this were being done to Obama the media would be screaming TREASON. "
"The author of this book should report any alleged wrongdoing so the matter can be investigated," said Renato Mariotti, a former federal prosecutor who has been critical of Trump.
"And if the author is aware of disturbing information that the public ought to know that does not amount to wrongdoing, should come forward so the public can assess that information and the author’s credibility," Mariotti said. "If the author continues to serve in the administration, he or she should resign in order to speak freely. "
The book comes as Trump is embroiled in an impeachment probe into his dealings with Ukraine, sparked by a whistleblower complaint, also from an anonymous person. Trump is accused of improperly pressuring a foreign leader to investigate domestic political rivals in exchange for military aid.
The publisher says that the anonymous book author did not take an advance payment for the book, and plans to donate a substantial amount of royalties to "non-profit organizations that focus on government accountability and on supporting those who stand up for the truth in repressive countries around the world. "
"The author sees this as an act of conscience and of duty," a representative of the author, Matt Latimer, told The Washington Post.

What happened to ‘Hunted'?

Autor: Heldenfels, Rich. 

Información de publicación: Florida Times Union ; Jacksonville, Fla. [Jacksonville, Fla]. 22 Oct 2019: 4.

Texto completo: TV Q&A

Q: What is the status of the show where two people are given a head start and then chased down by professional manhunters?

A: It sounds as if you remember "Hunted," a CBS series in which teams of two people each tried to elude investigators for 28 days. It aired in 2017 and was canceled after a single seven-episode season. The show, by the way, was based on a British series of the same name which is still running, including with a celebrity version.

Q: Can you please tell me why NBC did not bring back "Manifest"? I enjoyed the show and was hoping to find out what was behind the disappearance of the plane and the people.

A: The first info I can share is that the series is coming back. NBC ordered a second season of the thriller; look for it in 2020. As I mentioned in another column, shows no longer begin only in the fall but may arrive in the winter, spring or summer, depending on their networks' plans and when other shows are scheduled. Football, for example, takes up a lot of real estate in the prime-time fall and some shows are held back until after it is done.

Q: Do you know what happened to Dr. Rhodes on "Chicago Med"? Also, what happened to "Station 19"?

A: To start with "Station 19," this is another case of a series being held back from fall premieres but planned for later in the season. I do not have an airdate.

The "Chicago" dramas ("Med," "Fire," "P.D.") often make casting changes, as you know from previous questions and answers here about actors coming on going. "Chicago" mastermind Dick Wolf, who is also the maestro of the many "Law & Order" series, has always been willing to shake up casts for a variety of reasons. On "Chicago Med," it was reported back in April that Dr. Connor Rhodes (played by Colin Donnell) was being written out of the series along with Dr. Ava Bekker (Norma Kuhling). Deadline.com reported that those changes -- along with Jon Seda's departure from "Chicago P.D." -- were the result of "creative reasons related to the characters' story evolution." At least Donnell's departure was not in a box, so it's always possible he'll return sometime. Wolf's shows also have a history of bringing back people, at least as guest stars.

Q: How many movies did Harold Russell make? What became of him?

A: For those of you tuning in late, Harold Russell was a real-life World War II veteran who lost both his hands in an accident while teaching demolition work. He then played a returning veteran who lost his hands "The Best Years of Our Lives" and won two Oscars for the role -- a special award and a best supporting actor prize. Not trained as an actor, nor apparently inclined toward the profession, he went decades between acting roles, from "Best Years" in 1946 to "Inside Moves" in 1980, according to the Internet Movie Database. Besides one other film, "Dogtown" in 1997, he made a few TV appearances but spent more time working with veterans' organizations. Life was not always kind to him; in 1993, according to the New York Times, he needed money and sold one of his Oscars to get it. He died in 2002 at the age of 88.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - Former Vice President Joe Biden isn't the only national politician who has been accused of having a conflict of interest involving a family member. He joins a long list that includes some of the nation's earliest leaders and President Donald Trump.
It is a thorny problem, lawyers and experts specializing in government ethics said, as family members find ways to cash in on their ties to politicians' prominence and power despite attempts to curb that exploitation with laws and federal personnel restrictions.
"The undue influence peddling is a difficult one to try to address through public policy," said Craig Holman, a lobbyist at the liberal public policy group Public Citizen. For example, he said, "You can't really make it illegal for a son to take a private sector job somewhere."
Over the past 50 years, family scandals, many involving siblings, have erupted on presidents, prompting public outcry, investigations and eventually new laws.
President Richard Nixon's brothers Edward and Donald took loans that led to questions of political influence and misuse of campaign contributions. The Senate probed President Jimmy Carter's brother Billy for visiting Libya, registering as its agent and getting a loan.
President Bill Clinton's brother-in-law Hugh Rodham charged clients seeking clemency during Clinton's flood of pardons as he left office, spawning a scalding House panel report and a federal probe into influence peddling that resulted in no indictments.
And Neil Bush, a brother of President George W. Bush, prompted questions about the propriety of starting an education business that won contracts paid for by No Child Behind Left Act federal grants.
Congress has tried over the past six decades to address public officials' family entanglements.
It barred public officials from hiring relatives in an early bid to curb family members from benefiting from office holders' positions. It enacted financial disclosure and foreign agent registration requirements to expose conflicting connections in the wake of the Watergate scandal.
It created a law banning federal employees from influencing any government matter to affect their and their spouse and minor children's financial interests in 2006.
But no laws address the latest iteration - adult children of public officials cashing in through foreign companies or governments.
That's what Democratic presidential candidate Biden's son Hunter did. He took a lucrative position as a board member of a Ukrainian gas company in 2014, when his father as vice president became the Obama administration's point man on Ukraine and its corruption problem.
Biden did not discourage his son from taking the job. He said he never talked to his son about the potential conflict. Hunter Biden, who quit the board this year, told The New Yorker magazine they did speak once: "Dad said, 'I hope you know what you are doing,' and I said, 'I do.'"
The younger Biden admitted in an ABC News interview he made a mistake taking the Ukraine and China posts but denied it was based on some "ethical lapse." And he acknowledged his father's shadow had affected him. "I don't think there's a lot of things that would have happened in my life if my last name wasn't Biden."
Hunter Biden also stepped down from a Chinese-backed venture capital firm set up in 2013 as he joined his father on Air Force 2 for a visit to China.
So far, no evidence has emerged to prove Trump's accusations that Biden threatened to withhold a U.S. loan guarantee from Ukraine to force the firing of a prosecutor who had probed the gas company to help his son rather than as part of an international anti-corruption campaign.
"I don't really believe there was any type of quid pro quo or any type of influence peddling going on there," said Holman. "However, it certainly has the appearance of - you know, it looks bad."
Biden last week said he has no regrets about Hunter. But he pledged if he becomes president: "No one in my family ... will in fact have any business relationship with anyone that relates to a foreign corporation or a foreign country."
Trump, who has repeatedly lambasted Joe Biden for his son's activities, faces complaints and criticism over his own children.
His daughter Ivanka, who serves as his unpaid White House adviser, has won 39 potentially lucrative trademarks she applied for in 2016 from Chinese officials in the past two years as Trump has engaged in high-stakes trade negotiations with China.
And Trump, who is facing an impeachment inquiry by House Democrats over urging Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden, also has boosted his own businesses, which he turned over to his sons to run while he serves as president.
"In the end, they can't necessarily control their adult children, and that's also a part of the problem - although they could publicly call them on it," said longtime government ethics advocate Fred Wertheimer, president of the nonprofit Democracy 21.
That's what Carter did when he issued a statement that pointedly said his brother Billy had no influence over U.S. policy toward Libya or the Middle East and that as president he would treat him as a paid advocate for Libya.
Lawmakers could draw brighter legal and ethical lines, lawyers and advocates said.
Meredith McGehee, executive director of the advocacy group Issue One, said Congress could adopt stronger rules and limits on use of inside information and the president could set the tone for all public officials by issuing a tougher presidential executive order on ethics.
Peter Schweizer, whose book about politicians' family conflicts fuels Trumps' attacks on the Bidens, proposed in a recent New York Times Op-Ed that Congress pass a law to bar a foreign company or government from hiring the family members of American politicians.
Holman said he would borrow from the law that restricts lobbying of members of Congress by members of their family and make it a violation of a conflict of interest code for any immediate family member to try to influence public policy with a public official, including the president.
"There's only so much you can do," said Wertheimer, who acknowledged difficulties in codifying legal or ethical restraints.
"What about common-sense ethics?" he said.
"Both the office holder and the relative have an obligation to the American people not to create the appearance that the office holder's office is being used for the personal financial gain of the relative," he said, "because that simply undermines public confidence in the office holder and the whole sys

Texto completo: More than 100 American military vehicles entered Iraq on Monday, accelerating a pullout that greatly reduces American clout in Syria.
QAMISHLI, Syria -- Heckled by Kurds who feel betrayed, a long convoy of United States troops crossed into Iraq early Monday, accelerating a withdrawal of American forces from northern Syria that set the stage for the Turkish invasion of Kurdish-controlled land.
More than 100 American military vehicles left Syrian Kurdish territory in the early morning, according to a cameraman for the Reuters news agency who was at the border crossing.
Residents threw rocks and potatoes at the convoy as it drove through Qamishli, a major city in Kurdish-held territory. In video posted online by a local Kurdish news outlet, ANHA Hawar, men hurling potatoes at an armored vehicle shouted "No America" and "America liar," in English.
Another group tried to block the convoy's progress by standing in its path and holding placards of protest.
"The Americans are running away like rats," one man could be heard shouting.
President Trump's withdrawal of American troops from the region, which cleared the way for Turkey to attack Kurdish forces, has prompted Republicans and Democrats alike to accuse him of abandoning a United States ally. A coalition of Syrian Kurdish fighters, Americans and other foreign troops had fought the Islamic State in northeastern Syria since 2014.
Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper confirmed Monday that the United States was considering keeping a small force in northeastern Syria, alongside the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, to prevent oil fields there from falling into the hands of the Islamic State.
About 1,000 American troops were in Syria before the withdrawal began this month. The New York Times reported that Mr. Trump was leaning toward leaving perhaps 200 troops there.
The withdrawal has drastically reduced American clout in Syria, ceding more control and influence to the Syrian government, Russia and Iran. It has also raised fears of a revival of the Islamic State, the extremist group that once controlled an area in Iraq and Syria the size of Britain.
Though Mr. Trump has characterized the move as bringing troops home, Mr. Esper said Sunday that most forces would be redeployed to western Iraq, where they would continue operations against the Islamic State.
In an earlier phase of the withdrawal, coalition forces bombed their own base and arms cache in northern Syria to prevent enemies from using it.
Some Syrian Kurds see the withdrawal as a betrayal, since it has enabled Turkish-led forces to invade the area and potentially force Kurds from their ancestral homes.
"There will be ethnic cleansing of the Kurdish people from Syria, and the American administration will be responsible for it," Mazlum Kobani, whose Kurdish-led force fought the Islamic State in Syria, said Sunday in an interview with The Times.
Turkish officials say their campaign is targeting only Mr. Kobani's militia, not Syrian Kurds at large. Over 200 Syrian civilians have died since the invasion began, while at least 20 have died in Kurdish counterattacks in southern Turkey. More than 170,000 people have been displaced, according to estimates by the International Committee of the Red Cross.
Until this month, northeastern Syria had largely been under the control of the Syrian Democratic Forces, a Kurdish-led militia that had used the chaos of the eight-year civil war to establish an autonomous region that operated independently of both the central government in Damascus and Syrian Arab rebel fighters.
The American-led campaign against the Islamic State, also known as ISIS, allowed the Kurdish force to expand its territory and take over the governance of land seized from the extremists.
But the creation of an American-backed and Kurdish-held canton along the Turkish-Syrian border became a source of great anxiety for the Turkish government, which considers the Kurdish militia a threat to national security. The militia is led by an offshoot of a Kurdish guerrilla movement that has waged a decades-long insurgency against the Turkish state.
The American withdrawal has allowed Turkish troops and its Syrian Arab proxies to seize more than 900 square miles of territory once held by Kurds, according to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey.
After a stuttering start to an American-mediated cease-fire, Turkish and Kurdish fighters were largely adhering to a five-day truce that is to last until Tuesday evening. Sporadic skirmishes continued, but Kurdish fighters were able to withdraw from a strategic town on the Syrian border.
Mr. Erdogan has said that all Kurdish fighters must retreat from a central pocket of former Kurdish-held territory by Tuesday night, and he has threatened to expand the Turkish invasion if any Kurdish fighters remain.
Mr. Erdogan wants to use the land to create a sphere of Turkish influence in northern Syria in which Syrian refugees who currently live in Turkey can be resettled.

Trump's Base Is Steadfast Even as Troubles Mount

Texto completo: Republicans remain almost unanimously opposed to removing President Trump from office, leaving him with a loyal but shrinking core of supporters.
A new survey of the country's cultural and political landscape found that support for impeaching and removing President Trump from office is rising among most Americans, but that Republicans remain almost unanimously opposed, leaving Mr. Trump with a loyal but shrinking core of supporters.
The findings, released on Monday by the Public Religion Research Institute, a nonpartisan nonprofit based in Washington, also pointed to striking divisions among Republicans themselves, with white evangelical Christians and those who regularly get their information from Fox News forming a distinct and exceedingly devoted base of support for the president -- many of whom say that there is virtually nothing he could do to make them lose faith in him.
Ninety-nine percent of white evangelicals and 98 percent of Republicans who rely on Fox News as their primary news source do not believe Mr. Trump should be impeached and removed, the survey found, compared with 94 percent of Republicans over all.
As committed as those Americans are to Mr. Trump, they alone are not enough for him to win re-election next year. And the survey revealed significant defections among some non-Republican constituencies that helped Mr. Trump win in 2016, namely the white working class. This trend is driven by white women without a college degree, 40 percent of whom now say they support impeaching and removing him, compared with 29 percent who said so in mid-September.
Those figures are especially problematic because of the political clout those women have in the Midwestern states that put Mr. Trump over the top in the Electoral College in 2016. That year, the group supported Mr. Trump over Hillary Clinton, 61 percent to 34 percent.
"If you have lost, in the space of a month, 11 points of support from non-college white women," said Robert P. Jones, chief executive of the Public Religion Research Institute, "that should give President Trump some pause. That's a big big group, and they matter in the states where Trump has just got to win -- Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania."
The survey sought to measure key indicators of political polarization in the country by asking Americans about their views on a range of subjects, including immigration and their impressions of the opposing political party, and then accounted for certain environmental factors like where they got their news and how they worshiped. Interviews were conducted in August, September and October and captured opinions before and after House Democrats announced their impeachment inquiry.
Some of the greatest disparities were among Republicans. Those who are white evangelical Christians or regular Fox News viewers -- and those who are both -- differ significantly from other Republicans in the policies they support and in their tolerance for Mr. Trump's personal conduct.
The opinions of this subset hew closely to Mr. Trump's positions on immigration, for instance. Both groups, which make up more than a third of the party, are more likely than other Republicans to back Trump administration policies like the separation of migrant families apprehended at the border. And they largely shrug when asked whether they wished he behaved more like a typical president.
When asked whether they believed that immigrants were "invading the country" and replacing its ethnic and cultural background, 78 percent of Republicans who rely on Fox News said yes, compared with 52 percent of Republicans who do not consider the network their main news source.
Among the Republicans who said they wished Mr. Trump's behavior were more consistent with that of other presidents, only 29 percent were regular Fox News viewers, compared with 60 percent who were not.
"That's pretty remarkable," Mr. Jones said, "when you have this one variable that can cause a 10-, 20-, 30-point gap."
And when the survey asked whether Mr. Trump's conduct made them more likely or less likely to support him, white evangelicals were the largest bloc of people who said his actions made no difference at all, at 47 percent. A clear majority of Republicans who support the president and watch Fox News, 55 percent, responded that there was virtually nothing he could do to make them stop supporting him.
Though many of the survey's most striking findings were on the polarization within the Republican Party, there were other signs that the rest of the country was just as divided.
Eighty-two percent of Republicans, for example, believe the Democratic Party has been taken over by socialists. And almost the same percentage of Democrats, 80 percent, said the Republican Party had been taken over by racists.

The Unraveling of Mick Mulvaney

Texto completo: The White House chief of staff, still "acting" after all these months, should never have been cast in the role of spin doctor.
There he goes again.
This weekend, Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, sat down with Chris Wallace on "Fox News Sunday" to try to bind some of the gaping wounds he'd inflicted on President Trump's impeachment defense in recent days. Instead, Mr. Mulvaney again flubbed his lines, making himself look even more inept and dishonest. Yet this alone does not fully address why the White House ringmaster now finds himself an object of ridicule even among members of his own party -- a situation for which he is only partly to blame.
Mr. Mulvaney's adventure began on Thursday at a news briefing held so that he could explain why Mr. Trump's decision to host next year's Group of 7 summit at the struggling Trump Doral golf resort in Miami was not another bit of naked self-dealing -- or, as Mr. Trump himself put it on Monday, not a violation of "this phony Emoluments clause." After a deluge of criticism from Republicans, Mr. Trump reversed the decision on Saturday, blaming "the Hostile Media & their Democrat Partners" for causing a fuss.
Journalists being the impertinent nudges they are, Mr. Mulvaney soon found himself fielding questions about impeachment. Next thing you know, he's peevishly lecturing everyone that not only had Mr. Trump's order to withhold aid money from Ukraine been partly contingent on Ukraine agreeing to investigate his political enemies but that this sort of thing happens all the time. "I have news for everybody: Get over it," he snipped.
Now, while Mr. Trump's apologists have not yet settled on a precise rationalization for why the president pressured a foreign government to meddle in American elections, some defenders have clung to the position that there was no quid pro quo. As such, Mr. Mulvaney's admission, delivered on camera and in front of the press corps, was not met with universal acclaim within Trumpworld.
Jay Sekulow, the best known of Mr. Trump's personal lawyers not under federal investigation, fired off a statement clarifying that the president's counsel had not prepped the chief of staff before the briefing.
An unnamed official at the Justice Department declared, "If the White House was withholding aid in regards to the cooperation of any investigation at the Department of Justice, that is news to us."
The most piquant assessment came from the conservative pundit Sean Hannity, the captain of Mr. Trump's cheer squad. "What is Mulvaney even talking about?" he demanded on his radio show on Thursday. "I just think he's dumb, I really do."
By late Thursday, Mr. Mulvaney decided a bit of a walk-back was in order, and he issued a statement claiming that he hadn't said what he had said, even though his words had been captured on camera.
Then came Mr. Mulvaney's damage-control sit-down on Fox News on Sunday morning. He started out insisting that people were misstating what he had said, but Mr. Wallace was having none of it. "You were asked specifically by Jonathan Karl [of ABC News], Was investigating Democrats one of the conditions for holding up the aid -- was that part of the quid pro quo? And you said, 'It happens all the time."' This sent Mr. Mulvaney spinning even more furiously, to which Mr. Wallace responded, "I hate to go through this, but you said what you said." Mr. Mulvaney could protest all he wanted. Mr. Wallace had video receipts.
The acting chief wasn't much better at trying to explain why Mr. Trump thought it a good idea to hold the Group of 7 gathering at one of his company's resorts. "At the end of the day, he still considers himself to be in the hospitality business," Mr. Mulvaney said.
Reviews of Mr. Mulvaney's Sunday gig were not kind, even among the president's friends and advisers -- one of whom characterized it to Politico as "a self-immolation." For weeks, word around Washington has been that Mr. Mulvaney has lost favor at the White House. The past few days have kicked speculation into high gear about how much longer he can hang on.
It's easy to mock Mr. Mulvaney's missteps. He has emerged as one of Mr. Trump's top go-to guys for carrying out questionable orders, such as taking the practical steps necessary to withhold Ukraine's aid money or shove aside career diplomats in favor of political lackeys.
But, in Mr. Mulvaney's defense, he should never have been put in this position. The guy who's doing the dirty work should not also be the guy expected to go out and defend it to a roomful of journalists. That's what a press secretary is for -- preferably a professional steeped in the dark art of ensorcelling the Fourth Estate.
Seriously, does anyone think Sarah Huckabee Sanders, in her turn as Mr. Trump's chief spinner, would have been goaded into admitting a presidential quid pro quo and then admonish everyone for being naïve about that sort of thing? Of course not. She was too adept at dodging, deflecting and flat-out lying to blurt out such an inconvenient truth. If nothing else, she would have pleaded ignorance of the details -- which would have been a tougher sell for Mr. Mulvaney given his role as a recurring character in the Ukraine shenanigans.
Here we see a concrete downside to the White House's slapdash approach to staffing, its disdain for professionalism and this president's conviction that, because he's such a communications whiz, he doesn't need a message team backing him up.
Not that you'll hear journalists complaining. While they may long for the days of regular White House briefings, they know that a more seasoned communications gatekeeper would never have stumbled as Mr. Mulvaney has.
At work on Monday morning, Mr. Mulvaney received applause from senior aides, CNN reported. He'd taken a bullet for all of them -- even if he had helped load the gun.

Texto completo: Readers have asked The New York Times why asking another nation for help ahead of an election is such a serious issue. Here are some answers.
WASHINGTON -- A July 25 call between President Trump and the president of Ukraine is the basis for an impeachment inquiry into whether Mr. Trump withheld American military aid until Ukrainian officials investigated former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his son, Hunter.
Last week the acting White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, effectively acknowledged the quid pro quo, although he said the aid was in part contingent on Ukraine's investigating Mr. Trump's widely debunked theory that Ukraine, not Russia, was responsible for hacking Democratic Party emails in 2016. The theory is politically helpful to Mr. Trump because it would show he was elected president without that Russian help.
Mr. Mulvaney was unapologetic in his remarks. "I have news for everybody: Get over it," Mr. Mulvaney told reporters at the White House. "There's going to be political influence in foreign policy." (He later reversed himself and has said his comments were misconstrued.)
Readers have asked The New York Times to explain why, exactly, another nation's interference in the democratic process is such a serious issue.
Here are some answers.
Why don't we want foreign countries involved in our elections?
Other countries have their own interests, and those interests don't always match ours, said Trevor Potter, the founder of the Campaign Legal Center, a nonpartisan group that works to ensure fair elections.
"Many countries are rivals of ours and of our democratic system," Mr. Potter said. He listed as two chief examples China and Russia, countries that Mr. Trump has publicly suggested could help him achieve his political aims. "In some cases, they're going to want policies that help them and therefore hurt us. In other cases, though, they just want us to fail."
Trump administration officials -- but not the president himself -- have publicly and repeatedly warned foreign governments not to meddle in American elections.
Are protections against this kind of thing in place?
Yes. The ability of a foreign nation to gain access and influence over America's democratic process has been a concern since the early days of the republic.
During the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia in the summer of 1787, delegates debated what kind of behavior should merit a president's removal from office. George Mason suggested the standard of "high crimes and misdemeanors," which holds to this day. One of the high crimes the framers had in mind was accepting money from a foreign power, or what Alexander Hamilton said was giving in to "the desire in foreign powers to gain an improper ascendant in our councils."
In short, the authors of the Constitution saw few bigger threats than a president corruptly tied to forces from overseas.
What was the quid pro quo on the Ukraine call?
Mr. Trump has denied any explicit quid pro quo -- a favor or advantage granted or expected in return for something -- in his call with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky. He has repeatedly referred to it as a "perfect" conversation.
But several elements of the call could conceivably have been used as bargaining chips by Mr. Trump.
One was the American military aid, which came to nearly $ 400 million for security assistance to help Ukraine fight Russian aggression on its eastern border. The other was a proposed Oval Office meeting between Mr. Zelensky and Mr. Trump, highly desired by Mr. Zelensky as a powerful show of American support at a time when Ukraine is under threat from Russia.
According to a summary of the call released by the White House, Mr. Trump raised two matters after Mr. Zelensky spoke of his need for American help. "I would like you to do us a favor, though," Mr. Trump said, shifting the conversation to ask Mr. Zelensky to investigate the Bidens as well as the conspiracy theory.
Mr. Zelensky responded that his prosecutor general would look into those issues, and asked Mr. Trump to provide any additional information that could aid in the investigation.
So what's the problem?
At its most basic level, asking another government for help -- whether a quid pro quo existed or not -- means that Mr. Trump would find himself indebted to another country.
Doing this in private is especially alarming, Mr. Potter said, because the Trump administration's decision to even temporarily withhold military aid for a country that needs to arm itself against Russia goes directly against American national security interests.
"If the president of Ukraine has agreed to do this, he has something to hold over the head of the president of the United States," Mr. Potter said. "It indeed opens the president up to political blackmail."
Is this illegal?
Asking a foreigner for aid in an American political campaign is illegal, which Ellen L. Weintraub, the head of the Federal Election Commission, has made clear.
"If a foreign government is investing resources in producing something that will be a value to a campaign here in the United States, that's a problem," Ms. Weintraub said in an interview with ABC News.
Isn't this business as usual?
No. Both Republican and Democratic presidential administrations have resisted the idea of enlisting help from foreign powers for political advantage.
In 1992, when President George Bush was behind in the polls in his re-election campaign against Bill Clinton, a group of Republican lawmakers suggested to White House officials that they ask the British and Russian governments to dig up unflattering information on Mr. Clinton's actions protesting the Vietnam War during his time in London, and to look into a visit he made to Moscow.
"They wanted us to contact the Russians or the British to seek information on Bill Clinton's trip to Moscow," James A. Baker III, Mr. Bush's chief of staff, wrote in a memo at the time. "I said we absolutely could not do that."
Ten former chiefs of staff for five former presidents -- Ronald Reagan, both Bushes, Mr. Clinton and Barack Obama -- have all said they would have considered such a prospect unacceptable.
But that doesn't mean the Russians haven't tried. The Soviet Union offered to help Adlai Stevenson make a third presidential run in 1960, a proposal he turned down. The Soviet ambassador likewise offered to help finance Hubert Humphrey's campaign in 1968, drawing another rejection. And Leonid Brezhnev told Gerald R. Ford that he would "do everything we can" to help him win in 1976, a comment Mr. Ford brushed off without taking seriously.
Doesn't the U.S. meddle in other countries?
Yes.
The Central Intelligence Agency helped overthrow elected leaders in Iran and Guatemala in the 1950s and backed violent coups in several other countries in the 1960s. It plotted assassinations and supported brutal anti-Communist governments in Latin America, Africa and Asia. The C.I.A. has planted misinformation and, at times, used cash as a way to achieve foreign policy aims.
But experts have argued that modern American efforts are not morally equivalent to those in Russia. In recent decades, American efforts have been geared toward promoting candidates who challenge authoritarian leaders. Russian efforts, on the other hand, are meant to sow discord.
"We often consider ourselves and hold ourselves out as an example of how other countries should conduct themselves," Mr. Potter said. "When we have internal battles or things have gone wrong here, it is much harder to do that."
He added, "Countries can exploit that and say, 'We may be bad, but the United States is no better."'
Has this happened in previous U.S. elections?
Sort of.
The only impeachment involving foreign policy came in the case of a senator, William Blount, who was accused in 1797 of scheming to transfer parts of Florida and the Louisiana Territory to Britain. The House impeached Blount, but he fled Washington. The Senate opted to expel him rather than convict him at trial.

Trump makes defending press freedom tougher

Texto completo: On Oct. 17, Steven Butler, the Asia program coordinator of the Committee to Protect Journalists, arrived in Lahore, Pakistan, after flying halfway around the world from Washington. He had a valid visa in his passport and a letter of invitation from the Asma Jahangir Conference, an annual human rights gathering where Butler was to be a featured speaker.
Pakistani immigration officials had other plans. They pulled Butler aside and informed him he was on an Interior Ministry "stop list." Without explanation or a chance to appeal, Butler was forced onto a return flight to Washington, which he spent in a strange sort of legal limbo. The flight crew remained in possession of his passport and boarding pass.
This treatment, as appalling as it was, was not nearly as terrible as that endured by our Africa program coordinator, Angela Quintal, and our representative Muthoki Mumo, who were detained last November while on a CPJ mission to Tanzania. Quintal and Mumo were taken from their hotel room in Dar es Salaam by intelligence agents who brought them to a secret location where they interrogated them, confiscated their electronic devices and roughed up Mumo.
I've spent more than 20 years at CPJ, the past 12 as executive director. In that time, no one from our staff had ever been detained while traveling on CPJ business. Now it's happened twice in the past year. I don't think it's a coincidence.
CPJ, which defends the rights of journalists around the world to report the news without fear of reprisal, is based in the United States and employs U.S. citizens as well as nationals of many other countries. We consider ourselves to be a part of international civil society - the network of advocacy groups, media and independent institutions that foster the free flow of information and defend basic rights. We often have an adversarial relationship with the U.S. government, because we are constantly pushing it to do more to stand up for press freedom. But we have always operated under the assumption that, if we get into trouble, the powers-that-be in Washington will have our backs.
But that's not true anymore. President Trump's rhetoric and actions are making it more difficult and dangerous for us to do our critical work. His characterization of journalists as "enemies of the people"; his fulminations against "fake news"; his indifference to the murder of Post contributing columnist Jamal Khashoggi (which Trump now refers to as an "event"); and his apparent willingness to allow the arrest of a New York Times correspondent in Egypt - all of these behaviors and actions empower autocratic leaders from around the world who are arresting and jailing journalists in record numbers.
When Trump holds news conferences with repressive foreign leaders - from Vladimir Putin of Russia to Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil - they often joke about their terrible treatment by the press. Trump apparently thinks this is amusing, but I can tell you it has real-world consequences. In July, Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan met with Trump and was asked about Pakistan's terrible press freedom record. "There's no way you're treated worse than I am," quipped Trump, as both men chuckled.
A few days later, I got an email from a Pakistani journalist complaining that "Imran Khan has returned all puffed up from his meeting with President Trump & is cracking down with greater ferocity on political opponents and media."
I will do anything to defend my staff, but the issue here is much larger. Like many U.S.-based international organizations, we use our privileged position to fight for essential principles which we believe are in the best interest of the United States and the international community. If journalists around the world are not able to report the news, how will Americans and others be informed about global events? Without independent journalism, disagreements are more likely to become conflicts, fueling instability. Global hot spots will go unnoticed; humanitarian disasters will be unobserved.
We've responded forcefully to Butler's expulsion from Pakistan. We've demanded an explanation from the Pakistani authorities and written to the Pakistani ambassador to request a meeting. We reached out to the State Department, and we were pleased that they expressed concern.
But that's not enough. While there are many people at all levels of the State Department who support our work and share our values, they don't have the backing of the president, and governments around the world know this. The State Department has also been gutted; many posts remain open, and there isn't even a U.S. ambassador to Pakistan.
Given this state of affairs, we are asking Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to make clear to Pakistani authorities that the treatment of Butler was unacceptable and that support for press freedom and the rights of journalists is an essential U.S. value. Without such an expression of support, our staff will continue to be unsafe, journalists will be vulnerable, and repressive governments around the world will have growing power to censor the news and to determine what we know.
The writer is executive director of the Committee to Protect Journalists.

Media veers from normalizing Trump

Texto completo: Although it drew little notice, Richard Engel's report from northern Syria on Sunday's "Meet the Press" struck me as stunning.
"While this is happening," the NBC chief foreign correspondent told viewers, speaking about the temporary Turkish cease-fire, "there is ethnic cleansing underway."
He acknowledged that "that is a very, very big word," but based on his reporting about the Kurds under siege, there was just no other way to say it.
And although the Engel moment was notable in its forthrightness - simply stating the facts without hedging - it wasn't the only one of its kind in recent days.
The mainstream media seems to have quietly removed its Trump-normalizing gloves in the past few weeks.
The New York Times's veteran correspondent, Peter Baker - no hothead - wrote a "White House Memo" that appeared on Saturday's print front page.
It wasn't cluttered with "critics say this" but "Trump loyalists say that."
Rather, it included straightforward, though damning, observations and facts regarding the state of Trump world on the 1,001st day of the president's tenure when "all pretense of normalcy went out the window."
"It was a day when he boasted of saving "millions of lives" by temporarily stopping a Middle East war that he effectively allowed to start in the first place, then compared the combatants to children who had to be allowed to slug each other to get it out of their system.
"It was a day when he announced without any evident embarrassment that officials of the federal government that answers to him had scoured the country for a site for next year's Group of 7 summit meeting and determined that the perfect location, the very best site in all the United States, just happened to be a property he owned in Florida."
And Baker went on to describe acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney's walk-back of his admission that there had been a quid pro quo between Trump and the Ukraine's head of state, and the insults thrown out at his Texas rally.
"I do think a corner has been turned in the way he's being covered," Nate Silver, editor in chief of FiveThirtyEight.com, the data-driven news organization, told me in a phone interview Monday.
"There's just a degree of directness in the way things are being stated that feels new."
Trump himself seems to think so - and to find it vexing to no longer be able to control the narrative.
"The President is increasingly frustrated with what he sees as his inability to communicate on impeachment," Dana Bash, a political correspondent for CNN, tweeted, citing her reporting.
Although it may seem arbitrary, I date the beginnings of this change to a Sept. 1 Washington Post report by White House reporters Philip Rucker and Ashley Parker that drew the ire of the White House.
It described Trump's "lost summer," one "defined by self-inflicted controversies and squandered opportunities."
They reviewed events:
"Trump leveled racist attacks against four congresswomen of color dubbed 'the Squad.' He derided the majority-black city of Baltimore as 'rat and rodent infested.' His anti-immigrant rhetoric was echoed in a missive that authorities believe a mass shooting suspect posted. His visits to Dayton, Ohio, and El Paso after the gun massacres in those cities served to divide rather than heal."
This kind of reporting has coincided with - or perhaps helped to spawn - a change on the Sunday morning network political shows.
Moderators are pushing back harder against administration officials - whose very presence on the shows has become far scarcer.
"Trump's allies on TV are having trouble relying on reality to defend him," was the headline on a blow-by-blow of one recent Sunday's efforts by The Post's Philip Bump.
This past weekend, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was struck awkwardly speechless under persistent questioning from ABC News's George Stephanopoulos, talking about Mulvaney's admission of a quid pro quo, as Trump held up military aid to Ukraine as he asked for dirt on his political opponents.
Pompeo tried to bill it as hypothetical - an "if it happened" situation - but as Stephanopoulos noted, "The chief of staff said it did."
Peter Wade of Rolling Stone described Pompeo's on-air reaction: "One could imagine the memes starting to multiply that would include the intro of Simon and Garfunkel's 'Sounds of Silence' playing in the background as Pompeo went quiet for a prolonged period of time."
Why is this happening now? I'll offer some possibilities.
One is that Trump has finally crossed a line, particularly - though not solely - with his recklessness in acquiescing to a Turkish invasion of northern Syria, thus abandoning America's Kurdish allies.
"The Fifth Avenue Murder Theory now faces its toughest test," wrote my colleague E.J. Dionne in a weekend column, recalling Trump's bragging in 2016 that he could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody and not lose any voters. He cites as a crack in the foundation that more than two-thirds of Republican House members joined with every Democrat in criticizing Trump's Syria move.
The other possibility is that public support for the House's impeachment inquiry may have stiffened the press's spine. A slim majority of Americans, according to recent research from Gallup, support not only impeachment but also removing Trump from office.
Silver suggests a different dynamic.
"The myth of Trump as a brilliant tactician has been punctured," he said - initially by the results of the midterm elections and then by the increasingly hard-to-defend decisions and events that have followed, which have caused even stalwart Republican loyalists to criticize him, even if only anonymously and behind the scenes.
The problem of how to cover Trump effectively - that is, in the best interests of citizens - has plagued the mainstream press since the beginning of his candidacy.
Too often, he has defined the terms. Too often, journalists have agreed to them as if there were no other choice.
If that's changing now, as I think it is, a question hangs in the fetid air.
Has too much damage already been done?

Texto completo: President Trump defended Rep. Tulsi Gabbard against allegations that she is working for Moscow to influence the U.S. presidential election.
Last week, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, 71, said Gabbard is a "Russian asset" being "groomed" by the Kremlin for a third-party presidential run that could effectively hand the 2020 election to Trump.
The president vouched for the Hawaii Democrat in a cabinet meeting on Monday and said Clinton is "sick" for making the claim.
"She's not a Russian agent," he said of Gabbard.
"She’s accusing everyone of being a Russian agent," Trump continued, referring to Clinton. "These people are sick. There's something wrong with them."
Gabbard, 38, responded on Friday to Clinton’s charge, calling the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee the "queen of warmongers."
"From the day I announced my candidacy, there has been a concerted campaign to destroy my reputation," Gabbard tweeted. "We wondered who was behind it and why. Now we know — it was always you, through your proxies and powerful allies in the corporate media and war machine, afraid of the threat I pose. It’s now clear that this primary is between you and me. Don’t cowardly hide behind your proxies. Join the race directly."
Gabbard served in a field medical unit in Iraq from 2004 to 2005 and was deployed to Kuwait from 2008 to 2009. She is still a major in the Hawaii Army National Guard. The 2020 Democratic presidential candidate took a break from the campaign trail over the summer to spend two weeks in Indonesia on a military training exercise.
Gabbard joined Congress in 2013 and sits on two House committees — the Financial Services Committee and the Armed Services Committee.

Texto completo: Amazon wants you to just love a little bit again.
The streaming service's new anthology series, "Modern Love," is based on The New York Times column about the different ways we love in the contemporary world. This can be love in a marriage, sure, but also between a paternal doorman and a tenant, a couple on a second date or any other way we express or acquire the emotion, or lose it. Or almost lose it.
The fourth and best episode of the series, "Rallying to Keep the Game Alive," is about a marriage on the verge of collapse, a husband (John Slattery) and wife (Tina Fey) who aren't sure what they will have in common after their growing children leave the house. They eventually find their way back to each other, through admitting their failures, putting the past in the past and playing a lot of tennis.
The episode is instantly relatable for those who have been in long-term relationships that require care and maintenance, and who go through rough patches that seem to have no end. Its universality makes it even more surprising that the episode is based on a column written by actor Denis Leary's wife, Ann.
Slattery's "Dennis" is an actor of at least some fame and wealth (his fabulous New York apartment and a fan encounter make that clear), and his wife, Sarah, often is aggrieved by the lifestyle of partying and affirmation that being an actor has afforded him.
But their problems are deeper than fans coming up to him in restaurants or her being kept at arms' length from the fabulous parties he attends. They're about the resentment built up between them when they didn't notice, a frustration that they can't even discuss openly at marriage counseling sessions. It isn't until they give up on therapy and share a resigned meal that the real problems they confront come to the surface, so they can start addressing them. Eventually, the rhythms of tennis help their relationship rally, quite literally.
Over its eight episodes, "Love" uncynically embraces sentiment, a tone that's welcome in some episodes and distinctly mawkish in others (the final episode's attempt to tie them all together in a saccharine montage is fully on the side of cloying and annoying). "Rallying" finds a space for a small amount of skepticism about the sheer power of love without losing a hopeful mood. It also has a sardonic humor that's distinctly missing in other episodes.
The notion that no amount of money or fame can solve love's limits is reassuring. We all struggle, but some of us overcome and "stay in the game."

THE PULL OF EXTREMISM WHITE NATIONALISM IS GROWING AND DIVIDING

Texto completo: "Screw your optics."
Those were among the last words posted online by Robert Bowers before he attacked the Tree of Life synagogue on Oct. 27, according to the federal indictment against him.
Those words were also a reflection of a debate that has split the white nationalist movement for years but has rarely reached the general public's eye. The reactions to Mr. Bowers' final post reveal much about that movement's direction since then.
The "optics debate" pits those who say they want to achieve a white-only or white-dominated nation through persuasion and politics against others - some calling themselves accelerationists - who want to start a race war as soon as possible.
To some of the former, the Tree of Life massacre was "strategically stupid," as one put it in an audio blog.
For others, though, that last post became a meme. A search for Twitter posts including "screw your optics" reveals 42 of them in August alone - a full nine months after the phrase was coined - including tweets dealing with white nationalism and mass killings, but also some broadly referencing U.S. or European politics, or topics as mundane as gardening and the decision to get contact lenses. A Google search, meanwhile, revealed at least 40 images captioned with some version of "screw your optics."
The Tree of Life massacre didn't end the "optics debate." But it may have shifted the balance as it reverberated through the increasingly networked white nationalist and supremacist movements in the U.S., Europe and the Australian subcontinent.
Some who study the white identity movement say that it continues to gain momentum and stridency, even as the media and many politicians decry violence perpetrated in its name at Tree of Life, Christchurch in New Zealand, El Paso, Texas, and elsewhere.
In the past year, "things have just gotten so much worse," said John Horgan, a psychology professor at Georgia State University who researches terrorism and violent extremism. Ethnic, racial and religious incitement "is insidious. It's pervasive. And it seems to be becoming an attractive counterculture to an increasing number of young people."
From 'amnats' to Atomwaffen
White supremacy today is "on the resurgence," said Kathleen Blee, distinguished professor of sociology and dean of the Dietrich School of Arts and Sciences at the University of Pittsburgh. She traces the growth in the movement to the ease of participation through web forums and social media and in part to the election of President Barack Obama. "What propels white supremacy historically is threat," she said. "The idea that the white race is imperiled by a black presidency. That threat started mobilizing people."
White supremacy today is also distinguished by the prevalence of the "great replacement theory" - the idea that there is a plot, masterminded by Jews, to replace whites with other races. The theory has caught fire among white supremacists in the last decade or so, said Ms. Blee, and was referenced by name by the shooters in Christchurch, El Paso, and at a synagogue in Poway, Calif., near San Diego.
"There's a clear structure to how this works, and what this ideology does is that it focuses attention on certain groups as the enemy and makes the issue seem very, very urgent," she said. "That's the fear part. The race war is going to start right now. The threat is immediate, urgent and that action can be taken. Bowers and many other people buy into that."
What the FBI calls "racially motivated violent extremism" - including anti-Semitism and crime driven by bias related to gender identity - is on the rise nationally and locally, said John Pulcastro, a supervisory intelligence analyst with the bureau's Pittsburgh office. He can't quantify the prevalence of extremism but said that the numbers of acts, tips and preventive interventions have risen, especially since 2017's Unite the Right Rally in Charlottesville, Va.
"It's a major focus of our intelligence unit right now and it's a national threat priority for the FBI nationally as a whole," said Mr. Pulcastro, who has spent 20 of his 30 years with the bureau working on extremism cases.
Optics - the way things look - may not have mattered to white nationalists a century ago, when the movement was epitomized by hooded Ku Klux Klan members and burning crosses. In 2017, though, initial images from Charlottesville conveyed a much different impression - clean-cut young men in polos and khakis, holding tiki torches. Advocates for "optics" won that day.
Only the next morning did the Nazi and Confederate flags appear, followed at the end by some very bad optics - video of a car driven by neo-Nazi James Fields plowing through counterprotesters and killing Heather D. Heyer, 32.
"After Charlottesville there was a huge debate about optics," wrote one self-described American Nationalist, who communicated with the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette in September and October and is profiled in a companion piece on this page. He characterized a divide between "pretenders who want to look tough wearing swastikas, and yell about killing people" and "actual White American Nationalists who disavow violence, promote change through policy, care about America, and refuse to dress up like some costumed freak to gain attention."
His side, he wrote, has "rules such as: If anyone tries to get you to do something illegal or tells you that they're gonna do something illegal, that person gets cut off immediately and forever."
Requests for comment from the other side of the optics debate resulted in long streams of mocking, often vulgar and sometimes threatening social media posts including references to shooting and raping journalists, pictures in which guns are pointed at the viewer and name-calling like "filthy dumb journo scum."
In the days after the Tree of Life massacre, the New York-based Network Contagion Research Institute turned its computer analysis tools to the use of the word "optics" on Gab.com, on which Mr. Bowers posted. "Optics" was closely associated with "infight" and with these extremist terms:
* wn, short for white nationalism, or the desire for a "white homeland."
* amnat, short for American nationalism, an avowedly nonracist reaction to globalism.
* civnat, a far-right term for moderate-to-conservative whites.
* Atomwaffen, a violent neo-Nazi clique.
* blackpill, a term for the act of pushing another person deep into nihilism.
Also associated closely with "optics" was the acronym gtkrwn - extremist code for "gas the kikes, race war now," said Joel Finkelstein, the director of the NCRI, which uses technology to study racism and anti-Semitism.
"When [Mr. Bowers] is talking about optics and passing it off as bravado to the public," said Mr. Finkelstein, "he's telling his own community that, 'we're ready to have a coming out party, and this is it.'"
The FBI, said Mr. Pulcastro, urges the public to be alert to the provocative word "invasion" in reference to immigration, the term "blood and soil," and the 14-word creed of white extremists: "We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children."
According to Mr. Finkelstein, "screw your optics" put Mr. Bowers solidly into the pantheon of far-right accelerationists.
"Bowers is kind of a meme now," he said. "He's not just a guy. He's a thing to do."
'Then we'll have our way'
From the outside, it may seem ridiculous that slaughtering aging Jews at worship in Pittsburgh or Hispanic shoppers in El Paso could advance any cause. Some fringe figures, though, saw it as a win for the far side of the optics debate.
One Gab poster early this year called Mr. Bowers "a good person who snapped, because of all the Anti-White [stuff] going on," according to the Tampa Bay Times. That post is reportedly attributed to Daniel McMahon, a Tampa-area man who frequently went by the name Jack Corbin online. Mr. Bowers repeatedly shared Jack Corbin posts before the Tree of Life massacre, according to the Network Contagion Research Institute.
In September, federal prosecutors in Charlottesville indicted Mr. McMahon, 31, for electronically intimidating an African American man into dropping a bid for a seat on that city's council.
Screwing the optics makes perfect sense to some self-described accelerationists, who believe that provoking society and speeding its decline is the surest path to a white nation, said Peter Simi, an associate professor of sociology at Chapman University in Irvine, Calif., and author of "American Swastika: Inside the White Power Movement's Hidden Spaces of Hate."
The term "accelerationist" originally referred to people who believe that ever-speeding technological and social change can prompt painful - but ultimately desirable - change. In recent years, some on the right fringe have adopted the term.
The rightist accelerationist logic, Mr. Simi said, is that by repeatedly damaging the prevailing system, they "can get to this total collapse, 'and then we'll have our way.'"
Those accelerationists have gained urgency from anti-immigrant rhetoric in politics and the media, experts agreed.
"Their view is, we don't need to just act, we need to act now, rather than later, because if we don't act, our very way of life is at risk," said Mr. Horgan, the Georgia State psychology professor. "We can't wait because we are being invaded."
Since Tree of Life, Poway and the Christchurch mosque massacre in New Zealand - before which the accused echoed "screw your optics" in his online posts - Mr. Simi has seen the emergence of a discussion thread more chilling than the optics conversation.
"I saw discussion that was very, kind of, strategic about how the person got radicalized, how they could have been more effective in terms of killing more people - this kind of after-incident assessment," he said.
International nationalism
The Anti-Defamation League counted 18 known attacks or plots by white supremacists in the U.S. between Oct. 27 and mid-September. Several were anti-Semitic, including Poway, in which a 19-year-old, following a script chillingly reminiscent of Tree of Life, killed one and injured three before his gun jammed.
Bari Weiss, New York Times columnist and author of the recently released book "How to Fight Anti-Semitism," still calls modern American Jews "the luckiest diaspora in Jewish history." Compared with anti-Semitism in Europe, "the cancer here is at stage 1 rather than at stage 4," she said. Ms. Weiss grew up in Squirrel Hill and celebrated her bat mitzvah at Tree of Life.
"In no way did I think that what happened in Pittsburgh would happen in America," she said. "I thought that violent anti-Semitism was something that happened in other places."
But white nationalism has become more overtly international.
"We had European white supremacists marching in Charlottesville, and American white supremacists marching in Poland," said Jonathan Greenblatt, CEO and national director of the ADL. "White supremacy is a global terror threat."
Organizations on both sides of the Atlantic are increasingly networked, according to an ADL report released in September.
Americans have attended far-right events and conferences in Poland and Scandinavia, the ADL and partner organizations reported. A few prominent figures from the movement even took up temporary residence in Hungary, where anti-immigrant Prime Minister Viktor Orbán has emerged as a hero to xenophobes. And U.S.-based groups like Women for Aryan Unity have established chapters in Europe.
On Oct. 9, the suspected gunman in the Yom Kippur synagogue attack in Halle, Germany, livestreamed the attack on the Amazon-owned Twitch platform, narrating his actions in English in an apparent attempt at maximizing exposure. The Halle gunman failed to enter the synagogue, and then killed two and injured two others nearby.
The video was removed quickly by Twitch but had already been downloaded and copied to Telegram, an encrypted messaging app favored by extremists.

WESTERN PA. SEES TRICKLE OF SPENDING FROM CANDIDATES AREA MAY BE KEY TO PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION IN 2020

Texto completo: In the third fundraising quarter of 2019, candidates for president spent more than $158 million, just a few months out from the nation's first primary contests.
But only $6,000 of their campaign dollars flowed through Western Pennsylvania, a key electoral area that political analysts say could be one of the most important in the country in 2020. And of that amount, at least $4,000 of the spending in the Pittsburgh area was courtesy of a Democratic candidate who dropped out of the race during the quarter.
The candidates' new fundraising reports - covering the period from July 1 to Sept. 30 - revealed their spending across the country on everything from staff salaries and data to hotel rooms and meals. It also showed Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren leading the Democratic field in fundraising, bringing in $33.7 million and $25.7 million respectively. South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg followed in third with $23.3 million.
Mr. Sanders' campaign was the only current one to visit Pittsburgh during the quarter, though no spending details were listed on his campaign finance report.
His campaign led the Democratic field with $21.5 million in spending, which included $5.6 million in salaries, $3.7 million on advertising and nearly $1 million on campaign merchandise.
Mr. Sanders paid a salary to Robert Burns, whose residency was listed on the report as being in Pittsburgh, but the campaign said Mr. Burns is a regional field director in New Hampshire.
The Sanders campaign also listed a $539.97 expense at The Carvery, the buffet and salad bar inside Meadows Casino in Washington, Pa. But that, too, can't be claimed as Pittsburgh spending because it was a mistaken entry, a Sanders campaign spokesman said. The disbursement was actually for sandwiches from a shop of a similar name in Michigan, before the senator boarded a bus from Detroit to Canada to purchase cheaper insulin with people with Type I diabetes.
Ms. Warren's campaign spent $18.6 million across the country in the quarter, allowing her to bankroll a staff of well over 500 people and a $3.2 million digital operation. She spent $441.50 at the United States Bankruptcy Court on Grant Street, earmarked for "research." A similar transaction popped up for "research" at a bankruptcy court in Wilmington, Del.
The Warren campaign could not be reached for comment on the transaction, but the bankruptcy court allows the public to access docket sheets for bankruptcy courts and proceedings at 10 cents per page or to buy audio recordings of hearings at $31 per CD, among other offers.
According to an August story by the Associated Press, Ms. Warren - a bankruptcy expert and consumer watchdog - has traveled to federal courthouses since she was a young scholar to gather statistics on why people were going bankrupt. In the early 1980s, she joined two of her colleagues in visiting bankruptcy courts in Pennsylvania, Illinois and Texas, reading through more than 1,500 bankruptcy filings.
Mr. Buttigieg hasn't visited Pittsburgh yet, but his campaign spent more than $400 on event supplies from Dick Sporting Goods, which is headquartered in Coraopolis.
Though he's made official White House visits to the region, Mr. Trump's re-election campaign didn't swing through this past quarter. The president will be here Wednesday to speak at the annual Shale Insight conference at the David L. Lawrence Convention Center, Downtown.
California Sen. Kamala Harris, who had $10.5 million cash on hand at the end of the quarter, had a transaction in the area: $200 of parking at a meter company headquartered in Warrendale.
Congressman Tim Ryan's campaign, near the bottom of the fundraising pack, listed seven transactions for parking at Pittsburgh International Airport totaling more than $600, as well as more than $250 in shipping costs at a FedEx post office box out of Pittsburgh. His district in northeast Ohio is about an hour's drive from Downtown.
Much of the Western Pennsylvania spending came from New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, who dropped out of the Democratic primary race in late August.
Ms. Gillibrand racked up about $4,000 in costs stemming from a visit to Oakland in July; more than $200 for travel and office supplies at a CVS store on Forbes Avenue; $400 at Hilton Garden Inn in Oakland for event catering and site costs; $1,160 for travel costs at the Pittsburgh Marriott City Center; $1,000 for printing at Print and Copy Center Inc. in Verona; $860 for car rentals at the airport; and $470 for meals and catering at The Porch, a restaurant in Schenley Plaza.

Texto completo: "Giselle" is a bittersweet story. Woven throughout the ballet is the joy that comes with discovering something (or someone) you love and the sadness of letting go.
It's a fitting choice to open Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre's 2019-20 season, its 50th, next weekend at Benedum Center with the PBT Orchestra. While celebrating this golden anniversary, the company is also getting ready to say goodbye to longtime artistic director Terrence Orr and principal dancer Luca Sbrizzi.
Mr. Orr announced during this summer that he will step down as artistic director at the end of the season, making this the fifth and final time he'll present "Giselle" in his 20-plus years with PBT.
"I think it's probably my favorite ballet in a way," he says. "It has a wonderful piece of music that's not known to be by one of the famous composers. It has an incredible story that's very much like 'Romeo and Juliette,' but people don't see it that way."
The Paris Opera Ballet premiered "Giselle" in 1841 with choreography by Jean Coralli and Jules Perrot and music from Adolphe Adam. Later, it was updated with revisions by 19th-century French choreographer Marius Petipa.
Set in a village in Germany, it follows the unlikely love story of nobleman Count Albrecht and Giselle, a peasant maiden. Meanwhile, a huntsman and gamekeeper named Hilarion also has fallen for Giselle. She later learns, though, that Albrecht has pledged to marry someone else, and she dies of a broken heart.
In the second act, Giselle is destined to join the Wilis, a group of female spirits jilted in life who now haunt the forest and any man in their path. But Giselle's bond with Albrecht continues beyond the grave.
Mr. Orr has a soft sport for this ballet because his wife, PBT ballet mistress Marianna Tcherkassky, had the title role as a principal dancer with American Ballet Theatre. He says The New York Times called her "one of the greatest Giselles of our time."
PBT last staged the ballet in 2016 with fresh scenery and new costumes and staging by Mr. Orr. To help dancers dig even deeper into the emotion-packed plot this time, Mr. Orr invited dramaturg and friend Byam Stevens to work with them for a week.
"I've known his family - they're all involved with American Ballet Theatre - and that's probably where I first knew him," Mr. Orr says. "That's been easily more than 50 years."
Like Mr. Orr, Mr. Sbrizzi ranks "Giselle" among his favorite ballets. When he learned PBT would revive it, he postponed his retirement from last spring until this month so he could dance the role of Albrecht again.
"I'm super fortunate and lucky that I'm able to go out with a ballet I love and respect so much," he says.
A native of Udine, Italy, Mr. Sbrizzi danced with Boston Ballet II before joining PBT in 2007. He was promoted to principal in 2016. Exiting the company was a decision that he's been "thinking about for quite some time," he says. His wife, Jenna, is pregnant with their first child, who's due in November. Mr. Sbrizzi plans to work in massage therapy after earning his license in it several years ago.
"I feel like my career has been fully satisfied, and I want to retire when I'm still feeling good and healthy," says Mr. Sbrizzi, 33. "I don't want to have issues later on in life because I pushed the career for too long."
He credits Mr. Orr for making his time with PBT a positive experience.
"He's really taken me under his wing from the very beginning. He's coached me through the ranks," he says. "He's allowed me to do all the roles I wanted to do and ever desired to do."
In "Giselle," he'll be partnered with principal Alexandra Kochis, whose husband, Christopher Budzynski, made his final PBT performance in the 2016 production of "Giselle."
Despite the impending retirements, it's been business as usual around the studio and in rehearsals.
"I think that, of course, is in the back of everybody's mind, but we've honestly been so busy and have such an incredible lineup of ballets to be performing this season," Ms. Kochis says.
"Terry gets so excited about ballet, and he's just so passionate about passing on what excites him."

Texto completo: Want to survive the apocalypse? Check out the listings on LuxuryBunkerSwap.com.
"Larry Hall touts his condominium's high ceilings and spacious living rooms. Then there are the swimming pool, saunas and movie theater. But what really sets the development apart, in his view, is its ability to survive the apocalypse." (The New York Times)

Exquisite perch over smoldering ashes, available for swap or short-term rental
Climb 30 feet down the maple-handled ladder, open the two-foot-thick steel door and behold an awe-inspiring vista of life to come: a semicircle of glass providing expansive views of dirt. Which you've inherited! It's just one more reminder that you're living in luxury and everyone else is dead. In the kitchen, Bosch, Viking and the Vitamix Pro Series blender are the brands that will delight your eyes and palate until food runs out. Which it won't! This place comes stocked with food that would make an astronaut wet his suit: gourmet, freeze-dried, nourishing and easily paired with a selection of wines kept in our underground cellar (extra charge). B.Y.O.W. -- bring your own weapons. Seeking house swap in Switzerland.
Penthouse, pet-friendly, kid-friendly, cannon
My wife and I handpicked each amenity so you'll live in style when missiles rain hellfire on the unholy sinners. Then, in the interest of full disclosure, I cheated on Marge and she left. So I'll be honest and state the obvious: This place is big for me. I'd swap our 922 square feet for something smaller and I'm willing to "take a bath," meaning that I prefer a place with a tub. We have a massive yard perfect for dogs or kids, provided you're willing to go outside, which, you probably shouldn't. Gas masks not provided. But a step-by-step looting guide to the nearby restaurants, fish-and-tackle-store and ice-cream shop is. And to my former wife, Marge: If you're reading this, I may yet be the last man alive on Earth. So I guess that means there's a chance for us.

Heaven on Earth for the deserving true believer
When the messiah returns to wreak vengeance on the unholy, what you want -- what you've earned -- is the right to feel superior, in comfort. This bunker sits high on a hill, allowing you to look down on the charred remains of town and the starving masses you now rule. Plus, it has stainless steel appliances, brick pizza oven and a generator-powered media center. With multiple closed-circuit camera feeds and surround-sound speaker system to drown out the screaming of those who failed to plan ahead.
End of days, high-tech quarters
Humanity is obsolete, but your amenities aren't! This beautiful bunker in Silicon Valley is built to withstand a nuclear blast but, more important, features technology upgrades that will impress even your 15-year-old. Everything here is next-next generation, including a self-driving car that knows every square inch of your 1,100 square feet. Voice-activated appliances, audio-video system and bathroom faucets are so lifelike you'll forget you may be alone on Earth. Comes with Wi-Fi and dedicated cellular backup if there's anyone left to call to complain about the sounds of suffering from above. Batteries not included.

Digital Nomads Require Connections

Texto completo: Sure, being able to work remotely and travel nonstop is a blast. But it's not without downtime and difficult moments.
For most of the last five years I've lived as a digital nomad, working while traveling for months at a time across dozens of countries and five continents. For the most part, this is as fun as it sounds. It isn't, however, an unbroken chain of big beach umbrellas, little drink umbrellas and a few scattered minutes spent working. You have the occasional bad day. Working in a humid hostel with dial-up internet speeds, worrying about deadlines and that meeting scheduled for 4 a.m. can take the glamour out of it all.
In the end, though, it's worth it. Here are some tricks I've learned to keep those bad days to a minimum.
No one understands what you are doing
No matter how much you have explained it, no one will truly get it. The mind-set of "work" only being possible in an office, and only having two weeks each year for vacation, is pervasive (and in my opinion, troubling). You are going to have to make an extra effort to maintain relationships, both work and personal. Be wary of boss changes as well. Just because your old boss did not mind you working remotely does not mean their replacement understands why you are Skyping into meetings from Chiang Mai, Thailand.
Always be on the lookout for new work
This is especially important for freelancers, but employees need to think about it, too. My father taught me that you're going to lose 10 percent of your clients each year just through unavoidable attrition. So if you are not finding new work, you're going to make less money every year. Or if you are an employee and your boss says come home now or you are fired -- well, what's that choice look like? A solid backup plan, multiple regular clients, or both, are really the only safe way to be a digital nomad, wherever you are, whether New York City or Hong Kong.
Make new friends
As an introvert, this was the part I found most difficult as a digital nomad. The thing is, it's rather vital. Isolation is not good for mental health.
The turning point for me was when I realized that nearly everyone staying in a hostel is there by themselves and most want someone else to make the first introduction. Just simply asking where someone is from can lead to a fascinating conversation. Or not. That's fine too. If you don't make a new friend today, you probably will tomorrow.
Embrace the cloud
Though you cannot entirely prevent hard drive crashes or theft, you can minimize the destructive effects by using Google Drive, Apple iCloud or one of the options recommended by Wirecutter, the New York Times company that reviews products and services. Having a cloud-based backup means that even if you lose your computer, your work will be safe. This has saved me numerous times. I can't imagine being a digital nomad without it.
Self-care
Living on a strict budget is the main way most digital nomads keep the party going. That means choosing hostels over hotels, and, often, instant ramen over sushi. But sometimes you need a hotel and some sushi. Not feeling guilty about that splurge is one of the key aspects to enjoying that splurge. Having a day to relax in the quiet, or soaking in a hot tub, or really whatever you need to reset -- sometimes you just need to do exactly that.
It's a marathon, not a sprint
Slow down. One of the biggest mistakes I made early on was moving too often. Now my general rule is no less than three nights in any one place. If the place feels right, has good food and has a convenient place to work, I'll stay longer. But that's me. You'll have to figure out how many days are right for you. It might take some time, though, to recalibrate to a slower travel speed.

Texto completo: Mark Hurd, co-chief executive of Oracle and former CEO of Hewlett-Packard, died Friday. He was 62.
Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison announced Hurd's death in an online post Friday. Hurd had taken a leave of absence from the company in September for unspecified medical reasons, saying only that he needed to focus on his health.
"Oracle has lost a brilliant and beloved leader who personally touched the lives of so many of us during his decade at Oracle," Ellison said in a statement. "I will miss his kindness and sense of humor."
Hurd had been with Oracle for almost 10 years, first as co-president along with Safra Catz beginning in September 2010. In 2014, Hurd and Catz became co-CEOs at Oracle when Ellison stepped down from the post and took on the role of chairman and head of technology. At the time, Hurd was given control of Oracle's sales, service and marketing departments, while Catz oversaw the company's operations, legal and finance areas.
Hurd's death elicited sentiment from multiple corners of the tech sector.
Salesforce founder and co-CEO Marc Benioff, who started his tech career at Oracle, said on Twitter he was saddened of the news.
"He was always very kind to me & I always enjoyed seeing him at the Warriors (games) at Oracle Arena," Benioff tweeted. "All of my thoughts and prayers are with his family & employees of Oracle."
Tim Bajarin, president of tech research firm Creative Strategies, called Hurd "one of the smartest CEOs I ever met."
"He was highly intelligent, very detailed and I was always impressed with his leadership skills," Bajarin, said. "His time at HP was important as he helped stabilize the company when it was going through a difficult transition, and at Oracle he helped the company continue its strong growth."
Hurd first made his mark on Silicon Valley when he joined HP in 2005 after a quarter century at NCR, which had culminated in a two-year stint as the ATM maker and payment system company's CEO. His tenure at HP began at a tumultuous time for the computer maker, which had just forced then-CEO Carly Fiorina to resign.
At HP, Hurd was known as an aggressive cost-cutter and oversaw the slashing of more than 15,000 jobs soon after taking the CEO position. However, under Hurd's watch, HP cemented its place as the world's top desktop and laptop computer maker and also strengthened its position in the printer market. The company increased its earnings in 22 consecutive quarters during Hurd's tenure.
Tech industry analysts weighed in on Hurd's death. Dan Ives, managing director at Wedbush Securities, called Hurd a "tech legend" and said his death was "tragic."
"Mark was one of the visionaries in the technology landscape and helped change the paradigm of enterprise hardware buying forever," Ives said. "The world lost a tech giant and a good person for those that had the pleasure to spend time with him."
Hurd's time at HP was not without controversy, however. In 2006, HP went through what was called the "pretexting" scandal, in which the company used outside investigators to look into board members and some reporters in order to determine the source of a leak to the media. As part of the incident, Hurd replaced Patricia Dunn as HP's board chairman.
Hurd was forced to resign from HP in 2010 because of his relationship with a marketing contractor for the company. An investigation by the company into Hurd's behavior determined he did not violate HP's sexual harassment policies but that he had failed to adhere to company standards by altering expense reports to conceal the interactions.
A month after leaving HP, Hurd was back atop the Silicon Valley corporate ranks, thanks to Ellison, his good friend and tennis partner.
Ellison, who hired Hurd to be Oracle's co-president, had not concealed his disdain for HP's decision to force his friend out of the CEO job. In a letter to the New York Times at the time of Hurd's ousting, Ellison wrote that HP's board had "just made the worst personnel decision since the idiots on the Apple board fired Steve Jobs many years ago."
"Hurd had his strengths and weaknesses," said Rob Enderle, president to tech research firm the Enderle Group. "However, at Oracle he had been nothing but an asset."
Hurd, who lived in Atherton, is survived by his wife, Paula and their two daughters.

David Brooks: If it’s Trump vs. Warren, then what? Vote Warren.

Texto completo: This is a memo for the politically homeless. It’s a memo to those of us who could never support Donald Trump but think the Bernie-Squad-Warren Democratic Party is sprinting too far left. It’s a memo built around the following question: If the general election campaign turns out to be Trump vs. Warren, what the heck are we supposed to do?
The first thing we could do, of course, is pray for a miracle. Maybe the Democrats will nominate one of the five B’s or the K: Biden, Buttigieg, Booker, Bennet, Bullock or Klobuchar.
These candidates are pluralists, not purists. They make many voters who disagree with them feel heard and respected. They practice the craft of politics, building majority coalitions to get things done.
If the party nominated one of those six, you really could see the Democrats gather progressives and moderates into an enduring majority coalition as the Republicans recede into old, white, rural obsolescence. You could see movement on a range of issues where large majorities are already stacked on one side: guns, climate change, reducing income inequality, expanding health coverage.
But right now, Elizabeth Warren has the momentum, and so those of us who feel politically homeless may face a stark choice.
For many, supporting Warren is too high a price to pay, even for ousting Trump. “There is no universe where I will ever vote for Donald Trump, and there is no universe where I could ever vote for Elizabeth Warren,” Jennifer Horn, a former chairwoman of the New Hampshire GOP, told The Washington Examiner.
And you can see why so many people have that reaction.
First, there are Warren’s policies. On trade, she’s a protectionist. Her 10-year, $34 trillion health care plan isn’t paid for. Her student debt cancellation plan is a handout to the upper middle class. Her campaign seems to not acknowledge the inevitable trade-off between economic growth and high spending, high taxes and high regulation.
Second, she’s one of the few Democrats who could actually lose. As Yascha Mounk notes in The Atlantic, Democrats won in 2018 because they won back a lot of nonpartisan suburban office park workers who found moderates they could vote for. When you remind independents of Democratic support for abolishing private health insurance and decriminalizing unauthorized border crossing — two key Warren policies — they become six percentage points less likely to vote for the Democrats. Trump will tell voters: You may despise me, but she’ll destroy the economy.
Third, a Warren presidency would be deeply polarizing and probably unsuccessful. Warren’s policy ideas would make any progressive-moderate coalition impossible. She’d try to govern with her 40% partisan base, just as Trump has, which is no way to pass big legislation.
Fourth, there is a wave of insular intolerance coursing through parts of the American left. If given executive power, some progressives may use it to cancel any culture or faith other than their own.
And yet ….
And yet, if it comes to Trump vs. Warren in a general election, the only plausible choice is to support Warren. Over the past month, Donald Trump has given us fresh reminders of the unique and exceptional ways he corrupts American life. You’re either part of removing that corruption or you are not. When your nation’s political system is in danger, staying home and not voting is not a responsible option.
Politics is downstream from morality and culture. Warren represents a policy wrong turn, in my view, but policies can be argued about and reversed. Trump represents a much more important and fundamental threat — to the norms, values, standards and soul of this country.
Last week, Trump all but greenlighted the ethnic cleansing of Kurds without an ounce of remorse. He normalizes dishonesty and valorizes cruelty. His letter to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan reminds us yet again that we have a president whose professional competence is at kindergarten level. Once a nation has lost its heart, mind and soul, it is very hard to get these things back.
Furthermore, Trump is an unprecedented threat to democratic institutions. Over the past few years, I’ve thought the progressive fears of incipient American fascism were vastly overblown. But, especially over the past month, Trump has worked overtime to validate those fears and to raise the horrifying specter of what he’ll be like if he is given a second term and is vindicated, unhinged and unwell.
In their book “How Democracies Die,” Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt argue that authoritarians undermine democracy in several ways. They reject the democratic rules of the game, the unwritten norms we rely upon to make the political system work. They deny the legitimacy of their political opponents, using extreme language to deny them standing as co-citizens. They tolerate or even encourage violence, threatening to take legal action against critics in rival parties.
Trump has been guilty of all three sins, and given a second term he will feel free to stomp where up until now he has merely tread.
This election is about whether we can hold together as a functioning nation, across our economic, racial, geographic and ideological divides. In such circumstances, a bad option is better than a suicidal one.

Trump in tailspin – and dragging US down with him

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — The most powerful office in the world is occupied — and being abused — by a man who is entirely unfit and is spinning dangerously out of control. Everyone needs to stop pretending otherwise.
And it's all getting worse.
President Trump's train wreck of a performance Wednesday, at a meeting with congressional leaders, represented a new low on a scale that seems to have no bottom.
"I pray for the president all the time ... I think now, we have to pray for his health," House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said later, because "this was a very serious meltdown on the part of the president."
Trump began by complaining about having to attend a meeting initiated by his own White House aides, according to published accounts.
The subject was Trump's sudden decision to move U.S. military personnel in Syria aside, allowing Turkish troops and affiliated militias to sweep across the border and attack the Kurds, who had been loyal U.S. allies.
Trump then tried to make the case that he did not actually condone the Turkish invasion. Attendees were given copies of a truly bizarre and alarming letter Trump had sent to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Oct. 9.
Just four short paragraphs long, the letter begins, "Let's work out a good deal!" It ends by telling Erdogan, "History will look upon you favorably if you get this done the right and humane way. It will look upon you forever as the devil if good things don't happen. Don't be a tough guy. Don't be a fool! I will call you later."
That is how the president of the United States communicated with a powerful foreign leader at a moment of crisis. We have all witnessed more sophisticated attempts at persuasion on kindergarten playgrounds. Erdogan reportedly threw the letter in the trash.
At the White House meeting, Trump went on to denigrate James Mattis, the decorated and highly esteemed Marine Corps general who served as Trump's defense secretary before resigning last year over Syria policy. Mattis is "the world's most overrated general," Trump announced, according to The New York Times. "You know why? He wasn't tough enough. I captured ISIS. Mattis said it would take two years. I captured them in one month."
Anyone in touch with reality knows that none of this is true. The territory held by ISIS — the Islamic State — was reclaimed by Kurdish fighters with the aid and guidance of U.S. troops and intelligence operatives.
Shortly before the meeting, the House voted 354-60 to condemn Trump's abandonment of the Kurds, with most Republicans joining their Democratic colleagues in expressing outrage.
Senators, pay attention.
You may prefer to let voters judge Trump in next year's election.
But you must realize, at this point, that we may not have that long.

Texto completo: An Op-Ed by a retired admiral strongly criticizing President Trump brought a reader to tears, "when contrasted so starkly with the dishonor and hubris emanating from the White House."
To the Editor:
Re "We're Under Attack From the President," by William H. McRaven, a retired Navy admiral (Op-Ed, Oct. 18):
The poignant article by Admiral McRaven, describing the honor and humility of the military that he knows so well, brought me to tears when contrasted so starkly with the dishonor and hubris emanating from the White House.
There is not one area of my life that has not been sullied by the tampering of the White House and the Republican Senate. As the niece of two Marines who perished at Iwo Jima and Guadalcanal, and the daughter of the last surviving son who served his duty stateside, I am dismayed to my core at the dishonor brought to the title of commander in chief and the dark shadow that he casts on our military, our allies and our citizens.

Texto completo: News item: What was initially reported on Sunday as a shooting-in-progress inside the Town Center mall in Boca Raton was downgraded to a “suspicious incident,” the Boca Raton Police reported the next day.
Initial reports of multiple rounds fired and one person shot and wounded inside the mall drew a dramatic law enforcement response from SWAT teams with the Palm Beach and Broward county sheriff’s offices, Delray Beach and Boynton Beach police and the FBI, as well as officers from the Florida Atlantic University Police Department and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.
The initial reports were revised on Monday to disclose that there was no evidence of gunfire and that the wounded person sustained his injuries by running into a door.
By Tuesday, police concluded that surveillance videos showed the “suspicious incident” was created when a janitor rolling a garbage cart through the mall’s food court encountered a balloon on the floor and popped it.
The balloon’s popping sound created the ensuing panic, police said.

Texto completo: New York finally turns the page.
Rikers Island, New York's most notorious jail, is a decrepit monument to an era of mass incarceration that robbed generations of black, Hispanic and other Americans of their humanity.
It is scheduled to close by the end of 2026.
On Thursday, the City Council voted to build four jails across the city, a critical step toward making the closing of Rikers a reality. The plan it approved will further shrink the capacity of the city's jails from about 22,000 to around 3,800.
The vote came amid a raucous scene in Lower Manhattan. Protesters passionately opposed to building any new jails chained themselves to the City Hall gates. One group of Chinatown residents implored Councilwoman Margaret Chin to vote against rebuilding the jail in their district. Police officers stood by with plastic cuffs.
But inside City Hall, the loudest voices were of those who supported the plan: a motley, excited group of city officials, community activists and family members and friends of those people who had been incarcerated.
Helping to grease the wheels, Mayor Bill de Blasio and the Council speaker, Corey Johnson, offered roughly $ 265 million for criminal justice reform, education and mental health. In the end, all four Council members whose districts will have the jails voted yes, along with a majority of their colleagues.
Councilwoman Diana Ayala, who voted in favor of building a jail in her Bronx district, said she cast her vote in honor of a younger brother who, she said, struggled with mental illness and has been in and out of jails, including Rikers. "We abandoned him," Ms. Ayala said. "We abandoned him as a city."
Ms. Chin, who faced some of the fiercest opposition, said it was a matter of conscience. "My duty as a City Council member cannot end at the edge of Lower Manhattan," she said. "This is the right thing to do."
Mr. Johnson gave a rousing speech calling Rikers "a stain on New York City." It was met with shouts of "Amen!"
As Mr. Johnson paused to acknowledge the group of activists who fought to close Rikers and were formerly incarcerated on the island, rows of men and women stood up in the chamber's soaring balcony, drawing loud applause.
In the early 1990s, when I was a kid in Brooklyn, such a scene would have been unthinkable. Crime surged, and a crack cocaine epidemic swept across the city. Then, there were 21,000 people in the city's jails. Policing and incarceration seemed to be the answer to everything that ailed New York. Research now suggests that incarcerating people accused of, or convicted of, minor crimes does little to prevent crime, and may even contribute to it. Nearly 80 percent of people incarcerated in the city's jails haven't been convicted of a crime.
During those years, my public school took a class field trip to a Brooklyn police precinct. Several of us have a vague memory of standing outside a group of cells. As I remember it, we were lined up in a row as an officer walked by us, cautioning that at least some of us could end up in a cell one day. I was 5, maybe 6, years old.
I didn't set foot on Rikers Island until I took a tour this month. I immediately realized that even as a native New Yorker, my understanding of the city I love was incomplete. The sprawling complex of dilapidated trailers and dangerous labyrinths of cells is a blight. It is a place of violence and injustice sitting in the East River for all to see, but that most of us can ignore.
The city jails now hold just 7,100 people, a population that is projected to fall to 3,300 over the next several years. Crime is at record lows. Standing on Rikers Island, that kind of math hurts. Thinking about those people who were unnecessarily incarcerated, one is overwhelmed by the lost human potential.
That includes Kalief Browder, the 16-year-old teenager who spent three years on Rikers Island after being accused of stealing a backpack. It includes Layleen Polanco, a transgender woman who died at Rikers after being placed in a unit that is effectively solitary confinement. It includes Jerome Murdough, a mentally ill veteran who died from heat exposure in a Rikers cell in 2014.
This vote was for them.

Texto completo: El jefe interino del gabinete del presidente Donald Trump, Mick Mulvaney, reconoció este jueves en una conferencia de prensa que Estados Unidos detuvo la ayuda a Ucrania después de solicitar a este país que investigara a un servidor del Comité Nacional Demócrata . Mulvaney quitó hierro al asunto y negó que esta solicitud tuviera relación alguna con Joe Biden o su hijo Hunter.
“ Lo hacemos todo el tiempo con nuestra política exterior “, dijo el jefe de gabinete para justificar que el gobierno haya s olicitado a Ucrania algo a cambio (quid pro quo) de la ayuda estadounidense a otros países . Mulvaney se refirió específicamente al pedido de Trump para que su homólogo ucraniano investigara a un servidor del Comité Demócrata Nacional (CDN) .

“¿Me habló (Trump) en el pasado sobre la corrupción relacionada al servidor de CND? Absolutamente. No hay duda de eso. Y por eso fue que frenamos el dinero”, dijo Mulvaney a los periodistas de la Casa Blanca. El jefe del gabinete de la Casa Blanca dijo también que una de las principales preocupaciones de Trump era “ investigar qué fue lo que ocurrió en 2016 “, en referencia a la corrupción en Ucrania.
Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, effectively confirmed the main premise of House Democrats’ impeachment inquiry on Thursday, telling reporters that aid was held back from Ukraine in part to prod the country to investigate Democrats https://t.co/Uep9uueYlf
— The New York Times (@nytimes) October 17, 2019
Mulvaney reconocía con sus palabras que Trump había detenido la ayuda a Ucrania, en parte, para presionar al país a investigar al servidor demócrata . Sin embargo, poco después Mulvaney se retractó de sus palabras y dijo que el corte de la financiación no condicionaba a Ucrania a indagar una supuesta interferencia en las elecciones de 2016 y acusó a la prensa de “malinterpretar” sus palabras para “avanzar en una caza de bruja […] contra el presidente Trump”.
“Déjenme ser claro, no hubo absolutamente ningún quid pro quo entre la ayuda militar ucraniana y cualquier investigación sobre las elecciones de 2016″, aclaró a posteriori. “El presidente nunca me pidió retener nada de dinero hasta que los ucranianos hicieran algo relacionado con el servidor”. Mulvaney insistió en explicar que la única razón por la que detuvieron los fondos de seguridad fue para revisar que otras naciones estaban implicadas en acabar con la corrupción.

Who Is Ron Vara? Trade Adviser Invents an Expert

Texto completo: President Trump's trade adviser frequently cited Ron Vara, a fictional source who was a critic of China, in his writings.
Peter Navarro, a top White House trade adviser, has developed a reputation in Washington as a Rasputin-like China hawk who whispers anti-China musings in President Trump's ear.
This week, Washington learned about the mysterious anti-China voice that has long whispered in Mr. Navarro's ear: Ron Vara.
Ron Vara has appeared as a cryptic voice of economic wisdom more than a dozen times in five of Mr. Navarro's 13 books, dispensing musings like "You've got to be nuts to eat Chinese food" and "Only the Chinese can turn a leather sofa into an acid bath, a baby crib into a lethal weapon and a cellphone battery into heart-piercing shrapnel."
But Ron Vara, it turns out, does not exist. At least not in corporeal form. He is apparently a figment of Mr. Navarro's imagination -- an anagram of Mr. Navarro's surname that the trade adviser created as a Hitchcockian writing device and stuck with as something of an inside joke with himself.
Mr. Navarro's imaginary source surfaced this week when The Chronicle of Higher Education published some of the findings of Tessa Morris-Suzuki, an emeritus professor at Australian National University.
Ms. Morris-Suzuki, concerned about Mr. Navarro's statements on China, started digging into his earlier work. She unearthed about a dozen instances when Mr. Navarro, previously a business school professor at the University of California, Irvine, had invoked Ron Vara. Curious why she could find no record of such a person, she soon discovered he was not real.
"I think it's a very strange thing for an academic to do in books that he is presenting as factual," Ms. Morris-Suzuki said in an email. "It might be different if a writer -- even a university-based one -- were writing something that was obviously lighthearted and comical and in a nonacademic context."
Mr. Navarro holds a doctorate in economics from Harvard University. His interests shifted from utility regulation to investment strategy before he latched on to China, becoming a notorious hawk whose anti-China screeds like his book and documentary film "Death by China" caught the eye of Mr. Trump.
Ron Vara first appeared in Mr. Navarro's 2001 book, "If It's Raining in Brazil, Buy Starbucks." He was described as a gulf war reservist who, like Mr. Navarro, had studied economics at Harvard.
Some of Mr. Navarro's insights in that book are attributed to Ron Vara in later works, Ms. Morris-Suzuki said. For instance, Mr. Navarro advised in his 2001 book, "Don't play checkers in a chess world." That same wisdom is attributed to Ron Vara in "The Well-Timed Strategy" (2006) and "Always a Winner" (2009).
Far from an investing oracle, Ron Vara tended to offer advice in bite-size clichés, such as "Ride the stock market cycle -- or be run over," which appeared in Mr. Navarro's book "When the Market Moves, Will You Be Ready?"
By the time Mr. Navarro's musings turned to China, so did, naturally, those of Ron Vara. In "The Coming China Wars," a section about China's "poisoned food chain" warned about toxic Chinese fish being exported to the United States. A quote from Ron Vara drove the point home: "You've got to be nuts to eat Chinese food."
"Death by China," Mr. Navarro's seminal book, which he wrote with Greg Autry, used a Ron Vara quote to set up a section about how the American eagle had become the world's biggest pigeon: "The Manufacturing Dragon is voracious. The Colonial Dragon is relentless. The American Eagle is asleep at the wheel."
A White House spokesman had no comment on Mr. Navarro's work. A spokesman for the University of California, Irvine, declined to weigh in.
"Mr. Navarro is on leave and no longer represents the university, so we do not have a comment," said Tom Vasich, the university's director of media relations. "We appreciate your interest in U.C.I."
In a statement to The Chronicle, Mr. Navarro likened Ron Vara to "Alfred Hitchcock appearing briefly in cameo in his movies" and said it was "refreshing" that someone finally figured out his joke.
The fact that Ron Vara was fake was lost on those who know Mr. Navarro, including some who collaborated with him on writings that attributed comments to the fake source.
Glenn Hubbard, who co-wrote "Seeds of Destruction" with him, told The New York Times that he had been unaware of the creative license that Mr. Navarro had taken.
Michael Pillsbury, a China scholar at the Hudson Institute who occasionally plays tennis with Mr. Navarro, said he hadn't realized that Mr. Navarro had dabbled in fiction.
"I always knew Peter was creative and imaginative, but I badly misunderestimated him," Mr. Pillsbury said.
Mr. Navarro declined to elaborate further to The Times. He did, however, invoke his alter-ego once more.
"As Ron Vara might say, 'Lighten up and have fun reading the books,"' Mr. Navarro said in a text message.

Adam Schiff Is the Congressman Trump Wants You to Hate

Texto completo: Relentless, yes. But "radical left" and "lowlife"? Not at all.
The paradox of Adam Schiff is this: He is depicted by some Republicans as a fanatical partisan, with President Trump suggesting that he is a "radical left" "lowlife" who should be arrested for treason, yet in real life Schiff is a cerebral and mild-mannered moderate.
But perhaps there's a logic to Trump's venom: Schiff's mild persona conceals a relentless determination. That's why he's a marathoner and a triathlon athlete. It's also how he first received attention, as a dogged young federal prosecutor in Los Angeles who won a conviction -- after two failed trials led by other prosecutors -- against an F.B.I. agent accused of spying for Russia for sex and money.
Now he's again investigating alleged Russia-related wrongdoing by a federal employee, only this time the employee is the president.
Trump and his supporters are trying to "Pelosify" Schiff. Representative Andy Biggs, an Arizona Republican, is calling for a censure of Schiff for pursuing "a witch hunt in a fantasy land."
All this is bizarre. Schiff has not even come out for impeachment, saying that such decisions should await the investigation, although he is blunt about describing Trump as a danger to the country. Schiff was chosen to lead the impeachment inquiry precisely because of his reputation not as a bomb-thrower but as a reasonable lawyer who will oversee a meticulous inquiry.
"If that makes me appear as a partisan, I'm willing to accept that," Schiff told me in a long conversation before an audience at the 92nd Street Y in New York. "The way I view it, my role is to defend our democracy at a time when it is deeply at risk."
Schiff grew up in Massachusetts, Arizona and California. His father was a garment salesman who later owned and operated a lumber yard, and his mother was a real estate agent. At Stanford, Schiff was both pre-med and pre-law but finally decided that law school would be more useful for a political career. His parents, hoping for a doctor, were aghast.
After Harvard Law School, Schiff worked as a prosecutor, dabbled in politics and began writing screenplays -- he's still writing them. In 2000 he defeated Representative James Rogan, a Republican in Los Angeles County who had been deeply involved in the impeachment of Bill Clinton two years earlier. If anybody understands that impeachment can create political vulnerabilities, it's Schiff.
In Congress, Schiff gravitated toward national security issues. He was active in trying to address the genocide in Darfur, identified with the Blue Dog group of moderate Democrats and joined the House Intelligence Committee -- one of those nonglamorous places where hearings are often closed and there are few chances for grandstanding.
On Capitol Hill, Schiff is known as a slightly goofy nerd who recites endless lines from the movie "The Big Lebowski" and gamely tries his hand once a year at stand-up comedy. He's also renowned for his wife's name, Eve; Adam and Eve are teased for their failure to name their kids Cain and Abel.
Charles Glovsky, Schiff's cousin, told me that friends are always advising Schiff to buy nicer suits or less decrepit shoes, but that he isn't interested. "Not motivated by money at all," Glovsky said.
These days, Schiff said, he's trying to proceed as fast as possible with the impeachment investigation, but he resisted my attempts to pin him to a timeline. "When you consider how much we have learned in the last three weeks, it's breathtaking," he said. "It's terrifying."
He said that his committee is investigating whether there is a recording of the call between Trump and Ukraine's president, either in the U.S. or in Ukraine. "We are determined to find out," he said.
Schiff was particularly scathing about Attorney General William Barr. "He's the second most dangerous person in the country," Schiff said. "In his own way, he's as much of a threat to the rule of law as the president."
I asked if the House might, in a bid to compel testimony, exercise its "inherent contempt" authority and send the sergeant-at-arms out to arrest people and lock them up in the Capitol. Schiff said he had ruled this out but was considering fining those who refuse to cooperate.
He acknowledged some missteps, including misleading comments about his committee's contact with the whistle-blower. I argued that we might be better off if hearings were public; he responded that initial hearings need to be closed to keep witnesses from knowing what others have said, but he added that "all these transcripts are going to be made public."
"There are still people with an open mind," he said. "And those are the ones I'm trying to speak to."
The larger issue, he said, is that democracy throughout the world is under threat. "This is bigger than Trump: It started before Trump; it won't end with Trump," he said. "The bigger picture is democracy is hanging in the balance, and we remain its best hope."

Texto completo: NEW YORK - Harold Bloom, the eminent critic and Yale professor whose seminal "The Anxiety of Influence" and melancholy regard for literature's old masters made him a popular author and standard-bearer of Western civilization amid modern trends, died Monday at age 89.
Bloom's wife, Jeanne, said that he had been in failing health, although he continued to write books and was teaching as recently as last week. Yale said Bloom died at a New Haven, Conn., hospital.
Bloom wrote more than 20 books and prided himself on making scholarly topics accessible to the general reader. Although he frequently bemoaned the decline of literary standards, he was as well placed as a contemporary critic could hope to be. He appeared on best-seller lists with such works as "The Western Canon" and "The Book of J," was a guest on "Good Morning America" and other programs and was a National Book Award finalist and a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters. A readers' poll commissioned by the Modern Library ranked "The Western Canon" at No. 58 on a list of the 20th century's best nonfiction English-language books.
His greatest legacy could well outlive his own name: the title of his breakthrough book, "The Anxiety of Influence." Bloom argued that creativity was not a grateful bow to the past, but a Freudian wrestle in which artists denied and distorted their literary ancestors while producing work that revealed an unmistakable debt.
He was referring to poetry in his 1973 publication, but "anxiety of influence" has come to mean how artists of any kind respond to their inspirations. Bloom's theory has been endlessly debated, parodied and challenged, including by Bloom. The book's title has entered the culture in ways Bloom likely never imagined or desired, such as The New York Times headline that read "Jay-Z Confronts the Anxiety of Being Influential" or the Canadian rock band that named itself "Anxiety of Influence."
Bloom openly acknowledged his own heroes, among them Shakespeare, Samuel Johnson and the 19th century critic Walter Pater. He honored no boundaries between the life of the mind and life itself and absorbed the printed word to the point of fashioning himself after a favorite literary character, Shakespeare's betrayed, but life-affirming Falstaff. Bloom's affinity began at age 12, when Falstaff rescued him from "debilitating self-consciousness," and he more than lived up to his hero's oversized aura in person. For decades he ranged about the Yale campus, with untamed hair and an anguished, theatrical voice, given to soliloquies over the present's plight.
News of his death received a mixed response from former Yale students. Some praised his extraordinary erudition and ability to recite verse from memory, while others noted allegations of sexual harassment. In 2004, the author Naomi Wolf wrote that he made unwanted advances while she was attending Yale. Bloom denied the allegations.
The youngest of five children, he was born in 1930 in New York's East Bronx to Orthodox Jewish immigrants from Russia, neither of whom ever learned to read English. Bloom's literary journey began with Yiddish poetry, but he soon discovered the works of Hart Crane, T.S. Eliot, William Blake and other poets. He would allege that as a young man he could absorb 1,000 pages at a time.
"The sense of freedom they conferred," he wrote of his favorite books, "liberated me into a primal exuberance."
He graduated in 1951 from Cornell University, where he studied under the celebrated critic M.H. Abrams, and lived abroad as a Fulbright Scholar at Pembroke College, Cambridge. After earning his doctorate degree from Yale in 1955, he joined the school's English faculty. Bloom married Jeanne Gould in 1958 and had two sons.
In the '50s, he opposed the rigid classicism of Eliot. But over the following decades, Bloom condemned Afrocentrism, feminism, Marxism and other movements he placed in the "School of Resentment." A proud elitist, he disliked the "Harry Potter" books and slam poetry and was angered by Stephen King's receiving an honorary National Book Award. He dismissed as "pure political correctness" the awarding of the Nobel Prize for literature to Doris Lessing, author of the feminist classic "The Golden Notebook."
"I am your true Marxist critic," he once wrote, "following Groucho rather than Karl, and take as my motto Groucho's grand admonition, 'Whatever it is, I'm against it.'"
In "The Western Canon," published in 1994, Bloom named the 26 crucial writers in Western literature, from Dante to Samuel Beckett, and declared Philip Roth, Thomas Pynchon and Don DeLillo among the contemporary greats. Shakespeare reigned at the canon's center, the inventor of our modern, self-conscious selves, a patriarch so mighty that Freud, Tolstoy and other latter-day masters nearly drove themselves mad rejecting him.
"Freud is essentially prosified Shakespeare," Bloom observed.
The "lemmings", as Bloom called them, had their own harsh criticism of Bloom. Observers noted that "The Western Canon" featured a good number of Yale-affiliated poets on its list of important living American authors. He was mocked as out of touch and accused of recycling a small number of themes. "Bloom had an idea; now the idea has him," British critic Christopher Ricks once observed.
Bloom's praises were not reserved for white men. In "The Book of J," released in 1990, Bloom stated that some parts of the Bible were written by a woman. (He often praised the God of the Old Testament as one of the greatest fictional characters). He also admired Virginia Woolf, Jane Austen, George Eliot and Emily Dickinson and the hundreds of critical editions he edited include works on Toni Morrison, Maya Angelou and Amy Tan.
Bloom did write a novel, "The Flight to Lucifer," but was no more effective than most critics attempting fiction and later disowned the book. In "The Anatomy of Influence," a summation released in 2011, Bloom called himself an Epicurean who acknowledged no higher power other than art, living for "moments raised in quality by aesthetic appreciation."
His resistance to popular culture was emphatic, but not absolute. He was fond of the rock group The Band and fascinated by the Rev. Jimmy Swaggart and other televangelists. He even confessed to watching MTV, telling The Paris Review in 1990 that "what is going on there, not just in the lyrics but in its whole ambience, is the real vision of what the country needs and desires. It's the image of reality that it sees, and it's quite weird and wonderful."

A TRAIN TALE; 'DERAILED' TELLS THE STORY OF THE HIGH-SPEED RAIL LINE THAT WASN'T; POLITICS

Texto completo: "Derailed," a new podcast from Wisconsin Public Radio, opens with what most people remember about a plan to build a high-speed-rail line between Madison and Milwaukee: Its swift demise. Shortly after his election to office in 2010, Gov. Scott Walker rejected $810 million in federal funding for the project, stalling a vision to connect Madison, Milwaukee and Chicago with a sophisticated rail network.
But as the hosts of "Derailed" will tell you, there's a lot more to the story than Walker's controversial decision to reject the money.
"I think that when people remember this story, they remember the ending," said Bridgit Bowden, WPR special projects reporter and co-host of the show. "But going all the way back to the beginning has been really interesting."
Bowden, along with fellow co-host and WPR Capitol Bureau chief Shawn Johnson, dive deep into the story of Wisconsin high-speed rail on "Derailed," a limited-run podcast that releases its second episode Wednesday.
The two say they decided to launch the project looking into high-speed rail since, as Bowden puts it in the first episode, it's obvious that the topic still "makes people's blood boil." Across the show's beat-by-beat retelling of the story from how former Gov. Tommy Thompson championed a modernized transit system for the state starting in the 1990s, through Gov. Jim Doyle's push for funding for a Madison-Milwaukee line in 2009, through the emergence of fierce Republican opposition to the plan the two reporters said they wanted to suss out why the project continues to stir up a lot of emotion among Wisconsinites.
"What we found as we reported on it is, it still gets people talking. People still have strong opinions on this," Johnson said. "So we just wanted to explore why."
Bowden said that the decision to make a limited-run, documentary-style podcast had been a long time in the works, in part because of how perfectly the format suited her job, which focuses on in-depth, journalistic reporting. She also noted that the format is growing in popu-larity. Recent limited-run hits from journalistic outlets include "Believed" from NPR, to "Bear Brook" from New Hampshire Public Radio, and "Caliphate" from the New York Times.
For Johnson, the project has also been an opportunity to revisit a story that he had reported on as a Capitol reporter for WPR in 2010.
"It's given me a chance to see what was going on beneath the surface when this was happen-ing," Johnson said.
As the two worked on the story, listening to archival materials and conducting interviews with the likes of former Secretary of Transportation Ray LaHood and Gov. Tommy Thompson, Johnson said he was struck by how much he didn't remember about how high-speed rail became an emergent topic for Wisconsin in 2010. For example, he said he was surprised to find out that Thompson was a passionate advocate for connecting the region with a high-speed rail network.
The pilot episode, called "Tommy's Train," features clips of Thompson delivering speeches on the promise of high-speed rail. At one point, the governor cracks jokes about how easy it would be to watch the Green Bay Packers trounce the Chicago Bears by hopping on a train to Soldier Field.
"It's something that I didn't realize. Tommy Thompson was all in on this train," Johnson said.
Through their interviews with Thompson, the two found out that that passion stemmed from a childhood spent around trains in Elroy, Wisconsin.
"It takes me back to my boyhood," Thompson says on the podcast. "My boyhood of hopping freights just like a hobo."
The two also said they were struck by how the story touches on shifting political dynamics in the state. When Gov. Tommy Thompson touted high-speed rail, he said he didn't get any pushback from GOP colleagues. And even after President Barack Obama carved out the funding for the Madison-Milwaukee line in the 2009 stimulus bill, said Johnson, there wasn't a major pushback against the plan.
The gubernatorial campaign of Scott Walker changed that. The governor, along with conservative radio host Charlie Sykes, railed against the plan as an example of government spending gone too far, and of the unfair privileging of Madison and Milwaukee over the rest of the state.
"This transforms from an issue that Republicans maybe have reservations about, to an issue that they could never support," Johnson said.
Bowden added that it's fascinating to contrast the rhetoric over high-speed rail starting in 2010, to the way it was talked about 20 years ago.
"It's so interesting to me. Tommy Thompson was a big-time Republican. It's interesting to look back just 20 years ago, and we have a prominent Republican governor pushing passenger rail," she said.
In the meanwhile, Johnson and Bowden are still in the thick of their work on the project. Still on their wish list: an interview with Gov. Scott Walker. "That's the one we're still holding out hope for," said Johnson.
Johnson and Bowden said to expect new episodes to publish every Wednesday. The show is available on Apple Podcasts, along with all other major podcast platforms. CREDIT: By Erik Lorenzsonn

Democratic candidates lie about abortion because they can

Texto completo: When it comes to abortion, Democratic candidates are out of touch with America.
They made this much clear at the Democratic debate on Tuesday night. Barring Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, none of the presidential candidates accurately represented either the opposition or even the abortion positions of their own party. The thing is, they get away with it.
California Sen. Kamala Harris made Planned Parenthood happy by bringing up abortion almost first thing, something the abortion provider had been lobbying candidates to do. A moderator asked Harris for her response to Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders’ spiel on healthcare, and instead of tackling “Medicare for all” she pivoted to abortion, delivering one of the first applause lines of the night.
“This is the sixth debate we have had in this presidential cycle and not nearly one word, with all of these discussions about healthcare, on women's access to reproductive healthcare, which is under full-on attack in America today,” she said. Harris insisted that "women will die" without abortion access, neglecting to mention that unborn women will die because of it.
Not to lose out on his own share of feminist clout, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker jumped in, proclaiming that “women should not be the only ones taking up this cause and this fight.” Abortion access is important because "women are people," Booker affirmed, attacking a straw man so flimsy that even the senator polling at 2% imagined he could eke out some prestige by toppling it.
When the moderators brought up abortion later, most candidates were quick to announce that they’d “codify Roe v. Wade.” While she joined other candidates in supporting the affirmation of the Supreme Court decision, Gabbard was the only one of them with a unique, and realistic, perspective.
“This is often one of the most difficult decisions that a woman will ever have to make, and it's unfortunate to see how in this country it has for so long been used as a divisive political weapon,” she said. “I agree with Hillary Clinton on one thing, disagree with her on many others, but when she said abortion should be safe, legal, and rare, I think she's correct.”
"Safe, legal, and rare" hasn't been in vogue since 1996, but Gabbard earned an unlikely ally for her use of the mantra. After Gabbard spoke, former Planned Parenthood President Leana Wen, who was ousted from the organization for not being politically radical enough, tweeted her support for the congresswoman’s rhetoric.
Wen wrote that she appreciates how Gabbard “brought up the third rail for Democrats: that abortion should be ‘safe, legal, and rare.’ We should reduce the need for abortions by investing in prevention.”
That puts Wen on the centrist side of the radical pro-abortion lobby. Echoing the broader party line, one pro-choice activist complained that Wen’s framing was “stigmatizing.” The difference between Wen and Gabbard's perspective and that of the Democratic establishment reveals all you need to know about how Democratic leadership has come to break from its liberal constituency.
Rather than proclaiming #ShoutYourAbortion such as the most vocal activists on Twitter, many Democrats still prefer that abortion become safe, legal, and rare. Just 31% of Democrats believe abortion should be legal in all circumstances, according to a recent NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist Poll.
Harris says anti-abortion legislation is the fault of “state legislators who are outdated and out of touch, mostly men who are telling women what to do with their bodies.”
On abortion, though, it’s not the Republican legislators who are out of touch. It’s the Democratic Party, whose commitment to preserving abortion has followed a leftward lurch which stigmatizes conservatives and alienates the liberals it's supposed to represent.

Texto completo: Beto O’Rourke and Pete Buttigieg took to the morning shows to question fellow 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren’s plan to pay for "Medicare for all."
In Tuesday night’s primary debate, Warren faced several pointed questions about her plan to pay for "Medicare for all," her universal healthcare proposal that carries an estimated cost of $32.6 trillion over a decade.
In a Wednesday interview on Morning Joe, O’Rourke noted that he has promised to not raise the taxes of middle class families earning $250,000 or less annually, but Warren refused to make the same promise.
Tweet
“In my case, universal, guaranteed, high-quality healthcare for every single American without a middle class tax hike. In fact, if your family earns $250,000 or less, you will not see a tax increase in my administration. I can answer that question very clearly,” said O’Rourke. “Senator Warren had a hard time giving our fellow Americans that same assurance. In fact, just could not answer that question point blank.”
Buttigieg, in a CNN interview the same day, filed a similar attack against Warren, joking that she’s given better descriptions of her famed selfie lines than of her tax plan to fund "Medicare for all."

“There’s still been no explanation for a multi-trillion dollar hole in this plan. I have a lot of respect for senator Warren, but last night she was more specific and forthcoming about the number of selfies she’s taken than about how this plan is going to be funded,” said Buttigieg. “And that’s a real problem.”
Warren seemed to be the number one target on the debate stage Tuesday night following several first place appearances in nationwide polls.

Texto completo: Poor Sen. Elizabeth Warren.
Cruel and unfair moderators asked her repeatedly Tuesday evening during a 2020 Democratic primary debate whether she will raise taxes on the middle class to fund her astronomically expensive "Medicare for all" proposal. The moderators even simplified the question for her at one point by asking her to respond with a simple “yes” or “no” answer. Warren dodged the question each time, even prompting her opponents to call her out.
In a normal world, this would be a black eye for the Massachusetts lawmaker. In a normal world, the media would be drawing more attention to Warren’s duplicitous nonanswers. But we don’t live in a normal world. Certain members of our very brave and honest news media have responded instead to the debate question by accusing Tuesday's moderators of being … unfair?
“The ‘make Elizabeth Warren say she would raise taxes on the middle class’ question should be a credibility killer. For the journalists who keep asking it,” complained media critic and New York University journalism professor Jay Rosen.
Rosen, interestingly, had said in 2012 that “everyone knows” that then-GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney’s tax proposal is mathematically impossible and that it is merely a matter of how “we live with the fiction.” Guess the math doesn't matter anymore.
Huffington Post editor-in-chief Lydia Polgreen said elsewhere of the Democratic debate questions for Warren: “‘Will you raise middle-class taxes’ is a lazy, gotcha question based on untested premises. A fairer question would be to ask candidates to explain how they’d convince voters of the tax tradeoff’s benefits.”
Quick question: Do you think "tax tradeoff" will catch on and take the place of "tax increase in America's future vocabulary?
Polgreen added in a follow-up, “You could ask: How will you pay for Medicare For All? You don’t need to frame it in a way that’s ready made for attack ads. Warren’s answer isn’t sufficient, but a better question would put her more firmly on the spot. Like I said, I’m not defending Warren’s answer. I’m saying the question flows from a fundamentally partisan premise.”
So now it's partisan to ask whether a given plan involves raising taxes.
Then there is Washington Post media columnist and former New York Times public editor Margaret Sullivan, who said that the debate could have been “much, much better" had the moderators framed “the (apparently unavoidable) question about universal health care and how to fund it in a non-gotcha way.”
“Journalists are kindly doing President Trump’s work for him when they insist on trying to pin down Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), the new front-runner, to declare she’d raise taxes to fund Medicare-for-all,” Sullivan writes. “Of course, it’s legitimate to dig into the costs, but not in a way that creates a nice GOP campaign ad, and misses the larger lens of overall costs. (Warren, notably, refused to take the bait.)”
"Will you raise taxes?” is one of the most basic questions that can be asked of any public official at any level, municipal, state, or federal. It's not only a legitimate question, it's an important question. Warren was asked and dodged it repeatedly. But rather than ding the candidate who boasts she has a plan for everything for dodging the simplest of campaign questions, certain media critics and news editors have decided instead that the question itself is unfair and unworthy of a response.
This is an almost note-for-note repeat of how certain newsrooms ran defense for Warren last week after questions were raised about her claim that she was fired in the 1970s for being “visibly pregnant." The trick is to attack both the question and the person who poses it as illegitimate.
Mark my words: This will be the media formula for protecting Warren going forward.

Texto completo: To learn who the media love, look at who they let speak.
Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren spent the most time talking at the CNN/New York Times debate on Tuesday night, clocking in at almost 23 minutes, according to tracking by CNN. For a lineup of 12 presidential candidates, that’s pretty good. (Then again, how much did we expect to hear from Tom Steyer?)
Warren’s long-windedness wouldn’t necessarily indicate bias if she hadn’t A) talked for almost seven minutes longer than the next-most-verbose candidate and B) already received such fawning coverage in the press.
Warren has benefited from consistently smooth coverage from the media (and even Hollywood). When a recent report questioned the truth in Warren’s story about getting fired from a teaching job for being pregnant, several outlets ran interference for her, with the Washington Post calling it a “fake GOP scandal” in spite of pretty compelling evidence from two independent sources that she made the whole thing up.
On stage Tuesday night, only her fellow candidates were willing to push Warren, with South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar reprimanding her for refusing to state honestly where she’d get the funds for her universal healthcare plan (hint: they'll come from tax increases).
Joe Biden came in a distant second for time speaking at just 16 minutes. He was forced to defend his son and to claim he is not too old, at almost 77, to run for president.
Once considered the front-runner, Biden now lags behind Warren in some polls, especially at the state level. But that doesn’t mean he’s lost the media favoritism that CNN clearly believes he deserves.
Moderator Anderson Cooper shamelessly took Biden’s side when Cooper claimed that President Trump “falsely” accused Biden’s son, Hunter Biden, of corruption. Never mind that using political clout for personal gain — something Hunter Biden essentially admitted in a recent interview — is exactly that.
Behind Warren and Biden, with a little less media love, were Klobuchar, erstwhile media darling Beto O’Rourke, and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who all tied around 13 minutes, followed by Buttigieg, California Sen. Kamala Harris, and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker.
The moderators of the latest Democratic debate had clearly decided that Warren had already won, and they let her take a victory lap (or two).
Could Warren be the next Hillary Clinton? The press sure hopes so. But look out, because that could run all the way to its full logical conclusion. If she gets the Democratic nomination, her shot at the White House may not be much better.

Cut Waste From Health System

Texto completo: American health care is by far the most expensive in the world. It accounts for about 18 percent of the entire economy and costs more than $10,000 per person every year.
Now, a major study published Oct. 7 in the Journal of the American Medical Association has concluded that between 20% and 25% of that spending is wasteful. In terms of money, that is about $760 billion every year, roughly equal to the cost of the Medicare program, more than the entire U.S. defense budget and comparable to total spending nationwide on public education.
The study, conducted by researchers for the University of Pittsburgh and the health in-surer Humana, analyzed 54 academic studies on health care waste that have been conducted since 2012. They concluded that the single largest source of wasteful health care spending, about $266 billion per year, is in the area of administration - the vast system for billing and reporting among health care providers and public and private health insurers.
Don Berwick, a physician and senior fellow at the Institute for Healthcare Improvement, told The New York Times that much of that administrative waste could be resolved by moving to a single-payer system.
“What stands in the way of reducing waste, especially administrative waste and out-of-control prices, is much more a lack of political will than a lack of ideas about how to do it,” he said.
The second-leading area of wasteful spending is in pricing, the study found, - more than $230 billion a year. That could be resolv-ed through true competition rather than the ongoing wave of consolidated regional health monopolies, or by the sort of health care price controls that governments impose in most other developed countries, or both.

Texto completo: The Glenbard Parent Series: (GPS) Navigating Healthy Families will present Voice Lessons for Parents: What to Say, How to Say it and When to Listen with Wendy Mogel at 7 p.m. Tuesday, Oct. 29, at Glenbard South High School, 23W200 Butterfield Road in Glen Ellyn. This program will be repeated at noon Wednesday, Oct. 30, at Marquardt School District 15 administration center, 1860 Glen Ellyn Road in Glendale Heights.
Parents/caregivers sometimes find they use tone or body language that doesn’t create the desired outcome with their children. When teens are confronted with messages that come across as pleading, annoyed, condescending, wounded, or outraged, that delivery style overpowers the content of the message.
Mogel has developed voice lessons to assist adults in communicating with children at every stage of life. She demonstrates how a shift in tone, tempo and body language can lead to children who respond by cooperating with greater eagerness and communicating with more warmth, respect, and sincerity. Mogel also will highlight the best way to talk about your child when speaking to teachers, coaches, grandparents and others. In addition, she will provide a guide to the art of talking to children distracted by digital devices.
Continuing professional development units are available.
Mogel is a clinical psychologist and the author of several New York Times bestsellers, including "The Blessings of a B Minus," and "The Blessings of a Skinned Knee."

Thomas: Knowing it all at 16

Texto completo: Greta Thunberg has been dubbed by the media as a "climate change activist" and a teen "eco-warrior." She was at the United Nations in New York to appear before diplomats and others at a "climate action summit." Only the UN has less credibility than a teenager.
Thunberg is on a world tour promoting the latest end-of-the-planet scenario. By the way, shouldn't she be in school? Reporters won't ask because most appear to buy into her secular doctrine that the apocalypse is just around the corner.
Thunberg claims "people are dying" because the Earth is getting hotter. She warns that adults had better wake up or they will burn in ecological hell or perhaps even the real thing. Her theological qualifications have yet to be examined.
Think back to when you were 16 and believed you knew it all. At 18, an adult called me "precocious." I had to look up the meaning in a dictionary. It was a humbling experience.
As their adolescent brains continue to develop, most teenagers know only what their teachers and textbooks tell them and maybe their parents, if they still listen to them. Science textbooks mostly embrace the climate change scenario, so why wouldn't kids believe what they read and what they're taught?
Thunberg was preparing to speak to the assembled adults at the UN when President Trump walked in ahead of her. The man knows showmanship. The expression on Thunberg's face was priceless. If spitting fire contributed to "global warming," we'd have been in real trouble.
It appears the girl is being held in intellectual captivity. She might benefit from consulting a list of "50 Years of Failed Eco-pocalytpic Predictions" compiled by the Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI.org), the nonprofit libertarian think tank based in Washington, D.C.
Just a few examples:
In 1967, the Los Angeles Times carried a story headlined "Dire Famine Forecast by 1975." The story said it might "already be too late."
On August 10, 1969, the New York Times quoted a 37-year-old scientist predicting a new ice age and that "everyone will disappear in a cloud of blue steam by 1989."
An April 16, 1970 story in the Boston Globe quoted Dr. Paul R. Erlich of the University of California, Riverside, predicting America will be "subject to water rationing by 1974 and food rationing by 1980." Erlich said the oceans would be as dead as Lake Erie in less than a decade.
On July 9, 1971, the Washington Post, which, like most other media, now claims climate change and a warming planet is "settled science," thought differently then. It quoted Dr. S. I. Rasool of NASA and Columbia University. Rasool predicted a "new ice age." He was described as a "leading atmospheric scientist," so he should be believed, right? He predicted we had only about "50 or 60 years" to save ourselves from freezing to death.
On her way back to Sweden, Ms. Thunberg should take along a copy of the CEI summary. She just may discover that some older people might know more than she does about most things and that those who preceded her in these "Chicken Little" hysterics were as wrong then as she is now.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Former national security adviser John Bolton wanted no part of what he derided as the White House's "drug deal" to pressure Ukraine into investigating Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, a former White House official told congressional investigators on Monday, according to reports of her testimony from The New York Times and NBC News.
Fiona Hill, who served as the National Security Council's senior director for Europe and Russia, spent more than 10 hours fielding questions from three House panels behind closed doors.
Her testimony was part of an impeachment inquiry into allegations President Donald Trump used military aid as leverage to get the Ukrainians to dig into an energy company that included the former vice president's son Hunter on its board. Ukrainian officials have said they uncovered no evidence of wrongdoing on the part of the Bidens.
Hill testified that Bolton told her to inform National Security Council lawyer John Eisenberg of the push for a fresh investigation by acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani and Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, the reports said.
Mulvaney, Giuliani and Sondland also wanted Ukrainian officials to explore the possibility of a Ukrainian role in 2016 election interference.
Hill said Bolton advised her to contact Eisenberg after a July 10 meeting with senior Ukrainian officials in which Sondland brought up the issue of investigations, The Wall Street Journal reported.
Bolton told her he wasn't part of "whatever drug deal Sondland and Mulvaney are cooking up," unnamed sources who witnessed Hill's testimony told the Times. He also reportedly referred to Giuliani as "a hand grenade who's going to blow everybody up."
"I always liked and respected John," Giuliani said of Bolton in response to Hill's testimony, according to NBC News. "I'm very disappointed that his bitterness drives him to attack a friend falsely and in a very personal way. It's really ironic that John Bolton is calling anyone else a hand grenade. When John is described by many as an atomic bomb."
Hill told lawmakers that Giuliani's role circumvented the normal national security processes and procedures for forming foreign policy.
The Times reported that she confronted Sondland about what she considered the rogue foreign policy he was instituting in Ukraine, which is not part of the EU and therefore not under the ambassador to the EU's purview.
Sondland told her that he was in charge of Ukraine. When she asked who had given him authority, he replied that the president had, the Times reported.
Sondland is expected to testify Thursday.

Texto completo: The Pirates are among eight teams that are looking to hire a manager this offseason. While several candidates will be of interest to the Pirates, they also will be intriguing to other organizations.
Oakland Athletics bench control coach Ryan Christenson and quality control coach Mark Kotsay are candidates for the Pirates job, but they also have been in the mix for the San Francisco Giants opening. Sam Fuld is the player information coordinator for Philadelphia Phillies and was reported to be on the list for several teams, including the Pirates.
A recent report has Fuld declining interviews in Pittsburgh along with the Chicago Cubs and the New York Mets.
Christenson and Kotsay are among the top applicants who will be interviewing the Pirates as much as the Pirates will be interviewing them.
In that vein, we've decided to list some pros and cons of each job. Since this isn't a ranking, the list will start with the Pirates and go in alphabetical order for the rest of the teams.
Pirates
Pros: It isn't easy to find positives when looking at a last-place finish in the division and their horrendous swoon after the All-Star break. There is, however, hope.
Josh Bell, Bryan Reynolds, Kevin Newman and Starling Marte make up a nice core at the top of the lineup. Newman proved to be a good leadoff hitter, Reynolds is trustworthy in the 2-hole, and Marte and Bell can drive them in. Adam Frazier and Colin Moran add depth to the lineup. If Gregory Polanco is healthy, it makes the offense even more formidable.
Cons: The starting pitching at times was dreadful. Chris Archer, Joe Musgrove, Trevor Williams, Steven Brault and Mitch Keller showed flashes of success, but it wasn't enough. The loss of Jameson Taillon looms large over 2020. Getting a new pitching coach to replace Ray Searage could help, but the Pirates still could use another arm or two. The problem is the Pirates are consistently in the bottom five in payroll. The A's and Tampa Bay Rays have proven that teams don't have to have a big payroll to make the playoffs. A new manager with a choice between the Pirates and a team with deeper pockets will have to decide if winning with the Pirates' salary structure is a realistic task.
Chicago Cubs
Pros: Theo Epstein is known as one of the best minds in baseball. The Cubs are one of the wealthiest franchises in sports, and they don't mind spending money. Anthony Rizzo is a star, and the Cubs have a lot of talent.
Cons: Better tell your agent to get you some guarantees on the front and back end of the deal. Joe Maddon brought the first World Series win to Wrigley Field in more than 100 years and didn't last five seasons. Expectations are high on the North Side of Chicago. The Cubs also mortgaged a lot of the minor league system and young talent to win that World Series. Closer Aroldis Chapman was a big part of that championship, but the Cubs had to trade budding star Gleybar Torres to get him. Moves such as that have the Cubs lacking young stars.
Kansas City Royals
Pros: General manager Dayton Moore is a great baseball mind and is respected in the game. There are some talented players such as Salvador Perez, Whit Merrifield and Jorge Soler, as well. The team will be under new ownership, which seems to want to spend more money.
Cons: This likely will be the final job to get filled because of the ownership change. The Royals are actively rebuilding and struggled this past season.
Los Angeles Angels
Pros: Mike Trout has a chance to go down as one of the top five to ever step on a baseball diamond. Trout is magnificent and gives a strong foundation to build around. Shohei Ohtani is a unique athlete as a hitter and pitcher. Arte Moreno is an owner who will spend on big-name free agents.
Cons: You always will be second fiddle to the Los Angeles Dodgers. Oh, and you're not really in Los Angeles, you're in Anaheim. And share a division with the Houston Astros and A's.
New York Mets
Pros: Pete Alonso is a monster, and the best thing is he has two more seasons before he's eligible for arbitration. Jacob deGrom likely is going to win another Cy Young Award at some point. Noah Syndergaard is a reliable pitcher, as well. The Mets showed lots of promise in 2019 and could be a few pieces away from being a serious contender.
Cons: Like the Angels aren't the Dodgers, the Mets aren't the Yankees. They have had many instances where it seemed as if they were ready to turn the corner, but somehow they fall down. What will be different this time?
Philadelphia Phillies
Pros: They will spend the money. The owners said they were going to break the bank, and they did it. Philadelphia is a significant market, and the owners act like it. Bryce Harper is a good player and there is a lot of talent in that clubhouse.
Cons: Start out winning fast or Philadelphia won't be fun. It is as rough of a market as there is in America. Expectations will be high, and that can be hard to handle for some.
San Diego Padres
Pros: Manny Machado is still a great player in spite of a season that didn't live up to his lofty expectations. Fernando Tatis Jr. is an exciting talent who had one of the best rookie seasons in baseball. The Padres have one of the best closers in baseball with Kirby Yates.
Cons: The offense was 28th in baseball. They struggled with baserunning and situational hitting. The starting pitching needs help, as well.
San Francisco Giants
Pros: The Giants spent most of the 2000s competing for titles, and ownership has proven it will spend big bucks.
Cons: It might be time for a rebuild. The roster is aging other than a few guys such as Mike Yastrzemski. The team is paying the cost for trading away young talent.

Texto completo: This article is part of our continuing Fast Forward series , which examines technological, economic, social and cultural shifts that happen as businesses evolve.
SAN FRANCISCO -- Last week, on the third floor of a small building in San Francisco's Mission District, a woman scrambled the tiles of a Rubik's Cube and placed it in the palm of a robotic hand.
The hand began to move, gingerly spinning the tiles with its thumb and four long fingers. Each movement was small, slow and unsteady. But soon, the colors started to align. Four minutes later, with one more twist, it unscrambled the last few tiles, and a cheer went up from a long line of researchers watching nearby.
The researchers worked for a prominent artificial intelligence lab, OpenAI, and they had spent several months training their robotic hand for this task.
Though it could be dismissed as an attention-grabbing stunt, the feat was another step forward for robotics research. Many researchers believe it was an indication that they could train machines to perform far more complex tasks. That could lead to robots that can reliably sort through packages in a warehouse or to cars that can make decisions on their own.
"Solving a Rubik's Cube is not very useful, but it shows how far we can push these techniques," said Peter Welinder, one of the researchers who worked on the project. "We see this as a path to robots that can handle a wide variety of tasks."
The project was also a way for OpenAI to promote itself as it seeks to attract the money and the talent needed to push this sort of research forward. The techniques under development at labs like OpenAI are enormously expensive -- both in equipment and personnel -- and for that reason, eye-catching demonstrations have become a staple of serious A.I. research.
The trick is separating the flash of the demo from the technological progress -- and understanding the limitations of that technology. Though OpenAI's hand can solve the puzzle in as little as four minutes, it drops the cube eight times out of 10, the researchers said.
"This is an interesting and positive step forward, but it is really important not to exaggerate it," said Ken Goldberg, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, who explores similar techniques.
A robot that can solve a Rubik's Cube is not new. Researchers previously designed machines specifically for the task -- devices that look nothing like a hand -- and they can solve the puzzle in less than a second. But building devices that work like a human hand is a painstaking process in which engineers spend months laying down rules that define each tiny movement.
The OpenAI project was an achievement of sorts because its researchers did not program each movement into their robotic hand. That might take decades, if not centuries, considering the complexity of a mechanical device with a thumb and four fingers. The lab's researchers built a computer system that learned to solve the Rubik's Cube largely on its own.
"What is exciting about this work is that the system learns," said Jeff Clune, a robotics professor at the University of Wyoming. "It doesn't memorize one way to solve the problem. It learns."
Development began with a simulation of both the hand and the cube -- a digital recreation of the hardware on the third floor of OpenAI's San Francisco headquarters. Inside the simulation, the hand learned to solve the puzzle through extreme trial and error. It spent the equivalent of 10,000 years spinning the tiles up, down, left and right, completing the task over and over again.
The researchers randomly changed the simulation in small but distinct ways. They changed the size of the hand and the color of the tiles and the amount of friction between the tiles. After the training, the hand learned to deal with the unexpected.
When the researchers transferred this computer learning to the physical hand, it could solve the puzzle on its own. Thanks to the randomness introduced in simulation, it could even solve the puzzle when wearing a rubber glove or with two fingers tied together.
At OpenAI and similar labs at Google, the University of Washington and Berkeley, many researchers believe this kind of "machine learning" will help robots master tasks they cannot master today and deal with the randomness of the physical world. Right now, robots cannot reliably sort through a bin of random items moving through a warehouse.
The hope is that will soon be possible. But getting there is expensive.
That is why OpenAI, led by the Silicon Valley start-up guru Sam Altman, recently signed a billion-dollar deal with Microsoft. And it's why the lab wanted the world to see a demo of its robotic hand solving a Rubik's Cube. On Tuesday, the lab released a 50-page research paper describing the science of the project. It also distributed a news release to news outlets across the globe.
"In order to keep their operation going, this is what they have to do," said Zachary Lipton, a professor in the machine learning group at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. "It is their life blood."
When The New York Times was shown an early version of the news release, we asked to see the hand in action. On the first attempt, the hand dropped the cube after a few minutes of twisting and turning. A researcher placed the cube back into its palm. On the next attempt, it completed the puzzle without a hitch.
Many academics, including Dr. Lipton, bemoaned the way that artificial intelligence is hyped through news releases and showy demonstrations. But that is not something that will change anytime soon.
"These are serious technologies that people need to think about," Dr. Lipton said. "But it is difficult for the public to understand what is happening and what they should be concerned about and what will actually affect them."

Recalling Dad’s take on impeachment: ‘It is not festive’

Texto completo: Charles M. Blow’s commentary in the New York Times (“It Has Begun”) regarding the impeachment inquiry of the U.S. president had me thinking back to this:
My dad detested liars. He’d give people a pass for some other bad behaviors — “Ok,” he’d say. “Even smart people can do dumb things.” But liars? No way.
Like the time a girl invited me to her school’s big dance, and I stood her up, because I wimped out when I learned some boys on their football team got wind that I’d be there and had planned to do stuff to me. After the girl’s irate mother called him, I told a desperate and transparent lie about what happened. I got my comeuppance, just short of corporal punishment but an agonizingly long lecture starting with “You’re lying” and ending with, “You lied.” That was followed by the added humiliation of him driving me to the girl’s house and waiting in the driveway while I apologized.
To him, a lying son was just slightly worse than the guy who cheated on his taxes or wife, doctored his final golf score and a lying politician.
Enter Richard Nixon.
Dad disliked Nixon for a lot of things. But mostly he saw him as JFK’s Lex Luther, Iago, Goldfinger and Professor Moriarty rolled up into one nasty, formidable foe. JFK, in Dad’s mind, was the only human being, alive and gone, who did no wrong – ever.
All through the summer of the televised Watergate hearings Dad sat transfixed two feet from the TV. When Mom set up his TV tray and brought his breakfasts, lunches and dinners, he’d tell her as events unfolded, “Sylvia, he’s lying. You’ll see.” More concerned about his blood pressure than politics, she’d say, “I’m sure you’re right. Now take your pill. And eat.”
And then came the smoking gun.
Shortly thereafter, when Nixon resigned his presidency to avoid imminent impeachment, I thought Dad would leap from his lounge chair, shout a stream of “I told you so’s” at the TV then take his wife to dinner to celebrate.
But he didn’t.
I thought about that while reading Blow’s thoughts about the events unfolding now. Particularly this:
“It is not a thing to be celebrated. It is a thing to be soberly considered. It is a sign that the character and behavior of the target — in this case the president — is being searched for deficiency … and the American electorate has been betrayed.
“This is a funeral; it is not festive.”

Texto completo: The fourth Democratic presidential debate, with 12 candidates on stage, will take place at 7 p.m. Tuesday at Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio, and will be broadcast on CNN. The New York Times is also hosting the debate. Here are four things to look for:
1 Warren rising: U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts has pulled even with former Vice President Joe Biden in national polls and is edging him in polls in Iowa and New Hampshire, the first nominating states. How will she wear the look of a winner?
2 Biden’s impeachment (bad) bounce: Biden is in the thick of impeachment politics as the target of President Donald Trump’s entreaties to the Ukrainian president. Will his rivals rally behind him or hint that the party would be better served with a fresher candidate?
3 Good old Bernie: Bernie Sanders suffered a heart attack earlier this month, promising to scale back a bit on his frenetic pace. Will health concerns hover over his every curmudge only utterance?
4 Fighting to stay on stage: Texans Beto O’Rourke and Julián Castro generated headlines in the September debate but their poll numbers didn’t budge. They both must use Tuesday’s debate to catapult them to the November debate stage in Atlanta.

Texto completo: Presidential hopefuls Beto O'Rourke and Pete Buttigieg tussled over the Texas Democrat's plan to confiscate military-style weapons during Tuesday night's debate.
O'Rourke shifted the focus of his campaign to emphasize gun control and gun violence following the August shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio. His call for a gun confiscation plan received condemnation from both sides of the political aisle.
During the debate, CNN's Anderson Cooper asked O'Rourke how he planned to obtain weapons from gun owners who refuse to give them up.
"If someone does not turn in an AR-15 or an AK-47, one of these weapons of war, or brings it out in public and brandishes it in an attempt to intimidate as we saw — we were at Kent State recently — then that weapon will be taken from them," O'Rourke stated. "If they persist, there will be other consequences from law enforcement. But the expectation is that Americans will follow the law. I believe in this country, I believe in my fellow Americans. I believe that they will do the right thing."
Buttigieg blasts O’Rourke: ‘I don’t need lessons from you on courage, political or personal’
Cooper then asked Buttigieg his thoughts because he has labeled O'Rourke's plan as "confiscation."
He responded, "Congressman, you just made it clear that you don’t know how this is actually going to take weapons off the streets. If you can develop the plan further, I think we can have a debate about it. But we can’t wait. People are dying in the streets right now."
"We cannot wait for purity tests. We have to just get something done," the South Bend, Indiana, mayor added.
The former Texas congressman countered, "This is not a purity test. This is a country that loses 40,000 of our fellow Americans every year to gun violence. This is a crisis. And we’ve got to do something about it. And those challenges that you described are not mutually exclusive to the challenges that I’m describing."
Buttigieg responded, "The problem isn't the polls; the problems is the policy. And I don’t need lessons from you on courage, political or personal."

Amy Klobuchar drops her 'Minnesota nice' act

Texto completo: WESTERVILLE, Ohio — Amy Klobuchar prides herself on being "Minnesota nice," but the senator dropped any sweetness during Tuesday's Democratic presidential debate, taking pointed jabs at primary competitor Elizabeth Warren.
"At least Bernie's being honest here and saying how he's going to pay for this and that taxes are going to go up," Klobuchar said when her Massachusetts Senate colleague repeatedly declined to say whether middle-class Americans would face higher taxes under a "Medicare for all" single-player healthcare plan. "The difference between a plan and a pipe dream is something that you can actually get done."
Klobuchar, who promotes a relatively moderate platform, tore into progressive Warren for suggesting that her signature ultra-rich wealth tax was an expression of better values than the tax plans of her rivals.
"I want to give a reality check here to Elizabeth because no one on this stage wants to protect billionaires. Not even the billionaire wants to protect billionaires," Klobuchar said, referring to hedge fund manager and 2020 contender Tom Steyer. "You know, I think simply because you have different ideas doesn't mean you're fighting for regular people."
Aaron Kall, debate coach at the University of Michigan, suggested that Klobuchar's attacks could be a hail-mary attempt to gain traction.
"She struck me as a candidate that kind of knows the end may be near," Kall told the Washington Examiner. "I thought that she had a strong performance but is so far back from the pack that given the time kind of remaining, I don't think it'll be enough. It's a little bit too much too late."
Klobuchar has not qualified for the November debate round due to a failure to meet the Democratic National Committee's polling threshold.
Kall noted that Klobuchar softened her tough exterior during the last question of the debate about an unlikely friendship, which he said seemed "a little bit inconsistent." The Minnesota senator talked about her friendship with the late Republican Sen. John McCain and congressional trips she took with him.

'We are all God's children': Democratic candidates take on Ellen DeGeneres friendship with Bush

Texto completo: One of the final segments of the Tuesday debate in Ohio covered the recent controversy swirling around the friendship between comedian Ellen DeGeneres and former President George W. Bush.
DeGeneres made headlines last week after a video surfaced of her and wife Portia de Rossi being friendly with Bush at a Dallas Cowboys game. After receiving backlash on social media about her friendship with the Republican president, DeGeneres asserted on her popular talk show that not all of her friends agree with her politically and stressed the importance of getting along with people from all walks of life.
Using the incident to ask the 12-candidate Democratic field on stage how they intended to get along with those who espouse different values, each expressed how they would reach across the aisle.
"I believe that we should be more kind to other folks," former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro said. "I also believe that we should hold people to account for what they've done, especially public servants who have a record of having done something or not done something."
"We are all God's children," Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard said. "So I've developed friendships that some people may be surprised about ... like [former South Carolina Rep.] Trey Gowdy, for example. He and I disagree a lot and very strongly on a lot of political issues ... The challenge before us today is that our country is very divided. Donald Trump must be defeated."
As debate moderator Anderson Cooper continued to ask which friends each candidate had from the other side of the political aisle, each contender named people with differing views with whom they were able to get along. Several candidates, including Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar and former Vice President Joe Biden named the late Republican Sen. John McCain as a close friend.

Texto completo: Doce de los candidatos demócratas que se enfrentan para postularse como rival de Donald Trump en las elecciones presidenciales de 2020 se enfrentan hoy en un debate celebrado en la Universidad de Otterbein, en Ohio.
El debate presidencial de los demócratas este lunes está organizado por la cadena CNN y el diario The New York Times y puede ser el último de cuatro de los candidatos. La cifra de candidatos es récord para un debate de este tipo . En el siguiente debate, el de noviembre, hasta cuatro de ellos podrán perder su oportunidad de enfrentarse en público a sus competidores.
Julián Castro, el único representante latino, es uno de ellos. A él se unen la representante hawaiana Tulsi Gabbard, la senadora de Minnesota Amy Klobuchar y el exrepresentante demócrata Beto O’Rourke. Si estos cuatro candidatos no se esfuerzan al máximo esta noche, probablemente no participen en el próximo debate.
Esta es la primera vez que se celebra un debate después de que se iniciaran las investigaciones que pueden acabar en un juicio político al presidente Donald Trump. De hecho, el tema del impeachment ha sido el primero por el que han preguntado a los candidatos.
Por otro lado, también la primera vez que Joe Biden sube a un escenario de debate sin ser el claro favorito para las primarias demócratas ya que ahora se los disputa con la senadora de Massachusetts, Elizabeth Warren. Otra de las primicias de este debate es que el senador vuelve a la campaña después de sufrir un ataque cardíaco.

Noem 'strongly condemns' fake video of Trump firing at media, his opponents

Texto completo: Gov. Kristi Noem said she "strongly condemns" a violent video depicting President Donald Trump carrying out a massacre of news organizations and political opponents. The video has been thrust into the national spotlight after it was shown at a national conference over the weekend.
Noem was "briefly" in attendance for part of the American Priority conference, but didn't have any speaking roles at the conference and did not see the "horrible video" when it was shown at the conference, her spokeswoman Kristin Wileman said. Noem has since watched the video and "strongly condemns the despicable message of violence and division it portrays," according to Wileman.
The New York Times reported that the fake video was played at the conference hosted by the pro-Trump group at his Miami resort over the weekend. It includes the logo for Trump's 2020 reelection campaign. The video is an edited scene from the film "Kingsman: The Secret Service" showing Trump, his face superimposed on Colin Firth's character, entering a "Church of Fake News" and opening fire on members of the churchgoers, who have various news organizations' logos or the faces of Democratic lawmakers and other critics superimposed onto their bodies.
Alex Phillips, the American Priority conference organizer, denounced it as an "unauthorized" video that was shown in a side room at the conference and wasn't approved, seen or sanctioned by organizers. Phillips also said in his statement that it was "shocking" the Times didn't report on other events at the conference, including "our panel conversation LITERALLY condemning political violence while claiming to be upset over a meme that was not sanctioned, shown on stage, or approved."
The White House said Trump hasn't seen the video, but he condemns the contents being reported.
USA TODAY contributed to this report.

Texto completo: "The Resident," 9 p.m., Fox. At first glance, this is a Halloween episode — vampires ... and rising from the dead ... and a creepy town, filled with angry stares. Stick around, though; there's a medical basis for each story. The two hospital ones are heavy-handed, despite terrific work from Jonathan Lipnici (the former child star) in the "vampire" tale. But the third — Mina and The Raptor, stranded in creepyville — is beautifully written and filmed, with an important story at its core.
Presidential debate, 8 p.m., CNN. It will be a crowded stage — all 10 people from the previous debate, plus Tulsi Gabbard and Tom Steyer. There should be a lot to talk about; CNN's Erin Burnett and Anderson Cooper will anchor with the New York Times' Marc Lacey.
"The Conners," 8 p.m., ABC. It's been fun to see the always-excellent Johnny Galecki here as David. Now, however, Darlene is close to deciding between David and Ben. Also, her sister Becky, desperate for money, considers a bartending job — a tough duty for an alcoholic.
"Arrow" season-opener, 9 p.m., CW. Of all the shows this fall on the five big commercial broadcast networks – 82 of them – this is the last to arrive. It's also an important one for CW, which now has its six-show "Arrowverse." The eighth and final season — only 10 episodes — starts with Oliver returning, trying to figure The Monitor's mission. Also, the Mia and William team collides with a new foe.
"Treadstone" debut, 10 p.m., USA. The first 11 minutes are as dark and brutal as anything on TV; the rest doesn't get much brighter. We're visiting the early days of the program that molded Jason Bourne and other super-assassins. Leaping between Russia, Germany, North Korea, Alaska, London and more, high-octane scenes are often nasty, sometimes perplexing and usually involving.

Texto completo: Fourth Democratic presidential debate to feature 12 candidates
The fourth Democratic presidential debate will be held at Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio, on Tuesday at 8 p. m. EDT. All 10 Democratic candidates who debated in last month's event in Houston have qualified again, with the addition of two new faces: Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii and billionaire businessman Tom Steyer. The debate is expected to mark the return to the campaign trail for Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who suffered a heart attack this month. Meanwhile, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, arrives amid a string of polls that shows her support surging with likely Democratic primary voters. But the biggest storyline of the debate could revolve around how the candidates talk about the fast-moving impeachment inquiry of President Donald Trump. CNN's Anderson Cooper and Erin Burnett and the New York Times' Marc Lacey will act as debate moderators and it will air on CNN, CNN. com and NYTimes. com.

Impeachment inquiry: Subpoena deadlines upon Giuliani, Pence
In the latest news regarding the impeachment investigation, President Donald Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani's deadline to submit subpoenaed documents is Tuesday, as is Vice President Mike Pence's. Giuliani hasn't said whether he will comply with the subpoena, and Pence may not comply. Tuesday is also the deadline for subpoenas to the Pentagon and the White House Office of Management and Budget for documents detailing why military aid to Ukraine was frozen. Despite the White House proclamation against cooperating, Defense Secretary Mark Esper has said he will comply with the subpoena. On Monday, Fiona Hill, who had been the National Security Council's senior director for Europe and Russia, spent more than 10 hours fielding questions from lawmakers on three committees investigating Trump's dealings with Ukraine: Foreign Affairs, Intelligence, and Oversight and Reform. She did not make any comments or answer questions from reporters after she was finished.

Federal tax extension deadline is here
If you’re one of the roughly 15 million taxpayers who asked the Internal Revenue Service for an extension on filing your federal taxes in April, time's almost up. The federal tax extension deadline hits Tuesday, and if you miss the October deadline, you’re likely to face a hefty penalty for failing to file. Taxpayers who owe the IRS should have sent in an estimated payment before the regular tax deadline in the spring. If they didn't – or low-balled what they owe the taxman – they could be on the hook for an underpayment penalty. If you can’t pay what you owe right away, the IRS will work out a payment plan. The IRS may also waive penalties in certain cases, such as taxpayers who have suffered through a natural disaster. There’s also relief through the agency's "first-time penalty abatement" program.

Cuba Gooding Jr. faces arraignment in groping case
The groping case against actor Cuba Gooding Jr. entered a new phase of confusion Monday, with conflicting claims over how many women have accused him and even what time his arraignment is scheduled for on Tuesday. Gooding, 51, who was charged in June with grabbing the breast of a woman at a New York City bar, is scheduled to be arraigned again after he was indicted last week on the original charge, plus a new and separate misdemeanor sex crime involving a different accuser. Neither of the accusers have been identified by name yet. Details of the second accuser's allegation have not been revealed either, but the indictment is scheduled to be unsealed Tuesday. Mark Heller, one of Gooding's defense lawyers, said the actor intends to plead not guilty and to seek two separate trials on the two accusations. Gooding's case is the second celebrity criminal case scheduled to be tried in New York in the post-#MeToo era. It's also a rare example of prosecuting a groping case, a crime seldom reported in New York.
The video: Does it show Cuba Gooding Jr. groping accuser?
Lawyers seek dismissal: Gooding Jr. 's lawyer seeks dismissal of charge, says accuser has 'troubled mentality'
Original accusations: Gooding Jr. investigated by NY cops for allegedly groping woman in bar
Farrow's book detailing Weinstein reporting, experience with NBC on sale
Ronan Farrow, the journalist whose investigation into Harvey Weinstein's alleged sexual abuse for The New Yorker earned him a Pulitzer Prize last year, shares his account of reporting on the movie mogul in his new book, "Catch and Kill," which is set to be released Tuesday. Part-memoir, "Catch and Kill" details Farrow's months-long struggle to report the Weinstein story for NBC, where he started as host of MSNBC's "Ronan Farrow Daily" in 2014, before becoming an investigative correspondent for "Today. " Details leaked early from the book are staggering, including new information about Matt Lauer's 2017 firing from NBC and an accusation of rape against the former "Today" host. Lauer has since denied the allegations.
'An axe to grind': NBC News chief rejections Farrow's allegations
Speaking out: One victim says Lauer is victim-blaming; a second calls his words 'triggering'
'Extradition is 90% politics and only 10% law': It's not likely Lauer would be prosecuted for alleged 2014 rape in Russia

Purple &amp; Bold: China, the NBA and the limits of basketball diplomacy

Texto completo: Editor’s note: This is the Monday, Oct. 14 edition of the Purple & Bold Lakers newsletter. To receive breaking Lakers news and the newsletter in your inbox, sign up here.
The NBA has a program called Basketball Without Borders, a community service initiative that has run camps in 27 different countries over the last two decades. The dream goes something like this: Through the game of basketball, diverse cultures can find some common ground.
But the world as we know it has borders — not just geopolitical lines on a map, but borders of ideology and values. And never have the limits of NBA diplomacy become more apparent than last week.
The Lakers and Nets unwittingly put themselves in the midst of an international incident this week because of a tweet. It’s a weird situation, especially given that the Chinese response has felt particularly outsized, but it’s highlighted what the limitations are for a game to be a unifying force in a world with endlessly complex divisions.
The NBA became so aware of the thorny nature of the politics of the situation that they shut down media availability for the entire trip. The Athletic reported that players, most prominently LeBron James, were wary of the onus for the NBA’s response to China’s actions being put on them, and asked to not be made available for questions. Rather than putting players in position to say something harmful either abroad or at home (like James Harden awkwardly apologizing to China for his general manager’s tweet), the NBA and the player’s association wanted avoid commentary “in real time,” at least until everyone was safely home.
It should be noted here that China is a country that tightly controls and restricts visas: Journalists, for example, require multiple references to just get in. Multiple times, the government kept the NBA in the dark as to whether they would even be allowed to participate in their events. A situation where the Chinese government harassed or detained a player for something they said while visiting abroad could have felt like a very real threat to the traveling contingent. If that’s the case, Adam Silver probably made a wise choice to keep them out of the line of fire.
But now that everyone is safely home, where does it go from here? The NBA would probably prefer this situation quietly goes away, and that they can continue their lucrative contracts in a country where basketball has been increasingly popular. The New York Times reported last week that the Chinese government was toning down rhetoric against the NBA — which make sense because the incident has drawn attention to their authoritarian handling of the Hong Kong protests. It’s bad diplomacy to cut off a league that’s well-liked in the country, disappointing fans locally and making observers abroad question whether they should do business there.
But it seems difficult to imagine this will go away soon. Next year, the NBA will be pressed to continue exhibition games in China: Which teams are going to want to go? Which teams are going to want their players subjected to questions about what it’s like to be the first teams to play since the international incident that briefly flared up tensions between the NBA and China? What do they think of how China handles Hong Kong (because in a year, a lack of knowledge on the situation will be a less convincing case)?
In absence of the voices of players and other NBA personnel who actually went to China, Steve Kerr’s voice stood out among people stateside who spoke on the issue. Well, “spoke” might be a strong word, but Kerr offered that it’s easier for NBA players and coaches to speak on social issues that are close to home. That’s understandable, and it does seem like an unfair burden to expect the NBA to set the example for all US-Chinese relations in all cases.
But it’s also true that the NBA’s reputation as a league that’s outspoken and unafraid to speak the truth on important issues is taking some hits.
As Kerr put it: “Using the game as a force for the greater good. I think those things are important, those values are important. Obviously, there are tremendous financial forces at play here — so how you reconcile all that, I don’t know.”
No one else in the NBA appears to know either.
In the interest of examining the issue, I’m dropping a lot of related reading down in the links.
BUT WHY TONIGHT?
If you’re surprised to see a Lakers-Warriors home game less than 72 hours after the Lakers last played in China, it’s hard to imagine that the Lakers are thrilled about it either.
It’s unclear if players will miss the game due to fatigue. It’s easy to imagine LeBron James, for example, sitting this one out, especially if Anthony Davis is unable to play following his MRI on his sprained thumb. Preseason games, it should be noted, are firmly under control of teams. But it’s also true that any team going to China is hard-pressed to squeeze six preseason games into its schedule.
Frank Vogel said earlier this month that he would be judicious when it came to divvying up time for the long preseason schedule: “I think they made a wise decision a couple years back to reduce it from 8 preseason games to six. Potentially could go even further down to four. I think each coach has an obligation to their team to make sure they’re being smart with their vets. Make sure they’re getting enough reps to learn their new teammates and the system. Get sharp, ready to play, but not overdo it.”

Dem debate: Tulsi Gabbard will attend after considering protest

Resumen: Tulsi Gabbard said last week she was considering a boycott because she thinks the DNC and media are trying to "hijack the election."

Texto completo: Democratic presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard on Monday said she plans to attend the October debate after she considered boycotting what she claimed was "a serious threat to our democracy" by the Democratic National Committee and the media.
The Hawaii representative said last week, without evidence, that the DNC and corporate media were trying to "hijack the election. " She said she might sit out of Tuesday night's debate.
In the past, Gabbard has criticized the DNC for its debate qualification criteria, including the fact that it only recognizes certain pollsters as counting toward the minimum polling threshold. Gabbard, who did not qualify for the September debate, said other reputable pollsters are left out.
More: What you need to know about the 4th Democratic debate
For October, candidates needed to reach 2% in at least four recognized polls and receive donations from at least 130,000 individuals. Twelve candidates qualified to take the stage.
According to RealClearPolitics' aggregated data, Gabbard is at an average of 0. 7% in polls.
I am seriously considering boycotting October 15 debate to bring attention to DNC/corporate media’s effort to rig 2020 primary. Not against Bernie this time, but against voters in early states Iowa, New Hampshire, South… --> https://t. co/x5P3GFGbyn pic. twitter. com/UgKCj6DGI0
— Tulsi Gabbard (@TulsiGabbard) October 10, 2019
Gabbard also hit back at a New York Times profile of her, which details support from alt-right figures. The Times is a co-host of Tuesday's debate along with CNN.
"As if to prove my point, NYT just published a 'greatest hits' smear piece. All your favorite hits in one article! These are the folks who will be acting as the 'neutral' questioners/moderators of Tuesday’s debate lol," she said on Twitter.
More: The DNC again raises the requirements needed to qualify for the November debates
2020 candidate and author Marianne Williamson expressed support for Gabbard's stance, saying "I have great respect for Tulsi for saying such inconvenient truth. She is absolutely correct. "

Texto completo: Over the last decade, Carlsbad Village has undergone a gradual gentrification, but little pockets of its former, funky self remain.
But one of the village's most unique gathering spots, the alleyway arts hub known as Lhooq Books, may soon disappear.
After 12 years operating a rare and vintage book sales business on Carlsbad Village Drive, fourth-generation Carlsbad native Sean Christopher was unexpectedly served with a 60-day eviction notice last month.

Without a reprieve from his landlord, Christopher has until mid-November to vacate the property, which is both a stand-alone business and an adjoining home, where the single father has lived for the last decade with his 10-year-old son, Jack.
Christopher, 45, said he has always paid his rent on time and over the years has invested thousands of dollars and hundreds of hours of sweat equity fixing up the once-derelict properties, so the eviction came as a shock.
His landlord, San Juan Capistrano City Manager Ben Siegel, declined to comment on why the eviction was served or what plans he has for the property, saying only in an email: "Unfortunately, I cannot comment on the matter due to pending litigation."
Christopher said he knows Siegel has the right to terminate the lease on the 1941 home and shop, but he wants more time to sell or move his inventory and find a new home and a retail space for the business, which makes just enough to cover his bills.
"I'm trying to protect my livelihood and my son's emotional security," Christopher said. "I'm just asking for mediation where we can sit down and I can get a reasonable deal. I need time to relocate or do a massive sale so I can get out by the skin of my teeth at the very least."
Lhooq Books -- located in an alley between Garden State Bagels and a Taco Bell/KFC restaurant near Madison Street -- has the oddball, grass-roots vibe of something you'd find in San Francisco or Berkeley.
The front outdoor wall of the converted garage is lined with hundreds of books that community members are welcome to borrow or pay what they can to buy. Inside, thousands of rare, vintage and new books line floor-to-ceiling shelves decorated here and there with found art, globes, statues, antique typewriters, a fish tank and chess sets.
There are shelves devoted to literature, beat poetry, philosophy, religion, war, fiction, biographies and books by Ayn Rand, Henry Miller, Fyodor Dostoevsky, John Steinbeck and even Stephen King, among many others.
"There's no filler. Everything in here matters. They're either classics or they came highly recommended," Christopher said. "My goal is to help people understand what they're reading. I don't just carry Oscar Wilde. I carry the books that Oscar Wilde was reading when he became who he was."
On the fenced patio, there are tables and chairs where visitors can order a cappuccino and watch movies or attend book readings, lectures, concerts, dance performances and writing workshops. The center's alley-facing west wall is decorated with a colorful mural by skater-artist Kris Markovich.
The hidden-gem quality of Lhooq Books -- which Christopher named after "L.H.O.O.Q.," a tongue-in-cheek 1919 artwork by Marcel Duchamp -- has made it a darling with travel writers and bloggers. It's been written about in the New York Times, the Hidden San Diego website and a local arts crawl guide.
Because Lhooq Books is a part of Carlsbad that's rapidly disappearing, longtime resident Jaimie Muehlhausen has pitched in to help Christopher try to rescue the property.
Back in the 1990s, Muehlhausen was in a band that used the old garage as a place to practice. The building and adjoining house were in derelict condition and the neighborhood was known as unsafe. The band moved out when someone used an ax to break down the wall and steal its instruments.
When Christopher arrived, he cleaned up the area and invited the community in, said Muehlhausen, a veteran designer, musician and longtime collaborator of famed skater Tony Hawk.
"Here's somebody trying to do something good in the community for kids who can't afford new books and young people who want to discover something they've never seen before," Muehlhausen said. "Sure, he's there to make a little money, but that's secondary to what the vibe of the place is as a community spot where people can gather with like-minded individuals and build a community."
Muehlhausen helped Christopher set up a GoFundMe account,which Christopher plans to use to cover attorney fees to fight the eviction. As of Sunday, the fundraiser has collected more than $2,200 of its $5,000 goal.
Growing up in Carlsbad, Christopher was better known in his mid-teens as a professional skateboarder. But when he found a greater passion in learning and books, he ceremonially burned his skating gear and moved to Europe at age 18 for three years of exploration.
After two more years traveling the U.S., he moved to San Francisco to work as a writer and study English literature and history at San Francisco State University. His goal was to become a college professor, but his life took a different turn.
In 2005, he ended up back in Carlsbad working for a professor friend at his failing San Diego bookstore. When the store closed, Christopher was given its inventory and he leased the garage, which had previously been used as a paint store, a newspaper distribution center and a restaurant supply storage space.
With the blessing of the property's owner, now-retired investor Gene Siegel (Ben Siegel's father), Christopher shored up the leaning building, repaired the roof and put in a new wood floor, bookshelves and French doors. Later, he fenced off the patio to connect it to the adjoining 1941 house that he rented in 2009 as a home for himself and his then-infant son.
For eight years, Christopher used the garage as a writing studio, tutoring center and storage space for the books, which he sold online. In 2015, he opened the space to the public as a store, arts hub and coffeehouse.
The city promptly shut it down, alleging a code violation, and it would take another year before he was able to prove the building's proper zoning and reopen. Christopher said he invested heavily in the property over the years because Gene Siegel promised him he'd have the first rights of refusal to buy the house and shop if the elder Siegel ever decided to sell.
That commitment was not written in any of the leases, which switched from an annual term to a month-to-month term in January.
Christopher is now working with an attorney to retrieve emails from a former property management company to prove Gene Siegel repeatedly made that promise in written communications.
The eviction notice was served Sept. 16, making Christopher's move-out date Nov. 16, but he won't be around. In December, he married an artist from Eastern Europe, and as part of her immigration proceedings, he must fly to her hometown Nov. 1-19 for a series of interviews. That leaves him with even less time to clear out or nail down a new lease deal.
Muehlhausen said he hopes his friend of five years is able to stay in Carlsbad Village. Lhooq Books is one of the few remaining independent bookstores in San Diego County and it's one of the features that reminds Muehlhausen of how Carlsbad used to be.
"Carlsbad is gentrifying and there's a lot of good that comes with that, but it's also losing a little of that unique personality it always had," Muehlhausen said. "I think if you're looking at something like a Sunset Magazine profile on a little town, Lhooq Books is the quirky kind of thing they'll point you to. It's these types of places that give a town its character and stand out in the crowd."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- A video depicting a macabre scene of a fake President Trump shooting, stabbing and brutally assaulting members of the news media and his political opponents was shown at a conference for his supporters at his Miami resort last week, according to footage obtained by The New York Times.
Several of Mr. Trump's top surrogates -- including his son Donald Trump Jr., his former spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders and the governor of Florida, Ron DeSantis -- were scheduled to speak at the three-day conference, which was held by a pro-Trump group, American Priority, at Trump National Doral Miami. Ms. Sanders and a person close to Mr. Trump's son said on Sunday that they did not see the video at the conference.
The video, which includes the logo for Mr. Trump's 2020 re-election campaign, comprises a series of internet memes. The most violent clip shows Mr. Trump's head superimposed on the body of a man opening fire inside the "Church of Fake News" on parishioners who have the faces of his critics or the logos of media organizations superimposed on their bodies. It appears to be an edited scene of a church massacre from the 2014 dark comedy film "Kingsman: The Secret Service."
The disclosure that the video was played shows how Mr. Trump's anti-media language has influenced his supporters and bled into their own propaganda. Mr. Trump has made attacks on the news media a mainstay of his presidency, and he tweeted a similar -- but far less violent video -- in 2017. In recent weeks as he has confronted impeachment proceedings, he has ramped up his attacks on the news media, repeatedly calling it the "enemy of the people."
A person who attended the conference last week took a video of the clip on his phone and had an intermediary send it to a reporter for The Times. Parts of the video were posted on YouTube in 2018 by a user with a history of creating pro-Trump mash-ups.
The organizer of the event said in a statement on Sunday that the clip had been played at the conference, saying it was part of a "meme exhibit." He denounced the video and said his organization was looking into how it was shown at the event.
"Content was submitted by third parties and was not associated with or endorsed by the conference in any official capacity," said the organizer, Alex Phillips. "American Priority rejects all political violence and aims to promote a healthy dialogue about the preservation of free speech. This matter is under review."
Organizers declined to say exactly where at Mr. Trump's resort the video was shown.
A person close to Mr. Trump's son said he was unaware that the video had been played at the conference. Ms. Sanders said she was unaware of the video's existence until a Times reporter contacted her.
"I was there to speak at a prayer breakfast, where I spoke about unity and bringing the country together," Ms. Sanders said. "I wasn't aware of any video, nor do I support violence of any kind against anyone."
A spokesman for Mr. Trump's campaign said he knew nothing about the video.
"That video was not produced by the campaign, and we do not condone violence," said Tim Murtaugh, the spokesman.
A DeSantis spokeswoman did not respond to an email seeking comment.
The video depicts a scene inside the "Church of Fake News," where parishioners rise as Mr. Trump -- dressed in a black pinstripe suit and tie -- walks down the aisle. Many parishioners' faces have been replaced with the logos of news media organizations, including PBS, NPR, Politico, The Washington Post and NBC.
Mr. Trump stops in the middle of the church, pulls a gun out of his suit jacket pocket and begins a graphic rampage. As the parishioners try to flee, the president fires at them. He shoots Black Lives Matter in the head, and also shoots Vice News.
Some of those in the church try to apprehend Mr. Trump. He fends them off and makes his way toward the altar, knocking over several pews. He wrestles a parishioner with a Vice News logo as a face to the ground and then shoots the person at point blank range. In the background, the former F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, is seen trying to get away.
From there, Mr. Trump attacks a range of his critics. He strikes the late Arizona senator John McCain in the back of the neck. He hits the television personality Rosie O'Donnell in the face and then stabs her in the head. He strikes Representative Maxine Waters, Democrat of California. He lights the head of Senator Bernie Sanders, a Democratic presidential rival, on fire.
He takes Senator Mitt Romney, Republican of Utah, hostage before throwing him to the ground. Then he strikes former President Barack Obama in the back and throws him against a wall.
Others shown in the video include Mika Brzezinski of MSNBC; former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton; former President Bill Clinton; the film producer Harvey Weinstein; and Representative Adam B. Schiff, the California Democrat who as chairman of the House Intelligence Committee is overseeing an impeachment inquiry of Mr. Trump.
The clip ends with Mr. Trump putting a stake into the head of a person with a CNN logo for a face. Mr. Trump then stands on the altar, admiring his rampage, and smiles.
The video is similar in style to one Mr. Trump tweeted in July 2017, in which he is shown at a wrestling match body slamming CNN's logo and beating it up. The president was roundly criticized for encouraging violence against journalists by posting that clip, but his supporters enjoyed it, and helped make the tweet viral.
Throughout his 2016 campaign and presidency, Mr. Trump has sought to demonize the news media, partly out of frustration about the coverage of his administration and partly because he likes to have an opponent to target. Mr. Trump has also sought to undermine confidence in the mainstream media, some of his advisers acknowledge privately, to make people doubt the accuracy of less favorable accounts of what goes on in his administration.
The president said at a rally on Friday that there was an "unholy alliance of corrupt Democrat politicians, deep-state bureaucrats and the fake news media."

Barr: Religious freedom at risk

Texto completo: SOUTH BEND – U.S. Attorney General William Barr on Friday decried what he saw as a concerted attack on religious freedom perpetrated by state governments that use laws as a "battering ram to establish moral relativism."
In a 37-minute speech at the University of Notre Dame's law school, Barr did not take questions from the media, which was escorted out of the room during a discussion period, but spoke passionately about "consequences of moral chaos" and the infringement of rights for organized religions and those of religious faith.
"Ground zero for these attacks on religion are the schools," Barr said. "To me this is the most serious challenge to religious liberty today."
When the "passing on of the faith" by parents to their children is impeded by the government, a "monstrous invasion of religious liberty" results, Barr said.
Confirmed to his post in February, Barr also referenced a recent lawsuit against the Archdiocese of Indianapolis regarding the rights of teachers in same-sex marriages to work in Catholic schools.
"This lawsuit clearly infringes on the First Amendment rights of the archdiocese by interfering both with its expressive association and with its church autonomy," Barr said. "The Department of Justice filed a statement of interest in the state court making these points and we hope that the state court will soon dismiss this case."
Barr's appearance sparked controversy as he recently became embroiled in the impeachment inquiry of President Donald Trump. According to USA TODAY, during a July 25 phone conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Trump offered to enlist Barr and Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, to help the Ukrainian government investigate Hunter Biden's business dealings with an energy company in the former Soviet republic.
The U.S. House of Representatives recently launched an inquiry into whether Trump should be impeached for allegedly linking aid to Ukraine to the investigation. Hunter Biden is the son of former Vice President Joe Biden, a leading Democratic candidate to oppose Trump in the 2020 presidential election.
According to reports, Barr also has contacted multiple foreign governments asking them for assistance with the Justice Department's investigation of possible Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.
Barr met privately Wednesday night with media kingpin Rupert Murdoch, a known Trump supporter, at Murdoch's New York home, The New York Times reported.
Barr spoke at Notre Dame's McCartan Courtroom in an event exclusively for law school students and faculty and members of the university's de Nicola Center for Ethics and Culture, which co-sponsored the event with the law school.
Barr's appearance only became publicly known in recent days and was not announced by the university. G. Marcus Cole, dean of the law school, sent a letter to students and staff on Wednesday evening and reportedly said the school will "neither endorse nor condemn invited speakers."
Cole's letter added that both speakers and protesters should be free to speak.
Andrew Cary, a Notre Dame graduate student, organized a Barr-related protest at a nearby intersection. Whistles were to be distributed in a nod to multiple whistleblowers contributing to the Ukraine controversy and subsequent impeachment inquiry.
Barr reportedly drew about 30 protesters at his Oct. 2 appearance at Wichita State, a public university. Barr's talk was part of a private roundtable discussion with Kansas law enforcement officials about federal, state and local law enforcement combating gun, drug and gang-related crime.
Earlier Friday, Notre Dame was announced as the host venue for the first 2020 presidential debate. The event will be held at Purcell Pavilion on Sept. 29.
"Our politics have been taken over by tweets and by slogans," Notre Dame President the Rev. John Jenkins said at a news conference to announce the debate. "We need to engage seriously about serious topics from across the political spectrum – the whole political spectrum. That has always been what Notre Dame is for. We've always welcomed leaders from the various parties, various speakers to talk seriously about issues."
Barr's youngest daughter, Meg, is a 2006 Notre Dame graduate who served as counsel for Sen. Mike Braun, R-Indiana. She fell ill with Hodgkins lymphoma while a Notre Dame student, and the care she received while enrolled built a "special connection," Barr said, between his family and the school.
Barr also said an uncle and two of his nephews attended Notre Dame as well as a relative who is currently enrolled.

Texto completo: The U.S. Supreme Court opened its new term last week by hearing arguments about whether states may abolish the insanity defense. Although the case the justices considered originated in Kansas, its resolution could reverberate as far away as Vermont, where a high-profile murder case involving an insanity defense led to intervention this summer by Gov. Phil Scott.
Kansas did away with the insanity defense in 1995, meaning that criminal defendants may no longer argue that, because of mental illness, they were unable to distinguish between right and wrong at the time the crime was committed.
In the case before the high court, a man convicted of killing four family members in 2011 was not permitted to argue that he was not guilty by reason of insanity even though an expert testified at his trial that he was so depressed at the time that he could not help himself.
His lawyer, Sarah Schrup, told the justices that a jury should have been allowed to make the determination and that barring the insanity defense was a sharp departure from the American legal tradition, The New York Times reported. “For centuries,” she said, “criminal culpability has hinged on the capacity for moral judgment, to discern and to choose between right and wrong. The insane lack that capacity.”
Indeed, English law has recognized some form of the insanity defense since the Middle Ages, and it was recognized in all jurisdictions in the United States until Kansas, Idaho, Montana and Utah abolished it toward the end of the last century.
Which brings us to Vermont.
In May, Chittenden County State’s Attorney Sarah George dismissed all charges against Aita Gurung, accused of killing his wife with a meat cleaver and severely wounding his mother-in-law shortly after being released from the University of Vermont Medical Center after a weeklong mental health evaluation. George explained that because both a court-appointed expert and one hired by the state had determined that Gurung was psychotic at the time of the attack, she would be unable to rebut his planned insanity defense and was therefore ethically obliged to drop the case.
Gov. Phil Scott then took the extraordinary step of intervening in a criminal case. He asked Attorney General TJ Donovan to review George’s decision to drop charges in the Gurung case and two others involving the insanity defense.
In due course, Donovan reversed George’s judgment and refiled murder charges against Gurung, which are now pending.
Gurung’s lawyer, Sandra Lee, was quick to conclude that since no new facts had come to light since George dismissed the charges, Donovan’s decision was political — something he adamantly denied. But the fact that Donovan is considering challenging Scott next year if the governor seeks another term does raise the specter that Scott’s letter seeking Donovan’s review of the cases was intended to put the attorney general on the spot and he reacted in a way calculated to shield his political future from the public outrage fueled by Scott’s intervention.
A more charitable interpretation is that Scott really does not understand the moral, ethical and legal issues involved, despite George’s best efforts to explain them. “From a layperson’s perspective, and certainly as Governor,” he wrote to Donovan in asking for the review, “I’m at a loss as to the logic or strategy behind this decision to drop all charges.”
We suspect that much of the public shares Scott’s confusion, but the elements are not fundamentally hard to grasp. Sometimes people who commit heinous crimes are not responsible for their conduct because they suffer from such acute mental illness that they cannot distinguish right from wrong.
Society has long recognized that those individuals should receive treatment for their illness rather than punishment. And prosecutors are obliged not to bring cases to trial that they believe cannot be proved beyond a reasonable doubt.
Scott has also said that he believed the Legislature would review the insanity defense in the future. If it does, perhaps it can be guided by the Supreme Court’s decision in the Kansas case, expected next year.
We hope that it is one that honors a long-established and well-grounded legal principle.

Texto completo: For the Monitor
Recently, after an evening spent discussing the Middle East, an international student who had previously introduced herself to me as “Turkish” came back to me as I was leaving. She said, as she was rewrapping the green headscarf she loosely wore: “I didn't tell you before – I'm really Kurdish. Sometimes I'm afraid to tell people.”
I don't blame her: Sometimes you don't know who will betray you.
Perhaps, in her eyes, as in mine, we are Perfidious America in the imagination of the Kurds.
Perhaps she believed that “the Kurds have no friends but the mountains,” as Mehmet Aksoy argued before ISIS killed him in 2017 during the fighting in Raqqa, Syria.
Raqqa was finally liberated from ISIS in 2019 by the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) with backing from an international coalition led by the United States.
Without the SDF it is unlikely that not only would the ISIS “Caliphate” not have been defeated but that approximately 12,000 ISIS fighters, along with 70,000 family members, would not today be prisoners in Syria.
If it were not for the Kurds Trump could not today claim, falsely, that ISIS had been defeated on his watch.
SDF's victories came at a terrible cost; thousands of Kurds died fighting a war that mostly benefits those in the West who most fear ISIS.
There are over 30 million Kurds spread mostly across the intersection between Iran, Turkey, Iraq and Syria, and including, according to The Times of Israel, almost 200,000 Kurdish Jews in Israel with over 30 agricultural villages founded by Kurdish Jews.
Considered the world's largest stateless ethnic group, the Kurds have been manipulated, exploited, repressed and betrayed, most notably by nations that have refused to acknowledge their Kurdish identity and demand for self-rule – most notably by the four countries in which they live.
This past Sunday night, two years after Mehmet Aksoy was killed, President Donald Trump tweeted that he was green-lighting a Turkish invasion of northern Syria, pitting America's Kurdish allies – who have fought shoulder to shoulder with American forces – against an enemy they consider a greater threat than ISIS; Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his assembled military might are determined to crush any Kurdish attempt at autonomy or freedom.
The following morning, New York Times columnist Paul Krugman questioned Trump's motives for his act of betrayal on Twitter: “So did Trump just betray the Kurds because / (a) He has business interests in Turkey / (b) Erdogan, being a brutal autocrat, is his kind of guy / (c) His boss Vladimir Putin told him to.”
I believe it's all the above.
While this is not the first time the Kurds have been betrayed, the reason for this betrayal is certainly the most craven: Trump betrayed the Kurds not only for all the above but because he is too ignorant, too unread, too selfish and too narcissistic to understand the fullness of his betrayal.
In 1920, as world powers dismembered the Ottoman Empire after World War I, Kurds were promised their own land under the Treaty of Sèvres – promises quickly abandoned by America, Britain and France as they pursued their own imperial interests.
By 1923, Ataturk's Turkish republic, having committed genocide against Turkey's Armenian Christian citizens, confronted Kurdish uprisings and crushed them. Later, having established repressive control over its Kurdish peoples, Turkey banned the Kurdish language and forced Kurds to “Turkify” their names, as well as the names of towns and villages.
Perhaps America's most grievous betrayal – not its last – came, in 1972, when Henry Kissinger agreed with the Shah of Iran to support a Kurdish uprising against Iraq's pro-Soviet Ba'athist Saddam Hussein.
The Kurdish leader, Mustafa Barzani, believing in Kissinger's and the shah's support, fought Iraq for three years, taking thousands of casualties.
Sadly, but predictably, in 1975, when the shah and Saddam kissed and made up, CIA support for Barazani, which Kissinger had arranged, ended and his forces were left to Saddam's tender mercies.
Barzani wrote to Kissinger, “Your Excellency, the United States has a moral and political responsibility to our people.”
There was no reply.
In 1975, when Kissinger, agent of Perfidious America, was asked by the House Intelligence Committee how he could justify the betrayal of the aspirations of the Kurds, he answered, “Covert action should not be confused with missionary work.”
Perhaps not missionary, but the betrayal of allies is a betrayal of the vision of America as a beacon on a hill.
Last December, when Trump made his first threat to withdraw U.S. troops from the fight against ISIS, believing, falsely, that the jihadis have been defeated, he was confronted, by Secretary of Defense General James Mattis.
Meeting in the Oval Office, Mattis made his case for keeping troops in Syria. After Trump rejected his arguments Mattis told the president, “You're going to have to get the next secretary of defense to lose to ISIS. I'm not going to do it. ”
Mattis wrote, in his resignation letter: “While the U.S. remains the indispensable nation in the free world, we cannot protect our interests or serve that role effectively without maintaining strong alliances and showing respect to those allies . . .
“My views on treating allies with respect and also being clear-eyed about both malign actors and strategic competitors are strongly held and informed by over four decades of immersion in these issues. We must do everything possible to advance an international order that is most conducive to our security, prosperity and values, and we are strengthened in this effort by the solidarity of our alliances.”
Previous betrayals of the Kurds, however covert and cynical, were based on some geo-strategic calculation. Trump's betrayal is not just naiveté, it's a manifestation of the worst of Perfidious America, a disdain for allies and for international order manifest in ignorance and impetuousness that puts not just Kurds but all of us in jeopardy.
Today, that the Kurds “have no friends but the mountains” is sadly more true than ever.

BOOK REVIEW; For Cathleen Schine, bed is her workspace

Texto completo: After the 2016 presidential election, novelist Cathleen Schine decided to take to her bed. Not for rest but to write.
The bed, according to Schine's wry logic, is simply a better, softer desk. "It's this huge expanse," she says, "you have all your stuff, and there's room for lunch."
She wanted to write "something funny and kind of separate from the real world." But for a year, she flailed. After 10 family-centric comic novels, including the bestsellers "The Three Weismanns of Westport," "The Love Letter" and "The New Yorkers," had she finally run dry?

Then Schine tapped into an endearing and slyly philosophical story that crosses the high spirit of Jane Austen with William Safire's long-running New York Times' "On Language" column.
The result is "The Grammarians," an intelligent escapist read for contentious times when the way we use words can reveal so much about our identity, our education, our worldview.
The novel's flame-haired twins were born when someone reminded Schine of the feud between twin sisters and competing advice columnists Dear Abby and Ask Ann Landers. The Friedman women, born Pauline Esther (Abby) and Esther Pauline (Ann), were estranged for decades.
Schine, no fan of the advice genre, transposed the notion of warring siblings to something she loves: grammar, the persnickety or pleasurable enforcement of linguistic order and dignity.
In exacting and good-humored prose, "The Grammarians" tracks the Wolfe twins' cozy childhood and then their young adulthood in '80s Manhattan as they push the boundaries of closeness. They eventually take divergent paths: Laurel becomes a poet and Daphne is a copy editor with a popular column called "The People's Pedant."
After a rich career that started in 1983 with "Alice in Bed," Schine has earned some of her strongest reviews for "The Grammarians." "I'm relieved," she says, "because it's a strange little book. It's so sort of idiosyncratic and personal to me that I really wasn't sure if anybody else would respond to it."
On a recent day in her airy Venice home, Schine, in black-framed eyeglasses and a crisp white shirt, relaxes in an antique chair, talking about her work. The free-ranging conversation is much like "The Grammarians." She starts off talking about language and books, then delves into idiosyncratic and personal territory.
The focal point of "The Grammarians" -- "Webster's New International Dictionary of the English Language," Second Edition -- occupies a table next to the couch. This is the downstairs copy; Schine has another within reach of her writing bed. She's fascinated by Webster's history, particularly its non-pejorative treatment of slang words such as "ain't" in the third edition published in 1961.
In "The Grammarians," Laurel and Daphne Wolfe speak a secret twin language that unnerves their psychiatrist uncle and baffles their affectionate mother, Sally. When their father, Arthur, brings home the Webster's New International Dictionary, the girls' obsession with words ramps up. They record beloved oddities such as whilom (definition: former) and oxters (arm-pits) in a notebook, and then "played with the words as if they were toys."
Laurel, the elder by minutes, is more self-assured, but it is Daphne who finds professional success first as standard English's stalwart guardian. She wags her finger at the barbarians for not knowing when to use "continuous" instead of "continual."
When asked if she's a Laurel or a Daphne, Schine says she went back and forth. On one hand, she cringes at the incorrect usage of "who" instead of "whom." On the other, she loves Twitter, where language is regularly chewed up like taffy. The conflict between Daphne and Laurel, Schine says, is a whole worldview: "It's authoritarianism versus nihilism ... but all in this context of how we speak, and how we write and how we relate to words, and also to each other."
Not only do Daphne and Laurel tussle over linguistics, their life choices fracture their relationship as well. When Laurel has a child and leaves her job teaching kindergarten, Daphne is appalled by her sister's desire to be a stay-at-home mom. The argument hints at an old struggle to define feminine identity: by career or children or both (and if both, how)?
Schine, now 66, has steered through several shifts in identity. Growing up in Westport, Conn., with a mother who worked (much to her father's annoyance) and eventually got a Ph.D., Schine grew up privileged, thinking she "could do anything I wanted to do."
By the time she was a freshman at Sarah Lawrence in 1971, despite protesting the Vietnam War in high school, her interest in politics had evaporated. At college, "It was all like theater and everyone was beautiful and got dressed up for dinner, and I just didn't want any politics in my life."
She moved to New York City, married New Yorker film critic David Denby, raised two sons and steadily published. The couple had an apartment on the Upper West Side and other signifiers of the good life, but around 2000, they divorced amicably.
Around the same time, Schine realized she was queer. In her late 40s, Schine was navigating divorce, co-parenting and a new sexual identity.
"A lot of people before me made it much easier [to come out]. It wasn't like today, but it was still a big deal. People said to me, 'Oh, do you think you'll be invited to dinner parties anymore?' You know, stuff like that. And I thought, 'Honestly, I hate dinner parties, so fine.' "
Now married to Hollywood filmmaker-producer Janet Meyers, Schine credits the coming-out process with opening her eyes to the marginalization of others.
Schine moved to the West Coast seven years ago, though she still flies to New York nearly once a month to care for her mother. She jokes that it'll take her another 30 years to actually set a book in L.A. and not New York. Her latest project is bubbling up, despite her disbelief.
"Wow, I've had 11 ideas. Why on Earth would I have 12?"
Still, something vague is itching at her. She'll take to her bed to find out more.

Texto completo: JAMESBURG – Murder? Mayhem? Malice? All the better for this group.
On the fourth Saturday of every month, you will find like-minded women and men chatting about poisons and plots in the Jamesburg Senior Center.
A support group for potential serial killers? Nah....it's just the monthly meeting for Sisters In Crime Central Jersey, the state chapter for an international organization (SinC) with more than 51 chapters worldwide for those in the mystery/crime writing genre.
Seeking equality A precursor to the "#MeToo" movement, the women crime writers wanted to "be treated as equally as male writers" and to "have equality and recognition in the field," said Linda Rawlins, president of the SinC Central Jersey chapter, which has about 40 members.
"They weren't getting as many contracts from agents," she said. "Even when they did get contracts, they didn't get paid the same."
The initial members had some heavy hitters among them, including Sara Paretsky and Nancy Pickard, who served as the first and second presidents of the organization. Other founding members included Phyllis Whitney and Mary Higgins Clark.
Now with about 4,000 members, SinC offers networking, advice and support to mystery authors — both men and women published and unpublished. The membership is a mix of authors, readers, publishers, editors, agents, booksellers and librarians all connected through their love of the mystery genre and support of women who write them.
Around for more than 20 years, Rawlins said the Jersey group is a mix, with about 75 percent of the members being writers. Most others are readers and former librarians. They also come from all over the state, as SinC Central Jersey is the only New Jersey chapter.
"It's all about inclusivity now. Our group, we tease — we call it sisters and misters," said Rawlins, who joined SinC three years ago. "Now, everybody is allowed. Anybody who is interested in being in the organization."
A published author Rawlins, a published author, started writing seriously in 2010 and her first book came out in 2011. She has now published seven books and expects an eighth come out soon.
"One thing you learn about writing books is that you really need a good network — a good community," said Rawlins, who lives in Fairfield. "And you need to speak to other writers. Being a writer can be sort of an isolating position. I wanted to join a networking community and I love mysteries, so I joined Sisters in Crime nationally and then the local chapter."
Her popular "Misty" series has four books out — "Misty Manor," "Misty Point," "Misty Winter" and "Misty Treasure" — with a fifth, as yet untitled, on the way. All center around journalist Megan Stanford who comes home to the Jersey Shore when her grandmother becomes ill — then the mayhem begins and the dead bodies pile up.
"I love mysteries and I personally — and most everybody in the group — grew up on mysteries," she said. "The reason that we are drawn to SinC is that we love some sort of crime fiction."
Crime comes to Central Jersey Rawlins said she has tried to "modernize" the group. Often, they schedule Skype meetings with authors and experts in the field such as New York Times bestselling author Tosca Lee and ThrillerFest organizer Kimberly Howe. Handwriting analyst Terry Antoniewicz and Wendy Corsi Staub, bestselling author of the Lily Dale and The Foundling series, also recently came in person to a meeting.
"It gives us a much broader availability of writers to mentor us," Rawlins said. "We always try to have a speaker come in to look at some facet of your writing career. One month we may be talking about social media and marketing and the next month, we could be having the FBI or police or firemen come in to help us with the reality of our work."
Another new thing Rawlins started was an open mic session where writers can get up in front of a group audience. The group also has fun on their agenda as they celebrate literary birthdays and holidays together.
The group is looking to attract new members and Rawlins noted many younger members grew up with J.K. Rowling and the Harry Potter series as their main inspiration as opposed to Agatha Christie, Nancy Drew or Phyllis Whitney. They are "big into advocacy" for writers of all levels," she said.
"We have been working more on the business end of it — how to write, how to edit, how to polish a query letter, how to approach a publisher, how to self publish, how to market — those kind of nuts and bolts," she said. "I think part of the advocacy is to go back to the nuts and bolts of how to be a writer."
While the mystery genre goes through phases, cozy and young adult fiction are currently topping the popularity charts, Rawlins said
"Personally I'm happy to see, despite what we hear about cell phones and such, that reading is still very very strong," she said. "I think anytime we can advocate for literacy, we need to do that. It is so important for our society. But it's nice to see a lot of people reading out there — of all ages. I still feel reading is so important in every aspect of life."
The SinC Central Jersey will be appearing at the Old Bridge Public Library, One Old Bridge Plaza, from 2 to 4 p.m. Oct. 19. Also on Oct. 19, SinC Central Jersey writers will appear at the Jamesburg Street Fair. For their monthly meeting, the group will gather at 10 a.m. Oct. 26 for their annual Edgar Allan Poe Party. Special guest Irene Curran will discuss Poe's life. The Boucheron Conference will take place From Oct. 31 to Nov. 3 in Texas and from Nov. 7 to 10, the Crime Bake Mystery Conference will be held in Boston, Massachusetts. On Dec. 7, SinC Central Jersey will host their annual Holiday Party at 10 a.m.

Texto completo: These past few weeks we’ve been discussing “omissions” (you can decide whether these are errors or sins). As an estate planning attorney, I instantly think of “omitted heirs.” And you may think, “huh?”
An omitted heir is a person who would have inherited by law but was not mentioned in a will or trust. A related concept is “pretermitted heir”– someone who was born to, adopted by, or married to the deceased after the date of the will. Both situations have legal consequences, which may or may not have been intended.
Occasionally, I meet with a client who intends to disinherit a child. We always state that clearly and upfront in the will with a statement such as “I have intentionally not provided for my child Badly Behaving Bob and for all purposes hereunder he is to be treated as having predeceased me,” and sometimes we add “leaving no issue” if the client also wishes to disinherit any of Bob’s children (and let’s face it, if the behavior was bad enough those grandchildren could be sprinkled across the globe). This can make clients uncomfortable. But there is a reason for it.
California law
California provides that in the case of an omitted or pretermitted heir the heir will inherit an intestate share (what they would have received had there been no will at all) except in some specific circumstances. In other words, the law assumes you mean to provide for your children, with only a few exceptions, which are:
* The decedent’s failure to provide for the child was intentional and that intention appears from the testamentary instruments.
* The decedent had one or more children and devised or otherwise directed the disposition of substantially all the estate to the other parent of the omitted child.
* The decedent provided for the child by transfer outside of the estate, and the intention that the transfer be in lieu of a provision in said instruments is shown by statements of the decedent or by other evidence.
California law also provides that if at the time the decedent executed the estate plan they failed to provide for a child solely because they were unaware of the child or believed the child was deceased, the child will be entitled to take a share of the decedent’s estate.
Thus, documenting your wishes and intentions becomes important in these situations. And disclosing to your attorney any children, stepchildren, adopted children, or possible children you may have is also extremely important.
Celebrity omissions
Remember when actor Heath Ledger died, leaving behind 2-year-old Matilda, his daughter with Michelle Williams? Ledger’s will pre-dated Matilda’s birth by several years and left everything to his sisters and parents.
His will was signed when his assets were estimated at just above $100,000. When he died, his net worth was said to be more than $16 million. Luckily for Matilda, Ledger’s family agreed to give it all to her and no court battle ensued. Ledger was an Australian citizen; in California, the pretermitted heir law would have given the estate to Matilda anyway, but with a greedier family, a long court battle would have likely ensued.
The family of Michael Crichton, creator of Jurassic Park and ER, was not so lucky. At the time of his death in 2008, he was 66 years old and left behind four ex-wives, a 20-year-old daughter, and a new wife who was six months pregnant.
Crichton executed a will and trust in 2007 and specifically stated, “I have intentionally made no provision in this will for any of my heirs or relatives who are not herein mentioned or designated, and I hereby generally and specifically disinherit every person claiming to be or who may be determined to be my heir-at-law, except as otherwise mentioned in this will.”
If Crichton had updated his estate plan when he learned his wife was expecting, a protracted battle between his daughter (who thought that provision should apply to disinherit her half-brother) and the mother of his son (who had a prenup but fought on behalf of her son) could have been avoided. The court eventually ruled that Crichton’s son was entitled to one-third of his estate as a pretermitted heir since his son was not conceived or known of at the time the will was executed.
Crichton’s $100 million art collection soon went to auction at Christie’s to begin making distributions (and paying legal fees, no doubt).
When is a child not a child?
It is equally important to name those who may not be considered “children” by law. It’s not uncommon for a child to take the last name of a stepfather so that mom, stepdad and child all had the same name and to the world at large they were a family. This is particularly true if biological dad is not part of the child’s life.
But if stepdad did not legally adopt the child, the child will not be a legal heir. The stepdad would need to specifically state that he intended to treat the child as his own.
You forgot you were married?
The laws are similar for omitted spouses. When a testamentary document is executed before a marriage and does not mention the spouse, the surviving spouse will be considered a pretermitted heir entitled to all the community property and a share of separate property.
No contest
If you do intend to disinherit a child or a spouse, you will need to carefully state as much in clear language in your will or trust.
In some circumstances, however, you may want to consider a gift to that person instead. I know that sounds nuts, but hear me out. Most folks are aware of the “no-contest” provisions in testamentary documents — that’s the clause that says “if anyone contests this document, they inherit nothing.”
If you’ve completely disinherited someone, they have nothing to lose by contesting your plan. Instead, if you’ve given them a gift at least they have the loss of that gift to consider.
Let me not omit the best advice of all — implement and regularly review your estate plan.

Texto completo: Hoy abrió al público una plataforma de observación de vidrio en el piso 102 del Empire State Building que ofrece vistas de 360 ​​grados de la ciudad, en un ambiente sin paredes.
La apertura marca el comienzo de lo que los diseñadores llaman la “Experiencia del Observatorio”, resultado de cuatro años y $165 millones de dólares en renovaciones destinadas a resolver las largas colas y la congestión para hacer más atractiva la visita al edificio más famoso de Nueva York y quizá EEUU.
Después de ingresar, ahora a través de la calle 34 en lugar de la 5ta Avenida, los visitantes pasan por la fascinante arquitectura art deco y un modelo de 24 pies del edificio antes de acceder a una exhibición de 10 mil pies cuadrados sobre la historia del edificio abierto en 1931.
La exhibición dinámica y digital impulsa a los visitantes hacia los ascensores que transportan, en 55 segundos, a la cubierta del piso 86.
Los visitantes pueden ir al piso 102 pagando $20 dólares adicionales. Una variedad de beneficios, como tours privados y pases sin colas también están disponibles en paquetes que cuestan hasta $460, describió el New York Times.
“Es, simplemente, una vista inigualable”, dijo el jueves Jean-Yves Ghazi, presidente de Empire State Realty Trust, la compañía propietaria del edificio.
“Somos el punto en el mapa que mantiene unida a esta ciudad”, agregó. “Hay mucho significado aquí. La altura no es el marcador; se trata del estatus icónico de este lugar”.
El mirador en el piso 102 ofrecerá a grupos de unas 55 personas la oportunidad de ver Nueva York desde el panorama más alto de 360 ​​grados en la ciudad , destacó Ghazi.
El observatorio es completamente transparente. Los que se atreven pueden mirar directamente a las calles de abajo.
“Nunca ha habido un mejor momento para darle una nueva mirada” a la ciudad, escribió James S. Russell, recomendando que hasta los neoyorquinos y turistas que han subido al mirador del Empire State deberían volver ahora a redescubrirlo.
* ¿Cuáles son los 10 rascacielos más altos de Nueva York en la actualidad?
* Nueva York tendrá la terraza panorámica más alta del hemisferio, con piso transparente en Hudson Yards

Texto completo: The greatest streaker in New York City Marathon history is coming back to Steamtown.
No, not that kind of streaker.
This streaker, as he’s known in racing parlance, has finished every NYC Marathon since 1976.
Not started. Finished.
Retired New York City public schools music teacher Dave Obelkevich has completed 42 in a row.
There are just nine runners who have finished all 23 Steamtown Marathons from Forest City to Courthouse Square in Scranton, the same 26.2 miles some 1,200 runners will try to cover Sunday.
At age 83, Jermyn’s Tony Cerminaro is the oldest to have finished every Steamtown run. He’s joined by Scott Township’s Nancy Werthmuller (68), Scranton’s Joel Adamski (66), William Lawrence (60) and Lackawanna County Commissioner Patrick O’Malley (50), Dickson City’s Mike May (60), Jermyn’s Jeffrey Ginsberg (54), Hanover Township’s Patty Phillips-Pavlock (64) and Wheeling, West Virginia’s Adrian Fedorco (64).
But the 76-year-old Obelkevich, back to run his fourth Steamtown Marathon, explains that his history of finishes comes with a footnote.
“If someone says the numbers don’t add up (1976-2018), that’s because in 2012 there was no marathon,” said Obelkevich, who has completed 110 marathons and over 200 ultramarathons.
Well, there was no “official” marathon that year, or the streak would be 43, even if he did run 26.2 miles that fateful weekend.
“Hurricane Sandy went through the week before and the mayor cancelled the race Friday afternoon,” Obelkevich recounted. “So, there were hundreds of people there from foreign countries there to run the race. Come race day, I’d say a few thousand people showed up in Central Park.”
A reporter from The New York Times was there, too, detailing the remarkable scene.
“He said it was beyond belief because the race was cancelled,” Obelkevich said. “Some clubs even set up a water stop. And people ran four loops of the park for 24 miles, and I was one of them. Four loops of Central Park, a lower loop, which was 1.7 (miles), and then you’re still a few tenths short, so we ran from the start to Columbus Circle.”
Obelkevich flips through the notebook dedicated to his race results to detail his best time in New York: 2 hours, 40 minutes, 34 seconds in 1984. For Steamtown, his times are 4 hours, 45 minutes, in both 2013 and 2014, and 4:04 in 2009.
“I ran much of that race with a woman who said five or six words,” Obelkevich said. “I think I’ll be closer to six hours this year. Is the course open that long?”
He’s not a threat to win his age group, nor is he trying. It’s all about finishing a race where his family roots started.
His father, who died in 1974, was born in Forest City and moved to Throop as a youngster. Obelkevich doesn’t know how long his dad lived here, just that it’s part of his deep consciousness that makes Steamtown important to him.
But that streak, there’s a great sense of pride that goes with something that had such a peculiar start.
“I tell myself I ran in the 1973 marathon,” Obelkevich said. “It was on my birthday, and until 1976, 1970-75, it was four loops of Central Park and then a lower loop. I went in on the West Side of Central Park and saw Tom Fleming flying down the hill, the guy who won it. I shook my head and said, ‘I can’t keep up with him.’
“Here comes No. 2, here comes No. 72, here comes No. 75, and I said, ‘He’s not going all that fast’ so without a number I just hopped in. There might have been 27 spectators. It was very, very low key. After one loop of the park, which is 6 miles, in 43 minutes, I really got turned on to the race. I said I’ll get a number and run next year.”
He ran 1974 with an unusual training regimen.
“So I ran 4 hours, 20 minutes. Know what my weekly mileage was? Six miles,” Obelkevich said. “I took six days off and ran on Sunday. Isn’t that what you are supposed to do? I came across this article in a German magazine and a coach said you can do it on eight miles a week. I never felt worse after a race.”
Well, maybe the next year, when he had to drop out late because of repeated dizzy spells.
But even that broken rib 17 years ago didn’t slow him down.
From the Four Corners Marathon in New Mexico to the Comrades ultramarathon in South Africa - where he picked up his colorful shorts that he’ll wear Sunday, an homage to completing that 55-mile race 10 times, he’s seen a lot.
“In terms of people, I’ve met a lot of wonderful people,” Obelkevich said. “I met my wife (Lyn Dominguez) through running. I’ve been to quite a few countries. I’ve been to nine or 10 states, sometimes just to run a marathon. It’s opened up so many doors for me.
“Playing a musical instrument at age 76 is not a major achievement, but running marathons and longer at age 76 is pretty unusual.”
Of the people who ran at New York in 1976, Obelkevich thinks there are three or four still running. Nowadays, he runs three or four races a year, down from the 10 to 15 ultramarathons he once completed.
His times have slowed dramatically, but that doesn’t matter.
“I consider myself lucky,” Obelkevich said.

Texto completo: An author scheduled to speak at Georgia Southern's Armstrong campus on Thursday canceled her scheduled event after an incident during her Wednesday appearance at the university's Statesboro campus that resulted in several people who appeared to be students being videoed burning her book following the lecture.
Outrage from students and alumni of Georgia Southern under the #southernnotstate hashtag on Twitter followed the incident after video surfaced of students at the Statesboro campus burning a visiting author's book after she discussed white privilege during her lecture and questions and answers.
On Wednesday, Latina author and New York Times contributor Jennine Capó Crucet discussed her book, "Make Your Home Among Strangers," to an audience of freshmen students at the Statesboro campus. The book, which is required reading for some Georgia Southern Freshman Year Experience classes, follows a Cuban-American student going to college at a predominantly white educational institution.
During the Q&A portion of her lecture, one student confronted Crucet about the view on white privilege expressed in the book. In a video posted by user @___yanamarie on Twitter,the student asks Crucet, "So I've noticed you've made a
lot of generalizations about the majority of white people being privileged and I just wanted to know what makes you qualified to come to a college campus?"
The student then quickly corrects the comment by stating the student understands Crucet has qualifications before Crucet interjects and tells the Statesboro audience it feels like deja vu.
"I'm asking you what makes you think you can come to a college campus like this when we're supposed to be promoting diversity throughout this campus, which is what we're taught?" the student continues on the video.
In the video, some in the auditorium sound off with comments before she completes her question.
"I just would like to know why you came here to tell all of these people that white people are privileged, I don't really understand what the purpose of this was?" the student asked in the video.
Crucet responded by saying white privilege was a real thing and she was invited to come talk at the university. The video ends with Crucet stating she was heartbroken because she had just discussed a moment similar to this one happening. The almost two-and-a-half minute video had been viewed more that 30,000 times by mid-Friday.
On Twitter, Georgia Southern students, alumni and others tweeted their positions after learning some students burned her book:
Twitter user @https_Kieraaa tweeted: "Welcome to my PWI where we brush the actions of privileged children under the rug and ignore the fact that they followed her home.#GSU #SouthernNotState #WhitePrivilegeAtItsFinest."
Twitter user @ball_for_life72 tweeted: "I normally don't speak on these subjects, but I feel like this controversy is something that should definitely be brought to attention! White privilege is a very important topic when teaching Diversity Inclusion! #georgiasouthern #gsu22 #gsu21 #gsu20 #gsu23 #SouthernNotState."
According to Georgia Southern University Communications and Marketing Vice President John Lester, the burning of the book was within the students' First Amendment rights but did not align with Georgia Southern's values nor did it encourage civil discourse and debate of ideas.
"We view these events as a continuing debate of differing ideas, which are tenets of our ongoing efforts to align with our values and initiatives encompassing inclusive excellence," Lester said.
As of Friday, Georgia Southern did not know how many students were involved in the book burning incident on the Statesboro campus, and Crucet declined to talk at the Armstrong campus in Savannah on Thursday due to safety concerns.
In an official statement on her Twitter account, Crucet said campus hosts moved her initial lodging to another hotel, and she later learned in a statement from a faculty member that a crowd had formed outside the original accommodations. Crucet also said that some students apologized for overall reaction from the initial question pertaining to white privilege. She also said how some Georgia Southern students reached out during and afterward on how her book mirrored their own journeys.
"To think of those students watching as a group of their peers burned that story - effectively erasing them on the campus they are expected to think of as a safe space - feels devastating," the statement reads.

Cats bond with humans as much as dogs

Texto completo: As humans spend more time with other animals learning about their intelligence and emotional states, many long-held beliefs fall regularly by the wayside as we find crows using tools, elephants visiting their dead relatives' graves, and octopuses playing with toys.
One assumption regularly popping up on TV and social media feeds is the claim that cats tolerate humans but don't really care about us except as a food bringer – and they certainly don't bond with us. Or if they do, it's nothing on the level of how "man's best friend" the dog bonds with us.
New research from the Human-Animal Interaction Lab at Oregon State University looked into this and confirmed what many cat lovers – among which I include myself – already knew: Cats develop strong bonds with humans. But what was surprising about the study was just how much more prevalent those bonds are. Researchers found that cats may bond with humans more than dogs and about as much as infants do. The study was published in last month's issue of the scientific journal Current Biology.
Researchers used something called a "secure base test," an experiment that's been long-used to measure bonds that dogs, primates and even infants form with caretakers. Cat and kitten owners would bring their pets to a laboratory room where the cats had never been. The owner and the cat would sit in the room together for two minutes. Then the owner would leave so the cat would be alone, creating a mild stressor for the cat. And finally the owner would return after two minutes.
What happens next in the room is what the researchers are really interested in: how the cat reacts to the return of his or her person.
Sixty-five percent greeted their people and then went about exploring the room, occasionally returning to their person. To the researchers, this signified a cat who is securely attached to their person, viewing them as a safe base in an unfamiliar environment.
"This may be an adaptation of the bond they would have with their parents when they were young," the study's lead author, Krysten Vitale, told the New York Times. She added that this behavior may mean: "Everything's OK. My owner's back, I feel comforted and reassured, and now I can go back to exploring."
About 35 percent of the cats avoided their owners or clung to them when they returned. This indicates to researchers that they do not see their owners as a source of security and stress relief.
When the same test is done with infants, about 65 percent display secure attachment to their caretakers – the same as cats. As for dogs, about 58 percent view their person as a source of security.
"I think there's this idea that cats don't really depend on their owner and need them," Vitale told Popular Science magazine. "But at least in this test, what we're seeing is that most cats use their owner for their sense of security."
In other words, cats depend on us a lot more than common wisdom would have us believe. This brings to mind the many great cats living at area shelters right now. Adoption could literally be a lifesaver for them – and they would finally have a home that's their secure base.

Texto completo: Under Trump, the U.S. becomes the world's fair-weather friend.
The time is the early 1980s. The place is the South China Sea. A sailor aboard the U.S.S. Midway, an aircraft carrier, spots a leaky boat jammed with people fleeing tyranny in Indochina. As he helps bring the desperate refugees to safety, one of them calls out: "Hello, American sailor -- Hello, Freedom Man."
It's the sort of story Americans used to like hearing about themselves. So much so, in fact, that Ronald Reagan told it in his 1989 farewell address, by way of underscoring how much went right for the United States when, as he put it, "We stood, again, for freedom."
Not anymore. When the world looks at the United States today, it sings a sorry song. Goodbye America. Goodbye, Freedom Man.
That's the global lesson from the regional catastrophe that is Donald Trump's retreat in Syria. The president made his case, as he usually does, in a series of tweets this week. Like their author, the tweets were, by turns, sophomoric and self-important, flippant and destructive.
He praised the Kurds as "special people and wonderful fighters" who "in no way have we Abandoned" -- and yet he abandoned them.
He praised Turkey for being "good to deal with" and "an important member in good standing of NATO" -- after warning that he would "totally destroy and obliterate" its economy if it did anything he didn't like.
He boasted that "The stupid endless wars, for us, are ending!" -- but took the one step most likely to speed their resumption and expansion.
And he congratulated himself for his "great and unmatched wisdom." Of course.
Closer to the mark in assessing the results of American withdrawal was Javad Zarif, the Iranian foreign minister, who said of the U.S. that it was "futile to seek its permission or rely on it for security."
To survive the Turkish onslaught, the Kurdish forces we have cavalierly betrayed will now have little choice except to try to reach an accommodation with Bashar al-Assad. This will allow the Damascene dictator to consolidate his grip on the country he has brutalized for nearly 20 years -- demonstrating to autocrats everywhere that using sarin gas, barrel bombs, hunger blockades, and every other barbaric method against defenseless civilians pays.
Trump's withdrawal will do worse than that.
It will put thousands of Kurdish lives in jeopardy. It will deepen Tehran's influence in Syria. It will increase the likelihood of all-out war between Israel and Iran. It will underscore the inefficacy of U.S. sanctions to curb Tehran's ambitions. It will ratify the wisdom of Vladimir Putin's decision to intervene on Assad's behalf. It will strengthen Turkish strongman Recep Tayyip Erdogan's hand, not only in northern Syria but also in Turkish politics, just as he was finally beginning to experience serious reversals after 16 years in power.
And it will fundamentally jeopardize the gains made against the Islamic State, around 10,000 of whose fighters are in the custody of the Kurdish forces now being attacked. As Mazloum Abdi, the commander of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, told Bloomberg's Eli Lake, "If we think the Turkish operation will not stop, we cannot fight ISIS anymore."
Trump thus repeats Barack Obama's mistake in Iraq of declaring success, pulling out, and creating the security and political vacuums which ISIS, Iran and other bad actors were quick to fill. That alone should have been enough to dissuade this president from pursuing his course.
Except that Trump's instinctive need to appease dictators appears to be even more powerful than his aversion to imitating his predecessor. Distracting attention from impeachment surely played a role, too, based on the view that ending "stupid endless wars" is generally a political winner -- at least until the consequences of our geopolitical fecklessness are again felt fatally at home.
All of which makes it noteworthy that Trump's Kurdish betrayal has elicited such a political backlash, including among some of his more reliable lackeys in the Republican caucus. People like Senator Lindsey Graham understand that what the U.S. is now doing isn't simply foreign policy folly. It's a national disgrace.
It's a signal that Americans are the friends you never want: there for you when, and only when, it's convenient for them. It's evidence that our moral values are tissue paper around the glass fragments of our president's ego. It's proof that the idealism that stormed Normandy, fed Europe, democratized Japan, and kept West Berlin free belongs to an increasingly remote past.
It means that American sailor or soldier seen on the horizon is no longer "freedom man." He's fair-weather friend.
Even now, this is not how most Americans, including many of Trump's supporters, would wish to see themselves. People on their way to the bottom have their occasional moments of clarity, seldom seized. In the Syria debacle, Republicans have a chance to see, if not save, themselves.

Texto completo: Three mental health professionals who contributed to "The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump" cite recent actions that confirm their worries.
To the Editor:
Re "Trump Flies Into the Cuckoo's Nest" (column, Oct. 10):
Gail Collins makes a point that we have been articulating seriously since the publication of our book, "The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump," two years ago: President Trump is mentally unfit for office. Our publications have been derided as violations of the Goldwater Rule, "armchair psychiatry" and political bias dressed up as professional opinions.
But, as mental health professionals, we have felt a duty to address a public health crisis: a mentally unfit person in charge of the world's most powerful military and its nuclear weapons. We have found ample evidence of his instability and grandiosity in the president's own words and public statements, most recently confirmed in his referring to "my great and unmatched wisdom," coupled with yet another threat to "totally destroy and obliterate" a foreign country.
Mr. Trump's now familiar affinity for violence is manifest in his verbal threats and his incitement to violence at his rallies. He reacts viscerally and without reflection or consultation, now claiming "treason" and an attempted "coup." As he confronts the humiliating prospect of impeachment, his psychological deterioration represents a clear and imminent risk.
Our observations are not "diagnosing" and do not refer to mental illness; rather, they speak to a lack of fitness that can be determined based on sufficient sources outside of a personal examination.

Like 'Working in a Prison': Six Years in the Hell of Syria's Hospitals

Texto completo: ELAZIG, Turkey -- "This is my little hero," the surgeon said, showing off a photo of a baby drinking from a bottle, her head heavily bandaged.
The picture was no family snapshot, but a memento of one of the youngest patients Dr. Omar Ibrahim, a 32-year-old Egyptian neurosurgeon, had saved during six years volunteering in the war in Syria.
Six-month-old Fatima had arrived at his field hospital in the besieged city of Aleppo comatose and in spasm, with a shrapnel injury to her brain, he said. "It was my first time to do this type of operation," he recalled. "It was just me. I was nervous. What if she died or if I injured her brain?"
After six years working in basements under bombardment in one of the world's most dangerous war zones, Dr. Ibrahim has been granted entry into Turkey and is finally taking a break. Drinking tea on a wooded university campus in the town of Elazig in eastern Turkey last month, he flicked through photos and videos on his cellphone, recalling the worst and best moments working just yards from the front line.
Fatima survived, and he carries a second photo on his cellphone showing the moment she emerged from a coma, opened her mouth, and yelled. "Babies' brains are very flexible," he said. "We had amazing recoveries of babies, really amazing."
The son of an accountant from the middle-sized city of Sohag on the upper reaches of the Nile in Egypt, Dr. Ibrahim never planned to go to war. He had thought to go to Britain to pursue a career as a neurosurgeon.
But the Arab Spring intervened.
He was still in medical school in Sohag and watched from the sidelines when Egypt was convulsed by demonstrations that brought down President Hosni Mubarak in 2011. Later, he joined meetings and helped treat wounded demonstrators when clashes broke out with the police.
"We all felt something had to be changed," he said.
Egypt offered little to his generation of graduates. "Corruption, the health system, education," were all concerns, he said. Low salaries and a lack of equipment and drugs in Egypt meant that most doctors looked abroad to pursue a career, he said. None of his four brothers, all college educated, found permanent employment in Egypt.
In 2013, when the revolution was crushed and President Mohamed Morsi and his supporters were jailed, Dr. Ibrahim joined an exodus of young, educated Egyptians. "We all felt the revolution was finished," he said. "There was a huge wave of depression."
He was 26 and halfway through his residency at Sohag University Hospital when he saw an appeal for doctors in Syria. Protests in Syria against President Bashar al-Assad had by then developed into a full-scale armed conflict, and he saw an opportunity to help.
It was not the career move that Dr. Ibrahim had planned, but he took it. "I wanted to take the risk to start somewhere to achieve something good," he said.
It was an easy two-day trip to the war zone. In Aleppo, with medical personnel fleeing, an extra surgeon was welcomed and he settled in.
He missed home cooking and lost weight, though. "They use a lot of lemon and don't like salt," he complained of Syrian cooking. He kept in touch with his family, but never told them he was in Syria. "I said I was on the Turkish border helping refugees."
For the first few months, with no equipment, the doctors could only stabilize patients with brain injuries and send them by car to Turkey, a dangerous drive of several hours. Most patients died on the way, or overnight awaiting transfer, he said.
That changed when he and his colleagues found and repaired an old CT scanner. "It was like from the 19th century," he said. The machine took 15 minutes to produce images -- modern scanners take two to three minutes -- but it allowed him to start operating on skull fractures.
In January 2014, the Syrian American Medical Society, which was supporting one of the field hospitals, hired him and began to help with equipment. A few months later, he conducted his first brain surgery, extracting skull fragments from a patient's brain, with a senior surgeon observing.
He had planned to stay only a few months, but put off leaving. "I had to stay," he said. "It was getting worse: more injuries, more doctors leaving." Crossing back into Turkey along smuggling routes also became dangerous. "I was procrastinating," he said. "I am not a very risky person."
But as the Syrian government closed its grip on the city, Aleppo became one of the most dangerous war zones on Earth, and hospitals and medical clinics became frequent targets of government bombs. He lived and worked in three field hospitals, operating underground for two years.
The medical staff learned the rhythm of the bombing -- jets and helicopters began at 9 a.m. and eased off at nightfall -- and would venture upstairs for an hour to eat, before shelling from nearby government posts sent them back underground.
For a few months there was a cease-fire and he found respite visiting Syrian friends in the countryside outside Aleppo. He even got engaged, after a friend introduced him to Joud, a 23-year-old social worker who worked in the administration of a charity.
As the bombing intensified, casualties rose. A month after their engagement in 2016, Joud was killed in a bombing on her way home from work. Dr. Ibrahim withdrew into himself for a few days in grief and anger. "I did not feel like talking to anyone." Soon, though, he returned to work. "Other people lost more than me," he said.
The hospital was swamped by the wounded in the last months of the siege. "I could not go out of the hospital for a few minutes, because any second a shell might fall on us," he said. "I was someone else. Not sleeping. Not walking. Like you are in a prison and working in a prison."
The hardest day was when he was forced to operate on the floor of the intensive care unit, as the beds and operating rooms were all occupied. "The hospital was very crowded -- I needed to do surgery immediately," he said.
The patient was comatose with a brain injury and one of his pupils dilated, an indication of life-threatening pressure from bleeding on the brain. "Every minute counts," Dr. Ibrahim said. "I drilled a small hole and the patient stabilized."
He never knew the man's name, but the patient visited him two months later for a checkup. "I was standing like stone," Dr. Ibrahim recalled. "I did not expect him to survive."
In December 2016, after Turkey and Russia negotiated an end to the siege of Aleppo, Dr. Ibrahim helped evacuate 50 patients from the hospital and then joined doctors and civilians in the first of a convoy of buses carrying the last survivors.
"We left Aleppo destroyed. It was not the Aleppo that we knew," he said. "Some people burned their houses, because they knew they would not come back." He used a medical term to describe his own feelings as he left the hospital and his instruments behind: "Flatline."
He ended up in Idlib, the last opposition-controlled province in northwestern Syria, along with several million displaced Syrians, and after a few months began working in a provincial hospital.
But the Syrian government, intent on reasserting its control throughout the country, began an offensive against Idlib this spring. The daily bombing brought back all the horrors of Aleppo, and once again he began operating underground.
His options were scant, as he told The New York Times in May: become a refugee or return to Egypt, where he could be prosecuted for traveling to Syria to work with the rebels.
Then medical colleagues threw him a lifeline, helping arrange his entry into Turkey, where a professor in neurosurgery accepted him on a three-month observer program at Firat University in Elazig.
One month after escaping the war, he says he feels disconnected and depressed, living in a strange town where he doesn't speak the language. Refocusing on his career, he says he is determined to return to war surgery.
"I have more to do, I am still young, I have energy," he said. "It's the start of my life."

End the war, stop forcing US troops to prop up pedophile culture in Afghanistan

Texto completo: This Monday marked the 18th anniversary of U.S. troops’ arrival in Afghanistan after 9/11. I deployed there a decade later.
As Marines, we rarely discussed why we were there, except for being hell-bent on taking the fight to the Taliban, which we did. And militarily, we won, disrupting enemy supply routes and daring them to come out and fight. Outgunned, they resorted to planting IEDs on trails and roads, sniping at us from a distance, or using explosive-laden vehicles.
But we didn't win in every sense of the word. For example, we'd capture bomb makers and hold them the maximum time allowed before being forced by the rules of engagement to give them to the Afghan Police, who would promptly release them back into the population to make more bombs to kill Marines. Whether it was family connections, local influence, or “missing” evidence, the corruption involved in this process was obvious.
After catching the same bomb makers over and over, we couldn’t tell who our real friends were. The Afghan national government might have claimed to be with us, but the local police — many with familial ties to the Taliban — and the Afghan National Army often didn’t get the memo.
During my second deployment, the Taliban started forcing children to plant bombs, with the unavoidable result required to stop American deaths: children sometimes died at the hands of U.S. forces, at the cost of our own seared consciences.
But the assault on American troops’ morality didn’t end there. We were also required to work alongside “allied” police chiefs whose tribal culture allowed them to “own” boys as young as eight, whom they dressed as females and forcibly, repeatedly, sodomized.
We were strictly forbidden to intervene. Don't believe me? Believe the New York Times:
“Former Special Forces officer, Capt. Dan Quinn, who beat up an Afghan commander for keeping a boy chained to his bed as a sex slave, said…he was relieved of command as a result...’We were putting people into power who did things worse than the Taliban,’ said Quinn… SFC Charles Martland, a highly decorated Green Beret, was forced out of the military after beating up an Afghan local police commander who was a child rapist. Martland became incensed after the Afghan commander abducted the boy, raped him, then beat up the boy’s mother when she tried to rescue him.”
The payback came when one of these boys — seeing us as allies of his rapist slave master — murdered three Marines. One of those Marines’ fathers told the Times, “As far as the young boys are concerned, the Marines are allowing (child rape) to happen, so they’re guilty by association. They don’t know our Marines are sick to their stomachs.”
I certainly was. I don’t speak lightly of these and other tragedies I witnessed.
Yet today, eight years after leaving Afghanistan, the region where I served has returned to Taliban control. And the questions remain: What is our end goal there? What’s our definition of victory?
Our military objectives were achieved long ago: al Qaeda in Afghanistan is defeated. Bin Laden is dead.
But given the glaringly obvious futility of expecting U.S. troops to “democratize” or “westernize” Afghani culture and morality, do politicians in Washington intend to keep American troops there forever?
I've joined other Afghanistan veterans at BringOurTroopsHome.US, and you can help by signing our petition. It’s time we stop deploying American troops to places where it's not just their lives and limbs that are at risk, but also their mental health and moral consciences, the scarred collateral casualties of endless wars propping up institutions that don’t reflect our values.

Texto completo: Our guide to the city's best classical music and opera happening this weekend and in the week ahead.
BASEL CHAMBER ORCHESTRA at the 92nd Street Y (Oct. 16, 7:30 p.m.). Piotr Anderszewski joins this Swiss ensemble for Mozart's Piano Concertos Nos. 12 and 17, paired respectively with Schubert's Symphony No. 5 and Heinz Holliger's "Meta Arca," in its United States premiere. Also this weekend at the Y (Sunday at 3 p.m.), Andras Schiff makes a rare joint appearance with his wife, the violinist Yuuko Shiokawa, for four violin sonatas by Mozart.
212-415-5500, 92y.org
'DESIRE' at Miller Theater (Oct. 16-17, 8 p.m.). Missy Mazzoli's "Proving Up" was the first piece commissioned as part of Miller's foray into the world of contemporary chamber opera; Hannah Lash's "Desire" is the second. It's performed by the JACK Quartet and three singers: Kirsten Sollek, Daniel Moody and Christopher Dylan Herbert. Cori Ellison, who assisted Lash with the libretto, is the dramaturge, while Rachel Dickstein directs.
212-854-7799, millertheatre.com
DOVER QUARTET AND EMANUEL AX at Zankel Hall (Oct. 15, 7:30 p.m.). Later in the month this outstanding young foursome has a very fine recording of the Schumann quartets coming out on the Azica label, and there's Schumann in this concert, too, albeit the Piano Quintet. Also on the bill are Britten's String Quartet No. 1 and Brahms's String Quartet No. 3.

BARBARA HANNIGAN at the Park Avenue Armory (Oct. 15 and 17, 7:30 p.m.). If we could just hear more of Hannigan, one of the great sopranos of our time, now making waves as a conductor, too. Her only scheduled New York appearances of the season feature music by John Zorn, including "Pandora" with the JACK Quartet and "Jumalatteret" with the pianist Stephen Gosling, on Tuesday; and by Schoenberg, namely his String Quartet No. 2 with the Emerson String Quartet, on Thursday.
212-616-3930, armoryonpark.org
MOMENTA FESTIVAL at the Americas Society (Oct. 15-16, 7 p.m.; through Oct. 19). Celebrating its 15th season this year, the Momenta Quartet presents its fifth annual festival, in which each of the players curates a free concert. On Tuesday there's music by Mario Davidovsky, Julian Carrillo, Alvin Singleton and Matthew Greenbaum; on Wednesday, Roberto Sierra, Harry Partch, Mario Lavista, Erwin Schulhoff and Gyorgy Ligeti. The festival continues on Oct. 18 and 19 at the Tenri Cultural Institute.

PHILADELPHIA ORCHESTRA at Carnegie Hall (Oct. 15, 8 p.m.). Yannick Nézet-Séguin has a Perspectives series this year. It's an honor that some artists have treated as an opportunity for experimentation; instead, he is mostly wasting it on one of this season's two cycles of the Beethoven symphonies, which the orchestra will return to perform at Carnegie starting in March. No Beethoven in this opening concert, though, rather Strauss's "Eine Alpensinfonie," Valerie Coleman's "Umoja" and Bartok's Piano Concerto No. 3. Hélène Grimaud is at the keyboard.
212-247-7800, carnegiehall.org
DANIIL TRIFONOV AND SERGEI BABAYAN at Carnegie Hall (Oct. 16, 8 p.m.). Trifonov and his teacher have made an endearing double act in their performances together, but my colleague James R. Oestreich wrote in a review of their Carnegie recital last year that they also have a "firepower" that is "rare among piano duos." Here they play Schumann, Ravel, Rachmaninoff and Prokofiev, in a transcription of "Romeo and Juliet" by Babayan himself. Pianophiles should note, too, that the next night at Carnegie (Thursday at 8 p.m.) the wonderful Beatrice Rana performs two of Bach's keyboard concertos with the Orchestra of St. Luke's.

Texto completo: The impeachment inquiry into President Trump over his pressure on Ukraine to conduct an investigation into a political rival, former vice president Joe Biden, is moving rapidly, and developments are coming to light at all hours. Here's a summary of what you might have missed, and what's expected to happen next.
What happened Wednesday and overnight:
■ Former vice president Joe Biden for the first time explicitly called for Trump to be impeached, going beyond his previous stance of supporting an inquiry if Trump does not cooperate with House Democrats.
“Trump has violated his oath of office, betrayed his nation, and committed impeachable acts," Biden said in New Hampshire. Read the full report from the Globe's Laura Krantz and James Pindell.
■ CBS News has obtained what it says is the full content of a memo written by the whistle-blower after discussing Trump's Ukraine call with an administration official.
“In the official's view, the President had clearly committed a criminal act by urging a foreign power to investigate a U.S. person for the purposes of advancing his own reelection bid in 2020," the whistle-blower wrote. Read the full memo.
■ In remarks to reporters in Kyiv, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine says his country will "happily" investigate whether Ukrainians interfered in the 2016 US elections. He also said there was “no blackmail" in his call with Trump.
What's happening next:
■ President Trump is holding a pair of campaign rallies over the next two days, one on Thursday in Minneapolis and another Friday in Lake Charles, La.
■ More subpoenas are expected to be issued Thursday after a break for Yom Kippur, according to the New York Times.
■ It remains unclear whether officials involved in the Ukraine scandal will speak to congressional investigators in the wake of the administration's declaration that it would not cooperate. Lev Parnas, an ally of Rudy Giuliani, is scheduled to be deposed today.
■ House Democrats are expecting former US ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch to testify as planned Friday, despite the White House decision to stop cooperating with the impeachment inquiry, according to the Washington Post.

Trump has little room to criticize the NBA for China panders

Texto completo: President Trump is right. NBA head coaches Steve Kerr and Gregg Popovich are massive cowards for dodging easy questions this week about the NBA siding with communist China against the Hong Kong protesters.
Trump also has little room to criticize anyone else on the issue of sucking up to the communist Chinese.
"I watch this guy Steve Kerr," the president said this week, referring to the Golden State Warriors head coach. "And he was like a little boy, he was so scared to be even answering the question."
"He couldn't answer the question," Trump added. "He was shaking 'Oh, I don't know, I don't know.' He didn't know how to answer the question. And yet he'll talk about the United States very badly.”
The president then turned to Popovich's weaselly response to questions about China and Hong Kong, saying the San Antonio Spurs head coach at least "didn't look quite as scared."
The president also criticized the NBA as a whole, saying, "I watch the way that Kerr, Popovich, and some of the others were pandering to China and yet to our own country, they don't, it's like they don't respect it.”
For the record, this is what Kerr said this week about the NBA/China debacle:
It’s a really bizarre international story. A lot of us don’t know what to make of it. It’s something I’m reading about, just like everybody is, but I’m not going to comment further than that. What I’ve found is that it’s easy to speak on issues that I’m passionate about that I feel like I’m well-versed on and I’ve found that it makes the most sense to stick to topics that fall in that category. So I try to keep my comments to those things and so it’s not difficult. It’s more I’m just trying to learn. My brother-in-law is actually a Chinese history professor and I emailed him today to tell me what I should be learning about all this and what’s happening and so I’m trying to learn just like everybody else.
Here is Popovich’s bizarre, nonsensical, and winding anti-Trump answer to a simple question about the NBA acquiescing to communist China:
I guess I can go at it this way. [NBA commissioner Adam Silver] is a very progressive leader. We all remember how he handled the situation with the former owner of the Clippers. It made everybody proud because it was the right thing to do. A couple of years ago, I was walking the streets in New York City during the gay pride parade. I turned around and here comes a float, and Adam is standing on a float with a big sign in support of LGBTQ. And I felt great again, just like I did with the Clipper deal. He came out strongly for freedom of speech. I felt great again. He's been a heck of a leader in that respect and very courageous. Then you compare it to what we've had to live through the past three years, it's a big difference. A big gap there, leadership-wise and courage-wise. It wasn't easy for him to say. He said that in an environment fraught with possible economic peril. But he sided with the principles that we all hold dearly, or most of us did until the last three years. I'm thrilled with what he said. The courage and leadership displayed is off the charts by comparison.
Trump is not wrong when he says these are cowardly responses to very easy questions. The Communist Party of China, which is responsible for the murder of an estimated 45 million people and has another 3 million currently imprisoned in concentration camps, is the bad guy; Hong Kong is the good guy. This is not difficult.
Trump's message, however, would probably have a lot more punch to it were it not for the fact he was the one who tweeted last week, “Congratulations to President Xi and the Chinese people on the 70th Anniversary of the People’s Republic of China!”
Tweet
If we want to talk about “pandering to China,” let’s talk about the president of the United States hailing the 70th anniversary of the birth of its murderous communist regime. Kerr and Popovich’s nonanswers this week are acts of cowardice, certainly, but Trump’s tweet was an act of pro-China sycophancy, no different from the New York Times' glowing 1976 obituary for Chairman Mao Zedong, after whom Chinese President Xi Jinping styles himself, or former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg wrongly (and knowingly) insisting that Xi is not a dictator. Yes, bureaucratic American lickspittles have in the past tripped over themselves to congratulate China on the start of its despotic regime. But that is not really a defense of Trump, who ran on a platform promising to make American foreign policy tough and, dare I say, great again, now is it?
Further, though they are cowards, nothing Kerr and Popovich have said or done compares to the damage caused by the president’s pro-anniversary message. He is the president of the United States, after all, and he is continuing the sorry tradition of American leaders legitimizing the violent takeover of China by a mass-murdering government.
It would be nice if we had a commander in chief who could argue from a position of authority that fellow Americans should never pander to despotic regimes. But that isn't the president that we have.

Behind Amazon’s abrupt change in its film strategy

Texto completo: Los Angeles • “The Aeronauts,” an adventure film about swashbuckling 19th-century hot-air balloonists, was built for the big screen. Led by an Oscar winner, Eddie Redmayne, and a “Star Wars” star, Felicity Jones, it has real cinematic sweep, with sequences that take place miles above sea level. In May, Amazon Studios announced that the movie would play exclusively on IMAX screens for a one-week engagement before “a full theatrical run.”
“We look forward to giving our customers an unforgettable theatrical experience high above the clouds,” Jennifer Salke, the head of Amazon Studios, said in a statement at the time.
Two months later, Amazon scrapped the IMAX engagement and shrank the theatrical release. Under the new plan, “The Aeronauts” would have a two-week run in a small number of theaters before becoming available for streaming on Amazon Prime Video, which is available to more than 100 million Amazon Prime subscribers.
The film’s director, Tom Harper, was disappointed by the move. “It’s not how it’s intended to be seen,” he said in an interview with The New York Times at the Toronto International Film Festival last month, where a showing of “The Aeronauts” received a standing ovation. “But it’s a changing world, and I want people to see the movie. If it were up to me, I’d tell them to see it in the theaters.”
The about-face also stunned the movie industry, partly because Amazon had been a friend to old Hollywood, more willing than the other tech giants to sign on for lengthy theatrical releases. Films from Amazon that spent months in theaters have included the two-time Oscar-winner “Manchester by the Sea,” the acclaimed 2017 comedy “The Big Sick” and this summer’s “Late Night.”
With the change in plan for “The Aeronauts,” Amazon was behaving more like its streaming rival Netflix, which has favored delivering movies to its subscribers quickly, rather than giving them long theatrical runs. And the abruptness of the shift contributed to questions that have been swirling among entertainment industry people about how the company’s entertainment unit, Amazon Studios, handles films.
The Amazon Studios television arm has distinguished itself with two Emmy-winning series, “Fleabag” and “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel.” Under Salke, a former president of entertainment at NBC who took charge in 2018, it has also struck a TV deals with name writer-producer-directors like Jordan Peele and Barry Jenkins, as well as “Fleabag” creator Phoebe Waller-Bridge. The awards and prominent production deals have overshadowed Amazon’s film division to some degree.
“On the film side, I still think they are figuring out what they want to be,” said Richard Greenfield, a co-founder of the LightShed Partners research firm.
Salke, 55, did not inherit a cinematic gold mine when she replaced Roy Price, who was ousted after an allegation of sexual harassment. Before she stepped in, the film division had been on a losing streak, with box-office flops from A-list directors like Richard Linklater and Todd Haynes.
In January, Salke attended the Sundance Film Festival for the first time as the Amazon Studios head — and the company went on a spree, shelling out significant sums for to several films, including $14 million for “Brittany Runs a Marathon,” a low-key, feel-good comedy now in theaters; another $14 million for “The Report,” a government cover-up drama starring Annette Bening and Adam Driver that will have a limited release in November; and $13 million more for the domestic rights to “Late Night,” a comedy written by Mindy Kaling and starring Kaling as a neophyte TV writer and Emma Thompson in the role of an imperious talk show host.
With “Late Night,” Amazon hoped to repeat its success with “The Big Sick,” a Sundance pickup that grossed more than $56 million at the box office. At the height of its run, “Late Night” played on 2,200 screens across the country this summer.
Despite largely positive reviews and a $32 million marketing budget, audiences stayed away, and “Late Night” generated $15.4 million in domestic box office. The trade press pounced. IndieWire called the release “a disaster.” Variety said Amazon had been “thrown off-balance.”
Salke called the coverage “frustrating.” She also defended the “Late Night” acquisition, saying it has been streamed on Amazon Prime Video more than any other Amazon original film since it appeared on the service Sept. 6. She would not reveal specific figures.
When “Late Night” was still in theaters, Amazon parted ways with the company’s head of film marketing and distribution, Bob Berney, a Hollywood veteran whose four-year contract had expired. At roughly the same time, Amazon also changed course on “The Aeronauts,” a film with a budget of roughly $40 million that it had developed in-house.
Along with her three co-heads of motion pictures — Ted Hope, Matt Newman and Julie Rapaport — Salke called the makers of “The Aeronauts” and told them that, instead of the exclusive IMAX engagement and extensive theatrical release in the United States, the film would open Dec. 6 at a limited number of theaters and start streaming Dec. 20. (Entertainment One, known as eOne, will distribute the film in Britain for a full theatrical run, including IMAX theaters.)
“With the accessibility of a movie like ‘The Aeronauts,’ we think we can make a bigger event out of it on Prime,” Salke said.
The decision to favor small-screen viewing over the cinematic experience came at a time when theatrical distribution has become less of a sure thing. Moviegoers seem reluctant to go to theaters for films that do not belong to larger franchises or have a superhero or two in them, and box office revenue for the summer was down 2%, compared with 2018.
“Given the state of the business, nobody is relishing the idea of having a movie out in theaters that, no matter what, the industry wants to talk about the underperformance of those movies,” Salke said.
But Amazon decided on the cinematic route for “Brittany Runs a Marathon,” a film that opened in five theaters in August and has played on more than 1,000 screens. So far, it has generated a modest $6.6 million, according to the website Box Office Mojo. Amazon has decided on a similar strategy for “Honey Boy,” which stars Shia LaBeouf and has received strong early reviews, with a plan to open it in a few theaters Nov. 8 before rolling it out across the country.
The differing strategies for “The Aeronauts” and the two smaller films go against conventional Hollywood wisdom, which holds that a spectacle like “The Aeronauts” should have a shot at big-screen success, while more intimate films are often suited for the direct-to-consumer approach.
Todd Black, an independent producer who has two films set up at Amazon, including a movie written by Aaron Sorkin about Lucille Ball, said he was rooting for Salke and her film team. “They are learning and being more definitive about what they can and can’t do, will and won’t do,” he said. “But I feel like they need some help and they need a mission statement.”
Salke sounded confident in her vision, saying, “My mission is clear. The details of it are in progress.”
And what is the mission?
“The mission is to align the movie side to the same values of trying to get premium content to the global consumer,” she said. “That’s what pays the bills. I will have streaming movies that I will deliver at a regular cadence to my customers globally.”
Starting in 2020, she added, those movies — as many as 30 a year — will come from three categories: young adult films, including a lesbian romance from the director Jennifer Kent; dark-themed thrillers from Blumhouse Productions, the company behind “Paranormal Activity” and “Get Out”; and films Salke once described as “sexy date-night movies,” now called provocative dramas, from collaborators like Nicole Kidman and her Blossom Films production house.
“I’m fully confident in the strategy,” Salke said. “I know what a global marketing campaign can do with a television series. I know what those numbers are.”
Salke has yet to replace Berney, the executive who, before joining Amazon, ran the marketing campaigns for “Pan’s Labyrinth” and “The Passion of the Christ.” There seems to be little urgency at the company to find a new marketing and distribution executive.
Three people familiar with Amazon said the company had become something of an also-ran among those looking to change jobs in Hollywood. For one thing, the flip-flop on the release of “The Aeronauts” suggests a muddled vision for the film division’s future.
Of less concern but still an issue is the lack of perks the famously frugal company offers. For example, Amazon refuses to pay for first-class air travel and, though the stock options are generous, the people added, the salaries are on the low side. Even the parking lot in Culver City is a problem. Those who do not arrive early are often stuck parking at the nearby Trader Joe’s.
Black, the independent producer, said the film community should be patient. “They know they made some mistakes and everyone has them under a microscope,” he said. “No one should lose sight that they have a huge checkbook.”

Texto completo: The reporter who helped bring down Harvey Weinstein secured an on-the-record interview with one of the former "Today" host's accusers.
For more than 20 years, Matt Lauer was a star anchor of NBC's most profitable franchise, "Today." His downfall came in November 2017 when the network fired him after receiving a complaint of sexual misconduct against him. The accusation was soon followed by others.
Now, the circumstances of that firing have resurfaced in a book by the investigative journalist Ronan Farrow that contains new details from Mr. Lauer's primary accuser, including her account of a rape. The book, "Catch and Kill," is expected to be released on Tuesday.
The accuser provided an account of her interactions with Mr. Lauer to The New York Times nearly two years ago, but said she was not willing to go public with her story at the time. On Wednesday, Variety reported that Mr. Farrow had secured an on-the-record interview with the woman, Brooke Nevils, who allowed the author to name her.
Ms. Nevils gave Mr. Farrow a detailed description of an encounter with Mr. Lauer, which took place when the network was covering the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia. Mr. Lauer anally raped Ms. Nevils, she told Mr. Farrow.
Mr. Lauer denied the allegation in a letter provided by his lawyer on Wednesday.
"In a new book, it is alleged that an extramarital, but consensual, sexual encounter I have previously admitted having was in fact an assault," Mr. Lauer wrote. "It is categorically false, ignores the facts and defies common sense. I had an extramarital affair with Brooke Nevils in 2014. It began when she came to my hotel room very late one night in Sochi, Russia. We engaged in a variety of sexual acts. We performed oral sex on each other, we had vaginal sex, and we had anal sex. Each act was mutual and completely consensual."
A lawyer for Ms. Nevils declined to comment. Little, Brown, the publisher of "Catch and Kill," had no comment.
Before he left for The New Yorker, Mr. Farrow was a reporter at NBC News, working as a contributor to MSNBC and, for a time, as a correspondent on "Today," with a segment called "Undercover With Ronan Farrow." At the time of his departure from the network in August 2017, he was pursuing allegations of sexual misconduct against the film mogul Harvey Weinstein. Mr. Farrow and executives at NBC News disagreed bitterly over whether or not his reporting was ready for broadcast, and their working relationship came to an end.
A news producer who worked with Mr. Farrow at NBC, Rich McHugh, accused the network of impeding Mr. Farrow's reporting on Mr. Weinstein in an interview with The Times last year. He called the interference "a massive breach of journalistic integrity."
NBC News disagreed. In an email to the staff, the NBC News chairman Andrew Lack said the network "had nothing yet fit to broadcast." He added, "We spent eight months pursuing the story, but at the end of that time, NBC News -- like many others before us -- still did not have a single victim or witness willing to go on the record."
In "Catch and Kill," Mr. Farrow has set his sights on Mr. Lack and the NBC News president Noah Oppenheim. The book includes a detailed account of the pushback Mr. Farrow said he had received from the news division's executives, and his reporting on Mr. Lauer could have reverberations at the network. Up until now, Mr. Farrow had been publicly silent on his disagreements with the network.
At the time of Mr. Lauer's firing, NBC News executives said they had not been aware of the host's sexual misconduct until the first accuser filed a complaint. In a memo to the staff on Nov. 29, 2017, Mr. Lack wrote: "While it is the first complaint about his behavior in the over 20 years he's been at NBC News, we were also presented with reason to believe this may not have been an isolated incident."
The network started an inquiry. Unlike previous investigations of sexual misconduct involving employees at media companies like NPR and Fox News, which relied on the work of outside law firms, NBC used its own counsel to look into the question of whether or not its executives were aware of Mr. Lauer's behavior before any complaint was lodged against him.
Five months after the firing, the NBCUniversal legal team filed a report clearing NBC News management.
"We found no evidence indicating that any NBC News or 'Today' show leadership, News H.R. or others in positions of authority in the News Division received any complaints about Lauer's workplace behavior prior to Nov. 27, 2017," the report concluded.
Mr. Farrow's book may put the legal team's finding under scrutiny. He reports that Ms. Nevils, the accuser, told many people at NBC, including her superiors, about Mr. Lauer's conduct long before he was fired.
NBC News responded to Mr. Farrow's reporting with a statement on Wednesday. "Matt Lauer's conduct was appalling, horrific and reprehensible, as we said at the time," the statement said. "That's why he was fired within 24 hours of us first learning of the complaint. Our hearts break again for our colleague."
Mr. Lauer became part of an ignominious cohort of media figures felled by sexual misconduct allegations in 2017 and 2018, a group that included Mr. Weinstein, the CBS anchor Charlie Rose and the CBS chairman and president Leslie Moonves.
Along with Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey of The Times, Mr. Farrow was one of the journalists whose investigative reporting, much of which turned up accusations against Mr. Weinstein and Mr. Moonves, advanced the #MeToo movement. The revelations brought about a nationwide reckoning on workplace behavior and a reconsideration of the everyday abuses committed by men in positions of power.
Ms. Kantor, Ms. Twohey and Mr. Farrow were prominent among the group of reporters awarded the 2018 Pulitzer Prize in public service. A theme of their work concerned the so-called enablers who stood by as abuses took place. With the imminent arrival of Mr. Farrow's "Catch and Kill," a question coming again to the fore is whether or not that group includes top executives at NBC and NBC News.
On Wednesday afternoon, Mr. Lack sent a memo to his staff defending the network's handling of Mr. Lauer, as well as its work with Mr. Farrow. The memo, which was obtained by The Times, said that "any suggestion" that NBC News executives had known about Mr. Lauer's behavior before the accusation or tried to cover it up "is absolutely false and offensive."
"Following Lauer's firing," Mr. Lack added, "NBCU's legal team did an exhaustive investigation of available records and conducted dozens of interviews of past and present staff. They uncovered no claims or settlements associated with allegations of inappropriate conduct by Lauer before he was fired."
Mr. Lack also took issue with Mr. Farrow's contention that NBC News had gotten in the way of his investigation of Mr. Weinstein, saying that, in the book, the reporter "uses a variety of tactics to paint a fundamentally untrue picture."
The dispute between the reporter and the network continued into the evening, when a representative for Mr. Farrow put out a statement saying NBC executives had made efforts "to thwart" his reporting.
"The claims by NBC's senior management about Ronan Farrow's reporting are simply not true, as his book will methodically demonstrate," the statement said.

Texto completo: The people who allegedly hectored Celtics center Enes Kanter outside a mosque over his political opposition to Turkey's president didn't commit a crime, Cambridge police have determined.
In a statement Tuesday, police announced their findings in their review of the bizarre incident Friday afternoon outside the Islamic Society of Boston on Prospect Street in Cambridge.
The statement said police have “conducted a preliminary investigation into a report of threats and harassment based on" the encounter.
“Following this investigation, which included conversations with Mr. Kanter and other involved parties, it has been determined that no criminal activity occurred and that the other individuals featured in a video posted online were exercising their constitutionally protected right to free speech," the statement said. “Mr. Kanter has been advised of the steps that would be necessary to pursue a civil restraining order against the other parties, if he elects to pursue one."
Cops said anyone “with any additional information information related to this incident is asked to call the Cambridge Police at 617-349-3300. Those who wish to submit tips anonymously via phone, email, and text message, should visit www.CambridgePolice.org/Tips."
The statement came days after Kanter flagged the incident on social media, tweeting out a video that showed him and teammate Tacko Fall outside the mosque, which is a short walk from Inman Square. In the video, at least two men can be seen addressing Kanter. One of them holds a cellphone.
Kanter, who is expected to be Boston's starting center this season, is a vocal critic of Turkey's leader, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, previously calling him “the Hitler of our century." Erdogan has been accused of increasingly authoritarian tendencies. In the Friday video, Kanter indicates the two men are his fellow countrymen who support Erdogan.
“They're actually starting a fight outside of a mosque, pro-Erdogan people," Kanter says in the clip.
Later, in a phone interview with the Globe, Kanter said he had never seen the men before and that they cursed at him, called him “traitor," indicated that he should not be here, and made an obscene gesture at him. He said that when he and Fall, a 7-foot-7 rookie, left Friday's prayer service, the men were waiting for him outside. There, the men caused a scene, yelling and screaming at him, Kanter said.
“I told you America, this is crazy," Kanter says in the video.
Kanter told the Globe he has tried to stand up “for human rights, democracy, and freedom" and to bring awareness of “what's really going on in Turkey."
“I'm not going to back down," he said.
He called the harassment unacceptable and said he was shocked by the incident.
“It's a mosque, it's a house of God, this shouldn't happen," he said.
Cambridge police said Tuesday that no one should feel intimidated at a house of worship.
“The Cambridge Police recognizes that places of worship should be places where all can congregate with peace of mind and without fear," cops said. “No group or individual should ever suffer from bias, discrimination or hate. If any member of the community does believe that they have been threatened or harassed due to their faith, they are strongly encouraged to contact the police or organizations like the Anti-Defamation League. We remain committed to supporting and protecting all places of worship, and will continue to closely work with faith leaders, their staff, and those who attend their places of worship."

Texto completo: The Competitive Enterprise Institute has published a new paper, "Wrong Again: 50 Years of Failed Eco-pocalyptic Predictions." Keep in mind that many of the grossly wrong environmentalist predictions were made by respected scientists and government officials. My question for you is: If you were around at the time, how many government restrictions and taxes would you have urged to avoid the predicted calamity?
As reported in The New York Times (Aug. 1969) Stanford University biologist Dr. Paul Ehrlich warned: "The trouble with almost all environmental problems is that by the time we have enough evidence to convince people, you’re dead. We must realize that unless we’re extremely lucky, everybody will disappear in a cloud of blue steam in 20 years."
In 2000, Dr. David Viner, a senior research scientist at University of East Anglia’s climate research unit, predicted that in a few years winter snowfall would become "a very rare and exciting event. Children just aren’t going to know what snow is." In 2004, the U.S. Pentagon warned President George W. Bush that major European cities would be beneath rising seas. Britain will be plunged into a Siberian climate by 2020. In 2008, Al Gore predicted that the polar ice cap would be gone in a mere 10 years. A U.S. Department of Energy study led by the U.S. Navy predicted the Arctic Ocean would experience an ice-free summer by 2016.
In May 2014, French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius declared during a joint appearance with Secretary of State John Kerry that "we have 500 days to avoid climate chaos."
Peter Gunter, professor at North Texas State University, predicted in the spring 1970 issue of The Living Wilderness: "Demographers agree almost unanimously on the following grim timetable: by 1975 widespread famines will begin in India; these will spread by 1990 to include all of India, Pakistan, China and the Near East, Africa. By the year 2000, or conceivably sooner, South and Central America will exist under famine conditions. ... By the year 2000, thirty years from now, the entire world, with the exception of Western Europe, North America, and Australia, will be in famine."
Ecologist Kenneth Watt’s 1970 prediction was, "If present trends continue, the world will be about four degrees colder for the global mean temperature in 1990, but eleven degrees colder in the year 2000." He added, "This is about twice what it would take to put us into an Ice Age."
Mark J. Perry, scholar at the American Enterprise Institute and professor of economics and finance at the University of Michigan’s Flint campus, cites 18 spectacularly wrong predictions made around the time of first Earth Day in 1970. This time it’s not about weather. Harrison Brown, a scientist at the National Academy of Sciences, published a chart in Scientific American that looked at metal reserves and estimated that humanity would run out of copper shortly after 2000. Lead, zinc, tin, gold and silver would be gone before 1990. Kenneth Watt said, "By the year 2000, if present trends continue, we will be using up crude oil at such a rate ... that there won’t be any more crude oil."
There were grossly wild predictions well before the first Earth Day, too. In 1939, the U.S. Department of the Interior predicted that American oil supplies would last for only another 13 years. In 1949, the secretary of the interior said the end of U.S. oil supplies was in sight. Having learned nothing from its earlier erroneous energy claims, in 1974, the U.S. Geological Survey said that the U.S. had only a 10-year supply of natural gas. However, the U.S. Energy Information Administration estimated that as of Jan. 1, 2017, there were about 2,459 trillion cubic feet of dry natural gas in the United States. That’s enough to last us for nearly a century. The United States is the largest producer of natural gas worldwide.
Today’s wild predictions about climate doom are likely to be just as true as yesteryear’s. The major difference is today’s Americans are far more gullible and more likely to spend trillions fighting global warming. And the only result is that we’ll be much poorer and less free.

What's next for the House Democrats now that the White House is stonewalling the impeachment inquiry?

Texto completo: The White House has vowed to halt cooperation with what it calls an “illegitimate" House impeachment inquiry, stonewalling the House's efforts to look into the Trump-Ukraine scandal.
What's next?
Experts see several possibilities. Either the Democratic-dominated House could go to court and try to force the White House to give up the information. Or the House could forge onward with investigating and impeaching controversial, divisive Republican President Trump. Or it could do both.
The path forward for the House was unclear Wednesday.
CNN reported that a growing number of Democrats felt that the lack of cooperation by the White House would bolster rather than hurt their case.
US Representative Gerry Connolly, a Virginia Democrat, said the transcript, whistle-blower complaint, and text messages that have already been publicly released as the scandal has rocked Washington are “so compelling" and “so damning" they tell the “complete story."
“You know what you need to know from the documents that we already have," he said. “It is why I think the stonewalling is counterproductive and ultimately futile. There are going to be more people coming forward irrespective of WH stonewalling. All it does is persuade the public . . . [the president] is resisting for a reason."
House Democratic leaders are pushing to complete articles of impeachment by the end of next month, Bloomberg News reports.
The investigation can continue without cooperation from the White House, Chuck Rosenberg, former US attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, said on MSNBC-TV's “Morning Joe" program.
He said investigators can follow other threads, finding “other places to go to get information," including text messages and testimony from witnesses the White House can't muzzle.
“It doesn't mean the investigation comes to a dead halt," he said.
Stephen Vladeck, a professor at the University of Texas School of Law, said on NPR's “Alll Things Considered," “Obviously, the Democrats can try to round up evidence and information . . . from other places, from other individuals, from folks who are not, you know — would not comply with a White House directive not to testify."
The House could also go to court, where precedents set in a 1974 US Supreme Court case at the time of the Nixon impeachment inquiry could help it pry loose the information, legal experts said.
But House leaders have said they do not want to get bogged down in a long legal fight.
House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, who is leading the Trump-Ukraine probe, has said Democrats will "have to decide whether to litigate, or how to litigate."
“We're not fooling around here," Schiff said last week. “We don't want this to drag on months and months and months, which appears to be the administration's strategy."
The House has another card to play. It could ultimately draw up an article of impeachment against the president for obstruction.
“The White House should be warned that continued efforts to hide the truth of the president's abuse of power from the American people will be regarded as further evidence of obstruction," House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a statement. “Mr. President, you are not above the law. You will be held accountable."
Schiff tweeted that Trump's refusal to cooperate with the inquiry signals an attitude that "the president is above the law."
"The Constitution says otherwise," he said.
Frank Bowman, a professor at the University of Missouri School of Law who is the author of “High Crimes and Misdemeanors: A History of Impeachment for the Age of Trump," said, “A refusal to provide material requested by the House in an impeachment inquiry is itself an impeachable offense. That was certainly the conclusion of the Nixon Judiciary Committee, which approved as its third article of impeachment the charge that Nixon had unjustifiably refused to respond to Committee subpoenas."
“Of course, this is a debatable point. Nixon's Republican defenders resisted the idea and the third article passed the committee by the narrowest margin of the three. But I personally think the principle unassailable. If a president can refuse to provide information that, if provided, would form the basis of impeachment, but suffer no consequence, then impeachment becomes a toothless tiger, a useless constitutional appendage," Bowman said in an e-mail.

Texto completo: How can two actors play seven men, a mother, a stepmother, a daughter, a huntsman, a servant, a prince and a talking magic mirror? If the actors are Joy Dolo and Dean Holt, no problem. Before “Snow White,” which the Children’s Theater Company opened over the weekend, they’ve done this sort of thing before: in last spring’s “The Hobbit,” a play with five actors, a boatload of characters and armies of elves, dwarves and goblins. (There Dolo played several characters and Holt only one, but if they had needed Holt to take on a few dozen more, he could have.)
Along with Blackout Improv co-founder Dolo and longtime CTC company member Holt, “Snow White” and “The Hobbit” have something else in common: British playwright and director Greg Banks, who shines at adapting big stories for small casts. His other CTC productions include “Huck Finn” (three actors), “Pinocchio” (four) and “The Jungle Book” (five).
Perched high at the back of the stage in the roots of an upside-down tree, CTC composer and sound designer/musician Victor Zupanc provides the music, sound effects and an occasional wave.
The play is a whirl of movement and words. Dolo and Holt change characters with lightning speed, tying on a skirt, throwing a lacy cloth over their shoulders, raising or lowering the brim of a hat, altering their posture, voice, or facial expression. And it’s all so seamless. We can’t begin to grasp how they keep their characters straight (14 in all), remember their many lines and run around the stage like maniacs without crashing into each other or collapsing in tears. Watching them do what they do is jaw-dropping amazing.
Don’t worry that your little ones will be lost or confused. A bit of explaining at the start prepares even very young children for what they’re about to see. As Holt frets aloud that “the others” haven’t yet arrived, Dolo says, “We can tell the story on our own!” When he insists, “We have to wait!” she counters, “I think they want us to start right now!” And kids in the audience yell out, “Yeah! Now!”
If you haven’t been to a play at the Children’s Theatre, the audience is a big part of the fun. There’s a lot of squirming and bouncing, standing up and sitting down, punctuated by frequent potty breaks. When the Prince (played briefly by Dolo) kissed Snow White (briefly Holt) in Sunday afternoon’s performance, the crowd broke out in “ewwwwwws!” Banks knows his audience loves words like “toot” and “poop” and uses them – only once. The script is full of knock-knock jokes and other age-appropriate hilarity. It’s also smart enough for grown-ups to appreciate.
Presented on the Cargill Stage (CTC’s first-floor black box) on a long, narrow super-thrust with the audience on three sides, Banks’ play – a CTC commission and a world premiere – is a revisionist version of the Grimms’ fairy tale. The stepmother is still wicked and vain, with murder in her hard, dark heart. But the prince is a pompous buffoon, not a romantic hero, and Snow White is no Disney princess. She doesn’t care a fig about castles or getting married. What matters to her are her friends, the beauty of nature, the stars in the sky, and birds.
Banks has given the story a surprising and satisfying new ending. “Snow White” runs 75 minutes with no intermission. FMI and tickets ($15-56). Closes Dec. 8.
Catching up on artsy news
While we were on break, the arts galloped on, and much arts-related news was made. In case you missed something you care about, we’ll update you over the next few days. In brief:
The Soap Factory will close at the end of the year. As recently as March, we wrote, “The Soap Factory hopes to reopen on Labor Day.” Sadly, that won’t happen. The past four years have been a rollercoaster – a big grant lost, budgeting woes, grand plans for a multimillion-dollar renovation (with a restaurant facing the river), staff transitions, terminations and turnovers, debt, a sheriff’s sale, plans to move into the basement, and finally this headline on a press release: “Soap Factory to Cease Operations.”
The Soap had a 30-year run that will long be remembered. Great things happened there. The organization will be dissolved by Dec. 31. The historical records have been donated to the University of Minnesota Archives. The 130-year-old building will be redeveloped as commercial office space.
Mia has a new director and president. The New York Times and the Minneapolis Star Tribune both broke the news on Tuesday, Oct. 1. Katherine Crawford Luber, who has led the San Antonio Museum of Art (SAMA) for the past eight years, will succeed Kaywin Feldman as leader of the Minneapolis Institute of Art. Feldman left in March to become the director of the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C.
Luber comes to Mia bearing impressive art credentials: a doctorate in art history from Bryn Mawr, experience at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and the Philadelphia Museum, and curatorship of important exhibitions. She also brings business savvy. Luber has an MBA from Johns Hopkins and launched, managed and sold a successful start-up.
During her years at SAMA, annual attendance doubled, the number of member households tripled, the museum received more than $42 million in major gifts and its profile rose nationally and internationally. As reported by the Star Tribune, SAMA in 2018 had an $11 million budget, 82 full-time employees, 30,000 works and 132,000 visitors. Mia had a $35 million budget, a staff of 250, more than 90,000 works and 700,000 visitors.
In September, Mia’s trustees approved a master plan for the museum by London-based David Chipperfield Architects. As reported by the New York Times, Luber will implement the plan and run the capital campaign to finance the renovations.
Luber will start in her new position on Jan. 2.
The Walker has a new chief curator. On Jan 6, Henriette Huldisch will step into a role at the Walker Art Center that has been vacant since 2015: chief curator. She will also be the Walker’s director of curatorial affairs.
Huldisch, a native of Hamburg, Germany, is currently director of exhibitions and curator at Boston’s List Visual Arts Center, the contemporary art museum at MIT. She has organized several group and solo exhibitions there since her arrival in 2014. Previously Huldisch worked at the Whitney and Hamburger Bahnhof ­— Museum for Contemporary Art — Berlin and was visiting curator at Cornerhouse, an international center for contemporary visual arts and independent film in Manchester, England.
Huldisch is the first major hire for Mary Ceruti, who became the Walker’s executive director in January, succeeding Olga Viso. Huldisch will provide artistic and organizational leadership to the visual arts, performing arts, moving image and education and public programs departments.
The Walker’s most recent chief curator was Darsie Alexander. When she left in 2015, Fionn Meade took over her role, but as artistic director, a newly created position. Meade resigned in Jan. 2017.
The picks
Now at the Minnesota History Center: “Prince: Before the Rain.” Minnesota photographer Allen Beaulieu captured Prince’s trajectory from rising star to superstardom. This exhibit includes album cover outtakes, live performance shots and behind-the-scenes candids of the Purple One taken from the late 1970s into the early 1980s. FMI and tickets ($12 adults; includes all special exhibits and galleries). Closes May 3, 2020.
Now at the Film Society’s St. Anthony Main Theatre: “Memory: The Origins of Alien.” Except for “Aliens” (1986), the sequels have been terrible. James Cameron has been hinting about another one, and we hope he’s not serious. (Build another submersible instead!) Ridley Scott’s original “Alien” (1979) turned science fiction on its head, giving us plenty of grisly scenes, a terrifying creature and a badass heroine. This documentary’s director, Alexandre O. Philippe, also brought us “78/52: Hitchcock’s Shower Scene.” FMI including trailer, times and tickets ($9.50). Ends Oct. 10.
Wednesday through Sunday at Theater Latté Da’s Ritz Theater: “Chicago.” Critics are loving it. We haven’t seen it yet, but we’re going soon. Four performances have been added. Try to get a seat on stage. Arrive early for live pre-show music; starts 30 min. before each performance, and the Ritz lobby is cozy and convivial. 7:30 p.m.; also 2 p.m. Saturdays; 2 p.m. and 7 p.m. Sundays. FMI and tickets (start at $33). Closes Nov. 3.
Thursday at the Anoka County Library: Club Book: Dacre Stoker. He’s the great grand-nephew of Bram Stoker, an expert on all things “Dracula” and manager of his famous ancestor’s estate. He’s written a sequel, “Dracula: The Undead,” built on Bram Stoker’s handwritten notes, and coauthored a prequel, “Dracul,” with Bram as the central protagonist. For fans of “Dracula,” this couldn’t be more perfect. 7 p.m. FMI. Free. If you miss the in-person event, you can catch the podcast a few days later.

Study finds a quarter of all U.S. health spending is wasteful

Texto completo: Even a divided America can agree on this goal: a health system that is cheaper but doesn’t sacrifice quality. In other words, just get rid of the waste.
A new study, published Monday morning in JAMA, finds that roughly 20% to 25% of U.S. health care spending is wasteful. It’s a startling number but not a new finding. What is surprising is how little we know about how to prevent it.
William Shrank, a physician who is chief medical officer of the health insurer Humana and the lead author of the study, said, “One contribution of our study is that we show that we have good evidence on how to eliminate some kinds of waste, but not all of it.”
Following the best available evidence, as reviewed in the study, would eliminate only one-quarter of the waste — reducing health spending by about 5%.
Teresa Rogstad of Humana and Natasha Parekh, a physician with the University of Pittsburgh, were co-authors of the study, which combed through 54 studies and reports published since 2012 that estimated the waste or savings from changes in practice and policy.
Because U.S. health spending is so high — almost 18% of the economy and over $10,000 per person per year — even small percentages in savings translate into huge dollars.
The estimated waste is at least $760 billion per year. That’s comparable to government spending on Medicare and exceeds national military spending, as well as total primary and secondary education spending.
If we followed the evidence available, we would save about $200 billion per year, about what is spent on the medical care for veterans, the Department of Education and the Department of Energy, combined. That amount could provide health insurance for at least 20 million Americans, or three-quarters of the currently uninsured population.
The largest source of waste, according to the study, is administrative costs, totaling $266 billion a year. This includes time and resources devoted to billing and reporting to insurers and public programs. Despite this high cost, the authors found no studies that evaluate approaches to reducing it.
“That doesn’t mean we have no ideas about how to reduce administrative costs,” said Don Berwick, a physician and senior fellow at the Institute for Healthcare Improvement and author of an editorial on the JAMA study.
Moving to a single-payer system, he suggested, would largely eliminate the vast administrative complexity required by attending to the payment and reporting requirements of various private payers and public programs. But doing so would run up against powerful stakeholders whose incomes derive from the status quo. “What stands in the way of reducing waste — especially administrative waste and out-of-control prices — is much more a lack of political will than a lack of ideas about how to do it.”
While the lead author works for Humana, he also has experience in government and academia, and this is being seen as a major attempt to refine previous studies of health care waste. Reflecting the study’s importance, JAMA published several accompanying editorials. A co-author of one editorial, Ashish Jha of the Harvard Global Health Institute and the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, said: “It’s perfectly possible to reduce administrative waste in a system with private insurance. In fact, Switzerland, the Netherlands and other countries with private payers have much lower administrative costs than we do. We should focus our energies on administrative simplification, not whether it’s in a single-payer system or not.”
After administrative costs, prices are the next largest area that the JAMA study identified as waste. The authors’ estimate for this is $231 billion to $241 billion per year, on prices that are higher than what would be expected in more competitive health care markets or if we imposed price controls common in many other countries. The study points to high brand drug prices as the major contributor. Although not explicitly raised in the study, consolidated hospital markets also contribute to higher prices.
A variety of approaches could push prices downward, but something might be lost in doing so. “High drug prices do motivate investment and innovation,” said Rachel Sachs, an associate professor of law at Washington University in St. Louis.
That doesn’t mean all innovation is good or worth the price. “It means we should be aware of how we reduce prices, taking into consideration which kinds of products and which populations it might affect,” she said.
Likewise, studies show that when hospitals are paid less, quality can degrade, even leading to higher mortality rates.
Other categories of waste examined by the JAMA study encompass inefficient, low-value and uncoordinated care. Together, these total at least $205 billion.
With more than half of medical treatments lacking solid evidence of effectiveness, it’s not surprising that these areas add up to a large total. They include things like hospital-acquired infections; use of high-cost services when lower-cost ones would suffice; low rates of preventive care; avoidable complications and avoidable hospital admissions and readmissions; and services that provide little to no benefit.
In addition to wasting money, these problems can have direct adverse health effects; lead to unwarranted patient anxiety and stress; and lower patient satisfaction and trust in the health system.
Here the study’s findings are relatively more optimistic. It found evidence on approaches that could eliminate up to half of waste in these categories. The current movement toward value-based payment, promoted by the Affordable Care Act, is intended to address these issues while removing their associated waste. The idea is to pay hospitals and doctors in ways that incentivize efficiency and good outcomes, rather than paying for every service regardless of need or results.
Putting this theory into practice has proved difficult. “Value-based payment hasn’t been as effective as people had hoped,” said Karen Joynt Maddox, a physician and co-director of the Center for Health Economics and Policy at Washington University in St. Louis and a co-author of another editorial of the JAMA study.
So far, only a few value-based payment approaches seem to produce savings, and not a lot. Some of the more promising approaches are those that give hospitals and doctors a single payment “as opposed to paying for individual services,” said Zirui Song, a physician and a health economist with Harvard Medical School.
“Savings tend to come from physicians referring patients to lower-priced facilities or cutting back on potentially lower-value care in areas such as procedures, tests or post-acute service,” he said.
There is evidence of savings from some bundled payment programs. These provide a fixed overall budget for care related to a procedure over a specific period, like 90 days of hip replacement care. Accountable care organizations also seem to drive out a little waste. These give health groups the chance to earn bonuses for accepting financial risk and if they reach some targets on quality of care.
The final area of waste illuminated by the JAMA study is fraud and abuse, accounting for $59 billion to $84 billion a year. As much as politicians love to say they’ll tackle this, it’s a relatively small fraction of overall health care waste, around 10 percent. More could be spent on reducing it, but there’s an obvious drawback if it costs more than a dollar to save a dollar in fraud.
Because health care waste comes from many sources, no single policy will address it. Most important, we have evidence on how to reduce only a small fraction of the waste — we need to do a better job of amassing evidence about what works.

Opinion: A founding father who made Connecticut proud

Texto completo: On the Fourth of July this year, New York Times columnist Gail Collins, no doubt reflecting general opinion, wrote about the five-person committee assigned by the Continental Congress to write a declaration of independence, correctly identifying Thomas Jefferson as its author, with minor edits by John Adams and Benjamin Franklin. About the other two committee members she wrote, “we don’t remember much;” perhaps we could “look them up as a holiday project.”
One of those was Robert R. Livingston of New York, who in congressional debate actually urged delaying the declaration’s publication. He failed in that endeavor, and was elected by the Congress to head the Department of Foreign Affairs. After the Revolution, Livingston remained prominent as a Jeffersonian in New York politics and was instrumental in bringing about the state’s ratification of the U.S. Constitution. In later years, he provided much-needed support for Jefferson’s Louisiana Purchase. Yet Livingston remains widely unknown outside of New York.
The other of Collins’ unknown committee members was the stern-faced but much respected Roger Sherman of New Haven. Sherman, who was put on the committee to balance the less radical Livingston, was one of the nation’s first full-time politicians. He served more time in national congresses than any other legislator and, in that capacity, was the only signer of all four foundational American documents: the Declaration of Independence, the Articles of Confederation, the treaty of peace with England and the U.S. Constitution. He was elected to the first U.S. Congress and was serving in the Senate when he died in 1793. Sherman served in Connecticut’s lower house and its Council, which was both its upper house and highest judiciary. He dominated local politics and the state’s delegation to the U.S. Congress. In Congress, he successfully insisted that the protections of individual rights be appended to 10 separate articles rather than integrated at points in the original document, as James Madison proposed.
Sherman, along with the other committee members, is depicted on the U.S. $2 bill.
Sherman was New Haven’s first mayor, when the town was incorporated as a city. Through Roger Sherman, New Haven’s influence in the nation’s founding is solid and noteworthy. We actually know quite a lot about him.

Christopher Collier, professor of history emeritus at the University of Connecticut, was Connecticut state historian from 1984-2000. He is the author of “Roger Sherman’s Connecticut: Yankee Politics and the American Revolution.”

Texto completo: Not all theme park rides are created equally as some Disney World visitors found out this weekend when they became stranded for hours on the brand new Skyliner gondola ride and had to be rescued by firefighters.
The unfortunate incident illustrated an unsettling theme park truth: Some rides are worse than others to get stuck on.
It’s a lot easier to evacuate from the Haunted Mansion, Pirates of the Caribbean or the Mad Tea Party if the attraction malfunctions than a gondola ride dangling from a cable several stories in the sky.
Skyliner passengers were stuck for up to three hours and had to be rescued by firefighters using ladder trucks when the new aerial cable car ride malfunctioned Saturday night.
A few unfortunate theme park visitors have found out first hand that it’s much harder to evacuate an attraction when they are way up in the air on a swing tower ride or an elevated monorail. Or even worse, upside down on a looping coaster or thrill ride.
Let’s take a closer look at some recent incidents that illustrate the worst types of rides to get stranded on at a theme park.
Joker’s Jinx at Six Flags America — Two dozen riders were trapped for more than three hours in April 2017 when the launch coaster stalled on the track at the Maryland amusement park. Firefighters used a hydraulic crane to rescue the riders who were stuck 80 feet in the air at a 30-degree angle, according to Washington’s NBC4 News.
Sky Cabin at Knott’s Berry Farm — The gyro tower stopped revolving and became stuck 125 feet in the air for eight hours in December 2016 at the Buena Park theme park, according to the Orange County Register. Riders were rescued by firefighters and lowered by harness.
Monorail at Walt Disney World — Passengers were stranded for hours when the Monorail Gold line stopped on the track at the Florida theme park resort in October 2015, according to the Orlando Sentinel. Fire crews evacuated the trains by cherry picker.
Windseeker at Knott’s Berry Farm — The 300-foot-tall tower swing ride stranded riders in mid-air for nearly four hours in September 2012 at the Buena Park theme park, according to the Orange County Register. Similar incidents occurred with the Mondial tower rides during the 2012 and 2013 seasons at Cedar Point, Kings Island and Carowinds. The Knott’s ride was relocated to Missouri’s Worlds of Fun in 2014 and renamed SteelHawk.
Invertigo at California’s Great America — Passengers were stranded 80 feet in the air for more than four hours in August 2009 at the Santa Clara amusement park when the roller coaster became stuck on the lift hill. Firefighters rescued 24 riders and evacuated them down a staircase, according to the San Jose Mercury News. Invertigo was relocated to Pennsylvania’s Dorney Park in 2012 and renamed Stinger. Dorney has since retired the coaster.
King Kahuna at Kennywood — Riders were stranded upside down when a Huss Top Spin ride malfunctioned in July 2008 at the Pennsylvania theme park, according to the Associated Press. The thrill ride featured seats on a rotating platform that spun 360 degrees forward and backward between two pendulum arms. The Kennywood ride was removed after the 2009 season.
Batman and Robin: The Chiller at Six Flags Great Adventure — A lightning strike knocked out power to the New Jersey amusement park in August 2004 and stranded riders upside down 75 feet in the air on the electrically powered launch coaster, according to the New York Times. Park employees eventually eased the train down to a position where riders could evacuate. The dueling shuttle coaster was removed after the 2007 season.

Leonard Pitts Jr.: How the times have changed

Texto completo: You may, if you are old enough, recall a TV actor named Foster Brooks.
He was a guest star on such classics of boomer kitsch as “The Monkees,” “The Munsters” and “The Mod Squad.” But if you do remember him, it’s likely for one thing only: his imitation of inebriation. Brooks made his slurring, stammering “funny drunk act” a TV staple, back when drunks were still considered, well … funny.
To recall his career is to marvel at what a difference a generation or two makes.
That era produced another TV trope that, in hindsight, seems equally bizarre: the funny sexual harasser. A hundred times, you saw it: the lecherous boss chasing the nubile secretary around the desk. A hundred times, it didn’t register as anything but a joke.
And again, the memory makes you marvel at how the times, they have changed.
In their new book, “She Said,” Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey, The New York Times reporters who broke the Harvey Weinstein sexual harassment story, remind us that early October contains three anniversaries, each a milestone of the progress we have - and have not - made in learning to take sexual assault seriously.
October 7, 2016: The Washington Post releases the now-infamous “Access Hollywood” video where presidential candidate Donald Trump brags about sexually assaulting women. “And when you’re a star, they let you do it,” he says. “Grab them by the p--y. You can do anything.”
October 5, 2018: The Senate advances the nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court despite a credible allegation that, as a drunken teenager, he attempted to rape a then-classmate, research psychologist Christine Blasey Ford.
Between those two dates - October 5, 2017 - The Times published its report on the film producer Weinstein and his alleged assaults on women in his professional circle, including the actor Ashley Judd. Later, Gwyneth Paltrow and Annabella Sciorra would also number themselves among the accusers.
The story opened a floodgate. By the time the wave of accusations crested, it had splashed dozens of famous men: Matt Lauer, Charlie Rose, Mario Batali, Louis C.K., George H.W. Bush and Al Franken among them. Once-silent women found their voices under a hashtag - #MeToo.
“She Said” recounts the journalistic detective work that led to the breakthrough. It’s a compelling story that leaves one pleased to see the good guys - the good “gals,” really - get a win. But let us be clear on the limitations of that win. Indeed, the convergence of those anniversaries speaks eloquently to America’s ongoing irresolution on matters of sexual harassment and assault. Sure, Weinstein is facing charges, but Kavanaugh went to the Supreme Court, and Trump, to the White House.
Still, the story Twohey and Kantor broke changed gender politics. Predictably, there came a backlash, increasing numbers of male managers reportedly refusing to mentor female subordinates. That would seem to open them to civil sanctions. It will be fun to watch one of them try to defend his sexism in court, perhaps before a judge with lady parts.
Elsewhere, folks just want to know, where is the line? Is it allowed to tell a co-worker you find her attractive? Can you share - or laugh at - a bawdy joke? “So much was suddenly open to question,” write Kantor and Twohey.
And it is. And that is surely frustrating and difficult.
On the other hand, some of us remember when the boss chased the secretary while the laugh track howled. We thought nothing of it. Now people are wondering what’s acceptable?
Maybe that’s not the worst thing in the world.

Daily on Energy: Perry treks to Europe as he faces questions over Ukraine

Energy Secretary Rick Perry is not slowing down his trademark energy diplomacy this week as he faces questions about his role on issues relevant to the impeachment inquiry into President Trump focused on Ukraine.
Perry’s trip to Europe — which includes a meeting with officials from Ukraine — comes after reporting this weekend that he pressed Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky to curb corruption at its state-run gas firm Naftogaz and install new American members on the company’s board (see more details below).
Perry is planning to resign in the coming months before the 2020 election campaign heats up, sources confirmed to Josh last week, but it’s unclear how much the Ukraine probe is playing into his thinking.
One of his top priorities has been to push Eastern European countries dependent on energy from Russia to increase imports of American liquified natural gas, touting gas’s role in reducing emissions in the U.S. as an alternative to coal.
His trip appears to be an effort to finish that work before he leaves.
"One of the priorities of [the Trump administration] was building an energy security strategy focused on central and eastern Europe, and Ukraine was a major focus of it,” a former Trump administration official told Josh. “The objective is consistent going back to the Reagan administration in reducing Europe's energy dependence on Russia. It's designed to give Ukraine another option."
Of Perry’s trip, the former official said: "If he’s going to leave, I'm assuming he wants to clear the decks and get it completed."
Perry tweeted Monday that he participated in a trilateral meeting in Lithuania with Ukrainian Energy Minister Oleksii Orzhel and Polish Deputy Energy Minister Tomasz Dąbrowski.
“The United States strongly supports Ukraine and Poland’s effort to enhance regional energy security,” Perry said.
The Energy Department said Perry was seeking to follow up on a recent Memorandum of Cooperation signed in Warsaw last month to develop “enhanced interconnections” between Poland and Ukraine to develop natural gas infrastructure.
In a tweet Sunday, Perry said he would also discuss “regional energy cooperation” in nuclear and renewables.
On Tuesday, Perry plans to continue his travels to Latvia where he will deliver the keynote address at the EuroGas Central and Eastern Europe Conference to discuss “energy security through energy diversity.”
He’ll finish his trip Thursday in Iceland to give the keynote address at the Arctic Circle Assembly where he will discuss the “economic and energy potential” of the Arctic.

TRUMP AND GIULIANI ASSOCIATES PRESSURED UKRAINE OVER GAS COMPANY TO BENEFIT ALLIES: Associates of Trump and his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani urged Ukraine to install new leadership at state-run gas firm Naftogaz in order to benefit some of their allies, according to the Associated Press.
The associates included businessmen and Republican donors linked to both Trump and Giuliani, connections they touted as they pressured the country. Their plan reportedly was to steer lucrative contracts to companies controlled by Trump allies.
However, the plan hit a snag when then-President Petro Poroshenko lost the 2019 election to Zelensky.
Perry then took up efforts to install new management at the firm with Zelensky, but it's unclear if his attempt was in coordination with the Trump and Giuliani allies.
“What he did not do is advocate for the business interests of any one individual or company,” DOE spokeswoman Shaylyn Hynes told AP. “That is fiction being pushed by those who are disingenuously seeking to advance a nefarious narrative that does not exist.”
TRUMP BLAMES UKRAINE CALL ON PERRY: The news comes amid reports that Trump told congressional Republicans that Perry pressed him to make the the July 25 phone call in which he urged Zelensky to investigate his political rivals.
"Not a lot of people know this, but I didn't even want to make the call. The only reason I made the call was because Rick asked me to. Something about an LNG [liquified natural gas] plant," Trump reportedly told House Republicans on Friday.
DOE’s Hynes confirmed Perry urged Trump to speak with Zelensky "to discuss matters related to their energy security and economic development."
According to notes released by the White House, Zelensky talked to Trump about buying U.S. oil and "cooperating on energy independence" with the U.S. but did not mention Perry or LNG.
INTERIOR ENDS MORATORIUM ON DRILLING IN CENTRAL CALIFORNIA: The Interior Department approved a plan Friday to open more than 700,000 acres of land in Northern and Central California to oil and gas drilling.
The agency still must approve permits from companies for drilling to occur, but the move lifts a more than five-year-old moratorium on leasing of federal lands across California’s Central Coast and Bay Area. Interior’s Bureau of Land Management has not held a lease sale in California since 2013.
Environmental groups protested the decision to allow drilling in Fresno, Monterey, San Benito, and other counties, and vowed to challenge it.
“This reckless move is the toxic convergence of Trump’s climate denial, loyalty to the oil industry and grudge against California,” said Clare Lakewood, a senior attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity.
MORE REPUBLICANS BALK AT EPA METHANE ROLLBACK: Maine Senator Susan Collins and Florida Congressman Matt Gaetz are the latest to speak out against the Environmental Protection Agency’s plans to eliminate direct regulation of methane from the oil and gas sector. The two Republican lawmakers joined their Democratic colleagues — Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy and California Congressman Scott Peters — on a letter Friday urging the EPA to reverse course.
Methane, the main component of natural gas, warms the atmosphere around two dozen times faster than carbon dioxide, according to EPA scientists. The EPA proposed in August to remove direct regulation of methane from new oil and gas drilling operations. But the move split the oil and gas industry — as major producers like BP and Shell called on the EPA to continue regulating methane.
In their letter, the bipartisan lawmakers say they’re skeptical EPA’s removal of methane regulation would lead to significant cost savings. And they question whether the EPA’s plan is within the bounds of the Clean Air Act.
Republican congressmen Francis Rooney of Florida and Garret Graves of Louisiana have also publicly opposed the EPA’s methane move.
TRUMP FINALLY TAPS NOMINEE FOR EPA WATCHDOG: And that nominee doesn’t appear to be controversial. The White House announced Friday it is nominating Sean O’Donnell to lead the EPA’s Office of Inspector General, tasked with investigating any fraud, misconduct, or inefficiency within the agency.
O’Donnell is a career civil servant. Most recently, he’s been serving at the Department of Justice as a trial attorney in its criminal division. In that position, he’s worked with several inspector general offices, according to the White House.
The EPA’s inspector general post has been vacant for a year. The EPA’s prior inspector general, Arthur Elkins, retired in October 2018 after eight years on the job — and a tumultuous, busy final year probing former EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt’s ethical controversies. Deputy Inspector General Charles Sheehan has been filling in as acting head since then.
DISCUSSIONS FLOWING ON WOTUS: EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler is in North Dakota today as part of a victory lap on the agency’s repeal of the Obama administration’s clean water rule. The EPA formally repealed the Obama-era rule — known as Waters of the United States, or WOTUS — in September.
The repeal is a major win for Republican lawmakers, particularly those in states with a lot of energy development or agriculture. North Dakota Senators Kevin Cramer and John Hoeven are joining Wheeler at the roundtable discussion.
Next up: The EPA must finish its replacement of WOTUS, which defined what bodies of water are covered under federal protections. Environmental groups and Democratic-led states have already blasted the EPA’s proposal, which would sharply reduce the number of water bodies covered. Wheeler said in September the EPA hopes to finish its replacement rule this winter.

Moses the first paperboy? For National Newspaper Week, a (slightly embellished) history

Texto completo: National Newspaper Week is Sunday through Saturday. Here are a few fun facts to mark the designation of the oldest-known journalistic medium.
The early days
Long before shredded wood pulp was pressed into use for the manufacture of paper, other materials were employed to record and display public news. One could argue that the first big breaking news story ever documented in writing was the announcement of the Ten Commandments, recorded on ancient stone tablets.
By logical extension, as he raced down Mount Sinai shouting the sobering news, Moses might be considered the first paperboy (and I'm paraphrasing here):
"Extra! Extra! Read all about it: idolatry, blasphemy, coveting, adultery banned - citizens in shock!"
By 60 B.C., the rising Roman Empire still followed the Fred Flintstone printing technique with public announcements laboriously chiseled in granite - surely the origin of the term "hard news."
But it's unlikely much attention was paid to these humble bulletins since they consisted of rather dreary government headlines: "Caesar to Appear in Senate on Ides of March." However, politicians soon took note and all Caesars who followed learned to recognize the power of the press.
Advances in printing
The importance of posting news items for citizens was likely first widely appreciated by the public after the summer of 79 A.D. If only some travel editor had the foresight to publish an article headlined "Visitors Flock to Pompeii Despite Smoking Vesuvius," perhaps disaster could have been averted for vacationers on the Italian coast.
By 200 A.D in China, news was disseminated on handwritten silk sheets called tipaos. Although much easier to distribute, this technique didn't always produce error-free copy and possibly gave rise to the first "typos."
Centuries later, as writing, literacy and the printing press spread across Europe, so did modern newspapers. The earliest were handwritten sheets appearing in 16th-century Venice, although the very first is thought to have been a 1605 German publication titled "Relation aller Fürnemmen und gedenckwürdigen Historien," which translates into "Collection of all Distinguished and Commemorable News." A lofty inaugural title indeed, and one which newspapers have endeavored to live up to ever since.
Newspaper firsts
The oldest newspaper still in publication today is the Swedish Post-och Inrikes Tidningar (Post and Domestic Times) which, since 2007, has been published online only. Still, claiming to be the world's oldest newspaper after some 370 years makes a most impressive "About Us" website link.
In the U.S., the Boston News-Letter is a contender for the first continuously published newspaper beginning in 1704 and ending in 1776 during the early stages of the revolutionary conflict. Among the lead stories of its day was the 1718 death of the pirate Blackbeard off the Carolina coast. Pirate news remains topical today, although more likely to feature battles with baseballs rather than cannonballs.
The Virginian-Pilot covered some historical stories over the years, too, and was "the first and only newspaper" to report the Wright Brothers Dec. 17, 1903 powered flight. Published the following day, the story was riddled with errors but amended in 2003 on the centenary of the flight. So never let it be said the press doesn't correct its mistakes.
Established in 1801, the New York Post claimed its place in daily journalism history in a 2001 editorial declaring it was the "nation's oldest continuously published newspaper." How could one dispute such a claim from a publication that once famously displayed the front-page headline: "Headless Body in Topless Bar"?
However, when U.S. newspapers that began as weeklies are included, the distinction of being the oldest still in publication goes to either the New Hampshire Gazette (1756) or the Hartford Courant (1764), depending on which editor you ask. Let's just say they're both considerably older than the Huffington Post.
Newspaper names
Rather than unashamedly name a publication (even an electronic one) after its founder, newspapers have traditionally taken the title of a town, county or state, followed by a term indicative of a public journal such as Gazette, Tribune or Chronicle. Some of the oldest with large circulations include The New York Times, The Virginian-Pilot and The Washington Post, which began publication in 1851, 1865 and 1877, respectively.
Publishers of smaller newspapers have, on occasion, launched their periodical with more casual titles. These include the Carmel Pine Cone in California and the historic Arizona Tombstone Epitaph, which covered the 30-second gunfight at the local O.K. Corral in 1881. The Carlisle Mosquito (Massachusetts) still features all the local buzz, while Wyoming's Laramie Boomerang is popular with most locals except its bicycle-riding paperboys, who have always claimed the traditional method of residential delivery is challenging.
But the vast majority of small U.S. towns have never produced a local newspaper, although there are areas - Weakley, Tenn.; Cow Yard, Mass.; Hell, Mich.; Sweet Lips, Tenn.; Hardy, Calif.; Peculiar, Mo. - where it should be considered.
Should imaginative publishers ever decide to introduce newspapers to those markets (all actual towns, counties or unincorporated communities), adopting a catchy name might inspire a healthy circulation. After all, what resident could resist subscribing to the Weakley Weekly, the Cow Yard Breeze, Hell Today, Sweet Lips Appeal, the Hardy Constitution, or the Peculiar Citizen?
And down in Butts County, Ga., one local newspaper is named the Jackson Progress-Argus. One can only speculate how the original publisher must have resisted the temptation to go with the Butts Examiner. Should such a rebranding ever occur, however, that's news even Moses could deliver with a chuckle.

Texto completo: Energy Secretary Rick Perry encouraged President Trump to speak to Ukraine's president — but on energy and economic issues, Perry's spokeswoman said Sunday, addressing Perry's role in a telephone call that is at the center of a congressional impeachment probe for Trump.
"Secretary Perry absolutely supported and encouraged the president to speak to the new president of Ukraine to discuss matters related to their energy security and economic development," Perry's Energy Department spokeswoman, Shaylyn Hynes, said in an e-mail.
Hynes's remark comes as Perry becomes the latest administration official drawn into inquiries in a House impeachment probe of Trump. Trump pressed President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine in the July 25 call to investigate former vice president Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, sparking a whistle-blower complaint and now the impeachment inquiry.
Trump on Friday evening told House Republicans that it was Perry who had set up the July call with Ukraine, according to a person familiar with Trump's new comments who was granted anonymity to discuss the private conference call.
But Trump did not suggest that Perry had anything to do with the pressure on Ukraine to investigate the Bidens, or a US holdup in military aid to the country, the person said. Trump's remarks on the late Friday call were first reported by Axios.
Perry, the former governor of Texas and up to now a lower-profile but active member of Trump's Cabinet, has made repeated trips to Ukraine and met often with Ukrainian officials, including Zelensky. Perry and his agency say his involvement with Ukraine was part of US policy, predating the Trump administration, to increase US natural gas, coal, and other supplies to Eastern Europe to lessen Russia's control of the region's energy market.
Hynes did not immediately answer questions Sunday about whether Perry had discussed the Trump administration's push for help investigating Trump's Democratic rivals in his meetings with Ukraine.
But Perry told an evangelical Christian news outlet, CBN News, in an interview that aired Friday that he had never heard anyone in the administration bring up Biden or Biden's son, who served on a board of a Ukraine natural gas business, in dealings with Ukrainian officials.

Anti-Muslim group plans to host gala at Mar-a-Lago
An anti-Muslim organization plans to host its annual gala at Mar-a-Lago, President Trump's private club in Palm Beach, Fla., in November.
ACT for America claims to be the nation's largest grass-roots national security organization, and is considered the largest anti-Muslim group in the United States, according to the Anti-Defamation League and the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks such groups.
Michelle Malkin, a conservative columnist, author, and television commentator, will be the keynote speaker, according to an invitation posted on the organization's website. Standard tickets are $1,500 per person and premium tickets, which put attendees at the head tables, are $2,500. Premium tickets are sold out, according to the website.
“I don't think it should occur," said Ibrahim Hooper, a spokesman for the Council on American-Islamic Relations, a Muslim civil rights and advocacy organization. “It's really a violation of the US Constitution to funnel funds from a hate group directly to the president and his business," he said, referring to the emoluments clauses of the Constitution.
The domestic clause, also known as the anticorruption clause, establishes that the president's salary remain constant throughout his term and ensures that he not accept any additional sum.
In 2018, Trump made $22.7 million from Mar-a-Lago, The Miami Herald reported, citing a financial disclosure form filed with the US Office of Government Ethics.
ACT for America and the White House did not respond to calls for comment Saturday.
In an e-mail Sunday, a spokeswoman for the Trump Organization said, without elaboration, “This event will absolutely not be taking place at Mar-a-Lago." She did not respond to additional questions.

Trump to hold election eve rally against La. governor
President Trump is heading to Louisiana ahead of Saturday's election, for a last-minute rally aimed at peeling support from Governor John Bel Edwards and keeping the Democratic incumbent from a primary win.
Trump tweeted Sunday about the get-out-the-vote event, saying he's working to elect "a great new Republican Governor!" He hasn't endorsed one of the GOP candidates, Ralph Abraham and Eddie Rispone.
The president's event will be held Friday night in Lake Charles, in southwest Louisiana.
In Louisiana, all candidates run against each other, regardless of party, on the same primary ballot. Polls show Edwards well in the lead, ahead of his two main Republican challengers, within striking distance of topping 50% and reaching a primary win.
Trump's visit follows a GOP voter rally in Kenner featuring Vice President Mike Pence.

Former president Jimmy Carter 'feels fine' after fall
Former president Jimmy Carter fell Sunday at his home in Georgia and needed some stitches above his brow, but "feels fine," his spokeswoman said.
Deanna Congileo said in an e-mail that the 39th president fell Sunday in Plains and received stitches. Carter turned 95 on Tuesday, becoming the first US president to reach that milestone.
Congileo said Carter and his wife, Rosalynn, who is 92, were eager to be at a Habitat for Humanity build in Nashville. The opening ceremony for the project was scheduled for Sunday evening and it runs through Friday.
Carter survived a dire cancer diagnosis in 2015 and surpassed George H.W. Bush as the longest-lived U.S. president in history this spring. He has had some trouble walking after a hip replacement in May, but regularly teaches Sunday School.
Meanwhile, he has continued with his humanitarian work. And he also has occasionally weighed in on politics and policy, recently expressing hopes that his Carter Center will become a more forceful advocate against armed conflicts in the future, including "wars by the United States."
"I just want to keep the whole world at peace," Carter had said as he presented his annual Carter Center report last month.
"We have been at war more than 226 years. We have been at peace for about 16 years" since the Declaration of Independence in 1776, he said, adding that every US military conflict from the Korean War onward has been a war of "choice."
Carter also has been accepting visits from several 2020 presidential candidates, but he has held back on endorsing any of his fellow Democrats, offering only clues to his thinking.

Texto completo: You may, if you are old enough, recall a TV actor named Foster Brooks.
He was a guest star on such classics of boomer kitsch as "The Monkees," "The Munsters" and "The Mod Squad." But if you do remember him, it's likely for one thing only: his imitation of inebriation. Brooks made his slurring, stammering "funny drunk act" a TV staple, back when drunks were still considered, well ... funny.
To recall his career is to marvel at what a difference a generation or two makes.
That era produced another TV trope that, in hindsight, seems equally bizarre: the funny sexual harasser. A hundred times, you saw it: the lecherous boss chasing the nubile secretary around the desk. A hundred times, it didn't register as anything but a joke.
And again, the memory makes you marvel at how the times, they have changed.
In their new book, “She Said,” Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey, The New York Times reporters who broke the Harvey Weinstein sexual harassment story, remind us that early October contains three anniversaries, each a milestone of the progress we have — and have not — made in learning to take sexual assault seriously.
October 7, 2016: The Washington Post releases the now-infamous “Access Hollywood” video where presidential candidate Donald Trump brags about sexually assaulting women. “And when you’re a star, they let you do it,” he says. “Grab them by the p---y. You can do anything.”
October 5, 2018: The Senate advances the nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court despite a credible allegation that, as a drunken teenager, he attempted to rape a then-classmate, research psychologist Christine Blasey Ford.
Between those two dates — October 5, 2017 — The Times published its report on the film producer Weinstein and his alleged assaults on women in his professional circle, including the actor Ashley Judd. Later, Gwyneth Paltrow and Annabella Sciorra would also number themselves among the accusers.
The story opened a floodgate. By the time the wave of accusations crested, it had splashed dozens of famous men: Matt Lauer, Charlie Rose, Mario Batali, Louis C.K., George H.W. Bush and Al Franken among them. Once-silent women found their voices under a hashtag — #MeToo.
"She Said" recounts the journalistic detective work that led to the breakthrough. It's a compelling story that leaves one pleased to see the good guys — the good "gals," really — get a win. But let us be clear on the limitations of that win. Indeed, the convergence of those anniversaries speaks eloquently to America's ongoing irresolution on matters of sexual harassment and assault. Sure, Weinstein is facing charges, but Kavanaugh went to the Supreme Court, and Trump, to the White House.
Still, the story Twohey and Kantor broke changed gender politics. Predictably, there came a backlash, increasing numbers of male managers reportedly refusing to mentor female subordinates. That would seem to open them to civil sanctions. It will be fun to watch one of them try to defend his sexism in court, perhaps before a judge with lady parts.
Elsewhere, folks just want to know, where is the line? Is it allowed to tell a co-worker you find her attractive? Can you share — or laugh at — a bawdy joke? "So much was suddenly open to question," write Kantor and Twohey.
And it is. And that is surely frustrating and difficult.
On the other hand, some of us remember when the boss chased the secretary while the laugh track howled. We thought nothing of it. Now people are wondering what's acceptable?
Maybe that's not the worst thing in the world.

Viewpoints, whistleblowers: Intelligence whistleblowers often pay a severe price

Texto completo: In many instances, whistleblowers find the abusive power they have revealed turned against them, both ending their careers and harming their personal lives.
In the private sector, whistleblowers are often ignored and told their concern is not part of their job description - and are commonly retaliated against by being demoted or fired.
When a whistleblower is in the U.S. intelligence and national security sphere, they're often speaking out about misdeeds by powerful figures - and, as a result, have frequently faced death threats, physical attacks, prosecution and prison.
The new whistleblower report that alleges wrongdoing by the president is a reminder of the vital importance of holding wrongdoers accountable, regardless of their level of power. When those acts affect national security, whistleblowing is even more important. But as I've found in my whistleblowing research, whistleblowers in this arena have far fewer legal protections from retaliation than those in corporate settings or elsewhere in government.
Targets of retaliation
The consequences for government whistleblowers in the last 20 years have been harsh, in part because laws about classified information have made it difficult for people to publicize wrongdoing on sensitive issues.
After William Binney and J. Kirk Wiebe alleged in 2002 that their employer, the National Security Agency, mismanaged intelligence-gathering software that potentially could have prevented 9/11, their homes were raided and ransacked by the FBI as their families watched. Ultimately, the NSA revoked their security clearances and they were forced to sue to recover the confiscated personal property.
Another NSA whistleblower, Thomas Drake, alleged in 2002 that the agency's mass-surveillance programs after 9/11 involved fraud, waste and violations of citizens' rights. He became the subject of one of the biggest government leak investigations of all time and was prosecuted for espionage, which he ultimately settled through a plea agreement.
A third NSA whistleblower, Edward Snowden has spent years in exile, fearing an unfair trial should he return to the U.S.
Former Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning has spent years in federal prison for releasing classified documents regarding U.S. military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.
Difficult consequences can come not just from the government but also from the public and the media. The New York Times has come under criticism for revealing identifying details about the current whistleblower's position.
Few protections
Most laws governing federal whistleblowers lay out a procedure for coming forward with concerns, offer protections for confidentiality, and prevent recipients of information from harassing, threatening, demoting, firing or discriminating against the person raising the complaint.
Whistleblowers reporting securities law violations to the Securities and Exchange Commission have those protections. So do whistleblowers who report on fraudulent billing or claims against the government, such as Medicare or Medicaid fraud.
It can be difficult to find a balance between the government's need to protect highly sensitive classified information and the public's interest in uncovering wrongdoing. As a result, protections for whistleblowers in the intelligence community lack robust protections. The Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act of 1998 outlines a process for whistleblowers in the intelligence community to raise concerns, but doesn't explicitly protect the whistleblower from retaliation or being publicly identified. Two executive-branchdirectives, created during the Obama administration, do bar retaliation against whistleblowers. However, they create a conflict of interest, because the person who determines whether there has been retaliation may be the person doing the retaliating.
Those Obama-era directives also prevent the whistleblower from seeking an independent court's review. They do not specify whether and exactly how aggrieved whistleblowers are entitled to back pay or reinstatement of employment, which are common whistleblower remedies.
It's no surprise, then, that in the first 10 years after the Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act was enacted, no intelligence whistleblower was compensated for retaliation. While there have been no subsequent inquiries or information to determine whether intelligence whistleblowers have fared better since 2009, the law as it stands makes it nearly impossible for them to be protected.
Whistleblowers bring much-needed attention to matters of interest and importance to the public. Their courage - and willingness to face professional and personal peril - helps bring to light information that others would prefer to keep secret. That helps society as a whole fight injustice, waste, corruption and abuse of power, rather than passively and blindly accepting it.

Boeing CEO's fate tied to 737 Max as key tests loom

Texto completo: Boeing is entering a crucial period for its grounded 737 Max jetliner and its chief executive officer.
Dennis Muilenburg's future is inextricably tied to that of the plane, which is nearing a key test with the Federal Aviation Administration amid a flying ban in its seventh month after two deadly crashes. If regulators approve the aircraft to return to the skies, Boeing's best-selling jet must still win acceptance from airline flight crews and the flying public.
For Muilenburg, there's no playbook for charting a comeback from one of the worst calamities in the history of the aerospace industry. But investors have been betting on Boeing's resurgence in recent weeks, and any fresh setback for the company's biggest source of profit would increase the murmurs for a leadership change.
"This is not about me, right? It's about our company and what we do for our customers," Muilenburg said in an interview when asked if he is the right person to lead Boeing through the crisis. "I will serve in this role with everything that I have as long as the board wants me serving in this role."
Muilenburg, an aerospace engineer by training and Boeing lifer, has served as the planemaker's public face throughout the Max crisis. That's made him a target of critics who contend Boeing was too slow to fully explain the role its flight-control software played in the crashes that killed 346 people and prompted the global grounding in March.
The Max's design and safety face renewed scrutiny after the Seattle Times and New York Times published excerpts from a whistle-blower complaint filed internally by a Boeing engineer who helped design the Max's flight controls. Boeing tumbled 2.8% to $364.51 at 11:35 a.m. in New York after the reports, amid a broad market sell-off.
In the document, later shared with U.S. Justice Department investigators, Curtis Ewbank said his managers and Michael Teal, the 737 Max's chief project engineer, repeatedly rejected adding a safety backstop on the basis of cost and impact on pilot training. The synthetic airspeed system, used on Boeing's 787 Dreamliner, might have counteracted a sensor that malfunctioned in both crashes.
Muilenburg will face a grilling before Congress on Oct. 30, a year and a day after a Lion Air jet plunged into the Java Sea off the coast of Indonesia. An Ethiopian Airlines jet fell out of the sky less than five months later.
Inside Boeing, Muilenburg is carrying out a board-ordered revamp that gives directors an unfiltered view of concerns flagged by employees, while adding initiatives of his own to sharpen the focus on safety.
The overhaul is "a very clear note that the board is paying very, very close attention and monitoring things," said Jim Schrager, professor of entrepreneurship and strategy at the University of Chicago's Booth School of Business.
"Dennis has, and has always had, the full, unequivocal and enthusiastic support of the Boeing board of directors," the company's lead outside director, David Calhoun, said in a statement.
Muilenburg has been "incredibly supportive" of the board's new Aerospace Safety Committee, said Edmund Giambastiani, a Boeing director who will lead the oversight panel. "Dennis has the board's confidence," he said in an interview Sept. 25.
Boeing has taken to heart the aerospace industry's tradition of studying tragedies for ways to make flying safer, Muilenburg said in the interview at Boeing's Chicago headquarters. But he reiterated Boeing's oft-repeated refrain that there was no breakdown in the design and testing of the software feature known as MCAS that was implicated in both tragedies.
A report by the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board said Boeing classified MCAS's risk of failure as "major," the second-lowest of four hazard assessments. In addition, the manufacturer failed to conduct simulator testing of failure modes, like a broken angle-of-attack vane, that could potentially confuse pilots with multiple alarms.
"While that accident investigation and all the work we've been doing has been deep and intensive, we haven't found anything there that I would characterize as a problem or issue we're trying to solve," Muilenburg said. "Rather, when we look across what we've learned from both accidents, we always identify areas where we can improve."
In addition to the board oversight panel, Boeing is establishing a new product and services safety organization, which will have sweeping responsibility including investigating concerns raised anonymously by employees.
The head of the new unit, Beth Pasztor, will report to the board's safety committee as well as to Boeing's chief engineer, Greg Hyslop. Muilenburg is also restructuring Boeing's engineering corps. They will now report to Hyslop instead of business-unit managers.
In the background, Boeing is tackling the final technical work to persuade U.S. regulators to lift the grounding. While no date has been set, the company is discussing the timing of the crucial certification flight with U.S. officials, and Muilenburg says the process is in the "endgame." Boeing is working to clear the plane for service in the fourth quarter.
Regulatory approval would be followed by the logistical challenges of putting hundreds of airplanes back in the sky after months in storage -- and eventually nursing the Max's 600-company supply chain back to working at full-speed.
Prior to the grounding, the 737 program generated about 35% of Boeing's operating profit and cash flow, and 30% of the planemaker's revenue, according to Bloomberg Intelligence estimates.
"If you're Dennis, the program that matters absolutely the most to you beyond any other at the company is the 737," said George Ferguson, an analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence. "You have to get that right."
Boeing shares have rallied over the past six weeks on the first signs of the Max's re-entry into commercial market. Since closing at $320.42 on Aug. 14, the stock had risen 17% through Tuesday, the best performance of the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
But the profit Boeing is able to reap from the Max will ultimately hinge on the willingness of flight crews and travelers to set aside months of deep anxiety and bruising publicity surrounding a keystone of Boeing's future, said Schrager, the University of Chicago professor.
"The great unknown is how they fix this," he said, "and whether the 737 goes back into the world again as one of the safest airplanes ever made."

Texto completo: The Tokyo 2020 Olympics are almost here – and if you're going to the games next summer, or simply want to soak up the Olympics-tinged atmosphere, you should start planning your journey.
You probably have a lot of questions. But no need to fret, dear travelers: We're here to answer everything we can.
Here's a guide to all your Tokyo-related travel questions ahead of the 2020 Olympics:
When are the Olympics? July 24 to Aug. 9. U.S. travelers can still get a ticket, but only as part of a package. CoSport, the U.S. Olympics tickets retailer, is sold out of individual tickets but is waiting to see if it will receive more. You can sign up for their email list.Packages are available on its website that include tickets and hotel accommodation. One cheaper price, for a doubles trip, is $4,471.50 per person (for a three-night, four-event package from July 27-30).
But you might want to hurry up: "Packages are still available but are running scarce," Patricia Sweeney, a CoSport customer care associate told USA TODAY in an email.
When should I book flights for the Tokyo Olympics? There are always deals to be had, according to Darci Valiente, a U.S. flight searcher for Scott's Cheap Flights. Valiente recommends booking at least six months in advance. "Because it's for the Olympics, prices will be even more expensive than they already are for peak travel season," Valiente told USA TODAY.
Catherine Heald, CEO and co-founder of Asia tour operator Remote Lands, recommends flying into Haneda Airport as it's closest to the city center. Tokyo's other airport is Narita International Airport.
How much should people expect to pay? Valiente recommends looking for flights under $800, depending on where they are in the U.S.
And don't necessarily set your sights on flying directly into Tokyo. "We saw flights to Osaka for peak summer more (numerous) than Toyko – so be flexible about where you fly into and consider taking the train," Valiente says.
Marian Goldberg, The New York Times Travel Show Japan travel expert, recommends booking through a Japanese or Chinese travel agency if you're connecting from Beijing or Shanghai.
Right now, flight prices are more expensive if you want to be in Tokyo for the first few days of the games and the opening ceremony, according to Valiente. The prices drop in the middle to the end of the games. Travelers looking to make a 10- to 14-day excursion may want to stagger their journey so they arrive early and leave in the middle of the games, or arrive in the middle of the games and depart post-Olympics.
Where should I stay? Travelers have a number of options, including opting for a nearby city like Yokohama, which Amy Tadehara, a senior travel consultant at Inside Japan Tours, refers to as "Tokyo's cosmopolitan younger sibling." Hop on a train between the two in less than 40 minutes.
Edward Granville, chief operating officer at luxury travel company Red Savannah recommends booking with one of the event's official travel partners and says that the best hotels usually give up their inventory to these groups.
"Despite a construction boom in preparation to the Olympics, Tokyo is looking at a massive accommodation shortfall," Japan event travel expert Alan Omlin and long-time Tokyo resident says. The Mizuho Research Institute points to a 14,000-room shortfall for the city.
Airbnb has a reduced presence in the city thanks to a law restricting Airbnb rentals. Michael Matsuo, a spokesperson for Airbnb, said some hosts haven't made their calendars open to book yet – though a search during the Olympics period for one guest warranted more than 300 places to stay, varying wildly in price.
If you decide to book a hotel, know that most Japanese hotels don't let more than three (or even two) people in one room. Rooms are also more expensive, according to Goldberg. "In fact, all Japanese-style accommodations charge per person and not per room," Goldberg says.
Chef Hiroki Odo, owner and chef of o.d.o by ODO, the speakeasy kaiseki restaurant in New York's Flatiron neighborhood, recommends a ryokan (traditional Japanese inn).
Besides the Olympics, what should I do in Tokyo? Shibuya Crossing Who knew a crosswalk could double as a tourist attraction? But Shibuya Crossing could be the world's busiest, according to Lonely Planet, noting that at peak times upwards of 3,000 people cross at a time. It's a scramble intersection, which means all vehicle traffic is stopped to allow pedestrians to cross in every direction, including diagonally, at the same time.
Mount Fuji Although Mount Fuji technically isn't in Tokyo, it's just a short car, bus or train ride to the active volcano, which is also Japan's tallest mountain. Visitors can explore trails from early July to early September.
Animal cafes Tokyo has developed a worldwide reputation for its animal cafes. In addition to getting food and drink, visitors to the cafe are treated to interaction with cute, tame animals, such as hedgehogs, meerkats and ferrets. It's a dream come true for animal lovers.
Other notable sights Takao Nishina, travel agency GetYourGuide's regional manager for Japan, recommends the Tokyo Skytree, the tallest broadcast tower in the world, as well as the Ghibli Museum for animation fanatics and the Samurai Museum.
What else should I do? Hakone: "Tucked up in the mountains, it's a beautiful hideaway with a gondola that goes up into the mountains and a boat ride tour that sails the gorgeous Ashino Lake," Jay Allen, the publisher of website Unseen Japan, told USA TODAY. Tadehara from Inside Japan Tours says that Hakone's elevation is a pleasant break from Tokyo's summer heat.
Kyoto: Travelers can take a bullet train to "the cultural heart of Japan," Tadehara says. Nearly 2,000 temples and shrines are in the city.
Osaka or Hiroshima: Tadehara adds that you can take a day trip to see foodie haven Osaka or even Hiroshima, where the first atomic bomb dropped.
Yokohama: Check out Minato Mirai, a portside area that has "spectacular fireworks" in the summer, according to Allen.
Kamakura: Go here to see Komachi-dori, "a rich shopping section filled with small shops and restaurants; the Great Buddha of Kamakura at the Kotoku Temple, which has been preserved from the 13th century until today; and the oceanside shoreline of Kamakura which offers spectacular sunsets," Allen says.
Getting around The city is easy to get around via public transportation, though taxis are an affordable option. "Taxis are easy to get, most take credit cards, and they can be used affordably for short distances within a neighborhood," Goldberg says. "It's just really expensive to take a taxi to transfer between distant regions."

Texto completo: Democrats have been listening; now it's time for Republicans to do the same
I'm baffled at The Hartford Courant's recent editorial [Sept. 29, Editorial, "The president's behavior raises serious questions. Do we all have the courage to ask them?"]. The editorial appears to give false credence that both sides are acting dishonestly when the truth is that Republicans have gone full-tilt attacking of facts, science and reason as a standard strategy, because they deem listening and negotiating as a weakness.
When I read "It's time for Democrats to listen seriously to what Republicans are saying," I spit out my coffee. How do you listen to people that refuse to reason? That ushered in this post-truth era? People that chant - or tacitly support chants of - "lock her up" or "Jews will not replace us?" How do you listen when they're supporting the Democratic National Committee's information being stolen during elections? How do you listen to those turning a blind eye or openly support the constant lying to Americans, such as when Press Secretary Sarah Sanders released a faked video in order to support their attack against a reporter? When caught, their standard reaction has been calling the free press "the enemy of the people," childlike name calling or openly lying to reporters.
Now, President Trump has been caught red-handed, even admitting on TV in his hubris, to an illegal use of power. And his supporters go to the same playbook, obfuscate and avoid reason.
Democrats have plenty of demons but they've been listening plenty. Now it's time for Republicans to listen to reason and facts. Only then will the Republic work like it's supposed to.
Ben Rodriguez, Suffield
President Trump has every right to investigate Biden for corruption
The Hartford Courant continues to fail in presenting balanced reporting on matters concerning President Trump [Sept. 26, Nation "Whistleblower complaint alleges Trump sought election interference from Ukraine, then tried to cover it up"].
The latest edition of this concerns the telephone call between the presidents of the United States and Ukraine, in which it is alleged that President Trump pressured Ukrainian President Zelensky to dig up dirt on Joe Biden. What The Courant hasn't presented is that it is the President's duty, as the Commander in Chief, to seek truth and justice in matters regarding the nation. Additionally, in his phone call to Zelensky, Trump asked him to look into Ukrainian involvement in the Russian collusion narrative, a topic that has consumed and distracted the nation for the last two years.
On a second item of justice, Trump briefly asked Zelensky to look into the Joe Biden matter. Former Vice President Bides successfully threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. loan guarantees to Ukraine if they did not fire Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin of Ukraine. He is on tape saying, "If the prosecutor is not fired, you're not getting the money." At the time the prosecutor was investigating the gas company Burisma and Joe Biden's son for corruption. Burisma paid Hunter Biden "as much as $50,000 per month," as reported by the New York Times, to sit on their board when he had no expertise to do so. This potential selling of the vice presidential office to benefit his son was brought to light by the New York Times in 2015 [Dec. 8, 2015, "Joe Biden, His Son and the Case Against a Ukrainian Oligarch"] as well as the Wall Street Journal [Dec. 7, 2015, "Ukrainians See Conflict in Biden's Anticorruption Message"]. Running for president does not give Joe Biden immunity from investigation for corruption.

Texto completo: "THE WATER DANCER" By Ta-Nehisi Coates. One World ($28)
Being an effective fiction writer is not always an easy switch for writers who have mastered nonfiction. In the case of Ta-Nehisi Coates, an essayist and journalist who happens to also be a leading public intellectual on race, the switch was a bit clunky but effective nonetheless.
In Mr. Coates' debut novel, "The Water Dancer," he manages to create a mystical journey that explores the depths of loss when familial bonds are severed during slavery. The novel also forces a deeper examination of the racial caste system and the interdependency of blacks and whites in slavery.
The layers of intergenerational pain and the cruelty of existing in a world where the Tasked have no control over their place in that world are on full display in the novel. As the novel's narrator, Hiram Walker, describes, ". being born into a world of forbidden victuals and tantalizing untouchables - the land around you, the clothes you hem, the biscuits you bake. You bury the longing, because you know where it must lead."
Hiram and some of the other characters are blessed with very contemporary-feeling vocabulary, which makes the reader think very differently about how people can tell their own stories. That includes Mr. Coates' own use of fresher terminology. Instead of relying on the familiar terms of slave and master, in the world of "The Water Dancer," slaves are referred to as the Tasked, while masters are called Quality.
While "Dancer" is not Mr. Coates' first turn into the magical realm of fiction - he got his feet wet when he began penning the ongoing Black Panther comic book series a few years ago - it is clear that he's borrowed much from one of his literary idols, the late Toni Morrison.
"The Water Dancer" explores themes of remembrance and memory akin to Ms. Morrison's work. Its mysticism is an homage to her. In some places, maybe too much so. Particularly the beginning of the novel where it is hard to follow the story. It is too easy to get lost, not because you are swept up in a compelling story, but because you are lost in a thick text.
As easy as it is to get lost in Mr. Coates' text, the same could be true of how Americans get lost in the bombast of the country's greatness so much so that we ignore its ugliness. At one point in the novel, Hiram talks about white men who keep their children enslaved, ". It was never pure. Ain't no pure and it is we [the Tasked] who are blessed, for we know this. . I would live down here among my losses, among the muck and mess of it, before I would ever take a place among those who are in their own kind of muck but are so blinded by it they fancy it pure."
Ugly is too soft a word to describe slavery in America, but what is worse is the lack of acceptance and full understanding of the pain and suffering slavery inflicted on generations of black people in America. How as a system it questioned and quantified the very humanity of black people. It birthed a legacy of other systems that continue to hinder and destroy progress for the black descendants of slaves. Americans have mythologized its ugly past, so it feels not out of sorts that "The Water Dancer" also takes on a mythological angle in the telling of its story. Or, it could be that Mr. Coates is simply expanding upon his love of comic books and the fantasy realm.
Soon after the opening chapter, Mr. Coates hits his stride and Hiram finds his footing. Hiram is enslaved at the beginning of the novel and eventually ends up working for the Underground Railroad. Hiram has a perfect memory, but he has blocked out the most painful memory - the day his mother was taken away. She returns in the beginning of the book as an apparition just before Hiram and his half-brother, Maynard, plunge into the river below, killing Maynard and nearly drowning Hiram.
Memory is at the heart of the novel. It's a need for Americans to remember and recognize slavery for all that it was, all that it did and continues to do, and to reconcile our roles in it. That reconciliation also includes remembering one's ancestors as a source of strength even if that memory is painful.
"The Water Dancer" is a satisfying, if not the most captivating, read. Mr. Coates knows how to use language to evoke strong feelings in people. Through a work of fiction, Mr. Coates still manages to examine the legacies of slavery that exist today as he has done through his essays and nonfiction works for years.

When Trump Gets His Alligator

Texto completo: If Watergate became, for Richard Nixon, a cancer on his presidency, then Donald Trump's Ukraine scandal is shaping up as something different: It's an alligator in his White House.
The alligator, for readers who missed its recent moment in the news cycle, is the predatory beast that the president reportedly wanted to swim hungrily in a moat along our southern border, sharing the waters with poisonous snakes, shadowed by spiked-tipped walls above.
But Alligator mississippiensis is also a useful condensed symbol of how the Trump administration has survived Trump's own deeply unpresidential conduct: Because most of the time, when the president asks for an alligator, the people around him figure out a way to make sure the sharp-toothed reptile doesn't actually show up.
Their strategies have been various. Sometimes the president says "alligator!" and you just ignore him, which is how you get the spectacle of the man notionally in charge of the executive branch shouting "treason!" at his enemies with no discernible result.
[ Listen to "The Argument" podcast every Thursday morning, with Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt. ]
The other day my colleague James Poniewozik wondered at the way that some of the president's defenders "seem to feel he should be treated like any person who watches TV news, gets worked up & blows off steam, not like a president making statements backed by the power of the US government." But this isn't just how his apologists regard him; it's how his subordinates often manage him, signaling through their actions that his statements really are just rage-tweets, that the power of the government is not in fact behind them.
Of course that approach doesn't always work; sometimes the president asks you something directly instead of just yelling into the social-media void. Then you need delaying strategies, a promise to look into it, an "alligator cost estimate" proposal that will unfortunately never make its way through the bureaucracy.
Or you can give him some other lizard -- ideally a gecko or a bearded dragon, but a Cuvier's dwarf caiman if you must -- and tell him, Here's the alligator you wanted, sir!
If the president thinks that voter fraud cost him the popular vote, you create a voter fraud commission that will subsequently dissolve. If the president wants a "Muslim ban" you settle on a dumb but modest travel ban that leaves most of the world's Muslim countries untouched. If the president wants a bargain with North Korea no matter the strategic cost, let him have a handshake in the DMZ. If the president wants to leave NAFTA, you come up with a way to keep the deal but tweak it and rename it.
And if all else fails -- well, sometimes you'll write up the alligator requisition orders and steal them off his desk.
The two biggest disasters in Trump's presidency have both been cases where these guardrails collapsed, and the president actually got his way in full. He actually fired James Comey, setting in motion the probe whose workings dominated his first term, and his Homeland Security apparatus actually separated thousands of migrant children from their families, creating the biggest moral scandal of his presidency.
But in other cases he has been protected by the "don't-give-him-the-alligator" operations all around him. Indeed, the ultimate fizzle of the Mueller report was possible because that report ended up documenting a president whose staff let him rant about obstructing justice, but then -- in Mueller's own words -- mostly "declined to carry out orders or accede to his requests."
With the Ukraine scandal, though, this protection has broken down again. (Not least because in Rudy Giuliani, Trump found an adviser even more enthusiastic about alligators than his boss.) The quest to get Ukraine's government to reopen an investigation that would touch the Biden family wasn't just a wish that Trump expressed; it was a policy objective that, however reluctantly and haphazardly, the U.S. government seems to have pursued. Trump's now-publicized conversation with the Ukrainian president was itself an act of foreign policy, not just a spitballing conversation, and, whatever its intentions, so was the delay of military aid. We can't see the full body of the alligator, but you can see it moving in the water; it's right there.
Now clearly people around Trump still believed that they weren't going all the way to Alligatortown with Rudy, and maybe when we see the full shape of things it will be clear that the president's men did actually prevent the most explicitly Biden-focused quid pro quo from taking shape. In which case there will be defenses of Trump that say, in effect: Look, he wanted an alligator, and we let one thrash around in the water for a while, but we always kept it on a leash.
I expect that will be the defense offered, eventually, by pained Republican senators voting to acquit -- that this was bad behavior but happily the president's diplomats kept things from reaching the level of an impeachable offense.
The only difficulty will be that Trumpland will probably spend the next few months making a different argument: Actually, alligators are great.

Celtics' Kanter says he was harassed outside mosque

Texto completo: New Boston Celtics center Enes Kanter said he was harassed outside of a Cambridge mosque Friday afternoon because of his political opposition to Turkey's president.
Kanter, a 6-11 Turkish basketball player signed by Boston this summer, posted a video to Twitter that showed him and teammate Tacko Fall outside the Islamic Society of Boston on Prospect Street, which is a short walk away from Inman Square. In the video, at least two men can be seen addressing Kanter. One of them holds a cellphone.
Kanter, who is expected to be Boston's starting center this season, is a vocal critic of Turkey's leader, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, previously referring to him as “the Hitler of our century." Erdogan has been accused of increasingly authoritarian tendencies. In the Friday video, the Celtics player indicates the two men are his fellow countrymen who support Erdogan.
“They're actually starting a fight outside of a mosque, pro-Erdogan people," he said in the video.
Later, in a phone interview with the Globe, Kanter said he had never seen the two men before and that they cursed at him, called him “traitor," indicated that he should not be here, and made an obscene gesture at him. He said that when he and Fall, a 7-foot-7 rookie, left Friday's prayer service, the men were waiting for him outside. There, the men caused a scene, yelling and screaming at him, Kanter said.
“I told you America, this is crazy," Kanter said in the video.
Kanter told the Globe that he has tried to stand up “for human rights, democracy, and freedom" and to bring awareness of “what's really going on in Turkey."
“I'm not going to back down," he said.
He called the harassment unacceptable and said he was shocked by the incident.
“It's a mosque, it's a house of God, this shouldn't happen," he said.
Kanter said he spoke with the Celtics' security after the incident. Messages left with the Celtics were not immediately returned Friday evening.
“I shouldn't be feeling uncomfortable or insecure while critiquing anyone, but unfortunately even in America they make me feel this insecurity — can you even imagine how people in Turkey feel?" Kanter said in a statement texted to the Globe Friday night.
A Cambridge police spokesman said the department had received no formal reports regarding the incident as of 6:15 p.m. Friday.
Kanter has drawn the ire of the Turkish government for his political dissidence throughout his eight-year NBA career.
Using language like “terrorist" and “coup," the local Turkish Consulate recently tried to shut down Kanter's 50th free basketball camp of the offseason, according to Kanter and his manager. Hosted at UMass Boston last Saturday, the camp went on as planned because university officials denied the consulate's request, they said.

Democratic donor and accused killer Ed Buck finally arrested: John Phillips

Texto completo: The state of California is home to some of the most infamous serial killers in U.S. history — from the Manson Family, to the Freeway Killers, all the way to the Grim Sleeper.
Well, another accused killer is now awaiting trial in California. This time it’s prolific Democratic donor and West Hollywood resident Ed Buck.
Buck was finally arrested by Los Angeles County Sheriff’s deputies and charged with operating a drug house, as well as providing methamphetamine to a 37 year-old man who suffered an overdose at Buck’s apartment.
This incident was the third known time a man suffered a meth overdose at Buck’s home. The previous two alleged victims, Gemmel Moore and Timothy Dean, did not survive.
Days later, the feds announced that they too would be prosecuting Buck — this time on one count of distribution of methamphetamine resulting in death.
At a press conference, U.S. Attorney Nick Hanna said investigators found 10 more victims, nine of whom said Buck, “administered drugs to them or strongly encouraged them to ingest narcotics as part of agreements to be compensated for sexual services.”
The case is now generating national and international headlines; and I’m noticing that three false storylines seem to be emerging, and they need to be corrected.
First, The New York Times tried to minimize Buck’s power and influence by referring to him as “a small-time Democratic donor and political activist.”
That’s like calling Harvey Weinstein a “love-sick teenager.”
According to federal records, Buck has contributed more than $500,000 to Democratic candidates and groups, and was classified by the California Secretary of State’s office as being a “major donor.”
Before he was nicknamed ‘Dr. Kevorkian’ by his West Hollywood neighbors, Buck could have easily gone by Ed ‘Big Bucks’ with all of the campaign cash he was throwing around.
Second, it has been reported in multiple publications that the politicians and political action committees who took contributions from Buck acted quickly to distance themselves from him.
Some politicians, including former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and former President Obama, still won’t say what they’re doing with Buck’s donations, even after his arrest.
In her defense, Hillary may not even know that Buck has been arrested. If she did, she might have fainted again.
Other candidates, including Congressman Adam Schiff, D-Burbank, and Ted Lieu, D-Torrance, agreed to give their Buck contributions of $2,700 and $19,400 respectively, to charity, only after the second man, Timothy Dean, died in Buck’s apartment in January.
The families of the victims, asked for the contributions to help pay for funeral expenses, but both congressmen declined.
What profiles in courage.
To date, only two elected officials donated the money they received from Buck to the victims’ families. Congresswoman Karen Bass, D-Los Angeles, sent the entire $250 she received from Buck to help pay for Gemmel Moore’s funeral expenses, and West Hollywood Councilman John D’Amico made a $25 contribution toward the funeral.
Finally, Los Angeles County District Attorney Jackie Lacey claimed that her office worked diligently and carefully to find and speak with witnesses over the course of the last two years so they could build a case against Ed Buck.
But the Moore family attorneys say the opposite is true. Nana Gyamfi and Hussain Turk wrote in a statement that, “Our team of activists had to personally escort witnesses to the LASD’s office and pressure them into recording our witnesses’ statements. We later discovered, in May of 2019, that Lacey was not even aware that these reports existed.”
Maybe prosecutors were too busy busting people for possession of plastic drinking straws to go after Ed Buck.
The reality is that Ed Buck abused vulnerable gay black men because powerful people looked the other way and enabled him.
Now that he’s finally been arrested, we shouldn’t try to minimize his power and influence, or rewrite history to make law enforcement and politicians seem as if they cared about the suffering of Ed Buck’s victims more than they actually did.
John Phillips can be heard weekdays from 6 a.m. to 10 a.m. on “The Morning Drive with John Phillips and Jillian Barberie” on KABC/AM 790.

Woman ‘consumed’ by Columbine and Oklahoma City killings had 24 pipe bombs, police say

Texto completo: A Florida woman obsessed with the Columbine High School massacre and the Oklahoma City bombing was arrested after her parents discovered two dozen pipe bombs in her bedroom, authorities said Friday.
The woman, Michelle Kolts, 27, was charged with 24 counts of making a destructive device with intent to harm, Chad Chronister, the sheriff of Hillsborough County, said at a news conference.
Kolts had been on the radar of authorities for more than a year, Chronister said.
A printing company had contacted his department in 2018 because Kolts had ordered “several” manifestos and “anarchist instructions,” the sheriff said, adding, “She became consumed with the Columbine and Oklahoma killings.”
In 1995, a homemade bomb planted outside a federal office building in Oklahoma City killed 168 people. The 1999 Columbine shooting, in which two gunmen killed 13 and wounded 21 in Littleton, Colorado, has “infatuated” some young people and prompted copycat shootings across the country.
“While checking Michelle’s bedroom, her parents found what appeared to be a significant amount of pipe bombs, other bomb-making materials and numerous weapons,” Chronister said. Her parents, who were in the military, called authorities Thursday, he said.
When police arrived, they evacuated the home, in Wimauma, Florida, about 30 miles south of Tampa, and called the bomb squad.
Police discovered 24 pipe bombs, smokeless pistol powder, fuse material, 23 different knives, two hatchets, two BB-pellet-type rifles, six BB-pellet-type handguns and dozens of books and DVDs about murder, mass killing, domestic terrorism and bomb making, Chronister said.
“The amount of highly destructive materials we found in this home were astonishing,” he said, adding, “If used, these bombs could have caused catastrophic damage and harm to hundreds, even thousands of people.”
Police found Kolts at her job, he said. Arrest records listed her occupation as laborer, but no additional details were available. Kolts admitted to detectives that she made the devices and had planned to use them, though it was unclear how, the sheriff said.
Kolts was being held with bail set at $180,000. Records showed no lawyer listed for her and attempts to reach her parents Saturday were unsuccessful.
“Who knows the amount of harm that could have been done, or how many lives could have been lost, had these parents not found the courage to call the sheriff’s office and seek help,” Chronister said.

Texto completo: President Donald Trump tore into Sen. Mitt Romney on Twitter on Saturday, calling the 2012 Republican presidential nominee "pompous" a day after Romney said Trump's apparent requests of Ukraine and China to investigate a political opponent were "wrong and appalling. "
"Mitt Romney never knew how to win," tweeted Trump, who has often slammed the Utah Republican for his failure to defeat President Barack Obama. He said Romney "has been fighting me from the beginning, except when he begged for my endorsement for his Senate run (I gave it to him), and when he begged me to be Secretary of State (I didn't give it to him). He is so bad for R's!"
On Friday, Romney derided Trump's call for China to investigate vague corruption allegations against former Vice President Joe Biden. Trump's suggestion came amid an impeachment inquiry into his attempts to get Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate allegations that Biden forced a Ukrainian prosecutor to back off an energy company with ties to his son.

Mitt Romney never knew how to win. He is a pompous “ass” who has been fighting me from the beginning, except when he begged me for my endorsement for his Senate run (I gave it to him), and when he begged me to be Secretary of State (I didn’t give it to him). He is so bad for R’s!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 5, 2019
Trump and his supporters have denied that his requests for foreign governments to investigate the 2020 Democratic presidential candidate were politically motivated. They have said Trump was instead focused on battling corruption.
"When the only American citizen President Trump singles out for China’s investigation is his political opponent in the midst of the Democratic nomination process, it strains credulity to suggest that it is anything other than politically motivated," Romney tweeted.
"By all appearances, the President’s brazen and unprecedented appeal to China and to Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden is wrong and appalling," he added.

"Somebody please wake up Mitt Romney and tell him that my conversation with the Ukrainian President was a congenial and very appropriate one, and my statement on China pertained to corruption, not politics," Trump tweeted in response on Saturday. "If Mitt worked this hard on Obama, he could have won. Sadly, he choked!"
The president also repeated his assertion that his conversation with Zelensky was a "perfect phone call" and that the whistleblower who helped spark the impeachment inquiry was "way off" in his characterization of that was said. Although many experts and commentators have said a rough transcript of the call that was released by Trump helps corroborate the allegations against him, the president also repeated his claim that the transcript exonerated him.

Romney has been a fierce critic of Trump since the 2016 Republican primary campaign. Though Romney was not a candidate that year, he was a leading voice among Republicans who hoped to stop Trump from securing the nomination, calling him a "phony" and a "fraud" whose "personal qualities would mean that America would cease to be a shining city on a hill. "
Trump responded to that criticism by calling Romney a "failed candidate" who "ran one of the worst races in presidential history" and "choked like a dog. "
Failed candidate Mitt Romney,who ran one of the worst races in presidential history,is working with the establishment to bury a big "R" win!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 3, 2016
Mitt Romney had his chance to beat a failed president but he choked like a dog. Now he calls me racist-but I am least racist person there is
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 11, 2016
Their relationship improved after Trump's 2016 victory and Romney was considered a top contender for secretary of state as Trump assembled his Cabinet. And Trump backed Romney in his 2018 Senate run, tweeting that he would "make a great Senator" and that he "had my full support and endorsement. "
. @MittRomney has announced he is running for the Senate from the wonderful State of Utah. He will make a great Senator and worthy successor to @OrrinHatch, and has my full support and endorsement!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 20, 2018
But ahead of his swearing-in as senator, Romney wrote an op-ed in The Washington Post that said, "the president has not risen to the mantle of the office. "
"Here we go with Mitt Romney, but so fast!" Trump responded. "Would much prefer that Mitt focus on Border Security and so many other things where he can be helpful. I won big, and he didn’t. He should be happy for all Republicans. Be a TEAM player & WIN!"
As to whether Romney "begged" for that endorsement, the former Massachusetts governor did boast about the president's support in a 2018 tweet.
However, Trump had relatively low popularity in Utah where he only received about 14% of the vote in the 2016 Republican caucuses, according to The New York Times. And though Trump won Utah with 45% of the vote in the 2016 general election, 21% of voters went with independent candidate Evan McMullin, who ran as a conservative alternative to Trump. Romney won the state with almost 73% of the vote in 2012.
Perilous times for Trump: By 45%-38%, Americans support impeaching him over Ukraine allegations, poll finds

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry has quietly decided to resign his position and leave Washington by the end of the year — a decision sources say he made well before being drawn into the Ukraine controversy that is central to the impeachment investigation of President Donald Trump.
“He plans to leave the administration soon,” a GOP source told the American-Statesman. “This has been in the works for a while, before the impeachment announcement from (House Speaker Nancy) Pelosi.”
An Energy Department spokeswoman declined to directly address reports of Perry’s departure, which
was first reported by Politico and The New York Times.
“While the Beltway media has breathlessly reported on rumors of Secretary Perry's departure for months, he is still the secretary of energy and a proud member of President Trump’s Cabinet,” spokeswoman Shaylyn Hynes said.
“One day the media will be right. Today is not that day,” Hynes said.
Perry, 69, who spent 14 years as Texas governor before leaving office in 2015, was among Trump's first Cabinet selections despite a contentious relationship while both were vying for the 2016 GOP presidential nomination.
Responding to Trump's criticism of his border policies as governor, Perry said during the campaign, “What Mr. Trump is offering is not conservatism, it is Trumpism — a toxic mix of demagoguery and nonsense.”
But, after mending fences with Trump, Perry was sworn in as energy secretary in March 2017, taking over the department he had famously forgotten when he tried to list agencies he wanted to eliminate during a presidential debate in 2012.
A low-key Cabinet member who had promised to promote U.S. energy and press for deregulation, Perry avoided scandals like those that forced the resignations of Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt.
“Rick Perry’s successful tenure as secretary of energy will allow him to end his 35-year political career on a high note, something that would not have been the case had Perry’s unsuccessful 2016 presidential bid been the last act of an extraordinary political career,” said Mark Jones, a Rice University political science professor.
“He’s done a really good job promoting U.S. energy exports around the world and promoting the value of the national lab program, getting Congress to provide research funding,” said U.S. Rep. Bill Flores, R-Bryan, a former energy executive. “Most people assumed he’d stay for two to three years.”
U.S. Rep. Chip Roy, R-Austin, who worked for Perry when he was governor and was the ghostwriter of Perry’s 2010 book, “Fed Up!” said: “He’s done a great job, as anyone who knows him would expect. He’s been a strong advocate for robust, available, affordable energy of all types.”
Environmental activists see Perry differently, criticizing his promotion of coal over renewable energy as the Trump administration withdrew from the Paris Climate Agreement in 2017 and his August interview with Fox News, when Perry said Democrats “live in a fantasy world” with their warnings about climate change.
“He absolutely took the country backwards on energy policy,” said John Coequyt, the Sierra Club's global climate policy director.
Perry’s meetings with Ukrainian officials have drawn recent scrutiny, raising his profile as House Democrats have launched an impeachment inquiry after Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy for help investigating a political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden.
A whistleblower complaint that led to the inquiry noted that Perry led a U.S. delegation to the May inauguration of Zelenskiy after Trump stopped Vice President Mike Pence from attending.
On Tuesday, U.S. Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., sent a letter asking Perry if he had carried any messages from Trump to Zelenskiy, particularly about any investigations involving Biden or his son, Hunter.
As for Perry’s future, friends and associates say they expect him to return to Texas — he has a home in Round Top — and to work on corporate boards and serve as a senior statesman in GOP politics.
“He’s had a long and illustrious career,” said Austin political consultant Bill Miller, who has clients in both parties. “In my opinion, he wants to enjoy his life and his grandkids.”

Texto completo: I'm a lipstick-wearing, red-meat-eating, Diet Coke-drinking, heterosexual, cisgender patriotic American feminist of Sicilian and French-Canadian descent who can recite both "Who's On First?" and "Little Women" in their entirety without breaking a sweat.
I don't like beer, scented candles, pie or sports, I prefer cats to dogs and I drive a classic non-fuel-efficient convertible, which my husband of 28 years and I often take to the casino. I believe in a woman's right to choose and hope that God loves me, even though I'm not sure I believe God exists in the first place.
So what part of that made you want to throw me into the alligator moat?
It was preferring cats to dogs, wasn't it?
Here's what I have to guard against doing these days: I sweep too swiftly past a cursory acknowledgement of differences between people in search of consecrating divisions. I find myself gathering up reasons to distinguish my own clan from rival ones as if I'm working a pyramid scheme in reverse. I'm an omnivore; she's a vegetarian. I'm letting our differences define us.
How can she NOT understand this point I'm making? What is WRONG with her? She, of course, is thinking the same about me. Or at least, that's what I fear - I am, I suppose, easy to judge, if you're so inclined.
Is it surprising, then, that I hesitate to discuss significant issues with those whose viewpoints I don't think align with my own? Even when we're on the same side, we can end up yelling at each other with a level of viciousness usually reserved for drivers vying for the same parking space if one piece of their worldview seems slightly askew.
Political discourse has become an oxymoron; nothing is off-limits; rhetoric has been replaced by rock-throwing. Everything encourages us to regard those who aren't with us as against us, and to judge them as treasonous, sinister, desperate or - dare I say? - deplorable.
Then I - and we, yes, I'm going with "we" - unearth justifications for our point of view the way hounds hunt for bones. (It's not that I don't like dogs, you see; it's just that I really like cats.) It's not enough to feel we're right: we want to prove we're right, to ourselves as much as to anyone else (maybe more so). That's why we find ourselves becoming positively evangelical about things we know are none of our business, such as who eats what and who sleeps with whom.
Our beliefs define us. And who wants to be undefined in today's world? So we scrape together convenient truths and build our identities out of them.
A recent New York Times article by Gina Kolata, for example, follows the uproar over new scientific evidence suggesting that, despite years of being lectured about the damage a single sausage could cause our overall well-being, "an individual cannot conclude that he or she will be better off not eating red meat" based on existing studies.
Heads of major schools of medicine are weighing in; those studying the climate are weighing in; I'm weighing in (or to be more precise, weighing the locally farmed steaks we're grilling this weekend).
If we're in danger of losing our souls, it's not because of what we're putting into our mouths - it's because we're being driven by our guts and not our brains. We push away ideas that aren't form-fitted into our existing biases with the gesture a toddler uses to reject food she's never tasted. But as adults, we justify our uninformed instincts and hunker down in our original position, shaking our heads without noticing there's an empty sound where original thought should be.
When we encounter a space we haven't yet filled with bias and belief, it gets filled with alligators and other monsters, making us wary and frightened. We don't know where to find comfort. We don't know who counts as a true ally or a genuine friend. Lonely and bereft, we're tempted to become part of a mob just to be able to hang out with people.
It doesn't have to be that way.
Community calls for compromise and trust. I'll cook a vegan lasagna and somebody else can grill while, in the background, the baseball game plays, and your puppy runs in the yard, and people talk with curiosity about their politics and personal choices, unburdened by prefabricated groupthink. The devil, bored, goes searching for beer, while God - who may or may not exist - lies half-listening in the hammock. As I start reciting "Little Women," everybody quickly packs up to home.
It could be worse: There's actually plenty of beer.

PayPal Leaves Cryptocurrency Project, a New Blow to Facebook

Texto completo: SAN FRANCISCO -- PayPal said on Friday that it had pulled out of the coalition of companies involved in a Facebook-backed cryptocurrency initiative, in the latest headache for the social network's effort.
The proposed cryptocurrency, Libra, has been in the works at Facebook for more than a year and was announced to much fanfare in June. Libra was designed to function as a cryptocurrency that could be freely traded inside Facebook's properties, like Messenger and WhatsApp, and would be used for international exchange. At the time, Facebook said more than 27 corporate partners -- including PayPal, Visa, Mastercard and companies like Uber -- had pledged to support the project.
"PayPal has made the decision to forgo further participation in the Libra Association at this time and to continue to focus on advancing our existing mission and business priorities," a spokeswoman for PayPal, Amanda Coffee, wrote in an email on Friday.
A Facebook spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment. PayPal's move was earlier reported by The Wall Street Journal.
PayPal's decision is a blow to Facebook and its cryptocurrency ambitions, which are based on the premise that Libra will be controlled not by Facebook but by a broad network of corporate partners. The effort is the most far-reaching attempt by a mainstream company into the world of cryptocurrencies, with Facebook executives having detailed plans for how Libra could become the foundation for a new financial system not controlled by today's power brokers on Wall Street or central banks.
"It feels like it is time for a better system," David Marcus, head of Facebook's blockchain technology research, said in an interview in June. "This is something that could be a profound change for the entire world."
Yet the project encountered pitfalls almost immediately after it was announced. President Trump and other federal officials criticized the effort, with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin saying he was "very uncomfortable" about the plan. Many other politicians, regulators and central bankers around the world echoed their skepticism.
Lawmakers said the idea of introducing an unregulated currency showed that Facebook had not learned its lesson from past controversies, including its data privacy issues. In July, Mr. Marcus faced two days of questioning about Libra in Congress.
Many of Facebook's partners also quickly distanced themselves from the Libra project. Some had signed nonbinding agreements, knowing they weren't obliged to use or promote the digital token and could easily back out if they didn't like where the initiative was going, executives at seven of the partner companies told The New York Times in June.
Some partners were wary of how Facebook's issues with regulators around the world, including privacy and the uncertain legality of cryptocurrencies, might affect Libra. Many of the companies rely on good relationships with financial regulators. In back-room conversations, several partners have complained that Facebook did not do enough before announcing the project to get regulators comfortable with Libra.
"We will not do anything that we think doesn't meet our own personal standards, as well as the standards of regulators that we respect around the world," Al Kelly, Visa's chief executive, told CNBC this year.
The news that PayPal was the first to drop out is likely to carry a particular sting because Mr. Marcus used to be the president of PayPal.
As the latest news about disenchanted partners leaked out this week, Mr. Marcus took to Twitter to defend the Libra project and acknowledge the struggles it has faced.
"Change of this magnitude is hard and requires courage + it will be a long journey," he wrote on Tuesday. "For Libra to succeed it needs committed members."
Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook's chief operating officer, is expected to appear before the House Financial Services Committee on Oct. 29 to discuss Libra and accusations of housing discrimination on Facebook's ads platform, according to two people briefed on the plan.

Ms. Sandberg is set to be the only witness, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the plan was confidential. The event may change, as committee members also want to hear from Facebook's chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg.
If the hearing goes ahead, it will be Ms. Sandberg's first testimony to since September 2018, when she answered questions about election interference on Facebook and the social network's handling of user data.
Mr. Zuckerberg recently said in an interview that he was committed to making Libra happen. But he also said Facebook might not be able to push out the first Libra coins by next year, as the initial plan envisioned.
The Libra Association, a Swiss organization that Facebook created to oversee the project, is planning a meeting for partners in Geneva this month to formalize their participation. Even with PayPal's departure, 1,500 companies and other organizations have expressed an interest in becoming partners, said Dante Disparte, the association's head of policy and communications.
"The type of change that will reconfigure the financial system to be tilted towards people, not the institutions serving them, will be hard," Mr. Disparte said in a statement. "Commitment to that mission is more important to us than anything else. We're better off knowing about this lack of commitment now, rather than later."

Texto completo: At major arts organizations all over the world, a huge ripple effect is being absorbed and dealt with in a number of different ways. The ripple in question is an increasingly common awareness of the fact that some of the major industries their funders are involved with have not exactly done great things for the environment or for those who can’t count themselves among the one percent, which has led to the escalating sense that things have to change—and change fast. The uproar that led to the resignation of Whitney board member Warren B. Kanders is a perfect example.
What this movement means for the arts in general is rather complicated. On Wednesday, BBC News reported that the Royal Shakespeare Company would end its partnership with the “supermajor” oil and gas company BP after students threatened to boycott, marking a victory for climate activists and also indicating that going forward, arts funding is going to be increasingly heavily scrutinized.

This thesis is supported by the fact that this week, the New York Times published a rundown of the professions of 536 board members of America’s 10 most-attended museums. The article indicates that the top three sources of income found amongst these museum’s board members are finance, real estate and energy/oil and gas, with finance coming out well in the lead. “Forty percent of the more than 500 people who sit on the boards of America’s most popular art museums either work in the finance industry or derive their wealth from it,” the Times piece states.
For those even semi-familiar with how the art world operates in the 21st century, the fact that museum boards are stuffed with people in the finance industry isn’t necessarily a shock. However, what’s increasingly inarguable is that the sustainability of the art world itself is intrinsically intertwined with the fates of industries that more and more people are condemning as morally inexcusable.
In other words, if the banks are toppled and million-dollar properties are redistributed and behemoth oil companies are blacklisted, this also means that museums will have to fundamentally reevaluate their sources of funding. This is an admirable goal in the long run, but the art world in general simply doesn’t yet have a universal alternative to welcoming these types of financial backers.
Therefore, the tension between the organizational necessity of ample fiduciary support and backlash from the public is likely to continue to play out over and over again until someone comes up with a solution. As of right now, there isn’t a straightforward one.

Texto completo: Midvale • Rep. Ben McAdams on Friday offered his most direct assessment yet of the burgeoning impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump, saying that while he will not prejudge the outcome, a formal probe is necessary to determine the facts.
The show of support for an inquiry closed out a disorganized two-day period for the Utah Democrat, who on Thursday declined to comment on impeachment before releasing an ambiguous written statement, and then on Friday was prompted to clarify his position after first reading what he called the “wrong version” of prepared remarks as he visited a senior center.
“The president’s refusal to further cooperate with congressional oversight, without an impeachment inquiry, is regrettable ,” McAdams said Friday in his updated comments. “We find ourselves today at the point that an [impeachment] inquiry is necessary to get all of the facts on the table.”
But some in attendance at Friday’s event remained unsatisfied with McAdams’ comments and asked him to unequivocally state whether he would vote in support of impeaching the president. One woman, Sandy resident Jamie Zayach, interrupted McAdams at various points and followed him out of the room, pressing for additional comment.
“I want an answer,” Zayach said.
McAdams reiterated that while he supports a launch of the impeachment process, he will not stake a position on impeaching the president until that process concludes.
“I am not on the fence,” McAdams said. “It is my duty to allow this process to play out without partisanship and with impartiality.”
While the House has the power to impeach the president — an action analogous to a criminal indictment — the U.S. Senate is empowered to hold a trial and vote to either acquit or convict and remove the commander in chief from office.
House Democrats formally launched an impeachment inquiry last month after a whistleblower complaint accused Trump of urging the president of Ukraine to open an investigation into a top political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden, and accused White House staff of inappropriately acting to hide the content of that conversation.
Trump has defended his conversation with the Ukranian president as appropriate and on Thursday publicly encouraged China to launch its own investigation of Biden based on unsubstantiated corruption allegations.
Before Friday, McAdams had been reluctant to join his House Democratic colleagues in backing the inquiry, remarking on the need for impartiality but largely dodging reporters’ questions on whether he, individually, saw a need for a formal impeachment probe. The Associated Press listed him as one of six House Democrats not backing at least the investigation, while The New York Times said he was one of 10.
During a Thursday media event, McAdams directed questions on impeachment to his press secretary, Alyson Heyrend, who was dismissive when asked by reporters whether McAdams supported the House impeachment investigations.
“It doesn’t matter,” Heyrend said. “It’s underway.”
McAdams later issued a written statement stressing the need for congressional oversight and comparing his role to that of a juror in a court proceeding. That led to Friday’s town hall, where the freshman congressman took two attempts at stating his position before exiting the senior center amid shouts from constituents.
“The president’s actions yesterday, as well as allegations that he has abused his power and harmed our national security for his own personal gain, are serious,” McAdams said Friday in his first statement, “and they demand attention from Congress, where we have a constitutional duty to conduct oversight.”
McAdams had initially intended to not take questions from the media Friday, saying he preferred to focus on the scheduled topic for the town hall meeting: health and wellness.
“We have other work to do,” McAdams said, “and we can not allow this issue to paralyze a Washington that is already low on results.”
McAdams’ political position is unique in that he is the lone Democrat in Utah’s federal delegation, and one of a handful of congressional Democrats who represent predominantly Republican districts. In 2018, he narrowly won his election against then-Rep. Mia Love by fewer than 700 votes.
Quinn Monson, an associate professor of political science at Brigham Young University who consulted for Love, said McAdams’ reticence on the question of impeachment is understandable given the political makeup of the district.
And while some congressional Democrats have been reluctant to support impeachment, Monson said, some congressional Republicans have hedged in their support for Trump.
“The president is not making it easy for candidates in competitive districts on both sides of the aisle,” Monson said.
Monson said the dynamic facing McAdams is akin to a “Political Science 101” lesson, in that he’s facing conflicting pressures from House leadership, primary election voters and general election voters.
“Maybe he doesn’t want to be the last Democrat in Washington to announce his support,” Monson said.
Jim Curry, an associate political science professor at the University of Utah, said McAdams was already facing a hard reelection in 2020, which makes it difficult to predict how the impeachment issue will impact his standing in the race next year.
“No matter which way you come down,” Curry said, “you’re going to anger a large number of people.”

If Warren wins, former UN ambassador Samantha Power says she wouldn't 'rule out' a run for her Senate seat

Texto completo: PROVIDENCE — Former UN ambassador Samantha Power said Friday she would not rule out running for the US Senate seat held by Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren, should Warren be elected president.
Then again, she also said she wouldn't rule out the job of Sox general manager, a job that's actually open right now.
Power, who lives in Concord, came to Providence Friday to promote her new memoir, “The Education of an Idealist."
When asked whether she would rule out running for the Senate if Warren won the presidency, Power was coy. “No, no. I don't think it's a good idea to rule anything out," she said.
Power then quipped that she also “wouldn't rule out managing the Red Sox."
What prompted this exchange? Speaking at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin last weekend, she was pressed by an event moderator on the same question and had a similar response, according to two people in the room.
Those comments had not been previously reported.
In Providence on Friday for an appearance at the New England Independent Booksellers Association's annual gathering, she acknowledged the Texas conversation.
“What I said is I'm focused on promoting the book, and I'd love to serve again," Power said. “That is all I said."
Asked to clarify, she added: “I want to serve again. I've got to figure out how."
Power served in the Obama administration as US ambassador to the United Nations from 2013 to 2017. She won a Pulitzer Prize in 2003 for her book “A Problem from Hell." She now teaches at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government and at Harvard Law School, where her husband, Cass Sunstein, also teaches.
Warren, of course, formerly taught at the law school, and her own husband, Bruce Mann, is currently a professor.
Power said these days she is busy promoting her book.
“I'm really, really focused on what I'm doing now," she said. “And I have two small kids who I am making up for lost time with."
A year out from the 2020 election, the Democratic field remains crowded, though Warren has emerged as a formidable candidate.
And the jump from UN ambassador to the US Senate has happened before.
Daniel Patrick Moynihan served briefly in the role before being elected a New York senator in 1976. Earlier this year, Susan Rice, another former UN ambassador in the Obama administration, flirted with a run against Senator Susan Collins next year, a Republican in Maine.

Texto completo: JEFFERSON CITY -- A St. Louis-based company that contributed to a committee supporting Attorney General Eric Schmitt's election will not disclose anything about itself.
The EC I Fund donated $10,000 on Tuesday to the MO Opportunity PAC, which was formed in support of Schmitt's 2020 election bid.
"We cannot comment as to EC I Fund LLC, its owners, or its activities," Patricia Bland, a St. Louis lawyer whose name is listed on state forms, said in an email.
State records and interviews connect the fund to P. Joseph McKee III, the son of developer Paul McKee Jr., whose NorthSide Regeneration had recently been entangled in a state lawsuit alleging tax credit fraud.
The contribution represents a fraction of the more than $670,000 the MO Opportunity PAC has secured this year, but it raises questions about whether the attorney general's office can, or should, wall off Schmitt from cases that may involve EC I Fund officials -- especially if the identities of those officials are unknown.
Schmitt, a Republican, will likely face Democrat Elad Gross in the November 2020 general election; Gross has pledged not to accept corporate money.
"The Attorney General's Office has a strong conflict of interest policy, and we work every day to be as professional and ethical as possible," Chris Nuelle, spokesman for the attorney general's office, said in an email.
He directed further questions to Schmitt's campaign. Three campaign officials did not return multiple phone calls. Carl Struby, treasurer of the MO Opportunity PAC, said he wasn't authorized to speak to the media and hung up the phone.
The EC I Fund has made political contributions in the past.
Sen. Eric Burlison, R-Nixa, received $2,600 from the fund when he was running for state Senate last year.
"The person I got it from was Joe McKee," he told the Post-Dispatch.
P. Joseph McKee III is the CEO of Paric Corp., a St. Louis construction company.
Schmitt's office settled with the elder McKee's company, NorthSide Regeneration, in June for $323,930 and agreed not to pursue future claims against the developer for its use of a now-lapsed tax credit. The lawsuit originally sought repayment of $2.6 million in tax credits.
Schmitt's campaign in March accepted a $2,600 contribution from LB Eckelkamp, a frequent GOP donor, and executive at the Bank of Washington in Franklin County. The Bank of Washington is one of NorthSide Regeneration's largest creditors.
Burlison said he didn't remember whether the younger McKee was in charge of the EC I Fund or was just tied to it. Regardless, Burlison said he wrote in his ledger he needed to send McKee a thank you note.
McKee did not respond to two requests for comment.
In 2018, a Joe McKee donated to state Sen. Bill Eigel, R-Weldon Spring, using the same Clayton address "165 N Maramec (sic)" as EC I Fund, according to ethics commission records.
Eigel said the McKee he accepted a contribution from was the CEO of Paric, P. Joseph McKee III.
Paul Joseph McKee III donated $500 directly to Schmitt's campaign in November 2018, records show.
Besides the Burlison check, EC I Fund has made three contributions since its formation in 2016: $2,500 for former Gov. Eric Greitens' campaign in 2016; $4,600 in February 2018 to CL PAC, which has become the political contribution vehicle for World Wide Technology Chairman David Steward; and $5,000 to the campaign of former St. Louis County Executive Steve Stenger in April 2018.
CONFLICT OF INTEREST
Former Attorney General Chris Koster, a Democrat, announced a conflict-of-interest policy after a New York Times investigation in 2014 found his office demonstrated a pattern of easing up on companies that had donated to his campaign.
The policy banned contributions from entities under investigation by the attorney general's office. A 2015 audit found the state agency had not formally adopted the policy.
Koster's campaign for governor, meanwhile, said then it had "implemented the most stringent conflict of interest policy of any Attorney General in the nation."
It relied on donors to self-report whether they were under investigation. Schmitt's campaign, which is separate from the MO Opportunity PAC, said Thursday that it asks donors to certify that they are not under investigation.
An attorney general's office deputy said in the 2015 audit it was unrealistic to expect a campaign to police the issue because only the attorney general's office knows what it is investigating.
Nuelle, Schmitt's spokesman, said the office's current policy is the same as Koster's and includes additional safeguards added under former Attorney General Josh Hawley, he said.
The proliferation of PACs complicates the creation of conflict of interest policies -- the donations to MO Opportunity PAC aren't directly tied to Schmitt.
Schmitt has a campaign account, but in 2016, voters limited contributions to the traditional accounts to $2,600.
Big-dollar contributions now flow to PACs, not campaigns. Candidates cannot form, control or direct the committees, but their campaigns can coordinate fundraising efforts.
The Post-Dispatch reported in July that the MO Opportunity PAC received $2,500 from the pro-cannabis Relax PAC, whose leadership includes some of the biggest players in the state's medical marijuana industry.
The attorney general's office would defend the state in any lawsuits filed by companies that don't win medical marijuana business licenses later this year.
If any disputes were connected to Relax PAC leadership, Nuelle said the office's conflict of interest policy might kick in to wall Schmitt off from the case.
"The attorney general's office will wall off lawyers if necessary under our conflict of interest policy, including the AG."
HIDING CONTRIBUTIONS
Limited-liability company registrations have ballooned since 1994, when the secretary of state recorded 2,289 new LLCs, or 12% of all new companies that year.
In 2013, limited-liability companies made up 89% of all new business registrations, with 41,762 new LLCs that year, according to a 2014 report.
LLCs protect their owners from personal liability. They allow secrecy and are often used in real estate transactions. Greitens, for example, used the LLC J & J Escape to purchase his Innsbrook Resort lake home in Warren County.
Lawyers or others can register with the secretary of state, leaving company owners off of public records.
The EC I Fund's attorney, Bland, listed the location of her Clayton law firm -- Paule, Camazine & Blumenthal P.C. -- as the fund's address.
Bland registered with the state on Sept. 8, 2016. She listed National Corporate Research, now Cogency Global, as the fund's registered agent.
In 2018, the EC I Fund's address was changed to 9666 Olive Boulevard in St. Louis County, the same address as Cogency Global.
Cogency, on its website, says it assists companies with state paperwork. Companies like Cogency often appear on paperwork as a company's registered agent, not an actual company owner.
Missouri law forbids donations made in "such a manner as to conceal the identity of the actual source of the contribution."
Greitens, a Republican, faced allegations in May 2018 that he accepted money from so-called "shell companies" in order to illegally conceal donor identities.
At the time, a Missouri House committee investigating the governor did not focus on or mention the EC I Fund's $2,500 contribution to Greitens' campaign, zeroing in on two other companies that had contributed much more.
Liz Ziegler, director of the state ethics commission, said a contribution to a PAC from an LLC is "not in and of itself a violation." She said she could not comment on the legality of any specific contributions.

WHERE'S MY ROY COHN?
Directed by Matt Tyrnauer. At Kendall Square. 97 minutes. PG-13 (thematic content, some sexual material and violent images).
As a filmmaker, Matt Tyrnauer gets around. His documentary subjects include a fashion designer (“Valentino: The Last Emperor," 2008), urban activist (“Citizen Jane: Battle for the City," 2016), high-end male hustler (“Scotty and the Secret Life of Hollywood," 2017) , and higher-end disco (“Studio 54," 2018). His latest, “Where's My Roy Cohn?," further shuffles the documentary deck — adding a joker who was definitely wild.
There's never been anyone quite like Roy Cohn (1927-86), and thank goodness for that. The work of literature he's associated with is Tony Kushner's“Angels in America," in which he figures as a particularly repellent character. “The Lord of the Rings" may be more pertinent. Cohn was a legal-eagle version of Gollum: endlessly compelling in his no-less endless awfulness. True, a ring of power didn't obsess Cohn. Why bother with jewelry when there was the thing itself: impure and unsimple. That obsession led to his connecting one of the more bizarre collections of dots in 20th-century US history: the Rosenbergs, Joe McCarthy, the Mafia, Ronald Reagan, Barbara Walters, the archdiocese of New York, and (inevitably) young Donald Trump.
Louche and lizardy, Cohn was one of those post-imperial only-in-New-York characters. Planted at the intersection of influence and celebrity, he'd be at Studio 54 one night and in court the next morning (either as litigant or defendant). Cohn was also gay, not so much closeted as hiding in plain, catch-me-if-you-can sight. His default mode was defiance: of convention, of law, of truth. He looked like Caligula (those hooded eyes!) and acted like a brat. Put another way, he was tabloid catnip. All of which makes Tyrnauer's documentary very lively.
The only child of an heiress and judge, Cohn was an outer-borough princeling, that borough being the Bronx. No one ever doubted his brains. At 20, he graduated from Columbia Law School. At 24, he was a prosecutor in the espionage trial of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg. This quickly led to his becoming McCarthy's chief aide, which in turn led to the Army-McCarthy hearings, which in turn — there were a lot of turns to Cohn's career — made him internationally famous, or infamous.
Returning to New York, Cohn entered private practice and reveled in his sordid reputation. It was good for business, after all, though his eventual disbarment wasn't. As one of the documentary's talking heads puts it, “He's the only person I've met who actually enjoyed being indicted."
Tyrnauer and his researchers have done a terrific job of gathering archival photographs and footage. A joint talk-show appearance by Cohn and Gore Vidal is part hallucination, part cage match. The roster of interviewees is extensive and varied. There are former associates (including an admiring Roger Stone), Brandeis historian Thomas Doherty, Cohn cousins (who have some of the most damning things to say), and such journalists as author Ken Auletta, Vanity Fair's Marie Brenner, and The New York Times's Sam Roberts.
Interspersed throughout the film are snippets from an interview Auletta did with Cohn toward the end of his life. It's fascinating to hear Cohn speak in an unbuttoned fashion. Yet whenever there's a clip Tyrnauer cuts to tape reels turning on a large recorder. It's emblematic of how heavy-handed, even overblown, the filmmaking can get. Intercut with a discussion of Cohn's homosexuality, for example, is footage from soft-core gay porn. The treatment generally of Cohn's sexuality falls somewhere between the salacious and prurient. That contributes to the general liveliness, but not in a good way. The same is true of the overbearing score.
The biggest problem with “Where's My Roy Cohn?" is the documentary's attitude toward its subject: not its being critical (an uncritical approach to Cohn would be about as interesting as a daytime visit to Studio 54), but that it so thoroughly accepts his view of himself. Cohn wasn't so much an ideologue or power broker (especially not that) as he was a brand specialist, and the brand he specialized in was Roy Cohn. He marketed an image of himself as ultimate insider and attack-dog attorney (accurate enough, except that canine ferocity works far better in kennels than courtrooms). The truth-in-advertising description of what Cohn sold was something quite different: smoke and mirrors. “He never gave up on his own myth," the late gossip columnist Liz Smith says in the documentary. No one promoted that myth as effectively as he did. Until now, maybe: “Where's My Roy Cohn?" repurposes his self-mythologizing for its own, only in reverse. The problem is that dark smoke and cracked mirrors are still smoke, still mirrors.

Texto completo: Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
To get into the minds and notebooks of Times journalists, look no further than Instagram.
The app allows many reporters, editors and photographers based in New York and around the world to show how their professional and personal lives intersect. Their feeds become a repository for unpublished details and visuals, and serve as a creative outlet for their journalism-related interests.
Here are 12 Instagram accounts from journalists who span The Times's report and take readers behind the scenes.
Kathy Ryan, @kathyryan
Director of photography for The New York Times Magazine
Follow for: Artistic scenes from the New York Times headquarters, in black, white and red
In 2012, a shaft of light falling across some stairs in the Times Building caught Kathy Ryan's eye. She posted a photo of it on Instagram, and from there evolved a series she dubbed "Office Romance."
"It's overwhelmingly about the light for me," says Kathy, who captures The Times through the people and objects in its Renzo Piano-designed building -- "the greatest studio in the world."
Her subjects, often bathed in soft sunlight punctuated by stripes of shadow, appear ethereal in her posts -- a conscious contrast to the chaos of working at a news organization. She shoots them mainly in black and white, with the occasional pop of cherry red, in a style that evokes film noir.
Each post, she says, captioned with the time and date she took the photo, allows her followers "for a split second to be in this remarkable building in this remarkable city."
But if the Times Building looks like the Garden of Eden on Kathy's feed, its sins can be seen on @dont_tell_renzo, a humorous account she recommends.
Pete Wells, @pete_wells
Restaurant critic
Follow for: A slice (often literally) of New York's dining scene
Pete Wells has a disclaimer in his Instagram bio: "sloppy with lighting; struggling with focus."
"I'm kind of picking the least bad photo from my three visits to a restaurant," Pete says of his approach to posting. "And sometimes it's still pretty bad."
While he makes no claims to high art, his feed brings followers to tables across New York City, from slice shops to high-end sushi counters. They can also see his review process, which often involves comparing meals at similar restaurants.
Pete credits Instagram for "one of the biggest subtle changes in restaurant design" in recent years: lighting fixtures that act as spotlights for your plate, chosen with amateur food photographers in mind. But when the lighting isn't ideal, he admits he uses his iPhone's flash, "even though it's the biggest no-no in food photography."
"If you do it right," he advises, "you can get really great high-contrast, shadow-filled dramatic pictures."
Sebastian Modak, @sebmodak
52 Places correspondent
Follow for: Armchair travels around the world at a breakneck pace
Unlike most Times journalists, Sebastian Modak actually has Instagram in his job description. As the 52 Places Traveler, he uses the platform daily to bring along his followers on his yearlong adventure.
Sebastian's feed brims with his best shots from each destination and gives a sneak peak of his weekly columns. But his Instagram Stories are, well, another story. The often humorous slide shows of photos, text and videos reveal the "not fun part of travel" -- flight cancellations, exhaustion, middle-of-the-night driving -- and everyday moments, like a haircut in Croatia, that don't make it into his articles.
Followers have sent Sebastian a plethora of recommendations, and he has taken them up on offers to be his tour guide. "It's a really nice way to meet people," he says, "and I never even thought of Instagram as a tool for that."
Pamela Paul, @pamelapaul2018
Editor of the Book Review
Follow for: Reflections on books and illustrators, occasionally interrupted by three beguiling cats
The focus of Pamela Paul's Instagram feed is, unsurprisingly, books -- "both in terms of my life here at The Times and, on a more personal level, my life as a reader and also an author."
But her "gold standard" for a post is when her family's cats -- Zoomer, Loki and Octavian -- intrude upon her more purely literary posts.
In a rather meta photo, she recently documented her progress on a forthcoming children's book -- about a cat that gets in the way of a boy's reading -- with Zoomer lounging on some early illustrations. "It is not purely fiction," says Pamela, who has two sons and a daughter.
Farther from home, Pamela likes to post photos of foreign-language books and bookshops she stumbles across: "It's a lot of what I'm doing when I'm abroad, and I think it's part of what people are looking to me for." Mindful of her own aversion to Instagram posts of idyllic vacations, she adds, "But it doesn't make anyone feel bad."
Eve Lyons, @lyonse
A Styles photo editor
Follow for: Photographers to have on your radar, with a dash of mustard yellow
For Eve Lyons, what started as a practical concern last year -- finding meeting spaces after a recent renovation of The Times's newsroom -- turned into "a happy accident."
When photographers came in for portfolio reviews, she started using the diner-style yellow booths installed during the office makeover. As an experiment, she began doing short shoots at the end of each meeting to feature the artists on her Instagram.
"The yellow is such a good visual signifier," says Eve, who likes the playfulness that the colorful booths elicit.
As the series evolved, she added more photos to highlight not only the photographers, but also pieces from their portfolios. It has turned into "a destination for people to explore new work, new stories, new projects," not to mention her own visual Rolodex of freelancers.
On a temporary assignment, Eve has decamped to Los Angeles, where actual diner booths are serving as her stand-in.
Dionne Searcey, @dionnesearcey
Politics reporter
Follow for: Snapshots of life in West Africa , and election coverage from across the United States
Dionne Searcey joined Instagram four years ago, after becoming The Times's West Africa bureau chief. She saw the platform as a way to document everyday life in a part of the world that remains off the radar for many.
"I always tried to show things that were unexpected," she says, and "to bust stereotypes of the continent in general being a place that was full of bad things."
Her Instagram posts, often short vignettes drawn from the stories she writes, have featured cow herders in Nigeria, athletes in Senegal and her own life as a correspondent.
Dionne, who is from Nebraska and recently joined the Politics team to cover the 2020 election, has already started posting photos from her new beat.
"I'm hoping to travel to parts of rural America that people on the coasts call 'flyover country,"' she says, comparing her work in the United States to her work abroad. "I think that is a similar approach and a similar philosophy, of showing parts of America that a lot of people in big cities don't see."
Hannah Wise, @sewmanycomments
A social media editor
Follow for: Crafting #inspo and amusing news commentary
After covering a police shooting for The Dallas Morning News in 2016, Hannah Wise wanted a tactile, screen-free activity to do in her free time. The solution came when she saw a "really bizarre" comment on one of her reporting partner's stories and decided to embroider it.
With that, her new hobby and new Instagram account were born. Hannah, who has a background in graphic design, compares it to drawing in thread. She stitches quotes and comments that amuse her, or that touch a nerve in journalism.
Most of her hoops end up as gifts. A 12-inch one memorializing the journalists who were killed at the Capital Gazette last year was included in The Dallas Morning News's care package for the Maryland newspaper.
Fittingly, she used embroidery to announce her new job at The Times last month.
Gia Kourlas, @giadk
Dance critic
Follow for: Mesmerizing short videos of dancers in the studio
For nearly three years, Gia Kourlas has written the weekly #SpeakingInDance column, which explores the world of dance through videos posted on Instagram.
The sessions are filmed by professional videographers and appear on The Times's main Instagram account, but Gia also takes her own videos and edits them for her personal feed. She hopes her followers feel "like you're in a room with me, seeing a different perspective."
Growing up in Ohio, Gia, who trained as a dancer, didn't get to see many performances. Now, with Instagram, she can bring dance to more people around the country, and the world.
"I just want to get more eyes on dance," she says, "in any way I can."
Mujib Mashal, @mujmash
Senior correspondent in Afghanistan
Follow for: Poignant scenes from a changing Afghanistan
Mujib Mashal's reporting has taken him across Afghanistan, where he was born and raised, and South Asia. He likes to take photos as part of his notes, documenting the remote, visually stunning areas where his work takes him.
"Those are places that sometimes I don't get back to," he explains, "so I want to make a record for my own memories and archives."
From that collection, he chooses photos for his Instagram feed to illustrate the news he covers, or simply to show life in Kabul, where he lives -- a stop at a park, a cafe, an ice cream shop.
Mujib uses Instagram Stories to present highlights from his bigger projects. He thinks of them as trailers to draw readers in through the videos, sounds, photos and quotes he gathers during his reporting.
Melissa Clark, @clarkbar
NYT Cooking reporter
Follow for: Cooking ideas and tutorials, and vicarious global eating
Melissa Clark wants her Instagram feed to feel inviting, and to inspire home cooks. That means mostly informal shots of the new dishes she tests in her Brooklyn kitchen -- no filters or food styling involved.
"I like to show people how I really do it," she says.
Melissa also sees the platform as an educational tool. She has created in-depth guides to techniques such as yogurt making with Instagram Stories. And when she travels, she uses her food photos to share what she learns, like how it's actually O.K. to eat oysters in the summer.
In addition to pictures of cooking and eating, you'll see Melissa's daughter, husband and friends. "Each post tells a story, but the whole entire group tells a story, too," she notes. And if you look closely, that story follows a pattern, which Melissa boils down to "cake, child, sardine or anchovy, cocktail."
Chang W. Lee, @nytchangster
Photographer
Follow for: Visual stories told in up to 10 photos
Photojournalists may take hundreds, even thousands, of shots for a single story, but only a fraction will end up online -- and even fewer in print.
For Chang W. Lee, Instagram is a way not only to publish more work from his Times assignments, but also to express himself through the photo selection and edits. In his posts, he often arranges multiple images to tell a complete visual story.
"It's like my own publication," he says.
Chang, who has traveled around the world for The Times, favors human interest stories. He has shot young basketball players in the Philippines, impoverished families in the United States, and the aftermath of natural disasters. He also has an eye for capturing the artistry and physical feats of athletes in motion at major events like the Olympics and the United States Open.
Nick Casey, @caseysalbum
Andes bureau chief
Follow for: Reporting outtakes from Latin America
Nick Casey's Instagram -- a play on his Twitter account, @caseysjournal -- acts as an extension of his notebook. Details that don't make it into his stories, behind-the-scenes reporting shots and glimpses of daily life in Latin America fill his feed.
"If you look at my Instagram account and the reporting," Nick says, "they kind of put together one piece."
You can see photos from Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, Easter Island and Colombia, where he lives. But perhaps his most photographed country is Venezuela, where he was based until 2016, when he was banned for his reporting on the country's economic collapse.
Now, whenever Nick returns to Venezuela, he posts as much as he can. He says his photos of trying to pay for things -- with stacks of bills and wire transactions, necessitated by the country's hyperinflation -- have particularly captured his followers' attention.

Washington Arena Will Host a Betting Parlor

Texto completo: The Capital One Arena, home to the N.B.A.'s Wizards and N.H.L.'s Capitals, will be the first major team sports facility in the United States to have a betting parlor.
The Capital One Arena in Washington will be the first major team pro sports facility in the United States to have a sports betting parlor, officials announced Thursday.
Betting kiosks in stadiums are common in many countries, but have yet to start appearing in the United States, which has long had stricter laws that have effectively barred sports gambling in most states.
But recent legal changes, including a United States Supreme Court ruling last year that allowed states to legalize sports betting, have opened up new markets. And as more states authorize gambling, taking bets in an arena where a game is going on has become part of the wider debate.
William Hill, which runs betting parlors all around Britain, will operate the Washington facility. "We rent to McDonald's and Dunkin' Donuts and now William Hill," said Ted Leonsis, the chief executive of Monumental Sports, which owns the arena and its two main tenants, the Wizards of the N.B.A. and the Capitals of the N.H.L.
It is not yet clear when Washington fans will be able to start pushing dollar bills through a betting window. "I don't really have a good feel for how long that might take," said Joe Asher, the chief executive of William Hill U.S. "You would bet on sometime in 2020. We'll let the regulatory process play out."
Thorny issues that process might raise include whether betting could continue during college games involving Georgetown, which also calls the arena home. The N.C.A.A. has been strongly against sports betting over the years, and has not softened its stance toward lawmakers to the same degree as the N.B.A. and the N.H.L.
It is possible that the authorities will require the parlor to be shut during games, although Asher opposed that, calling it a "poor fan experience." Even without the lounge, fans could continue to bet on a mobile app. Officials said they expected to use location tracking technology to ensure that fans could use only the William Hill app, not its competitors, when inside the arena.
Gambling divides the public, and there has often been opposition to expansion of it on many grounds. For many years, the major professional sports leagues were, like the N.C.A.A., virulently against sports gambling.
The parlor would be "great for the arena, great for the league," Leonsis said. He noted that he had visited William Hill parlors in Britain and "there's nothing untoward or unfriendly about it."
In more recent times, Adam Silver of the N.B.A. has been seen as a gambling friendly sports commissioner, dating to 2014 when he wrote an opinion column for The New York Times urging legalization. He noted at the time, "In England, for example, a sports bet can be placed on a smartphone, at a stadium kiosk or even using a television remote control."
The parlor at the Washington arena would be open every day, not just during games. It would also stay open after games for fans to bet on West Coast action.
"It's not like gambling isn't happening in an unregulated world," Leonsis said. "There's a lot of gambling today off the books, that's not creating jobs."
He also emphasized the statistical side of gambling and likened placing a bet to buying a stock. Of the word "gambling," he said: "I hate that term. We want this to be the beginning of a highly reasoned, highly rational experience." (For years, casinos have eschewed the term for describing betting in many forms, preferring the euphemism "gaming.")
Officials said bets offered at the parlor could include a wide range of sports, including overseas events like soccer and cricket. They also could include in-game betting, a fast kind of action that continues even after a game starts.
Leonsis said he also thought wagering would help women's sports "because the level of engagement increases."
A year ago, the New Jersey Devils announced that they would have the first in-arena gambling parlor. But Washington authorities noted that facility doesn't actually take bets, but rather offers William Hill officials to help fans download its app. Last year, Dover Downs in Delaware began accepting bets on a NASCAR race held at the adjoining track.

Woodward chided for questioning at book talk

Texto completo: Authors detailed the saga of Harvey Weinstein
It seemed like the perfect combination of three Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative journalists: the Washington Post's Bob Woodward interviewing the New York Times's Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey on Wednesday about their best-selling book, "She Said," a deep dive into their investigation of sexual assault and harassment allegations against Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein.
But about 20 minutes in, things got awkward. As Woodward repeatedly interrupted the authors to ask questions or clarify facts, audible murmurs rippled through the crowd. Eventually, one attendee yelled, "You're interrupting her!" as many applauded in agreement. The audience grew increasingly frustrated, particularly when Woodward told Twohey and Kantor that they were "dodging" his question about what might have motivated Weinstein's alleged abuse. "Stop!" several crowd members yelled at Woodward as he continued to press the topic. Some people heckled and hissed; others left early.
It was a rare sight for Sixth & I, a popular Washington event space that frequently hosts book talks with high-profile authors. The bizarre scene in front of a sold-out crowd quickly made the rounds on social media as audience members voiced their displeasure with Woodward's questions and interruptions. ("It's [an] exercise in how not to interview," journalist Kara Swisher tweeted to her 1.3 million followers.)
Woodward responded in an email late Wednesday night: "As a longtime believer in the First Amendment, I am glad people got to express themselves. Jodi and Megan signed a copy of their book for me after the session, which I enjoyed very much, and said 'thank you for the fabulous questions.' So there may be a difference of opinion." When reached by phone, he said that he had simply been trying to move the conversation along. Twohey and Kantor had asked him to moderate the book talk, he noted, adding, "I couldn't praise the book more."
On Thursday, Kantor and Twohey wrote in an email: "We're just starting our book tour, and we're grateful to all the moderators - Bob Woodward, Katie Couric, America Ferrera and many others - who have agreed to join us onstage. We welcome all questions, from them and especially from the audience, because each one is an opportunity to relate the wrenching decisions that many of our sources had to make and grapple with MeToo as an example and test of social change in our time." Representatives for Sixth & I declined to comment.
The conversation started out pleasantly as Woodward called the book "a masterpiece" and asked Kantor and Twohey about the origins of their reporting on Weinstein. Tension in the crowd started building during a discussion about Irwin Reiter, Weinstein's accountant, who ended up being an invaluable source. As Woodward broke in while Kantor was speaking, some people in the audience lost patience.
"Let her finish!" a woman yelled from the balcony, as others started clapping.
Woodward, Twohey and Kantor briefly paused, then quickly moved on. But the atmosphere became uncomfortable several minutes later when Woodward asked about the reasons for Weinstein's behavior.
"If you spent all the time on him, you have to ask the question, which you really don't address in the book, and that is: Why did he behave this way?" Woodward asked. "I know you're not psychiatrists or psychologists, but share with us the 'Why?' . . . because there's so many strange things he does."
"That's a good question - I think we could spend days or weeks or even months trying to get to the bottom of his psychology," Twohey said, adding that the question applies to the psychology of Weinstein's enablers as well. This led into a discussion of his brother, Bob Weinstein, who begged Harvey to get help.
"You're artfully dodging the question," Woodward said, and the audience started rumbling.
"I'll tell you what we know. It's that this story is an X-ray into power, and how power works," Kantor said, as the crowd erupted into loud applause.
"It's also about sex, isn't it?" Woodward asked.
"No!" several attendees yelled at the same time.
"It's not about sex in the romantic sense," Kantor said, adding that "part of the way it's about power is that it's about work." She noted that some of their sources were harassed as soon as their first day on the job.
Despite the increasingly loud muttering of a frustrated audience, Woodward continued his line of questioning, asking about Weinstein's possible reasons behind his "perverted sexual crime." "So, why? I'm sorry, I know this puts you on the spot. What is driving him?"
"Stop!" someone else yelled.
"Let's get to the Q&A!" hollered another attendee.
But Woodward kept going, and the audience kept calling for him to stop. At one point, Woodward asked "What's Rosebud for Harvey?" - a reference to the central mystery in the movie "Citizen Kane" - and wondered whether his behavior was "some kind of weird foreplay."
Twohey and Kantor didn't want to play armchair psychologists, saying that making any judgments about Weinstein's motivations would be beyond the limits of their knowledge.
"I understand you're dodging that question," Woodward said to more groans from the crowd, before moving on to the lawyers in Weinstein's orbit who helped protect him over the years.
The conversation continued without incident until turning to the topic of Christine Blasey Ford, who talked to Twohey and Kantor about her September 2018 testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Ford alleged that then-Supreme Court nominee Brett M. Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her in high school, while Kavanaugh denied the charge and was later confirmed as a justice.
"Do you believe her?" Woodward asked.
"What I can tell you is that Christine Blasey Ford is probably the most precise and diligent source subject that certainly I have ever reported on," Twohey said, adding that Ford refused to be coached by advisers for her testimony.
"She didn't have some precise memory on when this happened or exactly where and so forth, and that has been used to undermine what she testified to and said," Woodward said. "I think the interesting question now is: With all that's available about Christine Blasey Ford and that allegation, and Kavanaugh, if he were, say, a judge here in the District of Columbia, and somebody gave you that information, is it enough to publish a story?"
"All women deserve to be heard!" yelled a woman from the balcony, as the crowd started to grumble once again.
"Was it sufficient?" Woodward continued. "Would it have met your standard in the New York Times to publish that?"
"You know, I think the reason your question is so interesting is it was your paper, The Washington Post, that did publish what really was exactly that story," Kantor said.
Kantor and Twohey didn't seem fazed by the audience reaction or Woodward's questioning. Later, as they waited for attendees to line up for their turn at the microphone, Kantor got her chance to ask Woodward a question: What investigation would he assign into the Trump administration? After she found his reply somewhat insufficient, Kantor good-naturedly responded: "I don't think you're answering my question," to the audience's knowing laughs and applause.
But the crowd members weren't done voicing their displeasure with how the conversation had unfolded. A woman approached the microphone, thanking Twohey and Kantor for their hard work before turning her attention briefly to Woodward: "Mr. Woodward, you're one of the legends of the profession, but hearing you repeatedly interrupt these women all night . . ." she started, before being drowned out by the audience clapping. She noted it was "frustrating."
After the talk wrapped, the audience was still buzzing with frustration as they sat in the pews, complained to Sixth & I staff and stood in line to have their books signed. Roslyn Simpson, 49, said that as a moderator, Woodward "interrupted too often, which is what happens when women want to tell their stories." She pointed to a lack of self-awareness on his part. "It was very surprising, disruptive and rude," Simpson said.
Sarah Burgess, a 33-year-old consultant who was attending the book talk with her sister, was disappointed that Woodward steered the authors away from talking about their journalism and their sources - because he wanted to spend more time talking about Weinstein, the perpetrator. "I think that it's been really clear in the news in the past couple of years that society doesn't take women's voices seriously, so I think it's really important that we make sure that we're making space for women to speak and that we're listening," Burgess said.
In the last minute of the Q&A, an audience member asked the authors: Who do you hope will read your book?
"I hope men read it," Kantor said.

Texto completo: The first hug was stunning enough — a young man embracing his brother’s killer for nearly a minute in the middle of the courtroom, just after telling the woman: “I forgive you.”
“I love you as a person and I don’t wish anything bad on you,” 18-year-old Brandt Jean assured Amber Guyger, the former Dallas police officer convicted Tuesday for shooting Botham Jean as he ate ice cream in his own home. Guyger said she aimed to kill out of fear after entering the wrong apartment by mistake; jurors said it was murder.
Then came another unlikely embrace — from the judge in the case that sparked renewed protests Wednesday as Guyger received a 10-year-sentence that some called a “slap in the face.” With the emotional trial wrapped up, Judge Tammy Kemp walked over in her black robes to give Guyger a Bible. Then, she wrapped her arms around Guyger and murmured to her. Together, they prayed.
The two extraordinary moments would polarize, just like the case that led up to them, raising fresh questions about race in a white officer’s fatal shooting of a black man.
For some, the hugs and words of understanding were testament to the power of radical compassion, often rooted in religious convictions — “a spirit of forgiveness, faith and trust,” as the Dallas Police Department put it in a Wednesday evening tweet.
U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) praised Brandt Jean for a demonstration of “Christian love,” while District Attorney John Creuzot called the teen’s address to Guyger an “amazing act of healing.”
“I would hope that the greater community, not just Dallas, not just Texas, but the greater United States, could gain a message from that,” Creuzot said.
Nikki Haley, the former U.N. ambassador, called the teen’s hug an “amazing example of faith, love, and forgiveness.”
But others were confused, troubled and outraged. They saw the latest feel-good episode in a long history of black people extending quick absolution to white people in the face of horrific wrongs.
“Black people, when they experience injustice, there’s almost an expectation that we will immediately forgive and therefore can sort of move on,” Jemar Tisby, an African American historian and writer, told The Washington Post. “So I think a lot of people are reacting — that we have a right to be angry, a right to grieve, and a right to want justice.”
The conversation that played out on social media as clips of both Brandt Jean’s and Kemp’s moments with Guyger went viral continued a debate familiar to those who watched or read about a similarly startling scene of mercy four years ago, when loved one after loved one of the victims of white supremacist Dylann Roof — all black parishioners at a church in Charleston, S.C. — offered prayers and forgiveness just days after Roof’s deadly rampage.
On Wednesday, the congregation at the Dallas West Church of Christ, where the Jean family went to worship after the sentencing, met a video of Brandt Jean’s words to Guyger with applause and tears, the Associated Press reported.
The responses of victims’ relatives in both Dallas and Charleston were part of a long tradition in the black Christian community, Tisby said, one he thinks is rooted in everything African Americans have endured since slavery. It’s an attitude he sees in Fannie Lou Hamer, the black civil rights activist who once said, “Ain’t no such a thing as I can hate anybody and hope to see God’s face” — and an attitude he witnessed this past weekend at commemorations of a 1919 massacre of black Americans, where he said people spoke of justice but not revenge.
“There has been such a long history of injustice perpetrated against black people in the United States that if we didn’t forgive, we run the risk of being consumed by bitterness,” Tisby said.
Back in 2015, others found the attitudes of the Charleston shooting victims’ families hard to comprehend. In a New York Times article titled “Why I Can’t Forgive Dylann Roof,” writer Roxane Gay expressed wonder at the reactions and slammed a society she called overeager for the mourners’ compassion.
“White people embrace narratives about forgiveness so they can pretend the world is a fairer place than it actually is, and that racism is merely a vestige of a painful past instead of this indelible part of our present,” she wrote.
Similar misgivings were on display Wednesday as the Guyger case came to an end. The judge’s hug for Guyger — highly unusual, many commented — provoked particular controversy as some pointed to other convicts who received no such shows of kindness.
“Did Crystal Mason get a hug when she was sent to jail for voting?” one critic asked on Twitter, referencing a black mother in the same state of Texas who was infamously sentenced to five years in prison for casting a ballot illegally.
Tisby thought of epithets like “thug” thrown at black people and dehumanizing discussions of Michael Brown, the teen fatally shot by police in 2014. African Americans stereotyped as threatening or prone to crime are often denied the sort of empathy Guyger got during her sentencing, he said; others online echoed his sadness at uneven distribution of the kind of compassion Brandt Jean showed.
“I think black people are legitimately upset when we extend grace in the face of clear and blatant injustices, but we’re never extended that same grace in the public mind,” Tisby said.
Guyger has said her actions toward Botham Jean had nothing to do with race, testifying tearfully to her remorse and saying the shooting was “about being scared” rather than “about hate.” But a lawyer for the Jean family framed Guyger’s conviction as a “victory for black people in America” and an affirmation that their lives matter.
Guyger has also come under fire for offensive texts made public before her sentencing: Messages show the former officer joking about the death of Martin Luther King Jr., disparaging black colleagues and responding to a friend’s warning that a dog “may be racist” with the words, “It’s okay. I’m the same.”
Those texts were on the minds of some people dismayed at Judge Kemp’s gestures to Guyger.
“How Botham Jean’s brother chooses to grieve is his business. He’s entitled to that. But this judge choosing to hug this woman is unacceptable,” tweeted Atlantic writer Jemele Hill, telling people to remember that “this convicted murderer is the same one who laughed about Martin Luther King Jr’s assassination.”
Legal experts had questions for Kemp, too. Kenneth Williams, a professor at the South Texas College of Law in Houston, said he’d never seen anything like Wednesday’s interaction with Guyger in his 30 years of legal practice. It was not only rare but inappropriate, he said, since Kemp might have to weigh in on further case developments if Guyger appeals.
“She has indicated an affinity or sympathy for the defendant,” he said, suggesting the case might have to go to another judge.
Kemp did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday. The Post was unable to reach Brandt Jean, and an inquiry to the Jean family’s lawyer was not immediately returned.
Andra Gillespie saw grace in the Jean family’s response to 26-year-old Botham Jean’s killer: It was “their way of trying to fulfill their Christian obligation to forgive her in spite of everything that happened,” she said. But the political science professor at Emory University and devout evangelical also cautioned — as she did after the Charleston church shooting — against letting forgiveness dull the urgency of injustice. Admiration for Brandt Jean’s speech shouldn’t distract people from deeper, troubling questions raised by Botham Jean’s death, she said — questions like, “Why do people kill black people before they ask questions they might ask of other people?”
“My problem is when outsiders look at that situation and they get touched by the forgiveness and then they get lulled into thinking we don’t have to do anything else for that situation. … We don’t take the lessons from it that we should,” Gillespie said.

Texto completo: El fiscal general de EEUU William Barr le pide al CEO de Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg, que postergue sus planes de cifrar los tres servicios de mensajería de la compañía hasta que los funcionarios del Dpto. de Justicia puedan determinar que esto no reducirá la seguridad pública, en una carta fechada el 4 de octubre, reporta CNBC.
La solicitud de Barr está respaldada por funcionarios del Reino Unido y Australia.
BuzzFeed News informó por primera vez la historia después de obtener un borrador de la carta abierta el jueves 3 de octubre.
La carta (que puede leerse en inglés aquí), que el Departamento de Justicia envió a CNBC el jueves, se basa en las preocupaciones sobre los planes de Facebook para integrar y cifrar sus servicios de mensajería en Messenger, Instagram y WhatsApp.
Una investigación del New York Times publicada el sábado encontró que la tecnología encriptada ayuda a los depredadores a compartir pornografía infantil en línea de una manera que hace que sea mucho más difícil rastrear la aplicación de la ley.
“Las mejoras de seguridad en el mundo virtual no deberían hacernos más vulnerables en el mundo físico”, dice la carta. “Las empresas no deben diseñar deliberadamente sus sistemas para impedir cualquier forma de acceso al contenido, incluso para prevenir o investigar los delitos más graves”.
En la carta, Barr y el secretario del Interior del Reino Unido, Priti Patel, el secretario de Seguridad Nacional de los Estados Unidos, Kevin McAleenan , y el ministro de Asuntos Interiores de Australia, Peter Dutton , le piden a Facebook que cree una forma para que las fuerzas del orden accedan a contenido ilegal.
“Los riesgos para la seguridad pública de las propuestas de Facebook se exacerban en el contexto de una plataforma única que combinaría servicios de mensajería inaccesibles con perfiles abiertos, proporcionando rutas únicas para que los posibles delincuentes identifiquen y preparen a nuestros hijos”, dice la carta.
En un comunicado, un portavoz de Facebook dijo a CNBC: “Creemos que las personas tienen derecho a tener una conversación privada en línea, en cualquier lugar del mundo”. Facebook dijo que ha estado consultando con expertos en seguridad infantil, así como con gobiernos y otras compañías tecnológicas. para garantizar que sus servicios recién encriptados sean seguros. Facebook “se opone firmemente a los intentos del gobierno de construir puertas traseras porque socavarían la privacidad y la seguridad de las personas en todas partes”, según el comunicado.
Facebook no es la primera compañía tecnológica que se enfrenta al gobierno por el cifrado. Hace solo unos años, Apple estaba en un enfrentamiento con la Oficina Federal de Investigación (FBI) sobre el acceso al iPhone de un tirador en el ataque de San Bernardino de 2015.
Un juez federal le pidió a Apple que ayudara al FBI a desbloquear el teléfono, pero el CEO de Apple, Tim Cook, calificó la orden como “peligrosa” porque podría permitir al gobierno sobrepasarse en casos futuros y exigir a las empresas de tecnología que vigilen a los usuarios. El Departamento de Justicia finalmente dijo que podía acceder a los datos del teléfono sin Apple y le pidió al juez que abandonara el caso.

Texto completo: The School of the Art Institute of Chicago (SAIC), a global leader in art and design education, is putting forward a series of compelling arts and culture events for Chicagoans this fall. The programming, which ranges from panel discussions to curated exhibits, is meant to inspire area residents and the next generation of thinkers and makers who challenge convention.
Current and upcoming activities include: * More Speech: A Conversation About the First Amendment (October 1): At the third annual Citizen Artist Forum, SAIC, in partnership with the American Library Association and Illinois Library Association, will host a panel discussion examining how the First Amendment impacts our freedom of speech and expression. More Speech will feature the diverse perspectives of artists, journalists, historians, librarians, legal professionals, and civic leaders. Former WGN anchor Robert Jordan will moderate the panel.
* The Struggle for Justice (October 8): SAIC will join the Pulitzer Center and Illinois Humanities for an evening focused on the struggle for justice, from the first arrival of enslaved people sold to colonists in 1619 to the mass incarceration of black and brown people. The evening will begin with a keynote address by award-winning New York Times journalist Nikole Hannah-Jones.
* Re:Working Labor (September 21 – November 27): The result of a year-long research initiative, this exhibit at the Sullivan Galleries brings together over 80 artists to examine representations of labor in an increasingly technologized society.
* The Chicago Architecture Biennial (September 19, 2019 – January 5, 2020): SAIC will have a strong presence at the biennial, with contributors spanning Tania Bruguera (MFA 2001, HON 2016), Santiago X (MFA 2018), Theaster Gates (HON 2014), Assistant Professor Maria Gaspar (Contemporary Practices), and full-time visiting artist Paola Aguirre (Architecture, Interior Architecture, and Designed Objects), who is the founder of borderless studio.
"The School of the Art Institute of Chicago’s more than 150-year history includes a deep commitment to civic engagement, because we know art and design are not separate from the culture we live in, the politics we negotiate, and the civilization we build together," said Elissa Tenny, president of SAIC. "The topics interrogated through the talks and exhibitions at SAIC and the contributions of our community to the Chicago Architectural Biennial are essential to how artists pursue the questions that expand our understanding, increase our compassion and help make our shared society better across our state, nation, and world."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – After canceling several campaign events following a heart procedure, Sen. Bernie Sanders will participate in the upcoming Democratic primary debate, his campaign confirmed to USA TODAY Thursday.
Sanders, 78, had two stents inserted earlier this week after doctors found blockage in one artery. His campaign said Wednesday that he experienced chest discomfort during a campaign event Tuesday evening in Las Vegas.
The debate will be held on Oct. 15 at Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio. CNN and The New York Times will be hosting the debate, which will air live at 8 p. m. ET.
Sanders' wife, Jane, in a statement Thursday said the Vermont Senator's doctors "are pleased with his progress, and there has been no need for any additional procedures. "

"Bernie is up and about," she said in the statement. "Yesterday, he spent much of the day talking with staff about policies, cracking jokes with the nurses and doctors, and speaking with his family on the phone. "
The senator will likely be discharged before the end of the weekend and will be heading back to Burlington where he will take a few days to rest, the statement said. Jane Sanders said her husband is "ready to get back out there and is looking forward to the October debate. ”
Sanders, who ran for president in 2016, has been consistently among the top three Democratic contenders. He currently stands in third place in national polling, according to a Real Clear Politics' averaging of major polls.

Shreveporter's YA novel releases with an international splash

Texto completo: Shreveporter Ashley Elston's novel, "10 Blind Dates," just released this week—but it already has made a worldwide impression and been optioned for film.
The Young Adult novel, Elston's fifth, has an original, engaging plot: Teen Sophie breaks up with her boyfriend at the beginning of Christmas vacation and is stuck at her grandparents' house with her boisterous family while her overprotective parents are away.
The clever twist: Her grandmother devises a plan to help her get over her broken heart—10 blind dates set up by various family members.
As Elston says, "I mean, what could go wrong?"
How she came up with the idea:
"I have a huge family, and we spend most holidays together. I love the chaos of a house bursting to the seams with family. Also, I have a special place in my heart for blind dates since I met my husband on a blind date on Valentine's Day in 1992. I thought it would be fun to write a story that combines the two."
While the book is set at Christmas, she doesn't see it as a holiday novel. "Christmas is part of the setting but it's really more about family."
"10 Blind Dates" is quite different from Elston's earlier works. Biggest shift? "This is my first book without a dead body."
Her other novels include "The Rules for Disappearing," a finalist in the Best Young Adult Novel category of the International Thriller Writers Thriller Awards, and "This Is Our Story."
"I started writing this book on the side while I was waiting for edits on my earlier novels that were all mysteries and thrillers," she says. "It was fun to step away from those books and write something that was lighter. I really didn't think my publisher would be interested in it because it was so different."
Not only did the publisher, Disney Hyperion, go for it, it has been sold for publication in 23 foreign countries, from Hungary to Russia to Brazil to Israel. "This has been the most amazing part of the journey," Elston says. "It is overwhelming to think about."
And the book has been optioned for film to the same production company that adapted Jenny Han's "To All the Boys I've Loved Before."
While "10 Blind Dates" is considered a YA novel by Elston, many such novels cross over to adult readership, and she thinks this story might appeal to adult readers too. (I'd add it's also a great Christmas or birthday gift for that hard-to-buy-for teen girl in your family.) It retails for $17.99 and is available from most booksellers, including Barnes and Noble and Amazon.
More about the author
Elston has a liberal arts degree from LSU in Shreveport and worked for many years as a wedding photographer before turning her hand to writing. She and her met-on-a-blind-date husband have been together 27 years, married for 22 and have three sons. For more information, visit www.ashleyelston.com. To contact her, email ashleyelstonbooks@gmail.com.
A follow-up book ahead:
"My next book will be a companion to '10 Blind Dates,' told from two of Sophie's cousins' points of view. We don't have a title yet, and I think it will be out in Spring of 2021."
A lesson learned on her writing journey:
"To keep an open mind and to be open to trying something new."
A book recommendation from Elston:
"I loved Megan Miranda's latest book, 'The Last House Guest.'" (Miranda writes psychological thrillers for adults and young adults, and "The Last House Guest" is a New York Times bestseller and a recent pick for Reese Witherspoon's book club. For more about this author: www.MeganMiranda.com.)
Book columnist Judy Christie is the author of 18 books, including the upcoming nonfiction work: "Before and After: The Incredible Real-Life Stories of Orphans Who Survived the Tennessee Children's Home Society," co-authored with Lisa Wingate, and releasing October 22 from Penguin Random House.

Texto completo: Sanders, 78, was traveling for a gun forum in Las Vegas that other candidates were also scheduled to attend. He was to travel to California later this week. He is currently recovering in a Las Vegas hospital, the campaign said.
"During a campaign event yesterday evening, Senator Sanders experienced some chest discomfort," Jeff Weaver, a longtime adviser to Sanders, said in a statement. "Following medical evaluation and testing, he was found to have a blockage in one artery and two stents were successfully inserted. Senator Sanders is conversing and in good spirits. He will be resting up over the next few days. We are canceling his events and appearances until further notice, and we will continue to provide appropriate updates."
Why it matters
Sanders, a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination, has kept up a busy schedule on the campaign trail, typically holding multiple events in several cities a day. Over the weekend, he held several events at colleges in New Hampshire. Following his trips this week to Nevada and California, he had been expected to travel to Iowa this weekend, according to a campaign aide.
The Sanders campaign had planned to go on air with his first television ads of the campaign this week in Iowa, announcing a two-week $1.3 million buy Tuesday. An ad tracking service, Medium Buying, said Wednesday Sanders began canceling those ads. The reason for the cancellation was not immediately known.
How he's feeling
One campaign aide, referring to Sanders, told The New York Times on Wednesday morning: "He feels better than ever because that's how people feel after they get a stent and there's more blood flow."

False Claims of a 'Coup,' Shared by Trump

Texto completo: President Trump and his supporters now have at least one unifying, if inaccurate, message against the impeachment inquiry. It is, they say, an unconstitutional coup.
Mr. Trump posted that conspiratorial message on Twitter on Tuesday night, saying, "As I learn more and more each day, I am coming to the conclusion that what is taking place is not an impeachment, it is a COUP, intended to take away the Power of the People." Early Wednesday, the president tweeted out a ready-for-TV video made by his re-election campaign, repeating the "coup" claim against a backdrop of grainy shots of House Democrats and Joseph R. Biden Jr.
On Wednesday afternoon, the Trump campaign announced that it would be rotating the ad into an existing $ 8 million campaign, for broadcast on national cable outlets and on digital platforms.
His use of the phrase follows repeated assertions on conservative media, including by high-profile right-wing personalities and outlets such as Tucker Carlson, Breitbart, Rush Limbaugh and "Fox & Friends." Beginning with Sean Hannity at 9:30 p.m. on Tuesday, talk of a "coup" was discussed nearly every hour on Fox News, by hosts and surrogates. Often, the president's tweet was shown onscreen and read verbatim.
The definition of a coup d'état is the sudden illegal overthrowing of a government by a small group. An impeachment is a legal, constitutional process by which Congress accuses high officers of the federal government of misconduct.
"To call an impeachment process an attempted coup is dangerous because it aligns with those who believe in 'deep state' conspiracies," said Joan Donovan, director of the Technology and Social Change Research Project at Harvard. "Across different platforms, these deep state conspiracy theories are functioning as disinformation that bring the country into further turmoil about the legitimacy of the presidency."
This episode underscores the way that disinformation now proliferates via fast-moving partisan cable news and energetic social media communities. Mr. Trump's tweets are part of his familiar playbook: He escalates accusations born in right-wing media, portraying himself as the victim of an unsubstantiated scheme. His followers often jump in and amplify the messages online, which are then picked right back up on conservative shows and news outlets.
Often, the accusations deflect attention from further inquiries. Much of the discussion on cable news on Wednesday morning was about his "coup" tweet and less about developments in the impeachment inquiry.
"This isn't just about the internet and the effect of toxic social media communities," said Jennifer Grygiel, a professor at Syracuse University who studies social media. "It's a sign that the president is ramping up his propaganda efforts, and that it has entered a new phase."
After a clear conspiratorial narrative about the attempted "coup" was established and promoted by mainstream conservative outlets, the work of online amplification began. One of its driving voices, Tom Fitton, the president of Judicial Watch, the conservative group that recently sued the Justice Department for records on Mr. Biden and Ukraine, has participated heavily in hyperpartisan social media communities to further amplify the claim.
For instance, on r/The_Donald, a quarantined community of the online bulletin board Reddit, supporters of the president often trade in disinformation and coordinate the spread of pro-administration conspiracy theories across different platforms. There, Mr. Fitton has posted 79 times since the beginning of September, rallying members by encouraging them to tune into Mr. Hannity's show to learn about the coup conspiracy, and generally pushing the theory as a hot-button issue.
Mr. Fitton said in an interview that President Trump had faced constant lawless and constitutional harassment by Congress. He added that the quarantine of r/The_Donald -- which warns readers about the forum's content -- was "convenient" and that Twitter was a "more impactful" medium these days.
The coup conspiracy stretches "across platforms as the president's followers are on social media such as Reddit, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube," Professor Grygiel said. "But it is important to remember that he is the one in power. He uses feedback from these platforms and communities to his advantage."
Indeed, Mr. Trump's claims of a coup date back as early as the beginning of this year, even arguing that the investigation led by Robert S. Mueller III into Russia's election interference was an "attempted coup." Mr. Trump has referred to coups seven times on Twitter during his presidency, all in 2019, and many times the claims were cut from segments on right-wing cable news.
The claims grew in the last week. Talk of a "coup" became common among guests on Fox News, including on programs as varied as daytime talk shows like "Outnumbered" and "The Five," and more widely watched prime-time shows like "The Ingraham Angle."
"It's no accident," said Doug Heye, a former spokesman for the Republican National Committee. "I've been hearing this word being used for well over a year now and in part because it's really seeped through on conservative media."
An hour after Mr. Trump tweeted the "coup" conspiracy on Tuesday, Senator Kamala Harris, the California Democrat running for president, weighed in. She sent a tweet to Jack Dorsey, the chief executive of Twitter, saying it was "time to do something" about Mr. Trump's being allowed to use the platform to essentially spread and magnify the flawed claim.
Ms. Harris also wrote an open letter on her campaign letterhead to Mr. Dorsey, calling on Mr. Trump to be barred for tweets that could incite violence.
Twitter said it had received Ms. Harris's letter and that the company intended to respond. In June, Twitter announced that it would soon start placing notices on top of certain "newsworthy" tweets -- say, from a world leader like Mr. Trump -- that the tweets violated the company's rules about abusive behavior but that Twitter also determined it was in the public's interest for the content to remain online.
But so far, Twitter said, it has not yet applied the new policy.

Snakes are slithering out of the moat

Texto completo: Forget that drain-the-swamp nonsense. Now President Trump wants to fill the moat.
Over at the failing New York Times, Michael D. Shear and Julie Hirschfeld Davis composed one of the most delightfully revealing paragraphs of the Trump era:
"Privately, the president had often talked about fortifying a border wall with a water-filled trench, stocked with snakes or alligators, prompting aides to seek a cost estimate. He wanted the wall electrified, with spikes on top that could pierce human flesh. After publicly suggesting that soldiers shoot migrants if they threw rocks, the president backed off when his staff told him that was illegal. But later in a meeting, aides recalled, he suggested that they shoot migrants in the legs to slow them down. That's not allowed either, they told him."
I picture Trump explaining to baffled aides how migrants, bleeding from gunshot wounds to their legs, could still crawl across the border, as if they weren't impoverished humans but the first wave of the Zombie Apocalypse. I picture, too, the unlucky procurement officer, tasked with producing the moat's "cost estimate," calling reptile farms for bulk pricing on alligators and water moccasins:
"Do your alligators eat migrants?"
"Errr. I'm not sure I-"
"Never mind. We'll take 1 million."
Trump denied the report (much like he denied inquiring about nuking hurricanes), perhaps because it made him sound like Dr. Evil proposing to mount lasers on sharks. But the alligators-and-snakes report had a ring of truth.
This is because Trump specializes in similarly clumsy strategies, most recently in battling the impeachment inquiry. Moats, alligators, snakes, flesh-piercing spikes and below-the-belt shots: It's an apt metaphor for the administration's defense as it tries to block the probe with all the subtlety and nuance of medieval siege warfare. All that's missing is the flaming pitch and diseased-animal carcasses to be launched at the Capitol from the White House South Lawn.
Watch as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo builds the moat, Attorney General William Barr plays the alligator, Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani acts the snake, Trump launches flesh-piercing spikes from his trebuchet - and the four of them fire shots indiscriminately at whistleblowers, civil servants and investigators.
The belligerent Pompeo, digging a trench between Trump and his inquisitors, ordered State Department officials not to provide testimony or documents to the congressional inquiry. Pompeo misled the public by implying that he knew nothing about the call between Trump and the Ukrainian president, finally admitting on Wednesday that he was on the call. At the same time, Pompeo has presided over a revival of the probe of Hillary Clinton's emails, as The Post reported, this time ensnaring more people by retroactively relabeling old emails as classified.
Playing the alligator, Barr offers a (crocodilian) smile by day. But by night he submerges himself in the muck, stalking foreign officials - the Italians, the British, the Australians, the Ukrainians - for dirt that would hurt Trump's political opponents. At the heart of Barr's probe is a conspiracy theory that Trump's former homeland security adviser, Tom Bossert, says he long ago warned Trump had been "completely debunked."
Reprising his role of snake in Trump's impeachment defense is Giuliani, who in Trump's name has given endless media interviews making the false allegation that Joe Biden bribed Ukrainian officials to get his son out of legal jeopardy. Now, The Post reports, House investigators are examining whether Giuliani has been using his work for Trump to advance his clients' interest.
Trump produces the flesh-piercing barbs himself - in great quantity. He shared a warning that impeachment would "cause a Civil War." On Wednesday, he told his 65 million Twitter followers that the investigation is "BULLSHIT" and "nothing short of a coup." In the Oval Office with the Finnish president, Sauli Niinisto, Trump sounded off about the "corrupt" Biden, "crazy" Nancy Pelosi and "Shifty Schiff," a "lowlife" who "couldn't carry his blank-strap" - apparently referring to a jockstrap. Officials, Trump said, "should look at him for treason," a capital offense.
Responded Niinisto: "Finland is the happiest country in the world."
Finally, there's the shoot-out-their-legs technique. Trump and his team have already mowed down the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, a well-regarded civil servant, who was recalled (and disparaged to Ukraine's president) after Giuliani publicly criticized her; she apparently raised concerns about Giuliani's shadow agenda in Ukraine. Kurt Volker, the former U.S. representative for Ukraine negotiations, was reportedly forced by Pompeo to resign, serving as scapegoat for Giuliani's mischief. Trump now hopes to inflict worse injuries on the whistleblower, a "spy" who has committed "treason" worthy of execution. He claims that he is "entitled" to "learn everything about" the whistleblower - dubbed by the White House a "saboteur" of democracy.
Shots fired. The snakes are slithering out of the moat. See you later, alligator.

Texto completo: Rome • Secretary of State Mike Pompeo confirmed on Wednesday that he had listened in on President Donald Trump’s telephone conversation with the president of Ukraine — a call that has become the subject of a whistleblower’s complaint and is at the heart of an impeachment inquiry by House Democrats.
“I was on the phone call,” Pompeo said at a news conference in Rome — the first time he has addressed the topic publicly since reports surfaced that he had heard the exchange.
He did not elaborate on the conversation and did not answer a question about whether anything in it had raised a red flag for him.
In the July 25 call, Trump pressed President Volodymyr Zelenskiy of Ukraine to investigate the activities in Ukraine of former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter.
Zelenskiy thanked Trump for U.S. assistance in defending Ukraine against Russia, and said his country wanted to buy more American weapons. Trump, who days earlier had frozen an aid package for Ukraine, replied, “I would like you to do us a favor though,” and asked for help in investigating the 2016 election.
An anonymous whistleblower within the government filed a complaint in August, citing the call and other factors as information that “the President of the United States is using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election.”
The complaint, made public last week, says that White House officials, rather than storing a record of the conversation with Zelenskiy in the usual computer system, attempted to “lock down” information on it, placing it in a more secure system, accessible to fewer people, because they “understood the gravity of what had transpired in the call.”
Pompeo’s confirmation that he was on the call came as he engages in a fight with Democrats in the House of Representatives who have demanded swift access to State Department officials for interviews as part of the impeachment inquiry.
And it came on a day when Congress may receive new information about the Trump administration’s interactions with Ukraine, from the State Department inspector general, Steve A. Linick, who requested to meet committee staff members on Wednesday.
Pompeo on Wednesday described U.S. policy toward Ukraine as “remarkably consistent,” being focused on addressing “the threat that Russia poses” and attempts at “helping the Ukrainians to get graft out, and corruption outside of their government.”
“Even,” he added, “while all this noise is going on.”
Current and former State Department officials have said it is unusual for a secretary of state to listen in on presidential calls with other world leaders. That is normally a role filled by the White House national security adviser and the National Security Council staff.
Pompeo supports a get-tough policy on Russia and may have been included on the call to ensure that message was reflected in Trump’s comments to the Ukrainian president.
John Bolton, another Russia hawk who then was serving as national security adviser, often disagreed with Pompeo, and they competed for Trump’s ear. Since Bolton was ousted last month, Pompeo’s influence has grown.
In his request to Zelenskiy, Trump pushed a conspiracy theory that his own staff had repeatedly told him was false — that Ukraine, not Russia, had intervened in the 2016 election and that it had done so on behalf of the Democrats.
In another call, to Prime Minister Scott Morrison of Australia, Trump asked for help discrediting the Mueller investigation into Russia’s election interference.
Trump has repeatedly vented his anger at the impeachment inquiry on Twitter, asking why he was not “entitled to interview” and know the identity of the whistleblower, whose anonymity is protected by law to prevent retaliation. He has also tweeted that he is the target of an attempted coup and that Rep. Adam B. Schiff, D-Calif., the chairman of the Intelligence Committee, should be arrested.
On Tuesday, Pompeo released a letter that excoriated House Democrats for demanding quick depositions of State Department officials involved in policy toward Ukraine, calling it an “act of intimidation” that did not allow his officials sufficient time to respond.
“What we objected to was the demands that were put that deeply violate fundamental principles of separation of powers,” Pompeo said on Wednesday. “They contacted State Department employees directly, told them not to contact legal counsel at the State Department — at least that’s been reported to us — told them State Department wouldn’t be allowed to be present.”
He said that the department would cooperate with Congress, but that, “we won’t tolerate folks on Capitol Hill bullying and intimidating State Department employees — that’s unacceptable.”
The House postponed the first of the depositions, which it had scheduled for Wednesday.
Rep. Elijah E. Cummings, the chairman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, accused Pompeo of obstruction.
“In response, Congress may infer from this obstruction that any withheld documents and testimony would reveal information that corroborates the whistle-blower complaint,” Cummings said in a statement.
In response to Pompeo’s letter, he wrote that House Democrats believed Pompeo had an “obvious conflict of interest” because of his presence on Trump’s call with Zelenskiy and that they would not inform Pompeo about other witnesses.
“The committee may infer that he is trying to cover up illicit activity and misconduct, including by the president,” the statement read.

Texto completo: El representante demócrata Adam Schiff, jefe del Comité de Inteligencia de la Cámara Baja y ahora responsable del impeachment a Donald Trump, supo de la llamada del presidente a su homólogo ucraniano días antes de que el escándalo se hiciera público.
La persona que dio a conocer el asunto que ha echado a andar la maquinaria del juicio político al mandatario estadounidense se puso primero en contacto con un asistente de Schiff , que le pasó la información al demócrata.
Según The New York Times, un portavoz y funcionarios y exfuncionarios estadounidenses aseguraron que el denunciante habló con este miembro del equipo de Schiff para trasladarle cómo se habían manejado sus acusaciones cuando un compañero se las hizo llegar al principal abogado de la CIA. El asesor de Schiff le sugirió al denunciante que rellenara una queja formal , de acuerdo al diario neoyorquino.
En un comunicado, Patrick Boland, portavoz del Comité de Inteligencia y del propio Schiff, dijo que el denunciante contactó con ellos para obtener información sobre cómo informar posibles irregularidades dentro de su jurisdicción . “El comité aconsejó convenientemente al denunciante que contactara con un Inspector General y que buscara asesoría legal”, explicó Boland. Según aseguró, el comité no recibió ni revisó la queda de antemano.
El portavoz del equipo de Schiff, que dejó las puertas abiertas para todos las personas que quieran recibir asesoría sobre actos de dudosa moralidad, “espera completa protección para (el informante), a pesar de las amenazas del presidente “. “Solo gracias a su coraje -continuaba el comunicado- estos actos de abuso de poder del presidente salieron a la luz”.

Texto completo: El presidente Donald Trump rechazó de que quería armar su muro fronterizo con México con características como picos, una corriente eléctrica y un foso son cocodrilos, además de sugerir disparar a los inmigrantes en los pies para evitar que cruzaran a los Estados Unidos.
“Ahora la prensa está tratando de vender el hecho de que quería un foso relleno de caimanes y serpientes, con una cerca electrificada y puntas afiladas en la parte superior, en nuestra frontera sur” , escribió Trump. “Puedo ser duro con la seguridad fronteriza, pero no tan duro. La prensa se ha vuelto loca. ¡Noticias falsas!”
Now the press is trying to sell the fact that I wanted a Moat stuffed with alligators and snakes, with an electrified fence and sharp spikes on top, at our Southern Border. I may be tough on Border Security, but not that tough. The press has gone Crazy. Fake News!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 2, 2019
Así reaccionó el mandatario sobre un extracto de un libro de los reporteros de The New York Times, Michael Shear y Julie Hirschfeld Davis , declarando detalles en los informes que incluye disparar en los pies a los inmigrantes .
Los reporteros informaron que Trump “a menudo” sugirió rodear su muro fronterizo con una trinchera como un foso e incluso les pidió a los ayudantes que buscaran estimaciones de costos para el plan presentado supuestamente men marzo en el Despacho Oval.
Entre sus otras ideas estaba su amenaza, que emitió públicamente, de cerrar la frontera entre México y Estados Unidos por completo, sus sugerencias privadas de que los agentes de la Patrulla Fronteriza comenzaran a disparar a los inmigrantes y su idea de que los listones de acero electrificado que componen el muro fronterizo.
“¡Me estás haciendo parecer un idiota!” , habría expresado molesto el mandatario en la tensa reunión de marzo con la entonces secretario de Seguridad Nacional Kirstjen Nielsen y el secretario de Estado Mike Pompeo .

As Bernie Sanders recovers, health scare may become 2020 issue

Texto completo: Senator Bernie Sanders said Wednesday he is “feeling good" after undergoing an emergency medical procedure this week to have two stents inserted in an artery.
But the political fallout from his health incident may reverberate long after the Vermonter returns to the campaign trail.
The scare, several political analysts asserted, highlights Sanders's age and, in a crowded field just four months before the Feb 3. Iowa caucus, could give voters pause about the 78-year-old liberal and potentially boost Senator Elizabeth Warren.
“While Sanders might be totally fine, any kind of serious health scare involving a candidate this late in the campaign is going to elevate questions about his age," said Alan Abramowitz, a political science professor at Emory University in Atlanta. “A lot of Democrats want a candidate who can beat Trump and wage a months-long campaign. With Sanders, there are now questions about his health, with [former vice president Joe] Biden there are questions about his off-script moments where you wonder, 'What he is thinking?' "
“This whole episode works to Warren's advantage," Abramowitz said.
All of Sanders's scheduled campaign events have been canceled until further notice. And a first round of television ads has also been axed, at least in Iowa, his campaign said Wednesday
Still, provided Sanders makes a full recovery, Democratic consultant Erik Smith expects Sanders's supporters to stick with the Vermont senator.
“Where this health scare may have an impact is among voters still making up their minds. Sanders needs to grow his level of support and something like this could give people pause," said Smith, who has worked on a number of Democratic presidential campaigns but is neutral in the 2020 contest.
Poll after poll shows Warren is, by far, the preferred “second choice" among likely Democratic primary voters who back someone else. This means that should voters sour on their current favorite, they might consider Warren next. For example, a recent Morning Consult/Politico national poll found that nearly a third of Sanders supporters could migrate to Warren.
In a statement Wednesday morning, the campaign said that during an event in Las Vegas Tuesday night, Sanders began to feel some chest discomfort. After a full medical evaluation, it was determined there was a blockage in one of his arteries, and two stents were successfully inserted. This is the second time Sanders needed medical treatment this year. In March, he needed seven stitches after he cut his head on a hotel shower door, which was not a result of a fall.
As Sanders rests in the Las Vegas area, his heart incident serves as a reminder that the three top Democratic contenders are among the oldest candidates to ever run for president. Sanders is 78, Biden is 76, and Warren is 70. All are trying to defeat Donald Trump, 73, who was the oldest person to assume the presidency.
Still, Sanders is far from formally suspending his campaign or dropping out. Stent insertions are a relatively common medical procedure that don't sideline most people, allowing them to return to work and life.
That's why Steve Rosenthal, a veteran national Democratic strategist and labor leader, is skeptical that Sanders's time off the trail will have any lasting effect.
“It is a rigorous thing to run for the White House, and it takes a lot out of people," Rosenthal said. “Voters will have to decide whether these candidates are up to the task, but so far this sounds like this is a pretty minor procedure for Sanders."
Sanders tweeted late Wednesday afternoon that he is “feeling good. I'm fortunate to have good health care and great doctors and nurses helping me to recover."
Always on message, Sanders added that “None of us know when a medical emergency might affect us. And no one should fear going bankrupt if it occurs. Medicare for All!"
Sanders isn't the first national candidate to have heart issues in the midst of a campaign. President Dwight Eisenhower won reelection after a serious heart attack. George H.W. Bush was diagnosed with an irregular heartbeat while in office. Dick Cheney suffered his fourth heart attack just before becoming vice president.
The closest analogy for what Sanders is going through now was in 1999, when former New Jersey senator Bill Bradley, running for the Democratic nomination for president, was hospitalized during his presidential campaign for treatment of an irregular heartbeat, just weeks before the Iowa caucuses.
However, Sanders's health concerns coincide with overall questions about his campaign's political health. National and early state polls show Warren either tied or taking the lead from Biden, while Sanders's poll numbers have dropped.
That said, just hours before Sanders went into the hospital, the campaign was in a good mood. It announced the senator had raised $25.3 million in the third quarter of the year, which could lead the entire field by the time all candidates announce their own amounts in the next few weeks.
While Sanders is sidelined, Biden's family is mired — fairly or unfairly — in a scandal at the center of the House of Representatives' impeachment inquiry, which involves Trump wanting dirt about Biden's son's involvement with a Ukrainian energy company.
Which leaves Warren, who wished Sanders a speedy recovery, as the only top-tier candidate running at full throttle.

Texto completo: Les Winkeler is sports editor of the Southern Illinoisan, and will be retiring next April after 30 years on the job. He and his wife, Judy, live in Harrisburg.
1 What were your thoughts when SIU Athletic Director Jerry Kill decided to leave SIU again to become assistant coach at Virginia Tech?
Disbelief and a little disappointment. I thought Jerry had really come back to SIU to stay. He didn’t explicitly say this is where he would end his career, but I think people believed he would be here for the long haul. Jerry did a lot of good in his short tenure as SIU’s AD, but I, like of lot of other people, feel there is still work to be done. Having said that, I know how much coaching means to him. A person has to follow his/her dreams.
2 What is your favorite sport to write about?
Baseball/softball is my favorite sport to write about. Because I spent so much time playing the game, I feel I have a better grasp on the nuances and quirks of the game. On the other hand, there is nothing I like better than watching Saluki basketball. The speed of the game, the athleticism of the players is breathtaking.
3 You will retire in a few months from The Southern, where you were a reporter, sports editor and outdoors editor. What is your take on the future of print journalism?
I think it will always exist. Small-town papers are vital to the health of their communities. Newspapers cover school boards, city councils and county boards. Someone needs to serve as watchdog of the taxpayer’s dollar and newspapers are uniquely positioned to do that — either in print or augmented by online coverage. And, in these trying political times, The New York Times and Washington Post are thriving because of their investigative work. Again, newspapers are better able to devote time, resources and space to in-depth investigative journalism.
4 You have also been a member of the Southern Illinoisan editorial board. What do you think about the impeachment investigation into President Donald Trump?
No person is above the law. Members of Congress, of both parties, have taken an oath to defend and protect the Constitution of the United States. When evidence grows that a president has abused his power or broken the law, it is the constitutional duty of the House of Representatives to investigate. In this political climate, at least at this moment, it is unlikely the Senate would convict the president. However, I believe it is important for the House to proceed if for no other reason than to make it clear to future presidents the limits of executive power.
5 What would you consider to be your single greatest accomplishment in the newspaper business?
Surviving. And, that’s only half-facetious. Over the years, I’ve covered presidents, governors, big time athletes, goose callers, high school athletes and the everyday hobbies of the guy/gal who lives next door. The best accomplishment? Having people say this story or that story made me smile. Thanks. That makes it all worthwhile.

Texto completo: — Our editors review and recommend products to help you buy the stuff you need. If you make a purchase by clicking one of our links, we may earn a small share of the revenue. However, our picks and opinions are independent from USA TODAY’s newsroom and any business incentives.
Growing up, my mom never brought me apple picking. This wasn’t a punishment for anything, but she never saw the point. “Why would we pay to do work?” she asked. “And besides, what would we do with all the apples?”
If you’re more fun than my mom and went apple picking this season, you’re probably asking yourself the same question. Apple picking can be a cozy activity to ring in autumn weather, but it results in you having pounds and pounds of fruit withering away on your kitchen counter for weeks.
Whether you’re determined to actually use all the apples you plucked from their branches or just want to dive into fall, here’s some of our favorite apple dishes and snacks to cook—and the products you need to prepare them.
1. Bake them into a classic American pie
If you read this headline and said “apple pie, duh,” you were correct. Apple pie is American as, well, itself, and it’s the first thing most people think of when it comes to celebrating the season’s bounty.
While there’s one million ways to make a nice pie, we love this simple, traditional recipe from Sam Sifton at the New York Times. Dusted with rough sugar and served warm with vanilla ice cream, there’s no way to go wrong.
Need something to bake it in? Our favorite pie dishes are deep enough to hold plenty of filling and made with edges to support that perfect, flaky crust you’re looking for.
Get the Emile Henry Pie Dish on Amazon for $39. 99
2. Make an elegant French galette
While baking a rustic galette is a great use of fresh fruit all year round (I made both rhubarb-strawberry and peach-blueberry iterations this summer), an apple galette can be an elegant and light alternative to the typical American pie. This apple galette recipe from Lena Abraham on Delish can guide you through preparing this show-stopping dessert.
While galettes are free-form and don’t require a special pan, you’ll want to make sure you have one of the best baking sheets on hand to support your creation.
Get the Nordic Ware Baker’s Half Sheet on Amazon for $27. 24
3. Crisp them into chips
With a food dehydrator or specialty air fryer, it’s easy enough to turn all your apples into chips or chewy dried snacks. Healthy snacking like this is great for those who want a break from the rich desserts of the season. We wrote a guide with everything you need to know about using a food dehydrator.
If you truly don't have the space for another single-purpose gadget like a dehydrator and you're also interested in air frying and pressure cooking, we recommend the Ninja Foodi Deluxe, which placed among our best multicookers.
Get the Excalibur Food Dehydrator on Amazon for $287
4. Brew your own hot cider
Hot apple cider is definitely my favorite drink of the fall—sorry, pumpkin spice. It’s also not challenging to make at home. All you need is a ton of apples, the right spices, and a properly insulated vessel to boil everything in, like one of our favorite Dutch ovens. We love this simple recipe—it will make your whole home smell like fall.
Get the Staub Cast Iron Round Cocotte on Amazon for $324. 95
5. Slice them for a snack
Revolutionary, I know—you can eat apples raw. If you want to eat more of your apples but hate crunching on them whole, this quick apple slicer will help. Not only does it core the apple, but it also cuts it into 16 perfect wedges—all in one swift chop. A great gadget for anyone who has apple picking on their minds.
Get the Prepworks Apple Corer and Slicer on Amazon for $7. 52
6. Blend them into apple sauce
Apple sauce is probably one of the most obvious and space-efficient uses of all those apples you’ve picked. All you need is a solid hand blender to help turn your apples into a smooth (or chunky) sauce. This straightforward apple sauce recipe from Serious Eats is a great option.
Get the Breville Control Grip Immersion Blender on Amazon for $86. 52
7. Bake them into a bread
Sick of pie? A breakfast-friendly loaf of apple bread (which is more truly a loaf cake than bread) is a great alternative to super-sweet desserts. You’ll need a good loaf pan for this, but luckily, our favorite loaf pans won’t break the bank.
Get the Rachael Ray Yum-o! Nonstick Oven Lovin' Loaf Pan on Amazon for $7. 99
8. Preserve them for the future
If you’ve made everything on this list and you still have apples to spare, it’s time to start canning.
Whether you’re new to canning or it’s been a part of your family for a long time, you’ll find that canning and preserving apples is an easy process that guarantees you’ll have plenty of fruit for your future pies, breads, sauces and more. That means more delicious things when January’s gloom creeps in.
One thing you’ll definitely need to make canning happen? A good set of glass mason jars, which are useful all year round.
Get Ball 32-Ounce Mason Jars (Set of 12) on Amazon for $18. 99

Donald Trump tweet: I didn't want a moat, snakes, gators at border

Resumen: A new book says Donald Trump once suggested radical and even violent ways to stop illegal crossings – including the snake-and-alligator-filled moat.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – As a new book details his efforts to stop illegal immigration, President Donald Trump claimed Wednesday he did not propose lining the Mexican border with a moat filled with snakes and alligators.
"Now the press is trying to sell the fact that I wanted a Moot stuffed with alligators and snakes, with an electrified fence and sharp spikes on top, at our Southern Border," Trump tweeted, misspelling the word "moat. "
"I may be tough on Border Security, but not that tough," the president added. "The press has gone Crazy. Fake News!"
Trump later sent out the same tweet with the correct spelling of "Moat," though he needlessly capitalized it.
Now the press is trying to sell the fact that I wanted a Moat stuffed with alligators and snakes, with an electrified fence and sharp spikes on top, at our Southern Border. I may be tough on Border Security, but not that tough. The press has gone Crazy. Fake News!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 2, 2019
The book says that, in addition to closing the entire southern border, Trump at one point suggested radical and even violent ways to stop illegal crossings – including the snake-and-alligator-filled moat as well as shooting migrants in the legs.
"Privately, the president had often talked about fortifying a border wall with a water-filled trench, stocked with snakes or alligators, prompting aides to seek a cost estimate," according to the book "Border Wars: Inside Trump’s Assault on Immigration. "
Trump "wanted the wall electrified, with spikes on top that could pierce human flesh," it adds.
None of these ideas came to fruition, according to the book set to be published Tuesday.
Speaking with reporters after his Wednesday tweet, Trump again denied proposing to build a moat or an electrified, spiked fence to keep out migrants. "Never said it, never thought about it," he said.
As for the term "moat," Trump said: "It's not a word I use. "
(Trump also said the authors of the book are from The Washington Post, but that is incorrect; they work for The New York Times. )
The authors, Times reporters Michael D. Shear and Julie Hirschfeld Davis, also write that Trump backed off his public proposal that border guards shoot rock-throwing migrants because staff members told them that would be illegal.
"But later in a meeting, aides recalled, he suggested that they shoot migrants in the legs to slow them down," the book said. "That’s not allowed either, they told him. "
Trump threw out these ideas as he considered a plan to shut down the nation's southern border, a proposal also opposed by aides as well as congressional lawmakers who said it would wreak havoc with the economy. The president also abandoned that idea, grudgingly.
Trump did, however, make changes at the department of homeland security, including the removal of Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen.

Dershowitz says his accuser has done 'a terrible disservice' to #MeToo movement

Texto completo: Denying allegations of sexual assault, the prominent attorney Alan Dershowitz lashed out at one of his accusers, claiming that she fabricated her claims and was tarnishing the #MeToo movement.
"I've never met Virginia Giuffre. I've never had sex with her. And the reason I'm saying it is because it's true," NBC News quoted Dershowitz as saying while addressing reporters outside a New York courthouse following a hearing in a defamation lawsuit brought against him by Giuffre.
"She, on the other hand, has never and will never stand in front of any media and repeat her lie that she did have sex with me," he continued, accusing her of doing "a terrible disservice to a great movement, the #MeToo movement."
The #MeToo movement began on social networks in late 2017 following exposes by The New York Times and The New Yorker on movie mogul Harvey Weinstein's alleged exploitation of women.
"The 'Me Too' movement relies on credible reports of sexual misconduct," Dershowitz said, "and when a woman and her lawyer make false allegations and falsely accuse people, it hurts not only the falsely accused person, me, but it hurts everybody who is a true victim of sexual abuse," he said.
In her suit, Giuffre accuses Dershowitz of sexual assault and claims that he defamed her by claiming that she maliciously spread false allegations against him.
Giuffre and Sarah Ransome, two accusers of the late financier Jeffrey Epstein, have said that Dershowitz, who represented the convicted pedophile, also abused them.
Epstein was accused of sexual abuse and committed suicide in jail in August while awaiting trial. In 2007, on previous sex abuse charges, Epstein reached a plea deal with prosecutors that was widely criticized as overly lenient.
Dershowitz has denied being involved in sex crimes. He wrote in the Jewish Telegraphic Agency that he will continue to defend clients like Epstein.

Five things to know about former coach Schiano

Texto completo: Rutgers University athletics director Pat Hobbs says for the next two months he'll oversee the search for a replacement for fired football head coach Chris Ash. Nunzio Campanile is the interim head coach for now.
Speculation is rampant that former Rutgers coach Greg Schiano will be a frontrunner. Schiano went 68-67 in his 12 seasons here (before the school joined the Big Ten), including a stretch from 2005-11 where the Scarlet Knights were 56-33 with six bowl appearances.
In 2006, Rutgers was 11-2 with a win over No. 3 Louisville, a week spent inside the AP Top 10, and a school-record No. 12 finish in the AP poll.
So will Schiano return? Here's what you need to know:
Schiano is not a frontrunner... yet
When asked on Monday, Hobbs did not directly reference Schiano but also did not rule out the possibility that the former coach is in the mix.
"Anybody who can help Rutgers football be competitive and win conference championships is a candidate for this position," Hobbs said.
Despite speculation that Schiano could be a favorite for the job, Hobbs said he has not spoken to or met with any potential candidates yet.
"No, and I'll repeat that because I know there's been reports out there of agreements and other things," Hobbs said. "I have had no conversations with anyone about the permanent position of being the head football coach at Rutgers University."
The Tennessee controversy
The University of Tennessee planned to hire Schiano as its new head coach in 2017, but school officials changed their minds after many Vols' fans, donors and politicians balked at the hire. Their complaints stemmed from Schiano's background as an assistant at Penn State during Jerry Sandusky's tenure as the Nittany Lions' defensive coordinator. Sandusky is serving 30 to 60 years in prison for his conviction on 45 counts of sexual abuse. Schiano has said he had no knowledge of Sandusky's crimes. Tennessee school officials said they fully vetted Schiano, including examining his time at Penn State.
The Schiano file
Schiano left Rutgers for a job with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 2012 for his first-ever head coaching job at the professional level. He compiled a 11-21 record in two seasons before being fired in 2013.
He then coached two years at Berkeley Prep in Tampa before Urban Meyer hired him to be Ohio State's defensive coordinator and associate head coach in 2016.
Right now, he's not coaching
After three years with the Buckeyes, it was announced in early 2019 that Schiano would not be returning to the team. Reports suggested that the New England Patriots were hiring Schiano to be defensive coordinator, but he suddenly resigned due to his wishes to spend more time with his "faith and family."
Would a Schiano return mean The Chop is coming back?
The Rutgers football team's rallying cry was "Keep Chopping" during the Schiano tenure (Ash did away with the mantra. replacing it with "The Hunt"). Schiano started the craze after the 2005 opening game, when Rutgers blew a 20-point lead at Illinois and he had no idea what to say, according to the New York Times. Schiano gathered his players in a meeting room and recalled the words of a sports psychologist he once met at the University of Miami who told the team that playing football was like chopping wood. It caught on: It was not uncommon for a player to refer to a game as a "60-minute chop" and explain a big hit by saying, "I got my chop on."

Texto completo: It was never part of Michael Pollan's life plan to write a book about psychedelics — nor to use them — but he ended up doing both with profound results, the author told a standing-room-only crowd in a vast tent in the Seaport District Tuesday evening.
Pollan has been best known as the author of several books about food and agriculture, and is famous for the seven-word dietary dictum “Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants."
But when the author read about research showing that psychedelics freed terminal cancer patients from the fear of death, he was deeply intrigued, drawn into the research that would result in the 2018 book “How to Change Your Mind: What the New Science of Psychedelics Teaches Us About Consciousness, Dying, Addiction, Depression, and Transcendence."
Answering questions from Bina Venkataraman, who will become The Boston Globe's editorial page editor next month, Pollan described his extraordinary journey on the first day of HubWeek, a three-day festival of musical performances, digital art experiences, speakers, and other activities.
Psychedelics like LSD and “magic mushrooms" were once taken seriously by psychiatrists, Pollan explained. Only after Timothy Leary was thrown out of Harvard amid sloppy science and LSD-taking by his students did psychedelic drugs come to be seen as features of the 1960s counterculture.
Now, researchers at New York University, Johns Hopkins University, and elsewhere are taking another look, and finding intriguing possibilities. Most are studying psilocybin, the active ingredient in “magic mushrooms." Patients with terminal cancer who took psilocybin experienced significant declines in depression and anxiety that lasted even six months after a single psilocybin “trip."
“It's not a pharmaceutical effect," Pollan said. “The experience, more than the drug, is changing your mind. You're acquiring a new perspective. Your sense of self has changed."
Psychedelics are “essentially nontoxic," he said, affecting the brain but not the rest of the body. There is no lethal dose, and no risk of addiction.
But there are risks: “When the drugs are used in an uncontrolled way, a reckless way, people can walk into traffic or fall off buildings. It has happened," said Pollan, who teaches writing at Harvard and at the University of California Berkeley.
During his psychedelic trips, Pollan had a guide to prepare him for the experience, help him through it, and make sense of it afterward. He took several types of psychedelic drugs, including smoking the venom of a poisonous frog.
But the most meaningful experience was when he was on psilocybin.
“I saw myself dissolve," he said. “Something I recognized as me burst into a little cloud of Post-It notes, which is kind of appropriate for a writer." Then he saw himself as paint spread on the floor.
“I had awareness without ego, without self . . . You no longer have boundaries around you. You melt into something larger."
Some people feel they melt into the cosmos or become one with God. In Pollan's case, he became one with a Bach cello suite playing in his headphones.
He understood why the drug comforted dying patients, showing they were not isolated in a mortal body.
How does this happen? Researchers using functional MRIs have found that psilocybin quiets activity in the “default mode network," a group of brain structures that generates the sense of self. The network is like a switchboard operator connecting different parts of the brain in set ways.
Venkataraman asked Pollan whether psychedelics could play a role in political and social awareness today, as they did in the '60s.
“When you think about it that way, it's exactly the drugs for our times," he said. “We have a very egotistical politics. We objectify the other."
Pollan added that he that knew members of the audience “are thinking 'Trump, Trump, why haven't we given the drug to Trump?' I don't think it would work," he said, to laughter. “Things could go wrong and this man has his finger on the button.
“You need to want it, you need to be willing to dissolve your ego," he added. “He would not want to do that."
Venkataraman, who elicited Pollan's comments as they both sat in white armchairs on the stage, teaches in the program on Science, Technology, and Society at MIT and is a fellow at New America. A former journalist for The New York Times and the Globe, she also served as senior adviser for climate change innovation in the Obama White House and directs the Global Policy Initiatives at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard.
Her recent book, “The Optimist's Telescope: Thinking Ahead in a Reckless Age," explores how people can make decisions that will benefit individuals and society over time.

Texto completo: "Treason" is a word the president has increasingly used when talking about his critics.
WASHINGTON -- President Trump's language has changed in the days since House Democrats began their impeachment inquiry.
The presidential Twitter feed still has its share of complaints about the Federal Reserve, punch-back nicknames and favorable polls from friends such as Breitbart. But now Mr. Trump also talks about the civil war that could break out if impeachment proceedings against him continue, a whistle-blower he regards as a spy and, increasingly, treason.
His main targets have been the whistle-blower and Representative Adam B. Schiff, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. And he has used the word more than a dozen times on Twitter, beginning last September when he castigated The New York Times for publishing an Op-Ed article written by an anonymous administration official that questioned the president's ability to govern.
The last time an American was convicted of treason was in the 1940s, in part because the Constitution defines it narrowly as levying war against the United States or giving aid or comfort to an enemy during wartime. But as the impeachment inquiry unfolds, Mr. Trump has used the term to accuse people of disloyalty and signal to his supporters that his political opponents are un-American.
The accusation is nothing new in the right-wing vocabulary -- Ann Coulter, the president's sometimes adviser, sometimes adversary -- wrote a book on the topic. Mark S. Zaid, a Washington lawyer who represents the whistle-blower, reviewed the book in 2003, saying it contained revelations that would "shock anyone to the left of Attila the Hun."
But experts see a civic danger in the president frequently and falsely calling out what he labels treasonous behavior. Carlton F.W. Larson, a professor at the University of California at Davis School of Law and an expert on treason, said the president had cheapened the word through overuse.
"It is a complete debasement of political discourse where ordinary political disagreements are elevated to a level of capital crime," Mr. Larson said. "If Trump ever did uncover an instance of true treason, no one would believe him because he has so debased the meaning of that word."
Mr. Trump first mentioned treason in connection with the whistle-blower last week in a talk at the United States Mission to the United Nations, contending that what the whistle-blower was doing was spying and lamenting that there used to be a punishment for that, presumably meaning execution.
"I want to know who's the person who gave the whistle-blower the information, because that's close to a spy," Mr. Trump said. "You know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart? Right? With spies and treason, right? We used to handle it a little differently than we do now."
But what seems to have most provoked the president was Mr. Schiff's opening statement at a House Intelligence Committee hearing last week when he gave his own interpretation of Mr. Trump's July phone call with the Ukrainian president as a mobster issuing a veiled threat -- and the president did not like it.
"Rep. Adam Schiff illegally made up a FAKE & terrible statement, pretended it to be mine as the most important part of my call to the Ukrainian President, and read it aloud to Congress and the American people," Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter on Monday. "It bore NO relationship to what I said on the call. Arrest for Treason?"
This was just one outcome Mr. Trump said he wanted. A day earlier, the president said Mr. Schiff should be "questioned at the highest level for Fraud & Treason." On Tuesday, he added that the congressman should be charged with making a false statement.
"Oftentimes he uses a bazooka to swat a fly," Christopher Ruddy, a friend of Mr. Trump's and the chief executive of Newsmax Media, said in an interview, adding that he would like to see the president behave more "above the fray."
But Mr. Ruddy said he understood why the president had done it. "I think he sees the allegations against him as hyperbolic, so he responds back hyperbolically," Mr. Ruddy said.
Erin Perrine, a spokeswoman for the president's re-election campaign, put it another way. "For two years Democrats and the media falsely accused President Trump of being a Russian agent," she said. "It makes it difficult to take Democrats' feelings being hurt seriously."
Still, over the past year, Mr. Trump has accused the Democrats of treason for opposing his immigration policies, and The Times again for reporting on cyberattacks in Russia. In May, he accused unnamed individuals of spying on his presidential campaign -- an accusation he has levied at the Obama administration. Mr. Trump has used the phrase so often that it was a line of questioning at a news conference at the White House that month, when a journalist reminded Mr. Trump that treason was punishable by death.
Mr. Trump nodded, then listed several people he believed had engaged in treasonous behavior, including James B. Comey, the former director of the F.B.I.; Andrew G. McCabe, the former acting F.B.I. director; and Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, both former F.B.I. officials.
Mr. Trump also said that "probably people higher than that" had participated in an effort to undermine his election, alluding to claims he has made that Obama administration officials, and perhaps President Barack Obama himself, had participated in an effort to spy on his campaign.
All of the people Mr. Trump named are people he feels should have had a loyalty to the office of the presidency, and whose comments about him he has taken personally.
"I think a number of people," Mr. Trump said. "And I think what you look is that they have unsuccessfully tried to take down the wrong person," Mr. Trump added, referring to himself.
"He seems to confuse lack of loyalty to himself with treason," said Sheri Berman, a professor of political science at Barnard College, "thereby at the very least conflating the office of the presidency with the country as a whole."
In the past, Mr. Trump has defined treason as a crime with "long jail sentences" and, during the special counsel investigation into his campaign's ties to Russia, he brought up the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, who were executed in 1953 after being found guilty of conspiracy to commit espionage.
"When they say 'treason,' you know what treason is?" Mr. Trump asked reporters in 2017 as he defended his son, Donald Trump Jr., against criticism that he had met with a lawyer connected with the Russian government at Trump Tower to gather dirt on Hillary Clinton. "That's Julius and Ethel Rosenberg for giving the atomic bomb, O.K.?"
The Rosenbergs, who in fact were not convicted of treason, were prosecuted by Roy Cohn, a mentor of Mr. Trump's. Mr. Cohn, who as a young aide to Senator Joseph McCarthy made his name by ensuring that the couple was sent to the electric chair, would later go on to coach Mr. Trump in the art of full-on assault of his enemies.
"He's been vicious to others in his protection of me," Mr. Trump said in 1980 of his mentor, who was eventually disbarred for "unethical," "unprofessional" and "particularly reprehensible" conduct.
As Mr. Trump continues to emulate the bare-knuckle tactics he learned decades ago, he has alarmed Democrats who say his rantings against the whistle-blower will have a chilling effect in preventing people from coming forward in the future.
"This president's comments about 'spies and treason' and 'what we used to do in the old days' are totally unacceptable and will do serious damage far beyond this news cycle," Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, said on Twitter on Monday. "The whole reason we have whistle-blower protections is so intelligence professionals can report wrongdoing without fear of retaliation."
Representative Maxine Waters, a California Democrat who has long been targeted by the president at his rallies -- taunts she has said have led to death threats -- said on Tuesday that Republicans had not done enough to curb Mr. Trump's behavior.
"I'm calling on the GOP to stop Trump's filthy talk of whistleblowers being spies & using mob language implying they should be killed," Ms. Waters said on Twitter. "Impeachment is not good enough for Trump."

Texto completo: The former chief, accused of a hate crime after allegedly slamming a black teenager's head into a doorjamb, has used "derogatory racial terms," his lawyer said.
[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox .]
A former police chief in New Jersey who is on trial on a federal hate-crime charge after he allegedly slammed a black teenager's head into a doorjamb, once called President Trump "the last hope for white people," according to a recording recently played for jurors.
In the 2016 recording, which federal officials shared with The New York Times, Frank Nucera Jr., the former chief, can be heard saying that Mr. Trump was the last hope because "Hillary will give it to all the minorities to get a vote. That's the truth! I'm telling you."
The Trump comment was surreptitiously recorded by a Police Department colleague just months before the 2016 presidential election.
The recording was played in court last week by prosecutors in an effort to show that the alleged attack in September 2016 by the former chief on a guest -- an 18-year-old black man -- at a Ramada Hotel in Bordentown, N.J., was motivated by Mr. Nucera's "intense racial animus."
In 2015, Mr. Nucera had told a colleague that African-Americans were "like ISIS, they have no value," according to a criminal complaint filed in Federal District Court in New Jersey. "They should line them all up and mow 'em down," he said, according to the complaint.
Mr. Nucera's lawyer, Rocco Cipparone, said in an interview that his client did not commit a hate crime, although he acknowledged that Mr. Nucera made the Trump remark and has used "inappropriate language, including derogatory racial terms" in the past.
"These are embarrassing, ugly words, but if Frank Nucera did not strike this man, then the words are equally irrelevant," Mr. Cipparone said. "It is not a crime, even for a police officer, to use that language. It's not socially acceptable, it's not appropriate, but it's not criminal."
The United States attorney's office for the District of New Jersey declined to comment on the case.
As a result of the episode, Mr. Nucera, 62, resigned in 2017 from the Police Department in Bordentown, a township about 60 miles southwest of New York City. Aside from the hate crime charge, Mr. Nucera is charged with depriving a suspect's rights and making false statements to the F.B.I., according to the criminal complaint.
If convicted, Mr. Nucera faces up to 20 years in prison.
On Tuesday, prosecutors rested their case, and Mr. Nucera told the judge that he would not take the stand. A verdict in the three-week trial could come this week.
According to court papers, a manager at the hotel had called the police to report that two guests -- the 18-year-old man and a 16-year-old girl, who is also black -- who did not pay for their room the night before were swimming in the hotel pool. When the police arrived, according to court papers, the girl, who was not identified because she is a minor, and the man, identified at trial as Timothy Stroye, resisted arrest.
Mr. Stroye was eventually handcuffed, the complaint said, and an officer began walking him to a police car. Mr. Nucera then approached them from behind and pushed Mr. Stroye's head into a metal doorjamb that separated the hallway from the stairwell at the hotel.
Hours later, Mr. Nucera, using a racial slur, suggested to a colleague, who was recording the conversation, that Mr. Stroye and the girl were from Trenton, according to the complaint. Bordentown, which is about a 15-minute drive south of Trenton, has about 12,000 residents, most of whom are white, census data shows. The nearly 84,000 residents in Trenton are mostly black.
Mr. Stroye could not be reached for comment.
Michael Theokas, a spokesman for Bordentown Township, would not say whether Mr. Nucera had been disciplined by the Police Department as a result of his actions on that night.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — The Trump administration and the leaders of the House impeachment inquiry clashed Tuesday over Democrats' demands to depose State Department officials who are witnesses in their growing investigation, trading accusations of underhanded tactics.
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo pushed back in a letter Tuesday morning on a demand from three House committees for US diplomats to sit this week for depositions on Capitol Hill, saying the effort amounted to “an act of intimidation" and did not allow enough time for the State Department to properly respond.
The chairmen of the House Intelligence, Foreign Affairs, and Oversight and Reform Committees, who have scheduled the confidential interviews, scoffed at the suggestion, accusing Pompeo of being the one who was “intimidating department witnesses in order to protect himself and the president."
Blocking them from showing up as scheduled, they added, would constitute obstruction of Congress's work — an action Democrats view as an impeachable offense itself.
“Any effort to intimidate witnesses or prevent them from talking with Congress — including State Department employees — is illegal and will constitute evidence of obstruction of the impeachment inquiry," wrote Representative Adam B. Schiff, the chairman of the Intelligence Committee; Representative Eliot L. Engel, the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee; and Representative Elijah E. Cummings, the chairman of the Oversight and Reform Committee. “In response, Congress may infer from this obstruction that any withheld documents and testimony would reveal information that corroborates the whistle-blower complaint."
Meanwhile, the State Department's inspector general is expected to brief staff from House and Senate committees Wednesday on documents Congress has requested from the State Department about Ukraine.
In his letter, Pompeo did not refuse outright to allow the State Department employees to answer House investigators' questions about the actions of President Trump and his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani. Those issues are at the heart of a whistle-blower's complaint, which details attempts by the president to pressure Ukraine's leaders to help smear one of his top Democratic challengers, former vice president Joe Biden, using Giuliani to spearhead the effort.
But the testy exchange cast doubt on whether Democrats would be able to begin the depositions as planned on Wednesday, and raised the possibility that they might instead have to first issue a subpoena demanding compliance or turn to other pressure points.
Others in the president's camp appeared to be preparing to confront the fast-moving inquiry, too.
Giuliani, who is named in the whistle-blower complaint as a point man in the president's efforts to pressure Ukraine's government, retained his own lawyer for the escalating inquiry. Jon Sale, an assistant special prosecutor in Watergate, confirmed on Tuesday that he has been brought on by Giuliani, who received a congressional subpoena on Monday.
The House chairmen who jointly scheduled the depositions were said to be preparing additional requests and subpoenas for information related to the case.
They have already issued a subpoena to Pompeo for documents related to the matter.
At the White House, an indignant Trump kept his focus on the anonymous whistle-blower. In a series of tweets, the president asked why he was not “entitled to interview" the person. The online venting came a day after Trump said the White House was trying to find out the person's identity, despite institutional directives and confidentiality protections.
In addition to interviewing the “so-called 'Whistleblower,' " Trump said Tuesday, he would also like to interview “the person who gave all of the false information to him."
The president's remarks appeared to prompt a forceful, if not explicit, warning Tuesday from a senior member of his own party. Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa, the senior Senate Republican and a longtime champion of whistle-blower laws, said the government and the media “should always work to respect whistle-blowers' requests for confidentiality." He did not explicitly mention Trump.
“No one should be making judgments or pronouncements without hearing from the whistle-blower first and carefully following up on the facts," Grassley said in a written statement from Iowa, where he underwent surgery this week.
Grassley also pushed back against a claim frequently repeated by Trump and his allies that the whistle-blower was a “fraud" because he was not a firsthand observer of the events he described in his complaint.
“Complaints based on secondhand information should not be rejected out of hand," Grassley said, “but they do require additional leg work to get at the facts and evaluate the claim's credibility."
Trump's latest attack on Schiff questioned why the congressman was not “being brought up on charges for fraudulently making up a statement and reading it to Congress." The president was referring to remarks Schiff made during a hearing last week, where he dramatized the July phone call in which Trump pressed President Volodymyr Zelenskiy of Ukraine to work with Giuliani and William Barr, the attorney general, on investigations that would bolster him politically.
Pompeo's letter appeared more likely to have an immediate effect on the unfolding case.
In a letter and a pair of tweets sent from Rome shortly after meeting with President Sergio Mattarella of Italy, the secretary described the Sept. 27 demand for the senior State Department officials' testimony as “an attempt to intimidate, bully and treat improperly" American diplomats.
“Let me be clear: I will not tolerate such tactics, and I will use all means at my disposal to prevent and expose any attempts to intimidate the dedicated professionals whom I am proud to lead and serve alongside at the Department of State," he wrote.
Standing with the Italian president, Pompeo ignored a question from journalists about his own participation in the July call between Trump and Zelenskiy that is at the heart of the impeachment inquiry.
House Democrats late last week subpoenaed Pompeo for documents and also asked for access to witnesses who were expected to speak to investigators this week. But given the recent disclosure that he also listened in on the call, Pompeo himself could be subpoenaed to testify.
The State Department witnesses who have been called for depositions include Marie L. Yovanovitch, the former U. ambassador to Ukraine who was recalled to Washington in May. Yovanovitch was instructed by the House to appear Wednesday.
It appeared more likely that Kurt D. Volker, the US special envoy to Ukraine, would appear on Thursday for his scheduled deposition. Volker resigned his State Department post on Friday, the same day the demand for his testimony was issued.

Texto completo: NEW HAVEN — Superintendent of Schools Carol Birks on Tuesday blocked on Twitter two reporters who cover the city schools.
Christopher Peak of the New Haven Independent reported Birks had blocked him at 3:06 p.m. Brian Zahn of the New Haven Register, in turn, said he had been blocked as well at 3:32 p.m.
Birks did not immediately respond to a request for comment about her rationale Tuesday afternoon. Another Register staffer who followed Birks on Twitter Tuesday was not blocked.
“It’s disappointing to see any public official restrict access to a journalist,” Zahn said in a statement Tuesday, noting he has covered New Haven’s public schools under three superintendents and through many changes.
Zahn said his “goal is to provide fair, holistic coverage of the entire school system.”
Peak declined to immediately comment Tuesday.
Case law is not yet clear whether it is legal for governmental officials to block members of the public on Twitter, although courts generally have ruled that it is unconstitutional to date.
The Second U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in June that President Donald J. Trump’s decision to block seven people on Twitter violated the protection of free speech offered by the First Amendment.
“The First Amendment does not permit a public official who utilizes a social media account for all manner of official purposes to exclude persons from an otherwise-open online dialogue because they expressed views with which the official disagrees,” wrote Judge Barrington D. Parker in the decision, which was posted for public consideration by the New York Times.
The Justice Department filed a petition to have the case reheard en banc in August, according to federal court records.
In the petition, department attorneys argue that the judges who made the June decision were too general in indicating that Trump, by blocking the users, had exercised governmental power.
“The constitutional right of an individual to express his views in a public forum comes into play only when the property in question is owned or controlled by the government and the individual’s exclusion from that property is the product of state action,” attorney Jennifer L. Utrecht said in the petition. “Here, the @realDonaldTrump account belongs to Donald Trump in his personal capacity, and his ability and decision to exclude individuals from that personal property are likewise independent of his public office.”
The @NewHavenSuper account, used by Birks, was created in January 2014. She became Superintendent in New Haven in December 2017.
Dan Barrett, legal director for the ACLU of Connecticut, said in a statement Tuesday that officials have the right to private Twitter accounts, but if they use “a social media page to inform the public about their government work, solicit input about government issues, and identifies the page with their office, they are using the page as a government actor.”
“If a public official is using a social media account as a government actor and blocks critics or reporters from seeing what that account has to say, they are most likely running afoul of the Constitution,” said Barrett. “The right to criticize the government is at the heart of the First Amendment, and courts have recognized blocking people from government social media accounts as infringing on that right.”
Zahn and Peak were unblocked at approximately 9:22 p.m.

ANALYSIS: Hunter Biden tied to China firm with questionable dealings

Texto completo: A high-ranking Chinese businessman was charged by the Justice Department with global corruption and bribery in 2017, and the first call he made after his arrest was to Vice President Joe Biden’s brother, James Biden, who thinks the call was meant for Joe Biden’s son, Hunter.

Patrick Ho, the lieutenant to the founder of the multibillion-dollar Chinese conglomerate CEFC China Energy, was indicted under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in the Southern District of New York for his role in a global money laundering and bribery scheme aimed at government officials in Africa. The Justice Department also accused Ho of helping with Iranian sanctions evasion and working to use the Chinese company’s connections to sell weaponry to Chad, Libya, and Qatar.

Ho immediately tried reaching out to the younger Biden for help because that summer, as investigators circled, Hunter agreed to represent Ho as part of Hunter’s efforts to work out a liquified natural gas deal worth tens of millions of dollars with CEFC China Energy’s leader Ye Jianming.

The vice president’s financier brother said he was surprised by the call from Ho, but told the Chinese businessman how to get in touch with his nephew.
“There is nothing else I have to say,” James Biden told the New York Times in 2018. “I don’t want to be dragged into this anymore.”

The lucrative deal Biden set up with CEFC China Energy fell apart when Ye Jianming disappeared after being detained by Chinese authorities in 2018, and Ho was sentenced to three years in federal prison in March.

Although much of the scrutiny of Biden’s global business dealings focuses on his controversial $50,000-per-month position with the Ukrainian energy company Burisma Holdings at the same time then-Vice President Joe Biden pressured the Ukrainian government to fire prosecutor General Viktor Shokin, his dealings with Chinese businessmen could cause the 2020 Democratic front-runner serious headaches, too.

Kathleen Biden, the younger Biden’s now-ex-wife, accused him in divorce filings of “spending extravagantly on his own interests (including drugs, alcohol, prostitutes, strip clubs, and gifts for women with whom he has sexual relations), while leaving the family with no funds to pay legitimate bills.” The filing also discusses a "large" diamond, worth $80,000 he claimed he no longer had. In a later interview, Hunter said the diamond — which he claimed was only worth $10,000 — was a gift from Ye Jianming.

Ye, who had ties to the Chinese Communist Party and told Caixin Global that his company “aims to serve the [Chinese] state’s strategy,” was on a mission to make inroads among powerful Democrats and Republicans, setting his sights on the former vice president's son, who served on the board of World Food Program USA, a nonprofit that raises money for the United Nations World Food Programme. Biden said he hoped Ye would make a major donation to the fund, but also offered to help Ye find investment opportunities inside the United States.

Biden says he met Ye for the first time in Miami, and that two of Biden’s associates surprised him when they gave Ye Scotch valued at thousands of dollars. Ye sent a thank-you card and a 2.8-carat diamond to Hunter’s hotel room. Hunter says he handed the diamond off to his associates and doesn’t know what happened with it, but denies it was meant as a bribe.

“What would they be bribing me for? My dad wasn’t in office,” Hunter told the New Yorker. “I knew it wasn’t a good idea to take it. I just felt like it was weird.”
Hunter negotiated a $40 million investment deal with Ye related to a liquefied natural gas project on Monkey Island in Louisiana.
At the same time, Ye told Hunter that one of his business associates, Ho, was being investigated in the U.S., and Hunter agreed to represent him. The deal between Hunter and Ye crashed almost immediately when Ho was arrested by U.S. law enforcement at John F. Kennedy Airport in 2017. A few months later, the deal was officially dead when Ye was detained by Chinese authorities, reportedly at the orders of Chinese President Xi Jinping.
“Patrick Ho schemed to bribe the leaders of Chad and Uganda in order to secure unfair business advantages for the Chinese energy company he served,” Manhattan U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman said in March. “His actions were brazen, including offering the president of Chad $2 million in cash, hidden in gift boxes. Foreign corruption undermines the fairness of international markets, erodes the public’s faith in its leaders, and is deeply unfair to the people and businesses that play by the rules.”
Biden said to The New Yorker this summer he didn't think Ye was "a shady character at all" and attributed the situation to "bad luck."

When books spread fake news

Texto completo: Poor fact-checking isn’t just the plague of websites and magazines. It’s disturbing the publishing industry. Just recently, several high-profile “experts” in their fields have promoted major factual errors in their books.
Due to a misunderstanding of historical terms, feminist author Naomi Wolf created “several dozen executions” that never happened.
Ex-New York Times executive editor Jill Abramson plagiarized passages and peddled factual errors in her ironically titled Merchants of Truth. (This should have come as no surprise to anyone who read her interview with New York magazine in which she boasted that she doesn’t need to record interviews.)
“Happiness expert” Paul Dolan based his entire book on a misunderstood statistic about married women being miserable, among other factual errors. (He thought spouses who were "separated" actually meant spouses were just in the other room when questions were being asked.)
Michael Wolff’s White House tell-all was similarly riddled with errors. And that’s just from this past year.
As detailed in a feature from the New York Times, these recent publishing flubs are disturbing writers and editors alike. Publishing houses don’t like to pay for fact-checkers, but neither do writers with modest advances. So who's going to check?
As costly as fact-checking may be, it's much more costly to reprint books or pull them from circulation. In both Wolf’s and Dolan’s cases, their entire theses fell apart upon scrutiny. Houghton Mifflin Harcourt had all the U.S. copies of Wolf's book recalled. Dolan merely pledged to correct his book.
Though some publishing houses may balk at the bother of fact-checking, a senior editor at Amazon Publishing, Barry Harbaugh, told the Times that the company has paid to fact-check many of its nonfiction titles.
“A lot of the time we talk about fact-checking in this defensive framework, like when something horribly wrong happens,” Harbaugh said. “But it’s also a way to lay many more hands on a story that’s being sculpted from facts, and it’s qualitatively improving the piece.”
What are readers to take away from all this? The publishing industry deserves as much scrutiny as other forms of media. The mere fact that it’s in a book does not make it any more reliable than what you can find anywhere else. Malcolm Gladwell shared an inaccurate statistic about poets' suicide rates by quoting a paper, which cited a book, which created the statistic based on three dozen poets who lived about 300 years ago. All it took to find the error was a little digging by The Atlantic's Andrew Ferguson. If something sounds wrong, check it out.
For those in the publishing industry, the takeaway is that writers and editors will have to come up with a better way to make sure that fact-checking happens early and thoroughly, so maybe they can restore the trust between writers and their readers.

Bitter twitter battle Trump embraces tweet that foresees Civil War-like split if he is ousted

Texto completo: With an impeachment inquiry underway, President Donald Trump tweeted Sunday that removing him from the presidency would cause a Civil-War level splintering of the United States, a reiteration of a comment made on "Fox and Friends."
The president tweeted a comment made by the Rev. Robert Jeffress on the TV show: "If the Democrats are successful in removing the President from office (which they will never be), it will cause a Civil War like fracture in this Nation from which our Country will never heal."
The president has also tweeted that Rep. Adam Schiff committed treason when he read a transcript of the president's call with the Ukrainian president. Local experts say the level of discord in our country is nowhere near Civil War conditions, but this type of rhetoric from the president can be dangerous.
"It doesn't take an expert to know that both of those statements by the president are utterly ridiculous," said Blaine Garvin, Gonzaga University political science professor. "... (What) he's saying is that if Congress were to remove him then there would be civil war and presumably he means his supporters would rise up in his support."
Dale Soden, Whitworth University history professor, said the difference between the conditions now and the conditions of our country pre-Civil War were extremely different.
"The forces that led to the American Civil War in 1861 were deep and broad in the sense that there were decades of events that had to do with the expansion of the slavery, (and) the role that the federal government and that the state governments played in all of that," Soden said.
Additionally, nothing Schiff did could be construed as treason, Garvin said.
"Nobody that I can see here has done anything remotely like that," Garvin said. "But this is part of Trump's general behavior. When he's done something wrong - which he does frequently - and is caught doing it, then he projects the same misbehavior on the people who are trying to reveal what he's done."
The Constitution defines treason as, "levying War against (the United States), or in adhering to their Enemies, giving them Aid and Comfort."
Cornell Clayton, director of the Washington State University Foley Institute, said this latest effort is a pattern for the president to punch back whenever he perceives a threat, and he expects the president's rhetoric to deepen as the impeachment process proceeds. Sen. Patty Murray also expects the president's language to continue.
"I'm sure the President will have a lot to say throughout this process, and that a lot of it will be alarming - but our responsibility is to our country and our democracy," Murray said in a statement. "That's what we need to stay focused on."
On Oct. 8, WSU is bringing in Steven Levitsky, the author of New York Times bestseller "How Democracies Die." Clayton said Levitsky's book explores how a lack of forbearance has been the death knell for democracies within the past 40 years.
"They've ended by electing people to office who are then anti-Democratic or despots who end up becoming tyrants," Clayton said. "One of the arguments they make is that democracy requires certain types of behaviors in order to survive and one of them is forbearance by political parties, that is to say that you have to be willing to treat the other side as if they are legitimate."
Clayton said that while Trump's tactics have worked for him in the past, it could backfire, and he risks alienating his more moderate supporters. Clayton pointed to the fact that in the case of the Civil War tweet, Rep. Adam Kinzinger, R-Illinois, rebuked Trump's comments.
"I have visited nations ravaged by civil war," Kinzinger, a former Air Force pilot, tweeted. "@realDonaldTrump I have never imagined such a quote to be repeated by a President. This is beyond repugnant."
